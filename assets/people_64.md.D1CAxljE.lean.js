The Chancellory Guard reports to a/the Castellan. It is unclear whether the times in office of the Castellans depicted in the series overlap or not. Unnamed Castellan The Castellan, played by Paul Jerricho, is a fictional character from Doctor Who. He is a member of the High Council of Gallifrey and is a Time Lord. He appears in two Doctor Who stories, Arc of Infinity and The Five Doctors. =Character history= In Arc of Infinity, the Castellan investigates a serious security breach on Gallifrey. He suspects the Doctor, who is sentenced to death. After the Doctor's termination fails, the Castellan is led to think that the Doctor is in league with President Borusa. Locating Borusa, the Castellan finds the Doctor with him. The Castellan pulls a gun on the Doctor intending finally to execute him. However, the real traitor Councillor Hedin jumps in front of the Doctor taking the Castellan's shot and dying. Confused, the Castellan looks on as Omega seizes control of the Matrix. As the Doctor attempts to thwart Omega, the Castellan develops a new respect for his former suspect. In The Five Doctors, the Castellan is seen to have voted with the rest of the inner council to overrule Borusa and summon the Master to rescue the Doctor from the Death Zone. The Castellan supplies the Master with a recall device that will emit a signal so that he can be transmatted back to the Capitol when he has something to report. Having refused to believe the Master is trying to help him, the Doctor takes the Master's recall device, dropped during a Cyberman ambush, and is transported by the Castellan, (who thinks he is retrieving the Master), to the Capitol where he learns that the Master was telling the truth. The Castellan had hoped the Doctor would know who was controlling the Death Zone but the Doctor does not although he suspects a high-ranking Time Lord of being responsible. The Doctor realises that he and his companions, Tegan and Susan, and the Master were found too easily by the Cybermen and opens the recall device to reveal a homing beacon contained within it. As the Castellan supplied the device, Borusa orders his office and living quarters to be searched despite the Castellan's protestations of innocence. A small casket containing the Black Scrolls of Rassilon, forbidden knowledge from the Dark Times is found in the Castellan's room. He denies having ever seen the casket. Borusa orders that he be taken to Security and authorises the use of the \\"mind probe\\" to \\"discover the truth\\". Obviously taken aback at the sudden turn of events, the Castellan protests loudly as he is led away. Borusa appears to set the Black Scrolls alight in the casket, shutting the lid on them the next moment. Out in the corridor, the Castellan screams in pain and the Doctor and Borusa exit the conference room to find the Castellan lying dead on the floor with a gun beside him. The Commander of the Chancellory Guard claims the Castellan was armed and trying to escape. Confiding in Chancellor Flavia, the Doctor states he has \\"known the Castellan too long... he was limited, a little narrow, always fiercely loyal to his oath of office. Any mention of the Dark Days filled him with horror.\\" The Doctor reveals he thinks that the traitor is still at large and it later transpires that the Castellan was framed by Borusa. =Behind the scenes= Director Peter Moffatt was able to rehire Paul Jerricho to reprise his Arc of Infinity role of the Castellan in The Five Doctors, but had to recast Borusa, (his new appearance explained by one of the Castellan's lines as a \\"new regeneration\\"), and replace the character of Chancellor Thalia with Chancellor Flavia. =After Doctor Who= The Castellan's line, \\"No, not the mind probe!\\" from The Five Doctors has a place in Cult TV Awards's Hall of Shame as the Worst Line of Dialogue for 2003 / 2004. This line has also been mocked by some Doctor Who fans, as has the character. Paul Jerricho makes appearances at Doctor Who fan events, such as signings and conventions.

According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 162 inhabitants. This town is located near the Sierra de Algair√©n in the comarca of Campo de Daroca.  Geography  Located in a small mound at the end of the plain of the same name, it is circumcised by the foothills of the Algair√©n mountain range, Bodegones mountain range, Pilones mountain range (also known as the Modorra Mountain Range) and Peco Mountain range.  Hydrography  Huerva river crosses the municipality of Mainar, which forms the border with the town of Villarreal de Huerva. There is also the Villarroya stream (known Vals√°uco on many maps) and Villarpardo stream. two streams, although geographically known as they are not geologically because they are the result of human activity. They were created the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in drainage channels (grooves) excessively wet, and therefore are not suitable for cultivation. This can be checked by looking at the long straight sections prospective currents and perfect angles and even the cobblestones of the current in many sections, it is instead of \\"El Alcocer\\" where the artificial production is the most obvious. The Villarpardo stream is excavated in part by differential erosion and partly by human labor between conglomerates (known as \\"guijo\\" \\"gravel\\" or \\"pebble\\") of the limestone left and right bank. Receives by the left the Rambla (the river), which in turn receives the ravine Valdelacebo left; and gets right to the gorges and Carralanga Carramanchones. The creek receives the right Sisones the throat; and left the Ca√±ada (throat) Alegr√≠a del T√≠o, the Ca√±ada del Moro (which in turn receives the Ca√±ada de la Vina) and the Ca√±ada del Gordo. In addition, there are also several irrigation canals (the acequias [irrigation ditches] \\"Los Ojos\\" and \\"El Reajo\\"); in fact, two small drainage channels, which prevents the water is used for irrigation. An example of irrigation created exclusively for irrigation canal is the Agua Somera Somera or Vega ( \\"shallow\\" and \\"superficial plain\\"), probably from medieval times. Special mention are the ravines ( \\"Barrancos\\") running in the town, the most important are those that flow into the Huerva river on its left bank: Barranco de la Fuente del Piojo, Barranco del Ontazo Barranco del Pozo Ropera ( formed by the union of the Barranco de los Bodegones with Dehesilla Barranco) Barranco del Despe√±adero (formed by the union of the Barranco del Molinillo and Barranco Oscuro) and Barranco de Valdefrasno. Most of them were once for the water, but after the forest policy of the former regime, excess pines touched the main flow of the currents, and it is rare that the currents have a lot of water after the spring.  Climate  The climate is continental Mediterranean, very extreme: strong frosts in winter (especially in February) and outside of the heat (but not as hard as the Ebro Valley). Temperatures of 13 or 14 below zero are normal, and the record low is still much lower.  History  Although Mainar existed before the twelfth century the first mention of Mainar in history are those of the repopulation of Alfonso the Battler and Pamplona, we are not Islamic and pre-Islamic very little new in the region. Most of the part of the present municipality witnessed the wanderings of San I√±igo, confessor Sancho III Major and it is well documented that withdrew into the mountains Tobed. The etymology of Mainar is clear, which is confusing because the name was chosen precisely. Mainar is a participle of a visigothic irregular verb \\"magan, main\\" which means \\"take heart on the battlefield.\\" Mainar was a member of the Community of Daroca Villages from 1248 until the dissolution of the same in 1833 with the formation of the current provincial division. So he shared the same historical events that shook the entire region. He suffered the agitations of the Carlist wars strongly enough because the surrounding mountains were favorable for the guerrillas to hide. He also suffered the turmoil of the Civil War (1936-1939). Just a few years Mainar has become part of the new regional structure known as the Campo de Daroca. Its mayor is Esmeraldo Marzo, one of the former mayors of Aragon, old \\"dinosaur\\" of the policy, regime changes have not affected him so that he has been able to stay in power since 1979.  Sites and Monuments  Santa Ana Church in Mainar, Zaragoza The parish church of Santa Ana, built in the sixteenth century with one of the best Moorish towers of Aragon, built in the Moorish style and in its interior altarpieces of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are preserved, and the size of centuries XV and XVI . She was sacked by Erik the Belgian in the 1980s, some pieces were recovered later. The most valuable piece (A statue of San Blas originated between 1400 and 1450) does not deserve the attention of so famous looter. There are also several stations of the cross ( \\"peirones\\"), including the peir√≥n San Ant√≥n (San Andr√©s sacred to the twentieth century) and peir√≥n of the Virgin of Pilar ( \\"peir√≥n of Virgen del Pilar\\") ; the hermitage of San Andr√©s (next peir√≥n San Ant√≥n); Romanesque hermitage of Santo Domingo (actually ruins); and several Celtic ruins.

Historian Juan Ignacio Molina said the Mapuche considered the mal√≥n to be a means of obtaining justice: Leaders such as Lientur used the mal√≥n against European colonists: it consisted of a fast surprise attack by a number of mounted Mapuche warriors against the white (huinca) populations, ranchs, settlements and fortifications in Chile and Argentina, with the aim of obtaining horses, cattle, provisions, and captives, often young women. The rapid attack without formal order did not give the targets time to organize a defense, and it left behind a devastated population unable to retaliate or pursue. In Chile, the Spaniards responded with a system of fortifications known as La Frontera, garrisoned by a standing army that patrolled the border along the Bio Bio River. In Argentina, where the Mapuche in the 19th century ravaged the southern frontier, the government responded by building wooden outposts and occasionally fortresses, e.g. Fortaleza Protectora Argentina, as well as the Zanja de Alsina. This trench covered hundreds of kilometers across the Pampas to make incursions more difficult, as well as prevent the raiders from driving large numbers of cattle back across the frontier. Ultimately, the Argentine government invaded and conquered the Mapuche in their territory in the Conquest of the Desert of the late 1870s. Many Mapuche were killed and thousands more taken prisoner.

According to the Spanish Statistical Institute (INE), the municipality had a population of 123 inhabitants in 2010. The pueblo is in the comarca of Campo de Daroca, about northwest of Daroca and just southeast of Murero in the Calatayud-Daroca depression. The Jiloca River passes to the west. The parish church is dedicated to the Conversion of St Paul. There are some remnants of defensive walls from the time of the Reconquista, when Alfonso the Battler, king of Aragon, forced a route through towards Valencia from Zaragoza. Situation Manchones is a small settlement situated at the base of a hill in the valley of the river Jiloca, between Calatayud and Daroca. The pueblo lies on an ancient route between the Meseta Central, the Ebro and the coast of the Levante, which was certainly established in Roman times. History Prehistoric remains have been found in the area and there is some evidence of Celtiberian settlement in Manchones. It has been suggested that the name of the pueblo derives from mancusos, gold coins in circulation in Aragon during the 11th century. Diego L√≥pez de Lobera, who served under Alfonso the Battler during the Reconquista, was given the castle of Manchones in 1152. In 1248, by grant from Jaime I of Aragon, Manchones was freed from its dependence on Daroca, becoming part of the Community of Daroca Villages, which was dissolved in 1838. Fiestas The festivities in honour of St. Vincent and St. Paul are held in the last weekend of January, coinciding with the feast of St. Valero in Zaragoza, while those in honour of San Roque usually last five days, ending with the feast of the saint on 16 August. On August 15 they celebrate with a pilgrimage and a feast in the town square. Buildings The parish church of the Conversion of St Paul was built in the eighteenth century on the site of a medieval church and was restored in 2004‚Äì2005. Its chapel is dedicated to the Virgen del Pilar which contains a late 17th-century baroque reredos. A 15th century wooden crucifix is housed in the sacristy. Surviving remains of defensive walls and towers indicate that Manchones was part of the defensive system for Daroca.

It belongs to the \\"comarca\\" (county) of Tarazona y el Moncayo. According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 807 inhabitants.  Geography  Location: Situated on the left bank of Queiles to NO of Zaragoza, neighbouring Navarra. Its relief is fairly flat with some inclination to the west of its territory. It is about 100 km far from Soria, Pamplona, Logro√±o and Zaragoza, 15 km from Tudela and 6 km from Tarazona. Moncayo mountain is 15 km to the south. Routes of access: Road N-121 Tarazona - Tudela.

In recent years, it has stopped the trend of depopulation that had begun in the 60's. This has been due to immigration, especially Romanians and Equatorians, and the big price of housing in nearby places like Tarazona, that makes people to live in Novallas, with lower prices. \\\\----  Government and administration  Novallas has its own council with seven counselors.  Economy  The main economic activity is agriculture, but gradually this activity has become less important compared with building, industry and services. The land is broken into a smallholding. It belongs to people who have received as inheritance and who are not farmers or are already retired. There are few young farmers. Almost all the land of the town is irrigated. The irrigation in areas near the river Queiles is more intensive. The main crops are olives, almonds, and cereal. Most of the orchards are used for own consumption, although there is some cultivation of fruit, tomato or other vegetables such as kale. Wine was important in the past, but now its existence is testimonial as Novallas does not belong to any of Protected Denomination of Origin nearby. Asparagus, of great importance in recent decades of the last century, is no longer one of the main crops. Despite belonging to PDO of Navarre asparagus, competition from countries with cheaper labor has been falling prices and that the presence of this crop in Novallas is testimonial. About livestock, there are some poultry farms, although this activity has declined in recent years. There are also some pig farms. The sheep farming remains important and there are still several flocks. Somer year ago, every family had a few sheep and goats that met in a communal farmyard called \\"la vicera\\" to form a communal herd. As for craft work and industry, basketry was traditional in Novallas and there were several factories and workshops devoted to it, but this activity has already been abandoned. The largest factory that currently exists is engaged in the manufacture of kitchen and bathroom furniture. Other activities include carpentry, metal works, and vehicle repair. The council just has built an industrial park, still to be occupied. An important amount of Novallers are working in industry and services in larger towns nearby, such as Tarazona, Tudela and Zaragoza or its suburbs. Building has always had some importance. There have been several gangs of masons and now there are one or two companies engaged in construction.  Media  The cultural magazine \\"La Toque\\" is the only periodical in the village. It is written by its volunteer inhabitants and promoted by the council.  History  The Roman era had in this part of Queiles valley a privileged place to settle their farms or villae, which are being studied by several researchers. Some of the main ditches of the town were built by that times. The Moors, surely the creators of the town which is now Novallas, remained here until 1610 (date of the expulsion of the Moors of Aragon). De la √©poca musulmana proviene granp arte de la magn√≠fica red de acequias que abastecen las huertas del pueblo y la estructura urbana en su parte m√°s Antigua. A big part of superb network of irrigation ditches supplying the orchards of the village and the urban structure in its oldest part where created during the Muslim domination period. Probably, the church was first a mosque and the castle has its origin in a Muslim stronghold. The conquest of Tarazona by Alfonso I, The Battler, was in 1119, so it is assumed that in that year was also taken Novallas, by someone named Fort√∫n Azn√°rez. Around this year should be the origin of the name of Novallas, Latin novalia = new places, fallow, ready to be cultivated, which would evolve to Novallas according to Aragones phonetic (in Castilian it had evolved to something like Novaja). Years after the conquest Lazarus, son of Fort√∫n Azn√°rez, donated the castle to the Templars. There are traces of stay of the Templars in the church, where there is a Templar cross carved on the outside of the apse. There is also a place between Novallas and Monteagudo with the name of Templars, which is supposed to correspond with the location of a hermitage used by them. The Moors continued to live in Novallas as Mudejar (Muslim people in Christian territory). They were the majority and had its own legal entity, as manifested through its \\"aljama\\" agreements, as well as participate in the council meetings. Cristian families lived in the neighborhood of San Miguel. Apparently, the fragmentation of this neighborhood could have been stocked according to the Fuero Jaqu√©s (equal houses for equal men). In this neighborhood there was a hermitage. Next to this hermitage there was a convent of monks. Being situated next to the border between Navarre and Aragon, it is possible that for some period may belong to Navarre after the death of Alfonso I and the separation of kingdoms. In fact it is known that the near villages of Malon and Vierlas belonged to Navarre. During the period 1356-1369, the so- called \\"two peters war\\" happened, between Peter I of Castile, the Cruel, and Peter IV of Aragon, the Ceremonious. During this conflict Novallas was taken by the Castilians, being recovered by the troops of the Bishop of Tarazona Pedro Perez. As in the rest of Aragon, in 1610 the Moors were expelled. Expulsion hit 59 houses and 295 people, who were the majority population. Novallas did not recovered from this depopulation until the 18th century. Heraldry: Flag of Novallas Old Coat of Arms of Novallas =Illustrious locals= Jes√∫s Luis Cunchillos Ilarri Jes√∫s Luis Cunchillos was born in 1936 in Novallas, Aragon, Spain.

Children ask the grandmothers snack (traditionally omelet with \\"chorizo\\" - Spanish red sausage) to go to eat at the place known as \\"Fuente Vieja\\" (old fountain), located on the banks of the river Queiles. The pilgrimage to Santipol is the second of three rotations that preceded the Ascension related to the blessing of fields. The pilgrimage begins with a procession to a hill in which there is a votive column from which the priest bless the fields. It is tradition for the council to give a bag of salty almonds and a piece bread to the participants. At San Blas day morning, the tradition is to bless the \\"roscones\\" (ring-shaped cakes). Novallas also celebrated San Ant√≥n and San Isidro. Eating: The \\"rancho\\" is the typical meal to eat in crew. It consists of a stew of pork, hare or rabbit with potatoes.

He was alternately known as \\"The Hermit of St. Bonnot\\" and \\"The Werewolf of Dole\\". The Werewolf of Dole, Gilles Garnier was a reclusive hermit living outside the town of Dole in the Franche-Comt√© Province in France. He had recently been married and moved his new wife out to his isolated home. Being unaccustomed to feeding more than just himself he found it difficult to provide for his wife causing discontent between them. During this period several children went missing or were found dead and the authorities of the Franche-Comt√© province issued an edict encouraging and allowing the people to apprehend and kill the werewolf responsible. One evening a group of workers travelling from a neighbouring town came upon what they thought in the dim light to be a wolf but what some recognised as the hermit with the body of a dead child. Soon after Gilles Garnier was arrested. Confession According to his testimony at trial, while Garnier was in the forest hunting one night trying to find food for himself and his wife, a spectre appeared to him offering to ease his troubles and gave him an ointment that would allow him to change into the form of a wolf, making it easier to hunt. Garnier confessed to having stalked and murdered at least four children between the ages of 9 and 12. In October 1572, his first victim was a 10-year-old girl whom he dragged into a vineyard outside of Dole. He strangled her, removed her clothes, and ate the flesh from her thighs and arms. When he had finished he removed some flesh and took it home to his wife. Weeks later Garnier savagely attacked another girl, biting and clawing her, but was interrupted by passersby and fled. The girl succumbed to her injuries a few days later. In November, Garnier killed a 10-year-old boy, again cannibalising him by eating from his thighs and belly and tearing off a leg to save for later. He strangled another boy but was interrupted for the second time by a group of passersby. He had to abandon his prey before he could eat from it. In 1572 he brutally attacked an unknown boy who was passing by and tore him in half by biting and tearing at his belly. In 1573 he strangled a girl, ate her flesh, and tore away her left leg and took it to his wife. Garnier was found guilty of ‚Äúcrimes of lycanthropy and witchcraft‚Äù and burned at the stake on January 18, 1574Luc Jaccottey and Brigitte Rochelandet, \\"L'ermitage Saint-Bonnot √† Amange: l'habitat de Gilles Garnier br√ªl√© comme loup garou √† Dole en 1574\\", Arch√©opages n¬∞ 25, april 2009, p. 41.. Even though Garnier was burned at the stake, his trial was done by the secular authorities and not by the Inquisition, as superstition was not judged by the Inquisition.Lea, Henry Charles.

On November 3, a group of around 500 American Indians with the American Indian Movement (AIM) took over the Interior building in Washington, D.C. It was the culmination of their cross-country journey in the Trail of Broken Treaties, intended to bring attention to American Indian issues such as living standards and treaty rights. The march had brought to Washington the largest gathering ever of Native Americans and supporters hoping to speak to government officials about their concerns and to gain change to help their peoples. A group of protesters went to Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offices at the national headquarters building, intending to negotiate for better housing on reservations and other issues. Protesters began the siege after interpreting a government refusal of their demands as a double cross.Paul Smith and Robert Warrior, Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee. New York: The New Press, 1996 Protesters began to vandalize the building in protest. They were not evicted on the first night. The takeover quickly gained national media attention. Protesters overturned tables and desks against the windows, fortifying against potential police attack. Some set fires in interior offices and the marble lobbies, destroying many historic documents. The demonstrators started to run out of provisions after several days. They would not allow police or any government representative to approach the building, so two children of BIA employees were recruited to bring in provisions. After a week, the protesters left, some taking documents with them, having caused an estimated $700,000 in damages. Their actions caused loss, destruction, and theft of many records, including important treaties, deeds, and water rights records, which some Indian officials said could set them back 50 to 100 years. While President Richard M. Nixon was preoccupied with achieving re-election in 1972, he had an interest in promoting tribal sovereignty; he had ended the termination of tribes that was part of 1950s policy. Interested in the decentralization of government, he fundamentally agreed that tribes likely could manage some of their operations better than a bureaucracy. He signed a law to restore one tribe to federally recognized status and supported legislation to allow tribes more control over managing programs for their people.  Preparation  AIM members had done research and organized to prepare for their 1972 cross-country journey and anticipated negotiating with the federal government. They researched, organized, and prepared in 1972 after the brief BIA takeover in 1971. Understanding the law was essential to bringing the claims of Indian tribes and the urban populations forward to policy makers and the courts. Volunteer attorneys and other scholars researched the laws, executive orders, and BIA budgeting and practices to inform the AIM agenda of exposing government misdirection and illegal practice. Indians were concerned about the lands they had lost through treaties, speculation, and corruption. They struggled to make lives on the small areas of reservations, often isolated from population centers. Momentum and support grew for AIM among younger Native Americans and First Nations peoples. Unlike in 1971, the groups were prepared and focused on their target. Sympathetic groups joined the planning: * The National Indian Brotherhood of Canada * Native American Rights Fund * National Indian Youth Council * National American Indian Council * National Council on Indian Work * National Indian Leadership Training * American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Drug Abuse = Others who endorsed the effort = * Native American Women‚Äôs Action Council * United Native Americans * National Indian Lutheran Board * Coalition of Indian-Controlled School Boards * Black Panther Party for Self Defense  Occupation  Indians from around the country swept into groups and converged on the Interior building on November 2, 1972, and stayed there for seven days. Richard M. Nixon celebrated a landslide presidential victory on November 7 as AIM‚Äôs 'Twenty Points' were presented to him. It reminded Nixon how unprepared he was to deal with Indian issues across the country and how he had failed in his effort to quell Indian pressures for reforms. The twenty points established Native American goals for their relations with the federal government. Twelve of the 20 points directly or indirectly address treaty responsibility in which the U.S. had fallen short. # Restoration of treaty making (ended by Congress in 1871). # Establishment of a treaty commission to make new treaties (with sovereign Native Nations). # Indian leaders to be permitted to address Congress. # Review of treaty commitments and violations. # Unratified treaties to go heard by the Senate for action. # All Indians to be governed by treaty relations. # Relief for Native Nations for treaty rights violations. # Recognition of the right of Indians to interpret treaties. # Joint Congressional Committee to be formed on reconstruction of Indian relations. # Restoration of of land taken away from Native Nations by the United States. # Restoration of terminated rights. # Repeal of state jurisdiction on Native Nations. # Federal protection for offenses against Indians. # Abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. # Creation of a new office of Federal Indian Relations. # New office to remedy breakdown in the constitutionally prescribed relationships between the United States and Native Nations. # Native Nations to be immune to commerce regulation, taxes, trade restrictions of states. # Indian religious freedom and cultural integrity protected. # Establishment of national Indian voting with local options; free national Indian organizations from governmental controls # Reclaim and affirm health, housing, employment, economic development, and education for all Indian people.  Presidential reaction  As AIM was occupying the BIA building in Washington, D.C., representatives of the Nixon administration were meeting with tribal chairmen in a scheduled meeting at the other end of the country in rural Oregon. A new organization was established, called The National Tribal Chairman‚Äôs Association. NTCA was presumably an outgrowth of the National Congress of American Indians, founded in 1944. Nixon promised the support of the federal government for ‚Äúfederally recognized‚Äù tribes. This excluded groups that had not been recognized, including tribes whose federal status had been terminated in the 1950s under federal policy of the time, which believed that some tribes were \\"ready\\" to assimilate into the mainstream. NTCA was given offices within the National Council on Indian Opportunity. Tribal chairmen discussed common issues, including how to manage limited resources. Some believed that ‚Äúurban Indians,‚Äù those members who had left the reservations to live elsewhere, should be excluded from tribal benefits, although such members often struggled economically even in cities. When AIM left the Interior building on November 8, the White House had agreed to discuss all 20 points except amnesty, which was to be addressed separately. An ‚Äúinteragency task force‚Äù was created, to be co-chaired by representatives of the White House and to include dozens of Indian organizations. The occupiers agreed to leave the building with the assurance that the White House would examine eligibility of Indians for governmental services; adequacy of governmental service delivery; quality, speed, and effectiveness of federal programs; Indian self-government; and congressional implementation of necessary Indian legislation. Nixon had a different opinion from the 1950s emphasis on termination of tribes and their governments. In line with ideas about decentralization of government, he believed that tribes likely could do better than a distant government agency in managing affairs of their people and serving them. On December 22, 1973 Nixon privately signed the Menominee Restoration Act; it returned Menominee Indians to full federally recognized tribal status, returning their land assets to trust status. He might have played more of a leadership role in these issues but was caught up in the Watergate scandal and resigned the next year on August 9, 1974.Laura Waterman Wittstock, Elaine Salinas, Susan Aasen, Visions and Voices: American Indian Activism and the Civil Rights Movement, Part 1, page 54 Since this period, other terminated tribes regained their federally recognized status by Congressional legislation. In addition, other tribes have achieved recognition, both through the BIA documentary process, a procedure developed in consultation with representatives of recognized tribes, and sometimes through direct Congressional action.

It was directed by Vincent McEveety, and stars Dean Jones, Sandy Duncan and Joe Flynn. Plot Scientist Albert Dooley (Dean Jones) struggles to pay the bills. His wife, Katie (Sandy Duncan) gets a recipe for applesauce wrong and gives it to her husband to take to work for lunch, hoping it will help cut down on the budget. In a humorous chain reaction, the duck Albert is testing steals the applesauce after Albert has thrown it away in the trash and then wanders into a radiation lab and becomes irradiated. Albert is ordered to get rid of the duck, so he figures he can give it to his son, Jimmy (Lee Montgomery) who has been wanting a pet, only to discover it now lays eggs with solid gold yolks. In a Pavlovian manner, the duck, named \\"Charley\\" (despite being female), lays an egg when prompted by the barking of a dog. At first, the only ones who know of Charley's golden yolks are Albert, Katie, Jimmy and Albert's friend, Fred, but as they sell the yolks of gold, they gain the attention of a suspicious neighbor, a government bureaucrat from the U.S. Treasury Department named Mr. Hooper (Joe Flynn). Hooper spies on the Dooleys in a haphazard manner, often suffering a mishap such as falling off a tree branch after being yelled at by Mrs. Hooper to leave the neighbors alone. However, Hooper sees a golden yolk laid firsthand, with Fred and Albert celebrating. Hooper warns his boss Rutledge (James Gregory) about the economic upheaval. Although Rutledge doesn't believe Hooper at first, a series of nationwide phone calls among politicians spreads rumors, culminating in Rutledge getting a phone call from President Nixon to \\"get that duck!\\" Albert becomes greedy and no longer cares for his son, which saddens Jimmy. The Treasury Department officials (with Mr. Hooper) soon arrive at the house and order the family to turn over the duck. Jimmy, watching from upstairs, climbs out the window with Charley and then rides off with a couple of teenage boys and their hot rod as the government officials try to seize Charley. Jimmy is then suspended on a ladder between two parking garages and Albert attempts to convince his son to grab his hand before the ladder falls. Jimmy tells his dad to go away, believing he only wants to save Charley, but when the ladder begins to break, he grows fearful and realizes that his dad is there to help. Right before the ladder falls, Albert saves Jimmy. Immediately afterwards, Albert is arrested for owning gold as a private citizen. The family ends up in court and the judge breaks an egg into a glass after Mr. Hooper (unsuccessfully) and then Albert (successfully) barks at the duck to prompt the laying of the egg, which surprisingly turns out to be an ordinary egg yolk, as the effects of the radiation had worn off. The judge dismisses the charges, as there is no proof of the duck laying golden eggs, and Albert tells the family that the golden duck was nice while it lasted, but at least they can keep the duck for their pet, now realizing that his family is more important than wealth. The judge remarks to Jimmy \\"If that duck ever lays another golden egg...bury it quick!\\" Cast *Dean Jones as Albert Dooley *Sandy Duncan as Katie Dooley *Joe Flynn as Finley Hooper *Tony Roberts as Fred Hines *James Gregory as Rutledge *Lee Montgomery as Jimmy Dooley *Jack Kruschen as Doctor Gottlieb *Virginia Vincent as Eunice Hooper *Jack Bender as Arvin Wadlow *Billy Bowles as Orlo Wadlow *Sammy Jackson as Frisby *Arthur Hunnicutt as Mr. Purdham *Frank Wilcox as Bank Manager *Bryan O'Byrne as Bank Teller *Ted Jordan as Mr. Forbes *Bing Russell as Mr. Smith *Peter Renaday as Mr. Beckert *Frank Cady as Assayer *George O'Hanlon as Parking Attendant *Jonathan Daly as Carter *Hal Smith as Courthouse Guard *Edward Andrews as Morgan Reception Million Dollar Duck was one of three movies that film critic Gene Siskel walked out on during his professional career, the other two being the 1980 horror film Maniac and the 1996 comedy film Black Sheep.

The music was a blend of Eastern and Western music, and the album enjoyed the same success as the duo's previous album Disco Deewane (1981). The album was re-released as Boom Boom in 1984, and was later re- released in 2004.

He made his Serie A debut with Cagliari on 13 September 1998, in a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Internazionale. He helped the team avoid relegation until the summer of 2000, as his side finished in second-last place in the league. Cagliari failed to obtain promotion back to Serie A in 2000‚Äì01 season, as they only managed a mid-table finish. Scarpi lost his regular place in the starting line-up during the 2001‚Äì02 season, to new signing Armando Pantanelli. =Ancona= Scarpi joined Ancona of Serie B in February 2002. He was signed by Serie A side Inter on 8 May 2002, but was loaned back to Ancona on 11 July 2002, where he won promotion from Serie B to Serie A once again. Due to his successful season with the club, his loan was extended on 15 July 2003. Although his second Serie A season was less successful, as he conceded 25 goals in 13 games and failed to prevent the club's relegation, he was signed by Genoa of Serie B on 8 January 2004. =Genoa= Once again, Scarpi helped Genoa obtain Serie A promotion during the 2004‚Äì05 season, but due to the club's involvement in a match fixing scandal, Genoa were relegated.

Scarpi returned to Serie B in the summer of 2006, for his 9th season in the Italian second division. Despite the departure of Gazzoli, and subsequently of the youth product Nicola Barasso in January, Scarpi lost his place in the starting line-up yet again to Rubinho.

Generally, any natural body of water that is larger than in size is public water. In certain New England states, this legal definition exists at both common law and statutory law.  History  As is often the case in the United States, the \\"law of great ponds\\" descended from early English common law. In 1890, Charles Doe, Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, described the development of the law of great ponds in Concord Mfg. Co. v. Robertson, a case concerning the rights of individuals to cut and remove ice from a pond adjacent to land they had leased, subsequently reducing the flow of water at a downstream mill. The rights of the ice harvesters and mill owners turned on the question of who owned the water in the pond. In the opinion, Chief Justice Doe stated that \\"[t]ide waters and large ponds are public waters. Whatever exceptions, if any, may be found, this is the rule.\\"Concord Mfg. Co. v. Robertson, 25 A. 718, 719 (N.H. 1890). The English rule used to distinguish between public and private waters was based on the limit of the tide, for those waters that were navigable were subject to admiralty jurisdiction. In the U.S., this rule had been extended to include navigable fresh water \\"reasonably capable of valuable use as a public way.\\"Id. at 720. However, it was not always clear that a pond ‚Äì isolated from the ocean or a navigable river, but otherwise in the public domain ‚Äì was reserved for public use. Furthermore, the ability to hunt and fish on public lands had been denied to citizens during feudal times, and that \\"system of legal inequality in the enjoyment of public property\\" was precisely what the colonists sought to avoid.Id. Thus, a new rule defining public waters needed to be established that was not based on the navigability of the waters. From the Concord Mfg. Co. decision:  Maine  A great pond is defined in Maine state statute as \\"any inland body of water which in a natural state has a surface area in excess of 10 acres (40,000 m¬≤) and any inland body of water artificially formed or increased which has a surface area in excess of 30 acres (120,000 m¬≤) except for the purposes of this article, where the artificially formed or increased inland body of water is completely surrounded by land held by a single owner.\\"Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. 38, ¬ß 436-A. The term \\"great pond\\" originally derives from colonial statutes pre-dating Maine's separation from Massachusetts. Special statutory regulations apply to land adjacent to great ponds for the purposes of shoreland protection and timber harvesting. Maine state law provides for public access to \\"great ponds.\\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. 17, ¬ß3860.  Massachusetts  A great pond is defined in Massachusetts statutes as a pond or lake that is in its natural state at least in size. This includes ponds that met the criterion at one time but are now smaller. Massachusetts General Law states that all great ponds must be open for fishing and boating, including providing reasonable access to the pond, except for reservoirs.  New Hampshire  In New Hampshire, public waters are defined by common law to include all natural ponds of more than . In addition to the common law definition of great ponds, similar definitions can be found in the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, for example, in the Wetlands Act, RSA 482-A:21.

Moreover, a little northward, in the municipality of Medinaceli, there is another main junction, this one heading north, towards Soria, representing the main access from Madrid to La Rioja and Navarre. As a result, Alcolea del Pinar has been an important hub for the road-related services, with a relatively large Guardia Civil (rural police) station, devoted to traffic control, and a base of the Ministry of Public Works, for the maintenance works of the A-2 highway (Madrid-Barcelona). Currently, the new high-speed rail line between Madrid and Barcelona goes just by side of the town, parallel to the A-2 highway. As a matter of fact, Alcolea del Pinar is situated in the highest point in the A-2 highway between Madrid and Barcelona (1200 meters above sea level, 3600 feet. Alcolea del Pinar has several touristic attractions, being the most relevant the 'Casa de Piedra' (Stone house).

History  Since the discovery of a Roman cupae (a tomb) in 1999 in the restoration of the St. Michael¬¥s Church, we know there was a Roman settlement in Alovera. This cupae was dated in the 1st or 2nd century. Juan Manuel Abascal and Armin Stylow, from Universidad de Alcal√°, concluded that the text written on the cupae was \\"(monument to) Pompeyo Fusco, 60 years old. It was commissioned by his wife Antonia Melusa\\". Apart from the cupae, it is thought that one of the column bases of the St. Michael¬¥s Church belonged to the peristyle of a Roman villa. Also we know there was a visogothic settlement in Alovera thanks to a couple of brooches which are on display at Museo Arquel√≥gico Nacional, in Madrid. This brooches known as fibulas were made in the 6th century by the cloisonn√© technique. The first documents to mention Alovera were written in the 16th century. By then, Alovera was a farmer settlement which lands belonged to the monasteries of St. Bartholomew of Lupiana, St. Clair and St. Bernard. In the 16th century, St. Michael¬¥s Church was built by master Nicol√°s de Ribero helped bay Juan de Buerga and Juan Ballesteros. In 1690 finished the construction. The church is composed of three naves, a bell tower and an atrium. The main altarpiece was built in the 17th century by Juan, Pedro and Francisco Gonz√°lez, followers of classical manichaeism. Also, there are a St. Gregory altarpiece made by the disciples of Juan de Borgo√±a and Juan Correa de Vivar and, in the sacristy, a Pieta painting by Willem Key. In 1626, Felipe II gives to Alovera the title of villa. Then, the Villahermosa de Alovera was sold to Lorenza de Sotomayor, marquess of Alovera. Nowadays, there is still a marquess of Alovera.

A physical, experienced, hard-working, and tactically intelligent player, Milanetto was usually deployed as a defensive or central midfielder, where he was also capable of operating as a deep-lying playmaker. In addition to his creativity, strength, playmaking skills, and his ability to control the tempo of his team's play, he was also known for his accuracy from set-pieces, penalties, and shots from distance. Career Milanetto began his career with Juventus in 1993; although he did not make a single appearance for the senior side during the 1993‚Äì94 season, he won the 1994 Torneo di Viareggio and the Campionato Nazionale Primavera with the Juventus Youth side. He later played for several different clubs during the following seasons, including Fiorenzuola, Monza (on loan), and Como. In 2000, he joined Serie C1/A side Modena, and helped the club to achieve successive promotions, eventually making his Serie A debut during the 2002‚Äì03 season. Following the retirement of Roberto Baggio in 2004, he joined Serie A club Brescia, where he was re- united with his former Modena coach Gianni De Biasi, although he was unable to save the club from relegation during his first season, spending his second season with the club in Serie B. In 2006, he transferred to Serie B side Genoa, where he remained for five seasons, helping the club to Serie A promotion. On 26 July 2011, after initially being linked with Lugano, it was announced that Milanetto had joined Padova, after a furious row with the Genoa supporters. The midfielder had been a very popular figure with the fans, but his rapport with the club's ultras was damaged when he hurled an insult at the Gradinata Nord during the Derby della Lanterna against Sampdoria, after providing the winning assist to Mauro Boselli. Match-fixing and retirement On 28 May 2012, Milanetto was arrested by Italian police for his alleged involvement in the Calcioscommesse sports betting scandal. He subsequently cancelled his contract with Padova, retiring from football in August 2012; he later took up a position as a scout for his former club, Genoa, in October 2013.

The benefits of latensification are applicable in astrophotography - capturing images of stars. Without latensification an image would come out with several visible stars and be a perfectly acceptable image. However, many areas of the image would contain 'sub-latent' images, or areas of emulsion which have not received sufficient light to be exposed enough to show up. If the film was pre-exposed, the threshold point of exposure could be reduced, so these 'sub- latent' images could become visible. More simply, the stars which would normally be too dark to expose the film would now be sufficiently bright to expose correctly. In general photography, this process is often referred to as pre-exposure or pre-flashing, and is used with both film and paper.

The fire, which started on Labor Day, September 3, 2007 scorched before being contained on September 19. Approximately 2,300 firefighters were involved in fighting the fire. Strong winds pushed smoke to the Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, Nevada and Idaho. In Plumas County, 500 homes were threatened by the Moonlight Fire; 100 residences were evacuated near Greenville in the North Arm area of Indian Valley, as the wild fire was still raging in the Plumas National Forest.  Cause and investigation  Ground to crown flame spread. USFS photo The cause of the fire was never clearly established. Federal and state officials accused Sierra Pacific Industries of negligence in the hiring and supervision of a logging contractor. State Court Judge Leslie C. Nichols concluded that the state could not prove its case and engaged in unethical conduct in its investigation and subsequent legal action. The Court ordered the State of California to pay some $32 million to the defendants to reimburse them for the money spent fighting the case. The state later appealed the ruling. After a Federal judge ruled that Sierra Pacific could be found liable for the fire even if its contractor did not start it, Sierra Pacific settled the federal case for $55 million and 22,500 acres of land.  District Court denial of motion to terminate settlement  On October 9, 2014 Sierra Pacific and other defendants filed a motion in Federal Court to terminate the settlement on the grounds that the investigation and prosecution were flawed and corrupt. As a result, on October 14, 2014 Chief Judge of the Eastern District of California Morrison C. England issued an order which referred the case to Alex Kozinski, then-Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for the assignment of a judge outside of the Eastern District of California to assure impartiality. Judge Kozinski declined to appoint a judge outside of the Eastern District to hear the case, which was then reassigned to Senior District Judge William B. Shubb, who issued an order denying the motion on April 17, 2015. The court ruled: \\"Defendants have failed to identity even a single instance of fraud on the court, certainly none on the part of any attorney for the government. They repeatedly argue that fraud on the court can be found by considering the totality of the allegations. Here, the whole can be no greater than the sum of its parts. Stripped of all its bluster, defendants' motion is wholly devoid of any substance.\\"  Appeals Court ruling  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed on July 13, 2017. United States v. Sierra Pacific Industries, 862 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2017). In a unanimous opinion, the court ruled that all of Sierra Pacific's accusations were legally insufficient, because it \\"voluntarily settled instead of going to trial\\" and \\"bound [itself] not to seek future relief.\\" In addition, the court explained that the accusations of misconduct that Sierra Pacific claimed to have learned of after the settlement \\"do not constitute fraud on the court,\\" and it was not a fraud for government counsel \\"to have their own theory of the case and discuss it with their witnesses.\\"  Supreme Court denial of certiorari  On June 25, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.

It made history when it joined the Union Pacific No. 119 at Promontory Summit, Utah, during the Golden Spike ceremony commemorating the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. The Jupiter was built in September 1868 by the Schenectady Locomotive Works of New York, along with three other engines, numbered 61, 62, and 63, named the Storm, Whirlwind, and Leviathan, respectively. These were then dismantled and sailed to San Francisco, California, loaded onto a river barge, and sent to the Central Pacific headquarters in Sacramento. After reassembly they were commissioned into service on March 20, 1869. History The Jupiter leads the train that carried Leland Stanford, one of the \\"Big Four\\" owners of the Central Pacific Railroad, and other railway officials to the Golden Spike Ceremony Celebration of completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, May 10, 1869, showing the name Jupiter on the side of the tender The Jupiter was not Leland Stanford's original choice for transporting his party to the Golden Spike site. Originally, Stanford's train was to be pulled by another Central Pacific locomotive, the Antelope. For some distance, this train followed closely behind a regularly scheduled train pulled by the Jupiter. However, at one point the two trains were to go through a cut where a logging camp resided atop the hill. Apparently, the proper flag to designate an extra following close behind either had not been worn by the Jupiter, or had been unnoticed by the workers, and once the Jupiter passed, the workers rolled a large log down the mountain, which struck the Antelope. With the engine damaged, a message was sent to the upcoming station to hold the approaching train. There, Stanford's consist was added to the Jupiters train. Post-ceremony career After the ceremony, Jupiter continued in service for the Central Pacific. In the 1870s, the railroad decided to end their practice of naming their engines, and thus, the Jupiter name was dropped and the engine was simply known as C.P. #60. The locomotive also received many upgrades, including a new boiler, cowcatcher, domes, and smokestack. In 1891, the Southern Pacific, which acquired the Central Pacific in 1885, began renumbering its locomotives, and C.P. #60 became S.P. #1195. In 1893 it was converted to burn coal, and later that year was sold to the Gila Valley, Globe and Northern Railway and designated GVG&N; #1. In 1909, the railway, which had been acquired by the Southern Pacific in 1901, sold the engine for scrap. Reproductions A Golden Spike ceremony reenactment at the 1949 Chicago Railroad Fair, with the Virginia and Truckee railroad's Genoa painted and lettered to resemble the Jupiter right The Southern Pacific, by 1901, had been placed under the control of the Union Pacific, the management of which remained largely indifferent towards both the Jupiter and the railroad's own no. 119, acknowledging neither's historical significance until well after being scrapped. For events such as the 1939 New York World's Fair and the Chicago Railroad Fair, the Virginia and Truckee Railroad's cosmetically altered Genoa locomotive stood in for the Jupiter in reenactments of the Golden Spike ceremony. The 1939 film Union Pacific also featured a recreation of the ceremony, in which the Jupiter was portrayed by Virginia and Truckee Railroad's Inyo. In 1969, in observation of the centennial of the Golden Spike, the Genoa again portrayed the Jupiter, operating on a section of restored trackage at the Golden Spike National Historic Site with the Virginia and Truckee's Reno portraying the Union Pacific no. 119. The same year, the Union Pacific operated a special exhibition train, consisting of the Virginia and Truckee's Inyo and Dayton as proxies, along with vintage railroad construction equipment, all displayed on flatcars, which toured various parts of the Union Pacific network through the year. In 1970, the Reno was sold to Old Tucson Studios, while the Genoa was returned to the state of California, with the Inyo and Dayton replacing them as displays at Promontory. In 1974, the National Park Service had approached O'Connor Engineering Laboratories of Costa Mesa, California, to construct exact, full-size replicas of the Jupiter and Union Pacific 119. As was the case with the engines themselves, no drawings or plans of the engines survived, necessitating entirely new drawings to be produced based mostly on photos of the engines as well as research done on similar engines built around the same time. That same year, the existing engines portraying the Jupiter and 119 (the Inyo and Dayton, respectively), had been sold to the state of Nevada, though they remained displayed at the Golden Spike NHS until the construction of the new replicas was complete. Noted railroad historian and steam engine owner Gerald M. Best served as engineering consultant to the Park Service for the project. Former Disney animator Ward Kimball was given the task of painting the replicas. The Jupiter was given a bright red paint scheme with gold leafing, typical of locomotives built in the 1870s. The replicas were completed in 1979, and began operations on May 10 of that year, 110 years after the original Golden Spike ceremony, and continue to make demonstration runs. In the early 1990s, a vague description of the Jupiters livery had been found in a recently uncovered March 1869 issue of The Sacramento Bee, in which the engine was said to be blue, crimson, and gold. The engine was repainted into its current livery based on this finding along with further research on liveries of similar engines of the time. The repainted engine debuted on May 10, 1994, coinciding with the 125th anniversary of the Golden Spike ceremony. Other historic Jupiter locomotives The replica of Jupiter's sister engine, Leviathan, (C.P. no. 63) operating at the 2009 Train Festival Jupiter was known as \\"King of Gods\\" or \\"God of Sky\\", and it was common for railroads of the 1800s to name engines after this and other mythological legends to invoke awe and wonder. Thus, there have been many engines named \\"Jupiter\\" by their respective railroads that, apart from the name, had little else in common with the engine of Golden Spike fame. One such engine is Santa Cruz Railroad no. 3, also named Jupiter. This engine, owned by the Smithsonian Museum, is also a wood-burning 4-4-0. However, this engine was built for narrow-gauge track, unlike the broader standard gauge of the trains at the Golden Spike ceremony. In 2009, Kloke Locomotive Works built a full-size replica of one of the Jupiter's sibling engines, the Leviathan, no. 63, which currently resides on the Harrisburg, Lincoln and Lancaster Railroad.
