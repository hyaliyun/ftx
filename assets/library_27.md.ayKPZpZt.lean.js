X being low says that its jump X′ has the least possible degree in terms of Turing reducibility for the jump of a set. A degree is low n if its n'th jump is the n'th jump of 0. A set X is generalized low if it satisfies X′ ≡T X + 0′, that is: if its jump has the lowest degree possible.

This implies that, although low sets are computationally weak, they can still accomplish such feats as computing a completion of Peano Arithmetic.

He was important, not only because of the prolific nature of his practice and the quality of his work, but also because of the range and the scale of his built and speculative projects. These extended from conventional essays to monumental urban schemes informed by his international travel, especially in America. His influence was specifically felt in Dunedin, Wellington and Hastings, yet he also realised projects in Alexandra, Invercargill, Palmerston, Palmerston North, Rotorua, Waimate North and Wanaka. His key works include the 1925–26 New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition, the 1940 New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, the Herd Street Post and Telegraph building, Anscombe Flats, the Empire Deluxe theatre and his work on the clocktower complex – including specifically the Archway Building and Marama Hall – effectively re-conceiving the design of the University of Otago's historical core.(University of Otago Clocktower complex). His sister is painter Eliza Anscombe  Biographical background  Anscombe was born on 8 February 1874 in Lindfield, Sussex, England. His parents Edmund and Eliza Anscombe (née Mason) emigrated on 27 June 1874 to New Zealand on the Christian McAusland in the assisted immigration scheme. They arrived in Dunedin with seven-month-old Edmund and his two-year-old sister Eliza. His father is described as a carpenter aged 25 years old from Sussex. His mother was 28. They arrived in Otago, New Zealand on 30 September 1874. His sister Edith Violet was born in Dunedin on 1 April 1885. Edmund attended Caversham School (from 1879–1885) and in 1888, as a 14-year-old boy, he left New Zealand on what, in most accounts, is seen to be a prophetic visit to the 1888 Melbourne exhibition. In his own words: > \\"From then onwards anything pertaining to Exhibitions held for me its own > decided and never ending interest.\\" (Anscombe Inside Story) This lifelong interest in the design of exhibition buildings was furthered by: his attendance at the 1889–90 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin, involvement in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St Louis (1904), his appointment as architect to the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition Company (1924–25), attendance at the Chicago World's Fair (1933) and the New York World's Fair (1939), and his appointment as the architect of the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition (1940). Whether the exhibition was the primary reason for his visit to Melbourne cannot be known for certain, but on his return Anscombe became an apprentice carpenter in Waiwera South, Otago, and worked for his father as a builder. This experience perhaps influenced his later architectural work which he approached with an entrepreneurial pragmatism. He married Douglas Watt in 1898 after which they lived with Edmund's parents. His first child, Ruby, was born 1899. In 1911 his second daughter, Marjory, was born. In 1901 Anscombe travelled to America. This 1901–1906 trip is the most written about of his travels. He visited St Louis Purchase Exposition where he \\"received ... practical training in exhibitions in 1904\\" and it is during this time that he is said to have studied architecture, an idea first asserted in an obituary but something Anscombe himself does not refer to.  Architectural practice in Dunedin  Hanover Street Baptist Church, Dunedin On their return to Dunedin, the Anscombes enrolled Ruby at High St School (24 July 1907). Described as \\"an architect now resident in Dunedin, who has had considerable experience in the United States,\\" Anscombe won the University of Otago School of Mines competition in 1907 under the pseudonym: \\"Esperanto.\\" This winning entry began his productive relationship with the university council which in 1911 conferred on him the position of university architect – a position he retained until 1928 when he left Dunedin for Wellington. This position gave him access to commissions across the university including: extensions to Maxwell Bury's work, Allen Hall (1914), the Domestic Science building (1918), the Physics building (1922), Marama Hall (1923), the Dental school (1924), and the Medical school (1927). Anscombe's early and consistent success in competitions (which included: the School of Mines (1907), Hanover Street Baptist Church, Dunedin (1912), Y.M.C.A. (1910), Central Hall (1910), and Otago Girls' High School (1910 and 1921 ) – where he won first and second place ) coincided with a number of ecclesiastical commissions: St. Clair Presbyterian Church (1909), Oamaru Presbyterian Church (1910), Musselburgh Presbyterian Church (c1910), Mornington Baptist Church (1910/11), North East Valley Presbyterian Church additions (c. 1913), Opoho Presbyterian Church (1913), and residential design work for: Mr Turnbull, for a residence on The Crescent, Roseneath (c.1936), Mr. Ivory (c.1909), Thomas Fogg (c.1910), Rev. James Chisholm (c1910), H. C. Campbell (1911), H. S. Bingham (1913), Thomas Thomson (c.1914). These early years in Anscombe's practice were also early years in the history of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (N.Z.I.A), which began as a national organisation in 1905. Anscombe was elected a Fellow of the N.Z.I.A. in 1912. He also contributed an article entitled: \\"The Economic Value of Scientific Town Planning\\" to an N.Z.I.A. conference. About 1916, Anscombe began experimenting with a concrete block dry wall system. It was at this time he designed \\"Cintra,\\" his house in Andersons Bay, Dunedin, which was constructed in these \\"O.K. blocks\\" which he patented in 1920. Shortly after this Anscombe's mother died at the age of 66 years on 2 July 1921. Anscombe's practice continued to flourish and commissions from this time included the Maheno and Marama Hospital Ships' Surplus Fund Memorial Hall (1919/1923), the Lindo Ferguson Building (1927), the University of Otago Dental School (1924), Arthur Barnett's Department Store (1924), now part of the Meridian Mall, Dunedin, Messers Herbert, Haynes and Co Ltd building (1925), Logan Park Grandstand (1929) and, of course, the design work for the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition (1925–26), including the still surviving art exhibition building (1924), which involved a number of overseas trips specifically to Melbourne to consult with the engineer of the scenic railways in Melbourne. Anscombe was utterly proactive in finding work and both the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition (1925) and the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition (1940) were initiated by him but it seems this proactive approach may have alienated him from some sectors of the architectural profession. The first signs of this appear at the time an architect was to be appointed for the 1925 exhibition and is documented in an exchange of letters between Anscombe and the N.Z.I.A. regarding this subject. The N.Z.I.A. had offered to donate > \\"a Lay-out Scheme on any Site ... [and] act in an Honorary Advisory capacity > in approving and if necessary suggesting improvements to any design.\\" Later they advocated that the design work be apportioned to individual architects. Anscombe queried the N.Z.I.A. offer of a \\"donated\\" plan which, it seems, fast became conditional on the assurance of further work and he described this as \\"decidedly infra dig and a breach of etiquette on the part of ... the Institute much to be regretted.\\" He made clear his opposition to the dividing of architectural responsibility, arguing that in his opinion it was not in the best interests of the Directors. In a later N.Z.I.A. meeting he was accused of \\"competing against the Institute for the work\\" and was asked to \\"retire from the Meeting.\\" A similar situation occurred later with reference to the 1940 exhibition when Anscombe found himself opposed by the collective group of local architects. In that instance, it was Anscombe's ability to produce work quickly which ensured he got the commission.  Travels 1928–1929  In 1928, after leaving Dunedin, Anscombe embarked on a longer world trip accompanied by his two daughters now aged 29 and 17 years. They left for this trip in early March 1928 and travelled to the Middle East (Egypt, Greece, Palestine, and Turkey), Britain (England, and Ireland), and Europe (Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland) concluding the journey in America before returning to New Zealand via Honolulu and Suva. The Dominion reports the group's recent return in April 1929. On this trip, Anscombe seemed particularly interested in architecture, city and street planning, and the use of lighting at night time. While they were abroad Anscombe's father died on 8 August 1928 at Ashburton at the Tuarangi Home for old men. The trip bridges Anscombe's practice in Dunedin and his practice in Wellington. There are various speculations as to why Anscombe, a well established architect in his mid-fifties, made the move to Wellington at this time. Shaw attributes Anscombe's move to the need \\"to be ready to design the Centennial of New Zealand Exhibition of 1939–40,\\" while McNeill notes the timing of Anscombe's departure coincides with the publication of The Inside Story which \\"would have made it difficult for him to remain in Dunedin.\\"  Architectural practice in Wellington  Post and Telegraph Building next to Waitangi Park in Wellington In Wellington Anscombe set up a practice on The Terrace and he and his daughters lived on Oriental Parade at the back of the section Anscombe was later to build Lyndfield (now Anscombe Flats). They lived there until the apartment block was completed in the late thirties. These apartments, like many projects during the inter-war depression, were built on the \\"No. 13\\" scheme where a percentage of the project's cost was met by Government funding. The Anscombes occupied the penthouse flat at Lyndfield, which, when his daughters married and left home, became a place of regular extended family gatherings. The flat was also where Anscombe trialled drafts of his schemes, letters, and proposals in front of his architect sons-in-law, daughters and grandchildren for discussion and feedback. Anscombe employed a small office in Wellington which designed a range of work including residential apartments (Lyndfield and Olympus on Oriental Parade, Franconia on The Terrace (1938), Belvedere at the corner Austin and Majoribanks Streets), Hamilton Flats (Hawker Street) and commercial and institutional projects including: the Post and Telegraph Building, Herd St (1939), Dominion Motors, the Island Bay kindergarten, and the Lloyd St, Disabled Soldiers' Vocational Centre (1943). His work in the Hawke's Bay area included offices and a wool store for the New Zealand Shipping Co. Ltd at Port Ahuriri, Washpool Homestead, the Farmers Co-operative Association Building, Westerman & Co (1932), and the State Theatre (1933–34) with Vernon Brown in Hastings. One of his longest serving staff in this Wellington office was Mrs. Ethel Bulté, who was known as \\"Auntie Pat\\" by Anscombe's grandchildren. She was Anscombe's secretary and is remembered by the grandchildren as always wearing black, her \\"grey hair pulled back into a bun\\" with the appearance of being an \\"efficient secretary.\\" She remained a friend of the family even after Anscombe died. Once established in Wellington, and after the extension of his office into the Hawke's Bay following the 1931 earthquake, Anscombe travelled to the United States again visiting the Chicago World's Fair for three weeks in July 1933. On this same trip he visited Long Beach, California where he was \\"\\"very impressed with the beautiful waterfront feature enclosing an area of of still water.\\"\\" This influenced his 1945 proposal for a bandshell and amenities on a wide promenade wall to enclose of still water with an illuminated fountain at Oriental Bay, published in The Evening Post in February 1945. Such schemes were sometimes extensions of building projects as in the case of the Post and Telegraph Building in Herd St which shaped a proposed gardens in Chaffers Park part of a plan, which was realised, to extend Cable St as \\"a new approach to Oriental Bay.\\" Anscombe also contributed to the discussion of the shaping of the Civic Centre, publishing a scheme in The Dominion in June 1934. In early May 1940, Anscombe anticipated travel to America and wrote to the Minister of Supply, Dan Sullivan, that he was > \\"anxious to visit the United States shortly – primarily to visit both the > San Francisco and New York Worlds Fairs – but while there I intend to check > up on the latest development in Combined Factories, Housing, City Planning > Schemes generally, Air Port Schemes, Bus Termini Stations etc.\\" (unpublished > letter to D.G. Sullivan, Minister of Supply, May 1940) He offered to report on these to the Minister on his return. Sullivan replied asking Anscombe to \\"particularly look at the latest developments in that country with a view to translating them into a concrete proposal for this country.\\" On this trip Anscombe visited: the Douglas aircraft works, Santa Monica, the Curtis Wright Corporation, St Louis, the Lockheed factory, the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, San Diego, and the Packard Company. He furnished a report to Sullivan dated 16 January 1941 in which he outlined the American context which supported the building of combined factories and referred Sullivan to his 1919 brochure: Modern Industrial Development. Two years later he published such a scheme for Aotea wharf in Wellington.  Town planning  The 1925 and 1940 exhibitions also provided Anscombe with opportunities to suggest urban redevelopment schemes which would impact on each host city long after the period of the exhibition. In an article from June 1924, Anscombe outlined a proposal for a highway reserve, a park system, city zoning and housing, influenced by \\"the park and parkway system of Kansas City\\" and in keeping with Anscombe's \\"municipal housekeeping on scientific lines\\" outlined in his 1915 paper: \\"The Economic Value of Scientific Town Planning.\\" The proposal was not implemented exactly as Anscombe suggested yet much of his intention has persisted, including the tree-lined Anzac Avenue and Logan Park, in Dunedin. This desire to ensure that temporary projects also served longer-term strategies is also seen in the anticipation that, like the San Francisco Treasure Island Fair, the 1940 New Zealand Centennial Exhibition buildings should be reconverted for use as airport buildings and that exhibition art galleries should be permanent. He also proposed an urban scheme for Wellington with a similar interest in long-term \\"betterments.\\" Here he argued for an exhibition site close to central Wellington, in preference to Rongotai, maintaining that the central location was important and provided an opportunity \\"to carry out a much-needed improvement work\\" in the Adelaide road area. This central location was to take advantage of such already existing facilities as Government House, the Public Hospital, Wellington Boys' College, and the Museum and Art Gallery.  Architectural writing  In addition to his architectural work Anscombe was an avid writer. During his lifetime he published a number of books and pamphlets and regularly published articles in local newspapers (both in Dunedin and in Wellington) writing on subjects ranging from urban planning and new building materials to the recollections of his travels. Anscombe's next travel overseas was an extensive tour of Canada and the United States where he visited \\"over fifty Canadian and American cities\\" in 1922. On this trip he learnt about building methods and town planning and continued his \\"keen interest in the construction of museums and art galleries ... making a special study of these buildings.\\" The year following his return, his wife Douglas died aged 49, on 11 September 1923.  Final years  Anscombe died on 9 October 1948, working up until his death. His funeral was held two days later at St John's Presbyterian church, Willis St on 11 October 1948. He was cremated at Karori and is buried in Andersons Bay Cemetery in Dunedin. His will was filed on 20 October, his estate valued at £20,757 17 shillings and 8 pence. In addition to relatives, St John's Presbyterian Church and the Crippled Children Society Wellington Branch were beneficiaries. An obituary in October 1948 in the Dominion, noted of the funeral that: > \\"The New Zealand Institute of Architects was represented and nearly every > member of the Wellington branch attended. Most of the leading building firms > of the city were also generously represented.\\"  References  * Anscombe, Edmund The inside story of the New Zealand & South Seas International Exhibition Dunedin, 1925–1926 (London: E.

It was first published in the June 1955 issue of Fantastic Universe and reprinted in the 1957 collection Earth Is Room Enough. Although humorous, it deals inter alia with a serious subject, calendar reform. Plot summary By order of the Council of Ascendants and approved of by the Chief, it is decided that the Day of Resurrection is due on Earth, despite the protestations of Etheriel, a junior Seraph with responsibility for the world. Whilst he seeks an audience with the Chief to plead for a stay of execution for \\"his\\" planet, the Last Trump is sounded, and as of January 1, 1957, time comes to a stop on Earth. A manufacturer of breakfast cereal pleads with God to defer Judgement Day, since no one will need his product any more. A mysterious figure known only as R. E. Mann (a pun on Ahriman, the Persian name for Satan)—later revealed as the devil—makes his way across the world, seeing what has happened in the Hereafter and pleased with it. All the dead are coming back to life, naked and uncaring. He meets a former professor of history who observes that the people have indeed been judged and are not in heaven but hell. Etheriel has his meeting with the Chief and argues that the date January 1, 1957, unqualified, is meaningless and that therefore the Day of Resurrection is meaningless. The Chief agrees and declares that it will come only when all the peoples of the Earth agree on a common date (which, given the wide variety of cultures on Earth, is extremely unlikely to ever occur). The world is instantly restored to normality. R. E. Mann, frustrated in his endeavours, plans to promote the adoption of a new calendar system, based on the Atomic Era, to begin on December 2, 1944.

That condition of the normal eye is achieved when the refractive power of the cornea and the axial length of the eye balance out, which focuses rays exactly on the retina, resulting in perfect vision. A human eye in a state of emmetropia requires no corrective lenses; the vision scores well on a visual acuity test (such as an eye chart test). For example, on a Snellen chart test, emmetropic eyes score at \\"6/6\\"(m) or \\"20/20\\"(ft) vision, meaning that at a distance of 20 ft (the first number) they see as well as a normal eye at a distance of 20 ft (the second number). Either myopic (near-sighted) eyes or hyperopic (far-sighted) eyes would score worse, e.g. 20/40 (visual acuity roughly half normal). Exceptionally acute vision (excellent cornea and lens and better than standard retina) might be 20/15. Overview Emmetropia is a state in which the eye is relaxed and focused on an object more than away. The light rays coming from that object are essentially parallel, and the rays are focused on the retina without effort. If the gaze shifts to something closer, light rays from the source are too divergent to be focused without effort. In other words, the eye is automatically focused on things in the distance unless a conscious effort is made to focus elsewhere. For a wild animal or human prehistorical ancestors, that arrangement would be adaptive because it allows for alertness to predators or prey at a distance. Accommodation of the lens does not occur in emmetropia, and the lens is about 3.6 mm thick at the center; in accommodation, it thickens to about 4.5 mm. A relatively thin lens and relatively dilated pupil are also associated. The lens usually stiffens with age, causing less ability to focus when the eyes are not in a state of emmetropia.Saladin, Kenneth S. \\"16.\\" Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2012. Print. Corrective eye surgery such as LASIK and PRK aims to correct anemmetropic vision. This is accomplished by ensuring the curvature of the cornea, the shape of the lens and their distances from each other and the retina are in harmony. By shaping the cornea, emmetropic vision can be achieved without corrective lenses. The correction for only emmetropic vision is often the reason that patients are advised to keep wearing glasses to read as they age because of presbyopia.\\"Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) Eye Surgery\\"  Emmetropization  Eyeball lengths: far-sighted (hyperopic), emmetropic, and near-sighted (myopic). The development of an eye towards emmetropia is known as emmetropization. This process is guided by visual input, and the mechanisms that coordinate this process are not fully understood. It is assumed that emmetropization occurs via an active mechanism by which defocus drives growth of the eye and that genetic factors and emmetropization both influence the growth of the eye's axis. Newborns are typically hypermetropic and then undergo a myopic shift to become emmetropic. There has been some research on causal factors involved in the development of myopia and of hyperopia. In particular, statistics show that prolonged near work correlates with the development of myopia, but it is still unclear whether there is a causal relation. Furthermore, outdoor activity has been found to have a protective effect on myopia development in children. It has long been assumed that wearing corrective spectacles might possibly perturb the process of emmetropization in young children, with this assumption being supported in particular also by animal studies. However, undercorrection of myopia in humans has been shown to increase the rate of myopic progression. However, it is not yet fully understood for which patient groups, if any, the wearing of corrective spectacles in childhood actually impedes emmetropization. In hyperopic children, yet more factors are to be considered: Hyperopia is known to be a significant risk factor for esotropia, therefore undercorrection may have the side effect of increasing this risk.\\"Children with a greater degree of hyperopia are at a greater erisk to become esotropic; thus, a dilemma exists in presribig convex lenses to prevent the deviation as opposed to a possible interference with the emmetropization process.\\" Quoted from: There is widespread consensus that undercorrection is counterindicated for children with accommodative esotropia. It is still unclear for which hyperopic, non- strabismic children corrective spectacles may translate to a lower strabismus risk. There are indications that emmetropization is relevant for hyperopic children who have at most about 3.0 diopter, whereas children with stronger hyperopia seem to not change their refraction independently of whether the refractive error is corrected or not. A Cochrane Review of three trials seeking to determine whether spectacle correction reduced the occurrence of strabismus in children included one study which suggested that spectacle correction perturbed emmetropization in children, while a second study reported no differences. Etymology \\"Emmetropia\\" is derived from Greek ἔμμετρος emmetros \\"well-proportioned\\" (from ἐν en \\"in\\" and μέτρον metron \\"measure\\") and ὤψ ōps \\"sight\\" (GEN ὠπός ōpos). Translated literally, the term indicates the condition of an eye's having in itself (i.e., without recourse to corrective lenses or other instruments) the capability to obtain an accurate measurement of an object's physical appearance.

He was a right-handed opening batsman and became a regular member of the Rhodesian side for 15 years starting in 1957–58, at one stage captaining them. His highest score was an innings of 279 not out made against Orange Free State in 1967–68. This remained a Currie Cup record for some years. His son Trevor played Test cricket for Zimbabwe, also as an opening batsman. Personal life Gripper was born on 7 July 1938, in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, which is now the city of Harare in Zimbabwe. Gripper worked as a farmer, before turning his attention towards cricket. He has one son, Trevor Gripper, who has played test and ODI cricket for Zimbabwe. Cricket career Gripper made his debut for the Rhodesian cricket team in the 1957–58 season, playing 83 first class games in the Currie Cup for the territory between 1957–58 and 1971–72. He had an unbroken run playing for the team for eight years between 1958 and 1966, when he was dropped for a game against Transvaal. He later managed to get back into the team however, and he scored his best score of 279 not out against Orange Free State in the 1967–68 season. This score was a Currie Cup record for many years. Gripper also occasionally bowled some right-arm medium pace, taking 3 wickets at an average of forty runs apiece in his first class career. He toured England with the South African Fezela XI in 1961. Administrator Following his retirement as a cricketer in the 1971–72 season citing \\"business pressures\\", Gripper became involved in the administrative side of Rhodesian, and later Zimbabwean cricket. Gripper continued to be a leading administrator within the game until the situation within Zimbabwe Cricket began to deteriorate during the Zimbabwean cricket crisis, whereupon he resigned from the board. Gripper then became a prominent critic of the direction in which cricket was heading in Zimbabwe, notably accusing Zimbabwe Cricket chairman Peter Chingoka of corruption over payments he received \\"for service to cricket for 21 years\\", as well as criticising the structure of Zimbabwe Cricket which had stripped the players and provincial associations of voting power, thus making it impossible to remove Chingoka. He also described the managing board of Zimbabwe Cricket as a group of \\"money-grabbers only in the game for what they can get out of it\\". Gripper has also been accused by some of being involved in the players strike that crippled the country's national team during the Zimbabwe Cricket Crisis. Gripper was approached by ZCU chairman Ozias Bvute in an attempt to negotiate a compromise deal with the rebel players.

Asimov's original title for the story was \\"A Hundred Million Dreams at Once\\", but F&SF; editor Anthony Boucher changed it: Asimov liked the new title and decided to keep it. Plot summary Jesse Weill is founder and owner of Dreams Inc, a company that produces dreams for the individual's private use, just as films used to be viewed, although they've been superseded by 'dreamies'. Dreamies can be viewed in private at home by anyone with the equipment and cash to buy or rent them (like present day videos or DVDs). They are produced by specially trained individuals, often social loners or eccentrics as a result of their intensive training over many years. Weill is shown a new development—under-the-counter pornographic dreamies—and asked by the government to assist in cracking down on them. Meanwhile, he interviews a ten-year-old boy as a potential dreamer, a lucrative occupation if he turns out to be suitable and undergoes training. He also gets told by one of his best dreamers that he does not want to work any more, as it is ruining family life, the dreamer also feels he has lost himself. But Weill knows from experience that the dreamer can't stop dreaming once he's become used to that way of life, even if he wants to. One of Weill's staff tells him that a competing company is opening a chain of 'dream palaces', where everyone can absorb the same dream simultaneously, but he is of the opinion that it will not work. As he says, dreaming is a private thing.

The park is situated around the Bloody Falls on the Coppermine River and was listed as a national historic site in 1978.Bloody Falls National Historic Site of Canada The park is probably best known as the site of the Bloody Falls Massacre that occurred when Samuel Hearne's Chipewyan guides massacred a group of Copper Inuit they found camped at the falls.Youth Links - The Story of Bloody Falls Short article written by three Kugluktuk students. Ethnography The area, both inside and outside the current park boundaries, was used by both Inuit and First Nations people stretching back over thousands of years. Although the park today lies outside of the modern range of the Bathurst caribou herd (named for Bathurst Inlet) the area was a major hunting ground.Bathurst Caribou - Government of the NWT Evidence, such as antler huts, show that it was used by both groups as a major barren-ground caribou hunting region.Nadlok and the Origin of the Copper Inuit at Civilization.ca The river and falls were also a major fishing area and remain so today. =Dene= Taltheilei Shale Tradition, pre-historic ancestors of the Dene, campsites about 1500 years old, may be found in the area. There is also evidence of 7000-year-old Indian campsites.New Parks North \\"Newsletter 15\\" March 2006 =Inuit= Early Paleoeskimo (Pre-Dorset culture) sites are found here and have been dated to over 3500 years. Within the last 500 years the Thule people built stone houses in the park. =Today= With the division of the Northwest Territories in 1999 the area is less used by the Dene than in previous times. Inuit from Kugluktuk still travel to the area to fish and hunt but the park is mainly a tourist attraction. The park can be reached by motorboat, about 45 minutes, all-terrain vehicle, about two hours or by a four to five hour walk. The park also provides a camping spot for canoeists travelling along the river and a special portage trail has been constructed. The campsite is situated just below the falls and is called \\"Onoagahiovik\\" in Inuinnaqtun. There are plans to build an information booth in the park and a \\"comfort station\\" is already in place. Geography The area is typical Arctic tundra and along the sides of the river are the cliffs that lead to the falls. Rocky escarpments can be found and it is possible to see the Arctic Ocean from hills within the park. The fast flowing river, normally fairly wide, is forced through the cliffs in the park and create the falls before spreading out again. Fauna In addition to herds of caribou, a visitor to the park may observe grizzly bears and wolverines. Bird species such as the golden eagle, rough-legged hawk, peregrine falcon, gyrfalcon, and swallows may be observed in the park. The last are found in large numbers and nest in the cliffs around the falls. Flora Although the park falls north of the tree line, stunted trees such as the dwarf willow do occur alongside the Coppermine River. The black-tipped groundsel (Senecio lugens) is also found in the park. The plant was named by John Richardson while travelling the river with John Franklin in 1821 during his first expedition. The word \\"lugens\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"to mourn\\" and is supposed to commemorate the massacre.

Three days later, on February 25, it sank with a group of journalists and investigators on board, killing at least one more and leaving three missing. Construction The Levina 1 was a 2,000-ton vessel built in Japan in 1980. It was owned and operated by PT Praga Jaya Sentosa. Fire On February 22, 2007, the Levina 1 was en route from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, to the island of Bangka. The vessel caught fire several hours after leaving port, prior to dawn, at a location from the start port of Tanjung Priok. Hundreds of passengers escaped the burning ship by jumping into the Java Sea. Over 290 people had to be rescued. At least 51 people were killed in the disaster, but the Indonesian Red Cross says the number of deaths could be as high as 89. The ship's log claimed the ship was carrying 228 passengers, 42 trucks and eight cars, but the navy claims it had at least 350 passengers on board. It is common for logs of passengers to be left incomplete and boats to be overloaded in Indonesia. In reference to the incomplete manifest, Transport Minister Hatta Rajasa said: \\"It is a big mistake that the ferry company never registered the identity of children passengers. It is a big, big mistake. I am going to give them heavy sanctions for that.\\" =Rescue effort= The ferry's sister ship, Levina II, rescued many passengers, as did the Filipino ship Princess Vanessa. In total, two warships (KRI Cobra and KAL Legian), three helicopters, a tug boat and nine cargo ships participated in the search and rescue operation. The injured were either transported straight to hospital, or treated at a makeshift centre set up at the port. 60 people were able to swim to a nearby island. Sinking After the fire had been extinguished, tugboat TB Jayakarta III towed the ship into the waters of Tanjung Priok on February 24. The following day, a party of four investigators and twelve journalists were taken to the ship by a police boat. The reporters came from the Indosiar, Metro TV, ANTV, Lativi (later TvOne), RCTI and SCTV TV stations and the Elshinta radio station. Many of those who boarded did not put on lifevests; although they had been available, the police had not made them mandatory. The ferry was still under tow at the time, being seven nautical miles (13 km) from the port itself. It was already listing slightly prior to the party boarding the wreck, and the group had been previously warned the ferry wasn't safe. The Indonesian investigative authority, the KNKT, had not given the group permission to board, but they saw other journalists on board, and followed suit. Once on board the hulk, the journalists went to deck three where they interviewed the head of the city's Water Police, Adj. Sr. Comr. Frederik Kalembang. Shortly after the party boarded the vessel, it suddenly listed sharply. Police officers monitoring the vessel from a nearby boat used a loudspeaker to order an immediate evacuation of the ship. Most of those on board rushed down to deck two, where they escaped via a window at the end of the deck. The ship sank within five minutes. One six-man lifeboat nearly capsized due to being heavily overloaded. One Lativi cameraman subsequently died in hospital, and three other people – two police forensics officers and a SCTV cameraman – remain unaccounted for. Four more people were seriously injured. Diving operations on the wreck failed to locate the bodies of the deceased. Investigation An investigation was launched after the twin disasters by the National Transportation Safety Committee and the Police Forensic Laboratory. The investigation established that the fire started in a truck on the car deck. It is believed to have been a chemical fire, as the ship's crew reported that when they attempted to douse the tarpaulin-covered truck with water, the ferocity of the fire increased. The trucker's ticketing agency shows that one of the trucks was loaded with cases of premixed petroleum, a rare and expensive commodity in Indonesia. The ship's captain was interviewed as part of the investigative procedure. Preliminary reports suggest that negligence on the part of the operator, PT Praga Jaya Sentosa, contributed to the disaster. The investigation revealed that no inspection of the boat's documents was conducted prior to departure. The vessel's skipper, as well as four other crew members, were also the subject of a criminal investigation regarding possible negligence. Aftermath Setyo Rahardho, head of the National Transport Safety Commission, said that \\"journalists will not be allowed to accompany investigators any more\\", in the aftermath of the disasters. Hatta Radjasa, Indonesian Minister for Transportation, personally ordered the Directorate of Sea Transportation to revoke PT Praga Jaya Sentosa's license in response to the inaccurate passenger manifests. The directorate did so, and also suspended local harbourmaster J. Karelantang over his responsibility regarding the misleading documents. The captain, Andi Kurniawan, and the first officer, Sunaryo, were arrested after the disaster and charged with negligence. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) reiterated an offer made to Indonesia in late 2006 (after over 400 people died in the sinking of Senopati Nusantara and Tri Star 1) to assist with aiding ferry safety. This time, Indonesia accepted, and the IMO made recommendations which resulted in the establishment of an action plan.

The station has been in use since the track to Savonia was built in 1889.  History  The original station building and restaurant in a 1925 postcard.In the 1880s, the village of Pieksämäki was located west to the current place of the town at Tienristi, currently known as Yläristi, and so the people of the municipality would have wanted the track to go west of Pieksänjärvi. However, because of cost reasons, in 1885 the government decided to build the track east of the lake, bringing the station a couple of kilometres east of the village, in the middle of an uninhabited swamp. The first station building was very modest. The stations were divided into five classes in order of importance, with class 1 being the most important; originally, the Pieksämäki station was of class 4. The village of Haapakoski located near Pieksämäki also received its own station, of class 5. Originally, cargo traffic was more important, and there was only passenger traffic to Mikkeli and Kuopio. Nevertheless, people started moving near the station, attracted by the railroad. The representatives of the Pieksämäki area, most importantly Aapeli Häyrinen, were strong supporters of the Savonia railway, and were also present in the discussion of a perpendicular track in the early 20th century. The track would combine the parallel tracks of Ostrobothnia, Savonia and Karelia, but there was controversy about the actual layout. When Savonlinna received a railway connection from the east in 1908, the situation was clarified, and the track between Savonlinna and Pieksämäki was built in 1914. At the same time, a side track from Huutokoski to Varkaus was built, and the Pieksämäki station became more important, of class 3. Already at this time, there was an agreement on the best western layout for the perpendicular track (the Pieksämäki station had faced competition from a track between Suonenjoki and Suolahti), and so the track was extended from Pieksämäki towards Jyväskylä, being completed by the time of Finland's independence and the Finnish Civil War in 1918. Having thus became a crossing point in the Finnish railway network, the Pieksämäki station was promoted to class 2. The completion of the perpendicular track meant a rise of importance for the Pieksämäki station, and it soon got its own restaurant. The proximity of the railroad had also resulted in another habitation centre near the station, and in the 1920s, it outgrew the old Tienristi, thus becoming the centre of the area. The separate Pieksämäki village became a market town called Pieksämä in 1930, but the Finnish Railway Institute did not rename the station. Later, the city council changed its mind, and Pieksämä was renamed back to Pieksämäki in 1948. During World War II, the important crossing point station was the target of many bombings, and the station restaurant also burned down. Nevertheless, traffic increased both during and after the war. This was partly because of a track between Varkaus and Joensuu, built in 1940. The Pieksämäki traffic control center.Pieksämäki became a central place for the VR Group, receiving a repair shop and a depot. The trackyard is one of the largest in Finland, over 6 kilometres long, with almost 100 kilometres of track. The current central traffic station at Pieksämäki was completed in 1981. Pieksämäki is the terminus for many passenger trains, and all trains passing it also stop at the station. It is nowadays a control station, because traffic control in the nearby railway traffic points are handled remotely from Pieksämäki.  Services  There is also bus traffic from the station.  In popular culture  The Pieksämäki station is a prominent element of the Juice Leskinen song \\"Bluesia Pieksämäen asemalla\\". The song is written from the perspective of a lone musician arriving to the station from Mikkeli, who then begins playing an improvised blues with accompaniment from an imaginary band to pass the time while waiting for his next train.

Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) The slaty-breasted tinamou has two sub-species: * C. b. boucardi (the nominate subspecies) ranges along the lowlands of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean coast in southeastern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and northwestern Honduras * C. b. costaricensis ranges on the Caribbean slope in Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica Philip Sclater identified the slaty-breasted tinamou from a specimen from Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1859. Etymology Crypturellus can be broken down into the following: kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning the tail and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means the small covered tail. Finally, boucardi is the Latin form of Boucard to commemorate Adolphe Boucard.Gotch, A. F. (1995) Range and habitat =Range= It is commonly found in lowland moist forest in subtropical and tropical regions up to altitude.BirdLife International (2008a) This species ranges along the Gulf of Mexico coast from southern Mexico, from southern Veracruz and northern Oaxaca south, to northern Costa Rica. Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.Clements, J (2007) =Habitat= It prefers thick evergreen forests with thick undergrowth, but also can be found in thick forests with little undergrowth, secondary forests, and on regenerating plantations. It likes moist areas as well. Description The slaty-breasted tinamou averages in length, and weighs about . Its back and head are black to chestnut in color, brown on its wings, slaty grey on its breast, white on its throat, grey-brown on remainder of its underparts with darker barring on flanks and undertail. The female has barring on its wings. Its legs are pink to bright red, and its bill is dark above and yellow below. Behavior It is a shy and difficult tinamou to be seen on the dark forest floors. Its call is a three- note call and lower than other tinamous. Its calls can be in long bouts, up to five hours at a time. This tinamou and the thicket tinamou will produce hybrids on occasion. =Feeding= Like other tinamous, it feeds on fruit and seeds and some invertebrates, in particular, ants and termites. =Reproduction= The slaty-breasted tinamou male attracts 2 to 4 females to lay in its nest on the ground and in thick vegetation or between the raised roots of a tree. The male incubates and raises the young. Females will mate with more than one male. Conservation The IUCN has classified the slaty- breasted as Least Concern and it has an occurrence range of . It is hunted for food but its numbers seem to be consistent.

It is sprayed in Chicago and many other cities. Sumithrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, is the main active ingredient. Anvil is applied aerially via fixed-wing and rotary aircraft or via ground applications (truck/ATV/backpack) using ultra-low volume (ULV) sprayers. According to the Anvil Technical Bulletin published in January 2006, these sprayers create a fine mist of drops that average 17 micrometres in size. A very small amount of active ingredient is used; about of active ingredient is used to treat (4.2 kg/km²). The active ingredients in Anvil break down quickly in sunlight and do not bioaccumulate. There are no reentry precautions for Anvil. Anvil has been tested in 43 field trials in the United States against 30 mosquito species.  History  Sumithrin was registered for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1975 and Anvil is registered for ground and aerial application in outdoor residential and recreational areas. Anvil is manufactured and distributed by Clarke Mosquito Control. Clarke Mosquito Control Anvil Page In 2003, Anvil was used to treat more than one million acres (4,000 km²) in Larimer County, Colorado during a West Nile virus outbreak. According to the Anvil Technical Bulletin, this application reduced mosquito populations by approximately 80 percent. In 2006, Anvil was used in Massachusetts after Governor Mitt Romney declared a state of emergency after the virus that causes Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was identified in large quantities in mosquito populations and again in 2019 via aerial spraying after multiple people tested positive for EEE.  Controversy  No-spray protests have called for more organic methods of preventing West Nile fever due to concerns about the potential health and environmental effects of the spray as well as recent studies showing the ineffectiveness of the spray.

The story gained greater attention and study when it was later anthologized in the 1985 edition of Norton Anthology of Literature by Women. Plot summary The story centers around its narrator, a woman named Estelle, discussing her feelings and fantasies on rape. She recounts a story about her lunch break with her co-workers, where they discuss their fantasies of rape over a card game. While her friends all have romanticized rape fantasies, Estelle breaks the trend by having humorous turns of events in her fantasies that help her thwart the rape attempt. In her stories she manages to escape rape in many ways, from having the rapist help her get lemon juice to squirt in his eyes, to helping the rapist get to the bottom of his emotional problems. Concerned that her rape fantasies are abnormal, she continues to share more and more stories, none involving an actual rape.

Each issue, consisting of the cassette itself and a short newsletter including a table of contents, contained programs, utilities, and games. Produced for users of the Commodore PET, and available by subscription only, CURSOR was a forerunner of the later disk magazines (\\"diskmags\\") that came about as floppy disk drives became common, and eventually ubiquitous, in home and personal computing during the 1980s. Ron Jeffries and Glen Fisher, of the software company The Code Works of Goleta, California, was CURSOR's publisher and editor, respectively.

The agency, headquartered at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales, is an element of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and serves both military and civilian functions. The names Australian Hydrographic Service and the Australian Hydrographic Office are commonly abbreviated as AHS or AHO respectively. Role The Australian Hydrographic Service is an element of the RAN, and serves both military and civilian functions. The headquarters of the agency is at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 172 The Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO) is the Department of Defence agency responsible for the publication and distribution of nautical charts and other information required for the safety of ships navigating in Australian waters. The AHO is also responsible for the provision of operational surveying support and maritime Military Geographic Information (MGI) for Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations and exercises. The AHO has its origins in the British Admiralty Hydrographic Office, which was established in 1795. The Admiralty carried out surveys and published charts of the Australian coast throughout the 19th century in support of the defence and commercial development of the colonies. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) assumed responsibility for hydrographic surveys in 1920, and for the publication of charts in 1942. In 1946 the Federal Cabinet made the Commonwealth Naval Board responsible for the surveying and charting of Australian waters. This responsibility was confirmed in 1988 after a review of Commonwealth mapping activities. Hydrographic services provided by the AHS include the mapping and surveying of undersea terrain and irregularities on and under the water's surface (known collectively as hydrography), the provision of nautical charts and other publications, such as tide tables and Notices to Mariners. Over 400 paper charts are produced by the AHS, with conversion of these to electronic navigational chart format due to be completed in 2011. Under international agreements, the Australian charting area spans approximately one-eighth of the world's surface, extending from Cocos Island to the west, the Solomon Islands to the east, the Equator to the north, and Antarctica to the south. History HMAS Leeuwin Fokker 27 formerly used by the service Following the work of explorers, the British Admiralty established a Chart and Chronometer Depot in Sydney in 1897.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 166 The depot was to supplement the activities of Royal Navy survey ships in Australian waters. In 1913, the depot was taken over by the Australian government and was renamed the RAN Hydrographic Depot. Despite this, survey activities were performed by Royal Navy vessels until World War I, when surveying operations were concentrated in European waters. After the war, the Admiralty decided that with higher priorities in Europe, it would provide at most a single vessel for survey operations around Australia, and the Australian government was forced to create its own hydrographic surveying service. After deliberation on whether the new hydrographic service would be military or civilian operated, the government decided that surveying would be a naval responsibility, with the RAN Hydrographic Service established on 1 October 1920. A single sloop, , was commissioned into RAN service to supplement the Royal Navy survey vessel, and was later fitted with a Fairey IIID seaplane to assist with surveys of the Great Barrier Reef.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, pp. 166–7 Geranium was replaced by , but the new survey ship was placed in reserve once the Great Barrier Reef survey was completed in 1929.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 167 By this point, no other survey operations (military or civilian) were being performed in Australian waters. Surveying operations did not resume in the region until World War II, when it became evident that Age of Sail-era charts of the South West Pacific desperately needed updating. Requesitioned auxiliary ships, later supplemented by several Bathurst class corvettes modified into survey vessels, were used to chart the waters around the East Indies and New Guinea, with the RAN designated as the charting authority responsible for supporting Allied operations in the South West Pacific Area.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, pgs. 167, 169The Australian Corvettes, p. 2 As well as updating navigational charts, RAN survey ships were also used to inspect and clear sites for amphibious landings.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 169 By the end of the war, sixteen vessels were attached to the Hydrographic Service, including the frigate and five Bathurst class corvettes.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 170 In 1946, the Australian Cabinet decided that the RAN would remain in control of all hydrographic operations in both Australian waters and areas of Australian interest. RAN warships were used to survey waters around Australia as part of a national hydrographic survey. In 1947, the Antarctic exploration ship was commissioned, but only one voyage was completed, and RAN hydrographic operations in the Antarctic were stopped in 1948. In 1963, a resource and export boom required the Hydrographic Service to change its focus from a comprehensive national survey to the charting of new ports and shipping routes suitable for deep-draught merchant ships.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 171 A purpose-built survey ship, entered service in 1964. Survey of ports and shipping routes was completed by 1974. From 1979 onwards, the Hydrographic Service began to provide hydrographic assistance and training to Pacific island nations.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 172 During 1989 and 1990, four Paluma class survey ships entered service with the RAN, followed by two larger Leeuwin class ships in 1999. In 1993, the RAN began to use Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) technology to assist in surveying: this was first fitted to a Fokker F27 aircraft, then in 2010 was installed in a De Havilland Dash 8, operated by the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight.

It has a globular rhizome with stipule-like fleshy outgrowths. The leaves are dark green, twice pinnate and up to 1 metre long. Every pinnule has up to six pairs of leaflets. The petioles are dark-purplish, hence the name 'purpurascens' meaning 'becoming purple'. The sporangia are fused in all Ptisana into a bivalvate synangium. Conservation plans have been proposed for Ptisana purpurascens, an endemic of the distant Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, where a single population remains on Green Mountain. While the mature plants are still present in large numbers, long-term threats to its survival exist in the form of competition with alien invasive species like introduced plants such as Buddleja madagascariensis and grazing by sheep and rabbits.

History After the acclaimed goth rock band Dreadful Shadows decided to split and go their separate ways, Sven and Norman collaborated with ex-Dreadful Shadows producer Thommy Hein on a project called Helix. However, since the Helix name was taken by another band, they were forced to rename themselves Zeraphine – taken from the Hebrew Bible’s concepts of the seraph (or seraphim), a class of angel in traditional Judaism and Orthodox Christianity. Once Zeraphine, the band signed onto the Drakkar Entertainment record label. Originally, additional band members Manuel Senger (guitars), Michael Nepp (bass), and Marcellus Puhlemann (drums) joined the project as studio musicians. This changed after their debut album was released, and each member began contributing music and ideas to all following releases. Zeraphine’s debut album, Kalte Sonne (2002), gained notoriety for its lyrics; unlike Dreadful Shadows, whose songs were written entirely in English, Sven elected to pen an album completely in German, citing that \\"I simply tried to transfer my style of writing to my mother tongue and I liked it quite a lot. I always thought it would be impossible.\\" Their following album, Traumaworld (2003), saw Sven return to English, with only two songs written in German. Tonally, the album’s lyrics were harsher, as the band drew inspiration from their feelings on the Iraq War. However, when it came to promoting the album, the more upbeat \\"Be My Rain\\" (2003) was chosen as the single. A music video was made for \\"Be My Rain\\" (consisting of live footage), and a limited promo CD was released, featuring album, radio, and club mixes of the title track, and a cover of the Depeche Mode song \\"In Your Room\\". In 2004, Zeraphine joined HIM on an acclaimed tour of Europe, which exposed the band to an even wider audience. In anticipation for the tour, Zeraphine hit the studio again to record the single \\"New Year's Day\\" (2004), featuring a cover version of the U2 song, and two other original tracks. Promptly after the tour finished, Zeraphine again entered the studio and churned out another single, \\"Die Macht In Dir\\" (2004), which promised a full album at the beginning of the following year. The single, as well as the title track, consisted of alternative versions of \\"Kaltes Herz\\", \\"Die Macht In Dir\\", (and on the limited edition release) \\"Until I Finally Drown\\". Blind Camera (2005) was released with a positive response by both fans and critics, and sent Zeraphine on the road once more, headlining their own trip across Europe. A particular point of well-reception was the balance in German and English lyrics – nearly half the songs on Blind Camera are written in German. The record itself was written as a semi-concept album, dealing with themes such as perception and reality. In 2006, Zeraphine announced that they were severing their ties with their label, Drakkar Entertainment, so that they could have more creative control over their next record. Still (2006), released on the Phonyx Records label (a record label managed by the band themselves, and producer Thommy Hein), was handled with noticeably less ‘polish’ than their previous albums. This was per the band’s decision to move to a less studio- oriented, more live sounding style of recording. Two editions of the album were released, a regular and an enhanced version; the enhanced featuring an additional song, and the music video (and outtakes) to the title track and single, \\"Still\\". The record’s title is meant to represent both its German and English meanings, commenting on the duality of the album’s lyrical content. The band was decidedly less active in 2007, when Sven and Norman rejoined Dreadful Shadows for live shows exclusively. Also during this time, Sven began working on a side project, an electronic solo project titled Solar Fake. A compilation album was also released during this time, titled Years in Black (2007), by Phoynx Records and Drakkar Entertainment; It contained songs from all four albums, and while no unreleased material was put on it (an update on their official website cited such an act as a ‘fan rip-off’), the currently out-of-print radio mix of \\"Be My Rain\\" was added in place of the album version. Zeraphine continued to tour and do festivals throughout 2007 and 2008, with a few new songs slipping into setlists during the later half of 2008. As of March 2009, it is rumored that the band is working on a fifth album. In the end of month Zeraphine announced that new album is complete and it is planned to be released on June 11, 2010.

The scented white, cream or occasionally pale-pink flowers are most abundant in the winter or spring but can occur sporadically throughout the year. Taxonomy The type specimen for this species was collected from King George Sound region and was described by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher in 1839 who gave it the name Manglesia vestita. In 1845 Carl Meissner put the species into the genus Grevillea. The specific epithet is vestita from the Latin word vestitus meaning \\"covered in hairs\\" =Subspecies= There are currently two recognised subspecies: *Grevillea vestita (Endl.) Meisn. subsp. vestita *Grevillea vestita subsp.isopogoides F.Muell. ex McGill. which has smaller leaves with the margins rolled under.

The dominant Eastern Orthodox church in Serbia is the Serbian Orthodox Church. Also, the Romanian Orthodox Church has its own Diocese of Dacia Felix that operates among Orthodox Romanians in Serbian Banat and the Timok Valley. History =Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages= During Late Antiquity, on the territory of present-day Serbia there were several major Christian centers and episcopal sees, including Sirmium, Singidunum, Viminacium, Naissus, Ulpiana and others. In 535, Byzantine emperor Justinian I created new Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima, centered in the city of Justiniana Prima near present-day town of Lebane in central Serbia. =Middle Ages and early Modern Period= The identity of ethnic Serbs was historically based on Orthodox Christianity; the Serbian Orthodox Church, to the extent that some people claimed that those who were not Orthodox, were not Serbs. The Christianization of the Serbian lands took place in the 9th century, and Serbia (the Serbian Principality) is accounted Christian as of 870,Vlasto 1970, p. 208 when the Eparchy of Ras and Braničevo were founded, confirmed by the Eighth Ecumenical Council (879-880).Vlasto 1970, p. 209 The Serbian bishoprics became part of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, after the Byzantine conquest of the Bulgarian Empire in 1018.

The Serbian Orthodox Church was given autocephaly in 1219, when Archbishop Sava received recognition from the exiled Ecumenical Patriarch. In 1346, it was raised to the rank of Patriarchate.

Description The Choco tinamou is approximately in length. It is a small, plain dark tinamou. Its upperparts are dark brown, with blackish crown, slate-grey sides of neck, whitish throat and indistinct dusky barring. Its legs are red. The females are darker with coarser barring on wing-coverts and breast, and grey flanks.BirdLife International (2008) Behavior It has a low, faint, mournful, three-note whistle voice. Like other tinamous, the Choco tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Taxonomy The Choco tinamou is a monotypic species.Clements, J (2007) All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Range This species is found in northwestern Chocó Department Colombia, and southern Darién Department PanamaClements, J (2007) Habitat The Choco tinamou resides in tropical and sub-tropical moist evergreen forests both lowland and montane up to altitude. However, it seems that it prefers higher elevations. =Threats= The Choco tinamou is currently threatened by the vast destruction of its habitats caused by road construction, human settlement, timber extraction and mining. The completion of a new road-bridge has made unprotected areas of coastal plain forest adjacent to the Ensenada de Utría National Park accessible to settlement and further threatens its habitats. The population at Atrato valley, Colombia, would probably be the most threatened caused by human settlement, and conversion to farmland and banana plantations. It is presumably hunted wherever humans are present. The completion of the Pan- American highway through Darién and the canalisation of the Truandó and lower Atrato Rivers, to make an inter-oceanic fairway, are currently on hold, but could have serious effects on the species if it is to be completed. The biggest threats are hunting, and the on-hold transportation plans. =Conservation measures= The Choco tinamou is currently protected in Darién National Park, Panama, and Ensenada de Utría National Park, Colombia. Los Katíos National Park, Colombia, also protects of apparently suitable habitat in the Chocó region, but the species has yet to be recorded in the reserve. It was proposed to survey areas and study the ecology to provide an improved understanding of its status and distribution. The status of Choco tinamou is considered as Vulnerable because it is known from only a few locations within its small range where habitat is gradually disappearing. It has an occurrence range of , with a 2000 estimate of less than 10,000 adult birds (1500-5000 low end estimate).

A natural right-hander, by 1986 he could throw well enough left- handed that he felt capable of pitching with either arm in a game. Harris did not throw left-handed in a regular-season game until September 28, 1995, the penultimate game of his career. Pitching for the Montreal Expos against the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth inning, Harris retired Reggie Sanders pitching right-handed, then switched to his left hand for the next two hitters, Hal Morris and Eddie Taubensee, who were both left-handed batters. Harris walked Morris but got Taubensee to ground out. He then went back to his right hand to retire Bret Boone to end the inning. Venditte pitching right-handed for the Staten Island Yankees, Short-Season A affiliates of the New York Yankees, in Pat Venditte regularly pitches with both arms. Venditte was drafted by the New York Yankees, played for the Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and now plays for the Miami Marlins. While with the Staten Island Yankees, the Yankees' Single-A affiliate, when he opposed switch hitter Ralph Henriquez, Venditte switched his modified glove to his left arm. (Hitters traditionally derive advantages from batting from the opposite side of the plate to the pitcher's throwing arm.) Henriquez then switched to batting left-handed, and a series of changes continued for several minutes. This prompted the PBUC (Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation) to issue a new rule about switch- pitching. In short, switch-pitchers must indicate to the umpire, batter, and any runners the hand with which they will use to pitch. The pitcher must continue using this hand for the duration of the at bat, with some exceptions for injury and the use of pinch hitters. Following this choice, batters can then select with which hand they will bat. Right-handed pitcher Yu Darvish throws with his left hand when training. He does this to keep both arms strong and balanced. He does not pitch left-handed during a game, however. In 2003, the Atlanta Braves drafted switch pitcher Brandon Berdoll of Temple (Texas) Junior College in the 27th round. He never made it to the major leagues. In the collegiate ranks, Matt Brunnig (Harvard class of 2006–07) was able to pitch over 85 mph left-handed and over 90 mph right-handed, but only pitched with both arms in the same game a few times. In college, he pitched more from the right side as a starter and pitched some relief as a lefty although he did start one game left-handed. When playing the outfield after a start he would typically play the position with the other arm to rest the arm he just pitched with. Switch-throwers are commonly taught to switch-throw at a young age. For instance, Venditte's father trained him in ambidextrous throwing from the age of three and Brunnig's father taught him from age five.

Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a serviceman could not file a tort action against the federal government even though the government secretly administered doses of LSD to him as part of an experimental program, because his injuries were found by the lower court to be service-related.  Background  In February 1958, James B. Stanley, a master sergeant in the Army stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, volunteered for a chemical warfare testing program. Stanley was administered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in a US Army plan to test the effects of the drug on human subjects. Stanley claimed he was unknowingly given the drug. Stanley claimed that as a result of the LSD exposure, he suffered from hallucinations, periods of incoherence, and memory loss due to his unawareness of having taken the drug. He suffered severe personality changes that led to his discharge and the dissolution of his marriage. Stanley filed a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) alleging negligence in the administration, supervision, and subsequent monitoring of the experimental program. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the serviceman could assert his claims under the FTCA and refused to dismiss the serviceman's Bivens claims.  Opinion of the Court  After granting certiorari, the Supreme Court held that the circuit court had no jurisdiction to give orders to dismiss FTCA claims. The Supreme Court also held there was no Bivens claim for the serviceman's injuries because the lower court ruled the injuries occurred during Stanley's military service.  Aftermath  In 1994 Congress passed a private claims bill to redress the case. In 1996 an arbitration panel awarded Stanley $400,577 (the maximum amount allowed under the bill) after a 2-1 vote.Bob Erlandson, Ex-sergeant compensated for LSD experiments Tests by Army, CIA done at Edgewood, March 07, 1996, Baltimore Sun  References   External links  Tom Bowman, Former sergeant seeks compensation for LSD testing at Edgewood Arsenal, July 11, 1991, Baltimore Sun * Oral history interview with James Stanley United States Supreme Court cases 1987 in United States case law Implied constitutional cause of action case law United States federal sovereign immunity case law United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court ","title":"United States v.

It moved into its present location at 6 Divinity Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1903. Description From the beginning, HMANE was the home of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, a departmental library, a repository for research collections, a public educational institute, and a center for archaeological exploration. Among the museum's early achievements were the first scientific excavations in the Holy Land (at Samaria in 1907–1912) and excavations at Nuzi and Tell el- Khaleifeh in the Sinai, where the earliest alphabet was found. The museum's artifacts include pottery, cylinder seals, sculpture, coins, cuneiform tablets, and Egyptian mummy sarcophagi. Many are from museum-sponsored excavations in Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Cyprus, Israel, and Tunisia. The museum holds plaster casts of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, the Laws of Hammurabi, and the Stele of Esarhaddon, as well as a full-scale model of an Iron Age Israelite house. The museum is dedicated to the use of these collections for the teaching, research, and publication of Near Eastern archaeology, history, and culture. History The original name is carved above the entrance Architectural firm A. W. Longfellow broke ground on the present HMANE site on September 27, 1900. Construction was completed in spring of 1902, and the public portions of the museum were opened on February 5, 1903. The museum's facilities were repurposed during World War II, and it was closed to the public from August 1942 through April 1946. Twelve years later it was closed again to the public, lasting from 1958 through 1982. On October 14, 1970, a bomb was detonated on the third floor of the museum, which at that time housed the Center for International Affairs. The museum reopened in April 1982, and then Harvard President Derek Bok spoke at the reopening ceremony. In December 2012, Harvard announced a new consortium, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, whose members were the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Harvard Semitic Museum, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. In April 2020, Peter Der Manuelian, director of the museum, announced changing its name to the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East (HMANE), explaining that \\"The change is not a reaction to any particular event, but rather our attempt to reflect our core mission in clearer terms.\\" He also announced a \\"virtual tour\\" of the museum's galleries, allowing visitors to view many artifacts in detail, even as the physical museum was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Functions =Exhibition and education= The museum (through the collaborative efforts of departmental faculty, curators, museum curatorial staff, and students) mounts exhibits, often in conjunction with university courses, which serve the university community and also attract the general public. The museum has an active public outreach program featuring tours for school groups and teacher training workshops. The museum also sponsors, either alone or in conjunction with other institutions, a number of public lectures each year. Through these educational efforts, the museum seeks to promote a wider understanding of the civilizations of the Near East and their great cultural legacies. =Teaching with the collection= The museum encourages Harvard University students and faculty to make use of the museum collections and facilities. Objects can be used for coursework, viewing assignments, research papers, senior theses, dissertations, and teaching displays. The basement seminar room is available for sections scheduled to view the collection. =Research and publication= The museum sponsors archaeological field research into the complex societies of the Near East, with special emphasis on those ancient cultures related to the world of the Bible. Each year more than 100 staff, students, and volunteers participate in the Ashkelon Excavations (The Leon Levy Expedition), led by Honorary Museum Director Lawrence E. Stager, Dr. Daniel M. Master, and Dr. Adam Aja. The museum, through its Harvard Semitic Series and Harvard Semitic Monographs, publishes archaeological, historical, philological, and cultural studies of the Near East, many of which present the research of the department faculty and their students.

The company produced over 20 multi-media live performances over a span of 25 years, winning a multitude of awards for its international performances, earning critical acclaim in Asia, Europe and South America and gaining North American attention at Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. In the 1990s, he was the first to merge live performers within stage environments created by computer generated graphics in real time live theatre. Coates became known as a pioneer of experimental live theatre using stereographic projections and 3-D glasses populated by live actors and musicians. Early life George Coates was born in Philadelphia in 1952 and spent his childhood in New Jersey and later Rhode Island. His father was an Irish Catholic rotogravure operator at the Providence Journal. In 1969, at the age of 17, Coates hitched a ride to California and eventually settled in Berkeley. Coates auditioned for and was cast in numerous productions at the University of California, Berkeley theater department as an unregistered student. He then traveled to New York where he signed a year contract with the National Shakespeare Company, touring the country in character roles in \\"As You Like It,\\" \\"Julius Caesar\\" and George Bernard Shaw's \\"St. Joan.\\" When the contract ended, Coates returned to Berkeley, where he joined the Berkeley Stage Company and later the experimental theater group the Blake Street Hawkeyes, where he became fascinated by improvisation and the ensemble. Early work In 1976, Coates began creating original works with performers including movement artists, opera and gospel singers presented non-traditional formats in a theatrical context. His first major piece, 2019 Blake, was the story of a performer who can't keep a linear train of thought, performed by mime Leonard Pitt with a few props. His next one-man show, Duykers The First, featured operatic tenor John Duykers. The Way of How, performed at Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival in 1983, included the same performers, operatic tenor Rinde Eckhert, and a real time analog sound processing system invented by composer Paul Dresher that created the sound of an ensemble playing when a performer laid down multiple tracks on a tape loop. Notable work Coates' Rare Area was seen by 35,000 people in a sold-out, three-month run at San Francisco's Theater Artaud and in a one-month series at the Museum of Modern Arts' Herbst Theater. Commissioned in 1986 by William Cook and \\"American Inroads\\" for their San Francisco New Performance Festival, Actual Sho was created through eight months of improvisation, utilized an original design of a tilting, rolling stage. Actual Sho premiered in Stuttgart, West Germany on June 25, 1987 before its inclusion in the 1987 New Performance Festival. It was performed in Yugoslavia, Poland, the Kennedy Center's San Francisco Festival in Washington, DC, the Pepsico Summerfare Festival in Purchase, NY, the BITEF Festival in Belgrade and Herbst Theater in San Francisco. Coates collaborated with Steve Jobs in 1988 to create a multimedia production for the unveiling of Jobs' NeXT Computer System and was featured for this production in the 2015 film, Steve Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Coates' Right Mind opened the American Conservatory Theater's 1989-1990 season. It was brought to a close October 17, 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake caused extensive damage to the landmark Geary Theater, with the set for Right Mind on stage. A year to the day after the earthquake, Coates’ show Architecture of Catastrophic Change opened in his new theater, a renovated neo-gothic cathedral at 110 McAllister St. in San Francisco. In 1999, Coates became the first to acquire the rights to Valerie Solanas' long-lost work Up Your Ass, which had been lost by Andy Warhol (for which Solanas shot him) and discovered at the Andy Warhol Museum thirty years later. The production, which was retitled Up Your A$$ by Coates and made its world premiere in 2000 at his San Francisco theater, was regarded one of the raunchiest and most controversial shows around, with an all-female cast, many of which were dressed in drag. The play was mounted on alternate nights with a production of Arthur Miller's The Archbishop's Ceiling, for which Coates had received funding from National Endowment for the Arts, to make a production examining censorship. Coates' production of the Miller play incorporated gender bending by including five of the performers from Up Your A$$, some in drag, some not. Up Your A$$ later premiered in New York at PS 122. Recent Activity From 2004-2011, Coates ran an online video blog, Better Bad News, a scripted video series with a cast of performers. He has hosted Twit Wit Radio, a weekly political satire program with a cast of actors, on Pacifica Radio, KPFA 94.1 FM, since 2011. Influences George Coates cited the participatory scientific displays of Frank Oppenheimer as a major influence. The brother of Robert J. Oppenheimer, Frank founded the Exploratorium, San Francisco's hands- on, interactive people's science museum.

They are small to intermediately large ferns with erect or creeping rhizomes and usually once-pinnate leaves with opposite pinnae. The fertile leaves are contracted, acrostichoid and covered below with sunken, linear synangia. The genus Danaea has a neotropical distribution, occurring from southern Mexico through Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America to Bolivia, Paraguay and the Mata Atlantica in Brazil and Northern Argentina. There is also a population on Isla del Coco (Cocos Island) in the Pacific. Two species Danaea carillensis (Costa Rica) and D. simplicifolia (Guianas, Brazil, Trinidad) have simple, undivided leaves, and some other species sometimes have bipinnate leaves (D. atlantica, D. bipinnata, D. nodosa, D. urbanii). One species Danaea kalevala of the Lesser Antilles was named in honour of the Finnish heroic epic Kalevala. The basal chromosome number for this genus is 2n=80. The type species is Danaea nodosa. Taxonomy Danaea is the basal lineage in the Marattiaceae and the oldest fossils are from the Paleocene, a period where rainforests became more abundant. It has radiated in these early rainforests and presently counts about 50 species in 3 sections: sect. Danaea, sect. Arthrodanaea and sect.

Its landscaped grounds include three artificial lakes, one of which conceals a remarkable underwater conservatory and smoking room. Statue of Neptune on an island at Witley Park In 1890, the noted swindler Whitaker Wright purchased Lea Park, and the adjacent South Park Farm, from the Earl of Derby. The title to the estate included the titular Lordship of the Manor and control of Hindhead Common and the Devil's Punch Bowl. He then developed it as part of an extensive set of real estate holdings, approximately , that he purchased in the Haslemere and Hindhead area. Wright developed the pre-existing house into a 32-bedroom mansion adjacent to one of three artificial lakes, and within the landscaped grounds. Underneath an adjacent lake\\"Whittaker Wright: His Home at Lea\\", West Gippsland [Victoria, BC] Gazette, 11 August 1903 Wright built an underwater conservatory and smoking room, with aquarium windows, upon which a statue of Neptune stands, giving the appearance it is floating on the water. After Wright committed suicide upon conviction for fraud, his properties were auctioned off. Much of Hindhead Common, Witley Common and Thursley Common was passed on to the National Trust. The remnants of Lea Park were sold to William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, notable for his role in the building of RMS Titanic. The letter P with a crown above can be seen on metal gates in the estate and previously-owned lands. The 32-bedroom mansion burned down in 1952. The estate was renamed from Lea Park to Witley Park by the Leigh family, later owners, perhaps to avoid the confusion with Lea/Leigh. Witley Park House, a Modern movement home designed by Patrick Gwynne,RIBA photographs was built elsewhere on the estate in 1961. The landscaped park remained. In 1982 the estate, now comprising some 1,300 acres, was purchased by Sir Raymond and Lady Brown. In 2002 the Brown family sold the 450 acres of walled-off Parkland, Gate Lodges and Cottages, retaining Witley Park Farm to the south. Permission for a new house on the site of the old mansion was granted around 2004 and is now completed.

It is located directly adjacent to Interstate 5 at milepost 742 between the city of Mount Shasta and Weed, California. The highway crosses a pass, Black Butte Summit, at the western base of the lava domes. The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of Shastina following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000–10,000 years ago. A United States Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in the early 1930s, but destroyed during the Columbus Day Storm of 1962. A new lookout was built in 1963 and operated until 1973. The building was moved by helicopter to a new location in 1975 and only the concrete foundation remains today. A trail leads to the summit from a trailhead accessible by gravel roads off the Everitt Memorial Highway.

The Shundahai Network plays a key role in organizing non-violent civil disobedience aimed at bringing about the closure of the Nevada Test Site, used for testing nuclear weapons, which is located on Western Shoshone land.Shundahai Network - Who We Are Yucca Flats Nevadaalt=  Early life  Harney's formal education ended when he ran away from Indian boarding school at the age of nine. He felt that his schoolmates were mistreated by their teachers Beginning in 1957, he worked with medicine women of Battle Mountain, Nevada, running the Sundance Ceremony and sweat lodges as well as helping sick people. As a medicine person, he also worked steadily to preserve and protect the sacred sites and burial grounds of his people. He was raised to view all life as sacred. Work and activism Harney devoted his life to working to save the land on which his people have survived for thousands of years. The United States Government has exploded more than 1,000 nuclear weapons at the Nevada Test Site, which is located on Western Shoshone land from the Treaty of Ruby Valley (1863). Harney spent most of his time travelling around the world spreading a message about the dangers of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons . In 1989, Harney visited the former Soviet hydrogen bomb testing site in Semipalatinsk Kazakhstan. He reported that he saw victims of the radiation in hospitals that he visited, people who lived close to the Russian nuclear test site. Harney talked about the contamination of water in his writings and speeches. He said:\\" I didn't really understand what I was told until I went to Kazakhstan in Russia Kazakhstan is where Russia tested hydrogen bombs for many years. Over there I saw water that looks like clean water, but people can't drink it because it is contaminated with radiation ... [t]he nature put all the living things here for us to take care of, not to destroy them.\\" In 1994 he founded the Shundahai Network (\\"shundahai\\" translates to \\"peace and harmony with all creation\\") Shundahai.org where he remained as board chair until his death. In 2003 received the International Nuclear Free Future Solutions award. Harney's experiences with victims of the nuclear weapons testing, particularly the \\"Downwinders\\" of the Western United States, gave credibility to his words. Downwinders refers to the US citizens that were downwind from the atomic bomb tests in Nevada. Harney was a keynote speaker at the Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Conference in 2001, in Nagasaki, Japan, where he was able to speak with still- recovering survivors of the testing (in the Marshall Islands, and other South Pacific atolls) or use (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) of nuclear weapons. He was also the founder and director of Poo Ha Bah,Poo-Ha-Bah a traditional healing center in Tecopa, California. > \\"I have established Poo-Ha-Bah for all the people. Poo-Ha-Bah in my language > is a very important word--it's talking about Doctor Water. My people have > always traveled for many miles to get into different kinds of healing > waters.\\" Trained from childhood in the traditional Newe ways of medicine and spirituality (the two are not viewed separately), Harney noted the extinction of medicinal plants due to the toxins of mining, and the disappearance of many birds and other animals that once roamed the Newe homelands. Harney completed arrangements for the publication of his second book, \\"The Nature Way\\", shortly before his death. In this book he shares the traditional knowledge of his people, the Newe.

Symptoms and causes Moon face is often associated with Cushing's syndrome or steroid treatment (especially corticosteroids), which has led to it being known as Cushingoid facies. Moon face is a type of corticosteroid- induced lipodystrophy along with \\"buffalo hump\\", which in one study occurred in 47% of the 820 patients. Moon face is among the most frequently reported adverse events of systemic glucocorticoids, along with insomnia (58%), mood disturbances (50%), and hyperphagia (49%). Another long-term study of 88 patients on prednisone showed that lipodystrophy, such as moon face, was the most frequent adverse event, suffered by 63% of patients.  Incidence  The risk for moon face increases with higher doses and longer time on steroid treatment. One study showed an increased risk in women, those younger than 50 years of age, and those with a high initial BMI.  Complications  This change in facial appearance can be very distressing to patients taking steroids. Later studies of the 88 patients showed that those who suffered lipodystrophy had a greater risk for metabolic syndrome characteristics such as increased blood pressure, higher plasma concentrations of fasting glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, along with lower HDL-cholesterol.  Treatment  Cessation of steroid therapy or treatment of the cause of Cushing's syndrome causes moon face to slowly decrease and eventually vanish. One study proposed that limiting calories could decrease the risk of corticosteroid-induced lipodystrophy.

Biography Mary Bateman was born to a farmer in Asenby, North Yorkshire in 1768. She became a servant girl in Thirsk, North Yorkshire but was eventually released due to petty theft. During the 1780s, she became a minor thief and con artist who often convinced many of her victims she possessed supernatural powers. By the end of the century, she had become a prominent fortuneteller in Leeds who prescribed potions which she claimed would ward off evil spirits as well as acting as medicine. In 1806 she created the hoax known as The Prophet Hen of Leeds, in which eggs laid by a hen were purported to predict the end times. Villagers believed doomsday had come when a hen began laying eggs with the phrase \\"Christ is coming\\" on each one, but it was later found to be a hoax perpetrated by Bateman, who had written on the eggs using acid and reinserted them into the hen's oviduct. She is reported to have once roamed the streets of Leeds after a major fire begging for money and goods for victims, but instead retained the charitable gifts for herself. Also in 1806, Bateman was approached by William and Rebecca Perigo who believed they had been put under a spell after Rebecca had complained of chest pains and asked for her help in lifting the curse. However, over the next several months, Bateman began feeding them pudding which was laced with poison. While Rebecca regularly ate the pudding, her husband was unable to eat more than a spoonful. Rebecca's condition worsened however and she finally died in May 1806. William Perigo continued to pay her for more than two years until he discovered one of the \\"charms\\" which he and his wife had received from Bateman was worthless paper; he went to the authorities who arrested Bateman the following day after William lured her to a meeting. Although she proclaimed her innocence, a search of her home turned up poison as well as many personal belongings of her victims including the Perigo couple. =Trial and execution= Bateman's trial took place in York in March 1809. The trial lasted eleven hours, though the jury took only a few moments to find her guilty of the charges of fraud and the murder of Rebecca Perigo. Immediately following the sentence of death from the judge, Bateman claimed that she was 22-weeks pregnant and thus unable to be hanged. The judge subsequently requested that the Sherriff gather a panel of 'matrons' to assess Bateman's claim. Twelve married women were sworn into the jury and conducted a physical examination of Bateman, concluding that she was not pregnant and thus able to be executed. William Knipe's 1867 account suggests that Bateman was married and had a daughter at home as well as an infant child in the prison with her. She supposedly mailed her wedding ring back to her husband to give to the daughter. She was hanged alongside two men on Monday 20 March 1809. After her execution, her body was put on public display in Leeds and strips of her skin were tanned into leather and sold as magic charms to ward off evil spirits. Legacy Former residence of Bateman in Leeds; this has since been converted into a public house Bateman's skeleton was on display to the public at the Thackray Medical Museum in LeedsGoor, K.

It is the only festival devoted to professional appraisal of domestic Russian animation. The festival takes place in late winter or early spring (in 2007 it was on the first five days of March) and accepts only animated films from the Russian Federation and (after a 1999 referendum) from Belarus made in the last three years. Alongside the in-contest and general film screenings, the festival organizes round-table talk sessions, press conferences, master classes and presentations. History The festival was first held in 1996 at a boarding house called \\"Birch Grove\\" near the town of Tarusa. Because of the extreme scarcity of Russian animation in the post-perestroika era, submissions from the last three years were accepted. Along with auteur films, commercial reels, video clips and television bumpers were allowed. The prizes were handed out according to profession, and any member or guest of the festival was able to vote for their favourite film. The three leading winners were given wooden planks hewn by founder and president Aleksandr Tatarskiy and signed by their colleagues. In addition to the festival, the location offered fresh air, skiing, and nearby historic sites. The festival in general was noted for its laid-back nature and served as a gathering for animators who otherwise had few opportunities to see each other in an era after the break-up of Soyuzmultfilm. Andrey Khrzhanovskiy says that it was a partial replacement for the Soviet tradition of having yearly screenings and discussions of all films from all studios at the Cinematographer's Union (which was open to the best film critics of the country). The tradition stopped in the 1990s, leaving all studios (animation studios included) with no way to connect. For the first number of years, the festival did not have an official name and was known simply as \\"Tarusoy\\" (Тарусой). In 2002, the festival changed its location to Suzdal's tourist centre, where it is held to this day. The jury situation also changed, and since 2006 films have been judged by a panel of 33 respected Russian animation professionals representing many varied professions in the art. 2008 was the first festival held after the death of Aleksandr Tatarskiy, who had headed all the previous festivals. The artistic director in his place was Aleksandr Gerasimov. Prizes Historically, the prizes have varied in different years; on some years the jury decided to not give out a Grand Prix and other years featured specific awards tailor-made to the films which were in the competition. In 2007, the prizes were: Grand Prix (also 2nd and 3rd place), Best Direction, Best Dramaturgy, Best Visuals, Best Animation, Best Sound, Best Student Film, Best Interstitial Animation and Best Film for Children. Additionally, before 2009, the festival allowed internet users of Rambler Vision to see the films first and vote for their favourites.

He worked for the Flanders Festival from 1968 to 1972. His first major administrative post was as the general director of La Monnaie (De Munt) in Brussels from 1981 to 1991, where he was credited with artistically rejuvenating the company. He subsequently held the general directorship of the Salzburg Festival from 1991 to 2001. Mortier was the founding director of the Ruhrtriennale arts festival in Germany, leading it from 2002 to 2004. He was inspired to \\"a social and artistic experiment: how to attract new audiences to the classics and galvanize a depressed corner of Germany.\\" At the same time, he was able to work his own interests in flouting tradition and attracting new audiences to the Ruhr. He put intimate productions into expansive, renovated industrial spaces. In 2003, he offered an ambitious season of > 23 productions with 129 performances in 15 spaces, along with additional > concerts, a fringe festival and what promises to be an astonishing > installation of a Bill Viola video spectacle, Five Angels for the > Millennium, inside a mighty, gorgeously restored gas tank in Oberhausen. Planned was a production of Messiaen's Saint François d'Assise in September 2003. Mortier had a \\"current of spirituality meant to infuse these cathedrals of industry\\", and emphasized a French subtext in 2003, compared to a German one the year before. He had \\"faith that audiences will eventually respond to the experimentation by him and his successors.\\" Mortier served as general director of the Opéra National de Paris from 2004 to 2009. In February 2007, the New York City Opera (NYCO) named him their next general director, effective as of the 2009/2010 season. Mortier assisted with company operations from Paris during the interim period after his appointment was announced. Problems with fund-raising and a smaller-than-expected budget began to develop during the interim period after his appointment. In addition, Mortier was campaigning for a position as co-artistic director of the Bayreuth Festival. In November 2008, Mortier resigned when it became clear that the board would not give him the money needed to produce a meaningful slate of opera productions. Also in November 2008, Mortier accepted the position of Artistic Director of the Teatro Real in Madrid. While in New York, he had already commissioned a new opera, Brokeback Mountain, with the American composer Charles Wuorinen and a libretto by Annie Proulx, who wrote the original short story on which it is based. This was one of the projects Mortier took with him to the Teatro Real, and it was completed in 2012. In September 2013, Mortier disclosed publicly his condition of cancer. During the search for his successor, he made controversial comments that he did not know of a fully qualified Spanish candidate to succeed him, and mentioned concerns about the expressed government interference in the choice of successor and their wish to have only a Spanish candidate succeed him. Later that month, following the appointment of Joan Matabosch as the company next's artistic director, Mortier was named artistic advisor of the company. On January 28, 2014, Brokeback Mountain premiered in Madrid. The production had been highly anticipated in the international season, and it was considered also a tribute to Mortier, \\"and a testament to his tireless support of the artists who work with him.\\" Mortier died of pancreatic cancer in Brussels on 8 March 2014, aged 70. Survivors include his sister Rita and his longtime companion, conductor Sylvain Cambreling. In April 2014, Mortier was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award in the International Opera Awards 2014.

Former Logo from 2012 to June 2020 =Early Years= WDBO is Orlando's oldest radio station, signing on the air on May 24, 1924. It was first licensed to Rollins College in Winter Park, FL. In its early years, it used a number of frequencies, but by 1933, it settled on 580 kilocycles.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 28. In 1935, it got a boost in power from 250 watts to 1,000 watts. It was owned by the Orlando Broadcasting Company, and was a network affiliate of CBS Radio. WDBO carried the CBS line up of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In 1949, WDBO-FM (92.3) was added. Five years later, WDBO would sign on WDBO-TV, the first television station in Central Florida. In 1982, the firm that owned WDBO-AM-FM-TV, The Outlet Company, sold the radio stations to Katz Broadcasting. (The TV station eventually became WKMG-TV.) When the stations were sold, WDBO-FM was re-formatted as a country music station, K92FM, with the call sign WWKA. =Middle of the Road to Talk= As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WDBO switched to a full service middle of the road format of popular adult music, news and sports. By the 1980s, 58 WDBO began to scale back on MOR music. It joined the ABC News Radio Network, and slowly added more talk radio programs. By the 1990s, it had become NewsTalk 580 WDBO, which for years has been Greater Orlando's highest-rated AM news/talk station. In 1997, WDBO and WWKA were acquired by Cox Radio.Broadcasting & Cable 2000 page D-98 In August 2011, Cox ended the classic rock format on WHTQ, and gave it the call sign WDBO-FM, becoming a simulcast of WDBO (AM). (WDBO was initially heard on that station's HD-2 subchannel beginning in late February 2008.) The news/talk station eventually re-branded, using the FM frequency, NewsTalk 96-5 WDBO. =Switch to Sports= On November 12, 2012, WDBO-AM-FM would split from the simulcast, when WDBO-AM re-launched as a sports radio station affiliated with ESPN Radio, while WDBO-FM continued the news/talk programming on its own. The ESPN Radio Network had been dropped previously by WHOO, which switched its affiliation to NBC Sports Radio. WDBO carried the full ESPN Radio schedule, except for a local program weekday afternoons hosted by Scott Anez.http://www.coxmediagroup.com/news/cmg-press-releases/espn-radio-returns- orlando-debuts-nov-12/nSYbh/ WDBO-AM remained the flagship radio station of the Orlando Magic basketball team until WYGM became the home of the Orlando Magic at the start of the 2018–2019 season. =Return to Talk= On June 24, 2020, Cox Radio announced that WDBO-AM would drop its sports programming to return to news/talk; in addition, WDBO-FM flipped to a Spanish-language Contemporary hits format. To give listeners in Orlando and its adjacent communities the option to hear WDBO programming on FM, Cox added an FM translator; on June 29, 107.3 W297BB began simulcasting WDBO-AM. With the addition of the translator, the station rebranded as \\"WDBO 107.3 FM and 580 AM.\\" Programming Weekdays begin with Orlando's Morning News with Joe Kelley.

The length and art of each story is different, but all these short stories are about people who came from Mainland China to Taiwan in the 1950s, and about their life in Taipei. Some of the stories were also published in Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream (1968).  Context  \\"Taipei People\\" is the iconic literary work reflecting the experience of people from Mainland China (\\"mainlanders\\", waishengren) who fled to Taiwan following the War of Resistance against Japan and the Chinese Civil War and founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.  Structure and Format  The format and topic of this book is often compared to James Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\". Both of the books are short story series, and they are all about people in a certain city. Also, another book of Pai Hsien-yung called \\"New Yorkers\\" are similar to the two books.  Themes  Although these people are called \\"Taipei People\\", in their minds they are always reminiscing the scintillating old times in Mainland China, therefore most of them don't really belong to Taipei mentally. Their loss and their sense of insecurity is what this book is depicting.  Motifs  The stories are interwoven with a large number of motifs that are very suggestive of the place, the time, and the people. Some of them include dance halls, teahouses, taxi dancer, and (sexual) patronage; mahjong; the Kuomintang military, especially the officer corps; China's diverse regions; fashion, especially the chipao (qipao); traditional Chinese interior furnishings; Buddhism; Peking opera; separation; and many others.  Related works  The collection has been translated into English and other languages. The stories have been also reworked to dramas in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and a movie in Taiwan.  Short stories synopses  \\"Taipei People\\" consists of fourteen stories: * The Eternal Snow Beauty (永遠的尹雪豔) * A Touch of Green (一把青) * New Year's Eve (歲除) * The Last Night of Taipan Chin (金大班的最後一夜) * A Sea of Blood-red Azaleas (那片血一般紅的杜鵑花) * Ode to Bygone Days (思舊賦) * The Dirge of Liang Fu (梁父吟) * Love's Lone Flower (孤戀花) * Glory's by Blossom Bridge (花橋榮記) * Autumn Reveries (秋思) * A Sky Full of Bright, Twinkling Stars (滿天裏亮晶晶的星星) * Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream (遊園驚夢) * Winter Night (冬夜) * State Funeral (國葬) Brief synopses are provided below. (Based on the English translation by the author and Patia Yasin, published as \\"Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream.\\") =The Eternal Snow Beauty (永遠的尹雪豔)= The aging \\"Snow Beauty\\" (Yin Hsueh-yen) looks back on her days as the belle of Shanghai's Paramount ballroom; she is still the center of attention at upscale mahjong soirees she arranges at her Taipei home. =A Touch of Green (一把青)= In an extended tale, the (female) narrator observes how an innocent middle school bride (Verdancy Chu) transcends the death of her air force pilot husband during the war years to attain some degree of stability in the post-war Taiwan environment. The story touches on the KMT-related New Life Movement as an element of continuity in the social life of mainland loyalists in the pre- and post-war eras. =New Year's Eve (歲除)= A visit by a former commanding officer (Brother Lai) for some New Year's Eve dining and drinking provides a contrast between the heroic tales of past military exploits and the limitations of his current situation. An important \\"character\\" in the story is the fiery Kaoliang wine, famous in Taiwan for its power. =The Last Night of Taipan Chin (金大班的最後一夜)= \\"Taipan Chin\\" is actually a woman who commands a taxi dancer group. In the story, she reflects on her choices, especially the insurmountable contradictions between wealth/security vs. love vs. freedom. =A Sea of Blood-red Azaleas (那片血一般紅的杜鵑花)= A servant, Wang Hsiung, epitomizes the torment of exile. The story is pervaded with \\"fish out of water\\" symbolism. The story leans heavily on the use of the azalea as a symbol of homesickness and exile in Chinese culture. =Ode to Bygone Days (思舊賦)= Two old servants meet and talk about all the changes around them, especially those occurring in the rich family they have served. The story views decay as seen from beneath. The story falls in a genre that explores the equivalence of the \\"mansion\\" and the \\"family,\\" and the interweaving threads in their parallel growth and decline, in (modern) Chinese literature. See, for instance, Ba Jin's Family and the classic of late imperial Chinese literature, Dream of the Red Chamber. =The Dirge of Liang Fu (梁父吟)= On the occasion of the funeral of a general, one of his cohorts recounts past exploits. The story conveys the utter resolution of substantial elements of the elite mainlander class to \\"recover the Mainland,\\" even as age and distance render their desires impossible. The story includes a recounting of events connected to the Wuchang Uprising, the first event in the 1911 Revolution that gave birth to the Republic of China. \\"The Dirge of Liang Fu\\" refers to specific compositions in classic Chinese literature, and suggests the way in which exile and return have been the subject of Chinese poets such as Tu Fu. =Love's Lone Flower (孤戀花)= \\"Peach Blossom\\" is the protégé and companion of the female protagonist; both are club escorts. Peach Blossom becomes falls into a deadly and insanity-creating spiral with a thug, Yama. The context of the story is yet another variant of the Chinese \\"pleasure quarters,\\" the winehouse. =Glory's by Blossom Bridge (花橋榮記)= \\"Glory's\\" is a restaurant, and the noodles it serves could stand as a tenuous link between distant Kweilin—the site of its predecessor—and Taiwan. All of the stories in the collection make use of allusions to particular regions in mainland China; this story's allusion to Kweilin is special, since that is the author's home province, Kweilin (Guilin). Through references to food, landscape, and the unique Kweilin opera, he suggests the particular poignancy of exile from that place. =Autumn Reveries (秋思)= Autumn means \\"aging,\\" and this jewel of a story focuses on the power and fragility of beauty. The story alludes to the use of the chrysanthemum as a symbol of the transience of life—its brilliant, brief flowering followed by excruciating decline—in Chinese (and Japanese) culture. =A Sky Full of Bright, Twinkling Stars (滿天裏亮晶晶的星星)= Capturing a \\"beat\\" sensibility that finds extended development in much Taiwan literature, this story about (gay) street characters who frequent Taipei's New Park—The Guru, Ah Hsiung the Primitive, Dark-and-Handsome, Little Jade—concludes with a potent symbol of how very different people (and peoples) are thrown into each other's arms. This story alludes to the bright effluorescence of the Shanghai film industry in the '20s and '30s. =Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream (遊園驚夢)= The collection's eponymous story is a tour-de-force of Chinese cultural allusion, as it contrasts the pre-Taiwan condition of a group of Kun Opera singers (Fragrant Cassia, Heavenly Pepper, Red Red Rose) with their current position as wives (or ex-wives or widows) of prominent society figures (Madan Ch'ien . . . Madam Tou . . . Madam Jen . . . . ). The story interweaves abundant allusion to a specific variety of Chinese opera called Kunqu in general, including its many roles and unique sounds, together with a specific episode from the opera The Peony Pavilion (\\"Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream\\"). Moreover, these are interwoven with allusions to the dashing and machismo of the Kuomintang officer corps and a whole host of allusions to the sensuous pleasures of elite Chinese societies - the shimmer of silk cheongsam, the smell of high quality rosewood Chinese furniture, the taste of dishes from Chinese cuisine specially selected for the event. Kunqu is itself native to the area near Nanjing and Suzhou in China, in other words, it refers to the seat of Kuomintang government and support prior to exile in Taiwan. The story alludes to specific dishes of the Huaiyang cuisine, another reminder of the Nanjing area. =Winter Night (冬夜)= In a richly ironic tale, two professors talk about their careers, and the contrast between their glorious and idealistic student days—particularly their role in the student demonstrations that ushered in the May Fourth Movement—and the feelings of failure, hypocrisy, and desertion that they currently battle. =State Funeral (國葬)= This story takes a none-too-subtle parting shot at the Mainlander ethos. At a state funeral for an important general such as his father, the general's old aide is bewildered to confront the old and feeble men who once constituted China's \\"Steel Army\\" and \\"Iron Forces.\\" The only connection to the old Mainland idea seems to be the long line of black limousines, \\"like a serpent,\\" in the funeral procession. This story, written about 7 years before the death of Chiang Kai-shek seems to foretell the inevitable consequences of the natural death of the KMT's military leaders.

He established a research archive of about a million pages and interviews (mostly audio on about 1,000 cassettes) which were at his Brooklyn home. By 1978 the archive held over 10,000 documents on Jewish residents of Shanghai.Strauss, Herbert Albert (1978). Jewish immigrants of the Nazi period in the USA. K.G. Saur, p. 76.

Le Lien Francophone, N°40, 13. Retrieved 19 September 2019. In his book Thy Brother's Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust (1987), Kranzler argued that more lives could have been saved if American-Jewish leaders had lent more support to efforts in Europe to halt the deportations, including the attempts, in Slovakia and Hungary, to bribe and/or pay ransom to the SS. Criticizing the book's factual accuracy, Efraim Zuroff described it as \\"an extremely one-sided polemic\\" and \\"a popular invective of limited scholarly value\\". In the view of historian Robert Moses Shapiro, the book's defects, particularly its bitter tone and poor editing, undermined its \\"important and gripping story\\". The mid-1944 grassroots protests in Switzerland, including street demonstrations, Sunday sermons and the Swiss press campaign of about 400 headlines about the atrocities were triggered by George Mantello making public a summary of the Auschwitz Report (Vrba–Wetzler report) is the subject of Kranzler's book The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador and Switzerland's Finest Hour (2000), which has a foreword by Joe Lieberman. The Vrba–Wetzler report, written by two Auschwitz escapees, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, and distributed mostly by the Bratislava Working Group, provided a detailed account of the mass murder taking place inside the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kranzler was convinced that Mantello's campaign to publicize the report led to the stopping of the mass transports of Jews from Hungary to Auschwitz in July 1944, and enabled the Raoul Wallenberg mission and other important initiatives in Hungary and elsewhere.

Its upperparts are dark brown, with grey to brownish under parts and head. Its bill and legs are red. Taxonomy The small-billed tinamou is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Behavior Like other tinamous, the small-billed eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Domestication The small billed tinamou has been considered an ideal candidate for domestication as the birds can raise 3-4 broods per year and are resistant to diseases that affect chickens Range and habitat The small- billed tinamou prefers dry savanna, but will also reside in lowland shrubland.BirdLife International (2008) Its range is Amazonian South America; Brazil except for the southeastern portion, northeastern Peru, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina.

Before the Hyde Amendment took effect in 1980, an estimated 300,000 abortions were performed annually using taxpayer funds. The original Hyde Amendment was passed in 1976 on September 30 by the House of Representatives with a 312–93 vote to override the veto of a funding bill for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). It was named for its chief sponsor, Republican Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois. The measure represents one of the first major legislative gains by the United States anti-abortion movement, especially the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment led by lobbyist Mark Gallagher,New York Times, November 27, 1977, IV, 4 after the striking-down of anti-abortion laws following the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade. Congress subsequently altered the Hyde Amendment several times. The version in force from 1981 until 1993 prohibited the use of federal funds for abortions \\"except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\\"See, e.g., Pub.L. No. 101-166, § 204, 103 Stat. 1159, 1177 (1989). On October 22, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994.Pub.L. No. 103-112, 107 Stat. 1082 (1993). Uscode.house.gov The Act contained a new version of the Hyde Amendment that expanded the category of abortions for which federal funds are available under Medicaid to include cases of rape and incest.Id. § 509, 107 Stat. at 1113 (the 1994 Hyde Amendment). Legislation, including the Hyde Amendment, generally restricts the use of funds allocated for the Department of Health and Human Services and consequently has significant effects involving Medicaid recipients. As of 2016, Medicaid currently serves approximately 15.6 million women in the United States, including 1 in 5 women of reproductive age (women aged 15–44). In 2018, 37% of Americans said that the practice of abortion should be illegal in most cases, while 58% said it should be legal in most cases, results consistent with prior years. A minority of U.S. adults take an absolutist position, that abortion should be either illegal (15%) or legal (25%) in all cases. The Hyde Amendment itself was supported by 57% of voters and opposed by 36%, as of 2016. The 2016 Democratic platform marked the first time the party included an explicit call to repeal the Hyde Amendment in its platform. On January 24, 2017, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 7, which, according to the press office of Speaker Paul Ryan, \\"makes the Hyde amendment permanent.\\" The bill failed to pass the Senate and did not become law.  Background  Pro-life Congressman Henry J. Hyde The Hyde Amendment was introduced by pro-life Congressman Henry J. Hyde and first passed by Congress in 1977, four years after Roe vs. Wade. Implementation of the initial amendment was blocked for almost a year by an injunction in the McRae v. Matthews case. During this case, the Reproductive Freedom Project, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and Planned Parenthood collectively represented a pregnant Medicaid recipient and health care providers who challenged the Hyde Amendment. The United States Supreme Court vacated the injunction in August 1977, leading abortions financed by federal Medicaid to drop from 300,000 per year to a few thousand. Other bans were modeled after the Hyde Amendment, extending to other annual spending bills in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This eventually led federal funds to be banned in federal worker health plans, women in federal prisons, women in the military, peace corps volunteers, and international family planning programs that use non-U.S. funds to perform or advocate for abortion. The Hyde Amendment has been reenacted every year since 1976, but exceptions have varied. For example, the 1978 Amendment presented new exceptions for rape survivors and incest cases. However, in 1980, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the original Hyde Amendment language with a 5–4 vote in Harris v. McRae. The majority found that the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Establishment Clause under the First Amendment or due process/equal protection provided by the Fifth Amendment. This case decided the single exception for the Amendment would be in cases where the woman's life is endangered. This decision was upheld from fiscal years 1981–1993. While the Supreme Court came close to reintroducing exceptions for cases of rape or incest in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services of Missouri, President George H.W. Bush succeeded in vetoing the bill despite an attempted House override. This decision left the Amendment with the sole exception of concern being endangered life of the mother. The language was not altered until the Clinton Administration in 1993. At this time, the Hyde Amendment was once again expanded to include exceptions for rape and incest cases. Later in Williams v. Zbaraz (1980), the United States Supreme Court upheld that states could constitutionally make their own versions of the Hyde Amendment, and states/the federal government have no statutory or constitutional obligation to fund elective abortions. Currently, 17 states extend abortion coverage to women enrolled in Medicaid through their own budgets, and 6 states extend abortion coverage when a woman's health is at risk. The remainder of the country abides by the Hyde Amendment. South Dakota expands on the Hyde Amendment and restricts funding even in cases of rape or incest. As of 1994, federal law mandates all states to pay for abortion cases involving rape or incest, proving South Dakota's actions to be problematic. On January 24, 2017, the House voted to make the Hyde Amendment (H.R. 7) permanent. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated that \\"We are a pro-life Congress,\\" and he reaffirmed the government's commitment to restricting tax money to funding abortions. The bill failed to become law after it was never brought to a vote in the Senate.  Supporting arguments  Supporters of Hyde argue that it protects the conscience of taxpayers opposed to abortion. Proponents of the amendment maintain that the Hyde Amendment is an enforcement of \\"religious liberty and conscience\\" of Pro-Life Americans who do not wish to financially support the act of abortion. Proponents of Hyde also point out the fact that it is supported by 57% of the American public and opposed by 36%, as of 2016. Ariana Grosu, of the lobbying group Family Research Council argues that Hyde has saved the lives of 2 million fetuses, which are considered human beings in her view. Supporters argue that the reason many of them are unwilling to compromise on abortion and the Hyde Amendment is that a life is at risk and when the choice to have sex is consensual and not from rape, women should take responsibility for the consequences.  Opposing arguments Critics argue the Hyde Amendment disproportionately affects low-income women, women of color, younger women, and immigrants, as an estimated 42% of abortion recipients live below the poverty line. Since the passage of the Hyde Amendment, more than one million women have not been able to afford abortions and so have had to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Eighteen to 33 percent of Medicaid-eligible women who want abortions have been forced to give birth because they live in states that do not provide funding. Opponents also argue that people should be legally allowed to make their own choices about their bodies, and have access to the resources necessary to execute those choices. With the Hyde Amendment in effect, 60% of Planned Parenthood's 2.4 million patients cannot use public health aid for abortion care.  Effects and implications of the Hyde Amendment  The Hyde Amendment restricts abortion coverage for federally- funded healthcare recipients, specifically women enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, Native American women, U.S. servicewomen and veterans, women in Peace Corps, female federal employees, D.C. women residents, and women in immigration detention facilities and prisons. The Hyde Amendment does not preclude women who receive healthcare through the U.S. government the option of paying for the procedure out of pocket. According to a 2014 national survey of abortion patients, women in states without Medicaid coverage of abortion were three times as likely to pay for their abortions out of pocket and five times as likely to rely on financial assistance from an abortion fund compared to women in states with Medicaid coverage. State actions thumbrightStates that fund abortions Despite widespread efforts to further restrict abortion coverage at the state level, some states are striving to ensure coverage of abortion services in the face of funding bans. Even with the passage of the Hyde Amendment, some 17 states have a policy to use their own Medicaid funds to pay for abortion care beyond the Hyde Amendment requirements, and an estimated 20% of abortions are paid through Medicaid. There are currently 16 states who use their own state funds to pay for elective abortions and similar services. These states include Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Consequently, the cutoff of federal Medicaid funds prompted some states to provide public funding for abortion services from their own coffers. Over time the number of states doing so has gradually expanded, either through legislation or consequent to judicial rulings mandating equal access to health care for low-income women. Currently, 15 states restrict coverage in accordance with the Hyde Amendment. Specific stipulations have been put in place by some state governments. Some of these provisions remove restrictions that have been put in place at the federal level while others are used to further extend the reach that Hyde Amendment has put into place. For example, in Iowa, in order to receive an abortion under the Medicaid program, approval must be given from the governor. In Iowa, Mississippi, and Virginia, a provision has been made for the case of fetal impairment.  Further developments  =Stupak-Pitts 2010= The Stupak–Pitts Amendment, an amendment to the Affordable Health Care for America Act, was introduced by Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan. It prohibits use of Federal funds \\"to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion\\" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother, and was included in the bill as passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009. However, the Senate bill passed by the House on March 21, 2010 did not contain that Hyde Amendment language. As part of an agreement between Rep. Stupak and President Obama to secure Stupak's vote, the President issued Executive Order 13535 on March 24, 2010 affirming that the Hyde Amendment would extend to the new bill. = Hillary Clinton 2016 = The 2016 Democratic platform marked the first major political party platform to include an explicit call to repeal the Hyde Amendment. The platform states: > We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman > should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including > safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she > makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to > women's, men's, and young people's health and well being. We will continue > to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health > centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We > will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and > policies that impede a woman's access to abortion, including by repealing > the Hyde Amendment. Hillary Clinton advocated for a repeal of the Hyde Amendment throughout her 2016 Presidential campaign. She was quoted as saying, \\"Any right that requires you to take extraordinary measures to access it is no right at all\\" at a campaign rally in New Hampshire.

It has about 3,600 inhabitants. It lies some south-west from the region capital of Plzeň upon the Radbuza River. Stod is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence. History The first written mention of Stod dates from 1235, when Wenceslaus I of Bohemia left the village to the monastery Chotěšov. In 1315 John of Bohemia raised the villages status to that of a market town. By the period of Charles IV in 1363, the town acquired more privileges, such as a judiciary, the right to use a city seal, and to keep the city's books. In 1544 the town was granted the privilege of establishing a malt-house and a brewery. By 1547 there was a post office and in 1550 granted Ferdinand I allowed the town to stage an annual fair. The town was set back by the turmoil of the Thirty Years War. By 1654, the settlement was almost deserted, with only about 230 residents. Consequently tracts of land were distributed to German families from Bavaria to repopulate the region. By 1850 Stod had grown to approximately 1500 residents (almost entirely German speaking) and the town received civic rights. The town was the seat of a local District Court. At this time some local German peasants could not afford to buy land so in 1863 a small group, led by a former Austrian army officer named Captain Martin Krippner, left to settle Puhoi in New Zealand. (This has given Puhoi the popular appellation of the \\"Bohemian Settlement\\".) In 1938 the town was part of the Sudetenland annexed by Nazi Germany. After World War II, the German population was stripped of their property and expelled following the Beneš decrees. Between 1949 and 1960 there were various local government reforms following the massive population changes.

Taxonomy This is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Description The barred tinamou is approximately in length. It is yellowish-buff with heavy bars of black on its back, its throat is white, its front and sides of neck and breast are pale grey, its belly is white, its flanks are cream barred with black, and its head and neck are chestnut in color with legs that are olive-green. The female is paler on back. Behavior Like other tinamous, the barred tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat It prefers to live in tropical and sub-tropical lowland forests at an altitude of or lower.BirdLife International (2008) This species is native to eastern Colombia and southern Venezuela.Clements, J (2007) Conservation The IUCN classifies the barred tinamou as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

'Galaxy',Clarke (2007b) is a small cyprinid from Myanmar. It has so far been found only in a very small area near Hopong east of Inle Lake, at an altitude of over 1,000 m (3,400 ft). Its habitat is part of the Salween basin, namely the Nam Lang and Nam Pawn Rivers. Discovered in 2006, the species quickly appeared in the aquarium trade, where its small size and bright colours made it an instant hit.Clarke (2006) Description This is a small, plump danionin with a markedly blunt snout, measuring just 2–2.5 cm standard length. The body is about three times as long as it is high. In general shape, it resembles Danio erythromicron more than any other known species. Adult female This species shows some sexual dimorphism: males have a bright-blue background color (dull blue-green in females), and their fins are more brightly colored. The tail end of their bodies (the caudal peduncle) is also higher than in females. The body is sprinkled with small, pearly dots. The back is bronzy green, and the belly in females is yellowish-white. The gill covers are transparent, letting the blood-red gills shine through. The males will prominently display their unpaired fins to conspecifics. All fins, save the pectoral fins, show two parallel black lines with a bright red area in between; on the tail fin, this pattern is present twice (once on each lobe) and the outer black band is vestigial. Females have a weaker version of the pattern in the tail and dorsal fins only, sometimes in the anal fin, too. A courting male develops a red belly and the flanks brighten and darken, making the pearly spots stand out even more, with the back appearing paler than the flanks and also standing out. A female in reproductive age can be recognized by a black anal spot which separates the belly color from the uniformly reddish base of the anal fin. The male has a small black pad at the edges of the lower jaw, which is absent or reduced in females. Immature fish show some indication of a striped pattern, which eventually decomposes into the pearly dots. File:danio_männchen_2.jpgMale File:Danio_männchen_3.jpgMale File:danio_weibchen_2.jpgFemale  Systematics and taxonomy  Initially, the celestial pearl danio was assumed to be a member of the genus Microrasbora, due to its similarity to \\"Microrasbora\\" erythromicron. Less than a year after the discovery of the celestial pearl danio, it was scientifically described and given the genus name Celestichthys. In 2008, a more comprehensive study showed the celestial pearl danio was a member of the genus Danio, with Danio erythromicron and Danio choprae as its closest relatives. Ecology The fish lives in small ponds created by seeping groundwater or overflow from small brooks or springs. Water temperature in January was rather low (22–24 °C), but as the habitat is very shallow, it would heat up quickly during hot spells, thus D. margaritatus is probably tolerant of temperatures above the low 20s. As in most water bodies in the Inle drainage, the water is slightly alkaline. The habitat is heavily vegetated with Hydrocharitaceae similar to Elodea (water weed). The celestial pearl danio shares its habitat with a very few fish species: a Microrasbora similar to M. rubescens, a rosy loach (Yunnanilus, possibly a new species, and the dwarf snakehead Channa harcourtbutleri.\\"harbourtbutleri\\" in Roberts (2007) is a lapsus. The latter species presumably is the only known significant predator of D. margaritatus.Clarke (2007a) mentions Danio sondhii, but not Microrasbora and Channa; it is not clear on what data this information is based. The species is locally fished for food to some extent; it is dried and bought as a protein source by poor people. A can of some 500 D. margaritatus sold for food fetched about 25 kyat (about 2 UK pounds/3.9 US$/2.7 EUROfficial exchange rate of January 21, 2008, as per XE.com Universal Currency Converter.) before the fish was discovered for the aquarium trade.Clarke (2007a) =Reproduction= The spawning behavior has significant consequences for captive breeding (see below). The celestial pearl danio appears to be adapted to somewhat ephemeral habitats. It does not have a dedicated spawning season, nor do the females lay continuously. Rather, they produce small batches of around 30 eggs per spawning episode. The time between spawnings is unknown at present. Eggs are not strewn freely into the water, but they are not deposited in clutches to a prepared surface either; rather, it seems, that they are hidden away in vegetation as a loose batch. Courting males will seek out and try to defend a patch of dense vegetation. While pursuit swimming has been observed, it does not seem to be connected directly to the actual act of reproduction in which the male displays to a passing female, and tests her readiness with a brief chase. The pair then moves into the substrate and deposits the eggs. Other males noticing reproduction will try to follow the mating pair, either to try to fertilize the eggs with their own sperm or eat them. At 24–25 °C, the larvae hatch after 3–4 days. They are dark and cryptic initially and for about three days after hatching, they hide away between substrate and detritus and are very hard to see. They subsequently become lighter in color and start swimming freely and feeding on their own. At some 8–10 weeks after hatching, they undergo metamorphosis to adult form, and the color pattern starts to appear from week 12 onwards. Status and conservation Within six months of its appearance in the aquarium trade, the species was falsely reported as having become so rare, collectors were obtaining only a \\"few dozen fish per day\\". Initially, only a small number of aquarists managed to breed the fish successfully, while nearly all the fish offered for sale were wild-caught. The (unfounded) concern over the wild populations led British fishkeeping magazine Practical Fishkeeping to request that only aquarists prepared to breed the fish should buy any fish they see for sale, to reduce pressure on the wild stocks by diminishing the demand for them in the UK. As the species seems adapted to living in and colonizing small, possibly ephemeral pools, it seemed not very well able to withstand prolonged and intense exploitation—if the stock in all pools at one location is entirely fished off, it is unclear in how far the fish would be able to recolonize them. Conversely, if only part of a local subpopulation is removed, pools from which all celestial pearl danios have been removed likely will be recolonized with a healthy population again after one year or so. The dire warnings reported by Clarke, later in 2007 were found to be unfounded. The celestial pearl danio is prolific, spawning \\"almost every day\\", causing ponds that were thought to be empty to be fully restocked a few months later as fry hatched, grew, and reproduced quickly.Hellweg (2007) The government of Myanmar banned exports of the fish in February 2007. However, an inquest into the species by Myanmar officials discovered populations of the fish in at least \\"five locations around Hopong\\".\\"celestialpearldanio.com\\"Clarke (2007c) Currently, the fish is captive-bred worldwide commercially and by hobbyists,celestialpearldanio.com (forum) pushing the price down from its initial high of $20 or more per fish to around $4 each. In the aquarium The celestial pearl danio is a rather undemanding fish if its basic requirements are being met. It does not require much space, as it is not a very active swimmer, and is not a true shoaling fish, meaning it does not require large numbers of conspecifics for its well- being. In a small tank, a group of six individuals—half males, half females—will do well and exhibit natural behavior. They tend to be rather stationary, hovering in a peculiar position in favorite spots; males and females tend to keep separate when at rest. Altogether, their behavior again resembles Danio erythromicron more than other fish. Tanks for the celestial pearl danio should be well-planted and direct daylight may be favorable (the natural habitat is so shallow as to be well lit throughout). Water weed and similar plants should be abundant, and stones and wood to create hiding spots should be provided. It is advisable to supply the fish with a spawning mop or a dense growth of suitable plants (java moss has been successfully used). A dense tangle of natural plants for spawning has the additional advantage of harboring protists on which the fry feed initially. The celestial pearl danio seems overall quite peaceful, though some fin-nipping occurs. Consequently, it cannot be kept with large or \\"bully\\" fish. Small, swarming danionins which require similar water conditions would be a natural choice for company, as such more active species provide nice contrast behaviorally and, being available in a wide range of colors and patterns, also make it possible to choose fish that complement the brilliant colors of D. margaritatus. Many danionins prefer slightly acidic water, however, and maintaining the rather high pH found across the Inle basin seems a necessary condition to keep fish from there successfully.

Tidal tails occur as a result of galactic tide forces between interacting galaxies. Examples of galaxies with tidal tails include the Tadpole Galaxy and the Mice Galaxies. Tidal forces can eject a significant amount of a galaxy's gas into the tail; within the Antennae Galaxies, for example, nearly half of the observed gaseous matter is found within the tail structures. Within those galaxies which have tidal tails, approximately 10% of the galaxy's stellar formation takes place in the tail. Overall, roughly 1% of all stellar formation in the known universe occurs within tidal tails. Some interacting galaxy pairs have two distinct tails, as is the case for the Antennae Galaxies, while other systems have only one tail. Most tidal tails are slightly curved due to the rotation of the host galaxies. Those that are straight may actually be curved but still appear to be straight if they are being viewed edge-on.  History  The phenomena now referred to as tidal tails were first studied extensively by Fritz Zwicky in 1953. Several astrophysicists expressed their doubts that these extensions could occur solely as the result of tidal forces, including Zwicky himself, who described his own views as \\"unorthodox\\". Boris Vorontsov- Velyaminov argued that the tails were too thin and too long (sometimes as large as 100,000 parsecs) to have been produced by gravity alone, as gravity should instead produce broad distortions. However, in 1972, renowned astronomer Alar Toomre proved that it was indeed tidal forces that were responsible for the tails.

Ulster Defence Association Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland into a Protestant family, McDonald attended Larkfield Secondary School later known as Balmoral High School in South Belfast. He lives in the south Belfast housing estate of Taughmonagh. His paramilitary activities have attracted considerable publicity from the media, and he was the subject of interviews by journalist Peter Taylor for the latter's book Loyalists.Taylor. Loyalists. Described by journalist Rosie Cowan as the UDA's most powerful player, he is an outspoken critic of former Ulster Freedom Fighters'Note:\\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" is a cover name of the UDA notorious brigadier, Johnny Adair.\\"Too many chiefs led to loyalist bloodshed\\". The Guardian, by Rosie Cowan. 4 February 2003 He joined the UDA in 1972 about a year after it was formed in Belfast as an umbrella organisation for loyalist vigilante groups. These groups, such as the Woodvale Defence Association (WDA) and Shankill Defence Association (SDA), had sprung up in loyalist areas following the outbreak of The Troubles in the late 1960s as a means of protecting their local communities from attacks by nationalists. He was a member of the Taughmonagh C Battalion South Belfast Brigade. He was already a senior UDA member when he played a part in the Ulster Workers Council Strike, helping people on his south Belfast housing estate obtain food, medicine, transport and other necessities during the general strike which had brought Northern Ireland to a standstill in May 1974.Taylor, pp.133–34 At this time he held a job as dispatches manager for the Balmoral Furniture Company in the Shankill Road.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: a History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. p.40 It had been the target of a Provisional IRA bomb in December 1971, in which four people had died, including two infants. According to author Ian S. Wood, McDonald was almost killed during the strike when Military Police fired upon the hijacked vehicle he was driving in a chase along the Lisburn Road into Sandy Row.Wood, p.43 When receiving his social security payments during the strike, McDonald received a military salute from his boss when he walked into the latter's office wearing his complete UDA combat uniform.Wood, p.41 Brigadier In the mid-1980s, McDonald became part of UDA \\"fundraiser\\" Jim Craig's large protection racket.Taylor, pp.170–71 In 1988, just after the death of UDA's South Belfast brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in a booby-trap car bomb planted by the Provisional IRA outside his home in Lisburn, Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie promoted McDonald to the rank of brigadier.Taylor, p.170 He subsequently assumed command of McMichael's South Belfast brigade having previously served as his second-in-command. Described by Peter Taylor as an \\"effective and popular commander\\",Taylor, p.199 many people, however considered McDonald to have been one of Craig's \\"henchmen in the latter's profitable racketeering business.\\" According to Steve Bruce Tyrie's appointment of McDonald as Brigadier helped to hasten Tyrie's own downfall due to the distaste with which McDonald was then regarded by a number of leading UDA figures. Due to his reputation as a racketeer and his close association with the widely disliked Craig and his equally loathed deputy and minder Artie Fee, a number of UDA modernisers, who were the chief critics of Tyrie, released statements to both the local media and BBC Newsnight condemning McDonald's appointment.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 252 McDonald admitted to Taylor: \\"Through not being able to get a job anywhere else and not being able to look after my own family and being part of the organisation that needed the money, eventually I did [join Craig] yes.\\" The same year McDonald took over the South Belfast brigade, Andy Tyrie resigned as UDA commander and James Craig was put permanently out of the picture. The latter was shot dead in the \\"Bunch of Grapes\\" pub in east Belfast by two masked gunmen from the UDA (using their cover name \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\") in October 1988 for \\"treason\\". It was claimed by younger elements within the UDA that he had set up John McMichael to be targeted by the IRA. McDonald was arrested in 1989, and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the Maze Prison for extortion, blackmail and intimidation in January 1990.Taylor,pp.170–71The Guardian 4 February 2003Irish Tribune 23 November 2008 Following his imprisonment he was replaced as brigadier by Alex Kerr.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA – Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 160 He was released in 1994. Return to power Returning to his role as brigadier after Kerr defected to the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) group which was founded by Billy Wright in 1996, McDonald found himself in 1997 facing the possibility of a loyalist feud with the local Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), with whom he had previously been on good terms. In June 1997, the son of murdered UDA man, James Curtis Moorehead, shot and killed his father's killer, the UVF's Robert \\"Basher\\" Bates (who was also part of the Shankill Butchers gang, led by Lenny Murphy), leading to the Shankill Road UDA \\"exiling\\" the young killer to Taughmonagh. UVF members began to prowl McDonald's Taughmonagh stronghold looking for the killer, and a clash between the Donegall Pass UVF and the Sandy Row UDA looked imminent as relations deteriorated both in South Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland as a whole. McDonald did not want a war with the UVF and, according to authors Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, ultimately negotiated a settlement whereby the killer would be housed on the edge of Taugmonagh and told to keep a low profile.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 290–291 The UDA gave its support to the Belfast Agreement in 1998 although McDonald was one of three Inner Council members – the others being John Gregg and Billy McFarland – who was less convinced about its merits, particularly the prospect of Sinn Féin entering any power-sharing executive.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 302 Nonetheless McDonald did not advocate a return to armed struggle and in late 1999 when it became clear that a feud between the UVF and LVF was about to begin he joined fellow brigadiers McFarland, Gregg and Jim Gray in announcing that the UDA would not be getting involved. Such sentiments were not echoed by west Belfast brigadier Johnny Adair however as he saw the LVF as close allies and resented the UVF.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 314 Clashes with Johnny Adair McDonald grew further apart from Adair as the year 2000 progressed. Whilst supporting the Orange Order's desire to march through nationalist areas, McDonald was a lot less enthusiastic than Adair about getting involved in the Drumcree conflict. He had grown weary of seeing the mainstream unionist parties seek to ally themselves to loyalist paramilitaries when it was expedient only to sever any links as soon as the relationship no longer suited them.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 319 Similarly he was unconvinced by a series of vandalism attacks on loyalist areas in Belfast in late June by three carloads of \\"republicans\\", feeling that the missile throwing youths were actually members of Adair's C Company sent to stir up sectarian hatred and win support for Adair's Drumcree strategy.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 319–320 McDonald was one of a number of brigadiers to accept Adair's invitation to a \\"Loyalist Day of Culture\\" on the Shankill Road on 19 August 2000 but was shocked to find that C Company had used the day to drive UVF members and their families from the road, even attacking the homes of such UVF \\"elder statesmen\\" as Gusty Spence and Winston Churchill Rea. At the culmination of the day, McDonald and other brigadiers, as well as Deputy Lord Mayor of Belfast Frank McCoubrey, were brought onto a makeshift stage where C Company members emerged and fired machine guns into the air in a show of strength.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 326–327 McDonald however retained his earlier attitude towards feuding with the C Company UDA, and along with McFarland and Gray, told his men to leave the Shankill that evening.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 330 McDonald promptly contacted his opposite number in the South Belfast UVF and concluded a pact that their members would not attack each other.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 336 Even when the initial feud cooled, the enmity between McDonald and Adair continued to simmer and in Inner Council meetings the two frequently clashed as, according to one veteran loyalist, \\"Jackie was the only one with the balls to stand up to him\\".McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 370 Nonetheless when Adair was released from prison on 15 May 2002, McDonald, arguing that he deserved a second chance and hoping that his return to prison may have mellowed him, was one of the brigadiers to appear at Adair's Boundary Way home and welcome him back in front of the television cameras.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 303 The public show of bonhomie between McDonald and Adair did not result in improved relations in the long term. On 14 September 2002, East Belfast LVF man Stephen Warnock was killed by the Red Hand Commando and immediately afterwards Adair, seeing an opportunity to strike back at a rival, went to his family home to inform visiting LVF members that the killing had been actually ordered by Jim Gray. On Adair's encouragement, an LVF hit team waited for Gray to appear at Warnock's house where, after he paid his respects to the family, he was shot in the face as he left. Gray was seriously injured but survived the attack.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 371–372 McDonald called a crisis meeting of brigadiers, including Adair, at Sandy Row but it failed to reach a conclusion as Adair denied involvement in the attack on Gray. As soon as the meeting was over, Adair drove to Ballysillan in north Belfast to meet with allies in the LVF, although he was unaware that a mainstream UDA team were following him and recording his movements.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 318–319 When McDonald was told about this second meeting he secured agreement with the other brigadiers that Adair should be expelled from the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 374 Tension simmered for the next few months with little real fighting although McDonald threw a ring of steel around his Taughmonagh stronghold and even obtained an air raid siren to be sounded if any C Company members attempted to enter the estate.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 375 The killing of John Gregg and his associate Rab Carson by C Company in Sailortown on 1 February 2003 however finally led to a showdown, with McDonald taking charge of the anti-Adair faction. McDonald quickly got word to A and B Company of the West Belfast UDA, covering the Highfield estate and Woodvale areas of the Greater Shankill and nominally under Adair's command, that Adair was to be removed and secured the loyalty of these two groups. He also told them to set up an office on the Shankill's Heather Street Social Club as a safe house where members of C Company could defect back to the mainstream UDA.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 383–384 At around 1 a.m. on 6 February 2003, about 100 heavily armed UDA members invaded the lower Shankill and set upon the twenty or so members of C Company who had remained loyal to Adair. For his part Adair fled the scene with his family and his close ally John White, ending his spell in charge on the Shankill.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 386 Several weeks later McDonald organised a \\"battle of the bands\\" (competition between loyalist flute bands) at which he made it clear that unity had been re-established. He then received a standing ovation from those present as, marching behind a masked man carrying an AK 47, McDonald led the other five brigadiers onto the stage.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 395 When asked by Peter Taylor whether he had any regrets about his past involvements, McDonald replied: > I have certainly. I would say without a shadow of doubt the worst thing that > ever happened to South Belfast, John McMichael and myself especially, was > that Jim Craig ever had anything to do with our organisation.Taylor, p.172 Subsequent activity The John McMichael Centre in Sandy Row, Belfast, where McDonald works as a full-time organiser McDonald remains a member of the UDA's Inner Council and is also the spokesman for its political advisory body, the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG). Politically he always considered former Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) spokesman Davy Adams to be his main political advisor.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 315 He has in recent years turned his attention to community-building activities and helping former loyalist prisoners as a full-time organiser of the John McMichael Centre in Belfast's Sandy Row district, named after his deceased friend and former comrade.Irish Tribune. 23 November 2008 Beginning in 2003, McDonald has held peace talks with Irish president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin.\\"Building Bridges with the UDA\\".

In October 2011 after accepting an invitation to attend an event in Belfast City Hall to unveil a new portrait of famous Irish republican and trade union leader James Connolly he was later forced to withdraw his attendance at the event.

The following individuals were members of the IIGEP: Members *Justice P.N. Bhagwati, India – Chairman, invited by the President *Prof. Ivan Shearer, nominated by Australia *Prof. Bruce Matthews, nominated by Canada *Mr. Bernard Kouchner, France, nominated by the European Commission *Judge Jean-Pierre Cot, France, nominated by the European Commission and replacing Mr. Kouchner *Prof. Sir Nigel Rodley, nominated by the UK *Prof. Yozo Yokota, nominated by Japan *Cees Fasseur, nominated by the Netherlands *Arthur “Gene” Dewey, nominated by USA *Mr. Marzuki Darusman, (nominated by the Inter-Parliamentary Union) *Kamal Hussein, Bangladesh (nominated by OHCHR) *Mr. Andres Mauromatis, Cyprus (nominated by GoSL) Mandate The mandate of the IIGEP has come under criticism from several human rights organisations, underlining its inherent weaknesses, including: IIGEP did not have independent access to witnesses or conduct independent investigations, and the Commission of Inquiry early indicated that IIGEP were to observe and not investigate. The reports of the IIGEP where submitted to the President, who has the power to veto publication of information sensitive to national security - this is seen as especially disturbing given that Sri Lankan armed forces have been implicated in several of the killings that are to be investigated by the Commission of Inquiry. None of IIGEPs reports to the President have been publicized so far. Resignation The members of IIGEP at their November 2007 plenary concluded that they would terminate the IIGEP observation role with effect from April 1, 2008 and informed President Mahinda Rajapakse of their decision. In their concluding public statement, they outlined that they did not see that continued observation would change the situation, and that despite IIGEP drawing attention to defects in the workings of the Commission, their recommendations have been largely disregarded. In an IIGEP press briefing on April 22, 2008, three members of the IIGEP clarified matters relating to their resignation. Sir Nigel Rodley characterized some of the communications to the IIGEP, including to its chairman as 'very disrespectful', and added that the latest AG response to the April 14th IIGEP public statements contained baseless allegations that the IIGEP were working according to a secret agenda in order to force UN Human Rights Monitoring onto Sri Lanka in defiance of Sri Lankas sovereignty. The IIGEP Chairman, P.N. Bhagwati, outlined that the allegations that the IIGEP did not understand the Sri Lankan legal system were irrelevant, as IIGEPs mandate calls for the group to comment on whether the proceedings conform to international standards, not Sri Lankan standards. Professor Yozo Yokota reminded the press corps that, contrary to government statements, the IIGEP is not a European group, but consists of experts from all over the world. Main findings The main concerns of the IIGEP were: * A lack of political will from the Government of Sri Lanka to support a search for the truth. * A conflict of interest in the proceedings before the Commission, with officers from the Attorney General playing an inappropriate and impermissible role in the proceedings. * Lack of effective victim and witness protection * Lack of transparency and timeliness in the proceedings * Lack of full cooperation by State bodies * Lack of financial independence of the Commission Government response The Government of Sri Lanka responded to the resignation of the members of the IIGEP both formally through a responsehttp://www.iigep.org/prelease/agresponse1.pdf drafted by the Attorney General, where the AG argues that the IIGEP cannot terminate its existence but merely resign, and that the President then can nominate new Eminent Persons to carry on the task.

These awards grew out of early attempts by Robert Koch to generate funding to support his research into the cause and cure for tuberculosis. Koch discovered the bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) responsible for the dreaded disease and rapidly acquired international support, including 500,000 gold marks from the Scottish-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The Robert Koch Prize Since 1970, the Robert Koch Foundation has awarded prizes for major advances in the biomedical sciences, particularly in the fields of microbiology and immunology. The prestige of this award has grown over the past decades so that it is now widely regarded as the leading international scientific prize in microbiology. As has been described by a jury member for the prize, the committee often asks, \\"What would Robert Koch work on today?” to decide on research that should be granted recognition. The more specific Robert Koch Prize is commonly considered one of the stepping-stones (along with other prizes such as the Lasker Award) to eventual Nobel Prize recognition for scientists in the fields of microbiology and immunology, and a number of Robert Koch Prize winners subsequently became Nobel laureates, such as César Milstein, Susumu Tonegawa and Harald zur Hausen. Other notable awardees include Albert Sabin, Jonas Salk and John Enders for their pioneering work on the development of polio vaccines. Only Enders was recognized with a Nobel Prize, together with Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins. Two separate Robert Koch Awards are presented annually: The Gold Robert Koch Medallion for accumulated excellence in biomedical research and the Robert Koch Prize, €100,000, for a major discovery in biomedical science.

Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1995) * Tataupa is a Guarani term, referring to the bird's ashy-colored plumage. Taxonomy All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) =Subspecies= The Tataupa tinamou has four subspecies as follows: * C. t. tataupa Nominate race, occurs in eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and Paraguay. * C. t. inops occurs in northwestern Peru in the Marañón Valley,. and also extreme southern Ecuador * C. t. peruvianus occurs in west central Peru in the Chanchamayo Valley of Junín Region. * C. t. lepidotus occurs in northeastern Brazil; Bahia, Ceará, Piauí, Pernambuco, and Maranhão States. Description The tataupa tinamou is approximately in length. Its upper parts are dark brown, with a dark brown crown, a pale grey throat. It has darker grey on the sides of its head, neck, and breast, with a bu belly buff. Its bill and legs are purplish red. Behavior Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Like other tinamous, the tataupa tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat The Tataupa tinamou prefers dry forest up to altitude. It may also be found in lowland moist forest and degraded former forest habitats. This species is native to northeastern Brazil, eastern Bolivia, northern Argentina, Paraguay and western Peru in South America. It also has been sighted in extreme southern Ecuador.

Tyska Skolgränd () is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, stretching from Svartmangatan to Baggensgatan, and crossed by Själagårdsgatan. The present name of the street, first appeared as Tyska Scholæ Gatan on a map from the early 18th century. It is apparently derived from the German school in the late 16th century housed on number 8, Själagårdsgatan. The lot was thereafter bought by the German parish who had a first school building built in 1626, and a new completed in 1670. The building was subsequently enlarged and rebuilt on several occasions, the present buildings mostly date from 1887. The building, as it seem, was the one in general used by itinerant theatre groups in Stockholm during the 17th century. The German school was discontinued after more than 300 years, but a new German school, still in operation, was inaugurated on Östermalm in 1941. The part of the alley east of Själagårdsgatan appears under different names reflecting the various activities dominating it: In 1557, it is called Tynnebindare gaten referring to a hooper (e.g. maker of barrels) Peder Tunnbindare (\\"Peter Barrel-binder\\") known to have lived here in 1538. Located on the north side of the alley was, however, the potent Vårfrugillet av den tyska nationen (\\"Our Lady's guild of the German Nation\\"), which gave the alley the name Gillestugegaten (\\"Guild's Cottage's Street\\") in 1579. During the 18th century, the alley is also referred to as Persiljegränd (\\"Parsley Alley\\"), possibly a corruption (jocular or not) of the name of the extended block east of the alley, Perseus. Since the revision of street names in 1885, this alley is, however, made part of the western section. cartouche at Number 4.

Standing at 86.12 metres, the tower is the traditional symbol of Modena, being visible from all directions outside the city. The structure was set up in 1179 on five floors, initially called Torre di San Geminiano. To compete with Bologna's towers, the Comune added the characteristic octagonal cusp, designed by Arrigo da Campione, one of the numerous masters from Campione who took part in the cathedral's renovation in the 13th-15th centuries. The top of the tower is decorated with two ghirlande (two marble railings), whence the name. In the interior, the Sala della Secchia room (with 15th-century frescoes) is home of a copy of the depiction of the Secchia rapita, a memory of the tower's former role as treasury of the Modenese Comune. Also notable are the sculpted capitals in the Sala dei Torresani hall, in the fifth floor. The five bells are tuned in C major, cast during the Renaissance period.  Restoration  The tower underwent a restoration started in December 2007. At the beginning it was said it would be finished by the year 2010, but restoration work lasted till September 2011.

Their ethnogenesis is unclear; their origins remain untraced among scholars, but they are believed to be an Austronesian group, related to neighboring Ilocanos on purely linguistic basis. The culture of the Ivatans is partly influenced by the environmental condition of Batanes. Unlike the old-type nipa huts common in the Philippines, Ivatans have adopted their now-famous stone houses made of coral and limestone, designed to protect against the hostile climate. Origins Documents do not show much about the history of the Ivatans and at present, scholars who study their origins are still unsure as to their exact origin. They question whether the pre-historic Ivatans came from the northern part of Luzon or southern portions of China and Taiwan. There is evidence that they might be a surviving Christianized remnant of a people that once resided on all the islands between Luzon and Taiwan. However, the close physical resemblance of the Ivatans to the Malays and the structure of their language could mean they came from other parts of the Philippines. By tracing their roots through Batanes' folklores, Omoto, a Japanese anthropologist of the Yami of Orchid Island (Lanyu), has demonstrated a closer genetic affinity of the Yami to the Tagalog and Visayan and a linguistic connection to the Batanic (Bashiic) sub-branch of the Malayo- Polynesian branch. History An Ivatan man fresh from work. A Sinadumparan Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands. The house is made of limestone and coral and its roofing of cogon grass. Ivatans were living in Batanes before the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, protected by fortresses known as idjang, and living autonomously long thereafter. On June 26, 1783, Batanes was incorporated into the Spanish East Indies. In 1686, Ivatans were forced to resettle in the lowlands of Batanes. The Ivatans lived under Spanish rule for 115 years, and gained their independence on September 18, 1898. However, June 6 is celebrated in Batanes as its founding day. Physical attributes One of the earliest accounts of the Ivatan is that of the British buccaneer William Dampier in 1687. Dampier described them as \\"short, squat people; hazel eyes, small yet bigger than Chinese; low foreheads; thick eyebrows; short low noses; white teeth; black thick hair; and very dark, copper-colored skin.\\" They also have strong mixture of the short type of the Mongols, and there are some individuals who seem to have some physical characteristics peculiar to the Ainus of Japan. Demographics In 1990, population of the Ivatans was 15,026, an increase of 24% over the 1980 population of 12,091. These were distributed to the six municipalities, with 38% residing in Basco, 23% in Itbayat, 12% in Sabtang, 11% in Mahatao and 8% for Uyugan and Ivana. In the 2000 census, 15,834 Ivatans were among the 16,421 population in Batanes. An Ivatan woman wearing a vakul, a headgear for sunlight and rain protection made from vuyavuy palm fiber. The mother tongue of the Ivatans is the Chirin nu Ibatan, but is commonly known as Ivatan. A distinct Austronesian language, the Ivatan has two dialects includingBasco, the Itbayáten and possibly Yami. The Ivatans widely speak and understand the Ilocano, Tagalog, and English languages. Today, most Ivatans are Catholics, like the rest of the country, although some have not converted and practice ancestral worship to their anitos. However, there are growing Protestant denominations specially in Basco, the capital town of Batanes. Culture The Ivatan's culture have been largely influenced by the climate of Batanes. Due to severe climatic disruptions to their agriculture, Ivatans have developed numerous successful strategies to protect their food supply and way of life. Traditionally, because of frequent typhoons and drought, they plant root crops able to cope with the environment. These crops include yam, sweet potato, taro, garlic, ginger and onion, as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions. The Ivatan study the behavior of animals, sky color, wind and clouds to predict the weather. Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the payaman (communal pasture) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground. A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm. The sea is vital to the Ivatan's way of life. They depend on the flying fish (dibang) and dolphinfish (arayu) present on the shores of Batanes in the months of March through May. They have a native delicacy called uvod (the pith of the banana stalk) which is served with the wine palek, on festive occasions such as weddings. Before Spaniards arrived at the Philippines, Ivatans built their houses from cogon grass. These homes were small, well-situated,and designed to protect against strong winds. The Spaniards introduced large-scale production of lime to the Ivatan for the construction of their now-famous stone houses. Meter-thick limestone walls, are designed to protect against the harsh Batanes environment, which is known as a terminal passage of typhoons in the Philippines. The basic cogon grass is still preserved as roofs of their houses, thickly constructed to withstand strong winds. These houses are comparable to the white houses in New Zealand, Ireland and Scottish Highlands. One of the endemic clothing of the Ivatans is the vakul. A vakul is a headgear designed to protect the wearer from sun and rain. It is made from vuyavuy palm fiber. The Ivatan have three folk songs styles: the laji, the kanta and the kalusan. The laji are ancient lyrical songs that are supposed to be sung when they are merry or just finished work. The kalusan is sung during work. The Ivatan have legends that are called kabbata. They have the rawod, chants that chronicle the adventures of the Ivatan's forefathers as they escape a disaster.

The tombstones consisted mainly of thousands of khachkars - uniquely decorated cross-stones characteristic of medieval Christian Armenian art. The cemetery was still standing in the late 1990s, when the government of Azerbaijan began a systematic campaign to destroy the monuments. Several appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations, condemning the Azerbaijani government and calling on it to desist from such activity. In 2006, Azerbaijan barred European Parliament members from investigating the claims, charging them with a \\"biased and hysterical approach\\" to the issue and stating that it would only accept a delegation if it visited Armenian-controlled territory as well. In the spring of 2006, a journalist from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting who visited the area reported that no visible traces of the cemetery remained. In the same year, photographs taken from Iran showed that the cemetery site had been turned into a military shooting range. The destruction of the cemetery has been widely described by Armenian sources, and some non- Armenian sources, as an act of \\"cultural genocide.\\" After studying and comparing satellite photos of Julfa taken in 2003 and 2009, in December 2010 the American Association for the Advancement of Science came to the conclusion that the cemetery was demolished and leveled. History Nakhchivan is an exclave which belongs to Azerbaijan. Armenia's territory separates it from the rest of Azerbaijan. The exclave also borders Turkey and Iran. Lying near the Aras River, in the historical province of Syunik in the heart of the Armenian plateau, Jugha gradually grew from a village to a city during the late medieval period. In the sixteenth century, it boasted a population of 20,000-40,000 Armenians who were largely occupied with trade and craftsmanship. The oldest khachkars found at the cemetery at Jugha, located in the western part of the city, dated to the ninth to tenth centuries but their construction, as well as that of other elaborately decorated grave markers, continued until 1605, the year when Shah Abbas I of Safavid Persia instituted a policy of scorched earth and ordered the town destroyed and all its inhabitants removed.On this removal, see Edmund Herzig, \\"The Deportation of the Armenians in 1604-1605 and Europe's Myth of Shah Abbas I,\\" in History and Literature in Iran: Persian and Islamic studies in Honour of P.W. Avery, ed. Charles Melville (London: British Academic Press, 1998), pp. 59-71. In addition to the thousands of khachkars, Armenians also erected numerous tombstones in the form of rams, which were intricately decorated with Christian motifs and engravings. According to the French traveler Alexandre de Rhodes, the cemetery still had 10,000 well-preserved khachkars when he visited Jugha in 1648. However, many khachkars were destroyed from this period onward to the point that only 5,000 were counted standing in 1903–1904. Scottish artist and traveler Robert Ker Porter described the cemetery in his 1821 book as follows: Vazken S. Ghougassian, writing in Encyclopædia Iranica, described the cemetery as the \\"until the end of the 20th century the most visible material evidence for Julfa’s glorious Armenian past.\\" Destruction =Background= Two Julfa khachkars, dated 1602 and 1603, removed from the graveyard before its destruction and now on display at Echmiadzin, Armenia. Armenia first brought up charges against the Azerbaijani government for destroying khachkars in 1998 in the town of Julfa. Several years earlier, Armenia had supported the Armenians of Karabakh to fight for their independence in the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, in the Nagorno- Karabakh War. The war concluded in 1994 when a cease fire was signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh established the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, an internationally unrecognized but de facto independent state. Since the end of the war, enmity against Armenians in Azerbaijan has built up. Sarah Pickman, writing in Archaeology, noted that the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Armenians has \\"played a part in this attempt to eradicate the historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan.\\" In 1998, Azerbaijan dismissed Armenia's claims that the khachkars were being destroyed. Arpiar Petrosyan, a member of the organization Armenian Architecture in Iran, had initially pressed the claims after having witnessed and filmed bulldozers destroying the monuments. Hasan Zeynalov, the permanent representative of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (NAR) in Baku, stated that the Armenian allegation was \\"another dirty lie of the Armenians.\\" The government of Azerbaijan did not respond directly to the accusations but did state that \\"vandalism is not in the spirit of Azerbaijan.\\"\\"Azeris dismiss Iran's concern over Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan.\\" BBC News in BBC Monitoring Central Asia. December 11, 1998. Retrieved April 16, 2007 Armenia's claims provoked international scrutiny that, according to Armenian Minister of Culture Gagik Gyurdjian, helped to temporarily stop the destruction. Armenian archaeologists and experts on the khachkars in Nakhchivan stated that when they first visited the region in 1987, prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, the monuments had stood intact and the region itself had as many as \\"27,000 monasteries, churches, khachkars, tombstones\\" among other cultural artifacts. By 1998, the number of khachkars was reduced to 2,700.\\"Armenian intellectuals blast 'barbaric' destruction of Nakhchivan monuments.\\" BBC News in BBC Monitoring Central Asia. February 13, 2003. Retrieved April 16, 2007 The old cemetery of Julgha is known to specialists to have housed as many as 10,000 of these carved khachkar headstones, up to 2,000 of which were still intact after an earlier outbreak of vandalism on the same site in 2002. =Renewed claims in 2003= The destruction of Julfa cemetery by soldiers in 2006 In 2003, Armenians renewed their protests, claiming that Azerbaijan had restarted the destruction of the monuments. On December 4, 2002, Armenian historians and archaeologists met and filed a formal complaint and appealed to international organizations to investigate their claims. Eyewitness accounts of the ongoing demolition describe an organized operation. In December 2005, The Armenian Bishop of Tabriz, Nshan Topouzian, and other Iranian Armenians documented more video evidence across the Araks river, which partially demarcates the border between Nakhchivan and Iran, stating that it showed Azerbaijani troops had finished the destruction of the remaining khachkars by using sledgehammers and axes. International response Azerbaijan's government has faced a flurry of condemnation since the charges were first revealed. When the claims were first brought up in 1998, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ordered that the destruction of the monuments in Julfa cease. The complaints also brought forward similar appeals to end the activity by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). =Azerbaijan= In reaction to the charges brought forward by Armenia and international organizations, Azerbaijan has asserted that Armenians had never existed in those territories. In December 2005, Zeynalov stated in a BBC interview that Armenians \\"never lived in Nakhichivan, which has been Azerbaijani land from time immemorial, and that's why there are no Armenian cemeteries and monuments and have never been any.\\" Azerbaijan instead contends that the monuments were not of Armenian but of Caucasian Albanian origin. In regard to the destruction, according to the Azerbaijani Ambassador to the United States, Hafiz Pashayev, the videos and photographs that were introduced did not show the identity of the people nor display what they are actually destroying. Instead, the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan to draw attention away from the alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia.\\"Will the arrested minister become new leader of opposition? Azerbaijani press digest.\\" Regnum News Agency. January 20, 2006. Retrieved April 15, 2007. Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev also denied the charges, calling them \\"a lie and a provocation.\\" =European Union= In 2006, European parliamentary members protested to the Azerbaijani government when they were barred from inspecting the cemetery. Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian socialist MEP and committee member who was denied access to the region, commented that \\"If they do not allow us to go, we have a clear hint that something bad has happened. If something is hidden we want to ask why. It can only be because some of the allegations are true.\\" Doctor Charles Tannock, a conservative member of the European Parliament for Greater London, and others echoed those sentiments and compared the destruction to the Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban in Bamyan, Afghanistan in 2001. He cited in a speech a British architect, Steven Sim, an expert of the region, who attested that the video footage shot from the Iranian border was genuine.Dr Charles Tannock.

After several postponed visits, a renewed attempt was planned by inspectors of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for August 29 - September 6, 2007, led by the British Labour politician Edward O'Hara.

However, on August 28, the head of the Azerbaijani delegation to PACE released a demand that the inspectors must enter Nagorno Karabakh via Azerbaijan. On August 29, PACE Secretary General Mateo Sorinas announced that the visit had had to be canceled, because of the difficulty in accessing Nagorno-Karabagh using the route required by Azerbaijan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Armenia issued a statement saying that Azerbaijan had stopped the visit \\"due solely to their intent to veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan.\\"Vladimir Karapetian, Spokesperson of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responds to a question by “Armenpress” News Agency on the cancellation of the visit of the PACE subcommittee on cultural issues to the region from Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated August 29, 2007. =Iran= The government of Iran expressed concern over the destruction of the monuments and filed a protest against the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's government (NAR). =United States= In April 2011, the newly appointed United States ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza visited Nakhchivan but was inexplicably refused access to Julfa by Azerbaijani authorities.\\"U.S. Envoy Barred From Ancient Armenian Cemetery In Azerbaijan.\\" RFE/RL.

Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project In 2013 the Australian Catholic University together with Manning Clark House, Yerevan State University and the Armenian Apostolic Church of the Holy Resurrection in Sydney, began a project to create a digital reconstruction of the destroyed Julfa Cemetery. The project, led by Dr Judith Crispin and Prof. Harold Short, is using 3D visualisation and virtual reality techniques to create an immersive presentation of the medieval khachkars and ram-shaped stones set in the original location. Julfa project is the custodian of many historical photographs and maps of the Julfa cemetery, including those taken by Argam Ayvazyan over a 25-year period. Presentations of Julfa Project's early results were held in Rome during 2016. The project, which will run until 2020, will result in permanent installations in Yerevan and Sydney. Other notable scholars working on the Julfa Project include archaeologist Hamlet Petrosyan, cultural historian Dickran Kouymjian, 3D visualisation expert Drew Baker, and Julfa cemetery expert Simon Maghakyan. 2010 AAAS analysis of satellite photos As a response to Azerbaijan barring on-site investigation by outside groups, on December 8, 2010, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) released an analysis of high-resolution satellite photographs of the Julfa cemetery site taken in 2003 and 2009. The AAAS concluded that the satellite imagery was consistent with the reports from observers on the ground, that \\"significant destruction and changes in the grade of the terrain\\" had occurred between 2003 and 2009, and that the cemetery area was \\"likely destroyed and later leveled by earth-moving equipment.\\" Criticism of international reaction Armenian journalist Haykaram Nahapetyan compared the destruction of the cemetery with the destruction of cultural heritage by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan by the Taliban. He also criticized the international community's response to the destruction of the cemetery in Julfa. Simon Maghakyan noted the West condemned the Taliban destruction of the Buddhas and the Islamist destruction of shrines in Timbuktu during the 2012 Northern Mali conflict because \\"the violators of cultural rights in both instances are anti-Western, al-Qaeda-linked groups, and that alone seems to have merited the strong Western condemnation.\\" He added, \\"otherwise, why has the West maintained its overwhelming silence regarding the complete destruction of the world’s largest medieval Armenian cemetery by Azerbaijan, a major energy supplier to, and arms purchaser from, the West?\\"  Remaining khachkars  ;Julfa khachkars at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral Image:2014 Prowincja Armawir, Wagharszapat, Chaczkar z 1576 roku ze zniszczonego cmentarza w Dżulfie.JPGc. 1576 Image:2014 Prowincja Armawir, Wagharszapat, Chaczkar z 1602 roku ze zniszczonego cmentarza w Dżulfie.JPGc. 1602 Image:Khatchkar from Jugha-2.jpg16th century Image:Khatchkar from Jugha.jpg16th century Image:Khachkar from Old Djugha 1602 img 6933.jpgc. 1602 =Replicas= File:Geghard khachkars.jpgat the Geghard monastery File:Geghard Julfa khachkar copy1.jpgat Geghard File:Geghard Julfa khachkar copy2.jpgat Geghard File:Copies of Julfa khachkar.jpgat the Saint John the Baptist Church in Yerevan File:Copy of Julfa khachkar.jpgat St. John Church in Yerevan File:Copy of Julfa khachkar2.jpgat St. John Church in Yerevan See also *Buddhas of Bamiyan *Mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar *Sultanim cemetery Notes Further reading * Ayvazyan, Argam.

During his lifetime, Roman was active inside the Romanian, Czechoslovakian, French, and Spanish Communist partiesMihailov as well as being a Comintern cadre. He started his military career as a volunteer in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, and rose to prominence in Communist Romania, as a high-level politician and military official. Valter was the father of Petre Roman, a post-1989 politician, who served as Prime Minister.

Katowski.Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.320 Wounded twice during combat, Roman eventually left for the Soviet Union. In 1938-1941, Roman worked at a plane factory in Kalinin, later for one of the Comintern sections, and, during World War II, for an Institute for Scientific Research (1941–1945). During the period, he married Hortensia Vallejo, who was originally from Santander, Spain.El País At the time, Roman also headed the Romanian-language radio station of the Comintern (România Liberă), broadcasting propaganda against the regime of Ion Antonescu and Romania's actions on the Eastern Front as an ally of Nazi Germany (see Romania during World War II).Final Report, p.45, 60; Roman in Sfera Politicii, Part I; Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.124, 163 He returned to Soviet-occupied Romania in July 1945, as the political commissar for the Soviet-organized Horia, Cloşca şi Crişan Division, commanded by General Mihail Lascăr. Under the communist regime, Roman became a general in the Romanian Army (Major General after May 1, 1948) with political responsibilities (Chief of the Army Directorate for Education, Culture, and Propaganda, 1946; Chief of the Superior Political Direction of the Romanian Army and Chief of Staff, 1947–1951), and Minister of Telecommunications (March 29, 1951 – January 24, 1953).Final Report, p.45; Levy, p.161; Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.124, 320 At the time, he declared himself in favor of recruiting a new military force \\"from the ranks of the working class, of the toiling peasantry and of the progressive intelligentsia\\".Roman, in Corlăţan Close to the Ana Pauker \\"Muscovite wing\\" of the PCR,Final Report, p.59; Roman in Sfera Politicii, Part I; Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.162, 163 he came into conflict with the party leadership around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

He spent late October in Budapest, sending back reports which inflamed sentiments by presenting alleged revolutionary violence.Tismăneanu, Gheorghiu-Dej and the Romanian Workers' Party, p.20 After the Red Army invaded Hungary, he accompanied Gheorghiu-Dej, the writer Mihai Beniuc, and other local Communists to Budapest, where the three of them reviewed the situation and expressed approval of Soviet policies.Final Report, p.77; Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.338 Later on, he was involved in interrogating Imre Nagy during his detainment in Snagov, while also ensuring contacts between Nagy and Soviet officials.Final Report, p.77-78; Tismăneanu, Gheorghiu-Dej and the Romanian Workers' Party, p.22; Stalinism, p.192, 338 Nagy was returned to Hungary, secretly tried and executed.

At the time, he argued that Pauker and her collaborator Vasile Luca had viewed him with suspicion based on his participation in the Spanish Civil War. After Gheorghiu-Dej's death, he approved of the change in course indicated by Nicolae Ceauşescu, and joined in condemning the 1968 Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia (at the time, he notably quoted Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea's statement that \\"socialism and truth are inseparable\\").Final Report, p.105; Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.347 Elected to the Central Committee on July 24, 1965, he was in office until his death.Final Report, p.45; Tismăneanu, Stalinism, p.124, 239 Decorated a Hero of the Socialist Labor, Roman was also employed as a University professor. By the 1970s, he was becoming opposed to the Ceauşescu leadership and questioned Leninism itself; a diary entry of 1975 shows that he resented the massive enrollment of obedient cadres into the PCR,Cioroianu, p.414-415 and speculated that \\"when Lenin elaborated the concept of the new-type party he took inspiration from, he also thought of Ignacio de Loyola, of his «company of Jesus», of what it represented from the point of view of discipline, of obedience, hence there later emerged many negative consequences and, first of all, the deterioration of human character, of human integrity\\".Roman, in Cioroianu, p.415 Controversies Several aspects of Roman's past remain under dispute. In 2000, investigations by Russian historian Tofik Islamov concluded that, after Soviet authorities charged Maxim Litvinov to investigate the issue of Northern Transylvania, disputed between Romania and Hungary, Roman approached the commission in late 1944 with plans to have Transylvania declare itself independent (under a common guarantee from the Soviets and Western Allies).Vohn Petre Roman has repeatedly contested the conclusion, advancing documents which, he argued, proved that his father was in favor of Transylvania's status inside Romania. In his own reply to Petre Roman's arguments, Islamov repeated his statements, and contended that views such as those attributed to Valter Roman were commonplace among internationalists of the time.Islamov He also cited Valter Roman's own 1944 statement -- according to the document, Roman viewed both Hungary and Romania as guilty of waging war on the Soviet Union, arguing that the region (Transylvania) was \\"an ethnographic conglomerate\\" with a tradition of regional sovereignty, economic independence, and status as \\"the most progressive part of the country\\". In 2006, Petre Roman was involved in a polemic with former Securitate chief and defector Ion Mihai Pacepa over the extent to which Valter Roman took part in political repression in the wake of the Hungarian Revolution.Pacepa Works =Essays= *Revoluţia industrială în dezvoltarea societăţii (\\"The Industrial Revolution in Social Development\\") *Eseuri despre revoluţia ştiinţifică şi tehnică (\\"Essays on the Scientific and Technical Revolution\\") =Memoir= *Sub cerul Spaniei (\\"Under the Skies of Spain\\") Notes References * Valter Roman's speech and subsequent exchange of replies with other Communist leaders (December 1961), at Sfera Politicii: Part I, Part II * \\"Roman llega hoy a Madrid para impulsar las relaciones entre España y Rumanía\\" (\\"Roman Arrives Today in Madrid to Revive Relations between Spain and Romania\\"), in El País, January 16, 1990 * Final Report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania * Vartan Arachelian, \\"Falsificatorii\\" (\\"The Forgers\\"), in Ziua, August 23, 2005 *Adrian Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx.

Founded as the New Democratic Party of Quebec [Nouveau Parti Démocratique du Québec (NPDQ)], the NPDQ was originally affiliated with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) but separated from the NDP in 1989 before disaffiliating entirely in 1991. A new section of the federal NDP, called New Democratic Party of Canada - Québec Section was refounded in 1990, and is active only in federal politics. History The PDS' roots can be traced to 1939, with the founding of the Fédération du Commonwealth Coopératif (FCC), later renamed Parti social démocratique du Québec (PSD) in 1955. The FCC/PSD was the Quebec counterpart of Canada's federal Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party. After the CCF became the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961, the NPDQ was created in 1963 following the concerted efforts of the Quebec Federation of Labour (Fédération des travailleurs du Québec) (FTQ) and of the Quebec section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), which had been known as the Parti social démocratique du Québec (PSD) since 1955. On the federal level, in its role as the Quebec section of the NDP, the NPDQ contested the Canadian federal elections between 1962 and 1988. Until the end of the 1960s, in conformity with the division of roles that had been decided in 1963, the NPDQ was active exclusively on the federal political level in Quebec. This left the provincial political level to the pro-independence Parti socialiste du Québec, PSQ) led by former PSD leader Michel Chartrand. After the disappearance of the PSQ around 1968, the NPDQ continued to concentrate most of its attention on the federal level during the 1970s and the early 1980s. It made a few incursions on the provincial level, running a few candidates, first in the Quebec general election of 1970, and later in the general election of 1976, the second time as part of a coalition with the Regroupement des militants syndicaux (RMS). The provincial party became defunct following leader Henri-François Gautrin's resignation in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the federal NDP's Quebec section determined that there was a new political vacuum in Quebec politics and that, in addition to its role in federal politics, the time had come for the NPDQ to return to the provincial scene. The NPDQ registered as a political party in Quebec in 1985 and selected Jean-Paul Harney as leader. It ran in the general elections in 1985, 1989 and 1994. In 1989, the NPDQ voted to disaffiliate from the federal NDP as a result of policy differences, such as the provincial party's opposition to the Meech Lake Accord; its support for Quebec's language policy; differences with the federal party over the Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement; and its more favourable position towards Quebec nationalism.Picard, André, \\"Quebec NDP opts for autonomy,\\" Globe and Mail, May 1, 1989Canadian Press, \\"Federal NDP breaks with Quebec wing,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, March 13, 1991 As a result, the NPDQ concentrated its activities on the Quebec provincial political level, and its members became free to adhere to any federal political party. Similarly, the federal NDP directed its activities in Quebec exclusively on the federal political level, through its Quebec branch renamed the New Democratic Party of Canada (Quebec Section), which runs candidates only in federal elections and whose members became free to adhere to any provincial political party in Quebec. Practically, this brought the situation back to what it had been between 1963 and 1968, but with the difference that the NPDQ, which after the first division of 1963 had ended up being an organization centred on federal politics, now ended up being an organization centred on provincial politics after the second division of 1989. During this time, the party came under the influence of sovereigntists. Tensions between the provincial and federal parties came to a head in 1990 when the NPDQ announced its support for Gilles Duceppe's candidacy as a Bloc Québécois candidate in a federal by-election and urged federal NDP candidate Louise O'Neill to withdraw from the contest so as not to split the vote.Morin, Eloise, \\"NDP candidate urged to quit\\", Toronto Star, July 26, 1990 As a result, the federal party voted to sever its \\"fraternal ties\\" to its former provincial wing and the provincial party was encouraged to change its name.York, Geoffrey, \\"NDP breaks link to Quebec wing Alignment with Bloc Quebecois brings split with federal party,\\" Globe and Mail, March 12, 1991 The federal NDP denounced the provincial party when it nominated former Front de libération du Québec member Paul Rose as a candidate in a provincial by- election. Rose had been convicted for his role in the murder of Pierre Laporte during the 1970 October Crisis. The federal NDP announced that they were seeking legal means to force the NPDQ to stop calling using the name \\"New Democratic\\".Harper, Tim, \\"Quebec NDP outrages McLaughlin,\\" Toronto Star, December 12, 1991Canadian Press, \\"McLaughlin distances party from ex- terrorist,\\" Hamilton Spectator, December 12, 1991 After the general election of 1994, the NPDQ decided to change its name to Parti de la Democratie Socialiste (PDS). Rose was elected its leader two years later. Under this new name, the PDS contested the general election of 1998. In 2002, the PDS became a part of the left-wing coalition Union des forces progressistes (UFP; Union of Progressive Forces), together with the Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste (RAP; Union for a Progressive Alternative) and the Communist Party of Quebec. As a consequence, the PDS withdrew its official party registration with the chief electoral officer and participated under the UFP banner in the Quebec general election of 2003. In 2006, the UFP merged with Option citoyenne to form Québec solidaire. It remains an organized tendency within the new coalition under the name \\"Québec socialiste\\". Québec solidaire contested the 2007 general election and won its first seat in the National Assembly in 2008. In 2014, supporters of the federal NDP founded a new New Democratic Party of Quebec (NPDQ) which intends to stand candidates in the 2018 provincial election.

Footballer  McMurray was born in Port Melbourne, Victoria in 1889. His father, Arch, played for Port Melbourne Football Club and South Melbourne Football Club during the 1880s. He also represented Victoria. Jack showed a keen interest in football. He began umpiring in the South Suburban competition aged 16, but the next year decided that he wanted to play, so joined the Rosedale juniors at Port Melbourne. He found the going tough by virtue of his very slight physique (155 cm and 50 kg) and in 1908 he returned to umpiring and officiated in the Metropolitan Junior Association.  VFA umpire  Three years later, his progression found him umpiring in the Victorian Junior Association and in 1913 he was appointed to the Victorian Football Association (VFA). In 1914 he handled the First Semi-Final and two weeks later the Grand Final between North Melbourne and Footscray. In 1915 he umpired through the home and away season but could not dislodge Tom Kendall who umpired all three finals matches that year.  VFL umpire  With the VFA competition suspended during World War I, he moved to the rival Victorian Football League (VFL) (the VFL renamed Australian Football League (AFL) in 1991). In 1917 he umpired his first match, Fitzroy versus Richmond, at the Brunswick Street Oval, on Monday 4 June 1917. In June 1920 he umpired the rest of the season in the seniors and becoming a first choice umpire. His first significant matches were the 1921 finals series, where he umpired three of the four finals, Jack Elder being appointed to the Second Semi-Final. McMurray now established himself as 'the' umpire of the period, having almost a monopoly on finals, interstate and carnival matches. He was in charge of the first half of the only match ever between the VFL and VFA Premiers. Played in 1924, after a particularly unsuccessful League final series experiment, Footscray defeated Essendon and McMurray shared duties with the VFA's representative James Leheny.  NTFA umpire In 1929 the Great Depression led McMurray to accept an offer from the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA). He was appointed to umpire for £15 a week (at the time the highest fee ever paid). Contemporary reports stated that his excellent decision making, consistency and strong control did much to improve the standard of play in Tasmania. He returned to Melbourne at the end of the season and was immediately reappointed to the VFL for 1930.  Haydn Bunton  One famous incident in McMurray's career involved the great Haydn Bunton Sr. In 1934, Bunton dominated the last game of the season and as he walked off the ground he made a flippant remark to McMurray, along the lines of: \\"That wasn't bad today, Jack.\\" \\"Never try to bribe an umpire,\\" McMurray apparently replied - and left him out of the votes. Bunton lost the medal to Dick Reynolds by one vote that season.  Senior career  In August 1936, 20 seasons after his first VFL match, McMurray became the first umpire to officiate in 300 VFL matches. He eventually retired from VFL umpiring at the end of that season having umpired a total of 307 matches (including 4 as a boundary umpire), 23 finals (including 5 Grand Finals) and a record 15 Interstate appointments. He umpired one final season in the country leagues and at the end of 1937, aged 47, left the field for good.  Honours  He was made a life-member of the League in 1980 matching his 1933 Life Membership of the VFL Umpires Association. McMurray was further recognised by the awarding of the Jack McMurray Scholarships. These were presented to the best two first year umpires on the Cadet Squad list each year between and 1987 and 1991 by the then VFL Commission. McMurray was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996. His son Jack McMurray Jr. was also a highly respected umpire, inducted into the Hall of Fame.  References  * Ross, J.

The gastropod shell is part of the body of a gastropod or snail, a kind of mollusc. The shell is an exoskeleton, which protects from predators, mechanical damage, and dehydration, but also serves for muscle attachment and calcium storage. Some gastropods appear shell-less (slugs) but may have a remnant within the mantle, or the shell is reduced such that the body cannot be retracted within (semi-slug). Some snails also possess an operculum that seals the opening of the shell, known as the aperture, which provides further protection. The study of mollusc shells is known as conchology. The biological study of gastropods, and other molluscs in general, is malacology. Shell morphology terms vary by species group. An excellent source for terminology of the gastropod shell is \\"How to Know the Eastern Land Snails\\" by John B. Burch now freely available at the Hathi Trust Digital Library.  Shell layers  The gastropod shell has three major layers secreted by the mantle. The calcareous central layer, tracum, is typically made of calcium carbonate precipitated into an organic matrix known as conchiolin. The outermost layer is the periostracum which is resistant to abrasion and provides most shell coloration. The body of the snail contacts the innermost smooth layer that may be composed of mother-of-pearl or shell nacre, a dense horizontally packed form of conchiolin, which is layered upon the periostracum as the snail grows.  Morphology  { align=center cellspacing=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"25\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - align=center 500px style=\\"background: black\\" 180px -valign=top Morphology of typical spirally coiled shell. The shell of Zonitoides nitidus, a land snail, has dextral coiling. Upper image: Dorsal view, showing whorls and apex Central image: Lateral view showing the profile of the shell Lower image: Basal view showing umbilicus in the centre. Photo of the shell of Zonitoides nitidus with an apical view, an apertural view and a basal view } Gastropod shell morphology is usually quite constant among individuals of a species. Controlling variables are: * The rate of growth per revolution around the coiling axis. High rates give wide-mouthed forms such as the abalone, low rates give highly coiled forms such as Turritella or some of the Planorbidae. * The shape of the generating curve, roughly equivalent to the shape of the aperture. It may be round, for instance in the turban shell, elongate as in the cone shell or have an irregular shape with a siphonal canal extension, as in the Murex. * The rate of translation of the generating curve along the axis of coiling, controlling how high-spired the resulting shell becomes. This may range from zero, a flat planispiral shell, to nearly the diameter of the aperture. * Irregularities or \\"sculpturing\\" such as ribs, spines, knobs, and varices made by the snail regularly changing the shape of the generating curve during the course of growth, for instance in the many species of Murex. * Ontologic growth changes as the animal reaches adulthood. Good examples are the flaring lip of the adult conch and the inward-coiled lip of the cowry. Some of these factors can be modelled mathematically and programs exist to generate extremely realistic images. Early work by David Raup on the analog computer also revealed many possible combinations that were never adopted by any actual gastropod. Some shell shapes are found more often in certain environments, though there are many exceptions. Wave-washed high-energy environments, such as the rocky intertidal zone, are usually inhabited by snails whose shells have a wide aperture, a relatively low surface area, and a high growth rate per revolution. High-spired and highly sculptured forms become more common in quiet water environments. The shell of burrowing forms, such as the olive and Terebra, are smooth, elongated, and lack elaborate sculpture, in order to decrease resistance when moving through sand. On land, high-spired forms are often associated with vertical surfaces, whereas flat-shelled snails tend to live on the ground. A few gastropods, for instance the Vermetidae, cement the shell to, and grow along, solid surfaces such as rocks, or other shells. Chirality Most gastropod shells are spirally coiled. The majority (over 90%)Schilthuizen M. & Davison A. (2005). \\"The convoluted evolution of snail chirality\\". Naturwissenschaften 92(11): 504–515. . . of gastropod species have dextral (right-handed) shells, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always sinistral (left-handed), and a very few species (for example Amphidromus perversus) show a mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals. There occur also aberrantly sinistral forms of dextral species and some of these are highly sought by shell collectors. The left-handed turrid (Antiplanes vinosa) If a coiled gastropod shell is held with the spire pointing upwards and the aperture more or less facing the observer, a dextral shell will have the aperture on the right-hand side, and a sinistral shell will have the aperture on the left-hand side. This chirality of gastropods is sometimes overlooked when photographs of coiled gastropods are \\"flipped\\" by a non-expert prior to being used in a publication. This image \\"flipping\\" results in a normal dextral gastropod appearing to be a rare or abnormal sinistral one. Sinistrality arose independently 19 times among marine gastropods since the start of the Cenozoic.Geerat Vermeij (2002). \\"The Geography of Evolutionary Opportunity: Hypothesis and Two Cases in Gastropods\\". Integrative and Comparative Biology 42(5): 9359–40. . This left-handedness seems to be more common in freshwater and land pulmonates. But still the dextral living species in gastropods seem to account for 99% of the total number.Asami, T. (1993) \\"Genetic variation of coiling chirality in snails\\". Forma, 8, 263–276 The chirality in gastropods appears in early cleavage (spiral cleavage) and the gene NODAL is involved.Myers P. Z. (13 April 2009) \\"Snails have nodal!\\". The Panda's Thumb, accessed 3 May 2009. A more recent study (2013) correlates the asymmetric coiling of the shell by the left-right asymmetric expression of the decapentaplegic gene in the mantle.Keisuke Shimizu, Minoru Iijima, Davin HE SetiamargaIsao Sarashina, Tetsuhiro Kudoh, Takahiro Asami, Edi Gittenberger, Kazuyoshi Endo; \\"Left-right asymmetric expression of dpp in the mantle of gastropods correlates with asymmetric shell coiling.\\" EvoDevo 2013, 4:15. . = Mixed coiling populations = In a few cases, both left- and right-handed coiling are found in the same population. Sinistral mutants of normally dextral species and dextral mutants of normally sinistral species are rare but well documented occurrences among land snails in general. Populations or species with normally mixed coiling are much rarer, and, so far as is known, are confined, with one exception, to a few genera of arboreal tropical snails. Besides Amphidromus, the Cuban Liguus vittatus (Swainson), Haitian Liguus virgineus (Linnaeus) (family Orthalicidae), some Hawaiian Partulina and many Hawaiian Achatinella (family Achatinellidae), as well as several species of Pacific islands Partula (family Partulidae), are known to have mixed dextral-sinistral populations. A possible exception may concern some of the European clausiliids of the subfamily Alopiinae. They are obligatory calciphiles living in isolated colonies on limestone outcrops. Several sets of species differ only in the direction of coiling, but the evidence is inconclusive as to whether left- and right-handed shells live together. Soos (1928, pp. 372–385) summarized previous discussions of the problem and concluded that the right- and left-handed populations were distinct species. Others have stated that these populations were not distinct, and the question is far from settled. The Peruvian clausiliid, Nenia callistoglypta Pilsbry (1949, pp. 216–217), also has been described as being an amphidromine species. The genetics of reverse coiling in a rare dextral mutant of another clausiliid, Alinda biplicata (Montagu), has been studied by Degner (1952). The mechanism is the same as in Radix peregra (Müller), with the direction of coiling determined by a simple Mendelian recessive.  Standard ways of viewing a shell  File:Valvata sincera shell lateral.jpgApertural view of shell of Valvata sincera File:Valvata sincera shell 2.jpgAbapertural view of shell of Valvata sincera File:Valvata sincera shell basal.jpgUmbilical view of shell of Valvata sincera File:Calliostoma bairdii drawing.jpgThis dorsal view of the living animal Calliostoma bairdii also shows an apical view of its shell In photographs or illustrations, a gastropod shell can be shown oriented in a number of standard ways: * apertural view: this is the most common viewing angle. The shell is shown in its entirety, with its aperture facing the viewer, and the apex at the top. If the aperture is on the right side when viewed like this, then the shell-coiling is \\"right-handed\\" or dextral; if the aperture is on the left side when viewed like this, the shell has \\"left-handed\\" or sinistral shell-coiling. * abapertural view (or dorsal view): the shell is shown with its aperture 180° away from the viewer, and with the apex at the top. * umbilical view (or basal view): the shell is shown viewed directly from below. In most cases where there is an umbilicus, this is in clear view. * apical view: the shell is shown looking down directly onto the apex.  Description  Spiral tower shell of Epitonium scalare. The shell begins with the larval shell, the (usually) minute embryonic whorls known as the protoconch, which is often quite distinct from the rest of the shell and has no growth lines. From the protoconch, which forms the apex of the spire, the coils or whorls of the shell gradually increase in size. Normally the whorls are circular or elliptical in section. The spire can be high or low, broad or slender, according to the way the coils of the shell are arranged, and the apical angle of the shell varies accordingly. The whorls sometimes rest loosely upon one another (as in Epitonium scalare). They also can overlap the earlier whorls such that the earlier whorls may be largely or wholly covered by the later ones. When an angulation occurs, the space between it and the suture above it constitutes the area known as the \\"shoulder\\" of the shell. The shoulder angle may be smooth or keeled, and may sometimes have nodes or spines. The most simple form of sculpture of the gastropod shell consists of longitudinal ridges, and/or transverse ridges. Primary spirals may appear in regular succession on either side of the first primary, which generally becomes the shoulder angle if angulation occurs. Secondary spirals may appear by intercalation between the primary ones, and generally are absent in the young shell, except in some highly accelerated types. Tertiary spirals are intercalated between the preceding groups in more specialized species. Ribs are regular transverse foldings of the shell, which generally extend from the suture to suture. They are usually spaced uniformly and crossed by the spirals. In specialized types, when a shoulder angle is formed, they become concentrated as nodes upon this angle, disappearing from the shoulder above and the body below. Spines may replace the nodes in later stages. They form as notches in the margin of the shell and are subsequently abandoned, often remaining open in front. Irregular spines may also arise on various parts of the surface of the shell (see Platyceras). When a row of spines is formed at the edge or outer lip of the shell during a resting period, this feature sometimes remains behind as a varix as in (Murex) and many of the Ranellidae. Varices may also be formed by simple expansion of the outer lip, and a subsequent resumption of growth from the base of the expansion. The aperture or peristome of the shell may be simple or variously modified. An outer and an inner (columellar) lip are generally recognized. These may be continuous with each other, or may be divided by an anterior notch. This, in some types (Fusinus, etc.) it is drawn out into an anterior siphonal canal, of greater or lesser length. An upper or posterior notch is present in certain taxa, and this may result in the formation of a ridge or shelf next to the suture (Clavilithes). An outer (lateral) emargination or notch, sometimes prolonged into a slit occurs in certain types (Pleurotomidae, Pleurotomaridae, Bellerophontidae, etc.), and the progressive closing of this slit may give rise to a definitely marked slit band. In some cases the slit is abandoned and left as a hole (Fissurellidae), or by periodic renewal as a succession of holes (Haliotis). The outer emargination is often only indicated by the reflected course of the lines of growth on the shell. On the inside of the outer lip, various ridges or plications called lirae are sometimes found, and these occasionally may be strong and tooth-like (Nerinea). Similar ridges or columellar plicae or folds are more often found on the inner lip, next to the columella or central spiral twist. These may be oblique or normal to the axis of coiling (horizontal), few or numerous, readily seen, or far within the shell so as to be invisible except in broken shells. When the axis of coiling is hollow (perforate spire) the opening at the base constitutes the umbilicus. The umbilicus varies greatly in size, and may be wholly or in part covered by an expansion or callus of the inner lip (Natica). Many Recent shells, when the animal is alive or the shell is freshly empty, have an uppermost shell layer of horny, smooth, or hairy epidermis or periostracum, a proteinaceous layer which sometimes is thick enough to hide the color markings of the surface of the shell. The periostracum, as well as the coloration, is only rarely preserved in fossil shells. The apertural end of the gastropod shell is the anterior end, nearest to the head of the animal; the apex of the spire is often the posterior end or at least is the dorsal side. Most authors figure the shells with the apex of the spire uppermost. In life, when the soft parts of these snail are retracted, in some groups the aperture of the shell is closed by using a horny or calcareous operculum, a door-like structure which is secreted by, and attached to, the upper surface of the posterior part of the foot. The operculum is of very variable form in the different groups of snails that possess one.  Parts of the shell  A drawing of an abnormal scalarid form of the shell of the garden snail, Cornu aspersum The terminology used to describe the shells of gastropods includes: * Aperture: the opening of the shell * Lip: peristome: the margin of the aperture * Apex: the smallest few whorls of the shell * Body whorl (or last whorl): the largest whorl in which the main part of the visceral mass of the mollusk is found * Columella: the \\"little column\\" at the axis of revolution of the shell * Operculum: the \\"trapdoor\\" of the shell * Parietal callus: a ridge on the inner lip of the aperture in certain gastropods * Periostracum: a thin layer of organic \\"skin\\" which forms the outer layer of the shell of many species * Peristome: the part of the shell that is right around the aperture, also known as the lip * Plait: folds on the columella. * Protoconch: the nuclear or embryonic whorl; the larval shell, often remains in position even on an adult shell * Sculpture: ornamentation on the outer surface of a shell ** Lira: raised lines or ridges on the surface of the shell * Siphonal canal: an extension of the aperture in certain gastropods * Spire: the part of the shell above the body whorl. * Suture: The junction between whorls of most gastropods * Teleoconch : the entire shell without the protoconch; the postnuclear whorls. * Umbilicus: in shells where the whorls move apart as they grow, on the underside of the shell there is a deep depression reaching up towards the spire; this is the umbilicus * Varix: on some mollusk shells, spaced raised and thickened vertical ribs mark the end of a period of rapid growth; these are varices * Whorl: each one of the complete rotations of the shell spiral  Shape of the shell  The overall shape of the shell varies. For example, three groups can be distinguished based on the height – width ratio:Falkner G., Obrdlík P., Castella E. & Speight M. C. D. (2001). Shelled Gastropoda of Western Europe. München: Friedrich-Held-Gesellschaft, 267 pp. * oblong – the height is much bigger than the width * globose or conical shell – the height and the width of the shell are approximately the same * depressed – the width is much bigger than the height File:Bulgarica denticulata shell.pngoblong shell of Bulgarica denticulata File:Sphincterochila candidissima.jpgglobose shell of Sphincterochila candidissima File:Elona quimperiana shell 2.jpgdepressed shell of Escargot de Quimper The following are the principal modifications of form in the gastropod shell.George Washington Tryon, Structural and systematic conchology, 1882, pp. 43–44 * Regularly spiral: ** Bulloid: bubble-shaped Bulla ** Coeloconoid a slightly concave conical shell in which the incremental angle increases steadily during growth (see: Calliostoma) ** Cone-shaped, obconic.

Dotted lines represent the orientation axes (except of lower image).  Dimensions  The most frequently used measurements of a gastropod shell are: the height of the shell, the width of the shell, the height of the aperture and the width of the aperture. The number of whorls is also often used. In this context, the height (or the length) of a shell is its maximum measurement along the central axis. The width (or breadth, or diameter) is the maximum measurement of the shell at right angles to the central axis. Both terms are only related to the description of the shell and not to the orientation of the shell on the living animal. The largest height of any shell is found in the marine snail species Syrinx aruanus, which can be up to 91 cm.Wells F. E., Walker D. I. & Jones D. S. (eds.)

Western Australian Museum, Perth. The central axis is an imaginary axis along the length of a shell, around which, in a coiled shell, the whorls spiral. The central axis passes through the columella, the central pillar of the shell.  Evolutionary changes  Among proposed roles invoked for the variability of shells during evolution include mechanical stability,Britton J.

The shells of some gastropods have been reduced or partly reduced during their evolution. This reduction can be seen in all slugs, in semi-slugs and in various other marine and non-marine gastropods. Sometimes the reduction of the shell is associated with a predatory way of feeding. Some taxa lost the coiling of their shell during evolution. According to Dollo's law, it is not possible to regain the coiling of the shell after it is lost. Despite that, there are few genera in the family Calyptraeidae that changed their developmental timing (heterochrony) and gained back (re-evolution) a coiled shell from the previous condition of an uncoiled limpet-like shell.Collin R. & Cipriani R. (22 December 2003) \\"Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society B 270(1533): 2551–2555. .  Taphonomic implications  In large enough quantities, gastropod shells can have enough of an impact on environmental conditions to affect the ability of organic remains in the local environment to fossilize. For example, in the Dinosaur Park Formation, fossil hadrosaur eggshell is rare. This is because the breakdown of tannins from local coniferous vegetation would have caused the ancient waters to become acidic. Eggshell fragments are present in only two microfossil sites, both of which are predominated by the preserved shells of invertebrate life, including gastropods. It was the slow dissolution of these shells releasing calcium carbonate into the water that raised the water's pH high enough to prevent the eggshell fragments from dissolving before they could be fossilized.Tanke, D.H. and Brett-Surman, M.K. 2001.

As a painter, he is notable for his membership in the Kapist movement, which was heavily influenced by Cézanne. Following the Polish Defensive War, he was made a prisoner of war by the Soviets and was among the very few officers to survive the Katyn massacre of 1940. Following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, he was an official envoy of the Polish government searching for the missing Polish officers in Russia. After World War II, he remained in exile in the Paris suburb of Maisons-Laffitte, where he was among the founders of Kultura monthly, one of the most influential Polish cultural journals of the 20th century.  Life  =Early life= Leliwa Józef Marian Franciszek hrabia Hutten-Czapski of Leliwa, as was his full name, was born on 3 April 1896 in Prague, to an aristocratic family. Among his relatives were hr. Emeryk Hutten- Czapski, hr. Karol Hutten-Czapski , hr. Emeryk August Hutten-Czapski, his sister Maria Czapska, as well as Georgy Chicherin. Czapski spent most of his childhood in his family's manor of Przyłuki near Minsk. In 1915 he graduated from a gymnasium in St. Petersburg and joined the cadet corps. Czapski graduated from the law faculty of the University of Saint Petersburg, and in 1917 both joined and later resigned from the 1st Krechowce Uhlan Regiment, a Polish cavalry unit formed in Russia as part of the Polish I Corps. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 he moved to newly-renascent Poland and in 1918 entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. There he started his studies in the class of Stanisław Lentz. However, already in 1920 he quit the academy and volunteered for the Polish Army. =Polish-Soviet War= An ardent pacifist, Czapski asked for any service that would not involve active struggle. His plea was accepted and he was sent to Russia with a mission of finding the whereabouts of the officers of Czapski's former regiment, taken captive by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War. He reached St. Petersburg, where he met, among others, Dmitry Filosofov, Zinaida Gippius, Aleksey Remizov and Dmitry Merezhkovsky who later became his long-time friend. His mission was concluded when he found out that the officers had been executed by the Bolsheviks. Under Merezhkovsky's influence Czapski gave up his pacifist ideals and, upon his return to Poland, joined the ranks of the Polish Army and fought as a NCO in the crew of one of the armoured trains on the fronts of the Polish-Soviet War. For his merits he was awarded the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military decoration. =Paris Committee and Second World War= In 1921, Czapski entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, where he was taught by Wojciech Weiss and Józef Pankiewicz. Moving away from the classical tradition, he moved to Paris in 1924 where he helped to develop the Komitet Paryski (Paris Committee, subsequently abbreviated to the 'Kapist' movement). Czapski began to hold exhibitions of his work but, encouraged by Ludwik Hering, increasingly moved to becoming a critic, writing essays on art, literature, and philosophy. He returned to Poland in 1932, re-enlisting in 1939. He was subsequently captured by the Russians and held in prison and labour camps; he was one of 395 who avoided the fate of more than 20,000 murdered at Katyn and similar massacres. After the 1941 German invasion of Russia and signing the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, Czapski joined the Polish II Corps under the command of General Anders. Between 1941 and 1942, Czapski was tasked with investigating the disappearance of Poles who had been in the captivity of the NKVD and subsequently massacred. He never received any satisfactory answers as to the fate of these men, but wrote about his experiences in two books, Reminiscences of Starobyelsk (1944), later also translated to French as: and The Inhuman Land (1949). During that period Czapski also met Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy and Anna Akhmatova who is said to have dedicated one of her poems to him. Anders subsequently removed his army through the Persian Corridor, and in Baghdad Czapski began writing for the Polish army newspapers Orzeł Biały ('White Eagle') and Kurier Polski ('Polish Courier'). = Emigration = Czapski shortly before his death, pictured on the cover of Tumult i olśnienia (Uproar and Enlightenments, originally published in French as Lumières de Joseph Czapski) Czapski ended the war in Rome, and moved to France in 1946. Together with Maria Czapska, Gustaw Herling-Grudziński and Jerzy Giedroyc, he established the Instytut Literacki (Literary Institute) at Maisons-Laffitte, where he lived until his death, and contributed to the Polish émigré literary journal 'Kultura'.He published also in the French press, including „Le Figaro Littéraire”, „Preuves”, „Gavroche”, „Nova et Vettera”, „Carrefour”. He co-organized Congress for Cultural Freedomy in Berlin (1950). His paintings were exhibited in France, Switzerland, Great Britain, Brazil and Belgium. His works were virtually inaccessible in Poland – after Polish October he had 1957 exhibitions in National Museum in Poznań and Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, but the next one was held only in 1986 in Warsaw. He signed a letter of Polish émigré writers who supported the Letter of 59.Kultura 1976/03/342 Paryż 1976, s. 34. Polish People's Republic censored information about Czapski and had his name on a list of the people completely banned from publication. His literary and artistic works were popularized in Poland only after 1989. Czapski died 12 January 1993, and three days later was buried on a cemetery in Le Mesnil-le-Roi, by the side of his sister Maria, who died in 1981. Czapski was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari (1918–1920) and the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1990). = Private life = Czapski was deeply Catholic, and his faith influenced his works and personal philosophy, but also his struggles with sexuality. In the years 1924-1926 he entered a relationship with a poet Sergey Nabokov, younger brother of Vladimir Nabokov; it was ended by Czapski's departure to London, in order to cure his typhoid fever. Returning to Poland, Czapski met the writer Ludwik Hering. The pair lived together for a few years in Józefów, and despite the fact that they were separated by World War 2 and subsequent emigration of Czapski, they maintained the love and friendship for years by exchanging letters. English translation The Inhuman Land is the first work of Czapski's translated into English and was published in London in 1951. Because it is a first-hand account of contemporaneous negotiations with the Soviets over the missing Polish officers it became an important document until Russian guilt for the massacres was acknowledged. In the post-war period Czapski was also among the eyewitnesses of the situation of Polish prisoners in Soviet captivity and testified on the matter before the United States Congress. His Lost Time: Lectures on Proust in a Soviet Prison Camp was translated into English in 2018. The Jozef Czapski Pavilion In 2016, The National Museum of Krakow inaugurated the Jozef Czapski Pavilion on the grounds of the Emeryk Hutten-Czapski Museum. The pavilion is dedicated to the grandson of the most important numismatic collector in Poland, and the permanent exhibition is about his life and work. The exhibition displays some of his diaries and paintings, as well as various multimedia presentations on his work and life. One of the exhibitions is an exact recreation of the room he lived in at the Kultura house in Maisons-Laffitte in France. The pavilion was designed by Krystyna Zachwatowicz and her husband, the film director, Andrzej Wajda.

Social perception refers to identifying and utilizing social cues to make judgments about social roles, rules, relationships, context, or the characteristics (e.g., trustworthiness) of others. This domain also includes social knowledge, which refers to one’s knowledge of social roles, norms, and schemas surrounding social situations and interactions. People learn about others' feelings and emotions by picking up information they gather from physical appearance, verbal, and nonverbal communication. Facial expressions, tone of voice, hand gestures, and body position or movement are a few examples of ways people communicate without words. A real-world example of social perception is understanding that others disagree with what one said when one sees them roll their eyes. There are four main components of social perception: observation, attribution, integration, and confirmation. Observations serve as the raw data of social perception—an interplay of three sources: persons, situations, and behavior. These sources are used as evidence in supporting a person's impression or inference about others. Another important factor to understand when talking about social perception is attribution. Attribution is expressing an individual's personality as the source or cause of their behavior during an event or situation. To fully understand the impact of personal or situational attributions, social perceivers must integrate all available information into a unified impression. To finally confirm these impressions, people try to understand, find, and create information in the form of various biases. Most importantly, social perception is shaped by an individual's current motivations, emotions, and cognitive load capacity. Cognitive load is the complete amount of mental effort utilized in the working memory. All of this combined determines how people attribute certain traits and how those traits are interpreted. The fascination and research for social perception date back to the late 1800s when social psychology was first being discovered. As more and more research on social perception is done, the realization of its significance in understanding and predicting our social world continues to grow. This overview article aims to inform readers about the processes of social perception along with brief descriptions to relevant and related theories.  Observation  The processes of social perception begin with observing persons, situations, and behaviors to gather evidence that supports an initial impression. = Persons – physical influence = Although society tries to train people not to judge others based on their physical traits, as social perceivers, we cannot help but be influenced by others' hair, skin color, height, weight, style of clothes, pitch in voice, etc., when making a first impression. People have the tendency to judge others by associating certain facial features with specific personality types. For example, studies indicate that people are perceived as stronger, more assertive, and competent if they have small eyes, low eyebrows, an angular chin, wrinkled skin, and a small forehead. People tend to associate baby-faced people with impotence and harmlessness. = Situations – context from prior experiences = People are able to easily predict the sequences or results of an event based on the extent and depth of their past experiences with a similar event. The ability to anticipate the outcomes of a situation is also greatly influenced by an individual's cultural background because this inevitably shapes the types of experiences. Situational observations either lead humans to have preset notions about certain events or to explain the causes of human behaviors. = Behaviors – nonverbal communication = Nonverbal communication helps people express their emotions, attitudes, and personalities. The most dominant form of nonverbal communication is the use of facial expressions to channel different emotions. Greatly influenced by Charles Darwin's research on facial expressions and book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), it is believed that all humans, regardless of culture or race, encode and decode the six \\"primary\\" emotions, (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust), universally in the same way. To encode means to communicate nonverbal behavior, while to decode means to interpret the meaning or intention of the nonverbal behavior. Decoding sometimes is inaccurate due to affect blend, (a facial expression with two differently registered emotions), and/or display rules, (culturally dictated rules about which nonverbal behaviors are acceptable to display). Other nonverbal cues such as: body language, eye contact, and vocal intonations can affect social perception by allowing for thin-slicing. Thin-slicing describes the ability to make quick judgements from finding consistencies in events based only on narrow frames of experience. Attribution With the observations drawn from persons, situations, and behavior, the next step is to make inferences that identify an individual's inner dispositions. =Attribution theories= A large component of social perception is attribution. Attribution is the use of information gathered through observation to help individuals understand and rationalize the causes of one's own and others' behaviors. Psychological research on attribution began with the work of Fritz Heider in 1958, and was subsequently developed by others such as Harold Kelley and Bernard Weiner. People make attributions to understand the world around them in order to seek reasons for an individual's particular behavior. When people make attributions they are able to make judgments as to what was the cause or causes of a certain behavior. Attribution theory is the study of what systems and models people implement to make attributions about the behavior of others. It attempts to explain how we use information about the social environment to understand others' behavior. One common bias people exhibit in attribution is called the fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency for people to attribute others' actions or behaviors to internal traits as opposed to external circumstances. An example of how this may manifest in the real world as pointed out in research by Furnham and Gunter is how one's view of the justness of poverty may be affected by one's financial status: one who has not experienced poverty may see it as being more or less deserved than might someone who has been impoverished at some point. In this way, fundamental attribution error can be a barrier to empathizing with others, as one does not consider all the circumstances involved in the actions of others.  Two- step process of Attributions  Unlike conventional attribution theories, the two-step process of attribution suggests that people analyze others' behaviors first by automatically making an internal attribution and only then considering possible external attributions that may affect the initial inference. Heider's most valuable contribution to the topic of attribution is the dichotomy: When attempting to decide why individuals behave a certain way, we can make either an internal or external attribution. Internal attribution, (also called dispositional attribution or personal attribution), is the assumption that an individual is acting a certain way due to something about that individual, such as personality, character, or attitude. External attribution, also called situational attribution, is the inference that an individual is acting a certain way due to the situation he or she is in; the assumption is that most individuals would respond in the same way in that similar situation. Essentially, people first assume that a person's behavior is due to his or her personality, and then attempt to modify this attribution by also factoring in the person's situation.  Jones's correspondent inference theory  According to Edward Jones and Keith Davis's correspondent inference theory, people learn about other individuals from behavior that is chosen freely, that is not anticipated, and that results in a small number of favorable outcomes. There are three factors that people use as a basis for their inferences: # An individual's degree of choice # The expectedness of the behavior # The intentions or motives behind the effects or consequences of the behavior  Kelley's covariation theory  According to American social psychologist Harold Kelley, individuals make attributions by utilizing the covariation principle. The covariation principle claims that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a certain behavior occurs and the factors that are absent when it does not occur. There are three types of covariation information that are particularly helpful: consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency. If a single individual and a large majority of individuals behave similarly in reaction to a specific stimulus, then the individual's behavior is attributed to the stimulus and is high in consensus. The individual's behavior due to this specific stimulus should be compared to the individual's behavior in reaction other stimuli within the same broader category. This helps judge whether the level of distinctiveness information is high, and thus attributed to the stimulus. Lastly, consistency information is used to see what happens to the behavior at another time when the individual and the stimulus both remain unchanged.  Integration  Unless a snap judgement is made from observing persons, situations, or behavior, people integrate the dispositions to form impressions. =Information integration theory= Norman H. Anderson, an American social psychologist, developed the information integration theory in 1981. The theory states that impressions are made from the perceiver's personal dispositions and a weighted average of the target individual's characteristics. The differences among perceivers are due to people using themselves as a standard, or frame of reference, when judging or evaluating others. People also tend to view their own skills and traits as favorable for others to also have. These impressions formed about others can also be influenced by the current, temporary mood of the perceiver. A concept called, priming also affects a perceiver's impressions of others. Priming is the tendency for recently perceived or implemented concepts or words to come to mind easily and influence the understanding of the new information. Trait information also impacts people's impressions of others, and psychologist Solomon Asch was the first to discover that the existence of one trait tends to indicate the existence of other traits. Asch claimed that central traits exist that exert a strong effect on the perceiver's overall impressions. Lastly, the sequence in which a trait is realized can also influence the trait's impact. Research shows that there is a tendency for information presented at the beginning of a sequence to have a greater effect on impressions than information presented later on, a concept called primacy effect. = Implicit personality theory = Implicit personality theory is a type of model people use to group various kinds of personality qualities together. Put in another way, implicit personality theories describe the way an observer uses the traits displayed by another person to form impressions about that other person. People pay attention to a variety of cues, including: visual, auditory, and verbal cues to predict and understand the personalities of others, in order to fill in the gap of the unknown information about a person, which assists with social interactions. Certain traits are seen as especially influential in the formation of an overall impression of an individual; these are called central traits. Other traits are less influential in impression formation, and are called peripheral traits. Which traits are central or peripheral is not fixed, but can vary based on context. For instance, saying that a person is warm versus cold may have a central impact on an individual's impression formation when paired with traits such as \\"industrious\\" and \\"determined\\", but have a more peripheral impact when paired with traits such as \\"shallow\\" or \\"vain\\". Kim and Rosenberg demonstrate that when forming impressions of others, individuals assess others on an evaluative dimension. Which is to say that, when asked to describe personality traits of others, individuals rate others on a \\"good-bad\\" dimension. People's implicit personality theories also include a number of other dimensions, such as a \\"strong-weak\\" dimension, an \\"active-passive\\" dimension, an \\"attractive- unattractive\\" dimension, etc. However, the evaluative \\"good-bad\\" dimension was the only one that universally appeared in people's descriptions of others, while the other dimensions appeared in many, but not all, people's assessments. Thus, the dimensions included in implicit personality theories on which others are rated vary from person to person, but the \\"good-bad\\" dimension appears to be part of all people's implicit personality theories.  Confirmation  After making and integrating attributions, individuals form impressions that are subject to confirmation biases and the threat of a self- fulfilling prophecy. = Competence as social perceivers = It is true that people fall for the biases identified by social psychologists and for some biases that may have not yet been identified. Despite these misjudgments, there are four reasons that soundly demonstrate people's competence as social perceivers: # People can more accurately perceive social behaviors and interactions when they have a greater history of experiences with the other people. # People can make more circumscribed predictions of how other individuals will act when in their presence. # Social perception skills can be improved through learning the rules of probability and logic. # People can make more precise inferences about others when motivated by concerns for open- mindedness and accuracy. = Factors that influence social perception =  Accuracy  The accuracy of social perception relates to the connection between judgments people make of others' psychological attributes, and the reality of those attributes with regards to the people being judged. There are three slightly varying approaches to interpreting accuracy the: pragmatic, constructivist, and realistic approaches. Empirical research suggests that social perception is mostly accurate, but the degree of accuracy is based on four major moderator variables. These moderators are attributes of the: judge, target, trait that is judged, and information on which the judgment is based. The Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM) explains that these moderators are a result of the process for accurate judgment. The process of accurate personality judgment starts with the target revealing relevant information, which then must be available to a judge, who then identifies and uses it to form a final judgment. = Difficulties in accuracy research = While accurate social perception is important, it has also been rather neglected. It is difficult to provide a set list of criteria that can be checked-off as accuracy can be subjective in nature. In the past, there was an assumption that people’s judgements were also considered erroneous and often mistaken. As such, many researchers have chosen to pursue other facets of research instead. It was not until these assumptions were proved incorrect through research and research methods became more sophisticated that genuine effort was put into analyzing accurate social perceptions. = Testing = TASIT (The Awareness of Social Inference Test) is an audiovisual test that In the past for the clinical assessment of social perception. The test is based upon several critical components of social perception that are crucial for social competence using complex, dynamic, visual, and auditory cues to assess these critical components. The test assesses the ability to identify emotions, a skill that is impaired in many clinical conditions. It also assesses the ability to judge what a speaker may be thinking or what their intentions are for the other person in the conversation, also referred to as theory of mind. Lastly, the test was developed to assess the ability to differentiate between literal and non-literal conversational remarks. The test is divided into three parts to measure; emotion, social inference – minimal, and social inference enriched. The test is composed of scenes, or vignettes, and those being assessed are asked to identify the emotions, a, feelings, beliefs, intentions, and meanings of the interactions. They are also assessed on more complex interactions to assess ability to interpret sarcasm. The results of this testing assess the level of social perception of an individual. TASIT has adequate psychometric properties as a clinical test of social perception. It is not overly prone to practice effects and is reliable for repeat administrations. Performance on TASIT is affected by information processing speed, working memory, new learning and executive functioning, but the uniquely social material that comprises the stimuli for TASIT provides useful insights into the particular difficulties people with clinical conditions experience when interpreting complex social phenomena.  Inaccuracy/distortions/fallacies  =Bias= People are prone to numerous types of confirmation biases—tendencies to construe, find, and formulate information in ways that prove existing opinions. Preconceived prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination otherwise known as social biases can contribute towards these tendencies. People are also subject to exhibiting belief perseverance, the tendency to hold false convictions even after they have been disproved.  Self  * Availability heuristic – Tendency to place more importance and reliance on more immediate memories when evaluating specific topics, methods, concepts, or decisions. It is a mental shortcut that operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, then it must at least be as important as alternatives that are less easily recalled. * Dunning–Kruger effect – An effect by which test takers fail to understand their poor performance because they suffer a double fault: A.) Shortfall of knowledge prevents them from producing correct responses & B.) Shortfall of knowledge prevents them from recognizing their lesser responses when compared to those of others. *Overconfidence bias – When one's confidence in their ability is greater than their actual ability. *Egocentric bias – The tendency to rely too heavily on one's own judgements and abilities, stemming partially from the need to satisfy one's ego. *Defensive attribution hypothesis – Tendency of people to attribute more blame to the perpetrator of an accident as the consequences become more severe. However, if people perceive that they are more similar to the perpetrator characteristically or circumstantially, they rate the perpetrator as less culpable for the accident as the severity of consequences increase. If people perceive themselves as less similar, they rate the perpetrator as more culpable. *Forer effect (Barnum effect) – Placing high belief in a general, vague description thinking it was meant specifically for an individual. For instance, people interpret horoscopes as applying to their specific situation, when in actuality the horoscope was written to apply to a wide range of people's experiences. *Counterfactual thinking – Tendency to think up alternative events or outcomes that might have happened, but did not. *Belief perseverance – Tendency to continue to maintain one's beliefs despite firm contradictory information. *Self-fulfilling prophecy – Method by which an individual's expectations about other individuals or themselves eventually cause actions in ways that confirm those expectations. *Correspondence bias – Tendency to draw inferences about a person's characteristics from behaviors that could be explained by the situation alone.  Group  *Status quo bias – Tendency to favor current or certain circumstances because they are familiar. Any changes to these circumstances are perceived as a loss. *Ingroup bias – Tendency to favor one's own group members and their actions over those of outsiders. *Stereotyping – Attributing traits to people based on certain traits of the group they are perceived to belong to. *Ensemble Coding-- also known as ensemble perception or summary representation, is the ability to see the average or variance of a group of objects. There is extensive amounts of information available to the visual system.  Interaction  *Halo effect – Tendency for the observed overall impression of an individual to affect the observers feelings and thoughts about other attributes or traits of the individual. *False-consensus effect – Tendency for people to overestimate the magnitude to which people share their behaviors, opinions, and attributes. *Base-rate fallacy – Tendency to prefer specific information over Base rate or generic information. *Psychological projection – A defense mechanism people unconsciously use to grapple with challenging feelings or emotions by attributing them to others. This incorporates Blame shifting. *Actor-Observer bias – Tendency of those acting in a situation to blame their actions on the situation, while those observing have the tendency to place the blame on the actors.

The club was founded in 1978, and home games have been played at Tanner Park since the 1993 season. The club has a Junior Munster Division 1 team, South Munster Junior 2 team and also a Junior 3 team, as well as Under 20, Under 18, Under 16, and Under 14 teams. Ballincollig RFC also supports a thriving mini rugby set-up. The club has a second senior team, with the founding of the ladies' team back in 1995, who won the AIL Division 2 title in 2006 . History Towards the end of the 1977/78 rugby season a group of 7 or 8 rugby enthusiasts had the idea of starting a rugby club in Ballincollig. They considered that in Ballincollig, a growing town with a population of approximately 10000 people, there would be a sufficient number of rugby players to form a good team. The formation of a club would also be an amenity for large numbers of children who would be growing up there. The enthusiasts were all from Ballincollig but played for different clubs. After a few meetings the club organised a match against Highfield in March 1978. The team consisted of mainly Highfield, Cork Con., and Dolphin players. The remainder of the team consisted of beginner rugby players and soccer players. All do an unusual team, Ballincollig won by 18-10.Games followed against Cork Con., Dolphin and Sundays well. The result of these matches were sufficiently good for the organisers to call a public meeting to launch the club and to register it with the Munster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union. =Crest= The crest depicts a warthog with a backdrop of the club's colours: black and white separated with a red line. The three crowns adorning the boar represent the olden Kings of Munster from long ago. =Pitch and Dressing Rooms= At this stage the problem of a pitch and dressing rooms had to be tackled. The officers approached John A. Woods Social Club. The Social Club agreed to let them use their G.A.A. pitch and dressing rooms. A G.A.A. pitch is about 137 metres long, which is about 40 metres longer than what a rugby pitch should be, so the club had the longest rugby pitch in Cork and the lowest crossbar in Rugby history, but they managed and were grateful. During that season the club played very well, but did not win any trophies. Playing Record =Season 1978/79= In the 1978/79 season the club entered competition at Minor B level. They played well in the league but failed to reach the semi-final. In the Minor B Cup they were beaten in the third round by Old Christians. During that season they played quite a few friendly matches against Junior teams. The results of these were quite promising. Aaron O'Flynn (@AareonBahh)  Twitter =Season 1979/80= The players decided to move up two grades to Junior level because of the good results achieved in Junior friendlies the season before. A second team was formed that year also to facilitate the increasing numbers of players who were joining the club. That year the club went on its first trip to Amsterdam. The Hague Rugby Club thought the team arriving was ‘Ballin College’, a long established college rugby team. They included five international players in their team. Suffice to say that the result of the game has never been made known outside the touring party! =Season 1980/81= The club again played at Junior level that season; the 2nd team played at Minor A level. That season moves were made to form a Juvenile section in the club. The club made a second trip to Amsterdam and this time there was no mistake in the club’s identity. =Season 1981/82= At an extraordinary general meeting that year the club decided to drop its first team back down to Minor A. This automatically pushed the second team back to Minor B level, which was much more suitable for them. At that general meeting also, the club was one of the few in Ireland to pass a motion against the proposed Irish tour of South Africa. That year the first team reached the semi-final of the Minor A Cup but were beaten by Cork Con, 16-13. Also in that season, Ballincollig seriously got involved in under age rugby. Trained by Jack Quaid, the Under 18 team won the West Cork Cup. They beat Bandon 12-3 in the final. =Season 1982/83= This season was a disastrous one for Ballincollig RFC in many ways. At the beginning of the season, John A. Woods Social Club informed the club that they couldn’t use the pitch and dressing rooms anymore because they needed these facilities for their own members. The first few games of the season were played either in Highfield or at Murphy’s Farm in Bishopstown. Negotiations with Cork Co. Council allowed the club to lease the grounds at Innishmore where the present pitches are. Mr. Dan Murray agreed to rent dressing rooms and training facilities to the club at Ballincollig Community School. In November 1982, the Vice-Captain of the first team, Denis Quaid, suffered a brain haemorrhage while playing against Kanturk on the pitch at Innishmore. He was rushed to hospital but all in vain for Denis never recovered. He died a few days later. He was 30 years old and his wife Mary was expecting their first baby. The baby boy, called Denis, was born the following April. =Season 1983/84= At the start of the season Mary Quaid donated a commemorative cup in memory of Denis and asked for a competition to be held in memory of him. The club decided on a one-day festival in September. Sixteen clubs were invited, fourteen clubs were represented. After a magnificent day of rugby, Muskerry emerged victorious. They were the first holders of the Denis Quaid Trophy. In November the club held their most successful tour to date when they travelled to Plymouth with a strong team where they won one and lost one match. Also in that season the first team reached the semi-final of the minor A league, where they were beaten 6-3 by Kanturk. In the minor A Cup they reached the final but were beaten by Highfield 13-12. =Season 1984/85= The highlight of this season was Ballincollig winning the Denis Quaid Trophy. That year twelve clubs were represented. The first team again reached the semi-final of the Minor A league. They were beaten by Dunmanway, 14-9. They were beaten in the first round of the Minor A Cup. The second fifteen reached the semi-final of the B Cup but lost to Kinsale 6-3. In March 1985, the club ended its association with the West End Bar where all the weekly meetings and post match discussions had been held since the founding of the club. The West End changed hands at this time. The club was delighted to accept the offer of the Shanahan family to use Oriel House as their base. Oriel House also provided the club with dressing room facilities. =Season 1985/86= The Denis Quaid Trophy was now firmly established as a prestigious competition. The competition this season was won by Dunmanway. Ballincollig won the White Horse Plate, which was a secondary competition during the Denis Quaid Festival. That season, the club held an under 12 competition as well. This was attended by ten teams. The teams were aiming to win a cup presented Tom Power. Presentation College were the winners. =Season 1986/87= 1986/87 had a poor start when the captain, Michael Moloney, following a road accident, had to stand down as captain. Phil Rees, the vice-captain decided to retire and Colin Glavin was eventually elected captain. Mary Quaid became the first female officer of the club when she was elected Secretary. Mary Stratford became the first female member of the general committee. Douglas won the White Horse Plate. The competition for the Denis Quaid Trophy maintained its high standard and status. The 2nd XV reached the final of the McCarthy Cup, the real breakthrough. =Season 1987/88= Beginning this season the nomenclature of rugby team grades in the South Munster Branch was changed. These changes were made to bring it into line with the other branches. The Ballincollig 1st XV or Minor A changed to Junior II and the Minor B team became Junior III. The 1st XV (JuniorII) team played well in the league but did not qualify for the final stages. Neither 1st nor 2nd teams got very far. Midleton won the Denis Quaid cup.

He started umpiring in the Melbourne Boy’s Club Association and umpired in the VFL in 1941 and 1942 before serving in the army during World War II. He rejoined the VFL in 1946 and umpired six Grand Finals (including both in 1948 when Essendon and Melbourne tied the first match). His umpiring career spanned from 1941 to 1955, and in total he umpired 216 games, including 16 finals matches. He umpired Grand Finals in 1948 (x2), 1949, 1950, 1953, and 1954. McMurray umpired Grand Finals and Carnivals in most States under the system of exchanges and carnivals that were in place during his career. All games were umpired under the one field umpire system. After retiring from VFL umpiring Jack Jnr decided in 1956 to accept appointment to the Tasmanian Football League (TFL) umpire coaching role after an offer to take up either Perth or Hobart positions. Following this move McMurray umpired the TFL grand final umpire in 1956, which was his last senior game and then he retired from umpiring.

His campaign gained an Internet following and national attention due to outspoken debate appearances during 2007, but consistently showed little support in national polls. In the 2008 Democratic caucuses and primaries, he did not win any delegates. Out of the eight candidates for the Democratic nomination for president, he received the fewest votes - less than one percent. In March 2008, Gravel announced that he had joined the Libertarian Party and would seek its presidential nomination, instead of further pursuing the Democratic nomination. In May 2008, Gravel finished fourth at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention and ended both his presidential quest and his political career, until his 2020 presidential campaign. Announcement Mike Gravel at the launch of his presidential campaign on April 17, 2006 On April 17, 2006, Gravel became the first candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 election, announcing his run in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Short on campaign cash, he took public transportation to get to his announcement.Philip Elliot, [public.findlaw.com/pnews/news/ap/p/621/04-18-2006/c60b0015abcf40d9.html \\"Ex- Alaska Sen. Gravel Runs for President\\"], Associated Press, April 17, 2006. Accessed March 10, 2007. Gravel had spoken out against the war in Iraq since before the invasion of that country began in March 2003. In his announcement he called for immediate cessation of US military involvement in Iraq via his own-drafted U.S. Armed Forces Withdrawal From Iraq Act, and offered a strategy he claimed would get it passed. He unequivocally denounced any possible war with Iran. His announced campaign platform was centered on systemic changes to the U.S. system. Foremost among these were: * The National Initiative for Democracy, a Constitutional amendment and proposed federal statute that would recognize a fourth branch of the US federal government in addition to the judicial, executive and legislative branches, namely the people via direct democracy, enabled to directly initiate and pass legislation and to amend the Constitution of the United States on their own. * A national sales tax that would replace the income tax and the Internal Revenue Service. Gravel's initial campaign also emphasized his support for a single-payer national health care system, term limits, nuclear disarmament, and same-sex marriage recognition. Campaign developments 2006 Although Gravel's candidacy was little-noticed by the national media, at its outset he campaigned almost full- time in New Hampshire (the first primary state). He garnered broader awareness and interest through his occasional television appearances, netroots campaigning, participation in Party forums (such as the Democratic Presidential Candidates Forum and Democratic National Committee (DNC) Winter Conference), and up until October 30 in Philadelphia, the string of televised debates sponsored by the DNC and others. Gravel was interviewed for the Blue State Observer weblog on June 27, 2006. On that occasion he expressed his support for constitutional change in aid of citizen-initiated legislation, he declaimed the existence of limitations upon the conduct of stem cell research, and stated he was against the widespread deportation of illegal immigrants then being advocated by conservative talk radio and other elements. An August 2006 media release draws attention to the candidate's public opposition to the prospect of war in Iraq expressed as long ago as the early months of 2002. The campaign and/or candidate attracted mainstream coverage in The New York Times, The Reno Gazette-Journal, on CBS News, on ABC News, in The Progressive, and in The American Spectator/ Gravel delivered an address before the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in November 2006 which has been recorded and published on video. The campaign website included participation forums. A video section of the campaign website linked to videos of some media appearances, his address to the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, a September 2006 appearance at the 'Camp Democracy' activist forum in Washington D.C., as well as the introductory video from his successful 1968 Senate campaign. The candidate has maintained his own weblog since October 2006, and began blogging at The Huffington Post in June 2007 as well. The Gravel campaign also had its own YouTube channel featuring more than 80 videos of the candidate's past speeches and campaign appearances. Campaign developments 2007 =First quarter= Gravel's address before the DNC National Winter Conference in early February 2007 was received – enthusiastically, claimed campaign advocates – and was broadcast on C-SPAN. In speaking he offered harsh judgments against President Bush and the Senate Democratic leadership, and implicitly his presidential rivals Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and John Edwards, saying \\"anyone who voted for the war on October 11 based upon what President Bush presented to them is not qualified to hold the office of President of the United States.\\" Gravel was interviewed on MSNBC at the time. He also appeared as a guest of a video weblog directed from New Jersey answering questions about netroots and the blogosphere. Senator Gravel was interviewed on Toniq TV where he forthrightly expressed views supporting the lifting of restrictions against the service of identified gays and lesbians in the US military. Calling comparison to President Harry S. Truman's racial desegregation of the US military in 1948, he criticized former President Bill Clinton as 'dead wrong' and 'mousy' for his innovation of the 'don't ask don't tell' policy covering homosexual conduct by military members: > When Clinton got to be President, well, the first he's doing is standing > there on two legs waffling back and forth, oh, don't tell us you're gay. > What are you talking about? If you had any knowledge of history, ancient > history, in Sparta they encouraged homosexuality because they fight for the > people they love. And if it's your partner and you love them, you're > prepared to die for them, and that's the same ethic you see in the military > today. It's not the country. It's my partner. Go see the movies on war, and > it's always the person next to me who is in my foxhole with me. Well, I got > to tell you, extend that a little further and you'll see why the Spartans > trained their people to be homosexuals, because they're better fighters. On February 11, 2007, the senator addressed the Jefferson County Presidents Day Dinner in Watertown, Wisconsin. On February 13, 2007, the senator released a statement outlining his views on the possibility of impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush, regarding it as 'not sufficient' and favoring a congressional inquiry which could ultimately lead to criminal charges being brought against the President. Senator Gravel participated in the AFSCME Democratic Presidential Forum on 21 February 2007 in Carson City, Nevada, at the Carson City Community Center. He appears toward the end of the video of the broadcast of the event. In the Carson City Forum, he roundly condemned President Bush's policy of military involvement in Iraq and reminded those present of his statements warning of lies and distortions about Iraq's supposed unlawful weapons of mass destruction as far back as early 2002 (the time of the occurrence of the first signs of the Bush Administration's formulation of an agenda for military action against Iraq). He decried the overall level of military spending as opposed to the funding of education and of what he regarded as the consequent, poor educational outcomes achieved. Senator Gravel called on congressional Democrats to force a 'constitutional crisis' by denying all further budgetary appropriations in aid of continued American military involvement in Iraq. He further argued that the income tax should be 'wiped out' in favor of the FairTax proposal - which imposes a progressive sales tax on newly manufactured items varying from 19% to 23% while providing 'prebates' to 'untax' families spending on necessities, up to the poverty level. He stated his view that experience showed income taxes were successfully 'gamed' by the wealthy at the expense of the poor and middle income earners. And he voiced his support for the constitutional and legal reform necessary to effect the National Initiative as a means of enabling citizen-initiated national lawmaking. Senator Gravel also spoke in favor of public financial assistance for campaigning presidential candidates. On February 26, 2007, Senator Gravel was interviewed about his campaign on the American C-SPAN network's Washington Journal program. In a February 25, 2007 Washington Post/ABC News nationwide poll of voters who lean Democratic, 0% supported Gravel for the Democratic presidential nomination. Indeed, through February 2007, such opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination all showed Gravel with a 1% or less support level. At the close of the first quarter 2007 reporting period, the campaign committee had $498 in cash against debts and obligations amounting to $88,515. FEC Quarterly filing for April quarter 2007 =Second quarter= Because of his time in the Senate, Gravel was invited to many of the early Democratic presidential debates. The first Democratic debate of the pre-primary season was in the evening of April 26, 2007, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, at South Carolina State University. State party chairman Joe Erwin said that he chose South Carolina State because it is an historically black college, noting that African-Americans have been the \\"most loyal\\" Democrats in the state. The debate was 90 minutes with a 60-second time limit for answers, and no opening or closing statements. It was broadcast via cable television and online video streaming by MSNBC. The debate was moderated by Brian Williams of NBC Nightly News. Gravel appeared with the seven other contenders for the Democratic nomination for president. He stated that the Iraq War had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the \\"war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.\\" He maintained that an end to the war could be effected by a bill passed in the House and a Senate filibuster on such a bill defeated by a daily vote on cloture, but that the will to do so was lacking. Further, he suggested a bill requiring the president to withdraw from Iraq on pain of criminal penalties. He said the recent threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike in the \\"war on terror\\" was immoral and would be dropped under a Gravel administration, and that America has no important military enemies and it is the influence of the military-industrial complex that has conditioned Americans to think of the world in terms of enemies. He characterized the CIA overthrow of democracy in Iran in the 1950s lies as the root of U.S. problems with that country. Overall, he said that all American armed forces who died in Vietnam died in vain and American armed forces in Iraq were dying in vain. Regarding his fellow candidates, he said, \\"I got to tell you, after standing up with them, some of these people frighten me — they frighten me.\\"No Breakout Candidate at Democratic Debate, ABC News, April 26, 2007 Media stories about the debate said that Gravel was responsible for much of whatever \\"heat\\" and \\"flashpoints\\" had taken place.\\"Clinton edges ahead after first Democratic debate\\", The Times, April 27, 2007.Hillary Clinton shines in Democratic candidates' debate, Ewen MacAskill, The Guardian, April 27, 2007. Gravel gained considerable publicity by shaking up the normally staid multiple-candidate format; The New York Times' media critic said that what Gravel had done was \\"steal a debate with outrageous, curmudgeonly statements.\\" The Internet was a benefit: a YouTube video of his responses in the debate was viewed more than 225,892 times, ranking seventeenth in most views for week and first among news and politics clips; It was also ranked #7 top rated (for week), #23 top favored (for week), #25 most discussed (for week), #4 most linked (for week), and #1 top rated - news and politics (for week). his name became the fifteenth most searched-for in the blogosphere; and his website garnered more traffic than those of frontrunners Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or John Edwards. Gravel appeared on the popular Colbert Report on television on May 2, and his campaign and career were profiled in national publications such as Salon.Alex Koppelman, \\"Don't worry, be Mike Gravel\\", Salon.com, May 7, 2007. Accessed July 4, 2007. All of this did not help his poll ratings: a May 2007 CNN poll showed him with less than 0.5 percent support among Democrats. In late May 2007, two wordless, avant-garde campaign videos, \\"Rock\\" and \\"Fire\\", created by Otis College of Art and Design staff Matt Mayes and Guston Sondin-Klausner, were released on YouTube and became hits. The first, nearly three minutes long, showed Gravel staring at the camera silently for more than one minute, then throwing a large rock into a lake and slowly walking away, with a sole graphic showing the campaign website. The second, nearly eight minutes long, briefly showed Gravel walking through a forest collecting wood and looking at the resultant campfire, then for the remaining seven minutes just showed the fire burning, with the website graphic superimposed. These videos would eventually gain over 480,000 and 140,000 views respectively. \\"Rock\\" was given airtime during an episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. WMUR-TV, CNN, and the New Hampshire Union Leader hosted both Democratic and Republican debates in Goffstown, New Hampshire, at Saint Anselm College. The Democratic debate was Sunday, June 3, starting at 7 PM EDT and lasting two hours, commercial free. The moderator was Wolf Blitzer, host of Late Edition and The Situation Room.Union Leader - Primary calendar, New Hampshire Union Leader, Apr. 12, 2007 He was joined by Tom Fahey of the Union Leader and Scott Spradling from the local NH television station WMUR. The first half of the debate was a directed question and answer, with candidates at podiums, as in the first debate, responding to questions from Fahey and Spradling. On March 17, 2007, CNN, the New Hampshire Union Leader and WMUR-TV had formally decided to exclude former Senator Gravel from debates between Democratic presidential candidates they would be sponsoring in New Hampshire.CNN and local media have banned Mike Gravel from New Hampshire debates  Mike Gravel For President 2008 The decision was decried as \\"censorship, unbecoming a free society\\", and on May 1 the decision was reversed, and Gravel was invited to be a participant. The venue was Saint Anselm College and the debate was nationally televised on CNN. Gravel reiterated many of his past foreign policy points during the debate, and emphasized that Biden, Clinton, Dodd, and Edwards voted for the resolution under which the invasion and occupation of Iraq were undertaken and Edwards co-sponsored it. Gravel claimed that the history of Southeast Asia after U.S. withdrawal showed Iraq withdrawal would not necessarily be dire, and that the insurgency in Iraq was successful because it had the support of the Iraqi people. He said that the fact that the other candidates knew, or should have known, that there were \\"two sets of books\\" being kept on intelligence from Iraq, and that they voted the resolution that authorized the war in spite of that fact, indicates that morality plays no part in their political decisions and that lack of moral judgment ought to keep them from the presidency. Two of eight candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator. Barack Obama was accorded the greatest talk-time at 16 full minutes, 2.85 times the talk-time accorded Gravel, who was accorded the least talk-time at 5.62 minutes. On June 28, 2007 in Washington, D.C., PBS held and televised a debate at Howard University, an historically black college. The moderator was Tavis Smiley. All eight candidates discussed various topics including education, poverty, unemployment, racial discrimination, and health in the black community. The debate drew a record crowd of celebrities, such as Harry Belafonte, Al Sharpton, Dorothy Heights, Jesse Jackson, Terry McMillan, Judge Hatchett, and Mark Ridley-Thomas. Gravel's points in the debate included that the \\"war on drugs\\" was a failure. He asserted that the prison population of the US had increased 1285% over the past 35 years and that 70% of that population is African-American. Gravel compared the legal basis for the war on drugs to Prohibition, claimed that it made criminals of people who otherwise were not criminals, and that they were disproportionately African-American. Gravel asserted that the money spent on the war in Iraq could have built 4 million houses thus helping victims of hurricane Katrina, or financed 21 million four- year college scholarships, or hired 7.6 million new teachers. Gravel said that the income tax code was especially open to corruption. That the tax code was now so complicated and corrupted that no one alive understood it. He said that with his alternative, progressive sales tax proposal everyone would know what everyone else was paying in taxes. Gravel said that equal justice before the law would only be possible if the people were empowered as lawmakers. Gravel asserted that Free Trade Agreements benefited corporate management and shareholders but hurt most people on both sides to the agreement.CFR Transcript [rtsp://video.c-span.org/archive/c08/c08_062807_demsdebate.rm C-SPAN Video] This was the first debate during which all the candidates were accorded equal time. The earlier debates were heavily biased toward the 'Top- tier' candidates.

Has it been fair thus far?\\" Detractors began to liken Gravel to \\"the cranky uncle who lives in the attic,\\" or \\"the angry old guy that just seemed to want to become angrier.\\" Gravel at the Yearly Kos convention at McCormick Place in Chicago on August 4, 2007 On August 4, 2007, the Yearly Kos Presidential Leadership Forum was held in Chicago, Illinois. This informal discussion was attended by seven of the eight presidential candidates, with Joe Biden not attending due to votes in Congress. New York Times Magazine writer Matt Bai and DailyKos Contributing Editor and Fellow Joan McCarter moderated. The debate was broken down into Domestic Policy, Foreign Policy, and Philosophy and Leadership. Candidates were allotted 90 seconds for each question with 45 second rebuttals, although the time limits were not strictly enforced. After the debate, breakout sessions were held where convention goers could question each candidate individually. Gravel expounded upon the shortcomings of representational government, concluding with, \\"So the only answer is for you to realize that the answer is not up here on the dais, the answer is with you, the American people, to acquire lawmaking powers.\\" He reiterated that the U.S. Senate had the power to shut down the Iraq War with a series of forced cloture votes if they so chose. And he talked about the effect of the concentration of the media and of money in politics, saying \\"You gotta keep in mind that all politicians sort of walk in the mud. You know their head may be up here but they walk in the mud. And you have to understand that, because of the way the system is structured, you have to raise money. We're raising hundreds of millions of dollars on this dais for these people to talk to you, when we all know that money is the corrupting agent of politics, and lo and behold the media, which is now controlled in this country by five corporations, is telling us that these people who raise the most, who technically are the most corrupt, are the ones that should get to be elected.\\" On August 9, 2007, Gravel participated in an LGBT network Logo hosted debate focusing on LGBT issues, moderated by Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese and singer Melissa Etheridge in Los Angeles, California. Gravel was originally excluded from this debate, the reason given that his campaign had not raised enough money to qualify for participation.

Asked if he believed in the efficacy of prayer Gravel replied that he believed in love, that love implements courage, and that courage fosters all the other virtues useful in life. Gravel observed that many of the people who pray are the same ones who want to go to war and thus to kill fellow human beings. Gravel said that more love between individual Americans, individual Iowans, would enable more individual courage, and that more courage would enable Americans to grapple with the problems of governance. Gravel also questioned Americans' view of their country as \\"Number 1\\" in the world. Five of eight candidates, Joe Biden, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator. Barack Obama was accorded the greatest talk-time at 13.17 minutes, 2.7 times the talk-time accorded Gravel, who was accorded the least talk-time at 4.88 minutes.[rtsp://video.c-span.org/project/rwh/rwh081907.rm C-SPAN Video] Berkley political scientist David Terr found that moderator George Stephanopoulos directed roughly five percent of his questions to Gravel; In a poll asking who did the best in the debate, Gravel placed seventh among the eight candidates.

During the course of the forum Gravel stated that it was wrong that the father of (Pfc. 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment) Armando Soriano (age 20, of Houston), killed in Iraq (1 Feb 2004, in Haditha), was about to be deported. Along with the other candidates Gravel committed to immigration reform in his first year as president. Gravel then charged that the national immigration issue was in fact a case of scapegoating immigrants for other systemic problems in the US, in education and health care for example. Gravel said he was embarrassed that the US was building a wall on its southern border. Gravel charged that CAFTA and NAFTA were the real causes of many of the problems on both sides of the US borders but confessed that he thought remedying those acts would have to await the enactment of the National Initiative for Democracy and the empowerment of US citizens as legislators. Gravel said that instead he would reach out to Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and to Castro leadership in Cuba as well. Reminded that health problems had forced Gravel into bankruptcy, Gravel was asked how he would apply his personal experience to the problem of health care. Gravel outlined his plan for healthcare vouchers, paid for out of general revenues, to be applied against premiums of up to five private plans and one government plan, each with identical defined benefits, each mandated to allow freedom of choice of provider. All candidates were accorded equal talk times at the Univision forum.http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/09/09/23/English_transcript.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf A September 11, 2007 Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll found that, among registered South Carolina voters who plan to vote in the Democratic primary or usually vote for Democrats, 2% would vote for Gravel \\"if the presidential primary were held today\\".https://www.scribd.com/doc/282208/LAT-Bloomberg- Presidential-Poll-09112007 Scribd.com LAT Bloomberg Presidential Poll 09-11-2007 Candidates Chris Dodd, Dennis Kucinich, and Bill Richardson each got 1% of respondents to that question.

Gravel and Dennis Kucinich were excluded from the debate on the grounds that they did not have at least one paid staff member or office space in Iowa. On September 26, 2007 in Hanover, New Hampshire, MSNBC held a debate at Dartmouth College in conjunction with New England Cable News and New Hampshire Public Radio. During the course of the debate Gravel reiterated many of his familiar positions on Iraq. When asked his opinion Gravel stated that anyone old enough to fight and die for the nation ought to be able to drink alcohol legally. Asked if he would tax gasoline to reduce national consumption Gravel said that he would tax all carbon based fuels to eliminate the politicians' and bureaucrats' playing favorites in the implementation of such a scheme. As well, he offered that he thought it futile to try to get the Congress to pass such a law, that it would instead require his proposed National Initiative and the empowering of the people to do so. Further he said that the nation could eliminate gasoline as an energy source in 5 years and all carbon based fuels in 10 years if it could just summon the will to do so, substituting wind generated electricity, for instance, for nuclear reactors as a source of power. None of the eight candidates were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator, who accorded himself 19.42 minutes of talk-time. Hillary Clinton was accorded the second greatest amount of talk-time at 17.62 minutes, 4.1 times the talk-time accorded Gravel, who was accorded the least amount of talk-time at 4.33 minutes. A September 27–30, 2007 American Research Group Poll showed Gravel with 2%, tied with Joe Biden and ahead of Dennis Kucinich. By the end of the third-quarter 2007, the committee had $17,526.55 in cash on hand, and had collected a total of $379,794.85 so far during the 2008 election cycle. FEC Quarterly filing for October quarter 2007 =Fourth quarter= On October 1, 2007, Gravel was interviewed on PBS. He described himself as an ordinary guy, and would be more likely to take the train than fly in a private jet. He explained that other leading nations, including Russia, spend just 3%–4% of their budget on defense, while the US defense budget is more than all other nations combined. He then rhetorically asked: \\"What are we afraid of?\\" He explained that the defense budget is associated with the military industrial complex. He stated that the US military is internationally competitive, but the US schools and health care system are not. Gravel said that Ralph Nader once referred to him as a \\"breath of fresh air\\". On October 19, it was announced that Gravel was excluded from the next Democratic debate – October 30, 2007 in Philadelphia to be televised on NBC News and MSNBC and held at Drexel University – with the debate sponsors or the Democratic National Committee saying Gravel's campaign had not met fund-raising, polling, or local campaign organizational thresholds. For the Philadelphia exclusion, Gravel blamed corporate censorship on the part of sponsor owner and alleged military-industrial complex member General Electric for his exclusion. Senator Gravel mounted a counter-gathering and debate against a video screen a short distance away, at Philadelphia's \\"World Cafe Live\\" at the same time as, and two blocks from, the Democratic presidential debate from which he was excluded. The debate was shown on a large screen, with Senator Gravel providing a running commentary and later answering audience questions. The event was called \\"An Alternate October 30th\\" and initially announced on Gravel's YouTube page. However, Gravel's exclusion continued for almost all of the subsequent Democratic debates, and he had thus lost his easiest publicity. At some point, none of the major polls were including Gravel's name in their polling.RealClearPolitics - Polls Despite poor polling numbers, Gravel had positive support among young people and Internet users, however his lowest support came from the constituency. Blind polls suggested that he would garner much more voting support if his positions were more well known. For the fourth quarter of 2007, Gravel reported no money raised. Following Gravel's exclusion from most of the Democratic debates, and consequent impairment to his monetary turnover, his supporters began organizing \\"mass donation days\\" to help the campaign gain momentum and necessary funds, in the manner of Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Such planned days included: * October 30, 2007, in response to the exclusion of Gravel from the debate Philadelphia held a day later; * December 5, 2007, the anniversary of the Repeal of Prohibition (this day yielded upwards of $10,000 from donations); * January 1, 2008, using the phrase \\"Gravel Resolution for Revolution\\" as a catchphrase and way to publicize; and * January 27, 2008, the anniversary of the end of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War, in light of Gravel's efforts as a senator. Caucuses and primaries 2008 Gravel did not compete in the initial January 3, 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, choosing to focus on the New Hampshire primary instead, and received no Iowa state delegates. Nevertheless, he was still subjected to a false report from Keith Olbermann of MSNBC that he had pulled out of the race afterward, as had fellow Democratic candidates Chris Dodd and Joe Biden. Later that night, Gravel's campaign issued a press release and YouTube video denying this and making it clear that Gravel intends to continue his campaign and that he does not intend to drop out of the race for presidency. Keith Olbermann later apologized to the Gravel campaign stating that a man named Alex Colvin, Gravel's press secretary, contacted MSNBC news at approximately 11:30 PM. MSNBC double-checked the source and believed the man was who he said he was, and was subsequently read on the air. Gravel in Goffstown, New Hampshire, two days before the primary there Gravel did focus much of his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary held on January 8, and gained some media attention for a pre-election appearance at Phillips Exeter Academy where he told students that using marijuana was safer than drinking alcohol. In the primary he received 402 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14 percent. Gravel said he would take some time off from campaigning to deal with a respiratory infection. He subsequently resumed campaigning. On January 15, 2008, Gravel received 2,363 votes out of 593,837 votes cast in the Michigan primary, or 0.40 percent. Campaigning was light in the Democratic primary due to an intra-party dispute removing several top candidates' names from the ballot. Gravel did not reach viability in any of the Nevada caucuses in the state on January 19, 2008, and as a result, received no delegates. On January 26, 2008, Gravel received 214 votes out of 532,468 votes cast in the South Carolina primary, or 0.04 percent. On January 29, 2008, Gravel finished 8th in the Florida primary, with a little over 5,000 votes. He finished behind 4 candidates who had already withdrawn.http://www.nbc-2.com/Elections/ This primary too was affected by an intra-party dispute causing several candidates not to campaign. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running. Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. As March neared a close, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries. Switch to Libertarian Party 2008 Gravel during a debate at the Libertarian National Convention On March 26, 2008, Gravel announced that he had abandoned his bid for the Democratic Party nomination and would seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party, stating \\"I look forward to advancing my presidential candidacy within the Libertarian Party, which is considerably closer to my values, my foreign policy views and my domestic views.\\" As a Libertarian candidate, Gravel found more support than he had as a Democrat, placing second and third in two April 2008 straw polls. In the May 25 balloting at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention in Denver, Gravel finished fourth out of eight candidates on the initial ballot, with 71 votes out of 618; he trailed former Congressman and eventual winner Bob Barr, author Mary Ruwart, and businessman Wayne Allyn Root. Gravel's position did not improve subsequently and he was eliminated on the fourth ballot. Afterwards he said, \\"I just ended my political career. From 15 years old to now, my political career is over, and it's no big deal. I'm a writer, I'm a lecturer, I'm going to push the issues of freedom and liberty. I'm going to push those issues until the day I die.\\" Political positions Endorsements Gravel had the endorsement of campaign finance reform activist Doris Haddock and received financial contributions from actor Mark Ruffalo.

Like bubble chambers, cloud chambers, and wire chambers nuclear emulsion plates record the tracks of charged particles passing through. They are compact, have high density and produce a cumulative record, but have the disadvantage that the plates must be developed before the tracks can be observed. Nuclear emulsions can be used to record and investigate fast charged particles like nucleons or mesons. After exposing and developing the plate, single particle tracks can be observed and measured using a microscope. In 1937, Marietta Blau and Hertha Wambacher discovered nuclear disintegration stars due to spallation in nuclear emulsions that had been exposed to cosmic radiation at a height of 2,300 metres (≈7,500 feet) above sea level.

They can be used to relate molecular orbital calculations to simple bonding theories, and also to speed up post- Hartree–Fock electronic structure calculations by taking advantage of the local nature of electron correlation. Localized orbitals in systems with periodic boundary conditions are known as Wannier functions. Standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods lead to delocalized orbitals that, in general, extend over an entire molecule and have the symmetry of the molecule. Localized orbitals may then be found as linear combinations of the delocalized orbitals, given by an appropriate unitary transformation. In the water molecule for example, ab initio calculations show bonding character primarily in two molecular orbitals, each with electron density equally distributed among the two O-H bonds. The localized orbital corresponding to one O-H bond is the sum of these two delocalized orbitals, and the localized orbital for the other O-H bond is their difference; as per Valence bond theory. For multiple bonds and lone pairs, different localization procedures give different orbitals. The Boys and Edmiston-Ruedenberg localization methods mix these orbitals to give equivalent bent bonds in ethylene and rabbit ear lone pairs in water, while the Pipek-Mezey method preserves their respective σ and π symmetry. Equivalence of localized and delocalized orbital descriptions For molecules with a closed electron shell, in which each molecular orbital is doubly occupied, the localized and delocalized orbital descriptions are in fact equivalent and represent the same physical state. It might seem, again using the example of water, that placing two electrons in the first bond and two other electrons in the second bond is not the same as having four electrons free to move over both bonds. However, in quantum mechanics all electrons are identical and cannot be distinguished as same or other. The total wavefunction must have a form which satisfies the Pauli exclusion principle such as a Slater determinant (or linear combination of Slater determinants), and it can be shown Levine I.N., “Quantum Chemistry” (4th ed., Prentice-Hall 1991) sec.15.8 that if two electrons are exchanged, such a function is unchanged by any unitary transformation of the doubly occupied orbitals. For molecules with an open electron shell, in which some molecular orbitals are singly occupied, the electrons of alpha and beta spin must be localized separately. This applies to radical species such as nitric oxide and dioxygen. Again, in this case the localized and delocalized orbital descriptions are equivalent and represent the same physical state. Computation methods Localized molecular orbitals (LMO) are obtained by unitary transformation upon a set of canonical molecular orbitals (CMO). The transformation usually involves the optimization (either minimization or maximization) of the expectation value of a specific operator. The generic form of the localization potential is: \\\\langle \\\\hat{L} \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\langle \\\\phi_i \\\\phi_i  \\\\hat{L}  \\\\phi_i \\\\phi_i \\\\rangle , where \\\\hat{L} is the localization operator and \\\\phi_i is a molecular spatial orbital. Many methodologies have been developed during the past decades, differing in the form of \\\\hat{L}. The optimization of the objective function is usually performed using pairwise Jacobi rotations. However, this approach is prone to saddle point convergence (if it even converges), and thus other approaches have also been developed, from simple conjugate gradient methods with exact line searches, to Newton-Raphson and trust-region methods. =Foster-Boys= The Foster-Boys (also known as Boys) localization method minimizes the spatial extent of the orbitals by minimizing \\\\langle \\\\hat{L} \\\\rangle , where \\\\hat{L} = \\\\vec{r}_1 - \\\\vec{r}_2^2 . This turns out to be equivalent Introduction to Computational Chemistry by Frank Jensen 1999, page 228 equation 9.27 to the easier task of maximizing \\\\sum_{i}^{n}[ \\\\langle \\\\phi_i  \\\\vec{r}  \\\\phi_i \\\\rangle ] ^2 . In one dimension, the Foster-Boys (FB) objective function can also be written as \\\\langle \\\\hat{L}_\\\\text{FB} \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_i \\\\langle \\\\phi_i  (\\\\hat{x} - \\\\langle i  \\\\hat{x}  i \\\\rangle ) ^2  \\\\phi_i \\\\rangle . =Fourth moment= The fourth moment (FM) procedure is analogous to Foster-Boys scheme, however the orbital fourth moment is used instead of the orbital second moment. The objective function to be minimized is \\\\langle \\\\hat{L}_\\\\text{FM} \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_i \\\\langle \\\\phi_i  (\\\\hat{x} - \\\\langle i  \\\\hat{x}  \\\\phi_i \\\\rangle ) ^4  i \\\\rangle . The fourth moment method produces more localized virtual orbitals than Foster-Boys method, since it implies a larger penalty on the delocalized tails. For graphene (a delocalized system), the fourth moment method produces more localized occupied orbitals than Foster-Boys and Pipek-Mezey schemes. =Edmiston-Ruedenberg= Edmiston-Ruedenberg localization maximizes the electronic self-repulsion energy by maximizing \\\\langle \\\\hat{L}_\\\\text{ER} \\\\rangle , where \\\\hat{L} = \\\\vec{r}_1 - \\\\vec{r}_2^{-1} . =Pipek-Mezey= Pipek-Mezey localization takes a slightly different approach, maximizing the sum of orbital-dependent partial charges on the nuclei: \\\\langle \\\\hat{L} \\\\rangle_\\\\textrm{PM} = \\\\sum_{A}^{\\\\textrm{atoms}} \\\\sum_{i}^{\\\\textrm{orbitals}} q_i^A^2 . Pipek and Mezey originally used Mulliken charges, which are mathematically ill defined. Recently, Pipek-Mezey style schemes based on a variety of mathematically well- defined partial charge estimates have been discussed. Some notable choices are Voronoi charges, Becke charges, Hirshfeld or Stockholder charges, intrinsic atomic orbital charges, Bader charges, or \\"fuzzy atom\\" charges. Rather surprisingly, despite of the wide variation in the (total) partial charges reproduced by the different estimates, analysis of the resulting Pipek-Mezey orbitals has shown that the localized orbitals are rather insensitive to the partial charge estimation scheme used in the localization process. However, due to the ill-defined mathematical nature of Mulliken charges (and Löwdin charges, which have also been used in some works), as better alternatives are nowadays available it is advisable to use them in favor of the original version. The most important quality of the Pipek-Mezey scheme is that it preserves σ-π separation in planar systems, which sets it apart from the Foster-Boys and Edmiston-Ruedenberg schemes that mix σ and π bonds. This property holds independent of the partial charge estimate used. While the usual formulation of the Pipek-Mezey method invokes an iterative procedure to localize the orbitals, a non-iterative method has also been recently suggested.  In organic chemistry  A list of localized molecular orbitals considered in organic chemistry, showing component atomic orbitals and all shapes of the MOs they constitute. In reality, AOs and MOs, as obtained from computations, are much \\"fatter\\" than depicted in these cartoons. Organic chemistry is often discussed in terms of localized molecular orbitals in a qualitative and informal sense. Historically, much of classical organic chemistry was built on the older valence bond / orbital hybridization models of bonding. To account for phenomena like aromaticity, this simple model of bonding is supplemented by semi-quantitative results from Hückel molecular orbital theory. However, the understanding of stereoelectronic effects requires the analysis of interactions between donor and acceptor orbitals between two molecules or different regions within the same molecule, and molecular orbitals must be considered. Because proper (symmetry-adapted) molecular orbitals are fully delocalized and do not admit a ready correspondence with the \\"bonds\\" of the molecule, as visualized by the practicing chemist, the most common approach is to instead consider the interaction between filled and unfilled localized molecular orbitals that correspond to σ bonds, π bonds, lone pairs, and their unoccupied counterparts. These orbitals and typically given the notation σ (sigma bonding), π (pi bonding), n (occupied nonbonding orbital, \\"lone pair\\"), p (unoccupied nonbonding orbital, \\"empty p orbital\\"; the symbol n* for unoccupied nonbonding orbital is seldom used), π* (pi antibonding), and σ* (sigma antibonding). (Woodward and Hoffmann use ω for nonbonding orbitals in general, occupied or unoccupied.) When comparing localized molecular orbitals derived from the same atomic orbitals, these classes generally follow the order σ < π < n < p (n*) < π* < σ* when ranked by increasing energy. The localized molecular orbitals that organic chemists often depict can be thought of as qualitative renderings of orbitals generated by the computational methods described above. However, they do not map onto any single approach, nor are they used consistently. For instance, the lone pairs of water are usually treated as two equivalent spx hybrid orbitals, while the corresponding \\"nonbonding\\" orbitals of carbenes are generally treated as a filled σ(out) orbital and an unfilled pure p orbital, even though the lone pairs of water could be described analogously by filled σ(out) and p orbitals (for further discussion, see the article on lone pair and the discussion above on sigma-pi and equivalent-orbital models). In other words, the type of localized orbital invoked depends on context and considerations of convenience and utility.

Deller OAM (born 3 November 1943 in Williamstown, Victoria) is a former Australian rules football field umpire and administrator who officiated over 200 matches in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1967 to 1981, and then served as Director of Umpiring from 1982 to 1997. Early years Born and raised in Williamstown, Deller began his football involvement with the Williamstown Football Club, as his father was a player and later trainer there. Deller played football and cricket at school and for local clubs Spotswood and Kingsville. He was encouraged to try his hand at the whistle after a friend recommended he attend the VFL's umpiring summer school for umpires. After graduating, Deller began his umpiring career in 1963 in the Dandenong juniors. By 1965, he was umpiring in the VFL reserves. His talent was recognized by observers, but questions remained about his fitness. At this time, Deller was still playing cricket in the summer. As a result, he lacked the endurance that a strong pre-season running program would have provided. Deller decided to concentrate on football, but was able to maintain his cricket commitments with the then Victorian Football League Umpires Association (VFLUA) club. Embarking on a training program with former VFL boundary umpire Arthur Cook, Deller's fitness and endurance improved significantly. By 1967, he was ready to umpire in the senior grade. VFL umpiring career Deller made his VFL senior grade debut in round 17 of the 1967 VFL season in a match between Essendon and Footscray at Windy Hill, a match in which the police attempted to arrest the Essendon runner, whom they mistook for a pitch invader from the crowd. Deller umpired his first finals match in 1971 – the second semi final between Hawthorn and St Kilda. He umpired his first Grand Final the following year between Carlton and Richmond. In 1974, Deller suffered a severe back injury which ruled him out for the entire season. He returned to action midway through the 1975 VFL season, and in 1976 was appointed along with Kevin Smith to co-umpire the Grand Final. This was the first Grand Final to be run by two field umpires. Deller retired from umpiring at the end of the 1981 VFL season. In total he umpired 251 senior VFL matches. This included 20 finals matches, five of which were Grand Finals. Director of Umpiring Immediately after retirement, Deller replaced Harry Beitzel as the part-time VFL Director of Umpiring. From 1987 to 1997, he was the Australian Football League (AFL) National Director of Umpiring. During his time in charge, Deller oversaw a series of major changes including: * The establishment of formalized courses of national accreditation for all categories of umpires in Australian rules football; * The introduction of a third field umpire; and * The introduction of video evidence to assist with player reports and tribunal hearings. In recognition of his on-field and off- field achievements, Deller has received numerous awards, including life membership of the AFL Umpires Association in 1975 and the AFL in 1993. In 1995, he was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his services to Australian rules football. Deller was one of the first umpires to be inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

He was the first African American to reach the rank of lieutenant colonel. He planted numerous churches, and in 1908 founded Allensworth, California, the only town in the state to be founded, financed and governed by African Americans. During the American Civil War, he escaped by joining the 44th Illinois Volunteers and later served two years in the navy. After being ordained as a minister, he worked as a teacher, studied theology and led several churches. In 1880 and 1884, he served as the only black delegate from Kentucky in the Republican National Conventions. In 1886, he gained an appointment as a military chaplain to a unit of Buffalo Soldiers in the West and served in the US Army for 20 years, retiring in 1906. In addition to his work in developing churches, he was notable for founding the township of Allensworth, California in 1908; it was intended as an all-black community. Although environmental conditions inhibited its success as a farming community and the residents abandoned it after a few generations, much of the former town has been preserved as the Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park. It marks the founders' dream and the thriving community that developed for some time. Biography =Early life and education= Born into slavery in Louisville, Kentucky in 1842, Allensworth was the youngest of thirteen children of Phyllis (c. 1782 - 1878) and Levi Allensworth. Over the years, their family was scattered: his sister Lila escaped with her intended husband to Canada by the Underground Railroad; and the older boys William, George, Frank, Levi and Major were sold downriver to plantations in the Deep South, which continued to buy enslaved workers from the Upper South to develop the cotton industry. Mary Jane was his only sibling who grew up in Kentucky and married there; she purchased her freedom in 1849, gaining stability.Charles Alexander, Battles and Victories of Allen Allensworth, Boston: Sherman, French & Company, 1914 (Electronic Edition), accessed 29 October 2011 His mother was held by A.P. and Bett Starbird. The mistress assigned Allen as a young slave to her son Thomas. When the Starbird boy started school, Allen began to learn from him, although it was illegal. After his father died when Allen was young, his mother chose to be sold as a cook to a neighbor, the attorney Nat Wolfe. When the Starbirds found Allen was learning to read, they separated him from their son and placed him with another family, the Talbots. Mrs. Talbot, a Quaker, was kind to Allen and continued to teach him to read and write; she also took him to a Sunday school for slave children. When Bett Starbird discovered this, she took Allen back. In 1854 she made arrangements with her husband's partner John Smith to send the boy to his brother Pat's plantation down the Mississippi River in Henderson, Kentucky, to put an end to his learning. On the steamboat, the boy was placed in the care of a slave steward rather than being chained with other slaves below deck. They were being transported for sale to downriver markets. Hebe Smith, Allen's new mistress, assigned him to be a houseboy; she prohibited him from continuing his studies, and whipped him for trying to do so. Also working in the household was a white orphan boy Eddie; the two boys became friends and helped each other. Suffering on the farm from a cruel overseer, in 1855 at age 13, Allen planned to escape to Canada. He spent two weeks hiding at a neighboring farm before returning to the Smiths for punishment. Later he ran away again. The Smiths and Starbirds agreed to sell him on the auction block in Henderson. Allensworth was sold again in Memphis, Tennessee and shipped to New Orleans. There he was bought by Fred Scruggs, who taught him to work as an exercise boy and jockey in Jefferson, Louisiana. Unlike others, his new master was pleased to learn that the boy could read; he assigned him to race his best horse. Civil War and freedom In early 1861 the Civil War loomed, but horse racing continued. Scruggs took Allen and his horses upriver for the fall meet in Louisville. Allensworth hoped to see his mother Phyllis again, as he had learned that her last master, a Rev. Bayliss, had freed her after she cared for his dying wife. He found that she had recently gone to New Orleans with a Union man to look for her sons. (She found Major in prison.) Waiting for her return, Allensworth was reunited with his sister Mary Jane, who had married and had a son. She had purchased her freedom in 1849. When Phyllis Starbird returned to Louisville, she and Allen were reunited. While working nearby on a farm where Scruggs' deputy had placed him, Allensworth met soldiers from the 44th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a Union unit encamped near Louisville. When he told them of wanting freedom, they invited him to join the Hospital Corps. In disguise, he marched with the unit past his old master through Louisville and off to war. After serving as a civilian nursing aide for some time, he was invited to accompany Dr. A. J. Gordon, one of the surgeons, to his home in Georgetown, Ohio. There Allensworth dined with Gordon's family, was given a room of his own, and felt he first walked as a free man. With the war continuing, in 1863 Allensworth enlisted in the US Navy, where he earned his first pay as a free man. He was soon promoted to Captain's steward and clerk, and served on the gunboats Queen City and Tawah for two years. Postwar years Allensworth first returned to Kentucky to work and study. In 1868 he joined his brother William in St. Louis, where they operated two restaurants. Within a short time, they received a favorable offer and sold them out; Allensworth returned to Louisville. He worked while putting himself through the Ely Normal School, one of several new schools in the South established by the American Missionary Association. During Reconstruction, Allensworth taught at schools for freedmen and their children operated by the Freedmen's Bureau. Inspired by his own teaching, he began attending courses at the Nashville Institute, later known as the Roger Williams University, but did not graduate. The school later gave him an honorary Master of Arts. Allensworth became involved with the Baptist Church in Louisville and attended the Fifth Street Baptist Church led by Henry Adams.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. pp. 843-846 He was ordained in 1871 by the Baptists as a preacher. In the 1870s, Allensworth went to Tennessee to study theology. During this time he also served as a preacher in Franklin, Tennessee, south of Nashville. In 1875, Allensworth started working as a teacher in Georgetown, Kentucky. He also served as the financial agent of the General Association of the Colored Baptists in Kentucky. They had joined together to support the founding of a religious school for black teachers and preachers. Allensworth was among the founders of The State University, helped guarantee the salary of the president in the early years, and served on the Board of Trustees. He returned to Louisville when called to be pastor of the Harney Street Baptist Church, which he reorganized, attracting many new members. They renamed it Centennial Baptist Church; it was selected as a model by the American Baptist Home Mission Society of America. Within a few years, Allensworth had increased the congregation nearly fivefold, and it built a new church. Marriage and family In 1877 he married Josephine Leavell (1855–1938), also born in Kentucky; they had met while studying at Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee. She was an accomplished pianist, organist and music teacher. They had two daughters together, Eva and Nella. The year of his marriage, Allensworth invited his mother to live with him and Josephine. They had several months together before she died in 1878 at the age of 96. Post-Reconstruction era Allensworth in 1887. Allensworth was called to the State Street Church in Bowling Green, Kentucky. He also gave public lectures. That fall, he went to Boston to give a series of lectures, after studying public speaking in Philadelphia. On his return, he met people from the American Baptist Publication Society in Philadelphia, who appointed him as Sunday School Missionary for the state of Kentucky. He had always worked to build up the Sunday Schools at his churches, and this gave him the chance to continue to work on education around the state. The Colored Baptist State Sunday School Convention of Kentucky appointed him to the position of State Sunday School Superintendent. With his leadership positions and public speaking, Allensworth became increasingly interested in politics. In 1880 and 1884, he was selected as Kentucky's only black delegate to the Republican National Conventions. Military career as chaplain In 1886, when he was 44, Allensworth gained support by both southern and northern politicians for appointment as a chaplain in the US Army; his appointment was confirmed by the Senate, as necessary at the time, and approved by the president. He was one of the few black chaplains in the US Army and was assigned to the 24th Infantry Regiment, known as the Buffalo Soldiers. His family accompanied him on assignments in the West, ranging from Fort Bayard, New Mexico Territory to Fort Supply, Indian Territory, and Fort Harrison, near Helena, Montana. His wife played organ in the fort chapels. At Fort Bayard, Allensworth wrote Outline of Course of Study, and the Rules Governing Post Schools of Ft. Bayard, N.M.. The Army adapted these for use as the standard manual on the education of enlisted personnel. By the time of his retirement in 1906, Allensworth had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, the first African American to gain that rank. Allensworth, California After the army, Allensworth and his family settled in Los Angeles. He was inspired by the idea of establishing a self-sufficient, all-black California community where African Americans could live free of the racial discrimination that pervaded post-Reconstruction America. His dream was to build a community where black people might live and create \\"sentiment favorable to intellectual and industrial liberty.\\" In 1908, he founded Allensworth in Tulare county, about thirty miles north of Bakersfield, in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. The black settlers of Allensworth built homes, laid out streets, and put up public buildings. They established a church, and organized an orchestra, a glee club, and a brass band. The Allensworth colony became a member of the county school district and the regional library system and a voting precinct. Residents elected the first African-American Justice of the Peace in post-Mexican California. In 1914, the California Eagle reported that the Allensworth community consisted of of deeded land worth more than US$112,500. Allensworth soon developed as a town, not just a colony. Among the social and educational organizations that flourished during its golden age were the Campfire Girls, the Owl Club, the Girls' Glee Club, and the Children's Savings Association, for the town's younger residents, while adults participated in the Sewing Circle, the Whist Club, the Debating Society, and the Theater Club. Col. Allensworth was an admirer of the African-American educator Booker T. Washington, who was the founding president and longtime leader of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Allensworth dreamed that his new community could be self-sufficient and become known as the \\"Tuskegee of the West\\". The Girls' Glee Club was modeled after the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, who had toured internationally. They were the community's pride and joy. All the streets in the town were named after notable African Americans and/or white abolitionists, such as Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, abolitionist and author of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The dry and dusty soil made farming difficult. The drinking water became contaminated by arsenic as the water level fell. The year 1914 also brought a number of setbacks to the town. First, much of the town's economic base was lost when the Santa Fe Railroad moved its rail stop from Allensworth to Alpaugh. In September, during a trip to Monrovia, California, Colonel Allensworth was crossing the street when he was struck and killed by a motorcycle. The town refuses to die. The downtown area is now preserved as Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park where thousands of visitors come from all over California to take part in the special events held at the park during the year. The area outside the state park is also still inhabited. Allensworth is the only California community to be founded, financed and governed by African Americans. The founders were dedicated to improving the economic and social status of African Americans. Uncontrollable circumstances, including a drop in the area's water table, resulted in the town's decline. =Legacy and honors= * The state has preserved the site and is gradually restoring its buildings. The most important building is the school house, which the community prized as representing the future of its children. In use until 1972, it is furnished as it would have been on a school day in 1915. The park arranges special events to celebrate the former community's history, and the park's visitor center features a film about the site. An annual re-dedication ceremony reaffirms the vision of the original pioneers. * Col. Allensworth's residence is preserved and furnished in the 1912-period style. It contains items from his life in the military service and the ministry. A small display of farm equipment is a reminder of the Allensworth economic base. * A public monument, designed by Ron Husband, has been funded by the City of Monrovia, California. =Death= Allen Allensworth died at the age of 72, on September 14, 1914.

After starting his career with local side Hednesford Town, O'Connor moved into the Scottish game with Scottish Premier League side Dundee United. From there he had a couple of loan spells, one with Greenock Morton and the other with Northern Irish side Portadown. Upon leaving the Arabs he had a spell with Queen of the South before heading back to England with Morecambe. Since leaving Morecambe in 2006, O'Connor has spent his time in the Scottish Football League, with Queen of the South again as well as their near neighbours Annan Athletic. Early career O'Connor was born in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. He started his career at non-league club Hednesford Town, working his way through the youth system before making his first team debut during the 1998–99 season. His form attracted the attention of a number of clubs, with Dundee United paying £30,000 for him in January 2000, despite O'Connor only playing in 14 matches for Hednesford. His chances at United were limited to only a handful of appearances and he was sent out on loan to gain first team experience elsewhere. After a short spell in Northern Ireland playing for Portadown, he came back to Scotland to have a similar spell with Morton. Before these loan spells he scored his first and only goal for Dundee United in a 3–2 win over Dunfermline. Queen of the South (1st & 2nd spells) In March 2002, O'Connor joined Queen of the South from Dundee United on a permanent contract.

He was an instant hit with the Queens faithful as he ended his first full season in Dumfries as top goalscorer. Injuries took their toll during his second full season at the club and O'Connor reluctantly rejected the offer of a new contract from Queens due to family reasons, at the end of 2003–04. O'Connor returned to England at the start of the 2004–05 season and signed a two-year contract with Morecambe, where injuries again restricted his playing time. He scored three league goals in only 16 appearances for the club. In 2006, O'Connor returned to Queen of the South, joining on a short-term deal, originally to prove his fitness. He played in all six of Queens' games in their run to the 2008 Scottish Cup Final, including the third goal in the 4–3 semi-final victory over Aberdeen at Hampden Park that took the club to their first-ever Scottish Cup Final in their 89-year history.\\"Club History\\" on the official Queen of the South website Barry Nicholson of Aberdeen later said that he felt O'Connor was Queens best player on the day.Barry Nicholson interview on www.qosfc.com In the 2008 Scottish Cup Final, as Queens trailed Rangers 2–0 at half time through goals by Kris Boyd and DaMarcus Beasley, O'Connor crossed the ball for Steve Tosh to score Queen of the South's first goal of the match in 50 minutes. The Doonhamers equalised in 52 minutes through club captain Jim Thomson. Kris Boyd scored his 2nd goal of the final and Rangers 3rd in 71 minutes to secure the Scottish Cup for Rangers. O'Connor scored in the home leg of Queen of the South's UEFA Cup 2nd qualification round match against FC Nordsjaelland after 28 minutes.

On 6 August 2012, the club confirmed that they had received the international clearance required and O'Connor had signed a one-year contract for the Pitmen.

Stretching south from Svartmangatan to Prästgatan, it is connected to Baggensgatan and Mårten Trotzigs Gränd, while forming a (somewhat) parallel street to Österlånggatan and Tyska Brinken. By the street are the public library and the major school (Storkyrkoskolan, \\"School of the Great Church\\" (e.g. Storkyrkan)) of the told town. While named a square, it undoubtedly remains a matter of taste and definition whether this elongated open space should be regarded as a street. History On either side of the street was the Blackfriars monastery from the 1330s to the Reformation (1520-1530). Archaeological excavations in the area have unveiled the remains of the monastery's wall under the present streets. In the southern end of Tyska Stallplan several such traces have been discovered, and in Prästgatan, south of the street, lines of cobble stones have been used to indicate the former extent of the monastery. Panoramic view of Tyska Stallplan in March 2007. The open space was surrounded by several stables during the 18th and 19th centuries, and it was accordingly called Stallplan (\\"Stable Plane\\") in 1820. In 1844, however, it is referred to as Stallplan äfven Tyska Skolg[atan] (\\"Stable Plane also German School Street\\"), and in 1870 as either Tyska Stallplan or Tyska Skolgatan (\\"German Stable Plane/School Street\\"). Obviously, the former somewhat misleading combination became the one used. The German School was, however, located on number 8, Själagårdsgatan. (See also Tyska Skolgränd.)

He joined the punk rock group, Radio Birdman (1976–78, 1995–96, 1997, 2005–07), then the hard rockers, the Hitmen (1978–84, 1989–92), and the Screaming Tribesmen (1984–89). Masuak has also been a member of New Christs (1983–84), the Juke Savages (1992–96), the Raouls (1996–97), and Klondike's North 40 (2002–present). He has released material as Chris Boy King and as Klondike. Radio Birdman were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in July 2007.  Biography  Christopher William Masuak, born in Kamloops, British Columbia in Canada, migrated to Australia by 1974 as a teenager. His nickname of \\"Klondike\\" came from his Canadian youth. He attended Maroubra Bay High School. Masuak was a member of J.K. and the Can Openers in 1974 and then joined the Jackals alongside Rubin Acosta, Archie Archilles, Alf Azzopardi, Johnny Kannis and Steve Willman during 1974 and 1975. According to Kannis the Jackals were \\"a school band that Chris Masuak and I started while we were in year 10 [with a] Maltese rhythm section.\\" They played cover versions of material by Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Blue Oyster Cult, Ted Nugent, Lou Reed and original country rock tracks written by Masuak, including \\"Death by the Gun\\". Kannis remembered that \\"Chris' guitar playing was so raw, original and his lead breaks took your head off!\\" After their third gig Masuak and Kannis met Deniz Tek of punk rockers, Radio Birdman, who jammed with them. In late 1976 Masuak joined Radio Birdman replacing Philip \\"Pip\\" Hoyle on guitar, vocals and piano; fellow members were Warwick Gilbert on bass guitar, Ron Keeley on drums, Tek on guitar and vocals, and Rob Younger on lead vocals. They issued their debut four-track extended play, Burn My Eye, in October. They followed with their first studio album, Radios Appear, in July 1977. They disbanded in June 1978 after recording their second album, Living Eyes in April, which was issued posthumously in early 1981. In November 1977, while still members of Radio Birdman, Masuak, Gilbert and Keeley, joined Kannis in Johnny and the Hitmen together with Charlie Georgees on guitar (ex- Hellcats). Early in 1978, when Radio Birdman were touring overseas, Kannis formed a new version of Johnny and the Hitmen which disbanded soon after. In July 1978, after Radio Birdman had dissolved, Masuak and Kannis revived the Hitmen with new members, Ivor Hay on drums (ex-the Saints) and Phil Sommerville on bass guitar. Gilbert rejoined in September, initially on rhythm guitar and took over bass guitar when Summerville left in the following year. Greg Falk of The Canberra Times caught a gig by the Hitmen in April 1979, they played \\"Hard and fast rock at an incredible volume became the norm for their presentation.\\" Most of the group's material was written by Masuak or Gilbert. They released three singles ahead of their debut self-titled album in July 1981 on WEA Records. Earlier Masuak explained that for the album, \\"we should just do our best, be ourselves and play on it representing our songs the way they should be represented.\\" They followed with a second album, It Is What It Is, in November 1982 but early in the next year they went into hiatus. Back in 1980 Masuak produced a single, \\"Cool in the Tube\\", for Surfside 6, a briefly existing punk pop group with the line up of Jolyon Burnett on lead vocals, Catherine Courtenay on bass guitar, Toby Creswell on keyboards, Geoff Datson on guitar, John Hackett on drums, Greg Masuak on guitar and Richard McGregor on guitar. He also wrote and produced their next single, \\"Can't You See the Sign\\", in 1981. In June 1983 Masuak teamed up with former Radio Birdman band mate, Younger, in a new line-up of his hard rock group, New Christs, with Mark Kingsmill on drums and Tony Robertson on bass guitar (both from a latter day version of the Hitmen) and Kent Steedman on guitar (also in the Celibate Rifles). They supported Iggy Pop on the Australian leg of his international tour. New Christs issued a single, \\"Like a Curse\\", in April 1984 before disbanding in the following month. In June Masuak and Kannis reformed the Hitmen with Kingsmill, Robertson and Richard Jakimyszyn on guitar (ex-Lime Spiders, New Christs). They recorded a live album, Tora Tora DTK, which was released in November, after they had disbanded. Masuak, Kingsmill and Robertson all joined Mick Medew, on lead vocals and guitars, in July 1984, for a new line up of his rock band, the Screaming Tribesmen. Masuak had previously produced that group's 1983 single, \\"Igloo\\". By November Kingsmill and Robertson had left and were replaced by Michael Charles on drums and Bob Wackley (aka Bob Hood) on bass guitar (ex-Razar, Grooveyard). The group's debut studio album, Bones and Flowers, released in October 1987, was co- produced by Masuak with Alan Thorne (Hoodoo Gurus, The Stems). Masuak remained with the group until 1989. While a member of the Screaming Tribesmen, Masuak undertook a side project, Chris Boy King and The Kamloops Swing, as a country rock group in 1986, which issued a four-track EP, Klondike, in the following year. The Kamloops Swing were Hay, Kannis and Sommerville. In 1989 he formed Klondike and the Kamloops Swing which released a six-track EP, Cowboy Angel. Helping him out on the EP were fellow Screaming Tribesmen, Wackley on bass guitar and Warwick Fraser on drums. Masuak and Kannis reformed the Hitmen as Hitmen D.T.K. in April 1989 with Gye Bennetts on drums (ex-Terminal Twist, Johnny Kannis Explosion), Brad Ferguson on bass guitar (ex-Voodoo Lust) and Matt Le Noury on guitar (ex-Vampire Lovers, Flying Tigers). They issued a studio album, Moronic Inferno, in November 1991 – co-produced by Masuak and Andy Bradley – and disbanded early in the next year. In April 1992 Masuak formed a country rock and R&B; group, Juke Savages, with Ferguson on drums and Paul Larsen on bass guitar. They released a self-titled CD EP in December. Ferguson and Larsen were replaced by Red Porter on bass guitar and Gerard Presland on drums (ex-Hitmen DTK), late in the next year. They released their debut studio album, Pagan Rites and Big Juju on the Road to Ascension, in 1994. Early in the following year Masuak worked with fellow Radio Birdman members to remaster and remix Radios Appear and Living Eyes for their CD versions. Alongside Masuak were Gilbert, Hoyle, Tek and Younger; Tek later recalled \\"we just realised it was pretty good to be together we've all stopped being psychotic, and we thought, 'Well, maybe we were a little bit hasty in terminating the association', because the music sounded pretty good, and we enjoyed each others' company.\\" Radio Birdman reformed in 1996 for the Big Day Out tour and recorded a live album, Ritualism, which appeared in December. In December 2005 Radio Birdman recorded a new album, Zeno Beach (26 June 2006), with the line-up of Masuak, Hoyle, Tek and Younger joined by Jim Dickson on bass guitar and Russell Hopkinson on drums (on loan from You Am I). The group were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in July 2007. They broke up again in 2010. Klondike's North 40 released their debut album, The Straight Path, on I-94 Bar Records in November 2007. It is a raw, high-powered romp amidst a series of rock and roll genres. Paying homage in part to middle eastern ragas, the album is essentially propped up by the truly superb vocals of journeyman soul singer Matt Sulman. Masuak continues to impress with finger work reminiscent of his early glory days. Bass player Red Porter creates a buoyant, yet maleable bed of groovaliscious solidity upon which the various talents of the band are highlighted. Masuak re-joined a new line-up of the Hitmen in December 2007. National tours followed, including an appearance at Cherry Rock in Melbourne and an Australian run with Detroit punk rock diva, Niagara, as special guest. Masuak re-located to Spain in January 2010 with European tours lined up as guest guitarist with French band the Outside and Brazil-based Simon Chainsaw. Before leaving Australia he completed work on his album \\"Workhorse\\" which was released in 2011 on I-94 Bar Records. In 2011, Masuak joined a reformed line-up of the Screaming Tribesmen for Australian shows, playing Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. The Bones and Flowers line-up toured Europe in 2012, playing Spain's Azkena Festival and four dates in France. In December 2013 and January 2014, Masuak played a string of solo band shows around Sydney. With a box set released, Radio Birdman reformed in October–November 2014. Masuak was omitted from the line-up. He described his disappointment, \\"There is absolutely no professional or musical impediment or rationale to preclude me from participating in this event. Rather, this decision is a result of a last desperate and bullying demand from a singer who's [sic] animosity towards me has spanned decades and whose antipathy towards the band is well documented.\\" Younger responded, \\"Are relations between the two of us simply unsalvageable? Yes – but I didn't exclude him from the band. He published a statement. I can understand why he'd be gutted by it, but my view is it would have been naive of him to think anything would've happened other than what has happened. I didn't exclude him from the band even though he thinks that's the case. I was offered to participate on the basis that he wasn't in the band.\\" In April 2016, Masuak released his new solo band CD, \\"Brujita\\", with his Spanish band The Viveiro Wave Riders on Australian label I-94 Bar Records.

Ghaffur and his family emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1972 after President Idi Amin forcibly expelled most of the country's minority South Asian population. Ghaffur's parents had previously emigrated from British India's Punjab region to Uganda during the Partition of India in 1947.Akbar, Arifa: 'My family came to Britain with £700 and reinvented themselves. But the scars remain', The Independent, 17 August 2003. Tarique's family was taken to a resettlement camp in Staffordshire. Two years later, in 1974, Ghaffur joined the newly formed Greater Manchester Police, where he worked in uniform and as a CID detective. One of only two police officers from a minority ethnic background out of a force of over 6,000, Ghaffur asserted that the desk sergeant on his first day with the police refused him admission to the station as he did not believe he was a police officer.John, Cindi: Profile: Tarique Ghaffur, BBC News, 7 August 2006.

He was appointed Assistant Chief Constable in Lancashire Constabulary. After reaching the rank of Deputy Chief Constable at Lancashire, he transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service in 1999 as a Deputy Assistant Commissioner and in 2000 served as Borough Commander of the City of Westminster.

He is currently dean of the London Community College of Education, Board of Directors LCCE a private college in London. Controversies The UK's highest-ranking Asian Muslim police officer, he often used his position to comment on issues of alleged racism in the police service, and on alleged discrimination against Muslims as a factor inciting radical Islam.Muslim Met chief gets 'hate mail', BBC News, 25 August 2006. In June 2008 he accused his own force of racism, claiming that, inter alia, he was not properly consulted over the proposed law involving 42-day detentions for terror suspects.Top Asian officer in race claim, BBC News, 25 June 2008. The MPS rejected the claim of racism and said it would \\"robustly challenge\\" Mr Ghaffur's claim at any employment tribunal. In 2005 Tarique Ghaffur and Sir Ian Blair were involved in Operation Finnean, the investigation into supermodel Kate Moss's alleged possession and distribution of a Class A drug. It has been alleged that the operation was systematically sabotaged by officers eager to undermine Ghaffur and Blair's high-profile stance on celebrity drug taking, and thereby erode their authority.Fred Vermorel, Addicted to Love: the Kate Moss Story, Omnibus Press, second edition, 2007, pp 198–206 () On 28 August 2008, Ghaffur held a press conference at which he accused the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, of racism and discrimination, and confirmed speculation that he would take proceedings against Sir Ian and the MPS at an employment tribunal.Dodd, Vikram: Top Asian officer sets out race case and directly blames Met police chief, The Guardian, 29 August 2008. In the following days, Ghaffur claimed, he received death threats which he claims to believe come (in part) from within the MPS. As a consequence he says he considered a leave of absence, and his lawyers hired a firm of private bodyguards to secure his safety. Although he has disclosed them in the media, Ghaffur has not reported these death threats to the police, claiming that he has lost faith in the ability and willingness of the police to protect him. On 25 November 2008, the Metropolitan Police Authority confirmed that Tarique Ghaffur had agreed an out-of-court settlement for £300,000 in his racial discrimination claim against Scotland Yard. Both parties agreed to a confidentiality clause and Ghaffur retired from the Metropolitan Police on 27 November 2008. Education Ghaffur studied at Manchester Metropolitan University and graduated BA (Hons) in Public Administration and MA in Criminology.

He is considered a member of the Vienna School of Art History.  Biography  Novotny studied art history at the University of Vienna under Josef Strzygowski, and wrote his dissertation on the Romanesque architectural sculpture in the apse of the Pfarrkirche in Schöngrabern, in Lower Austria. Beginning in 1927 he worked as an assistant at Strzygowski's institute. In 1937 he received his habilitation with a study of Cézanne und das Ende der wissenschaftlichen Perspektive (Cézanne and the end of scientific perspective), which became a standard study of the French painter and established Novotny as an internationally recognized expert on his work. As a result of this book, Novotny made the acquaintance of the painter Gerhart Frankl, whose own work was stylistically influenced by Cézanne, but had also struggled with his French forebearer through his statements on the theory of art. A lifelong friendship between Novotny and Frankl developed out of this initially professional conversation, and the two maintained an extensive correspondence. When Frankl had to flee to England in 1938, he attempted to also bring Novotny out of Austria, which in the meantime had been annexed to Nazi Germany. However, Novotny did not wish to leave his aged mother and his ill sister behind, and so he decided to remain in Vienna. Despite his uncompromising anti-fascist attitude, in 1939 Novotny received a position at the Österreichische Galerie in Schloss Belvedere, where he served as interim director for two years immediately after the end of the war. From 1960 until 1968 he served again as director of the Galerie, where he mounted a series of well-attended exhibitions that introduced the population of Vienna to the great masters of modern painting. From 1948, Novotny taught at the University of Vienna as a Professor extraordinarius. On the occasion of his retirement in 1978, he was honored with the title of Professor ordinarius. As a board member of the Adalbert Stifter Society, Novotny occupied himself with the artistic works of the Austrian poet, and founded a small museum, which today forms a part of the Vienna Museum (the municipal museum of the city of Vienna). Novotny's study of Cézanne has been described as \\"the most disciplined exercise in the formal-analytic method\\" that was associated with the Vienna School of Art History in the mid-20th century.C.S. Wood, The Vienna School Reader: politics and art historical method in the 1930s (New York, 2000), p. 42.

The route encounters no named roads along its route, aside from its eastern terminus at Secondary Highway 527. It extends westward into the wilderness, ending at a bridge over the Weaver River. The route was designated in 1976 with the intention of extending it further west, but this extension has yet to be constructed.  Route description  Branching off from Secondary Highway 527, roughly halfway between Thunder Bay and Armstrong, Highway 811 is Ontario's highest numbered route, but also one of its most remote. Aside from its beginning, the highway connects with no named roads along its length. The route begins approximately midway along Highway 527, north of Ontario Highway 17 and south of Armstrong, It zig-zags northwestward for towards Savant Lake, although as of 2011 the road reaches less than halfway there. It crosses several small rivers as it travels through the Boreal Forest before ending at a bridge over the Weaver River, south of Obonga-Ottertooth Provincial Park. The road is gravel for its entire length. There are no communities along Highway 811; it is almost exclusively used for wilderness travel or forest operations.  History  As part of the 1974 Ontario Highway Capital Construction Program, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications studied the potential benefit of a road connecting Highway 527 southwest of Lake Nipigon with Highway 599 near Savant Lake. A forest road that branched off from Highway 527 was assumed as Highway 811 in 1976. However, the planned connection to Highway 599 has yet to occur, and an gap separates Savant Lake from the Weaver River. Despite no connection materializing over the past 35 years, and no plans to construct that connection presently, Highway 811 remains a signed and maintained provincial highway.

The first section runs from a lower station at Kornmarkt in Heidelberg's Altstadt, via an intermediate station at Heidelberg Castle, to an upper station at Molkenkur. Here passengers may change to the second section, which runs up the Königstuhl, a nearby mountain with good views over the city and the River Neckar. The upper and lower sections of the funicular have different histories and are sometimes referred to separately by the names Königstuhlbahn and Molkenkurbahn respectively. These two sections present quite different appearances, with the upper section using wooden bodied cars of historic appearance, whilst the lower section uses modern style cars. Similarly the upper stations at Molkenkur and Königstuhl are to the original design, whilst those further down the hill at Kornmarkt and Heidelberg Castle present a more modern image. The Heidelberger Bergbahn is operated by the Heidelberger Straßen- und Bergbahn AG (HSB), the operator of buses and trams in Heidelberg. The funicular predominantly serves tourist traffic. The lower section runs every ten minutes throughout the day, whilst the connecting upper section runs every twenty minutes throughout the day. The services start at 9 a.m. and end at times that vary from summer to winter.

While at Mayne, and against long-standing practice in Australian hospitals, Smedley undertook a ruthless campaign of cost-cutting which included the centralisation of the group's hospital management. This resulted in an alienation of the hospitals' primary customers, their specialist doctors, who then referred their patients to other health care providers.

(2007) Taxonomy This is a monotypic species. All Tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Etymology Nothoprocta comes from two Greek words, nothos meaning spurious or counterfeit and prōktos meaning hindpart or tail. Experts are unsure, however, they believe that this refers to the hidden tail of this Genus behind body feathers. Also, taczanowskii is the Latin form of Władysław Taczanowski's name, used to commemorate him.Gotch, A. F. (1995) Description Taczanowski's tinamou is a dark, and finely-marked tinamou. Its head and neck are grey with blackish crown and face markings with a pale greyish buff throat. Its upper parts are dusky with thin, buff stripes and inconspicuous brown barring with black and buff mottling on its wing-coverts. It has tawny flight feathers, barred blackish. Its breast is grey with buffy spots bordered black. The rest of its under parts are buff, barred dusky with a long, blackish, curved bill. The young are generally richer in brown color. The average size of this tinamou is .BirdLife International (2008) Behavior The species has a loud, cackling cuyy-cuyy voice when flushed. It frequently feeds on tuber crops, especially potatoes. Eggs and chicks have been collected in April and May and October. The male incubates the eggs and raises the chicks. The nest is located on the ground. Range The Taczanowsi's tinamou is found in the eastern Andes, or more precisely, (Cordillera Oriental) in Peru, from Junín to Puno.Clements, J. (2007) In Peru, there are records from several sites in Apurímac, Cuzco and Puno, but it has not been recorded in the Chincheros / Pampa valley area, northwest Apurímac, since 1970. The Wansu mountain range, southern Apurímac, has produced only one specimen (collected in 1977) and those from the northern Kallawaya mountain range in the Puno Region were taken in 1871. It has been recorded from the Marayniyuq area, Junín Region, but there have probably not been any surveys since the last records in 1939. The species was recorded for the first time in Bolivia in 1999, when one male was collected and three to four juveniles observed in Apolobamba Integrated Management Natural Area, La Paz. Habitat Taczanowski's tinamou inhabits high altitude grassland and shrubland at altitude . It may also be found at pastureland and arable land. Conservation Taczanowski's tinamou is currently listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Their survival is threatened by degrading of its habitats caused by human activities, such as frequent burning of grassland, and cutting, burning and livestock-grazing in high-altitude copses and shrubby patches. The species is also hunted by people for food. There have been surveys of its high- altitude habitats, and measures have been proposed for their conservation such as regulate the use of fire, reintroduce old high-yielding agricultural techniques, restrict grazing, facilitate low-impact ecotourism and associated trades to generate income for the local people, encourage local people to take a leading role in land-use management and restoration schemes. It was also proposed to make social and political reforms to deal with existing land-right conflicts, and encourage sustainable use on a large scale. The species has been protected in Ampay Forest National Sanctuary, and in Bolivian Apolobamba Integrated Management Natural Area.

History The ship was built at Wärtsilä Hietalahti Shipyard in Helsinki, Finland in 1938 and was at the time a modern, icebreaking inspection vessel. The vessel was the first inspection vessel in independent Finland, built by the Finns for the National Board of Navigation, and her year of manufacture is the same as that of the icebreaker Sisu. She was originally known as Inspection vessel SS Turku and was built to the hull designs of SS Sisu, the only alterations being that of the scale. Thus SS Ukkopekka is probably the last sea-going passenger steamer designed for icebreaking still in active service. The original engine of SS Ukkopekka was a triple expansion steam engine, built in Helsinki in 1937, and originally designed for warships by the Germans. This engine is probably the last one in active use in the whole world. The engine is in very good condition, as the Finnish state took very good care of it. The boiler was renewed in 1976. The hull is surveyed every two years and it is still in excellent condition—thanks to the high quality steel of 1937. Soon after she had been built, SS Turku was transferred to military service. The ship served during the Winter War (1939–1940). Despite the extreme conditions of that very harsh winter, the ship was in active service almost without a break. During the Continuation War (1941–1944), the vessel served as a convoy ship in the Åland Sea. After the war, the vessel returned to her original task, serving the National Board of Navigation (pilotage service) as a maintenance and inspection vessel on the Archipelago Sea. Pilot training was part of the daily routine on board, and so was sea mark maintenance. In her home port, the lower steamship port of Turku, the coal trimmer soon became the subject of many letters to the editor and received complaints from the residents of apartment houses on the banks of the Aura River, who claimed that the soot from her chimneys made their laundry dirty. As a result, the coal stores were replaced by oil containers in 1976, and the boiler hatches were replaced with oil-driven blowers. The rest of the engine has been preserved unaltered, in its original shape. In fact there are five steam engines altogether: the main engine, winch engine, rudder engine and two water pumps. People interested in steam engines come from all over the world to admire this \\"museum piece\\", which still is in excellent condition and in active use, and probably will remain so for decades. The Finnish state gave up the vessel in 1979, when a new, larger and more modern inspection vessel was built. After some alteration work on deck and inside the vessel, steamship traffic was reintroduced in the Turku region in the spring of 1986. This marked the first return of traditional steaming in the area since the 1950s. In the winter of 1987–1988, the ship saloons were enlarged and renovated. The kitchen and storage facilities were also renovated to meet modern requirements and service standards. Image:SS Ukkopekka waitress.jpgSS Ukkopekka.

It lies on the Otava River, some to the South-East from the region capital of Plzeň. It has about 5,200 inhabitants. Horažďovice is also a Municipality with Extended Competence and a Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority within the same borders. History A fortified settlement was established here in the 10th century and two centuries later the stone castle became an administrative centre of the Prácheň region (embracing today’s region of Horažďovice, Sušice, Kašperské Hory, Strakonice and Vimperk). When the stronghold lost its significance, the centre was moved to a settlement on the Otava river. Around 1200, St. Peter's Church was constructed in Horažďovice along with a fortress in the surrounding neighborhood which was connected by a wooden bridge. The king Wenceslaus II of Bohemia gave the settlement the status and rights of town in the year 1292. Horažďovice's location along the trade route from Prague to Bavaria Trade ensured a promising future for Horažďovice. One of the most significant families with a large impact on the history of the settlement was the Bavor House of Strakonice, who built a Gothic fortress here in the 13th century. The town enjoyed great prosperity in the second half of the 15th century, when the ownership was taken over by Půta Švihovský from Rýzmberk. He initiated development of administrative centres in the town vicinity such as the castles Rabí, Švihov and Velhartice. The greatest disaster for Horažďovice was the Thirty Years' War, when there was damage caused by two large fires and the town was twice plundered by Swedish troops. The badly damaged castle was rebuilt, the monastery was enlarged and a chapel by Loreta was built during the Šternberks reign in the 17th century. The 13th century fortification included a Baroque castle which was rebuilt during the Švihovský reign as a Renaissance castle, with the only remains being cellars carved in the rock and a rotund tower. Since 1920, the castle houses a town museum. An important monument is the Convent church of the Virgin Mary standing on the site of the former chapel of St. Michael from the 13th century. For almost 100 years it was the seat of The Order of sisters of Notre Dame for the whole country. After 1989 The Order returned. Near the town, on the hill Prácheň, is the Church of St. Kliment - the ninth Christian church in Bohemia, probably consecrated by Metoděj. The Rummerskirchs had a significant impact on the town by introducing pearl oysters farming in the 19th century. The collecting of pearls was organised by the gentry and was even attended by the Emperor František I. in the years 1809 and 1818. In the last pearl oyster harvest in 1944, 20,000 oysters were opened. After the Second World War the farming of pearl oysters declined. The last owners of the township were the Kinskys of Vchynice and Tetov. They laid out a garden in the style of English park with many rare specimens of trees and plants. The English park is called Ostrov today. The Kinskys owned the township until 1945. Jewish Merchants were notable as the source of much of Horažďovice's commerce during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Jewish Community A Jewish presence in Horažďovice is believed to have existed from ancient times and the first written reference to the Jewish community is contained in the records of the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648) which indicate that 10 Jewish families were present in 1618. Archival evidence indicates that a Jewish cemetery existed in 1619. The first synagogue and Jewish school were founded in 1684. Officially banned from guilds, the early Jewish residents were farmers and traders. The earliest Jewish homes were concentrated in an area that is now called Prácheňská Street. The Jews of Horažďovice were subject to orders and decrees that made life extraordinarily difficult throughout much of their entire history.In the 17th century, the number of Jewish residents in Horažďovice was limited to 10 families, partially in an effort to discourage competition for local tradesmen. Renting homes to Jews was strictly prohibited. In the late 17th century, an edict prohibited the Jews from allowing their cattle to graze with the communal herd. In 1687, Jews were targeted further with special taxes, prohibitions on carrying firearms and an edict requiring Jews to wear a yellow cloth badge. The most far-reaching restrictions on Horažďovice's Jews were a series of measures known as the Family Laws \\"Familianten\\", introduced by Austrian Emperor Charles VI in 1726 and designed to limit Jewish population numbers. All marriages between Jews required the State’s permission. No Jew under the age of 30 could marry and only the eldest male in each family was permitted to do so. The repeal of the Family Laws in the mid 1800s launched what many regard as the \\"golden age\\" of Horažďovice Jewry. By 1890, the Jewish community reached its peak population of 300 – 9% of the total population. The influence of the Jewish community however was far greater as they were the driving force behind much of Horažďovice’s Industrial Revolution. In 1873, Samuel Kohn opened a matchstick factory that produced matches with colourful wax heads in decorative boxes for export to the east. On the adjacent property, a paper manufacturing plant owned by Rud, Firth and Bernard Gans was particularly important as it employed many workers and purchased straw from local farmers. In 1898, Heřman Steiner, Zikmund Friedler and Josef Geschmay opened a starch factory which was so successful that it inspired potato farmers across Bohemia to form an agricultural cooperative, which purchased the factory in 1912. It still operates as LYCKEBY AMYLEX and is the largest producer of potato starch in the Czech Republic. The best known Jewish business in Horažďovice’s was the vinegar and spirits company \\"Münz Brothers\\" founded by Simon Münz in 1831 and famed for its \\"Münzovka\\" whiskey. Expanded by his sons, Eduard and Karel Münz, and later by František and Pavel Münz, it became the largest distributor of spirits and vinegar in the region and was the sole distributor of almost all foreign wines and domestic mineral waters. In 1859, Heřman Katz founded what was to become the largest grocery mercantile house in southern Bohemia. In 1907, his son Otto Katz founded a wholesale grocery house which was as prosperous as his father’s. A significant number of Jews emigrated from Horažďovice from 1850 to 1938, particularly to the USA, Australia and South America, some inspired by the community’s international business perspective. Adolph Sabath, emigrated to the US in 1881 aged 15 and served in the US House of Representatives for 48 years representing the 5th Congressional district of Illinois. In 1880, Sigmund Eisner emigrated to the US from Horažďovice aged 21 with the family sewing machine. By 1922 the Sigmund Eisner Company in Red Bank, NJ became the largest manufacturer of uniforms in the US with over 2,000 employees; it became the exclusive supplier for the Boy Scouts of America after providing uniforms for the Spanish–American War. His great-grandson Michael Eisner was CEO of the Walt Disney Company from 1984 to 2005. During WW II, the Jewish Community was deported by German military authorities as part of The Final Solution. 93 Horažďovice Jews were transferred via railway on transport Cd to Terezín on November 26, 1942. Six Jews were deported by other means. Only seven survived. No Jewish community exists in Horažďovice today. In 2014, Westminster Synagogue in London, which holds one of the surviving torah scrolls from the Horažd’ovice Synagogue, received permission from the town to place memorial stones \\"Stolpersteine\\" in front of the homes of Jewish families who were deported by German military in WW II and perished. To date, 15 \\"Stolpersteine\\" designed by artist Gunter Demnig have been placed at three homes in two separate ceremonies under the auspices of the Horažďovice municipal authority.

Around 1802 he went into partnership with the printer Charles Mitchell forming Lavenu & Mitchell and in 1805 moved their business to New Bond Street. The partnership with Mitchell ended in 1806, and Lavenu built up a successful business attaining a Royal Warrant as music seller to the Prince Regent (later George IV) by his death on 17 August 1818. Lavenu had married Elizabeth Mackenzie of Greenwich on 3 March 1793 at St George Hanover Square, Westminster. She died on 16 January 1814 and Lavenu married for a second time a woman named Eliza, the mother of his son Lewis Henry Lavenu. The business was further built upon by Eliza who went into partnership with the Anglo-Italian violinist Nicolas Mori. The business was moved to 24, Edward Street, Manchester Square in 1820, the Bond Street premises then being occupied by William Mitchell, the son of Charles Mitchell who had originally been in partnership with Lavenu.

The film only had limited screenings upon its release and never saw a general theatrical release, but has since become widely available on DVD. The film is a loose remake of the 1939 Frank Capra film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and is directed by Laughlin under the on-screen pseudonym \\"T.C. Frank\\". Plot Billy Jack (Tom Laughlin) is appointed a United States Senator to fill out the remaining term of another senator. It is hoped that he will quietly vote the party line, but his term in the Senate runs into trouble when he proposes a bill to fund a national youth camp which happens to be on the property where a nuclear power plant is also being proposed. His fellow senator, Joseph Paine (E. G. Marshall), claims to oppose nuclear power but is secretly taking graft to influence his votes in favor, and moves to try to keep Billy Jack out of the way when the bill is being debated. Seeking to keep Billy out of the Senate on a day when a controversial energy bill is being voted on, Senator Paine suggests he should meet with a grassroots group that day instead. The group is working to pass a national initiative and Billy Jack becomes convinced of their cause. Billy is invited to meet with a group of lobbyists attempting to offer him bribes and other perks if he will vote their way. Up against a man named Bailey (Sam Wanamaker) who wields a powerful influence in his home state, Billy Jack has his political career and reputation at stake if he does not cooperate. Billy responds with anger at their threat. The next day in the Senate, he tries to speak on the floor in opposition to the nuclear power plant. Paine responds by proposing to expel Billy from the Senate as unfit for office. Billy's assistant quits after the murder of a lobbyist, fearing for her own safety, but returns after Billy Jack is about to be expelled from the Senate, to help him learn Senate procedure in order to filibuster. Billy collapses on the Senate floor in the effort, whereupon Paine confesses to his colleagues that every word Billy spoke was the truth. Cast  * Tom Laughlin as Billy Jack * E. G. Marshall as Paine * John Lawlor * Lucie Arnaz as Saunders * Delores Taylor as Jean * Suzanne Somers as Sue * Sam Wanamaker as Bailey * Peter Donat as Butler * Pat O'Brien as the Vice President Production  As with the two previous films in the series, Laughlin's wife Delores Taylor and daughter Teresa Laughlin reprise their roles. Julie Webb and several other supporting actors from Billy Jack and The Trial of Billy Jack return as well. Author and political journalist Joe Klein appears briefly as a reporter in the opening scene. (Klein became friends with Laughlin after interviewing him for Rolling Stone in 1975.) James Stewart, who starred in the original Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, was offered a prominent role in this film; as he was by this point severely hard of hearing, he declined the offer.Newsmax's Top 50 Movies Celebrating American Values “ “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” (1939) — (...) was loosely remade by Tom Laughlin as “Billy Jack Goes to Washington” 1977 for which Stewart declined the lead.” A new version of the song \\"One Tin Soldier\\" (the original theme for Billy Jack) sung by Teresa Laughlin is played over the closing credits. Release  Billy Jack Goes to Washington was a failure, partly due to distribution problems, and it proved to be Laughlin's last film as a director. Scenes featuring Suzanne Somers and William Wellman Jr. were cut from the DVD release, which is missing 40 minutes. Wellman's cut scenes had him reprising the national guardsman he played in The Trial of Billy Jack, who was now on the board of the Freedom School's directors. Reception Variety wrote, \\"By comparison with the spine-tingling emotionalism and technical brilliance of the Capra version, the pic is much flatter and largely devoid of performing or visual nuances. Most of the humor is gone, and the characters are thinned out, replaced with a rhetorical talkathon interspersed with a few chopsocky sequences.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Billy Jack Goes To Washington\\". Variety. April 20, 1977. 24. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post described the film as \\"a talky, static, derivative picture that seems to run on forever,\\" adding, \\"Laughlin relies so heavily on the original plot and dialogue of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' that one may feel a little embarrassed on his behalf. It's obvious that he's used the Capra film as a crutch rather than an inspiration.\\"Arnold, Gary (May 12, 1977). \\"Billy Jack: Running His Act Into The Ground\\". The Washington Post. 62.

The TRZ is recognised as having a much higher diversity of rare and endemic plant species than the other Zones. The Zones were first defined by Stephen Hopper in his 1979 paper Biogeographical aspects of speciation in the southwest Australian flora. Initially, they were defined in terms of rainfall, with the TRZ being that part of the South West with annual rainfall of between 300 and 800 millimetres (12–31 in). However, following the publication of John Stanley Beard's phytogeographic regionalisation of Western Australia in 1980, it was recognised that Hopper's zones could be defined as aggregates of Beard's botanic districts. The Transitional Rainfall Zone was subsequently re-defined as equivalent to Beard's Roe, Avon and Irwin Botanical Districts, later renamed Northern Sandplains Region, Wheat Belt Region and Mallee Region respectively. When the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) was published in the 1990s, Beard's regionalisation was adopted as the baseline for Western Australia. All three of the TRZ regions were accepted as IBRA regions, albeit with slightly different titles. Thus the TRZ is now defined as the aggregate of the Geraldton Sandplains, Avon Wheatbelt and Mallee IBRA regions. The TRZ is widely recognised as having very high species diversity and endemism compared to the other zones. Some botanists have claimed that this is due to the species richness of the near-coastal heathlands at the north-western and south-eastern extremes of the zone, suggesting that the intervening Wheatbelt region is relatively species poor. Other botanists have refuted this, however, claiming that the entire TRZ is species rich compared to the other zones.

He originally joined Wasps replacing Stephen Jones who returned to the Scarlets. At the age of 30 Blackett became the youngest coach in the Championship in 2013 when, at age 30 the Rotherham Titans appointed him. Previously he was a wing and centre at Rotherham, while also playing the role of captain for the team. After his stint with Rotherham as wing he spent six seasons playing for Leeds Tykes in the Premiership. His usual position is at wing or centre. He went to school at King Edward VII and Queen Mary School in Lytham, and played some of his earlier rugby at Fylde Rugby Club. He was appointed interim head coach of Wasps in February 2020 after it was announced Dai Young had stepped down from first team coaching duties. A role which was later made permanent. Background Yorkshire Carnegie Tykes initially signed Blackett, a former Rotherham Titans captain, near the end of the 2005/2006 season, on loan. He was traded with prop James Isaacson who went to Rotherham. He made his debut for the Tykes against Leicester Tigers on 10 March 2006 in the 2005-06 Guinness Premiership and he made a further 2 appearances that season. He is a popular player and has many nicknames. These are generally based around his uncanny resemblance to famous figures; namely Leo Cullen of Leinster and Ireland, Ian Dowie (retired footballer) and most notably, Earthworm Jim. A product of the Rotherham Titans Academy, Blackett was one of the Titans more consistent players after breaking through to the first XV, going onto make 50 appearances for the club and later being honoured with the role of captain at just the age of 23. Blackett gained representative honours with the England Counties XV and was part of the squad that went on tour to South America. He spent four seasons with the Titans, gaining some Premiership experience with the side in 2004 when he made his full senior debut against Bath. Blackett went on to make a handful of appearances before the side were eventually relegated. In the National Division One he established himself as the first choice No. 12 and in the 2004–05 campaign was an almost ever present making 24 appearances for the side and scoring five tries, two of these coming against Plymouth Albion in Rotherham's 24–18 league victory. Blackett has plenty of experience playing in the National Division One and whilst with Rotherham was regarded as one of the division's top players, with a strong reputation as a reliable defender. Despite only joining the Tykes until the end of the 2005–06 season, Blackett was one of the few players who committed their future to the club at the end of the season; which ended in relegation. Blackett attended and represented Sheffield Hallam University's 1st XV in rugby union where he played alongside Sean Lamont & David Strettle. On 21 March 2008, Blackett scored the Guinness Premiership's fastest ever try against Newcastle Falcons in the 2007-08 Guinness Premiership, crossing the try line after just 8.2 seconds.

The film, which received a limited release in North America on April 20, 2007, focuses on the issue of teenage pregnancy. Stephanie Daley was developed at the Sundance Writers' and Filmmakers' Lab, and premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. The film also earned Tamblyn a nomination for best supporting female at the 2006 Independent Spirit Awards and the Leopard prize for best actress at the 2006 Locarno film festival. Plot Sixteen-year-old Stephanie Daley collapses in a pool of blood while on a school skiing trip. A doctor discovers that in the blood is afterbirth. Soon afterward, the body of a newborn baby girl is found in a toilet, its mouth blocked with toilet paper. Despite Stephanie's insistence that her child was stillborn and that she had no idea that she was pregnant, she is arrested for the murder of the child and becomes known as the Ski-Mom. Awaiting trial, Stephanie is interviewed by a forensic psychologist, Lydie Crane, who is also approximately 30 weeks pregnant with a son. Lydie is hired by the Prosecution to make an independent evaluation of Stephanie. When Lydie first meets the Daley family, Stephanie's mother is quick to stipulate that Stephanie will not accept a plea bargain. Lydie is eager to get to know Stephanie. Lydie suspects her husband is having an affair after finding an earring that doesn't belong to her in their home; their marriage has been on the rocks since she gave birth to a stillborn child three months before she conceived the child she is now pregnant with. As Stephanie discusses her sexual history and her relationship with her parents and her child, Lydie is forced to face her hitherto buried emotions about her own child. Through her interviews with Lydie, Stephanie talks about the father of her baby, Cory, a boy she met at a party and then slept with and never saw again because he enlisted in the Marines. When Lydie asks Stephanie if she knew she was pregnant, Stephanie avoids the questions and claims she was being \\"punished\\" by God because she was \\"weak\\", and that the pregnancy was a \\"test\\". Visibly annoyed at this, Lydie reveals to Stephanie that she had a baby girl a year before who had been stillborn, and asks Stephanie what she thinks Lydie was being punished for. Stephanie replies \\"you tell me.\\" The truth is told through flashbacks, when Stephanie is on the ski trip at her school, (none of her friends know of her pregnancy; and she doesn't reveal it to anyone) she begins to go into labour and makes it to the bathroom, where she quietly but painfully delivers the child on her own, and it is revealed through Lydie's explanation that the baby fell into the leg of Stephanie's ski pants. Stephanie says she wrapped the baby in toilet paper and left it there, but still maintains she was dead. Meanwhile, Lydie confronts her husband about the affair; he claims he has not slept with anyone, but has indeed thought about it. He also blames the problems in their marriage on Lydie having not properly grieved for their stillborn daughter (she confides in a friend that when their stillborn daughter was cremated, in a fit of anger during an argument with her husband on the drive home, Lydie opened the window and just tossed the ashes out) and says that she does not truly want the baby she is carrying. Lydie screams in his face that she does want the child. Soon before her trial, Stephanie is getting a glass of water and a car drives by her house with drunk young men in it who scream out, \\"Be the mother of my baby!\\" and drive off laughing, Stephanie having gained notoriety as being the Ski-Mom. This event makes Stephanie break the glass in her hand and cut her palm, severely upsetting her mother. Before the trial begins, Stephanie returns to Lydie and says she is going to accept a plea bargain. Lydie states that she thinks this is a good idea and reaches out to shake Stephanie's hand when she notices the cut and asks what happened. Stephanie then tearfully admits the truth to Lydie, that her baby girl was alive when she delivered her, but was so small, and \\"her breathing was all wrong\\", and so in her mind she told her child to die, and she did. Stephanie believes she did kill her baby with her mind. Lydie hugs Stephanie, then thanks her.

It had two platforms. After the takeover of the West Lancashire Railway by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway on 1 July 1897 it was renamed Hutton and Howick on 1 December 1897. The station received a new signal box in 1901. The coming of the railway attracted a settlement around the station which grew into the village of New Longton. The rapid growth of this village was the reason why the station was renamed New Longton and Hutton by the London and Midland Railway on 5 October 1934. Following the Beeching report, the station was closed to goods on 6 April 1964 and to passengers on 7 September 1964, together with the whole line.

It is the last pairing of Terence Hill (who also directed) and Bud Spencer. Plot Travis, a gunslinger receives a letter from his mother Maw, asking him to bring his brother Moses and his family to a Christmas reunion and to give them an unknown treasure she claims to have inherited it from his father. Moses is a bounty hunter, who is angry at Maw, for letting his stolen horses loose, forcing Travis to set up a plan. Travis saves an outlaw named Sam Stone from being hanged and teams up with his brother to catch him. When the brothers stay at Moses' family's house, Travis gives them plans to get to Maw's. When they head off the next morning, Moses' family heads on their way to Maw's. While passing some time at a town, Travis gets into a fist fight with a man, named Dodge and his gang, who were teasing a young woman. Moses unwillingly comes and helps Travis finish them off. The woman, Bridget invites the brothers to have cookies and tea with her and her sister, Melie. After leaving and setting up camp, Travis finds Stone and gang, talking about robbing a bank, the next day at noon. The next day, the brothers plan a trap to catch Stone. The plan backfires when they come in at the wrong time. The sheriff and his deputy mistake Travis and Moses as part of Stone's gang and arrest them. Bridget bails Travis out, revealing that Stone took their beloved bear. When Moses is sentenced to hang the next morning, Travis tries to free him in the same way he freed Stone (shooting the noose.) A dog attacks Travis and Moses is hanged, but due to his enormous size, he destroys the gallows. Moses survives with only a few splinters. He comes up with a plan to catch Stone, but the plan fails and they are captured. Travis reveals to Stone that he saved his life, and Stone lets them go. Moses comes up with plan B, which works. When Moses falls asleep, Travis frees Stone and Stone dummy- ties him. Moses abandons Travis, but he hitches a ride from nearby Navajo Indians. Moses' son, Junior wants to buy a horse for his father. He heads to town and is captured by Stone, who learns of the Christmas reunion. Travis and Moses reunite and wait for Stone's next move. Junior escapes and follows the brothers. He camps out for the night. Junior wakes up and finds himself face- to-face with a western diamondback rattlesnake. He attempts to flee but gets bitten on the leg. He manages to ride to Travis and Moses' camp. The brothers take him to Bridget's and Melie's. Bridget injects Junior with a serum that neutralizes the venom. Travis reveals the reunion, angering Moses. Moses is about to fight with Travis, but Junior warns them about Stone's plan. Before leaving, Bridget and Travis share a kiss. The brothers finally arrive at Maw's and discover that she is holding Stone captive. Moses' family, Travis, Bridget and Melie all share a Christmas dinner as a family. However, the sheriff, deputy, Dodge and his gang plan to kill them but drop their guns when they are hypnotized by the night sky's beauty. A giant fist fight occurs between the two groups, involving the family winning. One of the daughters calls the event \\"The Fight Before Christmas.\\" The next morning, Maw reveals that the treasure is where their hearts are, much to Stone's dismay. Maw then leaves for Denver and all the people are taken a picture of by the photographer.

In the abstract, computer logic is generally \\"etched\\" or \\"hard-coded\\" onto a chip and cannot be changed after the chip has finished being manufactured. By utilizing a set of eFuses, a chip manufacturer can allow for the circuits on a chip to change while it is in operation. The primary application of this technology is to provide in-chip performance tuning. If certain sub-systems fail, or are taking too long to respond, or are consuming too much power, the chip can instantly change its behavior by \\"blowing\\" an eFUSE. Another use is to prevent downgrading the firmware of a device. The Xbox 360's bootloaders, for instance, will check the number of burnt fuses before attempting to install new firmware. The number of fuses expected to be burnt depends on the hardware model and the firmware to be installed. If too many fuses are burnt (meaning the firmware to be installed is older than the current firmware), then the bootloader will prevent installation of the older firmware. After successfully installing a new firmware version, the system will burn the required number of fuses to prevent downgrading.

His usual position was at full-back, although he could also play at centre or on the wing. Hinton joined Leeds on a two-year deal along with team-mate and Welsh international back-row Rhys Oakley at the start of the 2006–07 season from Newport Gwent Dragons making his début against London Welsh at Headingley on 3 September 2006. Leeds' then director of rugby Stuart Lancaster said at the time: \\"Leigh is a proven points-scorer in this division, both with his boot and as a try scorer. He has had a frustrating season last year and I know he is keen to put that behind him and make a fresh start with us. He can play at full-back or in the centres and with his experience he will be excellent for our younger players to work with.\\" Hinton was known as 'Points Machine' when he was with Orrell R.U.F.C. and Bedford Blues in National Division One scoring over 650 points in just two seasons before moving to Newport at the start of the 2005/07 season. The full-back has also played for Moseley Rugby Football Club and Birmingham & Solihull RFC in National Division One. In the 2003–04 season he set new records for tries and conversions in a season for Orrell, finishing with 313 points. In the following season he was leading points scorer in the division, finishing 60 points clear of Bristol’s Jason Strange and helping Bedford Blues to their Powergen Shield victory at Twickenham, scoring 9 of their 14 points in the Final. At Newport Gwent Dragons, after making his début against Glasgow Warriors he went on to make just a further seven appearances but it was a frustrating time for Hinton, and he registered just one try and two conversions in his spell in Wales. In his first season with the Tykes, Hinton finished the season as top points scorer in National Division One. Hinton was one of the stars of the failing Leeds Carnegie side that were relegated from the Premiership 2007/2008, and stayed loyal to Leeds when staying on at the club for a second stint in the first division. Hinton has just brought up 400 points for Leeds with a try against Plymouth Albion at Headingley Carnegie Stadium. Hinton joined National Division 3 Midlands side Rugby Lions in 2011, as one of many major signings by the club, to help with their ambitions of reaching the Premiership within 5 seasons under new owner Mike Aland. He reached the 200-point landmark in his 13th appearance of the 2011-12 season against Broadstreet, the team he also hit the 300-point mark against on 14 April. On 3 March 2012, in the home match against South Leicester, Hinton broke the Lions' record for points in a season. Rugby won the league with two games remaining on 31 March 2012, with Hinton kicking 3 penalties (and receiving a yellow card) in a 19-14 win over Dudley Kingswinford. At the end of season awards dinner, Hinton was awarded a special award for having scored the most points for the Lions in the season, finishing with 315. This consisted of 12 tries, 13 penalties and 108 conversions. In the summer of 2012, Hinton announced his retirement from Rugby.

The initiator of the project was attorney Yom-Tov Hamon, an expert in Ottoman law and land- ownership issues, who arbitrated disputes among Arab landowners in the region and opened sales of the land to Jews. The original building plan called for 24 houses surrounding a central square. The Jewish section of the neighborhood was built with private funding. Most of the original streets were named for Hebrew newspapers of the era: HaZvi, edited by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, Ariel, HaOr, Torah Mitzion, and Moriah. In 1931 a water reservoir was erected here. Extant architecture shows the area's original affluence, wealth, and diversity. These include the three-story residence of Arab Haj Muhammad, who owned quarries in nearby Lifta and was a judge in the city's Muslim courts; the elegant home of Jewish hotelier and businessman Yehiel Amdurski, and the home of Rabbi Yehuda Fishman-Maimon. By 1948, the population was diverse, with Arab, Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish residents. At the beginning of 1948, during the Civil war, Christian Palestinians and Muslim Arabs living in the Arab section of Romema as well as the nearby village of Lifta were forced out of their homes due to violence from Jewish paramilitary groups such as the Irgun, as well as clashes with Arab militia men. Due to the Absentee Property Law, Arab residents were not allowed to return to their homes by the Israeli government, a point of contention for Palestinians who held property there. Member of Harel Brigade 10th Battalion in Romema after snow fall, 1948. Romama from Schneller Orphanage, 1948 =State of Israel= After the establishment of the State of Israel, Romema became a center of light industry for many decades, home to a large number of garages, foundries, carpentry workshops and factories. From 1950 to 1991, Romema was the home of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, after access to the zoo on Mount Scopus was blocked in 1949. In 2007, as businesses closed and properties were bought up by developers, a master plan was commissioned for the neighborhood. Today Romema is Jerusalem's transportation hub: The Jerusalem Central Bus Station and Chords Bridge are located there, and a new high-speed railway terminus is being built opposite the bus station.Romema changes with the times Landmarks Monument to British soldiers, Allenby Square A 3-meter high monument commemorating the British soldiers who fell in the battle for Palestine stands at Allenby Square at the top of Romema Street, where the Turkish Army surrendered to General Allenby during World War I. It was erected by soldiers of the 60th London Division in 1920. The inscription around the base reads: \\"Near this spot, the Holy City was surrendered to the 60th London Division, 9th December 1917.\\" Etched into the monument are the silhouettes of Crusader knights, drawing a symbolic link between them and the British soldiers who conquered Jerusalem. The British also built a water tower in Romema, which was the highest point in Jerusalem at the time. Water from an adjacent pool was piped all over the city. The Jerusalem branch of the Magen David Adom ambulance service is located in Romema. Other landmarks include the Israel Television building, Jerusalem Gate Hotel, Center One shopping mall, Belz Great Synagogue and Rabbinical College with a design resembling that of the Second Temple, and the Aleh Center for the rehabilitation of handicapped children and youth. Former landmarks included offices of The Jerusalem Post and Haaretz, the Tnuva dairy factory, Amcor refrigerator factory, and Achuza wedding hall. These have been mostly demolished making room for construction of high-rise residential buildings. Architecture Many of the factory buildings in Romema were designed by Rudolf (\\"Rudy\\") Reuven Trostler, a pioneer of industrial architecture in Israel. Trostler also designed the five-story building housing the Israel Broadcasting Authority, which was erected in the 1960s as a diamond polishing center. The building was in the International Style with a gray breeze-block grille on the facade that became one of Trostler's stylistic trademarks. When the diamond industry in Jerusalem did not take off as anticipated, the building was renovated for television broadcasting.

They are one of the longest-running beat groups from Germany, spanning the last half century. They are best known for their work during the sixties and early seventies and are noted for their sometimes humorous and irreverent approach. Between 1965 and 1969, the Lords had twelve titles on the German charts, mainly produced by Heinz Gietz. Their biggest hit was the classic, \\"Gloryland\\", from September 1967, which reached number 5,. Their last success was \\"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\\" in August 1969. By 1989, The Lords had released over thirty singles and had achieved sales of seven million copies, a record for a German rock band in their own country.Edenhofer, Julia.

In 1964 when Beatlemania and the British Invasion swept across the world, they turned into \\"Germany's First Beat Music Act\\" and developed their classic style for which they are still known in Germany today. On 23 July 1964, the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night appeared in the German cinemas, titled Yeah Yeah Yeah. Before the premiere, a competition was held, with the \\"Berliner Beatles\\" being sought. From this competition the Lords emerged as the winner on 21 July 1964. Therefore, they were eligible to participate in the nationwide finals at the Hamburg Star Club. On 6 September 1964, the Lords won here too, and were named \\"Germany's Beat Band No. 1\\".Diergarten, Eckhard. 50 years The Lords: \\"long-haired, loud and a legend ...\\"--The Biography. Schalksmühle 2008, pg.36 - with forewords by Uschi Nerke and Manfred Sexauer In late 1964 the band received a recording contract from EMI in Cologne and were now marketed as the German Beatles.Diergarten, Eckhard. 50 years The Lords: \\"long-haired, loud and a legend ...\\"--The Biography. Schalksmühle 2008, pg. 15 In 1964 their bassist Knud Kuntze (\\"Lord Knud\\") (18 March 1944 - 14 June 2020) had to leave the band due to an accident in which he lost his leg. He then started a career in radio, becoming a prominent DJ at the radio station, RIAS. In 1965, the Lords' band's roster changed to what most fans consider to be their classic line-up. It would consist of Ulli Günther (vocals), Bernd Zamulo (bass), Leo Lietz (guitar), Rainer Petry (guitar) and Max Donath (drums). This roster lasted until 1971, which would mark the end of what was the most successful period of the band. In the period from 1965 until 1969 they had 11 hits in West German pop charts. Their first hit single from 1964 was Shakin' All Over (originally recorded by Johnny Kidd & The Pirates in 1960). Their other hits included the original song Poor Boy in 1965 (written by Leo Lietz), Poison Ivy in 1965 (originally by The Coasters, 1959), the Baptist traditional Gloryland in 1967, and Rockin' Pneumonia in 1967 (originally by Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith, 1957). Their 1960s cover versions of Shakin' all over, Poison Ivy, and Gloryland still get much more airtime on German radio today than the originals or later recordings of these songs by English and American performers. They also appeared as supporting act of The Kinks and The Who on German tours of the two English bands, and performed on the contemporary TV music programme Beat-Club several times (footage from these Beat-Club performances would continue to be rerun on German TV well into the 2000s, playing an important role in shaping public perception of The Lords as a classic beat era act). In 1967 their success allowed them to make an appearance as the main band in the Legia Stadium in Warsaw in front of 25,000 spectators; they were the first western band allowed to perform in a Soviet bloc country.Blazek, Matthias. 50 Years Ago, Started in the Beat by Celler Space (50 years Beatlemania in Celle). BPR project GbR, Celle 2013 , pg. 5 and 9 In 1971 the Lords broke up due to Bernd Zamulo forming Sitting Bull, but they would re-unite five years later. = Since 1976: Reunion = From 1976 onwards, The Lords have re-united on several occasions with different line-ups, mostly as a nostalgia live band playing their old hits at 60s festivals and on TV shows, every few years re-recording technologically updated versions of their songs. Especially \\"Lord Leo\\" Lietz has become sort of a bandleader since they have become mostly a 1960s nostalgia act, representing them and still giving the most interviews of all current band members. Singer of The Lords, Lord Ulli died in a Potsdam hospital on 13 October 1999, after having a breakdown while performing on stage on 9 October 1999 during a concert of their 40 years anniversary tour. Since 2000 The Lords have re-united again, in 2002 and 2009 they released two new albums. Knud Kuntze died on 14 June 2020, aged 76. \\"Berlins bekannteste Radio-Stimme ist verstummt\\", BZ-Berlin, 17 June 2020. Retrieved 18 June 2020  Style and reputation  Rather than taking the approach of a serious music band, The Lords were more of a slapstick and comedy troupe especially on stage, probably akin to bands like The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band in England at the time (and indeed Johnny Kidd & The Pirates whose Shakin' All Over The Lords covered and which became their first hit single), overdoing the contemporary moptop hairstyle by making it look like a stereotypical Medieval haircut as portrayed in the modern comic Prince Valiant, taking the formal suit fashion introduced by The Beatles and turning them into waiters' clothing, and dancing like a girl group such as the 1920s Tiller Girls on stage. This rather lighthearted attitude led to a rivalry with the more serious Hamburg-based band The Rattles and especially their bandleader and producer Achim Reichel, who was critical of the Lords for their silly antics. In addition to their clownesqueries, which were looked down upon by more ambitious proto-Krautrock artists such as Reichel, there was a rumour that singer of The Lords, Ulli Günther (\\"Lord Ulli\\") did not speak English even though it was the language he sang in, and that therefore his German accent was much thicker than was usual in the German-produced but English-sung music scene at the time. Towards the end of the 1960s, the band was increasingly influenced by psychedelia and brought more social commentary, serious or satirical, into their lyrics, effectually turning from a British Invasion- influenced pop band into a progressive Krautrock group. However, nothing of this development, nor the slapstick approach that came before it would be evident in subsequent reunions after 1976. Instead, since their re-formation they foster more of a rough rocker and teddy boy image both in their instrumentation, arrangements, and their clothing, now appearing in jeans clothing and sunglasses, comparable to the new style 1970s glam rock band Slade took on during the 1980s, even though today The Lords often perform to recordings of their old singles when on TV while dressed up in their new style. The original recordings of their singles, later often re-recorded by the band, were issued on CD as the double CD box The Original Singles – Collection/The A & B-Sides in 1999, beside which the CD version of their 1972 best-of album The LORDS 1964-1971 sold well, while Shakin' All Over '70 (1970) and The Very Best (1992), like most of their albums after 1971, are more recent, technologically updated re-recordings of their classic songs.

The movement sought to normalize use of the Catalan language in popular music and denounced the injustices in Francoist Spain. The Grup de Folk, which emerged in the same period, also promoted a new form of popular music in Catalan, drawing inspiration from contemporary American and British music. Historical context The Nova Cançó movement originated at the end of the 1950s, twenty years after the installation of the Spanish State with its repressive policies against the Catalan language and Catalan culture. The late 1950s were a period of economic and political change in Spain: Spain ended its policy of economic autarky, and Francoist Spain was admitted to the United Nations, which required the government to improve its image abroad. In this new context, at the beginning of the 1960s, new cultural projects emerged in Catalonia. In 1961, the record label Edigsa and the cultural organization Òmnium Cultural were founded, and the first edition of the children's magazine Cavall Fort was published. In April 1962, the publishing house Edicions 62 released its first book. Little by little, the Catalan language, the public use of which had been expressly forbidden after the fall of Catalonia in the Spanish Civil War, began to regain a public presence. A notable example is the magazine Germinàbit, published by the Abbey of Montserrat, which in October 1952 became the magazine Serra d’Or. In 1957, the writer Josep Maria Espinàs gave lectures on the French singer-songwriter Georges Brassens, whom he called \\"the troubadour of our times.\\" Espinàs had begun to translate some of Brassens' songs into Catalan. In 1958, two EPs of songs in Catalan were released: Hermanos Serrano: Cantan en catalán los éxitos internationals (\\"The Brothers Serrano Sing International Hits in Catalan\\") and José Guardiola: canta en catalán los éxitos internationales. They are now considered the first recordings of modern music in the Catalan language. These singers, as well as others such as Font Sellabona and Rudy Ventura, form a prelude to the Nova Cançó. La Nova Cançó The movement's beginnings were in the second half of the 1950s, with the formation of a group suggested by Josep Benet i de Joan and Maurici Serrahima. This consisted of Jaume Armengol, Lluís Serrahima and Miquel Porter, who started composing Catalan songs. In 1959, after an article by Lluís Serrahima, titled \\"Ens calen cançons d’ara\\" (\\"We need songs for today\\"), was published in Germinabit, more authors and singers were attracted to the movement. Miquel Porter, Josep Maria Espinàs and Remei Margarit founded the group Els Setze Jutges (The Sixteen Judges, in Catalan). Their first concert, although still not with this name, was on 19 December 1961, in Barcelona. Their first performance with the name of Els Setze Jutges was in Premià de Mar in 1962. In the following years, new singers joined the group, until the number of sixteen (Setze). The group offered numerous performances all over Catalonia with a willingness of filling a lack in popular music in Catalan, often in precarious conditions, in which they followed the same system: everyone of the four or five members in the stage sung in turns, with his guitar, while the others were seated in the background on the stage. The first Nova Cançó records appeared in 1962, and many musical bands, vocal groups, singer-songwriters, and interpreters picked up the trend. In 1963, a professional Catalan artist, Salomé, and a Valencian, Raimon, were awarded the first prize of the Fifth Mediterranean Song Festival with the song \\"Se’n va anar\\" (\\"[She] left\\"). Despite the restrictions and administrative hurdles in television and radio broadcast, as well as in record industry, the Nova Cançó became increasingly popular, so many interpreters started to professionalize: first members of Els Setze Jutges sang as an amateur activity, and they leave when younger members started a career as a singers, such as Joan Manuel Serrat, Lluís Llach, Maria del Mar Bonet, Guillermina Motta or Francesc Pi de la Serra. At the same time, other variations on the style, based on other genres such as folk, appeared, with bands such as Grup de Folk and Esquirols. Other important participants in the movement included Guillem d'Efak and Núria Feliu, who received the Spanish Critics' Award in 1966, or other new members of Els Setze Jutges. Some of them were even well known abroad. As time passed, some bilingual singers appeared and other ideological positions emerged, diverging from the initial ideas behind the movement. Apart from Raimon, other former members of Els Setze Jutges continued their careers successfully, including Lluís Llach, Maria del Mar Bonet, Guillermina Motta, Francesc Pi de la Serra, and Joan Manuel Serrat. Other significant figures appeared somewhat later, like the Valencian Ovidi Montllor. Inspired by the success of the Nova Cançó, parallel movements sprang up in Galicia, Basque Country (Euskal Kantagintza Berria), and Castile.

In the programme, she played local matriarch Grace Lachlan, one of several \\"strong women characters (who) provided a focus\\". Series creator Don Houghton praised Thomson and her co-star Eileen McCallum for their clarity as speakers of the Scots dialect, an essential attribute of their respective roles in the programme.Houghton (preface), p. 6. Thomson was associated with the Glasgow Unity Theatre group from its foundation in 1941, playing a wide range of roles.Elder, pp. 70–71. As a member of the group, she played Jean Mutrie as female lead in The Gorbals Story, a successful play by Robert McLeish which opened in 1946 at the Queen's Theatre, Gallowgate and then toured the UK, including a residence at London's Garrick Theatre in 1948. Thomson reprised the role in the film version (1950). This was her screen debut and the cast included Russell Hunter, who became her first husband. She specialised in the stage through the 1950s until her TV debut on 1 January 1960. She told Michael Elder that her personal highlight in those years was appearing in Scotland's first Royal Variety Performance on 3 July 1958 at Glasgow's Alhambra Theatre, attended by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh. Her TV debut was a guest role in Para Handy - Master Mariner. She stayed with the medium in addition to stage and some radio work. Over the next twenty years until Take the High Road began, she ran up a long list of TV credits. Among these were several guest parts in the original (1960s) series of Dr. Finlay's Casebook. She was a cast regular as Mrs Gauld in High Living which ran for three years from 1968 to 1971 and was billed as Scottish Television's first soap opera. In the 1970s, she continued to work in TV, on the stage and on the radio, building a reputation as one of Scotland's most respected character actresses. She appeared in three episodes of the TV series Sutherland's Law and also had a regular part in the radio version of The McFlannels. Thomson appeared in the first-ever episode of Take the High Road, aired on 19 February 1980, as Grace Lachlan. She stayed with the programme as one of the main cast until 1995, appearing in several hundred episodes. Grace was the widow of a sheep-herding crofter called Donald Lachlan and kept house for her son Dougal (played by Alec Monteath), who had succeeded his father as crofter at Ardvain on the Glendarroch estate. She left the programme in 1993 but returned for guest appearances until 1995. She was known outside acting as Marjorie Hunter and died aged 98 in Perthshire on 10 March 2012, survived by her daughters Lesley and Anne.

Today the town have electricity, telephone. There is a dam (barrage) providing water for livestock, feeding off the ephemeral tributary that forms part of the Lac du Bam catchment of the Volta. The IMF paid for improvements under the national Projet Boulis et Petite Irrigation Villageoise program. Most residents farm or have livestock. The traditional farming lands surround the settlement, with land allocation largely controlled by the powerful village chief. There is a traditional cycle of seasonal festivals. There have been occasional development efforts, such as the activities of the soil and water project PATECORE, and Saudi Arabia has funded many well-digging projects in the region. Tourists are almost nonexistent, and there are no attractions or visitor accommodation. There is basic schooling, but for the lycée (high school) pupils must relocate to Kongoussi. Rollo residents are found working much further afield - France, Ivory Coast, etc. and they return remittances to families or extended kin.

Located on Jeddah Corniche, Tower 1 will be tall (including antenna) with 72 floors above ground, and Tower 2 will be tall with 62 floors above ground. The proposal for the project was submitted by Cayan in 2008 and was approved in the same year. Construction began in 2008 and, when completed in 2016, Tower 1 will be the tallest building in Jeddah, till date, surpassing the recently completed National Commercial Bank. The development is expected to cost about $600 million. The tower was designed by Saudi Diyar Consultants. The Construction Management Service is by MIDRAR. The Lamar company is the main developer of the project and Drake & Scull Construction are the main contractors for this landmark development. The holding company has declared bankruptcy and construction on the building has stopped. There are many civil suits against the company for property sold in these buildings. Lamar is Arabic for liquid gold, which describes the reflection of the golden glass in the waters of the Red Sea. Description The Lamar Towers will include the following: * Underground parking for over 500 cars. * Retail center - The Lamar Mall. * Offices - Over 10 floors of office space. * The Lamar Spa - this membership only spa will provide separate facilities for men and women. * Residential - 1, 2, 3, or 4 bedroom apartments and Penthouse/Royal Floors. Owners Drake & Scull International is carrying out the MEP works, with KASKTAS Arabia responsible for the piling, shoring, grouting, soil improvement and dewatering works. The architectural and engineering concept and schematic design for Lamar Towers was undertaken by RMJM Dubai. The main contract was awarded originally to Arabian Construction Company in October 2008, but it was reportedly subsequently reawarded to Arabtec in May 2009 by developer Cayan Investment & Development, according to Arab News. The structure part of the project was then awarded on 12 October 2010 to the Saudi Lebanese Tarouk Contracting company Ltd who constructed a substantial part of the Project and two towers (up to levels 26, both towers) before being terminated by the Owner on 31 December 2012. The remaining part of the structure and the Project were transferred then in July 2013 to the UAE based general contractor Drake & Scull Construction, part of the Drake & Scull International PJSC group.

Järntorgsgatan is a street in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching south from the square Järntorget to Slussplan, it is intercepted by Norra Dryckesgränd and Södra Dryckesgränd and forms a parallel street to Triewaldsgränd and Skeppsbron. History Until the 14th century the waterfront passed right through the present square, and subsequently the present street didn't exist. Since then, land elevation and land filling have expanded the radius of the old town with some hundred metres. While the present name of the square is documented from 1489 when the open space was used to store and handle iron delivered from the Lake Mälaren region, the name of the street first appears in historical records in 1685 as Jerntorgs gatun. The street used to be the main approach to the city from Södermalm, and it was accordingly called Stora gatan (\\"Big Street\\"). A now closed alley, the location and extent of which is documented in great detail, used to pass in parallel to the street through the blocks on its eastern side. (See ref, page 19.)

Its church, St Mary the Virgin, lies about a mile north of the present-day village. It is one of 38 existing round-tower churches in Suffolk and the one with the greatest diameter in England. History In the time of Edward the Confessor Wortham consisted of two parishes, each with its own church and parsonage. They had of glebe between them and a combined value of seven shillings. After the Norman Conquest there were still two parishes, corresponding to the two Norman manors: Southmoor, held by the Abbots of Bury, and Eastgate (Wortham Hall) held by the Barons of Rye. In 1769 the parishes were combined under William Evans, Rector of Eastgate. The Saxon church in Southmoor disappeared and was never rebuilt, although the Rectory remained until 1785. A faculty was granted by the Bishop of Norwich to Rowland Holt (Patron) and Henry Patterson (Rector) for \\"taking down and excusing the rebuilding of one of the parsonages belonging to the Rectory of Wortham Edward w. Jervis annexed.\\" This parsonage was stated to be above a mile from the church and built of stud and clay work and covered with a thatch. Wortham was the family seat of the Betts familyK. F. Doughty in The Betts of Wortham in Suffolk – 1480-1905. The village was home to the author Richard Cobbold between 1825 and 1877. In addition to a famous story of Margaret Catchpole, he published in 1860 The Biography Of A Victorian Village - Wortham, which contains a series of drawings and character details of various members of the community during the mid-Victorian period. This is a useful source for genealogists. The novelist and agricultural writer Doreen Wallace moved to Wortham in 1922 for her married life. The local public house is The Manor House.

The term originated with the Ottoman Navy, but eventually spread to encompass most irregular troops. The origin of the term is probably from Italian levanti, and was used by the Venetians for the various local troops they raised in the coasts of the Balkans, i.e. Christian Greeks, Albanians, and Dalmatians, to serve in the Venetian navy or as auxiliary troops. The Ottomans, who relied on the same manpower pool (eventually along with Muslim Anatolian Turks), borrowed the name. Gradually, as the Ottoman navy became more professional, the undisciplined levends started to be replaced by regular troops. The name however survived as a generic name for naval troops, particularly the riflemen (tüfekdji). Thus the Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople contained two barracks for levends. Thus in the 17th and 18th centuries, levend came to refer to irregular mercenaries, mostly infantry but also cavalry, used alongside other terms. Like the mercenaries and condottieri of Western Europe, the levend formed true \\"free companies\\"; their employer was either the Ottoman central government, which was increasingly pressed for fresh troops to match the growing strength of its various neighbours, and to offset the decline of its once-formidable kapikulu soldiery, or various provincial magnates and governors. A notable aspect of Ottoman mercenaries is that they served away from their home region; thus Albanians served in the Middle East, and Anatolian Turks in Europe or North Africa. When without employment, however, the levends often turned to brigandage, and the term quickly came to denote any \\"vagabond and rascal\\". At the turn of the 18th century, the Ottoman authorities tried to counter the activities of roving levend bands by offering them employment in the new military corps of deli and gönüllü. Later, repeated expeditions were waged against them in Anatolia in 1737, 1747, 1752, 1759, and 1763. Even when they formed part of a governor's retinue, however, they had a reputation for criminal behaviour and licentiousness, as records from the Ottoman provinces and the tales of Western travellers show.

Although the performance is credited to \\"Big Time Jazzers\\" the tune is actually played by Hall's band as well. Fred Hall (actual name Fred Arthur Ahl, 1898–1954) was an American pianist, bandleader and composer. Hall was born in New York City and began his musical career working as a song- plugger for various music publishers. As a bandleader Hall and his men recorded prolifically for many labels (see below) from 1925 onwards. Many recordings featured vocalist Arthur Fields with whom Hall enjoyed a lengthy partnership, co-writing scores of songs, the better known ones including Eleven More Months And Ten More Days and I Got A Code In My Dose. Hall and Fields also appeared together on the NBC radio show The Sunday Driver. Notable musicians in Hall's band included trumpeters Mike Mosiello and Leo McConville. Apart from playing piano, conducting and composing Hall sometimes performed scat singing on his records. A selection of Hall's recorded work has been reissued on CD by The Old Masters label. Hall made his last recordings in 1932, after which little is known of him. It is recorded that he joined ASCAP in 1939. He died in New York on October 6, 1954 at the age of 56.

Biography Born in Lucknow, India to Rev. Joseph and Sarah Jane (Lauck) Parson, Alfred received his BS in chemistry from Oxford University. Between 1913 and 1915 he was a visiting graduate student at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley, where coincidentally Gilbert N. Lewis was working as the chair of the department of chemistry. During these years, Lewis read a paper by Parson, which argued that the electron, in the Bohr model, might be a ring of negative electricity spinning with a high velocity about its axis and that a chemical bond results from two electrons being shared between two atoms. Parson published the final draft of his theory in 1915. Stimulated by this paper, Lewis published his famous 1916 article \\"The Atom and the Molecule\\", in which a chemical bond forms owing to the sharing of pairs of electrons.Gilbert N. Lewis, The Atom and the Molecule (1916). Several other physicists of the time, including Arthur H. Compton, Clinton Davisson, Lars O. Grondahl, David L. Webster,David L. Webster \\"The Theory of Electromagnetic Mass of the Parson Magneton and other Non-Spherical Systems,\\" Physical Review, V9, pp. 484-499. and H. Stanley Allen, developed Parson's ideas further using a toroidal ring model for the atom. Parson himself returned to England, where he served in World War I. Suffering from severe shell shock, he did not pursue an academic career, but years later published papers and books on astronomy and related topics. He died 1970 in Allonby, England. Scientific contributions The Parson magneton, also known as the \\"magnetic electron,\\" was a hypothetical object in atomic physics suggested by Parson in 1915: an electron ring that generates a magnetic field. Parson's model of the atom inspired several other toroidal ring models.

Lowry Egerton Cole, 4th Earl of Enniskillen, (21 December 1845 – 28 April 1924), styled Viscount Cole from 1850 to 1886, was an Irish peer and Conservative Member of Parliament. Background Cole was the second – but eldest surviving – son of William Willoughby Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen and his wife, Jane Casamaijor. Educated at Eton College. Political career As Lord Cole, he was appointed High Sheriff of Fermanagh for 1870 and then elected to the House of Commons for Enniskillen in 1880, a seat he held until 1885 when the constituency was abolished. The following year he succeeded his father as fourth Earl of Enniskillen and entered the House of Lords. Lord Enniskillen was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick (KP) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was invested by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Earl Cadogan, at Dublin Castle on 11 August 1902. Personal life Spy, published in Vanity Fair in 1876. Lord Enniskillen married Charlotte Marion Baird, daughter of wealthy Scottish businessman Douglas Baird and his wife Charlotte Acton, in 1869. The following year he was cited as one of two co-respondents in the case for divorce brought by Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th Bt., a former M.P., against his wife, Harriet, in which Prince Albert Edward, The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), was called to give evidence. The divorce was denied as Lady Mordaunt was judged to be insane, but was finally granted in 1875 when Cole did not contest the claim that he was the father of Lady Mordaunt's daughter, Violet (1869–1928), later Marchioness of Bath. Lord Enniskillen died in April 1924, aged 78, and was succeeded in his titles by his second — but eldest surviving — son John. Lady Enniskillen died in 1937.

The name is thought to come from the Old English word \\"cnæp\\", referring to the mound on which it stands. History The castle was originally a motte and bailey fortress, built in the 12th century by William de Braose. It was rebuilt as a stone castle with a two- storey keep in 1214 by King John. In addition to John the castle had a succession of royal visitors, including Henry III in 1218, Edward II in 1324 and Richard II in 1384. Subsequently, it fell into decline and deteriorated. The bulk of it had been destroyed by the 1720s. In the early 19th century the remnants were reinforced and fenced in by Sir Charles Burrell to protect them from further deterioration. The 19th century mansion also known as Knepp Castle. The castle stands on an oval mound, modelled from a natural feature, surrounded by a ditch and ramparts. The ditch, fed from a nearby pond, formed a moat which still contained water at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The surviving remains of the castle consist of a single wall 11 metres high, 9.5 metres long, and 2.5 metres thick, with a doorway and another opening above it. This wall apparently formed the north end of the west wall of a tower or keep. The name Knepp Castle is also applied to the castellated Gothic Revival mansion built nearby in the early nineteenth century by Sir Charles Merrik Burrell, to the designs of John Nash. Rewilding Grazing near Knepp Castle Since 2001 the Knepp estate has been part of a pioneering rewilding project known as Knepp Wildland . It comprises of former arable and dairy farmland. Significantly it is the first lowland rewilding project of significant scale in England. The project uses herds of free-roaming animals including Old English longhorn cattle, Exmoor ponies, Tamworth pigs, red deer and fallow deer to drive habitat generation and focuses on restoring dynamic natural processes. The project has seen a spontaneous revival of many rare species. It is now a breeding hotspot for purple emperor butterflies, turtle doves and nightingales. A reintroduction programme of white storks to England is in its early stages on the estate, with juvenile birds being kept in a six and a half acre pen until maturity, when they will be released. Sussex was chosen for its strong historical associations with the stork. The programme aims to establish a breeding population in Britain for the first time since 1416.

The Tripura Era's New Year is on the 1st of Vaishakh which corresponds to 14 or 15 of April of Christian Era, depending on whether that year is a Leap year or not. The months are named in pan Indian months, time since its inception 1419 years back by Tripur king Hamtorfa alias Himtifa alias Jujharufa in 512 Saka Era. Historically, the Tripura Era was prevalent in all official matters of the princely state of Tippera under the British Raj. Tradition holds that the era marks the conquest of Bengal by the 118th Tripuri king in the Rajmala chronicle, Hamtor Fa (also Jujaru Fa or Himti or Birraj). In historical reality, however, the Tripuri era, just as the Bengali era, is an adoption of the Mughal Fasli era introduced by emperor Akbar in 1563. Its use in Tripura (Twipra) can be traced to the 163th king in Tripuri reckoning, Govinda Manikya (fl. 1660), and the characteristic shift by three years is first recorded under his successor, Chhatramanikya in 1663/4, who can thus be considered to have introduced the \\"Tripuri calendar\\". With the accession of Tripura to the Republic of India in 1949, official use of the Tripuri calendar was discontinued. There have long been calls to revive the Tripuri calendar in Tripuri nationalism. In 1991, the Tripuri era was first cited in the State Government calendar and diaries. In 2001, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) authorities organized a three-day \\"Tring festival\\", which concluded at the TTAADC headquarters Khumulwng in West Tripura.

Marlborough broke through the French defensive lines and took Bouchain after a siege of 34 days. Its capture left Cambrai the only French- held fortress between the allied army and Paris. Prelude Throughout the early summer of 1711 Marlborough's army, having taken the important fortress of Douai the previous year, manoeuvred indecisively in northern France, blocked by the French Lines of Ne Plus Ultra – a massive series of fieldworks stretching from the Channel coast to the Ardennes at Namur. The allied army had been weakened by the withdrawal of Prince Eugene's army to cover the upper Rhine, as the deposed Elector of Bavaria attempted to take advantage of the disruption caused by the death of the Emperor Joseph. On 6 July, Marlborough captured the small fortress of Arleux, just to the north of the Lines, west of Bouchain, both to deny its use to the French as a sally-port, and to secure the water supply to Douai, which could be cut off by damming the canal that supplied the town. The Duke was then wrong-footed by Villars as the French army crossed the Lines on 22/23 July and retook Arleux, with the allied army too far to the west to intervene in time, and the defences were levelled before the French retreated back across the Lines. Marlborough, initially furious, soon retook the initiative by marching his army as if to assault the Lines near Arras, and carrying out a detailed personal reconnaissance there on 4 August in full view of Villars' covering army. That night the army struck camp, leaving their campfires burning to deceive the French, and marched eastwards to Arleux. At midnight a force from Douai under Cadogan crossed the unguarded French lines, and by 8 am the advance guard of the main army was also crossing over. Villars, arriving on the scene with a few hundred cavalry, realised he had been outmanoeuvred, and though he attempted to offer battle in front of Bourlon Wood, Marlborough declined to attack, the Marshal's position being even stronger than the one in which he had given Marlborough's army such a mauling two years earlier at Malplaquet. He thus drew off and attempted to hinder Marlborough's siege of Bouchain which followed. The siege To defend the town Bouchain's governor, de Ravignau, had some 5,000 men against Marlborough's besieging army of 30,000, and the advantage of one of the strongest fortresses left to France, surrounded by the marshy land of the confluence of the rivers Scheldt and Sensée. In addition, Villars' strong army had taken up position to the west of the allied camp, and had managed to open a tenuous link to the besieged garrison. Marlborough responded by using earthwork gun batteries to counter Villars, used a crack assault force managed by 18 August to once more cut the Marshal's communication with Bouchain, and established a fieldwork-protected corridor from the siege camp to his main supply port at Marchiennes on the Scarpe. Frequent raids by Villars on both the supply convoys on the Scarpe, and towards Douai, failed to interrupt the siege, and the garrison marched out to become prisoners of war on 13 September 1711. Aftermath Bouchain was Marlborough's last campaign. On the last day of the year he was stripped of his position as Captain-General, and of all his other offices. Command of the army on the continent for the campaign of 1712 was given to the Duke of Ormonde, and strict limitations were placed on his freedom of movement. Particularly he was prohibited from engaging the French in battle, as Anglo-French peace talks were well advanced, and the opportunity of seizing Cambrai and marching on Paris, opened by Marlborough's gains the year before, was abandoned. Before the year was out, the British army would withdraw from the alliance, leaving the remaining allies, under Eugene of Savoy to be defeated at Denain. The following year, Bouchain was recaptured on 19 October 1712 by French forces under Marshal Villars, after an 18 day siege.

Although depth can be defined more generally, the most common case considered is the case of modules over a commutative Noetherian local ring. In this case, the depth of a module is related with its projective dimension by the Auslander–Buchsbaum formula. A more elementary property of depth is the inequality : \\\\mathrm{depth}(M) \\\\leq \\\\dim(M), where dim M denotes the Krull dimension of the module M. Depth is used to define classes of rings and modules with good properties, for example, Cohen-Macaulay rings and modules, for which equality holds.  Definition  Let R be a commutative ring, I an ideal of R and M a finite R-module with the property that IM is properly contained in M. Then the I-depth of M, also commonly called the grade of M, is defined as : \\\\mathrm{depth}_I(M) = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{i: \\\\operatorname{Ext}^i(R/I,M) e 0\\\\\\\\}. By definition, the depth of a local ring R with a maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} is its \\\\mathfrak{m}-depth as a module over itself. If R is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, then depth of R is equal to the dimension of R. By a theorem of David Rees, the depth can also be characterized using the notion of a regular sequence. = Theorem (Rees) = Suppose that R is a commutative Noetherian local ring with the maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} and M is a finitely generated R-module. Then all maximal regular sequences x1,..., xn for M, where each xi belongs to \\\\mathfrak{m}, have the same length n equal to the \\\\mathfrak{m}-depth of M.  Depth and projective dimension  The projective dimension and the depth of a module over a commutative Noetherian local ring are complementary to each other. This is the content of the Auslander–Buchsbaum formula, which is not only of fundamental theoretical importance, but also provides an effective way to compute the depth of a module. Suppose that R is a commutative Noetherian local ring with the maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} and M is a finitely generated R-module. If the projective dimension of M is finite, then the Auslander–Buchsbaum formula states : \\\\mathrm{pd}_R(M) + \\\\mathrm{depth}(M) = \\\\mathrm{depth}(R).  Depth zero rings  A commutative Noetherian local ring R has depth zero if and only if its maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} is an associated prime, or, equivalently, when there is a nonzero element x of R such that x\\\\mathfrak{m}=0 (that is, x annihilates \\\\mathfrak{m}). This means, essentially, that the closed point is an embedded component. For example, the ring k[x,y]/(x^2,xy) (where k is a field), which represents a line (x=0) with an embedded double point at the origin, has depth zero at the origin, but dimension one: this gives an example of a ring which is not Cohen–Macaulay.

You dig anywhere on this planet, one can find Indian god's idols show that the \\"Sanatana Dharma\\" was everywhere few thousands years back. Ganesha was a deity particularly worshipped by traders and merchants, who went out of India for commercial ventures.Nagar, p. 174.

The Jaina canonical literature does not mention Ganesha.Krishan, p. 121. The earliest literary reference to Ganesha in Jainism is in Abhidhānacitāmani of Hemachandra (c.a. third quarter of twelfth century). It refers to several appellations of Ganesha such as Heramba, and Vinayaka and visualizes him as elephant headed, pot-bellied, bearing an axe and riding a mouse.Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God By Robert L. Brown p.101-102 According to the Swetambara Jaina work, Ācāradinakara of Vardhamānasūri (c. AD 1412), Ganapati is propitiated even by the gods to get desirable things. It is further mentioned that He is worshipped at the beginning of every auspicious ceremony and new project. This practice is still very common in the Swetambara community. The text provides procedures for the installation of Ganapati images. The popularity is however not met with in Digambara texts. Excepting two medieval figures carved at Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, Orissa and an early figure at Mathura, his representations are not found in any Digambara sites. The earliest known Jaina Ganesha statue at Mathura with Jaina YakshiAmbika(the Jaina name for Gauri).[9] dates to about the 9th century AD.[10] Images of Ganesha appear in the Jaina temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.[11] In the tenth-century Mahavir at Ghanerav and eleventh-century temple in Osian, Rajasthan; Ganesha images are found.

Scholars commonly date the presence of Ganesha in Japan with the age of Kukai (774- 834), the founder of the Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism. The centrality of the worship of Ganesha or Vinayaka or Kangiten, as he is popularly called in Japan, is a distinguishing feature of this cult. The doctrines, rituals and beliefs of the sect have a number of parallels with the tradition of Ganapatya. Also called the Deva of bliss, Kangiten is invoked both for enlightenment and for worldly gains - more for the latter than the former. Kangiten is usually offered sweet confections called “Kangidan” (歓喜団, “bliss-buns”) which are made from curds, honey, and red bean paste. They are wrapped in kneaded dough made from parched flour and shaped like a bun before they are deep fried. Kangidan is a variant of the modak, said to be a favorite of Ganesha. Daikon, sake, and fresh fruits are also common offerings. The offerings are later partaken in the same spirit as Hindus take prasad. Ganesha is worshipped as god of love by many young boys and girls for achieving success in their courtship. The old worship him for success in business.'Goddess Benzaiten - Saraswati rules Japan kitchens', Hindustan Times, Mumbai February 28, 2007 pg.12\\"Japan wants to encourage studies of Hindu gods\\" Satyen Mohapatra  Kangi figures  Ganesha in a Japanese temple. There are more than thirty distinguishable forms of Ganesha in the Japanese iconographic tradition.Sanford, James H. \\"Literary Aspects of Japan's Dual-Gaņeśa Cult.\\" pp. 287-335 in: Brown, Robert L. (editor), Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God, op. cit. For the statement regarding the number of forms and popularity of this figure see pp. 288-89. There are several dual forms. The most typical dual form is the Embracing Kangi. In this form two tall figures with elephant heads and human bodies, male and female, stand in embrace. A new concept of Vinayaka couple both elephant-headed – a unique development in the religious history of Japan. The concept of this twin form of Ganesha (with Ganeshani) could not develop in India. There are at least three variant types of Embracing Kangi figures. Orthodox Shingon Buddhism interprets the details of all three types as sophisticated allegorical symbols. Sanford believes that these orthodox Shingon interpretations, of considerable eventual importance in Japanese worship of Ganesha, developed during the Heian period in an attempt to legitimize Ganesha as a figure in Japanese Buddhism.Sanford, op. cit., p. 290 = Buddha In Hinduism =  Buddha as avatar of Ganesha  Buddha appears as a name of Ganesha in the second verse of the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama.. (, 1991). Includes the full source text and the commentary by Bhāskararāya in Sanskrit. The name \\"\\" is in verse 7 of the volume cited, which corresponds to verse 2 of the śasahasranāma proper. The positioning of this name at the beginning of the Ganesha Sahasranama indicates that the name was of importance to the authors of that scripture, who were Ganapatya Hindus. Bhaskararaya's commentary on the Ganesha Sahasranama says that this name for Ganesha means that the Buddha was an incarnation (Avatar) of Ganesha.Bhaskararaya's commentary on the name Buddha with commentary verse number is: नित्यबुद्धस्वरूपत्वात् अविद्यावृत्तिनाशनः । यद्वा जिनावतारत्वाद् बुद्ध इत्यभिधीयते ॥ १५ ॥ This interpretation is not widely known even among Ganapatya, and the Buddha is not mentioned in the lists of Ganesha's incarnations given in the main sections of the Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana. Bhaskararaya also provides a more general interpretation of this name as simply meaning that Ganesha's very form is \\"eternal enlightenment\\" (), so he is named Buddha.

He is associated with arts, education and trade. Ganesha appears in the emblem of the Department of Fine Arts in Thailand. Large television channels and production companies have shrines in his honour in front of their premises. Few movies or television shows begin shooting without a Hindu ritual in which prayers and offerings are made to Ganesha. There are shrines to Ganesha across Thailand. One of the most revered shrines is the Royal Brahmin Temple in central Bangkok by the Giant Swing, where some of the oldest images can be found. Other old Ganesha images can be seen throughout Thailand, including a 10th-century bronze image found at Phang-Na with both Tamil and Thai inscriptions. The Hindu temple Wat Phra Sri Umadevi in Silom also houses a Ganesha image which was transported from India in the late 19th century. Thai Buddhists frequently pay respect to Ganesha and other Hindu deities as a result of the overlapping Buddhist/Hindu cosmology. He is honoured with Motaka, sweets and fruit, when business is good, and he is made ridiculous by putting his picture or statue upside down, when business is down. As lord of business and diplomacy, he sits on a high pedestal outside Bangkok's CentralWorld (formerly World Trade Center), where people offer flowers, incense and a reverential sawasdee. Chachoengsao is known as the \\"city of Ganesha in Thailand\\", with 3 huge Hindu-Buddhist deity Ganesha (Phra Phikanet or พระพิฆเนศ in thai language) statues in 3 different temples around Chachoengsao: 49 meters tall sitting Ganesha at \\"Phrong Akat Temple\\" which is the tallest sitting Ganesha in Thailand, 39 meters high standing Ganesha at \\"Khlong Khuean Ganesh International Park\\" which is the tallest standing Ganesha in Thailand, and 16 meters high and 22 meters long reclining Ganesha at \\"Saman Wattanaram Temple\\".Travel Chachoengsao, thailandlocaltravel.com. = In Indonesia = With regards to Indonesia, European scholars call him the 'Indonesian God of Wisdom'. Bandung boasts a Ganesha Street. A Ganesha statue from the 1st century AD was found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan Island, the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java. While there are not temples dedicated specifically to , he is found in every Śiva shrine throughout the islands.Loving : Hinduism's Endearing Elephant - Faced God By Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Subramuniya, P. 287 An 11th-century AD Ganesha statue (seen in the picture below) was found in eastern Java, Kediri is placed in The Museum of Indian Art (Museum für Indische Kunst), Berlin-Dahlem. The 9th century statue of Ganesha resides in western cella (room) of Prambanan Hindu temple. Ganesha in Ta Prohm, Angkor Ganesha is also featured in reliefs from Cambodian temples. Speculation related to Janus In 1785, William Jones drew a close comparison between a particular form of Ganesha, known as Dwimukhi-Ganesha, and Janus, the two- headed Roman god.\\"On the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India\\" in: Asiatick Researches; or, the Transactions of the Society instituted in Bengal, vol. i.; London, 1806. This reference is also cited as: Asiatic Researches, vol. i; J.A.S. of B., 1806, p. 226. Jones felt the resemblance between Dwimukhi- Ganesha and Janus was so strong that he referred to Ganesha as the \\"Janus of India.\\"Getty, op. cit., p. 14. Getty provides a picture of the dwimukhi- Ganesha form, which is a very unusual depiction. The Dwimukhi-Ganesha form is a very unusual depiction in which Ganesha is shown with the head of an elephant looking toward his right and a human head at his left. It was possessed of four arms. Nagar says that the Dwimukhi-Ganesha form was associated with the region around Bombay.Nagar, p. 78. This speculation was repeated by Volney in his Meditation on the Revolutions of Empires (1791), in which he noted the phonetic similarity between the names \\"Ganesha\\" and \\"Janus\\" and both gods' association with beginnings;Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney. Les ruines, ou, Méditation sur les révolutions des empires. Paris, 1826. Chapter XXII, footnote 68. and by Moor in The Hindu Pantheon (1810).Edward Moor. The Hindu Pantheon. p. 98. (Reprint edition: Delhi, 1968) Moor expanded the claims of an association based on functional grounds, noting that Janus, like Ganesha, was invoked at the beginning of undertakings, a liminal god who was the guardian of gates. Moor made various other speculations on the connection between Janus and Ganesha.The summary of Moor's case is taken from Nagar, op. cit., p. 99, note 3. These fanciful connections proposed by early Indologists no longer appear in modern academic reviews of Ganesha's history.Janus is not listed in the indexes for Brown (1991), Courtright (1985), or Thapan (1997), three of the most-often cited current academic reviews on Ganesha. Ganesha is represented as having anywhere from one to five heads, so depictions with two heads are not reliable evidence of a connection with Janus.For a review of Ganesha iconography that includes categorization of forms by the number of heads, see: Nagar, op. cit., Chapter VIII, \\"Iconography\\". Representations of Ganesha with two heads are uncommon, and according to Nagar, textual references to the adoration of Ganesha with two heads are difficult to trace. There are no other examples of two-headed forms in which one head is human other than the Dwimukhi-Ganesha form. In the thirty-two mediation forms of Ganesha that are described in the Sritattvanidhi only one has two heads (Dwimukhi Ganapati, the Ganapati with two faces), and both of those are heads of elephants, like all the other forms described.

It is assigned to the Tenth Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, stationed at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. The 310th SW is mission partnered with the United States Space Force's 21st Space Wing, 30th Space Wing, and 460th Space Wing. Overview The 310 SW is the only space wing in the Air Force Reserve. It provides specialized expertise, continuity and combat ready personnel, projecting space power for U.S. interests worldwide. The 310th has a long and rich heritage dating back to World War II, when it began as the 310th Bombardment Group on 15 March 1942, flying North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. In October 1942, the 310th was the first 12th Air Force group sent overseas, initially to England and then to French Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, France, and Italy where the highly decorated unit participated in the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign.Story of the 12th Air Force The 310th Bombardment Group was inactivated in September 1945. The 310th Bombardment Wing was reactivated in 1952 as part of Strategic Air Command. It trained on the Boeing B-29 Superfortress before converting to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet. It was inactivated in June 1965 with the phaseout of the B-47 from the U.S. Air Force inventory. The 310th became part of Air Force Space Command in 1991 when the 310th Training and Test Wing was activated for a short time at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.; the 310th designator was again activated with the stand up of the 310th Space Group on 4 September 1997. The 310th Space Group was re-designated the 310th Space Wing on 7 March 2008. The 310th Space Wing is commanded by Colonel Traci L. Kueker-Murphy. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Imelda B. Johnson. Subordinate units The wing is composed of the 310th Operations Group, 710th Operations Group, and 310th Mission Support Group, that support various military and other government organizations including, but not limited to, the Department of Commerce, United States Space Force, Space Operations Command, 50th Space Wing, 21st Space Wing, and 460th Space Wing. * 310th Operations Group ** 6th Space Operations Squadron (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program backup for NOAA) ** 7th Space Operations Squadron (associate unit to 1st Space Operations Squadron) ** 9th Combat Operations Squadron (supports the Fourteenth Air Force Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base) ** 19th Space Operations Squadron (associate unit to 2 SOPS) ** 310th Operations Support Squadron (provides operations support and applicable program oversight to the space operations squadrons) * 710th Operations Group ** 380th Space Control Squadron (associate unit to 16th Space Control Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base) ** 8th Space Warning Squadron (operates Space- Based Infrared System at Buckley Air Force Base) ** Detachment 1 8th Space Warning Squadron * 310th Mission Support Group ** 310th Security Forces Squadron ** 710th Security Forces Squadron ** 310th Force Support Squadron ** 310th Communications Flight (associate unit to 561st Network Operations Squadron (INOSC West) at Peterson Air Force Base) * Reserve National Security Space Institute (associate unit to the NSSI) History =World War II= B-25Js of the 310th Bombardment Group release 1,000 pound bombs over a cloud- obscured Po Valley in northern Italy, 1944. The unit was constituted as the 310th Bombardment Group (Medium) on 28 January 1942 and activated on 15 March 1942. Used B-25s in preparing for duty overseas. Moved to the Mediterranean theater by single aircraft between October 1942 and March 1943 and assigned to Twelfth Air Force. Sufficient aircraft were on hand by 2 December, when it conducted its first operation against antiaircraft concentrations at Gabes, Tunisia. Engaged primarily in support and interdictory operations in Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, Corsica, Sardinia, and southern France. The 310th Bomb Group also flew some missions to Austria and Yugoslavia. The unit attacked harbors and shipping to help defeat Axis forces in North Africa, December 1942 – May 1943. Bombed airdromes, landing grounds, and gun emplacements on Pantelleria, Lampedusa, and Sicily, May–July 1943. The unit supported the Allied landing at Salerno, September 1943. Assisted the drive toward Rome, January–June 1944. Supported the invasion of Southern France, August 1944. Struck German communications— bridges, rail lines, marshalling yards, viaducts, tunnels, and road junctions in Italy, August 1943 – April 1945. Also dropped propaganda leaflets behind enemy lines. The 310th Bomb Group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for a mission to Italy on 27 August 1943 when, in spite of persistent attacks by enemy interceptors and antiaircraft artillery, the group effectively bombed marshalling yards at Benevento and also destroyed a number of enemy planes. Received second DUC for another mission in Italy on 10 March 1945 when the group, maintaining a compact formation in the face of severe antiaircraft fire, bombed the railroad bridge at Ora, a vital link in the German supply line. The 310th Bomb Group was inactivated in Italy on 12 September 1945. The unit was redesignated the 310th Bombardment Group, Light and allotted to the reserve. Activated in the US on 27 December 1946. Inactivated on 27 June 1949. =Cold War= The 310th Bombardment Wing was activated in 1952 as a Strategic Air Command unit, receiving Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombardment training from 90th Bombardment Wing, April–August 1952. From February through May 1953, the 310th Bomb Wing provided bombardment training to the 40th Bombardment Wing. Replaced the propeller-driven B-29s with new Boeing B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. Participated in SAC REFLEX deployments, deploying to RAF Upper Heyford, England, 10 March – 8 June 1955, and at RAF Greenham Common, England, 3 October 1956 – 9 January 1957. The wing gained a strategic missile squadron in April 1961. First CGM-16 Atlas missiles went on alert in September 1962. In the early 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. B-47s began being sent to AMARC at Davis–Monthan in early 1965; was inactivated in late June. =Air Force Space Command= Members of the 7th Space Operations Squadron check on the status of a satellite to ensure it is operating within normal parameters. On 1 September 1991, the third wing to hold the \\"310\\" designation, the 310th Training and Test Wing (310 TTW), assumed the ICBM testing and training mission from the Strategic Missile Center at Vandenberg AFB, California under the Twentieth Air Force. After removal of ICBMs from alert status at the end of the Cold War, the 310 TTW continued to train Minuteman crews and to test accuracy and reliability of Minuteman and Peacekeeper missiles. The 310 TTW also assisted in testing the Global Positioning System (GPS) April 1992 – May 1992. It was reassigned to Air Combat Command on 31 May 1992. It was inactivated on 1 July 1993. The 310th designator was again activated with the stand up of the 310th Space Group 4 September 1997. The group was created around its original squadron, the 7th SOPS, and has grown rapidly with the realization of the critical role the Air Force Reserve can play in the future of space operations. The group has been tremendously successful in its initial missions and has been tasked with reviewing future active/Reserve partnerships in space to identify potential areas where the AF Reserve can add value in the space arena. Air Force Reserve Command officials are expanding the role reservists play in space operations by establishing AFRC's first space wing at Schriever Air Force Base. Command officials activated the 310th Space Wing on 7 March 2008.

international flow of SMS between operators, reshaping the way that international mobile inter-operability works by implementing hubs to intermediate the SMS traffic and to offer a larger SMS coverage. The GSM Association (GSMA) found in SMS Hubbing the solution to a problem that limits the continuing growth of international SMS, culminating to the development of the SMS Hubbing trials in 2006, part of the Open Connectivity project. This initiative created a new structure for international SMS interoperability, as well as developed standards and requirements that SMS hubs should follow.Open Connectivity SMS Hubbing Architecture Regardless of the maturity of the operator or number of subscribers, each subscriber expects to be able to send an SMS to other subscribers, regardless of country and mobile network. Background The lack of complete international SMS interoperability is caused by the way the GSM world is interconnected: each operator has a need to establish SMS interworking with all other mobile operators, meaning that international SMS can only transit from one operator to another if there is a bi-lateral roaming agreement in place. While SMS interoperability is limited to bi-lateral interworking / roaming agreements between operators, it is unlikely that full international SMS reach will be achieved by setting up more and more agreements, which are time-consuming and costly to put in place. In addition to that, the revenue benefits of an extra interworking connection might not justify the investment required to set it up in the first place. SMS hubbing enables a broad international SMS coverage for mobile operators (“client operators”) through the connection to independent hubs, who have multiple agreements in place with other operators, therefore being able to route messages on behalf of the client operators. SMS Hubbing works with the same concept of voice connectivity model: rather than relying on costly and multiple individual agreements, voice traffic flows via telehouses, which are basically hubs for voice. In the same way, many operators connect to hubs to transit MMS messages, in an attempt to fix the many interoperability problems with this messaging technology. SMS Hubbing is about simplifying the SMS interworking system, by replacing much of the unproductive, identical investments in international agreements made traditionally by mobile operators. As well as this, SMS Hubbing is about providing a higher level of service to SMS, by introducing end-to-end quality of service through Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It is clear that SMS Hubbing does not replace bilateral agreements. Every operator has the need to establish roaming agreements in order to provide subscribers with the possibility to roam outside their home network. Outside this frame of main roaming agreements that generate the majority of international traffic for voice and messaging, it makes sense for mobile operators to allocate SMS traffic that belongs to non- connected destinations to an SMS hub. Benefits With the SMS Hubbing model, an operator looking to increase their international SMS coverage does not need to manage multiple bi-lateral agreements. Mobile operators can simplify this by connecting to a hub. The SMS Hubbing model reduces complexity for operators, as well the cost for SMS interworking agreements. Mobile subscribers also take advantage of an enlarged SMS reach, being able to send and receive message to all countries and networks. Ubiquity and simplicity in increasing SMS coverage SMS Hubbing allows operators to manage a single legal, technical and billing relationship rather than hundreds of additional roaming agreements for SMS messaging only. Mobile operators have been gradually outsourcing non-core functions to invest on areas that need a closer management of the operator, as well as focusing on areas that have a direct interface to customers. The hub concept follows this trend, removing a costly and complex area of technical interface and replacing it with a more efficient and effective outsourced solution. Business model Under the GSMA's SMS Hubbing structure, a hub will negotiate a transit fee with an originating operator on a per-SMS basis for the use of the hub. As is the usual practice, the originating operator will also pay a termination fee to the terminating operator, also on a per-SMS basis.

Its last known assignment was at Christchurch, New Zealand, where it was activated for the summer 2005–2006 season. The unit's origins lie with its predecessor unit, the United States Army Air Forces 500th Bombardment Group, which was part of Twentieth Air Force during World War II. The 500th engaged in very heavy (Boeing B-29 Superfortress) bombardment operations against Japan. It was awarded two Distinguished Unit Citations for actions in 1945. The 500th Air Refueling Wing replaced the 4045th Air Refueling Wing as a Strategic Air Command tanker unit at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan on 1 January 1963. The two units were consolidated in 1984. In 2002, the consolidated unit was converted to provisional status as the 500th Air Expeditionary Group. It has been activated several times to support operations in Antarctica. History =World War II= Rare photo of a World War II USAAF Helicopter ferrying parts to a 500th Bomb Group B-29 on its hardstand, Saipan, 1945 Base Operations, Isely Field, Saipan, 1945 \\"Supine Sue\\", first B-29 on Saipan, November 1944 The group was established as the 500th Bombardment Group in late 1943 at Gowen Field, Idaho. It was formed as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment group. The unit was initially composed of with four bombardment squadrons, the 881st, 882d, 883d, and 884th Bombardment Squadrons, the 29th, 30th, 31st and 32d Bombardment Maintenance Squadrons and the 18th Photographic Laboratory (Bombardment, Very Heavy). Due to a shortage of B-29s, the group was equipped with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses already at Gowen Field. These aircraft were previously used for training heavy bomber replacement personnel. In January the unit moved to Clovis Army Air Field, New Mexico due to the poor flying weather during the winter in Idaho. It moved to Walker Army Air Field, Kansas in April 1944 where it finally received newly manufactured B-29 Superfortresses from the Boeing plant at Wichita, Kansas. In May the United States Army Air Forces reconfigured its very heavy groups and the 884th Bombardment Squadron and the Bombardment Maintenance Squadrons were inactivated. Their personnel were consolidated into the remaining squadrons.The 884th was reactivated a month later as part of the 383d Bombardment Group. The 500th deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations in September 1944, where it was assigned to the 73d Bombardment Wing of XXI Bomber Command in the Northern Mariana Islands, at Isely Field, Saipan. Upon their arrival the group's personnel engaged in Quonset hut construction. By mid-October most personnel were able to move into the huts from the tents which they were assigned to on their arrival in theater. The 500th's assigned tail code was a Z-Square. It entered combat on 11 November 1944 with an attack against a submarine base in the Truk Islands. On 24 November, the 500th participated in the first attack on Japan by B-29's based in the Marianas. After that attack, the group conducted many daylight raids, operating from high altitude to bomb strategic targets in Japan. It struck the Mitsubishi aircraft engine plant at Nagoya in January 1945 and received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for the mission. The group bombed enemy airfields and other installations on Kyūshū in support of the Allied assault on Okinawa in April 1945. Beginning in March 1945, the group flew missions at night and at low altitude to drop incendiaries on area targets in Japan. It received a second DUC for incendiary attacks on the urban-industrial section of Osaka, feeder industries at Hamamatsu, and shipping and rail targets on Kyūshū during June. The group released propaganda leaflets over the Japanese home islands in July and August, continuing strategic bombing raids and incendiary attacks until the Japanese capitulation in August 1945. After V-J Day, the 500th dropped supplies to Allied prisoners, participated in show- of-force missions, and flew over Japan to evaluate bombardment damage. In October 1945 the unit returned to the United States. It was assigned to Continental Air Forces' Fourth Air Force at March Field, California. However demobilization was in full swing and the group was inactivated on 17 January 1946. =Cold War= 4045th Air Refueling Wing Patch The 500th Air Refueling Wing was activated and established in 1963 as part of Strategic Air Command at Selfridge AFB, Michigan. The wing replaced the 4045th Air Refueling Wing at Selfridge, absorbing its personnel and assets. The 4045th Wing had been established at Selfridge on 1 January 1959, along with three maintenance squadrons and a security unit and assigned to Second Air Force. The 44th Air Refueling Squadron and 307th Air Refueling Squadron moved from Chennault AFB, Louisiana in June 1960 and were assigned to the wing as its operational squadrons. In September, the wing was reassigned to the 17th Air Division. In 1962, in order to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its Major Command controlled (MAJCON) wings that were equipped with tactical aircraft and to activate Air Force controlled (AFCON) units, most of which were inactive at the time which could carry a lineage and history.MAJCON units could not carry a permanent history or lineage. As a result, the 4045th was replaced by the newly constituted 500th Air Refueling Wing on 1 January 1963.Although the 500th Wing was a new organization, it continued, through temporary bestowal, the history, and honors of the World War II 500th Bombardment Group. It was also entitled to retain the honors (but not the history or lineage) of the 4045th. This temporary bestowal ended in January 1984, when the wing and group were consolidated into a single unit. The two refueling squadrons were reassigned to the 500th wing. The 4045th's maintenance and security squadrons were replaced by ones with the 500th numerical designation of the newly established wing. Each of the new units assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of its predecessor. The wing was reassigned to the 40th Air Division on 1 July 1963. The wing supported SAC bombardment and Tactical Air Command fighter aircraft with air refueling and occasionally deployed segments of its tanker force overseas to support unit movements and special operations. The unit was discontinued and inactivated on 15 December 1964. The two units were consolidated in 1984.Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 539q, 31 January 1984, Subject: Consolidation of Units =Expeditionary Operations= LC-130 of the New York Air National Guard onloading fuel and cargo for an Antarctic mission The consolidated unit was redesignated as the 500th Air Expeditionary Group and activated in 2003 to conduct Operation Deep Freeze activities under Pacific Air Forces, before being replaced by the 13th Air Expeditionary Group. During deployments to support Deep Freeze, the group had controlled ski- equipped Lockheed LC-130 Hercules aircraft of the 139th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron and McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III aircraft of the 304th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron.U.S. Antarctic Program Participant Guide, 2010–2012, pp. 91–93, Glossary (retrieved July 1, 2013) Lineage 500th Bombardment Group * Constituted as 500th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy on 19 November 1943 : Activated on 20 November 1943 : Inactivated on 17 January 1946 * Consolidated with 500th Air Refueling Wing as 500th Air Refueling Wing on 31 January 1984 (remained inactive) 500th Air Expeditionary Group * Established as 500th Air Refueling Wing on 15 November 1962 : Activated on 15 November 1962 (not organized) : Organized on 1 January 1963 : Discontinued and inactivated, 15 December 1964 * Consolidated with 500th Bombardment Group on 31 January 1984 (remained inactive) * Redesignated 500th Air Expeditionary Group and converted to provisional status on 12 June 2002Department of the Air Force/XPM Letter 303s, 12 June 2002, Subject: Air Mobility Command Expeditionary Units : Activated on 15 August 2003 : Inactivated on 1 March 2004 : Activated on 15 August 2004 : Inactivated on 28 February 2005 : Activated on 19 July 2005 : Inactivated unknown (probably February 2006). =Assignments= * Second Air Force, 20 November 1943 – 23 July 1944 (attached to 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing), 16 April – 23 July 1944 * 73d Bombardment Wing, 18 September 1944 – 21 October 1945 * Fifteenth Air Force, 24 October 1945 – 17 January 1946 * Strategic Air Command, 15 November 1962 (not organized) * 17th Strategic Aerospace Division, 1 June 1963 * 40th Air Division, 1 July 1963 – 15 December 1964 * Air Mobility Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 12 June 2002 :: attached to Support Forces, Antarctica, 15 August 2003 – 1 March 2004 :: attached to Support Forces, Antarctica, 15 August 2004 – 28 February 2005 :: 500th Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force, 29 July 2005 – unknown =Components= Tactical Squadrons * 139th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron * 304th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron * 44th Air Refueling Squadron, 1 January 1963 – 15 December 1964 (detached 10 July 1963 – 10 October 1963) * 307th Air Refueling Squadron, 1 January 1963 – 15 December 1964 (detached 31 July 1963 – 5 October 1963) * 881st Bombardment Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 17 January 1946 * 882d Bombardment Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 17 January 1946 * 883d Bombardment Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 17 January 1946 * 884th Bombardment Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 10 May 1944 Support Units * 29th Bombardment Maintenance Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 10 May 1944 * 30th Bombardment Maintenance Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 10 May 1944 * 31st Bombardment Maintenance Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 10 May 1944 * 32d Bombardment Maintenance Squadron, 20 November 1943 – 10 May 1944 * 18th Photographic Laboratory, 20 November 1943 – ca. 17 January 1946 =Stations= * Gowen Field, Idaho, 20 November 1943 – 12 January 1944 * Clovis Army Air Field, New Mexico, 12 January – 16 April 1944 * Walker Army Air Field, Kansas, 16 April – 23 July 1944 * Isely Field, Saipan, Mariana Islands, 18 September 1944 – 21 October 1945 * March Field, California, 24 October 1945 – 17 January 1946 * Selfridge AFB, Michigan, 1 January 1963 – 15 December 1964 * Christchurch, New Zealand, 15 August 2003 – 1 March 2004 * Christchurch, New Zealand, 15 August 2004 – 28 February 2005 * Christchurch, New Zealand, 29 July 2005 – unknown =Aircraft= * Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1943–1946 * Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker, 1963–1964 References =Notes= ; Explanatory notes ; Citations =Bibliography=  * 500th ARW – Strategic Air Command.com External links * 500th Bomb Group Illustrated History Website * March Field Museum Boeing B-29A Superfortress 44-61669 from the 500th Bomb Group Air expeditionary groups of the United States Air Force Japan campaign World War II strategic bombing units ","title":"500th Air Expeditionary Group"},{"id":"9771232","text":"Knockin Castle by T.F.

The virus was first isolated in 1952 in Cairo, Egypt. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes (Culex spp.) SINV causes sindbis fever in humans and the symptoms include arthralgia, rash and malaise. Sindbis fever is most common in Southern Africa, East Africa, Egypt, Palestine, the Philippines and parts of Australia. It is an arbovirus, meaning that it is _ar_ thropod- _bo_ rne, and is maintained in nature by transmission between vertebrate (bird) hosts and invertebrate (mosquito) vectors. Humans are infected with Sindbis virus when bitten by an infected mosquito. SINV has been linked to Pogosta disease in Finland,Kurkela S, Manni T, Vaheri A, Vapalahti O. Causative agent of Pogosta disease isolated from blood and skin lesions, Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. Published 2004 May. (accessed 2007-10-16) Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Karelian fever in Russia. Virus physiology Structure, genome & replication Sindbis viruses are enveloped particles with an icosahedral capsid. Its genome is a positive single stranded RNA approximately 11.7kb long. It has a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail therefore serves directly as messenger RNA (mRNA) in a host cell. The genome encodes four non-structural proteins at the 5' end and the capsid and two envelope proteins at the 3' end. This is characteristic of all Togaviruses. Replication is cytoplasmic and rapid. The genomic RNA is partially translated at the 5’ end to produce the non-structural proteins which are then involved in genome replication and the production of new genomic RNA and a shorter sub- genomic RNA strand. This sub-genomic strand is translated into the structural proteins. The viruses assemble at the host cell surfaces and acquire their envelope through budding. A non-coding RNA element has been found to be essential for Sindbis virus genome replication. Recombination has been demonstrated between RNAs of Sindbis virus.Lai MM. RNA recombination in animal and plant viruses. Microbiol Rev. 1992 Mar;56(1):61-79. PMID: 1579113; PMCID: PMC372854Weiss BG, Schlesinger S. Recombination between Sindbis virus RNAs.

In humans, there are three formyl peptide receptor isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene that are named FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors were originally identified by their ability to bind N-formyl peptides such as N-formylmethionine produced by the degradation of either bacterial or host cells. Hence formyl peptide receptors are involved in mediating immune cell response to infection. These receptors may also act to suppress the immune system under certain conditions. The close phylogenetic relation of signaling in chemotaxis and olfaction was recently proved by detection formyl peptide receptor like proteins as a distinct family of vomeronasal organ chemosensors in mice. FPR is now properly accepted as termed FPR1 by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.  Discovery  Studies conducted in the 1970s found that a series of N-Formylmethionine-containing oligopeptides, including the most potent and best known member of this series, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF or fMet-Leu-Phe), stimulated rabbit and human neutrophils by an apparent receptor-dependent mechanism to migrate in a directional pattern in classical laboratory assays of chemotaxis. Since these oligopeptides were produced by bacteria or synthetic analogs of such products, it was suggested that the N-formyl oligopeptides are important chemotatic factors and their receptors are important chemotactic factor receptors that act respectively as signaling and signal-recognizing elements to initiate inflammation responses in order to defend against bacterial invasion. Further studies defined a receptor for the N-formyl oligopeptides, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), so named based on its ability to bind and become activated by the oligopeptides. Two receptors where thereafter discovered and named FPR1 and FPR2 based on the similarity of their genes' predicted amino acid sequence to that of FPR rather than on any ability to bind or be activated by the formyl oligopeptides. These three receptors have been renamed as FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3 and found to have very different specificities for the formyl oligopeptides and very different functions that include initiating inflammatory responses to N-formyl peptides released not only by bacteria but also a multiplicity of elements released by host tissues; dampening and resolving inflammatory responses; and perhaps contributing to the development of certain neurological cancers and an array of neurological diseases Amyloid-based diseases.  Structure and function  The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) belongs to the class of receptors possessing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The conformation of the FPR is stabilized by several interactions. These include potential salt bridge formation between Arg84-Arg205, Lys85-Arg205, and Lys85-Asp284 which help determine the three- dimensional structure of transmembrane domains, as well as positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) which interact with negatively charged phosphates. Furthermore, residue Arg163 may interact with the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop of the FPR. With respect to binding of the formyl Met-Leu-Phe peptide, there are additional potential interactions which include hydrogen bonding interactions between Arg84 and Lys85 of the first extracellular loop and the N-formyl group of the ligand as well as the peptide backbone of formyl Met-Leu-Phe which can form similar interactions. The formyl-Met moiety of the ligand was shown to form disulfide bridges with Cys residues, and an interaction with Arg163 was also demonstrated. (It is important to mention that some interaction which stabilize the conformation of the receptor may also influence ligand-binding.) Some oligopeptides were also described as characteristic constituents linked to Asn-s of the extracellular N terminal part and to the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop. These components can also determine or make more specific the ligand- receptor interaction.  Signaling pathways  Induction of FPR triggers multiple changes in eukaryotic cells including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton which in turn facilitates cell migration and the synthesis of chemokines. Important FPR regulated pathways include: * G protein dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which results in the breakdown of the membrane constituent phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 is one of the most effective inducers of Ca2+ increase from cytoplasmic pools and from outside the cell via opening Ca2+ channels. DAG in turn is an inducer of protein kinase C (PKC). * Activation of the regulatory small GTPase, RAS. The active RAS can in turn activate RAF, a Ser/Thr kinase. In the next step mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are activated. (Also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases - ERKs or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)). As a result of the last step, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated. The phosphorylated forms of ERKs can continue the cascade by triggering activation more interacting kinases which results in altered transcriptional activity in the nucleus. * Ligand binding to FPR can also induce the activation of CD38, an ectoenzyme of the surface membrane. As a result of activation NAD+ molecules will enter the cytoplasm. NAD+ is converted into cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), a second messenger which interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The overall result of the process is increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via the direct pathway described above and also via indirect pathways such as opening of Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane. The sustained increase of Ca2+ is required for directed migration of the cells.

Joshua Meyrowitz originated the term in his 1985 book, No Sense of Place. Other scholars with work relevant to medium theory include Marshall McLuhan (1963, 1966, 1988) and Neil Postman (1985). Currently, medium theory occupies a marginal position within U.S. communication and media studies (Croteau & Hoynes, 2003:305). The majority of U.S. communication and media studies place their emphasis on the content of communication (e.g., sex and violence) not the medium of communications. In Canada and elsewhere, the theory continues to inform studies that assess large-scale social changes that follow the adoption of a new medium. German media theory operates along similar lines and is influenced by McLuhan, though it occupies a more central location in German academia. Joshua Meyrowitz (1985) uses the term 'medium theory' to refer to the body of literature that focuses on the technological aspects of media beyond their content. It aims to look beyond the content to the medium which reveals the key to its social impact (Croteau & Hoynes, 2003:305). McLuhan's message Marshall McLuhan is best known for his phrase \\"the medium is the message\\". McLuhan believed that we should observe not only the media itself but 'the ways in which each new medium disrupts tradition and reshapes social life' (Croteau & Hoynes 2003,307). He believed that the social impact of the media was that they became 'an extension of our senses, and alter our social world' (Croteau & Hoynes, 2003:307). In his book The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) McLuhan argued that when new media technologies were introduced into society, the balance of our senses were reworked, highlighting some at the expense of others. For example, print intensified the visual and separated it from our other senses; in particular sound. \\"McLuhan even argued that print media helped create a sensory environment that produced Western capitalist societies - an environment that was bureaucratic and organized around mass production, an ideology of individualism, and a commitment to the nation-state as the fundamental social unit.\\" Technological determinism Medium theory has always been criticized by its technological determinism. Raymond Williams is one of the most ardent critics of this concept. He believed that technological determinism 'emerges' from Technical study and experiments and then changes the sector or society in which it emerged from. Which means that we adapt towards the new technologies that arise because it is the new modern way of doing it. The deterministic approach says that technology in itself has the power to change societies and the power to condition humans even though humans are the ones that's using said technology. Although McLuhan strongly believes that the introduction to any new media will change the way we live, Williams argue that the new technology in itself has no real significance to social value unless it has been adapted to existing social and economic conditions.

Biography =Early years= Arthur Rosenberg was born into a German Jewish middle-class family in Berlin on 19 December 1889. But he was baptized as a christian.{https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge- datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/arthur-rosenberg Bundesstiftung Aufarbeitung: Arthur Rosenberg (german)] He excelled at the Askanisches Gymnasium before studying at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin with Otto Hirschfeld and Eduard Meyer. Rosenberg established himself as an expert in Roman constitutional history and held a PhD (1911) in ancient history and archeology.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch (eds.), Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. Revised Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 401-402. In 1914, Rosenberg proved to be a conformist representative of the German academy, believing in the \\"ideas of 1914,\\" and signing nationalist petitions. He then was drafted into the army, working for the Kriegspresseamt, the public relations office of the army. =Political career= After Germany's defeat in 1918 and his demobilization from the army, Rosenberg joined the new Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD).Pavel Broiué, The German Revolution, 1917-1923. John Archer, trans. Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2006; pp. 982-983. He went on to join the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1920. Rosenberg emerged as an important theoretician for the dissident left wing of the KPD in their ongoing factional struggle with the party leadership headed by Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer. He was regarded as one of the top leaders of the party left in the city of Berlin and was an advocate of the theory that the KPD should pursue a revolutionary offensive against the Weimar state. The left wing gained control of the KPD in April 1924 and Rosenberg was elected a member of the governing Central Committee of the party as well as a delegate to the 5th Congress of the Communist International and a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) that same year. Rosenberg denounced the Dawes Plan as a plot by American capitalists and international Jewry to take control of the German economy. However he rejoiced that the Plan would \\"drive the last nails into the coffin of the German Republic\\". He said the Communists were ready to give the Republic the final shove so that it would \\"meet the fate that it deserves\\".Stephen A. Schuker, The End of French Predominance in Europe. The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1976), p. 391. When further factionalism swept the German Communist Party, Rosenberg maintained an ultra-left wing line as part of a factional group that included Werner Scholem, Iwan Katz, and Karl Korsch.E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia (Volume 7): Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 1. London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 322. This group fell into disfavor in Moscow from June 1925, however. In electing a new Central Committee the German party was invited by ECCI \\"to have no fear of drawing into the work the best elements from former groups not belonging to the Left\\" — an effort to further undercut Rosenberg's factional group. Despite the criticism, Rosenberg was named a delegate to the 6th Enlarged Plenum of the CI in February 1926, at which he participated. Expulsions of the left wing of the KPD followed in 1927, but Rosenberg was not himself one of those subject to such treatment. Nevertheless, he quit the KPD in April 1927, moving from the political realm to the field of scholarship. He taught at the University of Berlin and served as the head of an organization called the League of Rights of Man. =Years of exile= When the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 Rosenberg was dismissed from his university post due to his Jewish ethnicity. Rosenberg emigrated first to Switzerland before moving on to the United Kingdom. From 1934 to 1937 Rosenberg taught history at the University of Liverpool. He proceeded to the United States in 1937 to take a professorship at Brooklyn College, where he taught and wrote until the end of his life. =Death and legacy= Arthur Rosenberg died 7 February 1943 in New York City. In the 1960s, his books came to more widespread attention among German historians. Footnotes Works * Imperial Germany: The Birth of the German Republic, 1871–1918.

The name is Latin for \\"voice.\\" Some Vox releases such as Peter Frankl's Debussy Piano Works and Gyorgy Sandor's Complete Prokofiev Sonatas were reissued in premium vinyl boxsets by the audiophile German FSM Records Hamburg. More recently, the Brendel Complete Beethoven Sonatas is being remastered from the original tapes to SACD and for HD downloads. History Vox was founded in 1945 in New York by George Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. Starting out with 78-rpm discs, it specialized in licensed pressings of classical recordings made in Europe. It was one of the last major recording companies to adopt stereo recording, about 1957. The company's output featured the \\"Vox Box\\", compilations of music by specific composers, such as piano music of Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and Ravel; the complete symphonies and orchestral music of Rachmaninoff; rarely heard orchestral music by Tchaikovsky, Massenet, and Rimsky-Korsakov; the complete orchestral music of the eccentric French composer Erik Satie; and one of the most complete collections of the music of the early American composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Vox had subsidiary labels including Turnabout and Candide. Both labels generally focused on contemporary music. In recent years, some Vox recordings were rereleased on the Excelsior label. Although Vox specialized in imported recordings, it also recorded the Utah Symphony Orchestra under Maurice Abravanel, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin and Walter Susskind, the Minnesota Orchestra under Stanisław Skrowaczewski, and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under Thomas Schippers, Walter Susskind and Michael Gielen. In the early 1970s, Vox and its subsidiaries issued a number of compatible quadraphonic/stereophonic recordings using the Sansui QS quadraphonic matrix system; some of the ambience can still be heard when the CD versions are played with an amplifier with Dolby decoding and four speakers. One of these was the first album made by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, led by Robert Shaw, a 2-LP set entitled Nativity. Many of its recordings were later issued on CD. The company has continued a program of new releases, too, by such orchestras as the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.Eyewitness account by Robert E. Nylund In 1978, the label was acquired by Moss Music Group. Notable releases In the course of its existence, Vox has displayed a willingness to explore unusual literature and a penchant for covering broad swaths of repertory in comprehensive releases. Among its numerous noteworthy issues were the following: *During the 1950s, Vox released the first nominally complete cycle of Schubert's piano sonatas on records, performed by the Austrian pianist Friedrich Wührer; it omitted a few fragmentary works but did include Ernst Krenek's rarely recorded completion of the Sonata in C Major, D. 840 (Reliquie). At first issued as single records with uniform jacket art, the series later appeared in two different sets of three Vox Boxes—one, with gold covers and red labels, monaural as originally recorded and the other, with white covers and purple labels, rechanneled for ersatz stereo. Vox subsequently replaced Wührer's cycle with one in true stereo recorded by Walter Klien; unlike its predecessor, the latter set has appeared in CD reissues as noted below. *Vox released one of the few complete recordings of Tchaikovsky's rarely heard third piano concerto, as reconstructed by Sergei Ivanovich Taneyev (1856–1915), with pianist Michael Ponti. This performance has been included in a Vox Box (released in 1991) featuring Tchaikovsky's three piano concertos and the seldom-performed Concert Fantasy, Op. 56, all performed by Ponti, with the Prague Symphony Orchestra conducted by Richard Kapp (in the first and second concertos and the fantasy) and the Orchestra of Radio Luxembourg conducted by Louis de Froment. *Vox issued recordings of the French composer Darius Milhaud directing the Luxembourg Philharmonic in his complete symphonies. * In the 1960s pianist Frank Glazer recorded for Vox the complete piano music of Erik Satie. This recording was declared \\"the finest interpretation of the piano music of Eric Satie\\".Edward Greenfield in \\"The Second Penguin Guide to Bargain Records\\" - E.

He was born on 12 December 1872 in Breslau, the second child of Jewish parents, Julius and Julcher Cassirer. Julius was a partner, with two of Bruno's cousins, in a cable factory. Julius completed his final school examination in 1890 at the Leibniz-Gymnasium. In 1898, together with his cousin Paul Cassirer, he opened a gallery and bookshop at 35 Viktoriastraße near Kemperplatz, Berlin. On 2 May 1898 the artists' association Berlin Secession was established with Paul and Bruno as secretaries. For three years they acquainted the art and literature scenes of Berlin with the newest waves from Belgian, English, French and Russian culture. In 1901, Bruno and Paul divided the business into separate parts, with Paul running the gallery and art dealership, whilst Bruno owned the publishing side which relocated to 15 Derfflingerstraße. In 1902 he founded the monthly art journal Kunst und Künstler (Art and Artist) which turned out to become an influential and prestigious forum until it was closed down by the Nazis in 1933. In 1903 Christian Morgenstern joined as literary editor and the journal \\"Das Theater\\" was founded under his direction. In 1936 Jewish printers were removed from membership of the Reichsschrifttumskammer (RSK) and the last book appeared from the Cassirer publishing house. In 1938 part of the Cassirer family decided to emigrate to Oxford where Bruno founded a new publishing house. He died on 20 October 1941 in Oxford, England.

It is located off the northern tip of Borneo and is situated just about 3 kilometres west of Banggi Island. It is now part of the Tun Mustapha Marine Park. History Alexander Dalrymple, an officer of the British East India Company (EIC), concluded an agreement with Sultan Bantilan Muizzud-Din on 12 September 1762 whereby the Sultanate of Sulu ceded the island of Balambangan to the company, and Dalrymple took possession of the island on 22 January 1763.Warren (1981), pp. 18-19 The establishment of a factory on Balambangan was officially approved by a committee of the board of directors in 1768 and Dalrymple was offered the role of management of the new settlement.Hall (1981), pp. 535-536 However, Dalrymple quarrelled with the directors, and his insistence on absolute management of Balambangan led to his dismissal in March 1771. Dalrymple was replaced by John Herbert who commanded the Britannia as it transported soldiers, goods, and supplies from India in 1772, and arrived at Balambangan in December 1773. The settlement traded opium, munitions, and fabrics with the Tausugs and Maguindanaons. Herbert's mismanagement of Balambangan and poor relations with the Tausugs resulted in the settlement's destruction on 26 February 1775 at the hands of Moro pirates,Warren (1981), p. 36 and Herbert and other survivors escaped to Brunei. In the second half of the 18th century, the Dutch from Batavia attempted to settle the island's western coast, but withdrew by 1797. In 1803, in response to the restitution of the Moluccas to the Dutch as per the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Lord Wellesley, Governor-General of India, decided upon the resettlement of Balambangan, and instructed R. J. Farquhar, the British Resident at Amboina, to manage the expedition.Hall (1981), p. 540 Farquhar reestablished the settlement at Balambangan by the end of September 1803, but the ships and Thornhill were wrecked off the coast of Banggi Island whilst en route from Malacca to Balambangan on 23 September, and the was destroyed by fire in the settlement's harbour on 29 October.Campbell (1806), p. 89Clarke & McArthur (2010), p. 467 Farquhar remained at Balambangan until he left for Penang on 7 December, and a commissioner was appointed to manage the settlement. Balambangan came under the jurisdiction of Penang, and as lieutenant governor of Penang, Farquhar planned to fortify the settlement on Balambangan, but the resumption of war with France led the court of directors of the EIC to veto the plan, and the island was abandoned in 1805. In December 1805, five members of the ill-fated crew of shipwrecked schooner Betsey made it off Balambangan Island in a small boat despite being attacked by eleven natives; however, one sailor died in the boat due to his injuries.Bateson (1972), p. 40 See also * List of islands of Malaysia References Bibliography  * Islands of Sabah 1762 establishments in the British Empire 1800s disestablishments in the British Empire ","title":"Balambangan Island"},{"id":"9771859","text":"Disodium inosinate Disodium guanylate Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides, E number E635, is a flavor enhancer which is synergistic with glutamates in creating the taste of umami.

Architecture It is located in a building that was constructed in 1898 by architect Władysław Horodecki for the Kyiv City Museum. It was in fact a remake of the talented Moscow architect Petr Boitsov who failed to receive a government license. The building was originally designed as a museum for the local society of patrons of arts and antique lovers. The facade of the building conveys a neoclassical architecture form - precise reproduction of a six-column porch of Doric order with entablature, triglyphs, metopes and frieze decoration depicting the Triumph of Arts. The architectural composition featuring figures of gryphons and large concrete lions at the top of the stairs were created by an Italian sculptor, Emilio Sala. On the construction of the building was expended 249,000 rubles with only 100,000 paid by the government of Russian Empire. Another 108,000 rubles were paid by the Tereshchenko family who also created the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kyiv. At first, at the first floor was located exhibition of the Russian archeologist Vikentiy Khvoyka who moved to Kyiv from the Kingdom of Bohemia. The museum officially opened just before Christmas on 23 December 1904 as the Kyiv Industrial Arts and Science museum of Emperor Nicholas II. The first director of museum became Mykola Biliashivsky. In 1936 the museum became known as the Kyiv State Museum of Ukrainian Arts and in 1964 as the State Museum of Decorative Arts of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. History The competitive project presented by the Museum of Antiquities and Arts. The main facade, 1898 Originally called the Kiev City Museum of Antiques and Art, the founders set out to put together a collection of pieces representative of Ukrainian fine art. Ranging from medieval icons to portraits of military and church leaders during Cossack times, some depicting caricatures of Mamay. Present time famous artist works included those of Taras Shevchenko, Ilya Yefimovich Repin, Vladimir Borovikovsky, Vasily Andreevich Tropinin, Mykola Pimonenko, Mikhail Vrubel, Nikolai Ge, Serhiy Svetoslavsky, and Oleksandr Murashko among many others. After World War I, the museum also served as the Museum of History. One of its most memorable expositions displayed an old trophy tank, which was lent by the Triple Entente to the White Army. After World War II the museum changed its name and its focus back to art. The collection began to grow, with Ukrainian art coming from all areas of Ukraine, and from places like Galicia. The directors obtained Ukrainian art from Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as from Ukrainian artists living abroad in Europe and America. However, during Joseph Stalin's repression, this activity ceased, and a large part of the collection was dispersed and hidden. After Ukrainian independence, the museum reached the status of a major international institution. For the first time, its collections traveled outside of the country and were exhibited in The Netherlands, Canada, France, Denmark, and Croatia. Current exhibition Today, the museum continues to expand its collection. Some new additions include a unique icon relief of St. George and works by the international Kyiv born pioneer of Geometric abstract art Kazimir Malevich. The current exhibition includes over 20 thousand pieces. Among many are works by a now world-renowned constructivist Vasiliy Yermilov, and Cubo-Futurist Alexander Bogomazov. The Ukrainian side is represented by works of famous Ukrainian and Russian artists such as David Burliuk, Aleksandra Ekster, Vadim Meller, Kliment Red'ko, Solomon Nikritin, Victor Palmov, Maria Sinyakova , Mykhailo Boychuk, Mykola Pymonenko, Ilya Shtilman and many others.

Lipstadt Defence Documents Initially a loose group associated with the magazine Die Neue Front, the GdNF was soon formalised into an organisation, taking in most of the membership of the ANS/NA. The group placed itself within the more radical Sturmabteilung tradition of Nazism rather than simple devotion to Adolf Hitler. It also placed importance on opposing the influence of the United States, the destruction of the environment and the weakening of German racial purity. The group was also active in Austria, which it referred to as \\"Ostmark\\", and called for the formation of an Austrian SA in a December 1990 edition of its paper Neuen Front. When Kühnen came out as a homosexual in 1986 the GdNF remained loyal to him in the resulting split, although the group lost control of the Free German Workers' Party.Cyprian Blamires, World fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1, p. 369 However the group continued to improve its organisational basis despite this set-back, staging marches, paramilitary training and setting up cells in the German Democratic Republic. It also sought to build up a portfolio of international contacts with which it co-operated on military drilling, propaganda dissemination and arms dispersal. After the death of Kühnen in 1991, the leadership of the GdNF, which had about 400 fully active members, passed to Worch, Winfried Arnulf Priem and Austrian neo-Nazi leader Gottfried Küssel.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, 1997, p. 253 In Austria the GdNF worked in tandem with Küssel's Volkstreue Außerparlamentarische Opposition (VAPO), a like-minded group.Bernd Baumgartl, Adrian Favell, New Xenophobia in Europe, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1995, p. 23 However without Kühnen the group went into terminal decline and became lost in a sea of similar groups that were formed in the 1990s due to ever closer government scrutiny of neo-Nazi activities. The group continued to publish Neuen Front although increasingly this became an international magazine of neo-Nazism with close links to the NSDAP/AO with the GdNF doing little beyond publishing this work. With Worch jailed in 1996 and other important figures such as Thomas Brehl starting up their own groups the GdNF gradually passed out of existence.

He escaped a death march at Perm in September 1918 and survived to write his memoirs about his time at court and his escape. These include his experience of events such as the Khodynka Tragedy. Early life Volkov was born in the town of Old-Ioriev, Kozlov District, Tambov Guberniya. As a young adult, he entered the Russian Army and rose through the ranks. He was on guard and witnessed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. Later he was a military instructor to Tsar Nicholas II. From 1886, he was in service to Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia. He became a valet at the court of the Tsar in 1910. He was the Tsarina's personal servant and often pushed her wheelchair.Kurth, p. 99 Exile Volkov followed the Tsar's family and household into internal exile following the Russian Revolution of 1917, but was separated from them at Ekaterinburg and imprisoned at Perm. There, he heard that the Tsar had been murdered by Bolsheviks, though he was unaware that the Tsarina and their children had also been shot.von Nidda, p. 135 Escape from death On 4 September 1918, he was taken from his prison cell in the middle of the night and led to the prison office, where he saw lady-in- waiting Anastasia Hendrikova and the elderly tutor Catherine Schneider. They were joined by eight other prisoners, including the chambermaid from the house where Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia had lived. They had an escort of twenty-two guards, none of whom were Russian. Volkov asked a guard where they were being taken and was told they were being taken \\"to the house of arrest.\\" Hendrikova, who had been in the washroom, asked a guard the same question when she came out. She was told they were being taken \\"to the central prison.\\" Hendrikova asked him, \\"and from there?\\" The guard replied, \\"Well! to Moscow.\\" Hendrikova repeated this conversation to her fellow prisoners and made the sign of the cross with her fingers. Volkov took her gesture to mean \\"they will not shoot us.\\" The sailor at the prison office door kept checking the front door that led to the street to make sure no one was there. After a while another sailor said, \\"Let's go.\\" They lined the prisoners up in the street in rows of two, the men in front and the women in back. The group walked all the way to the edge of town and onto the Simbirsk road. Volkov asked another prisoner where the central prison was and was told they had long passed it. Volkov realized they were being taken into the woods to be shot. He broke from the group and ran for his life at the first opportunity. A bullet whizzed past his ear. Behind him he heard gunshots as the other prisoners in the group were shot and killed. Volkov eventually joined other refugees at the White Army headquarters in Omsk and made his escape from Russia through Vladivostok and the Far East. In 1922, he settled in Estonia. He later lived in Denmark, where he was highly respected in the émigré community because of his lifelong loyalty to the Romanov family. Anna Anderson In 1925, Prince Valdemar of Denmark asked Volkov to visit Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Valdemar's great-niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia.Klier and Mingay, p. 99; Kurth, p. 99 Anderson was being treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Berlin for a tubercular infection of her arm. When Volkov first arrived at the hospital, on 3 July 1925, he caught a glimpse of Anderson when she went for a walk in the hospital grounds.Klier and Mingay, p. 99; Kurth, p. 99; von Nidda, p. 135 At that point, Volkov thought Anderson resembled Anastasia, but the next day, they met one another and Volkov was dismayed to find that Anderson could not or would not speak Russian with him.Klier and Mingay, p. 100; Kurth, p. 99; von Nidda, p. 136 Anderson did not recognise him,Klier and Mingay, p. 100; Kurth, p. 99 and Volkov was unable to discern a facial resemblance to Anastasia.Kurth, p. 99; von Nidda, p. 136 The following day, Volkov returned for a third time and expressed his doubts as to her identity, but would not say definitely that Anderson was not Anastasia.Kurth, p. 100; von Nidda, p. 135 On his final visit the following day, 6 July 1925, Anderson correctly answered some of his questions,Kurth, pp. 100–101 and recounted stories of Grand Duchess Anastasia's life before the Revolution that moved Volkov to tears.Klier and Mingay, p. 100; Kurth, p. 101 At the conclusion of his visit, Volkov did not say whether he thought Anderson was or was not Anastasia.Kurth, p. 101 Afterwards, in an interview with the Russian-language newspaper Poslednyi Novosti, published in Estonia on 15 January 1926, Volkov denied Anderson was Anastasia, and decried her as an impostor.Klier and Mingay, p. 100; Kurth, Anastasia, p.122 Volkov's memoirs, Souvenirs d'Alexis Volkov, were published by Payot of Paris in 1928, a year before his death in 1929. Serge Ostrogorsky, a Russian courtier who knew Volkov, claimed after Volkov's death that Volkov had told him that Anderson was not Anastasia and that the encounter had moved him to tears, but also that he admitted that he had kissed her hand.Affidavit of Serge Ostrogorsky, 21 May 1929, Fallows archive, Houghton Library, Harvard University, quoted in Kurth, p. 123 Ostrogorsky claimed that he pressed Volkov to account for the hand-kissing, which \\"he would never have done if someone other than Grand Duchess Anastasia had been standing before him\\". At which point, according to Ostrogorsky, Volkov said, \\"I believe that she is the Grand Duchess, but how can the Grand Duchess speak no Russian?\\" In 1995, DNA tests confirmed that Anderson was not Anastasia. It is now known that Anastasia was murdered along with the rest of the immediate Imperial family on July 18, 1918, but that she and her brother Alexei were buried in a separate location from the rest, and her body was not located until 2007.

It also used to be a mission station of the Finnish Missionary Society. Eenhana is situated in a subtropical forest. It is connected to the road network and has a well-developed infrastructure. Due to the proximity of Angola, many businesses are situated here. The town hosts an annual trade fair. The name Eenhana comes from the word calves in Oshikwanyama and is a reference to the calves that used to water at the small water pan where Eenhana is now located.Eenhana Town Council About us History Eenhana was founded around New Year's Day 1930 by the Reverend Paulus Hamutenya. He was one of the first seven Ovambos to be ordained pastors in Oniipa, Ovamboland, in 1925 by the director of the Finnish Missionary Society, Matti Tarkkanen.Peltola 1958, p. 212. Hamutenya had earlier lived in Edundja, where he had built a church. However, the area became crowded, and he decided to found a new settlement for the Oukwanyama people in the woods, to the east of Engela. Oukwanyamas from Angola had already begun to move in that area. The South West African government made Hamutenya the local head of the tribesmen of Eastern Oukwanyama. In 1932, Hamutenya built a church in Eenhana. He died the same year after a short illness.Peltola 1958, p. 212, 232. The Eenhana mission station was founded by the nurse Linda Helenius in 1936. Eenhana thus became the centre of medical care in Eastern Oukwanyama for several decades. Teacher Suoma Hirvonen soon joined Helenius on this new mission station.Peltola 1958, p. 232. Before Namibian independence it was a military centre of the South African Defence Force without public infrastructure. It was proclaimed a settlement in 1992, and a town in 1999.  Climate  Trade thumb The entrance to Eenhana Open Market The town attempts to attract businesses to the town through business exhibitions, small and medium enterprises and tourism activities. Eenhana hosts two annual trade fairs, The Council-run Eenhana Trade and Business Expo since 2008, and the Eenhana Annual Youth Festival, inaugurated in 2019. The Town Council is investing into marketing activities directed at investors and is assisting business development by developing open markets and providing business skills.

He then went to teach at Stanford and was a National Fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and a visiting professor at the University of Chicago before arriving at University College London. Currently he is also a Research Director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in London, co- director of the Centre for the Evaluation of Development Policies at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and a director of the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy. In 2004, Attanasio co-authored an IFS evaluation of an initiative which was designed to improve the lives of children in small Colombian towns and villages by paying their mothers to improve their children's food intake; in return, younger children had to have regular medical check-ups and older ones were required to attend school regularly. Begun in 2002, and funded by both the World Bank and the Inter- American Development Bank, the project had examined how funds to alleviate poverty and promote development should be targeted. Early results were positive, showing both an increase in the number of children going to school and those enjoying improved diets. Attanasio said, \\"This evaluation is important, not just for Colombia, but to help us understand how developing countries can best target valuable resources to improve the prospects for their poorest children.\\" In 2001 Attanasio was elected Fellow of the Econometric Society and in 2004 he was elected Fellow of the British Academy. He was chosen to be President of the European Economic Association in 2014. In October 2016, Attanasio won the 1 million Swiss francs Klaus J. Jacobs Research Prize for his \\"use of economic models and field experiments to assess and shape early child development programs and policies in low income countries\\". In 2016 Attanasio was also awarded the Carlos Diaz Alejandro prize by the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association and in 2017 he was elected to serve in 2020 as the 2nd vice-president of the Econometric Society.

It was created by the Soviet Union at Kotovsk, and named after the Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan.

General Lascăr commanded the division from April 12 to September 12, 1945. The division did not see combat in World War II. In late 1945 the division was reported to have been integrated into the Romanian 4th Army.

State – 78% Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 166 pupils, or 18% of the district's pupils, received Special education services. Among the identified students 54% had a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 170 pupils, or 18% of the district's pupils, received special education services. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Forest City Regional School District received a $465,420 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010–11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 1 student or 1.12% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Forest City Regional School District was $58,029 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $20,594 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $76,623.

Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In July 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district.

Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate – land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania public school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75–85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two or more counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011–12 – 35.7300 mills for Susquehanna County.

According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012–2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011–12 school year, the Forest City Regional School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Forest City Regional School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Forest City Regional School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009–10 or in 2010–11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Forest City Regional School District was $245 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 1,324 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 48% of property owners applied for tax relief in Susquehanna County. In Susquehanna County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was awarded to the approved property owners in Blue Ridge School District. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Enrollment Forest City Regional School District is experiencing low enrollment in K-12. The Pennsylvania Department of Education projects the district's enrollment will decline to 800 pupils through 2018. Shifting population trends across the U.S. and Pennsylvania are affecting school enrollment and may impact the building needs of school districts in the years to come. Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009. A study done by Standard and Poors in 2007 (at the request of the PA General Assembly) examined whether the consolidation of small school district's administrations would yield saving where the resulting district had 3000 pupils or less. Superintendent were asked about savings, if their district were to merge with another district at the administrative level only, but not close any of their schools. It found 42% of survey respondents thought consolidation could achieve cost reductions. Additionally, 63% of responding superintendents believed that consolidation with another district would help provide additional academic enrichment opportunities for the students. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. Extracurriculars The Forest City Regional School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policies. The sports programs are offered under the rules and guidelines of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home-Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching.

It is the last single to be released by the band in their original line-up. Recording \\"Reasons to be Cheerful\\" was not recorded at The Workhouse, Fulham with the material that made up the Do it Yourself album, but in Eretcia Studios (owned by RCA) in Rome during a break in a long European tour. According to its writer, Ian Dury, the song was inspired by a near-fatal accident involving a lighting roadie. Roadie Charley almost got electrocuted in Italy by a microphone stand while leaning over a mixing desk. Another roadie saved his life, hence 'no electric shocks' is included in the song's lyrics. The song was written in the band's hotel during the aftermath of this, and a fight that broke out at the venue when the band were forced to cancel the show because of the safety issues. Both it and the B-side \\"Common As Muck\\" were recorded in the break in the tour caused by the cancellation of the Italian shows. Saxophonist Davey Payne was upset about the financial disparities within Dury’s band, so in order to placate him, Dury told co-writer Chas Jankel to incorporate a sax solo part in the middle, which Payne could improvise and thus earn a share in the song. Composition The song has been described as a 'shopping-list song'. It is a simple list of a number of reasons to be cheerful. In that respect it is almost identical to an older Ian Dury track, \\"England's Glory\\", a song that he had refused to revive when asked the previous year. The list of reasons to be cheerful includes: * Rock 'n' Roll singer Buddy Holly * Little Richard's 1956 hit \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" * Hammersmith Palais, London * The Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, Russia * British automobile company Scammell Lorries (specifically their 18-wheeler truck) * Equal voting rights * Piccadilly Circus, London * Genitalia ('Fanny Smith and Willy') * Oatmeal breakfast cereal * Generosity and politeness * Yellow socks * Carrot juice * Wine (specifically claret) * Elvis (Presley) and Scotty (Moore), his guitarist * Going to the toilet ('sitting on the potty') * A cure for smallpox * The National Health Service's free prescription glasses * Male and female prostitutes ('Gigolos and Brasses') * Smoking a bong (lighting up the chalice) * Skiffle singer Wee Willie Harris * Steven Biko * Jamaican trombonist Rico Rodriguez, who would go on to play with Coventry band The Specials the same year as \\"Reasons to be Cheerful\\"'s release * The Marx Brothers ('Harpo, Groucho, Chico') * Popular British sandwich ('Cheddar cheese and pickle') * British motorcycle manufacturer Vincent Motorcycles (pronounced 'motorsickle' to rhyme with pickle and tickle) * Sex ('slap and tickle') * American comedian Woody Allen * Spanish painter Salvador Dalí * Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich * The elderly bachelor Don Pasquale in the opera of the same name by Gaetano Donizetti * The popular song Volare * Soul singer Smokey Robinson * Being released from prison ('Coming out of chokey') * Saying okey-dokey * Being naked ('Being in my nuddy') * Saxophonist John Coltrane, specifically his soprano saxophone playing. * Italian singer-songwriter Adriano Celentano * 1940s and 1950s film actor Bonar Colleano * Self-education (\\"something nice to study\\") The single's B-side, \\"Common as Muck\\", has a much more 'classic Dury' sound. An amusing number, written sometime before its A-side, it is a celebration of being 'common' working class). Like its A-side, it is filled with name checks, including Lionel Blair, Evonne Goolagong, Jack Palance and Fred Astaire. Re-releases and versions As with \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\" before it, \\"Reasons to be Cheerful\\" can now be found easily on every Ian Dury compilation to date. Like all of Ian Dury's singles, this was not originally the case because, in keeping with Ian Dury's singles policy at the time, the song was omitted from the next album (Laughter) and was not made available again. It first re-appeared on the compilation album Jukebox Dury two years later in 1981. Demon Records chose bizarrely to add \\"Reasons to Be Cheerful\\" as the sole bonus track to its CD re-issue of Laughter. This was an unusual choice considering it has no relation to the album, which was recorded by another line-up of the band including Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, and that the song was already included as a bonus track on their re- issue of Do It Yourself. Edsel Records has included both \\"Reasons to be Cheerful\\" and its extended mix on its 2-Disc edition of Do It Yourself. Versions For the 12\\" version of the single, a longer remixed version of the track was released, this was later included as a bonus track for both Demon and Edsel Records CD re-issues of the Do it Yourself album A live version of \\"Reasons to Cheerful\\" omitted from the original record, was added as a bonus track to the CD re-issue of Ian Dury and The Blockhead's Live Album Warts 'n' Audience it closes the band's set and features Ian Dury promising to make an album in the near future. As the finale to Charlie Brooker's 2014 Wipe, The Blockheads played an adaptation called \\"Reasons to be Fearful '14\\", with Brooker providing alternative lyrics relating to the events of 2014. The song provides the title for the 2016 musical Reasons to be Cheerful by the Graeae Theatre Company.https://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/news/graeaes-cult-hit- musical-run-just-few-performances-septemberjust-one-great-reasons-be-cheerful  Title  Similar to \\"Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll\\", \\"Reasons to be Cheerful\\" can be found spelt various ways, including on some official Ian Dury records.

Shankar had previously served as Agriculture & Fisheries Minister from 1969 to 1971. Shankar is a member of the large ethnic South Asian community in Suriname. He had studied at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. After his return to Suriname, he became active in the Progressive Reform Party. He supported independence in 1975. Career Shankar was elected as President by the National Assembly after a parliamentary election was held in November 1987. The ruling military regime had led the National Assembly to adopt a new constitution, which permitted coup leader Dési Bouterse to remain as head of the army. Ramsewak Shankar was a former agriculture minister and succeeded Ramdat Misier as the President of Suriname. The Shankar government initially gained the full support of the National Assembly. In 1989 the Treaty of Kourou, a ceasefire agreement between the Jungle Commando and the Surinamese army, was signed. Shankar agreed to pardon the Maroons who had been waging the civil war against the military in an effort to preserve their autonomy within their traditional territory in the rain forest. He discussed the possibility of their members keeping their arms in the interior. On April 1989, a general amnesty was passed for violence committed during the civil war, but not for human rights violations which had mainly been committed by the National Army. Dési Bouterse and the National Democratic Party opposed the agreement, calling it a violation of the constitution. Nevertheless the National Assembly approved the Kourou Agreement with a large majority. In December 1990 both Bouterse and Shankar were on an international trip, and made a stop over in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Bouterse was not allowed to leave the security area by the Dutch military police while Shankar could pass, and received full access to the gathered press. On 21 December, Bouterse attacked Shankar on his return in Suriname for failing to protest. The next day, Bouterse resigned from the Army. On 24 December a military coup known as the \\"telephone coup\\" ousted President Shankar, and Ivan Graanoogst was appointed as Acting President. On 29 December, Johan Kraag was chosen by the National Assembly as President of Suriname. On 30 December, Kraag asked Bouterse to return, who became Commander of the Army on 1 January 1991.

The school missed all metrics measured in both reading and mathematics. Additionally the school administration was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to develop a School Improvement Plan to address the school's low student achievement. Under the Pennsylvania Accountability System, the school district must pay for additional tutoring for struggling students. The High School is eligible for special, extra funding under School Improvement Grants which the school must apply for each year. *2011, Shikellamy High School declined to Corrective Action II first year status due to declining student achievement. It was revealed that a teacher had given copies of the PSSAs to students to practice for the exams. The principal was permitted to resign and the issue was reported to the state. Shikellamy HIgh School Administration was required to notify parents of the low academic achievement and to offer the opportunity to transfer to a better performing school within the district. No alternative school exists in the district. *2010 - Making Progress: in Corrective Action I status on student achievement. *2009 - declined to Corrective Action I status due to chronic, low student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Shikellamy High School Academic Achievement Report Card 2010, October 20, 2010 *2009 - declined to Corrective Action I.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Shikellamy High School AYP Overview 2009, September 2009 In 2009, Shikellamy High School ranked 464th out of 666 Pennsylvania high schools for the reading and mathematics achievement of its students and had its 80th bicentennial.Eleventh grade ranking in Pennsylvania, SchoolDigger.com.

Multiple explanations for the chronically low results were offered by the district's superintendent.Gessel, Damian, \\"School fails tests again\\", The Daily Item, August 31, 2007. In 2009, an inadequate number of Shikellamy High School students were on grade level for the fourth year in a row. Due to poor performance on state standards testing coupled with inadequate improvement over time, the high school was moved to Corrective Action 1 in 2009. The state has provided extensive resources to assist the school in improving its education program through a School Improvement Planning process as dictated by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Further interventions will be used to meet the needs of the students. Of Pennsylvania's 3115 public schools, 53 are in Corrective Action 1 and another 169 are in Corrective Action 2. In 2009, 468 of the state's 500 school districts met all Adequate Yearly Progress targets.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. Reading 11th grade *2012 - 59% on grade level. (22% below basic). State - 67%.

The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $27,922 for the program.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Fall Grants 2009-10, August 2009 By Pennsylvania law, this program is open to students, residing in the district who are home schooled or attend nonpublic schools.

The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. School district superintendents have the discretion to graduate up to 10% of pupils who do not pass the exams or project. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. Technology The district is connected to the Internet with 4 Mb of bandwidth, burstable to 10 Mb. We are connected from one building to the other with a fiber WAN. All buildings have a wired network. The secondary buildings also have a wireless network.

This provides parents with online information about their child's attendance and grades.Shikellamy School District administration, Technology in Shikellamy School District, 2010 Grants Shikellamy HIgh School did not participate in: 2013 Pennsylvania Safe Schools nor the Pennsylvania School Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The state grant requires the district hire a part- time technology coach, whose role is to assist the teachers in using the equipment and software effectively to improve their instruction. The salary is covered by the grant. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Shikellamy School District applied, but was denied funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district received $316,667. The district received $57,023 in 2008-09 for a total of $373,690. Among the public school districts in County the highest award was given to Shikellamy School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. =Project 720= Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth's high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Shikellamy School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $89,527 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.PA Office of the Budget, 2011-12 Budget General Fund - State Appropriations, June 28, 2011 Vo-Tech SUN Area Technical School is a regional vocational school, offering adult education classes, vocational education, and technical career training.

The Shikellamy School Board prohibits bullying by district students and employees. A policy approved in December 2008 defines bullying and cyberbullying - Policy 249. The board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. District administration are required to annually provide the following information with the district's Safe School Report: the board's bullying policy, a report of bullying incidents in the school district, and information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or education programs. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy Shikellamy School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy was in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity hat are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Pennsylvania Department of Education Division of Food and Nutrition, Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for its approval. The Shikellamy High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low- income families. All students attending the school can choose to eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Shikellamy School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the high school building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Beginning with the 2017-18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. The district also participated in Highmark Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013.PR Newswire, Highmark Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools Available Free Through 2009, 2007 Extracurriculars Shikellamy High School offers many extracurricular activities to its students.

In 2009 it was renamed to 'Tong Tong Fair'. Established in 1959 it is one of the oldest festivals and the fourth largest grand fair in the Netherlands. It is also the annual event with the highest number of paying visitors of the Dutch city of The Hague, having consistently attracted more than 100,000 visitors since 1993. The name ‘'Pasar Malam Besar’' is derived from the Indonesian/Malay language and literally means ‘Great Night Market’. The new name was chosen to emphasise its link with the 'Tong Tong Foundation' and its cultural mission. Another reason was to distinguish oneself from the many other fairs under the name pasar malam. Every summer the fair is raised on its dedicated fairground, called the ‘Malieveld’, close to the central train station of The Hague. 22.000 m² of festival terrain and many, mostly Indo, volunteers will facilitate visitors from both the Netherlands and abroad. The festival hosts three popular food courts, a culinary theatre, many large to medium stages for performance art, workshop areas, areas for lecture and interviews, market areas, as well as specific fair areas for trading merchandise. History In defiance of government pressure to assimilate into Dutch society, a group of outspoken and independent Indos, organized in the so-called ‘Indies Cultural Circle’, assembled around famous Indo intellectual Tjalie Robinson. One of their accomplishments was the founding of the Pasar Malam Besar in 1959. Its continued success in attracting visitors of all generations and presenting a diverse and progressive programme, while preserving the centuries-old cultural ties with the Indonesian Archipelago has gone beyond their expectations. In 2003 HM Queen Beatrix herself officially opened the 45th Pasar Malam Besar. The royal opening was repeated in 2008 for its 50th edition, which was the last time the name Pasar Malam Besar was used. Since the Indonesian National Revolution and the expulsion of all Dutch citizens from the Republic of Indonesia, the consequent fall out between the Netherlands and Indonesia has led to a long freeze of political, economical and even academic and cultural relations between the 2 nations. To a degree, this has lasted well into the 21st century. The Tong Tong Fair has always attempted to rekindle and foster those relations and since the 1970s consistently invited Indonesian artisans to the event. It was here that for instance the Royal princesses of Solo, daughters of Pakubuwono XII, performed the exclusive Serimpi dances in 1985. It was the first time in history that members of the Surakarta nobility performed these dances outside the Kraton (Royal Palace) of Solo. In 1985 the Tong Tong Fair also organised a benefit to help rebuild the Kraton of Solo, that was damaged by a fire. In 2006 the Tong Tong Fair organised a benefit to help Indonesian victims of the 2004 Tsunami. Programme =Music and dance= Third generation Indo artists from the Netherlands perform at, then, the Pasar Malam Besar, 2006. Two specific forms of Indo music usually take center stage. Kroncong (, ) which is an age old music form, with roots in Portuguese Fado music, that developed in Indo communities around Batavia (Now Jakarta). Classic Kroncong orchestras can still be found in both the Netherlands and Indonesia. The other typical music form is called Indorock.Live video footage - Indorock performance It combines flamboyant showmanship and musical virtuoso, based on the American Rock and Roll idiom and has been played by Indo bands ever since the early fifties. With the participation of 3rd and 4th generation Indos, also DJ’s, Hiphoppers and urban live bands are taking their brand of Indo music to the stage at the 'Tong Tong Fair' / ‘Pasar Malam Besar’. =Food and beverage= Indonesian food in the Eetwijk The multi faceted Indo cuisine (, ) is considered one of the first fusion kitchens in the world and is heavily based on the kitchens of many different Indonesian areas. The classic Rijsttafel (a Dutch word meaning \`Rice-table’) is a prime example of a Eurasian culinary concept that was not prevalent in pre-colonial Indonesia. The food courts present a wide range of traditional Indonesian and Asian dishes. The culinary theatre allows visitors to share and discuss recipes and make and taste dishes. The market stalls sell fresh Asian fruit such as durian or manggis and snacks such as martabak or pisang goreng. The abundance of food on offer attracts many visitors. =Merchandise and culture= Stand with Indonesian kitsch and culture A large section of the ‘Tong Tong Fair’ is reserved for amongst others Indonesian businesses selling their merchandise which includes antiques, Yogya or Bali silver, furniture, batiks, wood carvings and much more.Video report in Indonesian language. But next to the above-mentioned eye catchers the ‘Tong Tong Fair’ also offers workshops and master classes in the arts and lecture on amongst others literature, architecture and cultural research. Notable also are the comprehensive cultural delegations from specific areas in Indonesia that are invited to participate. Awards Dance group in 2014 The Tong Tong Fair, at that time still known as the Pasar Malam Besar, won the Promotion Award of The Hague in December 2006 in the category Tourism and Economy. This was followed in June 2007 by the prestigious Grand Prix of the National Events Awards (the ‘Oscars’ of the Dutch events industry). The Grand Prix is only awarded to events, which in terms of size, standing and allure, have become a real phenomenon.Previous winners of the Grand Prix include the International Film Festival Rotterdam and North Sea Jazz Festival. In 2008 the Tong Tong Foundation received the highest award of the city of the Hague (The Stadspenning by the municipality of The Hague). Challenges Dance group Kurung Kurung from Leiden Notwithstanding the great number of visitors the festival attracts to this day, the greatest challenge facing it is formulating a clear vision for the future and strong strategy towards achieving its cultural mission. As the most important exhibition of Indo culture it will need to transform beyond an event of nostalgia for the Dutch East Indies towards a dynamic catalyst facilitating the evolution of Indo identity and culture.Iburg, Nora “Van Pasar Malam tot I Love Indo, identiteitsconstructie en manifestatie door drie generaties Indische Nederlanders.” (Master thesis, Arnhem University, 2009, Ellessy Publishers, 2010) p.91-95 .Cohen, Matthew, Isaac \\"The Komedie Stamboel: popular theater in colonial Indonesia, 1891-1903.\\" (Publisher: Ohio University Press, 2006) P.368 See: Other modern challenges concern its potential online and multi-lingual role in social media as well as their ability to professionally register the many unique cultural activities and performances hosted.

He fled Germany in 1936. He immigrated to the United States in 1936 and studied German literature at University of California, Berkeley. After working as an art critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, in 1939 he became an \\"assistant to the director\\" at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. There, he helped to prepare an exhibition about the Mexican painter Diego Rivera.

It was a watercolour by Paul Klee, and he bought it from a Jewish refugee in need of money. While living in California, Berggruen was a student of the painter David Park. After the Second World War Berggruen returned to Europe as member of the U.S. Army and worked briefly on the American-sponsored paper Heute in Munich (located in the same building where the novelist Erich Kästner worked). He then moved to Paris, where he worked in the fine arts division of UNESCO, run by his former boss at the San Francisco museum, Grace Morley. Within a few years, he opened a small bookshop on the Île Saint-Louis, specializing in illustrated books and later lithographs. During this time he became acquainted with Tristan Tzara, who introduced him to Pablo Picasso in Paris. He soon became an important dealer in Picasso prints, as well as in second-hand Picasso paintings. His renowned art collection, which he valued at $450 million in 2001, included 165 works by 20th-century masters such as Braque, Matisse, Klee, and Giacometti, with a unique group of 85 works by Picasso.Germany Buys Berggruen Works In 1977, Berggruen published Douglas Cooper's catalogue raisonné of Juan Gris. He finally resigned as director of the Paris gallery in 1980 in order to devote himself to collecting and dealing. In 1988, he donated 90 Klee works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, although he later expressed fear that his donation would go unnoticed in the museum's own vast collections. That same year, he exhibited his collection at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire in Geneva. In 1990, he lent a good part of his collection to the National Gallery in London, where he exhibited works—including Seurat's landmark painting Les Poseuses (1886)—until 2001. In 1995, the German government lent him an apartment in Berlin and gave him an art museum opposite the Charlottenburg Palace. The collection, then comprising 118 works, opened to the public in 1997. At the time, then German culture minister Ulrich Roloff-Momin described it as \\"the most meaningful art transfer in Berlin's post-war history.\\" In 2000, he finally sold the art collection to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation: the collection of 165 works (including 85 Picassos), which Berggruen valued at €750m, was purchased by the PCHF at about a quarter of that value.\\"Heinz Berggruen, 93; collector of 20th century art\\" Los Angeles Times.

They are popular in the United Kingdom,Old English pies and puddings Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Europe, New Zealand, Canada, Zimbabwe and South Africa. History Meat pie is found in the Neolithic Period, around 9500 BC. The ancient Egyptians' diet featured basic pies made from oat, wheat, rye, and barley, and filled with honey and baked over hot coals.\\"Pies, History of Pies.\\" What's Cooking America. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Mar. 2011. The Greeks used a flour-water paste resembling pie pastry, and filled it with meat. These pies were usually fried or cooked under coals. The Romans adopted them, using a variety of meats, oysters, mussels, lampreys, and fish as filling and a mixture of flour, oil, and water for the crust. This 'pastry' cover was not meant to be eaten and was thrown away. In Northern Europe, cooks created the pastry using fats like lard and butter to make stiff dough to hold an upright pie.\\"A Brief History of Pie - TIME.\\" Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Mar. 2011. These medieval pastry dishes were called \\"coffins/coffyns\\", which means a basket or box. According to Janet Clarkson in Pie: A Global History, the \\"coffins\\" were: :savory meat pies with the crusts or pastry being tall, straight-sided with sealed-on floors and lids. Open- crust pastry (not tops or lids) were known as \\"traps.\\" These pies held assorted meats and sauce components and were baked more like a modern casserole with no pan (the crust itself was the pan, its pastry tough and inedible). These crusts were often made several inches thick to withstand many hours of baking. Some historians suggest the tough, almost inedible, crust was given to the servants while the lords and ladies of the house ate the contents. This pastry became a common dish in medieval times, and by the 14th century, came to be called a \\"pye\\" or \\"pie\\". The etymology of the word is unknown, but may be related to the magpie (also called \\"pie\\"), perhaps because both were spotted, or because the bird collects miscellaneous articles.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, s.v. The French and Italians specialized in redefining the pastry of the pie, making it flakier and tastier by new methods of adding butter, rolling, and folding the dough. In 1440, the Paris pastry guild was recognized and started to expand their product—and so something like the modern day crust began to be used. Missionaries and explorers spread the meat-based pie dish across the globe. The English Pilgrims of the North American colonies brought the recipes across the ocean with them. The crust of the pie was useful to preserve food during the long winter months in America (just as the pies were used in antiquity). But the pie was not considered popular there until the 1800s, and today in America meat pies have lost their popularity to be replaced with sweet pies.\\"A Brief History of Pie - TIME.\\" Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com.

Latin American meat empanadas may be pies or more often pasties; different pastry shells and fillings are used, and they may be baked or fried. Empanadas usually contain much onion and green or red pepper, in combination with meat or fish. Empanada dough takes many forms, from those made with cornmeal to puff pastry. Ground beef with olives, fried egg, pulled pork, diced steak, even cheese and salami are used in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Puerto Rico and Peru for example.

Designing with Light. McGraw-Hill: New York, NY 2008. p 223. The instruments are organized by their position on-stage, and is the distinguishing characteristic between an instrument schedule and a channel hookup or similar paperwork. The instrument schedule includes all information about every instrument, including hanging location, instrument number, type, wattage, color, focus area, circuit, dimmer and templates, along with any additional information. The variety of information included in an instrument schedule generally makes this more \\"complete\\" than other generated paperwork, and as such the schedule is often considered the \\"master\\" sheet. The master electrician uses the information contained in the instrument schedule along with the light plot to direct the hanging of the instruments. TOC  Conventions  Typically the instrument schedule is organized first by hanging location. Common hanging locations (or lighting positions) in theater include electrics, apron pipes, front of house positions, booms and ladders. Within each position, instruments are numbered in the order they are located on the pipe. The standard practice is to label instruments from stage left to right (for battens, and top to bottom for booms and ladders,Gillette, Michael. Designing with Light. McGraw-Hill: New York, NY 2008. p 230. although some lighting designers choose to label from stage right to stage left. This is a matter of personal preference; it is only important that numbering is consistent. This instrument number (or unit number) is used to sort the instruments in each lighting position on the instrument schedule.  Software  While instrument schedules have traditionally been made by hand or on spreadsheets, there are now several industry specific software based means to generate them. Lightwright is a spreadsheet program that will print nicely formatted instrument schedules. CAD software such as VectorWorks and AutoCAD used for creating a light plot can often export lighting information into forms that other programs can use. This way the lighting designer only needs to draft the light plot and the instrument schedule and other paperwork can be generated automatically. Some designers use Microsoft Word.

The inn was built in 1810, and is one of the oldest operating traveler's accommodations in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is well known for its use in exterior shots of the Newhart television series. Description The Waybury Inn is located on the north side of East Main Street (Vermont Route 125), near the eastern end of East Middlebury village. It is set near the westernmost end of one of the major routes across the Green Mountains in central Vermont. It consists of a 2-1/2 story gable-roofed main block, from which a two-story block extends to the rear. A single-story porch, covered by a hip roof, extends across the front and around to one side. The interior is arranged in a central hall plan, with large rooms, extending the full depth of the main block, on either side of the main staircase. with History The inn was built in 1810 by John Foot (or Foote). The pass to the east had opened as a toll road (turnpike) in 1808, and Foot sought to capitalize on the traffic it would bring. However, the turnpike never brought a high volume of traffic, and efforts to develop a glassworks in the village also cramped growth in the area. Moderate growth in the village by 1850 prompted its second proprietor, Royal Farr, to expand the premises in 1867 by adding the ell to the rear. This included a ballroom, and Farr added other amenities to make the inn a local site for social events. The inn was variously known as the Glen House and Green Mountain House before being given its present name in the 20th century. The only period of time in which the inn was closed was during World War II. The inn maintains a tradition in which, in room 9, there is an antique desk with a secret drawer. Following the lead of a couple who found the drawer in 1987, guests often put notes in the drawer. The Waybury Inn was also used as a location for exterior shots on the Bob Newhart television series, Newhart, from 1982 to 1990. Featured as the Stratford Inn, the Waybury Inn was painted white for the show. After the show went off the air in 1990, the inn was repainted green to match the nearby Green Mountains.

It was the former family seat of the Saunderson family, and is now in ruins. The Castle Saunderson International Scouting Centre is a Scouting Ireland facility, opened in 2012 within the grounds of the castle. The centre provides indoor accommodation and campsites covering . It is open to Scouts year round, as well as to non-Scouts for most of the year. It currently acts as a World Scouting Centre for the Scouts, alongside Cairo International Scout Centre in Egypt and others.  History  =Family home= The Saunderson family acquired the original castle during the Plantation of Ulster. The original castle was inhabited by the O'Reillys of Breffni and was formerly known as Breffni Castle from the 14th century. Robert Sanderson, who fought on the side of William of Orange, inherited the castle from his father in 1676. James II's troops burned the castle in 1689. Months later, 400 of King James's soldiers were ambushed here while on retreat from the battle at Newtownbutler. They were driven toward the Finn River and many drowned.Information sign outside the caste, 2018 The present castle dates to 1840 and was destroyed by fire in 1990. A notable member of the family born there was Colonel Edward James Saunderson, a founder of the Ulster Unionist Party. Major Frederick John Sandys Lindesay of Loughry and Tullyhogue died there while a guest in 1877. The Hon. Barry Maxwell, eldest son and heir apparent of The 10th Baron Farnham, died in a cycling accident on the estate in 1879. The last Saunderson who owned the castle was Edward's grandson, Captain Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Saunderson. He was a prisoner of war during the Second World War and was later present at the War Tribunal at Nuremberg as the legal advisor to Lord Justice Lawrence. He sold the property to a businessman in 1977. He had planned to use it as a residence, but this never transpired. It later served as a hotel, but was damaged by fire, the third fire to occur at the castle. The Castle Saunderson Demesne, currently only , has entrances in County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland. The demesne includes a church with crypt and family graveyard. =International Scout Centre= In 1997 the castle and its grounds were acquired by Scouting Ireland (CSI). The subsequent formation of Scouting Ireland, and financial difficulties, delayed its development, and put the campsite project in doubt. With support from the American Ireland Fund and Cavan County Council, substantial progress occurred, with the announcement in November 2008 of EU funding for the project, amounting to over €3 million. His Excellency Michael D. Higgins, President of Ireland, opened the €3.7 million European-funded Castle Saunderson International Scouting Centre in County Cavan on 18 August 2012. The President was joined by dignitaries from both sides of the Border, including Northern Ireland Executive Ministers Jonathan Bell, Nelson McCausland and Jennifer McCann, and Minister of State in the Republic, Fergus O’Dowd. In February 2015, Minister Heather Humphreys announced the approval of the restoration by Waterways Ireland of a canal, part of the Ulster Canal, connecting the site to the Erne basin. The site delivers programmes which complement the Messenger of Peace Award. The first camp chief of Castle Saunderson is local Fermanagh Scouter Tony Smith.

Bessone also played hockey for Association Saint-Dominique, a Lewiston amateur team. During his days in Maine, he was described as cocky but one of the best defensemen in high school hockey. Bessone was graduated from Kents Hill in 1939. =College= After prep school, he played college hockey from 1940–43 at the University of Illinois under legendary coach Vic Heyliger. He was team captain his senior season of 1942–43. In addition to hockey, Bessone earned letters in baseball and basketball. =Professional= Following Illinois, Bessone played minor league hockey in the AHL for the Providence Reds. He made his professional debut with the Reds on March 16, 1943, in the first game of the opening round of the AHL playoffs against the Cleveland Barons. His career in the AHL was cut short by serving in World War II. Bessone also played for his hometown Springfield minor league baseball team of the Eastern League. Coaching career =Westfield= Bessone was head ice hockey coach for Westfield High School for three seasons following his playing career. =Michigan Tech= Bessone got his first collegiate head coaching job on September 13, 1948, when he was hired by Michigan College of Mines and Technology (now Michigan Technological University). He coached at Michigan Tech for three seasons compiling a record of 20–31–2. =Michigan State= Following the 1951 season, Bessone accepted the head coaching position at Michigan State University after Harold Paulsen resigned. Bessone would remain at MSU for the next 28 years. When Bessone arrived at Michigan State, the ice hockey program was just beginning its third season and its youth was evident with a 6–25 record over two seasons. The Spartans struggled with six losing seasons before Bessone turned things around in his seventh season as coach. In 1957–58, Michigan State enjoyed its first winning season. The following season, Bessone guided MSU to a Big Ten championship and a berth in the NCAA tournament. The Spartans lost the 1959 national championship game in overtime to North Dakota. Following 1959, Michigan State became a charter member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), which was a reincarnation of the loosely affiliated Midwest Collegiate Hockey League and Western Intercollegiate Hockey League that disbanded following the 1957–58 season. Bessone and MSU struggled during the first five seasons of the WCHA. Again, Bessone turned things around with a winning season in 1964–65. The following season, Bessone coached Michigan State to an improbable NCAA National Championship. MSU began the 1965–66 season 4–10, but rebounded winning 12 of their last 15 games including both WCHA playoff games which earned MSU a spot in the NCAA tournament. In the national semifinals, Bessone squeaked out a 2–1 victory over highly favored Boston University. In the national championship game, Bessone and the Spartans faced Len Ceglarski's Clarkson team that owned the national-best record of 24–2. Michigan State shocked Clarkson with a dominant 6–1 victory sealing MSU's first national championship. Len Ceglarski and Bessone shared the Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year in 1966. The national title and coaching award cemented Bessone's legacy as a coach. To this day, Bessone's 1966 Michigan State team remains one of the biggest underdog stories in NCAA ice hockey history. The total number of team victories (16) and team winning percentage (.551) is the lowest of any NCAA ice hockey champion. MSU made the NCAA tournament again with a strong WCHA playoff finish in 1967, but lost in the national semifinals. Bessone began the 1970s with six straight winning seasons. As MSU hockey was building momentum, the 7,000-seat Munn Ice Arena was opened in 1974 just south of the old ice rink, Dem Hall. The peak of the momentum came in 1975–76 when Bessone guided MSU to its best WCHA conference finish. Michigan State was on the verge of earning an NCAA tournament berth when Minnesota knocked MSU out of the WCHA playoffs in triple overtime. Minnesota, who had finished below Michigan State in the conference, received an NCAA tournament bid instead. The loss proved devastating to Bessone and the MSU hockey program. The Spartans suffered three straight losing seasons following 1976. Bessone announced his retirement effective at the end of the 1978–79 season. He finished his coaching career with a 5–3 victory over archrival Michigan completing the weekend series sweep of the Wolverines. His success at Michigan State helped form a loyal group of MSU hockey supporters dubbed \\"Amo's Army.\\" Bessone holds a 387–458–22 career record in 31 seasons. Legacy Bessone's legacy extends beyond his accomplishments at Michigan State. Bessone helped establish the Greater Lansing Area Hockey Association (GLAHA), the first organized youth hockey program in Mid-Michigan. He assisted the league by donating used equipment and encouraging his players to volunteer as coaches. GLAHA started with three players in 1953 and by Bessone's retirement from coaching in 1979, the organization boasted 450 players. GLAHA alumni include current and former NHL players: Jeff Brubaker, Danton Cole, Kelly Miller, Kevin Miller, Kip Miller, Ryan Miller and Alfie Turcotte. For his efforts in establishing GLAHA, Bessone received the first John MacInnes Award in 1983. The award, given out by the American Hockey Coaches Association, recognizes great concern for amateur hockey and youth programs. In 1992, Bessone was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame. Bessone is also the namesake of numerous awards including: * The Amo Bessone Award (Springfield, Massachusetts) given to the top high school player in Western Massachusetts. The award is celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007. * Amo Bessone Award (Lansing, Michigan) given to the GLAHA coach of the year. * Amo Bessone Award (Michigan State University) presented to an MSU hockey player for outstanding athletic, scholastic and community participation achievements. Personal Bessone was married to Mary Kennedy Bessone. They had one son, John, who wrote for Sports Illustrated and was an associate television director for ABC Sports. His older brother, Pete, played six games for the Detroit Red Wings in 1937–38. Pete had a successful career as a player in the AHL and is a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Bessone retired first to Englewood, Florida, with his brother Pete Bessone, then later to Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his son John Bessone. His final visit to the Michigan State campus was October 2006 for a reunion of the 1966 and 1986 NCAA national championship teams.

It was formally active until mid-1954 and informally active (without government funding) until Smith's death in 1962. Smith eventually concluded that UFOs were probably extraterrestrial in origin and likely operated by manipulation of magnetism. History Smith made a request to use the facilities of the Department of Transport to study UFOs. The project was formally approved on December 2, 1950 with the intention to collect data about UFOs and apply any recovered data to practical engineering and technology. The ultimate goal of the project was to apply any findings on the subject of geomagnetism to the possibility of exploiting Earth's magnetic field as a source of propulsion for vehicles. Smith and his colleagues in government believed that UFOs, if real, might hold the key to this new source of power. A small-scale undertaking, the project used DOT facilities, with some assistance from personnel at the Defence Research Board (DRB) and the National Research Council. In June 1952 Smith issued a preliminary report arguing that UFOs likely came from intelligent, extraterrestrial sources and almost certainly manipulated magnetism for flight. A 1953 report reiterated these conclusions. Also in April 1952 the Canadian government established Project Second Storey, a parallel UFO research project, with Smith also involved. It consisted of a group of scientists and military officers who met periodically to consider the UFO question and to recommend government action. Smith reported to Second Storey on some of Project Magnet's findings and conclusions. Smith believed UFOs were linked to psychic phenomena and believed himself to be in contact with extraterrestrial beings who communicated to him through telepathy. Smith wrote a number of articles for Topside, the publication of the Ottawa New Sciences Club which he founded, outlining the philosophy of the \\"Space Brothers\\" with whom he claimed to be in contact. The articles were later collected and published posthumously in 1969 under the title The Boys from Topside. =Shirley's Bay= In October 1952, Smith set up an observatory at Shirley's Bay outside Ottawa to study reports of UFO sightings, believing that UFOs would emit physical characteristics that could be measured. A number of sighting reports were investigated by Project Magnet but in 1954 the project was shut down. Smith was allowed to use the Shirley's Bay facilities with his own funding and did so until his death in 1962.

Born in Paris, he was the brother of the prolific and inventive designer-engraver Jean Lepautre. Antoine Lepautre has been called \\" \\"one of the most inventive architects of the early years of Louis XIV's reign\\".Stéphane Loire, reviewing Maxime Préaud's Antoine Lepautre, Jacques Lepautre et Jean Lepautre, in The Burlington Magazine 138 No. 1116 (March 1996), p. 198. He was a protégé of Cardinal Mazarin, to whom he dedicated his Desseins de plusieurs palais (Paris, 1652/3), in which his imagination is given free rein. In 1646–1648, Lepautre built a chapel for the Jansenist Convent of Port-Royal at Paris. His Hôtel de Beauvais (1655–1660), rue François-Miron, built for Pierre de Beauvais and his wife Catherine Henriette Bellier, première dame de chambre to Anne of Austria, brought Lepautre celebrity for the ingenious way he made use of a highly irregular parcel of land, ranging his structure round an oval court. The Hôtel de Beauvais's architectural qualities were noted by Bernini during his Paris sojourn, and it remains Lepautre's outstanding surviving monument. The design and construction of the Château du Vaudreuil (Eure) in 1658–1660 has been attributed to Lepautre, but Robert W. Berger, the author of a monograph on the architect, considers this attribution to be doubtful.Berger 1969, pp. 97–98. In 1660 Lepautre was appointed house architectcontrôleur général of the bâtiments de Monsieur to Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, the brother of Louis XIV. In this quality he built the wings for the lost Château de Saint-Cloud and constructed the celebrated Grand Cascade that survives in its park. Drawings conserved in the Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm, demonstrate that Lepautre was the designer of stables for Jean-Baptiste Colbert at the Château de Sceaux, in the early 1670s. Madame de Montespan commissioned him to make plans for her Château de Clagny, close to Versailles; the unfinished project was completed after Lepautre's death by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. For Antoine Nompar de Caumont, duc de Lauzun, Lepautre built the Hôtel de Lauzun at Saint- Germain-en-Laye. In 1671, he became one of the first eight members of the Académie royale d'architecture created by Louis XIV. The monograph in English is Robert W.
