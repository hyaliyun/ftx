Portrayed by Christopher Judge, Teal'c is a Jaffa warrior from the planet Chulak. As a Jaffa, Teal'c is a genetically modified human with an abdominal pouch that serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity; Teal'c is around 100 years old during the show's run and ages an additional 50 years in the final SG-1 episode. Teal'c's most notable feature is a golden tattoo found on his forehead, a sign that he once served the System Lord Apophis as First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank. Teal'c is introduced in the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1, \\"Children of the Gods\\". The character appears in all episodes of SG-1 except season 8's \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", making him the character with the most episode appearances. Teal'c also appears in the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum, as well as the Stargate Atlantis season 4 episodes \\"Reunion\\" and \\"Midway\\". In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series\\". Role in Stargate =Character arc= Teal'c is a Jaffa from the planet Chulak. In the decades before the events of Stargate SG-1, the Goa'uld System Lord Cronus executed Teal'c's father (Cronus' First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank) for retreating during a battle that could not be won. In the hopes of avenging his father's death one day, Teal'c joined the armies of the rival System Lord Apophis. Under the direction of Apophis' then-First Prime, Bra'tac, Teal'c learned the ways of a warrior and rose in the ranks to become Apophis's new First Prime. His interaction with Bra'tac and his own personal experiences eventually led Teal'c to doubt the divinity of the Goa'uld. When the SG-1 team is captured on Chulak in the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1, Teal'c defects from Apophis and joins the SG-1 team. He believes this will provide an opportunity eventually to defeat the Goa'uld and bring freedom to all Jaffa.\\"Children of the Gods\\" Teal'c finds a home at Stargate Command (SGC) on Earth and occasionally visits his wife Drey'auc and his young son Rya'c on Chulak (see section Relationships). SG-1 joins forces with Bra'tac in many missions against Apophis in the next four seasons. Teal'c's integrity in the team is tested after he kills Daniel's wife Sha're in season 3's \\"Forever in a Day\\" to stop her torturing Daniel. After SG-1 succeeds in killing Apophis in the season 5 premiere, \\"Enemies\\", Chulak becomes a free planet. The first major group of Jaffa Resistance warriors is shown in season 5's \\"The Warrior\\". By season six, Teal'c and Bra'tac have become prominent leaders of the Jaffa Resistance. Earth's Alpha site serves as a main site of operation for the Rebel Jaffa and later the Tok'ra, but the two races have difficulty with trust and collaboration in defeating the Goa'uld as their enemy.\\"Death Knell\\" Teal'c and Bra'tac lose their symbiotes after a sabotaged Rebel Jaffa summit in season 6's \\"The Changeling\\", but the Tok'ra drug Tretonin sustains them from then on. Tretonin eventually becomes instrumental in liberating Jaffa from physiological reliance on Goa'uld symbiotes. No longer presenting a security risk to Earth, Teal'c attempts to have a normal life and moves out of the SGC in season 8's \\"Affinity\\". However, Teal'c's alien behavior and a murder case make life difficult for him. Teal'c and Bra'tac eventually lead the Jaffa to victory over the Goa'uld in season 8's \\"Reckoning\\"/\\"Threads\\". The Goa'uld have long weakened one another by continuous civil war amongst the System Lords, and the Jaffa see the Goa'uld's inability to save themselves from the Replicators as proof that they are false Gods. The new Jaffa Nation immediately becomes a major power, inheriting part of the fleets of the System Lords. Teal'c and Bra'tac are knighted Bloodkin to all Jaffa, the highest honour that can be bestowed on any Jaffa. The planet Dakara serves as the nation's new capital, and Chulak becomes a major stronghold for the Free Jaffa Nation in season 9. Teal'c is chosen as a member of the new Jaffa High Council, but the nation is divided between the opposition progressives (including Teal'c and Bra'tac) with a vision of a representative democracy, and the ruling traditionalists who support the military oligarchy. Many of the councilors are the former leaders of the Jaffa Resistance, and initially resist the Ori religion after having worshiped false gods for too long. After the death of the traditionalist leader Gerak in season 9's \\"The Fourth Horseman\\", Teal'c supports Bra'tac as an interim leader before the nation adopts a constitution based on Earth representative democracies in \\"Stronghold\\". After the events of season 9's \\"Camelot\\", the Ori take control of Chulak. The Jaffa suffer greatly against the Ori forces, and Dakara is completely destroyed. The last Jaffa episode is season 10's \\"Talion\\", in which Teal'c kills the Jaffa leader of an Ori-devout group named Arkad. The fate of the Jaffa Nation and Teal'c's standing among the Jaffa remain unresolved at the end of the series. In the series finale, \\"Unending\\", Teal'c spends fifty years frozen in time on the Odyssey with the rest of SG-1 when Carter triggers a time dilation device to prevent them being destroyed by an Ori battlecruiser, but when she finds a way to escape and save the Odyssey that requires one person to go back to the moment before time froze, Teal'c volunteers as his Jaffa nature meant that aging fifty years wouldn't be as significant to him as it would be to his human colleagues. As a result, Teal'c is the only one who remembers what took place during the time dilation device, but he vowed to never share that information with others, and apart from having gained a white streak in his hair his physical potential remains relatively unaffected. Teal'c appears in the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum. He also appears in two episodes of Stargate Atlantis, set before the events of Continuum. In \\"Reunion\\", he wishes Colonel Carter farewell before she leaves to become the new leader of Atlantis. In \\"Midway\\", he comes to Atlantis at Carter's request to teach Satedan warrior Ronon Dex how to deal with IOA interviews. While there, they develop a friendly rivalry, culminating in an hour-long sparring match which ended in a draw. When the Wraith leave the Pegasus galaxy and set foot at the SGC, Teal'c and Ronon work together to stop the enemy. =Characterization= Teal'c is a Jaffa from the planet Chulak, a planet orbiting a binary star system. Jaffa have a human appearance but have an abdominal pouch which serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity. Teal'c states he is 101 years old in season 4's \\"The Light\\", and ages an additional 50 years in season 10's \\"Unending\\". But since the symbiote also replaces the Jaffa's immune system, its removal is known to cause a long and painful death. As a Jaffa, Teal'c does not require sleep, but must engage in a form of meditation called kel'no'reem in order to synchronize with his symbiote. However, he later had his symbiote removed and survived on a drug called tretonin. After this, he was weaker, could not perform kel'no'reem and needed sleep. Teal'c is a \\"stalwart alien with the unfathomable - and mostly silent - demeanor\\" and \\"the most straight-faced member of SG-1\\". Teal'c's catchphrase is \\"Indeed\\". Christopher Judge described Teal'c as a liberator who tries to end his people's enslavement. Although Teal'c has certain advanced physical abilities and powers, he is very much human in his heart and in his mind. Judge also described Teal'c as a \\"rebel in a society that doesn't tolerate rebels\\". Teal'c is all about honor. By season 7, Teal'c has become more vocal about expressing his feelings towards situations and other characters. Teal'c became more accustomed to life on Earth, developed a taste for doughnuts and has gone on fishing trips with O'Neill, though he is puzzled as to why O'Neill fishes in a lake known to be devoid of fish. His favorite movie is Star Wars; he has seen it 9 times as of the season 5 episode Ascension. He once stated a dislike for \\"bovine lactose\\",Season 6, Episode 19 \\"The Changeling which may be due to an earlier episode (\\"Unnatural Selection\\"), in which Teal'c is seen gorging himself on ice cream and even stealing O'Neill's pint of ice cream from his hand when the Asgard beamed the refrigerated stores onto the Prometheus, implying that Teal'c may be lactose intolerant. In season 8, Judge wanted to take Teal'c one step closer to being more aware of Earth customs with a more Earth-like behavior, without him losing his alien perspective. He considered the first half of season 8 \\"the most my character has been given to do since we first started work on the series\\". =Relationships= At the beginning of the series, Teal'c is married to Drey'auc and has a son, Rya'c. When Teal'c defects to Earth, he leaves them behind on his homeworld, Chulak. Teal'c briefly reunites with his family in season 1's \\"Bloodlines\\" and season 2's \\"Family\\" to prevent Goa'uld influence on their life. Drey'auc marries Teal'c's childhood friend, Frotak, but Rya'c and Drey'auc leave Chulak to live in the Land of Light (from season 1's \\"The Broca Divide\\") soon after Frotak's death in \\"Family\\". Teal'c rekindles his feelings with a Tuk'ac temple priestess named Shau'nac in season 4's \\"Crossroads\\", but she is murdered soon thereafter. Drey'auc dies in a rebel Jaffa camp in season 6's \\"Redemption\\" after refusing a new larval symbiote. Teal'c begins a relationship with the Hak'tyl leader Ishta in season 7's \\"Birthright\\". He continues this relationship until at least season 8's \\"Sacrifices\\", where Rya'c also marries Kar'yn, a student of Ishta. Teal'c would also have a brief relationship with his neighbor, Krista. O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general except of Teal'c. At the beginning of the series, Hammond does not accept Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. General Landry also respects Teal'c as a warrior. The writers at first wanted to establish animosity between Teal'c and Daniel, particularly since Teal'c is indirectly responsible for the abduction of Daniel's wife Sha're, who was subsequent selected as a host for the Goa'uld Amaunet by Teal'c's then-master Apophis. \\"Forever in a Day\\" almost tries to flesh out this animosity. Judge and Michael Shanks, in real life best friends, protested, as they thought that Daniel would be fascinated by Teal'c's background, and Teal'c would be quite respectful to humans who have similar nobility despite behaving in a different manner. The producers eventually allowed the actors to show how much their characters care about and respect each other, although the characters may not get on with one another. For most of the run of SG-1, Teal'c is the only SG-1 member who is not from Earth. With the introduction of the human alien Jonas Quinn in season 6, the writers developed a relationship between the two aliens of the team \\"without making it seem exclusionary\\", and Teal'c is no longer the \\"Other\\" of the show. Teal'c and Jonas end up bonding because they have similar backgrounds. Christopher Judge explained that his character's amusement with Vala in seasons 9 and 10 contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. When Cameron Mitchell is introduced in season 9, Teal'c first reacts taken aback to Mitchell's enthusiasm, being more used to O'Neill's reserved attitude. Teal'c is unsure if he likes Mitchell at first, but Mitchell forces Teal'c to interact with him. By not letting Teal'c step back and observe, Mitchell makes Teal'c an active part of the scene. Teal'c and Mitchell are both warriors and leaders, but as Teal'c was established as a powerful warrior, the producers eventually established that Mitchell gets beat up all the time in fights. Conceptual history Christopher Judge had worked with Richard Dean Anderson before. Judge starred in a fifth season episode of MacGyver in 1990, where he played a high school student whom MacGyver tries to mentor and motivate despite negative influences. When the producers conceptualized Teal'c, they were unsure what they wanted, but had not met anyone who was definitely Teal'c for them. They were looking for African-American actors, and Judge was one of the last actors to read for the role. Judge was hired because the producers liked what he brought into the audition. They were receptive to Judge's input and gave him the freedom to change his lines from the beginning. Judge sat down with the producers at the beginning of each season and discussed what Teal'c should go through and what would slowly make him more human. During the first season, Teal'c seemed less well-integrated into the team than for instance O'Neill and Daniel. He was the only character who did not benefit as much from the more personal stories in season 3 and seemed to stagnate. Rumors began to surface at the end of season 3 that Judge would leave the show, but they were quickly and firmly denied. The last episodes of season 3 featured Teal'c in a more prominent role, and he benefited from additional screen time and storylines in season 4. Judge received his first story credit for the season 5 episode \\"The Warrior\\", and later wrote \\"The Changeling\\" on his own, focusing on Teal'c's self-identity. He later penned the season 7 episode \\"Birthright\\" and the season 8 episode \\"Sacrifices\\", both dealing with the Jaffa Hak'tyl faction and Teal'c's new love interest Ishta. =Make-up and hair= Since Teal'c wears a lot of make-up, Judge had to be on-set much earlier than the rest of the cast. The producers' original idea for Teal'c included long ears and a specific beard piece, but the make-up department got it down to just a forehead symbol, an Egyptian look, and the character's gold skin tone. The make-up was reflective of the Goa'uld Ra from the Stargate feature film. In the beginning of SG-1, Teal'c's forehead symbol consisted of three parts, and it took about an hour to apply the parts to Judge's forehead. The process was simplified over the years. The season 6 episodes \\"The Changeling\\" shows Teal'c experiencing an extended hallucination of being a human on Earth. For the filming of this episode, the eye make-up and the gold paint on the character was significantly toned down. With the beginning of season 7, when Teal'c no longer had a Goa'uld symbiote in his pouch, the gold make-up was dropped. Playing a bald-shaven head Teal'c for the first seven seasons, Judge usually let his hair grow during the show's hiatus, and shaved his head the morning of his first day back at work. For the season four premiere \\"Small Victories\\", he returned to the set with a small blond chin beard after the hiatus, as the producers had not allowed his character to have scalp hair at the time. Several episodes later, Judge shaved off the beard after acknowledging how it looked. With the beginning of season 8, after \\"many years of begging, pleading and politicking\\", Judge approached the producers again and asked for his character to have hair, and they gave in. Brad Wright was convinced that the audience would hate it. Judge showed the cornrows hairstyle that he thought Teal'c would have, at a convention, but the hair was cut short before the shooting of season 8 began. The story reasons for Teal'c's hair are never explained in the series, even despite Jack O'Neill making such an inquiry in \\"New Order\\", as he says, \\"What's with the hair?\\". Reception In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series\\".

It generally comprises four movements, typically a largo prelude followed by a fugal allegro, an expressive slow movement, and an allegro finale, although there are also many variations of this pattern.Grove Music Online: Sonata da chiesa, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.26196 During the 17th century, church services were increasingly accompanied by music for ensembles rather than solo organ, with canzonas and sonatas regularly substituted for the Proper during Mass and Vespers.Grove Music Online: Sonata da chiesa, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.26196 Many of these works, however, were not written explicitly as liturgical music and were often performed as concert pieces for entertainment. The term sonata da chiesa was originally used in its literal meaning of ‚Äúchurch music‚Äù but later came to be used figuratively to contrast this genre of composition with the sonata da camera, which literally meant ‚Äúchamber music‚Äù but generally comprised a suite of dances. Apel, Willi, with Thomas Binkley, ed., Italian Violin Music of the Seventeenth Century, p. 9, Indiana University Press, 1990 The exemplary works in this form are by Arcangelo Corelli whose Op. 1 (1681) and Op. 3 (1689) each consist of 12 trio sonatas with alternating slow-fast-slow-fast movements (the first 8 of the Concerti grossi, op.6 follow this pattern as well). This four movement scheme is followed in J. S. Bach's three sonatas for unaccompanied violin and in the first five sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord.Violin Sonatas (CD 19‚Äì20): \\"Liner notes\\" by Clemens Romijn p. 13, and \\"Full tracklist\\" pp. 155‚Äì56 in J. S. Bach Complete Edition: Liner notes, sung texts, full tracklist. Brilliant Classics, August 2014 (re-release). After 1700, composers tended to merge the sonata da cheisa with the sonata da camera. By the mid-18th century, however, this style of music was increasingly out of date, although Joseph Haydn, for example, did compose a few early symphonies that followed the largo‚Äìallegro‚Äìminuet‚Äìallegro pattern.See Haydn's Symphonies 5, 11, 21, 22, 34, 49 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also composed 17 works that are called seventeen \\"church sonatas\\", but these consisted of but a single movement for organ and strings to be played between the Epistle and the Gospel of the Mass.Zaslaw, Neal, with Cowdery, William eds., The Compleat Mozart: A Guide to the Musical Works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, p. 109-112, New York: W.W.

In his words, \\"it is difficult to say what is meant by art, and especially what is good, useful art, art for the sake of which we might condone such sacrifices as are being offered at its shrine\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 9. Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates an \\"unremitting moralism\\", evaluating artworks in light of his radical Christian ethics,Jahn 1975, p. 63. and displaying a willingness to dismiss accepted masters, including Wagner,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 101-12. Shakespeare,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 33-4, 137. and Dante,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95, 137. as well as the bulk of his own writings.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-198. Having rejected the use of beauty in definitions of art (see aesthetic theory), Tolstoy conceptualises art as anything that communicates emotion: \\"Art begins when a man, with the purpose of communicating to other people a feeling he once experienced, calls it up again within himself and expresses it by certain external signs\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 38. This view of art is inclusive: \\"jokes\\", \\"home decoration\\", and \\"church services\\" may all be considered art as long as they convey feeling.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41, Jahn 1975, p. 60. It is also amoral: \\"[f]eelings ‚Ä¶ very bad and very good, if only they infect the reader ‚Ä¶ constitute the subject of art\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 39. Tolstoy also notes that the \\"sincerity\\" of the artist‚Äîthat is, the extent to which the artist \\"experiences the feeling he conveys\\"‚Äîinfluences the infection.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 121, 93, 99-100.  Evaluating the content of art  While Tolstoy's basic conception of art is broadTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41. and amoral, his idea of \\"good\\" art is strict and moralistic, based on what he sees as the function of art in the development of humanity: > just as in the evolution of knowledge - that is, the forcing out and > supplanting of mistaken and unnecessary knowledge by truer and more > necessary knowledge - so the evolution of feelings takes place by means of > art, replacing lower feelings, less kind and less needed for the good of > humanity, by kinder feelings, more needed for that good. This is the purpose > of art.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 123-4.  Christian art  Tolstoy's analysis is influenced by his radical Christian views (see The Kingdom of God is Within You), views which led him to be excommunicated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901.Pevear, Richard (1995). \\"Preface\\" in Tolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). What is Art? (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky ed.). London: Penguin. p, xxii. . He states that Christian art, rooted in \\"the consciousness of sonship to God and the brotherhood of men\\":Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 130. > can evoke reverence for each man's dignity, for every animal‚Äôs life, it can > evoke the shame of luxury, of violence, of revenge, of using for one‚Äôs > pleasure objects that are a necessity for other people, it can make people > sacrifice themselves to serve others freely and joyfully, without noticing > it.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 166. Ultimately, \\"by calling up the feelings of brotherhood and love in people under imaginary conditions, religious art will accustom people to experiencing the same feelings in reality under the same conditions\\". Tolstoy's examples: Schiller's The Robbers, Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables, Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities and The Chimes, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Dostoevsky's The House of the Dead, George Eliot's Adam Bede,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 132. Ge's Judgement, Liezen-Mayer's Signing the Death Sentence, and paintings \\"portraying the labouring man with respect and love\\" such as those by Millet, Breton, Lhermitte, and Defregger.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 133. Universal art \\"Universal\\" art illustrates that people are \\"already united in the oneness of life's joys and sorrows\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 131. by communicating \\"feelings of the simplest, most everyday sort, accessible to all people without exception, such as the feelings of merriment, tenderness, cheerfulness, peacefulness, and so on\\". Tolstoy contrasts this ideal with art that is partisan in nature, whether it be by class, religion, nation, or style.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 134, 136, 152. Tolstoy's examples: he mentions, with many qualifiers, the works of Cervantes, Dickens, Moliere, Gogol, and Pushkin, comparing all of these unfavourably to the story of Joseph. In music he commends a violin aria of Bach, the E-flat major nocturne of Chopin, and \\"selected passages\\" from Schubert, Haydn, Chopin, and Mozart. He also speaks briefly of genre paintings and landscapes.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 135.  Evaluating style   Obscurity versus accessibility  Tolstoy notes the susceptibility of his contemporaries to the \\"charm of obscurity\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 63. Works have become laden with \\"euphemisms, mythological and historical allusions\\", and general \\"vagueness, mysteriousness, obscurity and inaccessibility to the masses\\". Tolstoy lambastes such works, insisting that art can and should be comprehensible to everyone. Having emphasised that art has a function in the improvement of humanity - capable of expressing man‚Äôs best sentiment - he finds it offensive that artists should be so wilfully and arrogantly abstruse.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 43, 47, 63-84, 123-4. Artificiality One criticism Tolstoy levels against art is that at some point it \\"ceased to be sincere and became artificial and cerebral\\",Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 59. leading to the creation of millions of works of technical brilliance but few of honourable sentiment.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 144. Tolstoy outlines four common markers of bad art: these are not however considered the canon or ultimate indicators # Borrowing # Imitation # Effectfulness # DiversionTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 84. = Borrowing = Involves recycling and concentrating elements from other works, typical examples of which are: \\"maidens, warriors, shepherds, hermits, angels, devils in all forms, moonlight, thunderstorms, mountains, the sea, precipices, flowers, long hair, lions, the lamb, the dove, the nightingale\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 85. = Imitation = Imitation is highly descriptive realism, where painting becomes photography, or a scene in a book becomes a listing of facial expressions, tone of voice, the setting, and so on.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 86. Any potential communication of feeling is \\"disrupted by the superfluity of details\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 88. =Effectfulness= Reliance on \\"strikingness\\", often involving contrasts of \\"horrible and tender, beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, dark and light\\", descriptions of lust, \\"crescendo and complication\\", unexpected changes in rhythm, tempo, etc.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 87. Tolstoy contends that works marked by such techniques \\"do not convey any feeling, but only affect the nerves\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 89. = Diversion = Diversion is \\"an intellectual interest added to the work of art\\", such as the melding of documentary and fiction, as well as the writing of novels, poetry, and music \\"in such a way that they must be puzzled out\\". All such works do not correspond with Tolstoy's view of art as the infection of others with feelings previously experienced,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 90. and his exhortation that art be \\"universal\\" in appeal.  The corruption of art   Causes  = Church Christianity and the Renaissance = Tolstoy approves of early Christian art for being inspired by love of Christ and man, as well as its antagonism to pleasure-seeking. He prefers this to the art born of \\"Church Christianity\\", which ostensibly evades the \\"essential theses of true Christianity\\" (that is, that all men are born of the Father, are equals, and should strive towards mutual love).Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 44. Art became pagan‚Äîworshipping religious figures‚Äîand subservient to the dictates of the Church. The corruption of art was deepened after the Crusades, as the abuse of papal power became more obvious. The rich began to doubt, seeing contradictions between the actions of the Church and the message of Christianity.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 45, 147. But instead of turning back to the early Christian teachings, the upper classes began to appreciate and commission art that was merely pleasing.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 46-8. This tendency was facilitated by the Renaissance, with the aggrandisement of ancient Greek art, philosophy, and culture which, Tolstoy alleges, is inclined to pleasure and beauty worship.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 46-50. = Aesthetic theory = Tolstoy perceives the roots of aesthetics in the Renaissance. Art for pleasure was validated in reference to the philosophy of the GreeksTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 50.Noyes, George (1918). Tolstoy. London: Duffield, p. 330. and the elevation of ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù as a legitimate criterion with which to separate good from bad art.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 53. Tolstoy moves to discredit aesthetics by reviewing and reducing previous theories - including those of Baumgarten,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 17, 30. Kant,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 20-1. Hegel,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 23. and SchopenhauerTolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 24-5. \\\\- to two main ‚Äúaesthetic definitions of beauty‚Äù:Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 31. # The \\"objective\\" or \\"mystical\\" definition of beauty in which beauty is \\"something absolutely perfect which exists outside us\\",Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 32. whether it be associated with \\"idea, spirit, will, God\\" # The \\"subjective\\" definition of beauty, in which \\"beauty is a certain pleasure we experience, which does not have personal advantage as its aim\\". This definition tends to be more inclusive, enabling things like food and fabric to be called art Tolstoy then argues that, despite their apparent divergence, there is little substantive difference between the two strands. This is because both schools recognise beauty only by the pleasure it gives: \\"both notions of beauty come down to a certain sort of pleasure that we receive, meaning that we recognize as beauty that which pleases us without awakening our lust\\". Therefore, there is no objective definition of art in aesthetics.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33. Tolstoy condemns the focus on beauty/pleasure at length, calling aesthetics a discipline: > according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, > and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of > the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure - against which all > teachers of mankind have warned people - came to be regarded as the highest > art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the > empty amusement of idle people. = Professionalism = Tolstoy sees the developing professionalism of art as hampering the creation of good works. The professional artist can and must create to prosper, making for art that is insincere and most likely partisan - made to suit the whims of fashion or patrons.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 93-4. Art criticism is a symptom of the obscurity of art, for \\"[a]n artist, if he is a true artist, has in his work conveyed to others the feelings he has experienced: what is there to explain?\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 94. Criticism, moreover, tends to contribute to the veneration of \\"authorities\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95. such as Shakespeare and Dante.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 96. By constant unfavourable comparison, the young artist is corralled into imitating the works of the greats, as all of them are said to be true art. In short, new artists imitate the classics, setting their own feelings aside, which, according to Tolstoy, is contrary to the point of art.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 95-6, 121. Art schools teach people how to imitate the method of the masters, but they cannot teach the sincerity of emotion that is the propellant of great works.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 98. In Tolstoy's words, \\"[n]o school can call up feelings in a man, and still less can it teach a man what is the essence of art: the manifestation of feeling in his own particular fashion\\".  Consequences  # \\"[T]he enormous waste of working people's labour\\",Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 139. with individuals spending so much time contemplating and creating bad art that they become \\"incapable of anything that is really necessary for people\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 140. # The volume of art produced provides \\"the amusement which turns these people's eyes from the meaninglessness of their lives and saves them from the boredom that oppresses them\\", it enables them \\"to go on living without noticing the meaninglessness and cruelty of their life\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 141. # The confusion and perversion of values.

Criticism of famous artists Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates a willingness to dismiss generally accepted masters, among them Liszt, Richard Strauss, Nietzsche, and Oscar Wilde. He also labels his own works as \\"bad art\\", excepting only the short stories \\"God Sees the Truth\\" and \\"Prisoner of the Caucasus\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-8. He attempts to justify these conclusions by pointing to the ostensible chaos of previous aesthetic analysis. Theories usually involve selecting popular works and constructing principles from these examples. Volkelt, for instance, remarks that art cannot be judged on its moral content because then Romeo and Juliet would not be good art. Such retrospective justification cannot, he stresses, be the basis for theory, as people will tend to create subjective frameworks to justify their own tastes.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33-4. Reception Jahn notes the \\"often confusing use of categorisation\\"Jahn 1975, p. 59. and the lack of definition of the key concept of emotion.Jahn 1975, pp. 61-2 Bayley writes that \\"the effectiveness of What is Art? lies not so much in its positive assertions as in its rejection of much that was taken for granted in the aesthetic theories of the time\\".Bayley, John (1986 [1966]).

It is the seventh-largest estuary in the United States, and the largest of seven major estuaries along the Texas Gulf Coast. It is connected to the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by sub-tropical marshes and prairies on the mainland. The water in the bay is a complex mixture of sea water and fresh water, which supports a wide variety of marine life. With a maximum depth of about and an average depth of only , it is unusually shallow for its size. The bay has played a significant role in the history of Texas. Galveston Island is home to the city of Galveston, the earliest major settlement in southeast Texas and the state's largest city toward the end of the nineteenth century. While a devastating hurricane in 1900 hastened Galveston's decline, the subsequent rise of Houston as a major trade center, facilitated by the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel across the western half of the bay, ensured the bay's continued economic importance. Today, Galveston Bay is encompassed by Greater Houston, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. The Port of Houston, which has facilities spread across the northwestern section of the bay, is the second-busiest port in the nation by overall tonnage. Other major ports utilizing the bay include the Port of Texas City and the Port of Galveston. With its diverse marine life, Galveston Bay also produces more seafood than any estuary in the United States except the Chesapeake. History The Gulf Coast gained its present configuration during the most recent glacial period approximately 18 ka (thousands of years ago). Low global sea levels allowed the Texas mainland to extend significantly farther south than it does presently, and the Trinity River had carved a deep canyon through present-day Bolivar Roads (the exit of the Houston Ship Channel) on its way to the coast. As the glacial period came to a close, rising sea levels initially filled this narrow canyon, followed by the broad lowlands of present-day Trinity Bay. Rapid sea level rise between 7.7 and 5.5 ka shifted the Gulf coastline northward to its contemporary latitude. This was quickly followed by the formation of Galveston Island (5.5 ka), a barrier island, and Bolivar Peninsula (2.5 ka), which began as a spit. Human settlement in what is now Texas began at least 10 ka following migrations into the Americas from Asia during the last ice age. The first substantial settlements in the area are believed to have been made by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes, who lived throughout the Gulf Coast region. Anonymous portrait claimed to be of Jean Lafitte in the early 19th century Though several Spanish expeditions charted the Gulf Coast, it was explorer Jos√© Antonio de Evia who in 1785 gave the bay and the island the name G√°lvezton in honor of Spanish viceroy Bernardo de G√°lvez. Louis Aury established a naval base at the harbor in 1816 to support the Mexican War of Independence. When he abandoned the base, it was then taken over by pirate Jean Lafitte, who temporarily transformed Galveston Island and the bay into a haven for outlaws before being ousted by the United States Navy. Following its independence from Spain, the new nation of Mexico claimed Texas as part of its territory. Settlements were established around the bay, including Galveston, Anahuac, Lynchburg, and San Jacinto. Following growing unrest, Texas revolted and gained independence in 1836 at the Battle of San Jacinto, near the bay along the San Jacinto River. The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly and joined the United States in 1845. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, residents of Galveston strongly supported secession and sided with the Confederacy as the Civil War broke out. However, separation from the Union did not last long; the city's harbor was blockaded by the federal navy starting in July 1861, followed by a full-scale occupation after the Battle of Galveston Harbor in October 1862. However, at the Battle of Galveston in January 1863, a small Confederate force managed to overwhelm the Union's naval forces in the bay and retake the island. Despite this victory, the Union continued to blockade the outlets of Galveston Bay until the end of the war. Reconstruction was swift in southeast Texas. Ranching interests were major economic drivers on the mainland in the 19th century. The city of Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center for shipping cotton, leather products, cattle, and other goods produced in the growing state. Railroads were built around the shore and new communities continued to emerge. Beach Hotel, a famous 19th century Galveston resort The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 devastated the city of Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. Growth moved inland to Houston, as fear of the risks posed by establishing businesses at Galveston limited the island's ability to compete. Texas City emerged as another important port in the area. Shipping traffic through the bay expanded dramatically after the federal government completed the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel to a depth of in 1914. The Texas oil boom began in 1901, and by 1915 oil production by the bay was fully underway. Oil wells and refineries quickly developed throughout the area. After frozen transport became available in the 1920s, commercial fishing developed as a substantial industry, producing particularly oysters, finfish, and, later, shrimp. By the end of the 1930s, the Port of Houston was the largest cotton port and third largest port by overall tonnage in the United States. NASA Johnson Space Center with Clear Lake visible at the top of the image The establishment of NASA's Johnson Space Center near the bay in the Clear Lake Area in 1963 brought new growth. By the 1970s Houston had become one the nation's largest cities, and its expansion connected it with the bay communities. The bay's shoreline became heavily urbanized and industrialized, leading to pollution of the bay. In the 1970s the bay was described by U.S. Representative Robert C. Eckhardt as \\"the most polluted body of water in the U.S.\\" The ship channel and Clear Lake were rated by the Galveston Bay Estuary Program as having even worse water quality. Extraction of oil and groundwater, as well as large wakes from increasing shipping in the bay, led to land subsidence and erosion along the shoreline, especially in the Baytown‚ÄìPasadena area.Henson (1993), p. 51. Over the past few decades, approximately of the historic San Jacinto battleground has been submerged; Sylvan Beach, a popular destination in La Porte, has been severely eroded, and the once prominent Brownwood neighborhood of Baytown has been abandoned. On February 23, 2019, Atlas Air Flight 3591 crashed into Trinity Bay, one of the bay's extensions, killing all three people on board. Today, the bay is a major destination for recreational and tourist activities, including boating, ecotourism, and waterfowl hunting. Features Trinity Bay (purple), East Bay (green), West Bay (orange) Galveston Bay covers approximately , and is long and wide. The bay has an average depth of and a maximum undredged depth of . The Galveston Bay system consists of four main bodies of water: Galveston Bay proper (upper and lower), Trinity Bay, East Bay, and West Bay. The bay is bordered by three counties: Chambers, Harris, and Galveston. Significant communities around the bay include Houston, Pasadena, League City, Baytown, Texas City, Galveston, La Porte, Seabrook, and Anahuac. Galveston Bay has three outlets to the Gulf of Mexico: Bolivar Roads between Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula, San Luis Pass at the west end of Galveston Island, and Rollover Pass across Bolivar Peninsula. Many smaller bays and lakes are connected to the main system, including Christmas Bay, Moses Lake, Dickinson Bay, Clear Lake, Ash Lake, Black Duck Bay, and San Jacinto Bay. Together with its extensions, Galveston Bay forms the largest of the seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, an inland waterway consisting of natural watercourses and man-made canals, runs between the bay and the Gulf. A majority of the bay's inflow comes from the Trinity River, which contributes of freshwater annually. The San Jacinto River contributes another . Local coastal watersheds contribute the remainder. =Climate= The climate around the Bay is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in K√∂ppen climate classification system). Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring heat from the deserts of Mexico and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Summer temperatures regularly exceed , and the area's humidity drives the heat index even higher. Winters in the area are mild, with typical January highs above and lows above . Snowfall is generally rare. Annual rainfall averages well over , with some areas typically receiving over . Hurricanes are an ever- present threat during the fall season. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are generally at the greatest risk. However, though the island and the peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge. Hurricane Ike, the most economically and environmentally destructive event on the bay since 1900, struck in 2008. A proposal to build a flood barrier system to prevent against future storm surge, the so-called Ike Dike, has been considered by the state government. In August 2017, the Galveston Bay Area was struck by Hurricane Harvey and received an extraordinary amount of rainfall in a matter of days, with many locations in the bay area observing more than of precipitation during the storm. Ecosystem This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources provides nursery and spawning grounds for many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish, thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. The deeper navigation channels of the bay provide suitable habitats for bottlenose dolphins, which feed on the abundant fish varieties. Additionally, the bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the bay support their own collection of ecosystems, containing diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The wetlands that surround the bay support a variety of fauna. Notable terrestrial species include the American alligator and the bobcat, while bird species include the roseate spoonbill, great and snowy egret, white-faced ibis, and mottled duck. =Pollution= City of Houston storm drains lead into Galveston Bay; messages ask people to keep the ecosystem in mind. In the early 1990s, the Houston Ship Channel had the fifth highest level of toxic chemicals in the nation due to industrial discharge, with over discharged between 1990 and 1994. However, the bay has generally experienced improving water quality since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. The Houston Area Research Council (HARC) and Galveston Bay Foundation periodically release the Galveston Bay Report Card, which grades a number of metrics indicative of the health of the bay's ecosystem and waters. The 2019 report assigned a \\"C\\" grade for toxins in bay sediments, citing water and soil pollution, wildlife habitat loss, and the impacts of climate change as challenges facing the estuary. The presence of the San Jacinto Pits Superfund site in the Houston Ship Channel, which contains large amounts of dioxin, is considered a significant threat to the bay's health. The entire bay is covered by seafood consumption advisories set by the Texas Department of State Health Services, but the strictness of these standards varies by location. In the Ship Channel, advisories recommend against the consumption of all fish and blue crab, while in the lower bay, advisories only apply to catfish. Oil spills are a routine consequence of the industrial activity around Galveston Bay, with hundreds of spills taking place in a typical year. On March 22, 2014, a barge carrying marine fuel oil collided with another ship in the Houston Ship Channel, causing the contents of one of the barge's tanks to leak into the bay, requiring weeks of cleanup by dozens of boats. Excessive ozone levels can occur due to industrial activities; nearby Houston is ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. The industries located along the ship channel are a major cause of ozone pollution.  Industry  Galveston Bay Area municipalities Galveston Bay is located in Greater Houston, which is the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States, and home to one of the nation's most significant shipping centers. Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, is the economic and cultural center of the region. Important ports served by the bay include the Port of Houston, the Port of Texas City, and the Port of Galveston. The Houston Ship Channel, which connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf, passes through the bay. It is a partially man-made feature created by dredging the Buffalo Bayou, the ship channel subbays, and Galveston Bay. The area has a broad industrial base including the energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, transportation, and health care sectors. The bayside communities in particular are home to the Johnson Space Center, which houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, Ellington Airport (home of the Houston Spaceport), and a high concentration of petrochemical refineries. Weisman (2008), pg. 166,\\"The industrial megaplex that begins on the east side of Houston and continues uninterrupted to the Gulf of Mexico, 50 miles away, is the largest concentration of petroleum refineries, petrochemical companies, and storage structures on Earth.\\" A large commercial fishing industry has grown around Galveston Bay, with significant production of shrimp, blue crab, eastern oyster, black drum, flounder, sheepshead, and snapper. In 2012, the commercial fish harvest in Galveston Bay amounted to , with a wholesale value of roughly $16.4 million. Galveston Bay supports a significant recreation and tourism industry, especially as a result of its proximity to major population centers. Over 40% of Greater Houston residents participate annually in hiking and swimming along the bay, while 20% go fishing and 15% go boating. The five counties surrounding the bay are home to 88,000 registered pleasure crafts. Fishing expenditures (such as the purchase of fishing bait or lodging) along Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake generate approximately $650 million annually. The recreational fishing industry supports over 3,000 jobs in the bay area. With over 600 species of birds, Galveston Bay is a popular destination for birdwatching. This sort of ecotourism generates millions in annual revenue for Chambers County, which is home to the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge and High Island.

During the war itself, Lane served as a United States Senator and as a general for the Union. Although reelected as a Senator during 1865, Lane committed suicide the next year. Early life The son of Amos Lane, Lane was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, where he practiced law when he was admitted to the state bar during 1840. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he successively commanded the 3rd and 5th Indiana Regiments. He was a U.S. congressman from Indiana (1853‚Äì1855) where he voted for the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. He relocated to the Kansas Territory during 1855. He immediately became involved with abolitionism in Kansas and was often termed the commander of the Free State Army (\\"The Red Legs\\" or Jayhawkers), a major Free Soil militant group. In 1855 he was the president of the convention that drafted the anti- slavery Topeka Constitution. On June 3, 1858, Lane shot and killed Gaius Jenkins in a land dispute in Lawrence. According to reports Jenkins was coming to get water from a well on the disputed property.https://territorialkansasonline.ku.edu/index.php?SCREEN=show_document&SCREEN;_FROM=immigration&document;_id=102878&FROM;_PAGE=&topic;_id=141 Jenkins was reported to have been displaying a revolver. Lane met him with a shotgun. One of the men with Jenkins shot Lane in the leg and Lane returned fire killing Jenkins.https://civilwaronthewesternborder.org/timeline/jim-lane- shoots-gaius-jenkins Lane was acquitted in the trial, which kept him from participating in the convention drafting of the Wyandotte Constitution, later the official constitution for Kansas.https://civilwaronthewesternborder.org/encyclopedia/wyandotte- constitution After the Free Soilers succeeded in getting Kansas admitted to the Union during 1861 as a free state, Lane was elected as one of the new state's first U.S. Senators, and reelected during 1865 Civil War During the American Civil War, in addition to his Senate service, Lane formed a brigade of \\"Jayhawkers\\" known as the \\"Kansas Brigade\\", or \\"Lane's Brigade\\", composed of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Kansas Volunteers. He commanded the force into action against pro-Southern General Sterling Price of Missouri in the Battle of Dry Wood Creek, as Price began an offensive early in the War to retake Missouri for the pro-Confederate state government that had been deposed by pro-Union forces around St. Louis. Lane lost the battle but stayed behind and attacked pro-South areas in Missouri behind Price. During the Battle of Hemp Bales, General John Charles Fremont ordered General Henry Lane to make a \\"demonstration along the Kansas Missouri border with his Jayhawkers\\". Lane acted gladly on Fremont's official authorization for a raid into Missouri. He raided the village of Morristown near the state line, burned it and swept a wide path of pillage, arson and murder of private citizens through the Missouri territory six miles wide and fifteen miles long. However as it turns out it had little to no effect on Mulligan.The Army of Tennessee p. 31 \\"His raids culminated in the Sacking of Osceola, in which Lane's forces killed at least nine men, then pillaged, looted, and then burned the town; these events inspired the novel Gone to Texas by Forrest Carter, which was the basis for the 1976 Clint Eastwood movie The Outlaw Josey Wales. Lane was criticized for his violence in Osceola, most severely by General Henry Halleck, then Commander of the Department of Missouri. Of their actions, he would state: \\"The course pursued by those under Lane and Jennison has turned against us many thousands who were formerly Union men. A few more such raids will make this State unanimous against us.\\" Thus, Lane's Brigade was ended.James H. Lane - Grim Leader in the Free-State Fight On December 18, 1861 Lane was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. On March 21, 1862, his commission was canceled in culmination of an argument over whether a sitting U.S. Senator could concurrently have the rank of General.Eicher p.338 However, on April 11, 1862, he was reinstated as brigadier general of volunteers with the confirmation of the U.S. Senate. During 1862‚Äì1863, he served as recruiting commissioner for the State of Kansas. On October 27‚Äì29, 1862, U.S. Senator Jim Lane recruited the 1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored) who debuted at the Skirmish at Island Mound. They are the first African-American troops to fight in the war, a year before the 54th Massachusetts. In their first action, 30 of their members defeated 130 mounted Confederate guerrillas.Border War Timeline, 1861 - 1865: The Civil War Lane was the target of the event that became the Lawrence Massacre (or Quantrill's Raid) on August 21, 1863. Confederate guerrillas could be heard shouting, \\"Remember Osceola!\\" Though Lane was in residence in Lawrence at the time, he was able to escape the attack by racing through a nearby ravine. During 1864 when Sterling Price invaded Missouri, Lane served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Army of the Border. Lane was with the victorious Union forces at the battle of Westport. Speech made in the US Senate by a Senator James Henry Lane from Kansas. \\"I would like to live long enough to see every white man in South Carolina in hell, and the Negroes inheriting their territory. It would not wound my feelings any day to find the dead bodies of rebel sympathizers pierced with bullet holes in every street and alley of Washington. Yes, I would regret this, for I would not like to witness all this waste of powder and lead. I would rather have them hung, and the ropes saved! Let them dangle until their stinking bodies rot and fall to the ground piece by piece.\\" Death and legacy On July 1, 1866 Lane shot himself in the head as he jumped from his carriage in Leavenworth, Kansas. He was allegedly deranged, depressed, had been charged with abandoning his fellow Radical Republicans and had been accused of financial irregularities. He died ten days later near Leavenworth, Kansas, a result of the self-inflicted gunshot. Edmund G. Ross was appointed to succeed him in the Senate.

It was formerly considered conspecific with the southern caracara (C. plancus) and the extinct Guadalupe caracara (C. lutosa) as the \\"crested caracara\\". It has also been known as Audubon's caracara. As with its relatives, the northern caracara was formerly placed in the genus Polyborus. Unlike the Falco falcons in the same family, the caracaras are not fast-flying aerial hunters, but are rather sluggish and often scavengers. Distribution The northern caracara is a resident in Cuba, northern South America (south to northern Peru and northern Amazonian Brazil) and most of Central America and Mexico, just reaching the southernmost parts of the United States, including Florida, where it has been seen on the East coast as far as extreme eastern Seminole County(Lake Harney), Florida where it is now considered a resident but listed as threatened. There have been reports of the northern caracara as far north as San Francisco, California. and, in 2012, near Crescent City, California. In July 2016 a northern caracara was reported and photographed by numerous people in the upper peninsula of Michigan, just outside of Munising. In June 2017, a northern caracara was sighted far north in St. George, New Brunswick, Canada. A specimen was photographed in Woodstock, Vermont in March 2020. The species has recently become more common in central and north Texas and is generally common in south Texas and south of the US border. It can also be found (nesting) in the Southern Caribbean (e.g. Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire). Description The mottled breast and pinkish-purple facial skin and cere are typical of immatures The northern caracara has a length of , a wingspan of , and weighs .Morrison, J. L. and J. F.

Princeton University Press. Average weight is considerably higher in the north of the range, smaller in the tropics. In Florida, 21 male birds averaged and 18 female birds averaged . In Panama, males were found to average and females averaged .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . Among caracaras, it is second in size only to the southern caracara. Broad-winged and long-tailed, it also has long legs and frequently walks and runs on the ground. It is very cross-shaped in flight. The adult has a black body, wings, crest and crown. The neck, rump, and conspicuous wing patches are white, and the tail is white with black barring and a broad terminal band. The breast is white, finely barred with black. The bill is thick, grey and hooked, and the legs are yellow. The cere and facial skin are deep yellow to orange- red depending on age and mood. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are browner, have a buff neck and throat, a pale breast streaked/mottled with brown, greyish-white legs and greyish or dull pinkish-purple facial skin and cere. The voice of this species is a low rattle. Adults can be separated from the similar southern caracara by their less extensive and more spotty barring to the chest, more uniform blackish scapulars (brownish and often lightly mottled/barred in the southern), and blackish lower back (pale with dark barring in the southern). Individuals showing intermediate features are known from the small area of contact in north-central Brazil, but intergradation between the two species is generally limited. Habitat Northern caracaras inhabit various types of open and semi-open country. They typically live in lowlands but can live to mid-elevation in the northern Andes. The species is most common in cattle ranches with scattered trees, shelterbelts and small woods, as long as there is a somewhat limited human presence. They can also be found in other varieties of agricultural land, as well as prairies, coastal woodlands (including mangroves), coconuts plantations, scrub along beach dunes and open uplands. Behavior Northern caracaras fighting. Painted by John James Audubon. The northern caracara is a carnivorous scavenger that mainly feeds on carrion, but does occasionally eat fruit. The live prey they do catch is usually immobile, injured, incapacitated or young. Prey species can include small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish, crabs, insects, their larvae, earthworms, shellfish and young birds. Bird species that are culled can range from large, colonial nesting birds such as storks and herons to small passerines. Reptiles taken often including snakes, lizards and small freshwater turtles as well as young American alligators. This species, along with other caracaras, is one of few raptors that hunts on foot, often turning over branches and cow dung to reach food. In addition to hunting its own food on the ground, the northern caracara will steal from other birds, including vultures, buteos, pelicans, ibises and spoonbills. Because they stay low to the ground even when flying, they often beat Cathartes vultures to carrion and can aggressively displace single vultures of most species from small carcasses. They also dominate crows at carrion sites but are subordinate to the much larger bald eagle.Dwyer, J. F. (2014). Correlation of cere color with intra-and interspecific agonistic interactions of Crested Caracaras. Journal of Raptor Research, 48(3), 240-247. They will occasionally follow trains or automobiles to fetch food that falls off. An unexceptedly large volume of insects and spiders can be found in the diet in the southern United States.Morrison, J. L., Pias, K. E., Abrams, J., Gottlieb, I. G., Deyrup, M., & McMillian, M. (2008). Invertebrate diet of breeding and nonbreeding Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheriway) in Florida. Journal of Raptor Research, 42(1), 38-47.Morrison, J. L., Abrams, J., Deyrup, M., Eisner, T., & McMillian, M. (2007). Noxious menu: Chemically protected insects in the diet of Caracara cheriway (Northern Crested Caracara). Southeastern Naturalist, 6(1), 1-14. In Florida, it was estimated that about 33% of vertebrate prey was obtained as carrion, which indicated that hunting groups may be capable of dispatching unusually large live prey, including Virginia opossum and skunks.Morrison, J. L., & Pias, K. E. (2006). Assessing the vertebrate component of the diet of Florida's crested caracaras (Caracara cheriway). Florida Scientist, 36-43. Adults of various water birds up to the size of egrets, grebes and even American white ibis are sometimes also killed by caracaras.P√©rez-Estrada, C. J., & Rodr√≠guez-Estrella, R. (2016). Caracara cheriway predation on migratory waterbirds, Egretta thula and Podiceps nigricollis, in southern Baja California Peninsula. Acta Zool√≥gica Mexicana (nueva serie), 32(1), 129-131. Northern caracaras can usually be spotted either alone, in pairs or family parties of 3‚Äì5 birds. Occasionally roosts may contain more than a dozen caracaras and abundant food sources can cause more than 75 to gather. The nesting season is from December to May and is a bit earlier the closer the birds live to the tropics. They build large stick nests in trees such as mesquites and palms, cacti, or on the ground as a last resort. The nests are bulky and untidy, wide and deep, often made of grasses, sticks and hay, spotted with much animal matter. It lays 2 to 3 (rarely 1 to 4) pinkish-brown eggs with darker blotches, which are incubated for 28‚Äì32 days. Although mesopredators such as raccoons and fish crows may steal eggs and nestlings from nests in Florida, adults may have no known natural predators.Layne, J. N. (1996). Audubon's Crested Caracara. In Rare and endangered biota of Florida. Vol. V: Birds., edited by Jr J. A. Rogers, H. W. Kale Ii and H. T. Smith, 197-210. Gainesville: Univ. of Florida Press. Red imported fire ants are another known predator of nestling crested caracaras.Dickinson, V. M. (1995). Red imported fire ant predation on Crested Caracara nestlings in south Texas. Wilson Bulletin 107:761-762. Taxonomy C. prelutosus fossil Though the northern caracaras of our time are not divided into subspecies as their variation is clinal, prehistoric subspecies are known. Due to the confused taxonomic history of the crested caracaras, their relationships to the modern birds are in need of restudy: * Caracara cheriway grinnelli (La Brea caracara: Late Pleistocene of California) * Caracara cheriway prelutosus (Late Pleistocene of Mexico) The former almost certainly represents birds which were the direct ancestors of the living population. The latter may actually be the ancestor of the Guadalupe caracara. A DNA analysis of 2,500 year old bones of the recently extinct Bahaman caracara, shows that the species was closely related to the northern crested caracara and the southern crested caracara. The three species having last shared a common ancestor between 1.2 and 0.4 million years ago. Florida caracara The state of Florida is home to a relict population of northern caracaras that dates to the last glacial period, which ended around 12,500 BP. At that point in time, Florida and the rest of the Gulf Coast was covered in an oak savanna. As temperatures increased, the savanna between Florida and Texas disappeared. Caracaras were able to survive in the prairies of central Florida as well as in the marshes along the St. Johns River. Cabbage palmettos are a preferred nesting site, although they will also nest in southern live oaks. Their historical range on the modern-day Florida peninsula included Okeechobee, Osceola, Highlands, Glades, Polk, Indian River, St. Lucie, Hardee, DeSoto, Brevard, Collier, and Martin counties. They are currently most common in DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee and Osceola counties. Loss of adequate habitat caused the Florida caracara population to decline, and it was listed as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987. Northern caracara in Mexico The Mexican ornithologist Rafael Mart√≠n del Campo proposed that the northern caracara was probably the sacred \\"eagle\\" depicted in several pre-Columbian Aztec codices as well as the Florentine Codex. This imagery was adopted as a national symbol of Mexico, and is seen on the flag among other places. Since the paintings were interpreted as showing the golden eagle, it became the national bird. Texan eagle Balduin M√∂llhausen, the German artist accompanying the 1853 railroad survey, led by Lt. Amiel Weeks Whipple, from the Canadian River to California along the 35th parallel, recounted observing what he called the \\"Texan Eagle,\\" which, in his account, he identified as Audubon's Polyborus vulgaris. This sighting occurred in the San Bois Mountains in southeastern Oklahoma.

It was one of the worst tornadoes in Texas history, and occurred exactly 17 years to the day after the deadly Waco Tornado. It is also the most recent F5 tornado to have struck a central business district of a large city.Downtown Tornadoes Development At 10 am on 11 May 1970, the SELS (Severe Local Storms unit) issued an outlook that stated that isolated thunderstorms were possible in the High Plains region of West Texas, and amended the outlook at 1:25 pm to include the possibility that some of the storms may become severe. Warm and dry conditions dominated the area throughout the afternoon; the temperature peaked at a high of 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C) with moderate humidity. At 6 pm, large cumulus clouds began to appear in the area, and at 6:30 the first echoes indicating thunderstorms began to appear on radar scopes in nearby Amarillo. Less than half an hour later, Lubbock radar indicated the first thunderstorm activity in the immediate Lubbock vicinity: a moderate storm just south of the city near the small farming community of Woodrow. Conditions continued to deteriorate through the early evening, and at 7:30 the local weather bureau issued a forecast which included the developing thunderstorm activity. By 7:45 the thunderstorm south of the city was indicated by radar to be increasing in intensity, and at 7:50 the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Lubbock, Crosby and Floyd counties. Shortly afterward, reports of rapidly deteriorating conditions on the south side of the city of Lubbock began to come into the weather bureau and by 8:05, citizens south of the city were reporting golf ball-sized hail to the bureau. Tornado activity begins At 8:10 pm, an off-duty Lubbock police officer spotted a funnel cloud on the east side of the city, and grapefruit- size hail was reported. At 8:15, local radar indicated a hook echo and a tornado warning was issued for Lubbock and Crosby counties, and the first tornado to strike the city touched down seven miles south of Lubbock Municipal Airport, near the intersection of Quirt Avenue and Broadway. Since it was in a relatively sparsely populated area of the city, this first tornado caused little significant damage; however, reports of damaging hail continued to come in from around the city. At 9:15, tornado sirens in Idalou were sounded, and by 9:30 baseball-sized hail was falling in the northeastern sector of Lubbock. At about 9:35 pm, a second and much more significant tornado touched down near the campus of Texas Tech University, snapping light poles at Jones Stadium, home of the Red Raider football team, then began to track northeast, carving a path of destruction that at its peak reached almost two miles in width right through the heart of the city. The devastating twister tore through several densely populated residential areas before slicing through downtown, dealing a direct blow to the First National Bank building and the Great Plains Life building. The tornado then moved north toward the airport, where at 10:00 pm, anemometers were already reading winds of 77 knots (approximately . At 9:46, power failed at the Lubbock Civil Defense headquarters, and three minutes later, the local weather bureau lost power and its personnel took shelter from the tornado, which was now bearing down on the area and passed over the Weather Bureau building at 10:03 pm. The tornado continued north-northeast toward the communities of Abernathy and New Deal, where local authorities had begun sounding tornado sirens due to alerts passed along to them via two-way radio by the officials at the crippled Lubbock Weather Bureau office. The tornado finally dissipated at about 10:10 pm near the community of Petersburg.  Aftermath  The second tornado was devastating, affecting a area or roughly a quarter of Lubbock. Hardest hit were the inner city commercial and residential areas, the light industrial area south of Loop 289, and the residential area north of Loop 289 and the Lubbock Municipal Airport. A total of 430 homes were destroyed, 519 sustained major damage, and 7,851 more sustained minor damage. Some of the homes were completely swept away. Another 600 apartments were destroyed and 549 damaged, and one hundred mobile homes were severely damaged or destroyed. The Guadalupe neighborhood, consisting of mostly old wood frame or stucco homes, and parts of the Mesa Road area near the Lubbock Country Club, were almost completely leveled. Since the tornado hit the downtown area, over 250 businesses were also severely damaged or destroyed, including 20 city and county offices. Every motel along 4th Street and Avenue Q north of 10th Street sustained major damage, and several motels and other businesses along Avenue Q, which is a major artery through the city, were destroyed. Several banks and warehouses were severely damaged, and one nightclub lost its entire top floor. Eight elementary schools were damaged, as well as Lubbock and Estacado high schools, the latter losing a large portion of the roof over the gym. Damage was especially severe in the industrial areas of north Lubbock. At a grain storage complex, thick steel covers were peeled back from the tops of silos like soup cans. A 41-foot-long metal fertilizer tank, weighing 26,000 pounds, was thrown nearly a mile through the air. Large oil tanks in this area were hurled up to 300 yards away, and a railroad car was rolled for 50 yards.http://extremeplanet.me/2013/03/11/violent-tornadoes- that-have-struck-downtown-areas/ The Great Plains Life Building was left with a visible twist in its superstructure, leaving many to fear it was in danger of collapse; several radio towers on the roof were twisted or broken off. Much of the plaster in the stairwell walls between the 4th and 16th floors had cracked, and 60% of the building's windows were shattered. A foot of permanent deformation damage occurred at the steel frame on the south side, and three of the building's four elevators were damaged, with the support rails bent. In spite of the severity of the damage and amid cries to demolish, the owners chose to repair it instead, and it still stands. Some sources erroneously claim that the building was impacted by F5 winds. A thorough damage survey indicated that the F5 damage contour commenced farther north in the Guadalupe neighborhood. In addition to damage to buildings, there was damage to other property. Over 10,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed, and at Lubbock Municipal Airport, 100 private aircraft and 19 military planes were destroyed. Many utilities were damaged or destroyed and 220 light poles were toppled, leaving the city's two utility companies scrambling to restore power in the days immediately following the storm. The Southwestern Bell Company reported that 25,000 telephones were knocked out of service and 600 long distance lines were ruined. There was extensive ecological damages as well; many trees were damaged or destroyed, including the city's aged Chinese elm trees. Mackenzie State Park, Pioneer Park, Guadalupe Park and the Texas Tech campus lost almost all of their trees. Damage totaled $250 million, ($820,000,000 in 2015 dollars), making it the costliest U.S. tornado until it was surpassed by the Omaha Tornado of 1975. The storm's final death toll was 26 or 31; victims ranged in age from 9 months to 88 years of age. Many of the victims were found in their homes, where they had been killed by flying debris or structural collapse. One boy lost his life when he was sucked out of the car he was riding in, and an entire family of five died when their house was lifted from its foundation, hurled over 200 yards, and slammed into a field. However, the family's fatalities were not recorded by Lubbock, meaning that the death toll could have been as high as 31. Another five hundred people were injured. After the storm, Mayor Jim Granberry imposed a curfew, and Police Chief J.T. Alley issued orders that looters would be shot on sight. No looting was reported throughout the ordeal. The city council was directed to lead the rebuilding process, which continued under Granberry's successor, Morris W. Turner. The Lubbock Tornado also served as a model for the development of the Fujita scale, developed a year later. Bud Andrews and Ernesto Barton, Lubbock radio broadcasters, were given Presidential Citations from then U.S. President Richard M. Nixon for coverage of the disaster.

History of New South Wales 1827 births 1914 deaths Burials at Waverley Cemetery ","title":"Thomas New"},{"id":"593610","text":"The Waverley Cemetery is a heritage-listed cemetery on top of the cliffs at Bronte in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Opened in 1877 and built by R. Watkins (cemetery lodge, 1878) and P. Beddie (cemetery office, 1915), the cemetery is noted for its largely intact Victorian and Edwardian monuments. It is regularly cited as being one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. The cemetery contains the graves of many significant Australians including the poet Henry Lawson. It is also known as Waverley Cemetery and General Cemetery Waverley. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 October 2016. The cemetery is owned by Waverley Council and is self-funded, deriving its income from interments ‚Äì including burial, cremation, memorials and mausolea ‚Äì of which there has been over 86,000. Waverley Cemetery was used during the filming of the 1979 Mel Gibson film Tim. The cemetery was designed to function along similar lines to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Funerals are conducted Monday to Saturday.  History  =Indigenous history= The land on which Waverley Cemetery is located is traditionally the land of the Cadigal people of the Eora nation. As with most Aboriginal groups in Australia prior to European colonisation, the Cadigal people lived a traditional hunter- gatherer lifestyle that utilised the natural resources available in their environment to achieve the physical and spiritual nourishment to sustain their way of life. Evidence of the areas occupation by the Cadigal people is demonstrated in both archaeological (rock shelters, art sites, middens) and non-archaeological forms (creation sites, ceremonial places). Today, the Waverley area is a densely populated and urban environment and, although Waverley Cemetery is not known to contain identified Aboriginal sites (to date), its cliff top environment is regarded as archaeologically sensitive as it is considered likely to contain sites of Aboriginal significance. =Colonial history= European exploration into the coastal region of eastern Sydney commenced in the early 19th century when the establishment of a military outpost at South Head and the completion of the first roadway to the South Head Lighthouse (1811) gave settlers their first cursory view of the coastal landscape of the new colony. The opening up of the region soon saw the allocation of early land grants to prominent settlers in the locality. In the early years of the colony, the first cemetery (although never formally gazetted) was established on the outskirts of the town on the site of today's Sydney Town Hall. At the time of its selection and development in the 1790s, the Old Sydney Burial Ground reflected the attitudes of the European colonists of the period towards death and burial - essentially relegating cemeteries to the periphery of the colony out of fear of ill-health, disease and contamination from the dead. At this time, cemeteries were a necessity and not a place of remembrance and commemoration. By 1820, the Old Sydney Burial Ground was considered full and a new cemetery was laid out at Devonshire Street (Brickfield Hill), today's Sydney's Central railway station. Soon enough, by the middle of the century, this cemetery too was at capacity and an alternative location for the Sydney Necropolis was sought. In keeping with common social values, Haslem's Creek (now Rookwood Cemetery) was selected as the new location in 1862. Sited on the outskirts of both the Sydney and Parramatta settlements, Haslem's Creek was also served by the main western railway line. The relocation of burial services away from central Sydney soon caused difficulties for those living along the eastern coastline and those residents quickly became reliant on St. Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick (1853). Although a cemetery was planned from the 1840s, interments did not take place at South Head General Cemetery until 1869. Waverley Municipal Council, itself only proclaimed in 1859, soon recognised that a general cemetery was needed to service the developing community of the eastern suburbs and, in 1868, reserved A¬£1,200 to purchase for the establishment of the cemetery. Although the selected land remained on the periphery of the community, social attitudes towards death and burial had shifted by this time, away from those held during the early years of the colony. Society now desired picturesque, garden-like spaces where people could visit, remember and commemorate those who had passed. Cemeteries were no longer to be dark and forbidding places, avoided out of fear and paranoia. Following the purchase of a further , Waverley Cemetery was formally opened on 1 August 1877 and its first interment (of Ruth Allen, 85 years), took place on the afternoon of 4 August 1877. From its first intimations, Waverley Cemetery was to be a grand metropolitan cemetery honouring the high moral standard and respect of the Victorian era and it would reflect the social prosperity of the Waverley community. To manage the operation of the new facility, William Thomas was appointed as the first manager of Waverley Cemetery in 1877. Responsible for its day-to-day operation, Thomas conducted the development of the cemetery in accordance with a strict set of bylaws that governed its objectives with particular regard to style, layout and colours of headstones, grave sites and funerary furniture. Laid out professionally as a cemetery of the Victorian style and with its recurring use of ethereally white Italian Carrara marble, Waverley Cemetery soon resembled a strategic collection of individual memorials that portrayed a cohesive and unified visual character. Perhaps because of this visually pleasing effect when coupled with its dramatic natural setting, the cemetery proved to be highly popular with the community and its establishment costs were recovered entirely within the first year. In the years following its establishment and with the extension of the steam tramway to the site in 1890, Waverley Cemetery expanded with the acquisition of a further of land and by 1894 the cemetery had grown to its present size of bounded by Trafalgar, Boundary and St Thomas streets. It also saw the construction of a number of built elements on the site including the Caretaker's House, Cemetery Lodge, Waiting Room, Cemetery Gates, shelters, external fencing, sandstone walling and grounds terracing. Commenced in 1898 and completed by 1901, a substantial memorial to the 1798 Irish Rebellion was constructed at the cemetery. A large and imposing monument of white Carrara marble, intricately decorated with sculptures, plaques, inscriptions, medallions and mosaic and topped with a 30-foot carved cross, the monument was to be a testament to Ireland's struggle for self-government and its patriots who fought in the rebellion. Designed by John Hennessy of architectural firm Sherrin and Hennessy, the memorial is the largest monument to the rebellion in the world. Elevating it to a somewhat sacred status, the memorial contains the interred remains of the leader of the revolution movement, Michael Dwyer (d. 1825) and his wife Mary (d.1860). Originally buried at Sydney's Sandhills Cemetery (the site of today's Central railway station), the Dwyers were exhumed and reinterred at Waverley Cemetery in 1898. Attended by some 100,000 people, the relocation and interment of the Dwyers was the largest gathering of any 1798 rebellion centenary event in the world. Waverley Cemetery continued to expand throughout the 20th century, both in numbers and architectural diversity. The grand Victorian era of its establishment slowly morphed into the humbler Edwardian times which saw the introduction of cremation services to the cemetery. Its ongoing use also saw the installation of a substantial collection of funerary monuments that ranged in fashion and style, reflecting the cultural diversity and social values of the people of NSW. The Great Depression and the world wars bought further change to the cemetery and to the monuments and memorials that were being installed. Over its lifetime, Waverley Cemetery has received numerous high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world, including: Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Henry Kendall (poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Fran√ßois Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald Prize); Sir Frances Forbes (first Chief Justice of NSW); Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); William Dymock (book retailer); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); John Fingleton OBE (Australian Cricketer and \\"Bodyline\\" veteran) and Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor). Waverley Cemetery continues to be an operational burial facility today (2015). Its naturally picturesque and urban location has made it a particularly sought after and desirable cemetery and it now contains more than 100,000 burials and interments. Major coastal storms over a weekend in June 2016 led to the collapse of some 77,000m2 of fill in the gully in the centre of the cemetery. The Bondi-to-Bronte coastal walk through the cemetery was closed but has reopened, but the original route hugging the cliff face has been changed for safety concerns.Thompson, 2016 Environment & Heritage Minister Mark Speakman announced on 23 October 2016 the State Heritage Register listing of Waverley Cemetery. \\"Waverley Cemetery is the final resting place of many prominent Australians, Mr Speakman said. \\" Poets Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar...Olympic gold medal swimmer Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack and cricket batsman Victor Trumper are all buried in Waverley'. Member for Coogee Bruce Notley-Smith said the heritage listing would be warmly received by the eastern suburbs community.Daily Telegraph, 24 October 2016, p.11. In April 2017 the 1922 Sir Charles Wade memorial was restored with grant funding from the NSW government, and Waverley Council secured a community war memorial fund grant to do a conservation assessment of the 1894 Middle Head Submarine Mine Explosion Monument.Conway, Wentworth Courier, 5 April 2017, p.24.  Description  Graves at Waverley Cemetery Waverley Cemetery is uniquely positioned on an elevated urban site overlooking the Tasman Sea to the east and the Waverley townscape to the west. Spanning some 16 hectares, Waverley Cemetery retains much of its Victorian layout and geometric grid-like pattern of burials (north-south axis). Despite its suburban environment, Waverley Cemetery is dominated by its cliff top location and its expansive views to the ocean and horizon. The contrast of the natural and man-made elements combine to create a picturesque setting for the cemetery. Containing over 90,000 burials and interments, Waverley Cemetery is dominated by white marble monuments and headstones from the mid-to-late 19th century as well as a selection of later funerary furniture that demonstrate the changing social values and attitudes towards death it has experienced during its operation (1877 to present). The cemetery also contains various additions to older elements for example the Circle Garden containing interment of ashes created in a former garden area. Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments. This occurs because the cemetery occupies a valley and two adjacent ridges. Major monuments and memorials within Waverley Cemetery are situated at key points such as at the junction of main roads and pathways and other key vantage points at the edge of cemetery sections. Major monuments prominent in the landscape include the 1798 Memorial; the Governor Duff monument; the Henry Kendall monument; the Johnston family vault; the Greek Revival monument to Sir James Martin; and the Chowder Bay Monument. The 1798 Memorial has a central theme of martyrdom. The architect's brief called for \\"a monument in Irish architecture\\" to the memory of the 1798 rebels. The design was on an imposing scale calculated to make a strong impact. The design was also heavily influenced by the chairman of the organising committee Dr Charles MacCarthy (1848-1919), who was an award-winning sculptor, painter, musician and writer. The base of the memorial is wide and deep. The back wall rises above the ground and the height of the cross is . The main material is Carrara marble. The rear wall is decorated with bronze plaques and the floor has mosaic pictures of thatched cottages and round towers. Commemorations are conducted inside the memorial which effectively forms a \\"church sanctuary\\" or stage while onlookers gather on the surrounding driveways and paths. The monument was erected by Ross and Bowman (stonemasons). The memorial is located in the centre of Waverley Cemetery, facing north at the end of a main driveway.Whitaker, 2008 Another individual monument of significance is the Stuart family vault. Dating from 1914-1916 this is a surviving work from the partnership of Walter Burley Griffin, Marion Mahony Griffin and J. Burcham Clamp. James Stuart was the founding partner of Stuart Brothers, master builders. The tomb is situated on a prominent junction at the terminal point of two large retaining walls. Built of granite the vault features gothic detailing with a pyramindal roof form built from slabs of stone. Twin doors in heavy bronze face the ocean on the eastern side of the vault. These are cast with a prismatic pattern that at head height forms a double set of diamond shaped vents. The doors are flanked by polished granite tablets with gilded inscriptions to the memory of members of the Stuart family. Other detailing includes buttresses with lancet tracery and more prismatic patterning around the cornice of the vault. There is a granite urn near the entry doors. On the western wall a round ended cross is formed by the intersection of four granite blocks, which also provides ventilation for the vault.M M Griffin, W B Griffin, A J Watson, 1998; 75-76 Waverley Cemetery contains a number of early buildings, independent structures and built elements. The cemetery office, residence and amenities building are located at the entrance of the cemetery while a number of shelters are within the cemetery itself. The cemetery also contains substantial sandstone retaining walls and terracing, pathways, and remnants of sandstone road kerbing and guttering. The cemetery also retains key landscape elements including mature Norfolk Island Pines on the boundaries, Canary Island Date Palms within the cemetery and numerous remnant historic shrubs and grave plantings and more recently established garden areas. = Condition = As at 13 April 2015, historically a self-sustaining facility, funded entirely by the sale of grave plots and interments, Waverley Cemetery is in reasonable condition due to the past allocation of funds towards maintenance over the lifetime of the cemetery. In recent years, some areas of the cemetery have deteriorated. The cemetery is susceptible to damaging forces. As well as human vandalism and general age-related deterioration, the cemetery is also particularly vulnerable to environmentally-caused salt corrosion (metalwork), wind erosion (masonry) and algae and lichen growth on the headstones. Maintenance of individual grave plots is the responsibility of the family of the deceased and therefore some plots are in a more degraded condition than others. Dominated by white Carrara marble monuments of the mid-to-late 19th century, alternative materials have been introduced to Waverley Cemetery during its operation. Coloured granite (predominantly black and rose), however sparingly used, does detract from the Victorian nature of the site. The cemetery is, however, susceptible to damaging forces. As well as human vandalism and general age-related deterioration, the cemetery is also particularly vulnerable to environmentally-caused salt corrosion (metalwork), wind erosion (masonry) and algae and lichen growth on the headstones. Historical significance Grave of Henry Lawson George Freeman George and Charlotte Sargent Waverley Cemetery contains the graves of many people who shaped Australia. This includes literary figures such as Henry Lawson, (one of Australia's most famous poets), Jules Archibald, founder of The Bulletin and benefactor of the Archibald Prize, nineteenth century writer Louis Becke, nineteenth century Australian boxing champion Larry Foley, nineteenth century poet Henry Kendall, the American actor William E. Sheridan,An Actor's Grave. Saint Paul Daily Globe, 30 October 1887, p. 13 accessed 5.18.13 poet and author Dorothea Mackellar, and author Ethel Pedley. Other significant figures include aeronautical pioneer Lawrence Hargrave, Olympic swimmer Fanny Durack, and New South Wales Premier Sir James Martin, (whose remains were transferred to Waverley Cemetery after the death of his wife in 1909). The cemetery contains over 200 war graves from various past conflicts, of which there are 132 registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (over 100 from World War I and nearly 20 from World War II). The front gates are a memorial to the residents of the area who died during World War I and World War II . Inside the main gates is a memorial to the military forces of NSW which houses the remains of several officers killed in an 1891 sea mine explosion at Middle Head. At least eleven United States Civil War veterans are also buried at Waverley, including Phineas S. Thompson. In addition, the cemetery is home to the Irish memorial, the final resting place of Michael Dwyer (1798 Rebellion), and a memorial to all those who died in that rebellion. There is also a memorial stone commemorating the 1981 Hunger Strikers. As well as nationally famous figures the cemetery contains the graves of notable Sydney identities including Robert \\"Nosey Bob\\" Howard, the state executioner who served until 1904, rugby player Peter Burge and Sydney crime figure George Freeman. Architecturally, Waverley Cemetery is significant in that it showcases examples of Stonemasonry and funerary art dating back from the 19th century, with features (such as the gates, buildings and fencing) that due to their intact nature are considered of \\"outstanding aesthetic value\\". Included in this is a tomb designed for James Stuart and his family by the architects J. Burcham Clamp and Walter Burley Griffin.  Heritage listing  Waverley Cemetery is listed as a heritage item in the Waverley Council Local Environment Plan. In 2015 local resident action group Residents for Waverley Cemetery nominated the cemetery for inclusion on the State Heritage Register. The nomination was recommended by the Heritage Council and after receiving Ministerial approval was gazetted on 28 October 2016. In 2016 Waverley Council nominated Waverley Cemetery for inclusion on the National Heritage list. As at 13 August 2015, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a general public Victorian-era cemetery that is the final resting place for more than 100,000 people. Sited in an urban setting, against a dramatic natural landscape of the Pacific Ocean with its steep cliffs and the endless horizon, Waverley Cemetery is a picturesque urban burial ground that contains a collection of highly intact funerary monuments and furniture dating from 1877. Its earliest elements demonstrate the moral standards and religious philosophies of the Australian community in the Victorian period and, through the continuity of the cemetery's use to the present day and the gradual introduction of alternative funerary designs and interment practices throughout the years, the cemetery demonstrates the cultural diversity and changing social values and attitudes of the Australian people towards death and its commemoration over some 140 years. The aesthetic continuity of Waverley Cemetery is largely due to the strict management of the cemetery in the early periods of its development. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of high- achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world. Some of its most famous names include Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Francoise Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald art prize); Sir James Martin (NSW Premier); Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); members of the Cavill family of famous swimmers - Arthur, Charles, Ernest and Frederick Cavill; William Dymock (book retailer); Victor Trumper (batsman from the \\"Golden Age\\" of cricket); Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); and Michael Dwyer (revolutionary leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion). As an operational general public cemetery, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its demonstration of the historic and contemporary social character of Sydney and NSW. Waverley Cemetery contains a wealth of genealogical, historical, architectural and artistic information which makes it a significant public educational resource for NSW. Internationally, the Waverley Cemetery has been reported to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world - among the likes of England's Highgate Cemetery and Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Waverley Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a general public Victorian-era cemetery that is the final resting place for more than 100,000 people. Opened in 1877, in the picturesque cemetery design of the mid-to-late 19th century, the geometric layout and early funerary monuments of Waverley Cemetery demonstrate the moral standards and religious philosophies of the Australian community in the Victorian period. Through the continuity of the cemetery's use to the present day, and the gradual introduction of alternative funerary designs and interment practices throughout the years, the cemetery demonstrates the cultural diversity and changing social values and attitudes of the Australian people towards death and its commemoration over some 140 years. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world. Operating for over a century and the final resting place for over 100,000 people, Waverley Cemetery has buried and interred a diverse selection of notable people from literary, business, arts, political and sporting backgrounds.

At least eleven United States Civil War veterans are also buried at Waverley Cemetery. Waverley Cemetery also houses the 1798 Memorial, a commemorative monument to those \\"Who dared and suffered for Ireland\\" in the rebellion led by the United Irishmen of 1798. This memorial is also final resting place of Michael Dwyer, \\"The Wicklow Chief\\" a revolutionary leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion who died in Sydney in 1825. The remains of Michael Dwyer and his wife were moved from the Devonshire Street Cemetery to Waverley Cemetery in 1898 (the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion). The 1798 Memorial commemorates subsequent events such as the Easter Rising of 1916 and the Long Kesh Hunger Strikes of 1981 (additional tablet at rear). The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic values. Sited in an urban setting, against a dramatic natural landscape of the Pacific Ocean with its steep cliffs and the endless horizon, Waverley Cemetery is a picturesque urban burial ground that contains a collection of highly intact funerary monuments and grave furniture of a refined palette (marble and stone) which demonstrates a comprehensive range of Victorian and Edwardian artistic elements. Many monuments feature statuary such as angels, cherubs, seraphs, mourning figures and occasional portrait medallions or busts; substantial pedestals topped with urns or spires; and Christian crosses. Smaller monuments such as stone desks often include carved decorations using floral relief, birds, crowns, and other symbolism. There is a consistent palette of materials throughout the site which is dominated by sandstone and white marble with inlaid lead lettering - granite, trachyte and other materials are less prominent. Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments. The cemetery retains a nineteenth century layout with many roadways still lined with sandstone kerbs, gutters and drains. The architecture and design of much of its earlier elements from the Victorian period reflect the social attitudes towards death and commemoration at the time of its construction. However the ongoing use and expansion of the cemetery has seen the gradual introduction of alternative funerary styles and fashions that reflect the cultural diversity and evolution of the people of NSW over time. Waverley Cemetery includes an unusual suite of cemetery structures including the main entry gates with iron palisade fence and sandstone pillars; the nearby sandstone office and waiting room building with associated residence and amenities buildings and a series of shelter sheds and sandstone retaining walls throughout the site. The cemetery also retains key landscape elements including mature Norfolk Island Pines on the boundaries, Canary Island Date Palms within the cemetery and numerous remnant historic shrubs and grave plantings. Major monuments and memorials within Waverley Cemetery are situated at key points such as at the junction of main roads and pathways and other key vantage points at the edge of cemetery sections. This makes these major monuments prominent items in the landscape when within the cemetery. Examples include the Irish Martyrs' Memorial; the Governor Duff monument; the Henry Kendall monument; the Johnston family vault; the Greek Revival monument to Sir James Martin; and the Chowder Bay Monument. Internationally, the Waverley Cemetery has been reported to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world - among the likes of England's Highgate Cemetery and Paris's Pere Lachaise Cemetery. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As an operational general public cemetery, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its demonstration of the historic and contemporary social character of Sydney and NSW. The fabric of the cemetery reflects the cultural and religious diversity of the Australian community since 1877 and its contemporary social significance is increased by its public accessibility and use by residents and visitors by virtue of its central metropolitan location. Prominent individuals and families are buried or interred at the cemetery and, as a genealogical resource, Waverley Cemetery is a significant educational asset for NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its educational and research potential. With its wealth of genealogical, historical, architectural and artistic information, Waverley Cemetery is a significant and readily accessible resource that is available to much of the NSW population by virtue of its central metropolitan location. The craftsmanship of the funerary monuments, demonstrated by rich examples from the Victorian, Edwardian and Inter-War eras, reflects social values and attitudes towards death and mourning in NSW since 1877. Furthermore, the array of funerary ornamentation demonstrates the changes in social fashions and taste over the decades and serve to reflect the impact of many international events on the activities of people in NSW (such as the Depression and the world wars). The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cemeteries of the same historical period are generally similar in layout, style and purpose but Waverley Cemetery is a notable example in NSW for its distinctive and picturesque setting on the Bronte cliff tops. The siting makes the cemetery both a place of remembrance as well as a passive recreational facility as part of the popular and well-known coastal walk from Bondi to the popular beaches of Bronte, Clovelly and Coogee. Once sited on the periphery of the Sydney colony, the retention of Waverley Cemetery in its now urban and desirable setting has seen the cemetery become a strikingly significant and intact open space in metropolitan Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a representative example of a burial ground that can demonstrate the principle characteristics of a general public cemetery from the Victorian period in NSW. The geometric layout and early funerary monuments of the Waverley Cemetery reflect the social values and attitudes of the Australian community towards death and commemoration in the mid-to-late 19th century. The ongoing operation of the cemetery and the gradual introduction of different styles and funerary fashions can also demonstrate the changing attitudes of the community towards funerary practices in NSW over time. Operation Waverley Cemetery and the boardwalk for the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk in 2018 The cemetery after more than 130 years of operation remains an entirely self-funded business. It has never been funded by the public purse or council ratepayers, with individual graves maintained for a fee. Where families no longer wish to maintain their ancestor's graves this has led to some significant memorials (such as those belonging to Jules Archibald and Victor Trumper) falling into disrepair. In 2002, the Waverley Council as owners of the business looked for alternative sources of revenue. These included corporate and private sponsorship for grave sites, and a proposed crematorium. This sponsorship plan met with limited success, although some graves have been restored with the assistance of sponsors ‚Äì including Jules Archibald's (by The Bulletin), Lawrence Hargrave's through the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the grave of Henry Lawson which was restored through a $10,000 grant by the State government. The plan to incorporate an on-site cremation into the existing business encountered vocal opposition, including by Liberal Party MP Malcolm Turnbull, the Federal Member for Wentworth, who spoke in Federal Parliament against the plan. The community opposition led to the plan being canceled in 2004. A two million dollar boardwalk designed to move joggers and others passersby away from the graves is now a popular part of the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk. In late 2007, the National Trust ran an online competition to determine the distribution of $185,000 in funding. Of the nine finalists, the Waverley Cemetery's ceremonial gates proved to be the most popular, winning the majority of the votes. Unfortunately, the amount voted to the project was only a little over 25% of the total restoration costs. Waverley Council has committed to funding the balance and work on this project is commencing in 2016. Cultural influences The earliest known motion picture filmed at the cemetery was the 1977 Italian production 'La Ragazza dal pigiama giallo', also known as 'The Pyjama Girl Case', a murder story based on the true story of Linda Agostini, the Pyjama Girl. In 1972 the cemetery was featured in filming for Spyforce where Colonel Cato played by Redmond Phillips was supposedly buried. In 1978 the cemetery was a location in filming of the movie Newsfront starring Bill Hunter and Bryan Brown. In 1979 the cemetery was a location in filming of the movie Tim starring Mel Gibson. Baywatch used the cemetery while filming its Australian movie length episode, and the Australian soap opera Home and Away buried one of their characters at Waverley in 2004. In 1996, scenes from the season one final of Australian TV show Water Rats were filmed at the cemetery. Notable recent films include Dirty Deeds. It was also pictured in the Bollywood Blockbuster Dil Chahta Hai in a musical sequence. The cemetery has been a place of inspiration for many artists, Henry Lawson who ultimately ended up there was fond of using the location in his stories, either as direct reference or indirectly. A panorama of the cemetery. South Head Cemetery South Head Cemetery is situated at the junction of New South Head Road and Old South Head Road, Vaucluse. It is administered by Waverley Council and is a companion cemetery to Waverley Cemetery. The cemetery was established to cater for the needs of the population in the growing Vaucluse area; its first interment was in 1868. It was run for some time by a private trust, but management was transferred to Waverley Council in 1941. It covers an expanse of and contains the graves of 6,000 people as of 2008. South Head General Cemetery contains the graves of many notable people, including: Australia's first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton (1920); NSW Governors Sir Walter Davidson (1923) and Sir Roden Cutler (2002); NSW Premiers Sir John Robertson (1891), Sir William Lyne (1913), Sir Charles Wade (1922) and Sir Joseph Carruthers (1932); Queensland Premier and Federal Treasurer ‚ÄúRed Ted‚Äù Theodore (1950); members of the Packer, Fairfax and Norton newspaper dynasties; members of the Street family legal dynasty including two Chief Justices, Sir Philip Whistler Street (1938) and Sir Kenneth Whistler Street (1972); Anglican Archbishop of Sydney John Charles Wright (1933); the Foy retailing family (including a monument to the disappeared Foy heiress Juanita Nielsen); architects Mortimer Lewis (1879), John Horbury Hunt (1904), Robin Dods (1920), Howard Joseland (1930), John Burcham Clamp (1931) and Neville Gruzman (2005); artist George Washington Lambert (1930); writers Jack Moses (1945) and Frank Clune (1971); entertainer Gladys Moncrieff (1976) and founder of the acting dynasty Roy Redgrave (1922); cricketer Warwick Armstrong; and Edmund Resch junior of the Resch's brewing family (1963). The cemetery contains the graves of 22 of the 40 victims of the 1927 Greycliffe ferry disaster. There are also Commonwealth war graves of 18 Australian service personnel, 5 of World War I and 13 of World War II, in various parts of the cemetery.

India is an ethnically and religiously diverse country. Given this diversity, it is difficult to generalize widely about the folklore of India as a unit. Although India is a Hindu-majority country, with more than three-fourths of the population identifying themselves as Hindus, there is no single, unified, and all-pervading concept of identity present in it. Various heterogeneous traditions, numerous regional cultures and different religions to grow and flourish here. Folk religion in Hinduism may explain the rationale behind local religious practices, and contain local myths that explain the customs or rituals. However, folklore goes beyond religious or supernatural beliefs and practices, and encompasses the entire body of social tradition whose chief vehicle of transmission is oral or outside institutional channels.  Folk art of India  The folk and tribal arts of India speak volumes about the country's rich heritage. Art forms in India have been exquisite and explicit. Folk art forms include various schools of art like the Mughal School, Rajasthani School, Nakashi art School etc. Each school has its distinct style of colour combinations or figures and its features. Other popular folk art forms include Madhubani paintings from Bihar, Kangra painting from Himachal Pradesh and Warli paintings from Maharashtra. Tanjore paintings from South India incorporate real gold into their paintings. Local fairs, festivals, deities and heroes (warriors) play a vital role in this art form. The culture of India has been broken down into five main geographical regions Some famous folk and tribal arts of India include: *Tanjore Art *Madhubani Painting *Nirmal paintings *Warli Folk Painting *Pattachitra Painting *Rajasthani Miniature Painting *Kalamezhuthu  Folktales of India  Thirayattam- (Karumakan Vallattu) India possesses a large body of heroic ballads and epic poetry preserved in oral tradition, both in Sanskrit and the various vernacular languages of India. One such oral epic, telling the story of Pabuji, has been collected by Dr. John Smith from Rajasthan; it is a long poem in the Rajasthani language, traditionally told by professional story tellers, known as Bhopas, who deliver it in front of a tapestry that depicts the characters of the story, and functions as a portable temple, accompanied by a ravanhattho fiddle. The title character was a historical figure, a Rajput prince, who has been deified in Rajasthan. Various performing arts such as Garba and Dandiya Raas of Gujarat, Sambalpuri dance of Odisha, Chhau, Alkap and Gambhira of West Bengal, Bihu of Assam, Ghoomar of Rajasthan and Haryana, Bhangra and Gidda of Punjab, Dhangar of Goa, Panthi of Chhattisgarh, Kolattam of Andhra Pradesh, Yakshagana of Karnataka, Thirayattam of Kerala \\"Thirayattam\\" (Folklore Text -malayalam), Bhasha Institute, Keralam - and Chang Lo of Nagaland derive their elements from myriads of myths, folktales and seasonal changes. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are the two greatest and most widely read epics of India. Other noteworthy collections of Indian traditional stories include the Panchatantra, a collection of traditional narratives made by Vishnu Sarma in the second century BC. The Hitopadesha of Narayana is a collection of anthropomorphic fabliaux, animal fables, in Sanskrit, compiled in the ninth century. Indian folklorists during the last thirty years have substantially contributed to the study of folklore. Devendra Satyarthi, Krishna Dev Upadyhayaya, Prafulla Dutta Goswami, Kunja Bihari Dash, Ashutosh Bhatacharya and many more senior folklorists have contributed for the study of folklore. But it is during the 1970s that some folklorists studied in US universities and trained up themselves with the modern theories and methods of folklore research and set a new trend of folklore study in India. Especially, South Indian universities advocated for folklore as a discipline in the universities and hundreds of scholars trained up on folklore. A.K. Ramanjuan was the noted folklorist to analyse folklore from Indian context. Study of folklore was strengthened by two stremas (sicsic); one is Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko and another is Peter J. Claus of American folklore. These two folklorists conducted their field work on Epic of Siri and led the Indian folklorists to the new folklore study. The Central Institute of Indian Languages has played a major role in promoting folklore studies in India to explore another reality of Indian culture. Recently scholars such as Chitrasen Pasayat, M. D. Muthukumaraswamy, Vivek Rai, Jawaharlal Handoo, Birendranath Dutta, P. C. Pattanaik, B. Reddy, Sadhana Naithani, P. Subachary, Molly Kaushal, Shyam Sundar Mahapatra, Bhabagrahi Mishra and many new folklorists have contributed in their respective field for shaping folklore study as a strong discipline in representing the people's memory and people's voice. Recently the National Folklore Support Center in Chennai has taken the initiative to promote folklore in public domain and bridging the gap of academic domain and community domain.  Indian folk heroes, villains, and tricksters  Indian folk heroes like Rama, Krishna in Sanskrit epics and history and also in freedom movement are well known to every one. They have found a place in written literature. But in Indian cultural sub-system, Indian folk heroes are most popular. The castes and tribes of India have maintained their diversities of culture through their language and religion and customs. So in addition to national heroes, regional heroes and local folk and tribal heroes are alive in the collective memory of the people. Let's take examples of the Santhals or the Gonds. The Santhals have their culture heroes Beer Kherwal and Bidu Chandan. Gonds have their folk hero Chital Singh Chhatti. Banjara folk hero is Lakha Banjara or Raja Isalu. But not only heroes, the heroines of Indian folklore have also significant contribution in shaping the culture of India. Banjara epics are heroine-centric. These epics reflect the \\"sati\\" cult. Oral epics with heroic actions of heroes and heroines produce a \\"counter text\\", as opposed to the written texts. Therefore, the younger brother becomes hero and kill his elder brother in an oral epic, which is forbidden in classical epics. Folk heroes are some times deified and are worshipped in the village. There is a thin difference of a mythic hero and romantic hero in Indian folklore. In Kalahandi, oral epics are available among the ethnic singers, performed in ritual context and social context. Dr Mahendra Mishra, a folklorist, has conducted research on oral epics in Kalahandi, taking seven ethnic groups. Dr. Chitrasen Pasayat has made an extensive study of different folk and tribal forms of Yatra, like Dhanu yatra, Kandhen-budhi yatra, Chuda-khai yatra, Sulia yatra, Patkhanda yatra, Budha- dangar yatra, Khandabasa yatra, Chhatar yatra, Sital-sasthi yatra and examined the 'hero characters' of the local deities. Indian oral epics are found abundantly everywhere there are caste based culture.

You hear about these from the times of the Mahabharata and the Mughal empire. Some of the popular board games that originated from Indian Traditional games include Chess (Chaturanga), Ludo (Pachisi) and Snakes and Ladders (Moksha-Patamu). Recently, Odisha, a state in eastern India, introduced a child-friendly programme called Srujan (creativity) in the primary schools. About 18 million children took part in four activities like story telling activities, traditional games, traditional art and craft and music and dance and riddles over a period of three years (2007‚Äì2010). The result is that while there are hundreds of varieties of folktales, the varieties of traditional games are limited. About three hundred traditional games both indoor and outdoor were commonly played and it was found that the traditional games contain mathematical knowledge (like counting, measurement, shapes and size, geometrical ideas and finally socialization through action). The traditional games are the best ways of teaching and learning. When these are applied in the primary schools, many teachers revealed that children know many games that the teachers have forgotten. Indoor board game like \\"Kasadi\\" ( a wooden board with 14 pits played with tamarind seed by two or more than two girls in the domestic domain) was most popular and it is still not vanished from the society. Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra, a folklorist and an educator has collected these games and has documented in video form.Besides other games in the domestic domain is the goat and the tiger and ganjifa. These were the forerunners of the card games of today. Ganjifa used to be circular painted stack of card like things which were played using certain rules.  Indian folklorists  The scientific study of Indian folklore was slow to begin: early collectors felt far freer to creatively reinterpret source material and collected their material with a view to the picturesque rather than the representative. A. K. Ramanujan's theoretical and aesthetic contributions span several disciplinary areas. Context-sensitivity is a theme that appears not only in Ramanujan's cultural essays, but also appears in his writing about Indian folklore and classic poetry. In \\"Where Mirrors are Windows,\\" (1989) and in \\"Three Hundred Ramayanas\\" (1991), for example, he discusses the \\"intertextual\\" nature of Indian literature, written and oral...He says, \\"What is merely suggested in one poem may become central in a 'repetition' or an 'imitation' of it. His essay \\"Where Mirrors Are Windows: Toward an Anthology of Reflections\\" (1989), and his commentaries in The Interior Landscape: Love Poems from a Classical Tamil Anthology (1967) and Folktales from India, Oral Tales from Twenty Indian Languages (1991) are good examples of his work in Indian folklore studies. Rudyard Kipling was interested in folklore, dealing with English folklore in works such as Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies; his experiences in India led him to also create similar works with Indian themes. Kipling spent a great deal of his life in India and was familiar with the Hindi language. His works such as the two Jungle Books contain a lot of stories that are written after the manner of traditional folktales. Indian themes also appear in his Just So Stories, and many of the characters bear recognisable names from Indian languages. During the same period, Helen Bannerman penned the now notorious Indian-themed tale of Little Black Sambo, which represented itself to be an Indian folktale. After independence, disciplines and methods from anthropology began to be used in the creation of more in-depth surveys of Indian folklore. Folklorists of India can be broadly divided into three phases. Phase I was the British Administrators who collected the local knowledge and folklore to understand the subjects they want to rule. next were the missionaries who wanted to acquire the language of the people to recreate their religious literature for evangelical purpose. The third phase was the post-independent period in the country where many universities, institutes and individuals started studying the folklore. the purpose was to search the national identity through legends, myths, and epics. In the course of time, Academic institutions and universities in the country started opening departments on folklore in their respective regions, more in south India to maintain their cultural identity and also maintain language and culture. After independence, scholars like Dr Satyendra, Devendra Satyarthi, Krishnadev Upadhayaya, Jhaberchand Meghani, Prafulla Dutta Goswami, Ashutosh Bhattacharya, Kunja Bihari Dash, Chitrasen Pasayat, Somnath Dhar, Ramgarib Choubey, Jagadish Chandra Trigunayan and many more were the pioneer in working on folklore. Of course, the trend was more literary than analytical. It was during the 1980s that the central Institute of Indian Languages and the American Institute of Indian Studies started their systemic study on Folklore any after that many western, as well as eastern scholars, pursued their studies on folklore as a discipline. The pioneer of the folklorists in contemporary India is Jawaharlal Handoo, Sadhana Naithani, Kishore Bhattacharjee, Kailash Patnaik, VA Vivek Rai, late Komal Kothari, Raghavan Payanad, M Ramakrishnan, Nandini Sahu and many more. An emerging trend of new folklorists has emerged who are committed to understanding folklore from an Indian point of view than to see the whole subjects from the western model. Some of them are better to prefer to understand folklore from the folklore provider and consultants who are the creator and consumers of folklore. The user of folklore knows what folklore is since their use folklore with purpose and meaning. But theoreticians see folklore from their theoretical angle. Ethics point of view, folklorist should learn from the folk as practicable as possible and folk should give the hidden meaning of folklore to the folklorist so that both of their interpretation can help to give a new meaning to the item of folklore and explore the possibility of use of folklore in the new socio-cultural domain. Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra from Kalahandi, Odisha has substantially contributed to the tribal folklore of Middle Indian and Odisha. His seminal book Oral Epics of Kalahandi has been translated into Chinses, and Finnish language. HE has written Saora folk literature, Paharia Folkliterature, Visioning Folklore, Oral Poetry of Kalahandi. HIs recent seminal work is three oral Ramakatha in tribal oral tradition. Dr MIShra has written 5 books on Folklore Theory and Research methodology adopting the folklore of western Odisha and Chhattisgarh. TEh analytical work of Dr MIShra has been widely studied in the western and eastern world as a part of South Asian folklore. Now the National Folklore support Center, Chennai since the last ten years has created a space for the new scholars who are pursuing the study of folklore with their commitment. One important breakthrough in the field of folklore is that it is no more confined to the study in the four walls of academic domain, rather, it has again found its space within and among the folk to get their true meaning. Dr.Raghavanvpayyanad is a major role in Indian folklore study he has written so many books about folklore, he is also an international face of Indian folkloristics both in English and Malayalam.  Folk songs and folk music  India has a rich and varied tradition of folk music and numerous types of folk songs. Some traditional folk song genres have been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritage listed by UNESCO. Among these traditions, a well-known musical and religious repertoire is known as Baul, which has become famous in the World Music scene. Among the most respected historical figures of the Baul tradition, Lalon Fakir and Bhaba Pagla are often mentioned.

Ferdinand Wythe Peck (1848-1924) was a wealthy Chicago, Illinois, businessman and philanthropist, best known for financing Chicago's Auditorium Building. He was the youngest son of Mary Kent Peck and Phillip F.W. Peck. The family moved from Rhode Island to Chicago in the 1830s and made a fortune in real estate. Peck and his brothers took over the family fortune when their father died, and soon were among the wealthiest families in Chicago. Ferdinand was a civic- minded individual, and was involved in many projects around the city. He was a founding member of the Illinois humane society, and served on the city board of education. He was also a patron of the arts, particularly concerned with making high art available to the working classes. To this end, he organized the Chicago Grand Opera Festival in 1885. Out of the Festival grew a desire for a more permanent expression of his ideals. Shortly after the Haymarket Square riot, he began planning in earnest for what would become the Auditorium Building. To make his idea real, Peck hired architects Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan, who had worked for him previously to prepare the space for the Grand Opera Festival. Peck provided much of the funding and the central vision for the building, and the final design reflected his ideas as well as those of the architects. Peck served as the Commissioner-General for the United States at the Paris Exposition, 1900.https://www.jstor.org/stable/25119123?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents Article by Peck on Exposition There is currently an elementary school in southwest Chicago, at 3826 West 58th Street, named after him.

It is within the local government area of Dubbo Regional Council. The town is from Sydney on the Great Western Highway and Mitchell Highway. History The area was originally occupied by the Wiradjuri people. Explorer John Oxley was the first European to find the area in 1817 and named it \\"Wellington Valley\\" after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Wellington was originally established in February 1823 by Lieutenant Percy Simpson as an convict settlement. Squatters started settling along the Macquarie Valley and in 1832 CMS was established in the settlement to teach Christianity to the Aboriginal people of the area. The convict settlement ceased in 1831 but in 1840, a village called Montefiores was established on the north side of the Macquarie River crossing. The Town of Wellington was gazetted in 1846, and on 20 March 1885, Wellington was proclaimed a town. Wellington Shire Council was established in 1949. Wellington is the second oldest New South Wales settlement west of the Blue Mountains. One of its hotels, the Lion of Waterloo, established by Nicolas Hyeronimus in 1842, is the oldest operating west of the Blue Mountains. The Lion of Waterloo is near the location of the last recorded duel fought on Australian soil in 1854. The extension of the railway from Orange to Wellington opened on 1 June 1880. As a regional centre Wellington benefited by the development of the gold mining industry in the district from the 1850s. Initially this was working alluvial deposits of gold but later focused on the mining of quartz reefs. Among the mining districts was Mitchells Creek located 8 miles to the north east near the locality of Bodangora.Osborne, Idle 1975 Annual Report Compilation, Wellington Division ‚Äì Dubbo Sheet 1875-1974, Department of Mines NSW, ARC080.

While alfalfa and vegetables are grown on lands on the river, wheat, wool, lambs and beef cattle are grown on surrounding pastures. The town acts as a commercial centre for the surrounding district. In September 2008, the Wellington Correctional Centre was opened. A Probation and Parole Office was also opened in the centre of town. Wellington Council hopes this will stimulate economic growth in the area, due to increasing employment opportunities and the need for non-locals to utilise Wellington facilities.

Its name comes from an Aboriginal word for ‚Äúrising sun,‚Äù ‚Äúlong spring,‚Äù or ‚Äúwater hole.‚Äùhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Moree Moree is a major agricultural centre, noted for its part in the Australian cotton-growing industry which was established there in the early 1960s. The town is located at the junction of the Newell Highway and Gwydir Highway and can be reached by daily train and air services from Sydney. It is situated in the Moree Plains Shire. At the 2016 census, the town of Moree had a population of 7,383. Moree is home to artesian hot spring baths which are famous for their reputed healing qualities.Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Reader's Digest (Australia) Pty. Limited, Surry Hills N.S.W., 1993, History The Weraerai and Kamilaroi peoples, whose descendants are still in the town, were the early inhabitants of the area. Major Thomas Mitchell went to the district at the request of the acting governor after the recapture of escaped convict George Clarke who told of a great river called the Kindur in 1832. Clarke had been living in the area to the south with the Kamilaroi from 1826-1831. Squatters soon followed in Mitchell's wake establishing pastoral runs, among which was 'Moree' (1844), from a Kamilaroi term believed to mean either 'long waterhole' or 'rising sun'. In 1851 James and Mary Brand arrived and built a general store on the banks of the river in 1852. A post office was added the following year. The family sold up and moved to the Hunter Region in 1857 but James died in 1858 leaving Mary with six children so she returned opened another business and in 1861 she opened the town's first inn. Moree was gazetted as a town in 1862 with land sales proceeding that year. A court of petty sessions was established in 1863, and there was a severe flood in 1864. The first constable arrived and a police station was set up in 1865. The first church (Wesleyan) was built in 1867 when the town had a population of 43. As closer settlement proceeded agriculture emerged as a thriving industry on the fertile flood plains. Banking began in 1876 and the first local newspaper was set up in 1881, at which time the population was 295. The town became a municipality in 1890. During 1894 construction of the heritage listed Federation-style lands office commenced and ended that years with the completion of the ground floor. The second storey was added in 1903. In 1895 the Great Artesian Basin which sits under Moree was tapped and yields over thirteen megalitres of water every day. The bore was sunk to deep in order to provide water for agricultural pursuits but was proved unsuitable for this purpose. The railway line and service from Sydney arrived in 1897. Wheat cultivation increased after World War II with a flour mill built at Moree in 1951 and the first commercial pecan nut farm was established on the Gwydir Highway east of Moree in 1966. The Trawalla Pecan Nut Farm is the largest pecan nut farm in the southern hemisphere, growing about 75,000 trees. In 1994 the Gwydir Olive Grove Company was established when two Moree families started producing olive oil from olives grown in the area.Tourism Moree, Moree,2007/2008 Moree was one of the destinations of the famous 1965 Freedom Bus ride, an historic trip through northern NSW led by Charles Perkins to bring media attention to discrimination against indigenous Australians. It brought racial segregation in rural Australia to the attention of urban Australians, in particular at the Moree Baths and Swimming Pool as well as pubs and theatres, where Aborigines were refused entry. At the Moree swimming pool, after a confrontation with the council and pool management, it was agreed that indigenous children could swim in the pool outside school hours. In 2007 the Moree Plains Council announced plans for a $14m upgrade to the hot thermal baths. Floods have affected parts of Moree in 1955, 1971, 1976, 2011 and 2012 although much of the populated areas were and remain flood free.

Typical of humid subtropical climates rainfall is more common in summer than in winter. =Flooding= In January 1910 floods in the Moree district caused numerous washouts of the railway to Moree. An unknown number of livestock were drowned, and at least four people drowned in the Moree area. In January 1946 a flood cut the township in two, and several hundred homes were flooded. The flood waters affected the local power station which caused a blackout. The floods also damaged roads and railway lines in the region. The Gwydir River bridge at Moree was also damaged. In February 1955 the highest recorded major flood affected Moree, with a record flood peak of 10.85 metres. Most of the central business district of the town and 800 homes were flooded. In February 1971 a major flood affected the town, with a flood peak of 10.35 m. Four hundred people were evacuated and the township was isolated for two weeks. In February 1976, another major flood hit Moree, with a flood peak of 10.60 metres. Nearly three quarters of the buildings in north Moree either had floodwater surrounding them or water in them, which included the central business district. In February 2001, another major flood peak was recorded in Moree. There were a few houses with over floor flooding. Before the flood, nearly fell at Moree Airport within 48 hours. In November 2011, major flooding flooded parts of Moree, with a peak of 10.21 metres. People were urged to evacuate from parts of north Moree and houses were flooded. Nearly of rain was recorded over 72 hours with falling in the final 24 hours of rainfall. Moree and numerous other shires were declared natural disaster zones. In February 2012, major flooding again occurred in Moree. Peaking just 10 centimetres above the February 1976 floods at 10.69 metres, the floods inundated hundreds of houses in and around Moree. the floods were the second highest ever recorded in Moree. Nearly the whole of north Moree had water in the streets with just a few still out. The whole of north Moree was told to evacuate the day before the flood peak including the nearby villages of Yarraman, Gwydirfield, Bendygleet, Pallamallawa and Biniguy. Some of the lower parts of south Moree became inundated with flooding. All of north Moree were urged to evacuate as it was expected then to be the worst flooding in 35 years. No fatalities were recorded. Nearly of rain was recorded at the Moree Meteorological Station in the 72 hours before the flood.

He wrote influential works on economics, mathematics, physics, astrology and astronomy, philosophy, and theology; was Bishop of Lisieux, a translator, a counselor of King Charles V of France, and one of the most original thinkers of 14th-century Europe. Life Nicole Oresme was born c. 1320‚Äì1325 in the village of Allemagnes (today's Fleury-sur-Orne) in the vicinity of Caen, Normandy, in the diocese of Bayeux. Practically nothing is known concerning his family. The fact that Oresme attended the royally sponsored and subsidised College of Navarre, an institution for students too poor to pay their expenses while studying at the University of Paris, makes it probable that he came from a peasant family.Edward Grant, ed., De proportionibus proportionum and Ad pauca respicientes, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Pr., 1966), p. 4. Oresme studied the \\"arts\\" in Paris, together with Jean Buridan (the so-called founder of the French school of natural philosophy), Albert of Saxony and perhaps Marsilius of Inghen, and there received the Magister Artium. He was already a regent master in arts by 1342, during the crisis over William of Ockham's natural philosophy.William J. Courtenay, The Early Career of Nicole Oresme, Isis, Vol. 91, No.3 (Sept., 2000), pp 542‚Äì548. In 1348, he was a student of theology in Paris. In 1356, he received his doctorate and in the same year he became grand master (grand- ma√Ætre) of the College of Navarre. In 1364, he was appointed dean of the Cathedral of Rouen. Around 1369, he began a series of translations of Aristotelian works at the request of Charles V, who granted him a pension in 1371 and, with royal support, was appointed bishop of Lisieux in 1377. In 1382, he died in Lisieux.Edward Grant, ed., De proportionibus proportionum and Ad pauca respicientes, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Pr., 1966), pp. 4‚Äì10. Scientific work =Cosmology= A page from Oresme's Livre du ciel et du monde, 1377, showing the celestial spheres In his Livre du ciel et du monde Oresme discussed a range of evidence for and against the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis.Edward Grant, The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 114‚Äì16. From astronomical considerations, he maintained that if the Earth were moving and not the celestial spheres, all the movements that we see in the heavens that are computed by the astronomers would appear exactly the same as if the spheres were rotating around the Earth. He rejected the physical argument that if the Earth were moving the air would be left behind causing a great wind from east to west. In his view the Earth, Water, and Air would all share the same motion.Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, pp. 521‚Äì3 As to the scriptural passage that speaks of the motion of the Sun, he concludes that \\"this passage conforms to the customary usage of popular speech\\" and is not to be taken literally.Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, p. 531 He also noted that it would be more economical for the small Earth to rotate on its axis than the immense sphere of the stars.Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, p. 535 Nonetheless, he concluded that none of these arguments were conclusive and \\"everyone maintains, and I think myself, that the heavens do move and not the Earth.\\"Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, p. 537 =Critiques of astrology= In his mathematical work, Oresme developed the notion of incommensurate fractions, fractions that could not be expressed as powers of one another, and made probabilistic, statistical arguments as to their relative frequency.James Franklin, The Science of Conjecture, Evidence and Probability before Pascal (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), (see chapter 6, pp.140 - 145) From this, he argued that it was very probable that the length of the day and the year were incommensurate (irrational), as indeed were the periods of the motions of the moon and the planets. From this, he noted that planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way. Oresme maintained that this disproves the claims of astrologers who, thinking \\"they know with punctual exactness the motions, aspects, conjunctions and oppositions‚Ä¶ [judge] rashly and erroneously about future events.\\"Oresme, Ad pauca respicientes, p. 383. Oresme's critique of astrology in his Livre de divinacions treats it as having six parts. The first, essentially astronomy, the movements of heavenly bodies, he considers good science but not precisely knowable. The second part deals with the influences of the heavenly bodies on earthly events at all scales. Oresme does not deny such influence, but states, in line with a commonly held opinion,Wood, 1970. p. 9 that it could either be that arrangements of heavenly bodies signify events, purely symbolically, or that they actually cause such events, deterministically. Mediaevalist Chauncey Wood remarks that this major elision \\"makes it very difficult to determine who believed what about astrology\\". The third part concerns predictiveness, covering events at three different scales: great events such as plagues, famines, floods and wars; weather, winds and storms; and medicine, with influences on the humours, the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected, though he accepts that prediction is a legitimate area of study, and argues that the effect on the weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers are better at predicting weather than astrologers, and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction, noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars (because of precession of the equinoxes) since the zodiac was first described in ancient times. These first three parts are what Oresme considers the physical influences of the stars and planets (including sun and moon) on the earth, and while he offers critiques of them, he accepts that effects exist. The last three parts are what Oresme considers to concern (good or bad) fortune. They are interrogations, meaning asking the stars when to do things such as business deals; elections, meaning choosing the best time to do things such as getting married or fighting a war; and nativities, meaning the natal astrology with birth charts that forms much of modern astrological practice. Oresme classifies interrogations and elections as \\"totally false\\" arts, but his critique of nativities is more measured. He denies that any path is predetermined by the heavenly bodies, because humans have free will, but he accepts that the heavenly bodies can influence behaviour and habitual mood, via the combination of humours in each person. Overall, Oresme's skepticism is strongly shaped by his understanding of the scope of astrology. He accepts things a modern skeptic would reject, and rejects some things ‚Äî such as the knowability of planetary movements, and effects on weather ‚Äî that are accepted by modern science.Wood, 1970. pp. 8‚Äì11 =Sense perception= In discussing the propagation of light and sound, Oresme adopted the common medieval doctrine of the multiplication of species,Bert Hansen, Nicole Oresme and the Marvels of Nature (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1985), pp. 89-90. as it had been developed by optical writers such as Alhacen, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, John Pecham, and Witelo.David C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 78‚Äì80, 98, 113‚Äì16. Oresme maintained that these species were immaterial, but corporeal (i.e., three-dimensional) entities.Peter Marshall, \\"Nicole Oresme on the Nature, Reflection, and Speed of Light,\\" Isis, 72 (1981): 357‚Äì374, pp. 360‚Äì2. =Mathematics= Oresme's most important contributions to mathematics are contained in Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the intensio (the degree of heat at each point) and the extensio (as the length of the heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call rectangular co-ordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness, whiteness, and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed, the longitudo represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled. He shows that his method of figuring the latitude of forms is applicable to the movement of a point, on condition that the time is taken as longitude and the speed as latitude; quantity is, then, the space covered in a given time. In virtue of this transposition, the theorem of the latitudo uniformiter difformis became the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion; thus Oresme published what was taught over two centuries prior to Galileo's making it famous.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Nicole Oresme\\" Diagrams of the velocity of an accelerating object against time in On the Latitude of Forms by Oresme have been cited to credit Oresme with the discovery of \\"proto bar charts\\". Significantly, Oresme developed the first proof of the divergence of the harmonic series. His proof, requiring less advanced mathematics than current \\"standard\\" tests for divergence (for example, the integral test), begins by noting that for any n that is a power of 2, there are n/2 - 1 terms in the series between 1/(n/2) and 1/n. Each of these terms is at least 1/n, and since there are n/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2. For instance, there is one term 1/2, then two terms 1/3+1/4 that together sum to at least 1/2, then four terms 1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8 that also sum to at least 1/2, and so on. Thus the series must be greater than the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 \\\\+ 1/2 + ..., which does not have a finite limit. This proves that the harmonic series must be divergent. This argument shows that the sum of the first n terms grows at least as fast as (1/2) \\\\log_2 n. Oresme was the first mathematician to prove this fact, and (after his proof was lost) it was not proven again until the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli. He also worked on fractional powers, and the notion of probability over infinite sequences, ideas which would not be further developed for the next three and five centuries, respectively. = On local motion = Oresme, like many of his contemporaries such as John Buridan and Albert of Saxony, shaped and critiqued Aristotle's and Averroes's theories of motion to their own liking. Taking inspiration from the theories of forma fluens and fluxus formae, Oresme would suggest his own descriptions for change and motion in his commentary of Physics. Forma fluens is described by William of Ockham as \\"Every thing that is moved is moved by a mover,\\" and fluxus formae as \\"Every motion is produced by a mover.\\" Buridan and Albert of Saxony each subscribed to the classic interpretation of flux being an innate part of an object, but Oresme differs from his contemporaries in this aspect. Oresme agrees with fluxus formae in that motion is attributed to an object, but that an object is ‚Äúset into‚Äù motion, rather than ‚Äúgiven‚Äù motion, denying a distinction between a motionless object and an object in motion. To Oresme, an object moves, but it is not a moving object. Once an object begins movement through the three dimensions it has a new ‚Äúmodus rei‚Äù or ‚Äúway of being,‚Äù which should only be described through the perspective of the moving object, rather than a distinct point. This line of thought coincides with Oresme's challenge to the structure of the universe. Oresme's description of motion was not popular, although it was thorough. A Richard Brinkley is thought to be an inspiration for the modus-rei description, but this is uncertain. = Political thought = Oresme provided the first modern vernacular translations of Aristotle's moral works that are still extant today. Between 1371 and 1377 he translated Aristotle's Ethics, Politics and Economics (the last of which is nowadays considered to be pseudo- Aristotelian) into Middle French. He also extensively commented on these texts, thereby expressing some of his political views. Like his predecessors Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne (and quite unlike Aristotle), Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government.Mario Grignaschi: Nicolas Oresme et son commentaire √† la ¬´Politique¬ª d'Aristote, in: Album Helen Maud Cam, Louvain 1960 (Studies Presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, 23), 95‚Äì151, esp. 99‚Äì106. His criterium for good government is the common good. A king (by definition good) takes care of the common good, whereas a tyrant works for his own profit. A monarch can ensure the stability and durability of his reign by letting the people participate in government. This has rather confusingly and anachronistically been called popular sovereignty.Shulamith Shahar: Nicolas Oresme, un penseur politique ind√©pendant de l'entourage du roi Charles V, in: L'information historique 32 (1970), 203‚Äì209. Like Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Auvergne and especially Marsilius of Padua, whom he occasionally quotes, Oresme conceives of this popular participation as rather restrictive: only the multitude of reasonable, wise and virtuous men should be allowed political participation by electing and correcting the prince, changing the law and passing judgement.Mario Grignaschi: Nicolas Oresme et son commentaire √† la ¬´Politique¬ª d'Aristote, in: Album Helen Maud Cam, Louvain 1960 (Studies Presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, 23), 95‚Äì151, esp. 111‚Äì112; Jacques Krynen: Aristot√©lisme et r√©forme de l'Etat, en France, au XIVe si√®cle, in: J√ºrgen Miethke (ed.): Das Publikum politischer Theorie im 14. Jahrhundert, M√ºnchen 1992 (Schriften des Historischen Kollegs, 21), 225‚Äì236, esp. 231‚Äì232; James M. Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 221‚Äì225. Oresme, however, categorically denies the right of rebellion since it endangers the common good.Susan M. Babbitt: Oresme's Livre de Politiques and the France of Charles V., in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 75,1 (1985), 1‚Äì158, esp. 83‚Äì84; Ulrich Meier: Molte revoluzioni, molte novit√†. Gesellschaftlicher Wandel im Spiegel der politischen Philosophie und im Urteil von st√§dtischen Chronisten des sp√§ten Mittelalters, in: J√ºrgen Miethke, Klaus Schreiner (eds.): Sozialer Wandel im Mittelalter. Wahrnehmungsformen, Erkl√§rungsmuster, Regelungsmechanismen, Sigmaringen 1994, 119‚Äì176, esp. 127‚Äì129. Unlike earlier commentators, however, Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the king's will.James M. Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 211‚Äì212. It must only be changed in cases of extreme necessity.Jacques Krynen: L'empire du roi. Ide√©s et croyances politiques en France. XIIIe‚ÄìXVe si√®cle, Paris 1993, 266‚Äì272. Oresme favours moderate kingship,James M. Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 203‚Äì242. thereby negating contemporary absolutist thought, usually promoted by adherents of Roman law.Jacques Krynen: L'empire du roi. Ide√©s et croyances politiques en France. XIIIe‚ÄìXVe si√®cle, Paris 1993, 110‚Äì124, 343‚Äì456. Furthermore, Oresme doesn't comply to contemporary conceptions of the French king as sacred, as promoted by √âvrart de Tr√©maugon in his Songe du vergier or Jean Golein in his Trait√© du sacre.Shulamith Shahar: Nicolas Oresme, un penseur politique ind√©pendant de l'entourage du roi Charles V, in: L'information historique 32 (1970), 203‚Äì209; Vanina Kopp: Der K√∂nig und die B√ºcher. Sammlung, Nutzung und Funktion der k√∂niglichen Bibliothek am sp√§tmittelalterlichen Hof in Frankreich, Ostfildern 2016 (Beihefte der Fancia, 80). Although he heavily criticises the Church as corrupt, tyrannical and oligarchical, he never fundamentally questions its necessity for the spiritual well-being of the faithful.Susan M. Babbitt: Oresme's Livre de Politiques and the France of Charles V., in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 75,1 (1985), 1‚Äì158, esp. 98‚Äì146. It has traditionally been thought that Oresme's Aristotelian translations had a major impact on King Charles V's politics: Charles' laws concerning the line of succession and the possibility of a regency for an underage king have been accredited to Oresme, as has the election of several high-ranking officials by the king's council in the early 1370s.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 5‚Äì43, esp. 9. Oresme may have conveyed Marsilian and conciliarist thought to Jean Gerson and Christine de Pizan.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 30; Cary J. Nederman: A Heretic Hiding in Plain Sight. The Secret History of Marsiglio of Padua's Defensor Pacis in the Thought of Nicole Oresme, in: John Christian Laursen u.a. (eds.): Heresy in Transition. Transforming Ideas of Heresy in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, London 2005 (Catholic Christendom, 1300‚Äì1700), 71‚Äì88. = Economics = With his Treatise on the origin, nature, law, and alterations of money (De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum), one of the earliest manuscripts devoted to an economic matter, Oresme brings an interesting insight on the medieval conception of money. Oresme's viewpoints of theoretical architecture are outlined in Part 3 and 4 of his work from De moneta, which he completed between 1356 and 1360. His belief is that humans have a natural right to own property; this property belongs to the individual and community. In Part 4, Oresme provides a solution to a political problem as to how a monarch can be held accountable to put the common good before any private affairs. Though the monarchy rightfully has claims on all money given an emergency, Oresme states that any ruler that goes through this is a ‚ÄúTyrant dominating slaves‚Äù. Oresme was one of the first medieval theorists that did not accept the right of the monarch to have claims on all money as well as ‚Äúhis subjects‚Äô right to own private property.‚Äù = Psychology = Oresme was known to be a well rounded psychologist. He practiced the technique of ‚Äúinner senses‚Äù and studied the perception of the world. Oresme contributed to 19th and 20th century psychology in the fields of cognitive psychology, perception psychology, psychology of consciousness, and psychophysics. Oresme discovered the psychology of unconscious and came up with the theory of unconscious conclusion of perception. He developed many ideas beyond quality, quantity, categories and terms which were labeled ‚Äútheory of cognition‚Äù.

Created and written by Kurt Busiek, the series is mostly illustrated by Brent Anderson, with character designs and painted covers by Alex Ross. The first volume was published from 1995 to 1996 by Image Comics. In 1996, a second volume was launched under the Homage Comics imprint of Image partner studio WildStorm, which was then acquired by DC Comics, where the series later transitioned to the WildStorm Signature Series imprint and continued until 2010. During this period it switched from a regular ongoing series to a sequence of periodic mini-series and special issues. A third, ongoing volume was launched under DC's Vertigo imprint in 2013 and concluded in 2018, reverting to occasional miniseries and original graphic novels. Counting all series, mini-series and special issues, over 100 issues have been published. Characters Some of the more prominent personalities of Astro City are listed below; see the article on Astro City Characters for a more complete listing. =Heroes= *Samaritan ‚Äì An extremely powerful hero. Time-traveler, appeared in this era in 1985; active as a hero since 1986. A current member of Honor Guard. Is sometimes referred to as \\"Big Red.\\" Is the first hero in the series to receive an origin story. *The Confessor ‚Äì A mysterious vigilante detective, apparently active from the 1950s to the mid-1990s. His history is a blur of myths and assumptions, as dark as his crime fighting methods. In the Confession arc from the second volume of the series, even his new sidekick struggles to know more about his mentor. *Crackerjack ‚Äì An egocentric, reckless crime-fighter, with amazing agility and a staff weapon. Active since 1991. *The Hanged Man ‚Äì A ghostly figure who protects Shadow Hill, appearing as a floating apparition with a burlap sack over his head and a noose around his neck. Active in Astro City since the 19th century; rumored to have existed since at least the Middle Ages. *M.P.H. a.k.a. The Acceleration Ace ‚Äì Super-speedster and member of Honor Guard. Besides his membership duties with Honor Guard, he operates in his home city of Detroit. *Jack-in-the-Box ‚Äì A clown-themed vigilante with no known powers but agility and an arsenal of clown and toy-inspired weaponry. *Silver Agent ‚Äì An armored vigilante who suffers a tragic fate, hinted at for years. Active from 1956 through the early 1970s, and via time travel, sporadically throughout thousands of years into the future. A founding member of Honor Guard. *Winged Victory ‚Äì A feminist Greco-Roman themed superhero, controversial due to her habit of saving women before men regardless of the situation. *Beautie ‚Äì A sophisticated android modeled on a popular doll. =Villains= *Bridwell ‚Äì An Enelsian spy gathering intelligence on Earth's heroes; enamored of humanity's better instincts, but ultimately disgusted by mankind's baser ones. *The Conquistador ‚Äì A mysterious armored villain who hired villains from Kiefer Square as part of a grand scheme to gain back lost respect. *The Deacon ‚Äì A soft-spoken lord of \\"ordinary\\" organized crime in Astro City. *Infidel ‚Äì A slave who became an immortal mystic during the Middle Ages, and traveled through time to become a tyrant in the 36th century. Infidel became the arch-enemy of Samaritan after Samaritan's heroics changed history, erasing Infidel's future empire. Essentially a mad scientist who uses alchemy and magic to warp reality. *The Junkman ‚Äì An aged villain seeking vengeance on society for age discrimination. Recycles and enhances his weaponry from discarded trash. *The Mock Turtle ‚Äì A generally docile and polite man who grew up obsessed with fantasies, especially Alice in Wonderland. He eventually became a costumed criminal, employing a weaponized armor themed after the Alice character from which he drew his name. =Groups= *The Astro City Irregulars ‚Äì A group of outcast heroes founded in the early to mid-1970s. Disbanded by the 2010s, at which time the second Goldenglove was hoping to get it going again. *The Crossbreed ‚Äì A group of religious themed heroes, consisting of Noah, Daniel, Peter, Mary, David, and Joshua. Stigmatized by society as \\"Jesus freaks.\\" *E.A.G.L.E. ‚Äì A government agency charged with dealing with super-powered and other extraordinary threats to public safety. *The Enelsians ‚Äì A matriarchal alien race that invaded Earth, with Astro City as their focal point. *The First Family ‚Äì A family of interdimensional explorers and superheroes consisting of brothers Augustus and Julius Furst, Augustus' adopted children Nick and Natalie, Natalie's dinosaur- like husband Rex, and their daughter Astra. *Honor Guard ‚Äì The most prestigious superhero group. Founded in 1959, members came and went over the years. For much of its history it maintained seven active members; more recently, the group has expanded considerably. The roster as of 2017 consists of Samaritan (leader), Assemblyman (II), Beautie, Cleopatra (II), the Gentleman, Hummingbird (II), the Living Nightmare, M.P.H., N-Forcer (latest successor of the original), Winged Victory and Wolfspider, with American Chibi on detached duty. *Pyramid ‚Äì A criminal organization with an ancient Egyptian motif, led by the Sekhmet Stone, a living mystical artifact from the past. =Civilians= *Looney Leo ‚Äì A cartoon lion brought to life in 1946, he was briefly the Gentleman's sidekick, then a media star. When his fame faded, he was homeless for a while before becoming a pawn in a supervillain's plot. Afterwards, he was a recluse before becoming host of a nostalgic nightclub bearing his name in the entertainment district. *Steeljack (Carl \\"Carlie\\" Donewicz) ‚Äì A former supervillain and member of the villain group the Terrifying Three. He is a resident of Kiefer Square who attempts to reform after serving his time. Active as a villain from about 1970 to 1978; in prison from 1978‚Äì1998. Later tapped by former associates to investigate the string of \\"Black Mask\\" murders; later became a licensed private investigator. *Charles Raymond Williams and Royal James Williams ‚Äì Brothers whose parents are killed in 1959 during a superhero battle. They grew up following very different paths with Charles becoming a police officer and Royal a petty criminal. They are the focus of The Dark Age four-book maxiseries.

Kurt Busiek was honored with 1998's Harvey and 1999's Eisner for Best Writer, in both instances for bodies of work including Astro City. Alex Ross took both awards for Best Cover Artist in 1996, 1997, and 1998, in all instances but one for Astro City or bodies of work including it (the exception was the 1997 Harvey, awarded for Kingdom Come #1). He also took 1999's Harvey and 2000's Eisner for Best Cover Artist, again for bodies of work including Astro City. Other media =Film= In 2003, Ben Barenholtz, Jonathan Alpers and Busiek hoped to develop an Astro City movie, with Barenholtz as producer and Alpers as lead scripter, but the plans did not take off, whereupon Barenholtz subsequently took the project to Working Title Films. In July 2010, it was announced that Working Title had acquired the rights to make a live-action feature film adaptation of Astro City. Busiek was to write a script treatment, and also to executive-produce, along with Barenholtz and Alpers. On May 10, 2013 Kurt Busiek reported that Working Title's option had lapsed but he was in negotiation with another party. =Television= In March 2018, FremantleMedia North America announced it will produce a live-action Astro City TV series with a pilot episode written by Busiek and Rick Alexander.

The Populares emerged as a political group with the reforms of the Gracchi brothers, who were tribunes of the plebs between 133 and 121 BC. Although the Gracchi belonged to the highest Roman aristocracy since they were the grandsons of Scipio Africanus, they were concerned for the urban poor, whose dire condition increased the risk of a social crisis at Rome. They tried to implement a vast social program comprising a grain dole, new colonies, and a redistribution of the Ager publicus in order to alleviate their situation. They also drafted laws to grant Roman citizenship to Italian allies and reform the judicial system to tackle corruption. Both brothers were murdered by their opponents, the Optimates, the conservative faction representing the interests of the landed aristocracy, which dominated the Senate. Several tribunes of the plebs later tried to pass the Gracchi's program by using plebiscites to bypass senatorial opposition, but Saturninus and Clodius Pulcher suffered the same fate as the Gracchi. Furthermore, many politicians of the late Republic postured as Populares to enhance their popularity among the plebs, notably Julius Caesar and Octavian (later Augustus), who finally enacted most of the Populares' agenda during their rule. The Populares counted a number of patricians, the most ancient Roman aristocrats, such as Appius Claudius Pulcher, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, and Julius Caesar among their number. They were allied to politicians of lesser status, especially \\"new men\\" like Gaius Marius, or Gaius Norbanus, who might have even been a new Roman citizen.

On the reverse, Mars helps a man in a toga into a biga, perhaps an allegory of the Populares' campaign for enrolling into the electoral rolls the Italians who had received the citizenship after the Social War.T. P. Wiseman, \\"The Census in the First Century B.C.\\", p. 65.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 406, 407. The plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) and the Plebeian Council (the assembly of the plebeians) at times clashed with the Senate over the mentioned reforms and over the power relationship between the plebeian institutions and the Senate. The Optimates among the senators spearheaded the senatorial opposition. These tribunes were supported by Populares politicians such as Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar, who were often patricians, or equites. Their conflicts also played a part in some of the civil wars of the Late Roman Republic: Sulla's first civil war (88‚Äì87 BC), Sulla's second civil war (82‚Äì81 BC), the Sertorian War (83‚Äì72 BC), Lepidus' rebellion (77 BC), Caesar's Civil War (49‚Äì45 BC), the post-Caesarian civil war (44‚Äì43 BC), the Liberators' civil war (44‚Äì42 BC) and the Sicilian revolt (44‚Äì36 BC). The Populares reached the height of their ascendancy four times. The first one was with the Gracchi brothers, who mobilized the plebeians in support of their land reform and their challenge to senatorial supremacy (133 BC and 122 BC). This almost was not the issue because the Populares had help from the Italians and they had to offer more land to the Italians than they wanted to. The land was meant to go to the poor.de Ligt, Luuk and Northwood, Simon J. People, Land, and Politics: Demographic Developments and the Transformation of Roman Italy 300 BC-AD 14 (2008). Leiden. Brill NV. The second time was with Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the Younger, when the Marians (the supporters of Marius, who were Populares) seized power and held Rome from 87 BC to 82 BC. They were defeated in Sulla's Second Civil War. This was caused by the deteriorating relationship between Sulla and Marius as they started to fall apart from the consul stand point and lost view of what was important. The third time was when Julius Caesar was elected as consul in 59 BC with the support of Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey, who formed an informal alliance with Caesar which historians call the First Triumvirate (60‚Äì53 BC). These three helped bring Rome back to order from the scene it was when Sulla had left. The First Triumvirate gave each of the men their own land to watch over so parts of Rome were equally distributed among themselves so none of them would have too much to rule over.Sheppard, P.

Caesar managed to pass an agrarian law for a land reform, which had not been achieved since the agrarian law of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus of 133 BC as all subsequent attempts at agrarian legislation had been thwarted by the opposition and obstructionism of the Optimates. Tensions between Populares and Optimates had increased with the Catiline conspiracy (63 BC) against the consulship of Marcus Tullius Cicero (an Optimate) during which Cicero, supported by a final decree (senatus consultum ultimum) of the Senate, had some of the conspirators executed without trial. There were demonstrations against these summary executions and this display of arbitrary senatorial power. There were two attempts to counter senatorial dominance which failed, but they were popular. The proponents were Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos Iunior, a plebeian tribune; and Julius Caesar, who at the time was a praetor.Sumner, G. V. Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus (1966).

This enhanced Caesar's popularity and was a help for his creation of the First Triumvirate three years later. The fourth time was with Caesar's Civil War, when Caesar held power from 49 BC to when he was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar relied on the support of the people for his power.Pelling, Christopher. \\"Plutarch and Roman Politics\\" in Past Perspectives: Studies in Greek and Roman Historical Writing.

From the beginning, Caesar is the champion and the favorite of the Roman demos. When they support him, he rises, but when he loses their favor he falls too.Cassius Dio (36.43.3) noted that Julius Caesar \\"courted the good-will of the multitude, observing how much stronger they were than the senate\\".Millar, Fergus.

Members  Notable Populares included men who held the plebeian tribunate such as the Gracchi brothers, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, Marcus Livius Drusus, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, Servilius Rullus and Publius Clodius Pulcher; and men who held the consulship such as Appius Claudius Pulcher, Publius Mucius Scaevola, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus (who also became a plebeian tribune), Gaius Marius, Gaius Marius the Younger, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Julius Caesar. There were other notable Populares such as Quintus Sertorius, who participated in the capture of Rome by the Marians in 87 BC and fought the Sertorian War, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Marc Antony, who fought for Caesar, were given a consulship by him and later became members of the Second Triumvirate. Although Marcus Licinius Crassus did not play a prominent part in Roman politics apart from his consulship in 70 BC, prior to being part of the First Triumvirate he was known as a supporter of the Populares.Sumner, G. V. Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus (1996). Transactions and proceedings of the American Philological Association. Vol. 97. p. 573. Pompey was also a member of the First Triumvirate. The Optimates in the Senate side-lined him and frustrated his attempts to have his settlements in the east after his victory in the Third Mithridatic War ratified and to promote an agrarian reform to redistribute land to his veterans. Pompey's attacks pushed back Mithridates and Pompey even managed to get Mithridates's son to become an ally of Rome.Mayor, Adrienne.

After the death of Crassus, Pompey drifted towards the Optimates.Boatwright, Gargola (2004). p. 244. These shifting allegiances are reminders that the designation Populares refers as much to political tactics as to any perceived policy. Holland notes that republican politicians \\"had always been more divided on issues of style than of policy\\".Holland, T. Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic (2003). London. Abacus. p. 194.  Ideology  Roma is portrayed on the obverse, while the reverse depicts the Columna Minucia, with at the top a statue of his ancestor Lucius Minucius Augurinus, who as praefectus annonae in 439 BC organised a corn distribution. This coin participates to the Popularis propaganda in favour of the grain dole.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 273‚Äì276. A historian of the Late Republic cautions against understanding the terms populares and optimates as formally organized factions with an ideological basis: This summarizes the dominant interpretation of the Populares in 20th-century scholarship, deriving in large part from Ronald Syme in the Anglophone literature. In the early 21st century and as early as the publication of the ninth volume of The Cambridge Ancient History in 1994,Andrew Lintott. \\"Political History, 146‚Äì96 B.C.\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1994). p. 52. the validity of examining Popularist ideology in the context of Roman political philosophy has been reasserted. In particular, T. P. Wiseman has rehabilitated the use of the word \\"party\\" to describe the political opposition between Optimates and Populares, based on Latin usage (partes) and pointing to the consistency of a sort of party platform based on the food supply and general welfare of the populus (\\"people\\"), making land available to those outside the senatorial elite and debt relief.Though this has been a strand in Wiseman's scholarship over the decades, see particularly the introduction and \\"Roman History and the Ideological Vacuum\\" in Remembering the Roman People: Essays on Late-Republican Politics and Literature (Oxford University Press, 2009) at p. 14 for partes and \\"party\\". A less truncated version of \\"Roman History and the Ideological Vacuum\\" may be found in Classics in Progress (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 285. Politicians adhering to Popularist rhetoric or implementing Popularist policies usually did so not out of genuine belief in the cause or out of altruism, but rather to ingratiate themselves with the masses in order to achieve their own goals or those of patrons. Julius Caesar exemplified this once he became Roman dictator, involving himself in attracting teachers and doctors and the replacement of slaves on farms (important issues to the poor), but also disbanding clubs fellow Popularist Publius Clodius Pulcher used to maintain his own infuence, seeing him as a threat to his rule. Those in the Populares tradition also tended to oppose the use of the death penalty. A true distinction between the populares and optimates usually only showed intermittently, however, mainly in relation to some contentious measure.

Ancient Roman society Populism Roman Republic ","title":"Populares"},{"id":"593678","text":"During the Roman Republic, nobilis (\\"noble\\", nobilitas, plural nobiles) was a descriptive term of social rank, usually indicating that a member of the family had achieved the consulship. Those who belonged to the hereditary patrician families were noble, but plebeians whose ancestors were consuls were also considered nobiles. The transition to nobilitas thus required the rise of a non-noble individual to the consulship, who was considered a \\"new man\\" (novus homo). Two of the most famous examples of these self-made \\"new men\\" were Gaius Marius, who held the consulship seven times, and Cicero. The Second Samnite War (326‚Äì304 BC) was a formative time in the creation of this ruling elite comprising both patricians and plebeians who had risen to power.E.T. Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 217. From the mid-4th century to the early 3rd century BC, several plebeian- patrician \\"tickets\\" for the consulship repeated joint terms, suggesting a deliberate political strategy of cooperation.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005), p. 269. Scholarly attempts to define nobilitas have led to debates over the particulars of its usage in ancient sources. Fergus Millar points out that nobilis was a descriptive word as used in the Late Republic, and not a technical term for a restricted social group in the sense of peerage. Matthias GelzerMatthias Gelzer, Die Nobilit√§t der r√∂mischen Republik (1912). held that the term was reserved for descendants of consuls, and therefore reckoned that Munatius Plancus, consul designate for 42 BC,Designated by Julius Caesar while dictator. was the last man to qualify as an ancestor for a nobilis.Matthias Gelzer, in Hermes 50 (1915) 395ff., as noted by Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy p. 51, observing that \\"the notion was peculiar and vulnerable.\\" P.A. Brunt,P.A. Brunt, \\"Nobilitas and novitas,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 72 (1982) 1‚Äì17. building on the view of Theodor Mommsen, assembled evidence of broader usage that suggests any curule office might grant the aura of nobilitas. The term is not found in the literature of the mid-Republic, and came into use long after the social and political changes that created \\"noble\\" plebeians.Fergus Millar, \\"The Political Character of the Classical Roman Republic, 200‚Äì151 B.C.,\\" as reprinted in Rome, the Greek World, and the East (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 126 online, originally published in Journal of Roman Studies 74 (1984) 1‚Äì19. During the time of Augustus, a nobilis enjoyed easier access to the consulship, with a lowered age requirement perhaps set at 32. Women who descended from Augustan consuls are also regarded as belonging to the Roman nobility.Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford University Press, 1989, 2nd ed.), pp. 50‚Äì52 online. In the usage of Tacitus and Pliny Minor,Pliny, Panegyricus Traiani 69.5: illos ingentium virorum nepotes, illos posteros libertatis (\\"those grandsons of outsized men, those descendants of liberty\\"). a nobilis is a descendant of the Republican aristocracy. The meaning of nobilis then evolved during the Imperial period. See also *Cursus honorum References Further reading * Adam Afzelius: Zur Definition der r√∂mischen Nobilit√§t in der Zeit Ciceros.

This helps to ensure that the process operates efficiently, producing more specification-conforming products with less waste (rework or scrap). SPC can be applied to any process where the \\"conforming product\\" (product meeting specifications) output can be measured. Key tools used in SPC include run charts, control charts, a focus on continuous improvement, and the design of experiments. An example of a process where SPC is applied is manufacturing lines. SPC must be practised in 2 phases: The first phase is the initial establishment of the process, and the second phase is the regular production use of the process. In the second phase, a decision of the period to be examined must be made, depending upon the change in 5M&E; conditions (Man, Machine, Material, Method, Movement, Environment) and wear rate of parts used in the manufacturing process (machine parts, jigs, and fixtures). An advantage of SPC over other methods of quality control, such as \\"inspection\\", is that it emphasizes early detection and prevention of problems, rather than the correction of problems after they have occurred. In addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product. SPC makes it less likely the finished product will need to be reworked or scrapped.  History  SPC was pioneered by Walter A. Shewhart at Bell Laboratories in the early 1920s. Shewhart developed the control chart in 1924 and the concept of a state of statistical control. Statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeabilityBarlow & Irony (1992)Bergman (2009) developed by logician William Ernest Johnson also in 1924 in his book Logic, Part III: The Logical Foundations of Science.Zabell (1992) Along with a team at AT&T; that included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig he worked to put sampling inspection on a rational statistical basis as well. Shewhart consulted with Colonel Leslie E. Simon in the application of control charts to munitions manufacture at the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in 1934. That successful application helped convince Army Ordnance to engage AT&T;'s George Edwards to consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and contractors at the outbreak of World War II. W. Edwards Deming invited Shewhart to speak at the Graduate School of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and served as the editor of Shewhart's book Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control (1939) which was the result of that lecture. Deming was an important architect of the quality control short courses that trained American industry in the new techniques during WWII. The graduates of these wartime courses formed a new professional society in 1945, the American Society for Quality Control, which elected Edwards as its first president. Deming travelled to Japan during the Allied Occupation and met with the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) in an effort to introduce SPC methods to Japanese industry .Deming, W. Edwards, Lectures on statistical control of quality., Nippon Kagaku Gijutsu Remmei, 1950Deming, W. Edwards and Dowd S. John (translator) Lecture to Japanese Management, Deming Electronic Network Web Site, 1950 (from a Japanese transcript of a lecture by Deming to \\"80% of Japanese top management\\" given at the Hotel de Yama at Mr. Hakone in August 1950) ='Common' and 'special' sources of variation= Shewhart read the new statistical theories coming out of Britain, especially the work of William Sealy Gosset, Karl Pearson, and Ronald Fisher. However, he understood that data from physical processes seldom produced a normal distribution curve (that is, a Gaussian distribution or 'bell curve'). He discovered that data from measurements of variation in manufacturing did not always behave the way as data from measurements of natural phenomena (for example, Brownian motion of particles). Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display variation that is natural to the process (\\"common\\" sources of variation); these processes he described as being in (statistical) control. Other processes additionally display variation that is not present in the causal system of the process at all times (\\"special\\" sources of variation), which Shewhart described as not in control. =Application to non-manufacturing processes= In 1988, the Software Engineering Institute suggested that SPC could be applied to non-manufacturing processes, such as software engineering processes, in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The Level 4 and Level 5 practices of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) use this concept. The application of SPC to non-repetitive, knowledge-intensive processes, such as research and development or systems engineering, has encountered skepticism and remains controversial.Bob Raczynski and Bill Curtis (2008) Software Data Violate SPC's Underlying Assumptions, IEEE Software, May/June 2008, Vol. 25, No. 3, pp. 49-51Robert V. Binder (1997) Can a Manufacturing Quality Model Work for Software?, IEEE Software, September/October 1997, pp. 101-105 In his seminal article No Silver Bullet, Fred Brooks points out that the complexity, conformance requirements, changeability, and invisibility of softwareFred P. Brooks (1986) No Silver Bullet ‚Äî Essence and Accident in Software Engineering, Proceedings of the IFIP Tenth World Computing Conference 1986, pp. 1069‚Äì1076 results in inherent and essential variation that cannot be removed. This implies that SPC is less effective in the domain of software development than in, e.g., manufacturing. Variation in manufacturing In manufacturing, quality is defined as conformance to specification. However, no two products or characteristics are ever exactly the same, because any process contains many sources of variability. In mass-manufacturing, traditionally, the quality of a finished article is ensured by post-manufacturing inspection of the product. Each article (or a sample of articles from a production lot) may be accepted or rejected according to how well it meets its design specifications. In contras, SPC uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to detect significant variations before they result in the production of a sub-standard article. Any source of variation at any point of time in a process will fall into one of two classes. ;(1) Common causes: 'Common' causes are sometimes referred to as 'non-assignable', or 'normal' sources of variation. It refers to any source of variation that consistently acts on process, of which there are typically many. This type of causes collectively produce a statistically stable and repeatable distribution over time. ;(2) Special causes: 'Special' causes are sometimes referred to as 'assignable' sources of variation. The term refers to any factor causing variation that affects only some of the process output. They are often intermittent and unpredictable. Most processes have many sources of variation; most of them are minor and may be ignored. If the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected, potentially they can be identified and removed. When they are removed, the process is said to be 'stable'. When a process is stable, its variation should remain within a known set of limits. That is, at least, until another assignable source of variation occurs. For example, a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of cereal. Some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less. When the package weights are measured, the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights. If the production process, its inputs, or its environment (for example, the machine on the line) change, the distribution of the data will change. For example, as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear, the cereal filling machine may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box. Although this might benefit the customer, from the manufacturer's point of view it is wasteful, and increases the cost of production. If the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner, the change can be corrected (for example, the cams and pulleys replaced). Application The application of SPC involves three main phases of activity: #Understanding the process and the specification limits. #Eliminating assignable (special) sources of variation, so that the process is stable. #Monitoring the ongoing production process, assisted by the use of control charts, to detect significant changes of mean or variation. =Control charts= The data from measurements of variations at points on the process map is monitored using control charts. Control charts attempt to differentiate \\"assignable\\" (\\"special\\") sources of variation from \\"common\\" sources. \\"Common\\" sources, because they are an expected part of the process, are of much less concern to the manufacturer than \\"assignable\\" sources. Using control charts is a continuous activity, ongoing over time. Stable process When the process does not trigger any of the control chart \\"detection rules\\" for the control chart, it is said to be \\"stable\\". A process capability analysis may be performed on a stable process to predict the ability of the process to produce \\"conforming product\\" in the future. A stable process can be demonstrated by a process signature that is free of variances outside of the capability index. A process signature is the plotted points compared with the capability index. Excessive variations When the process triggers any of the control chart \\"detection rules\\", (or alternatively, the process capability is low), other activities may be performed to identify the source of the excessive variation. The tools used in these extra activities include: Ishikawa diagram, designed experiments, and Pareto charts. Designed experiments are a means of objectively quantifying the relative importance (strength) of sources of variation. Once the sources of (special cause) variation are identified, they can be minimized or eliminated. Steps to eliminating a source of variation might include: development of standards, staff training, error-proofing, and changes to the process itself or its inputs. Process stability metrics When monitoring many processes with control charts, it is sometimes useful to calculate quantitative measures of the stability of the processes. These metrics can then be used to identify/prioritize the processes that are most in need of corrective actions. These metrics can also be viewed as supplementing the traditional process capability metrics. Several metrics have been proposed, as described in Ramirez and Runger. They are (1) a Stability Ratio which compares the long-term variability to the short-term variability, (2) an ANOVA Test which compares the within-subgroup variation to the between- subgroup variation, and (3) an Instability Ratio which compares the number of subgroups that have one or more violations of the Western Electric rules to the total number of subgroups. Mathematics of control charts Digital control charts use logic-based rules that determine \\"derived values\\" which signal the need for correction. For example, :derived value = last value + average absolute difference between the last N numbers.

Origins of the phrase  The architect Louis Sullivan coined the maxim, although it is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor Horatio Greenough (18051852),Horatio Greenough, Form and Function: Remarks on Art, edited by Harold A. Small (Berkeley, Univ. of California Press, 1947), although the theory of inherent forms, of which the phrase is a loose summary, informs all of Greenough's writing on art, design, and architecture. Greenough was in his architectural writings influenced by the transcendentalist thinking and the Unitarian protestantism of Ralph Waldo Emerson. whose thinking mostly predates the later functionalist approach to architecture. Greenough's writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough. Sullivan was Greenough's much younger compatriot, and admired rationalist thinkers such as Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman, and Melville, as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered, though he later attributed the core idea to the Roman architect, engineer, and author Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, who first asserted in his book De architectura that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas ‚Äì that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful. Sullivan actually wrote \\"form ever follows function\\", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single \\"rule that shall permit of no exception\\". The full quote is: > Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, > the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding > stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form > ever follows function, and this is the law. Where function does not change, > form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for > ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. It is > the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things > physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of > all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the > life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. > This is the law. Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel skyscraper in late 19th-century Chicago at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, \\"form follows function\\", as opposed to \\"form follows precedent\\". Sullivan's assistant Frank Lloyd Wright adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form‚Äîperhaps because shaking off the old styles gave them more freedom and latitude.  Debate on the functionality of ornamentation  In 1908, the Austrian architect Adolf Loos wrote an allegorical essay titled \\"Ornament and Crime\\" in reaction to the elaborate ornament used by the Vienna Secession architects. Modernists adopted Loos's moralistic argument as well as Sullivan's maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.  Application in different fields  = Architecture = Home Building Association Bank by Sullivan The phrase \\"form (ever) follows function\\" became a battle cry of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call \\"ornament\\", were superfluous in modern buildings. However, Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush Art Nouveau and Celtic Revival decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature. = Product design = One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined Chrysler Airflow, when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a \\"teardrop\\" shape, which would not be good for unit sales.Jeffrey Meikle's \\"Twentieth Century Limited: Industrial Design in America, 1925 - 1939\\" General Motors adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, drag coefficient has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly. The American industrial designers of the 1930s and '40s like Raymond Loewy, Norman bel Geddes and Henry Dreyfuss grappled with the inherent contradictions of \\"form follows function\\" as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his \\"MAYA\\" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable) principle to express that product designs are bound by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising. By honestly applying \\"form follows function\\", industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business. Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding product differentiation. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements. (cf. planned obsolescence) From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary. Victor Papanek (died 1998) was an influential recent designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of \\"form follows function.\\" = Software engineering = It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact's requirements lead to roughly similar results. The principle can also be applied to enterprise application architectures of modern business where \\"function\\" is the Business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or \\"form\\". If the architecture dictates how the business operates then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility unable to adapt to change. Service-oriented architecture enables an enterprise architect to rearrange the \\"form\\" of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards based communication protocols which enable interoperability. Furthermore, domain-driven design postulates that structure (software architecture, design pattern, implementation) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain (functional requirement). While \\"form\\" and \\"function\\" may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, metaprogramming and the functional programming paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts. The agile software development movement espouses techniques such as 'test driven development' in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or 'form' emerges from actual function and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long term as well of as higher quality because of the functional base of automated tests. = Automobile designing = If the design of an automobile conforms to its function‚Äîfor instance the Fiat Multipla's shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows‚Äîthen its form is said to follow its function. = Evolution = According to Lamarck's long- discredited theory of evolution, anatomy will be structured according to functions associated with use; for instance, giraffes are taller to reach the leaves of trees. By contrast, in Darwinian evolution, form (variation) precedes function (as determined by selection). This is to say, in Lamarckian evolution the form is altered by the required function, whereas in Darwinian evolution small variations in form allow some parts of the population to function better, and are therefore more successful reproductively.

It is named after William Bell, a Master Mariner, who owned much of the property there since the 1840s. Many records wrongly accredit the locations name to John Calvert Bell of the family that took up a pastoral run there much later in 1905 and building the 'Addiscot' homestead. John Calvert Bell was, before that time, a resident at Calder Park, Mount Duneed, and not related to William Bell of Bells Beach. The beach and coastal reserve are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\\"Bells Beach Surfing Recreation Reserve (H2261)\\". Victorian Heritage Register. Heritage Victoria. Retrieved 2014-03-23. In the 2016 Census, there were 130 people in Bells Beach, 88.7% of whom were born in Australia and 94.5% of whom spoke only English at home. Surfing Bells Beach is the home of the world's longest continuously running pro surfing competition ‚Äì now known as the Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach. The event was formerly known as the Bells Easter Classic (among a variety of other titles). The competition was first held in January 1962 and then at Easter every year since although occasionally, when conditions at Bells aren't suitable, the competition has been transferred to other breaks such as Johanna and Woolamai. As early as 1939, surfers from Torquay made their way to Bells but access was a considerable problem until 1960, when Torquay surfers and Olympic wrestler Joe Sweeney hired a bulldozer and cleared a road along the Bells cliff Heritage Council of Victoria Annual Report 2003-04 from the Cobb & Co Road, where the concrete wave now stands, down to the beach. He charged one pound per surfer to recover his expenses. This is now part of the Surf Coast walking track. Nearby surf breaks include \\"Southside\\", \\"Centreside\\", \\"Rincon\\", \\"Winki Pop\\", (Uppers and Lowers), \\"Boobs\\" and \\"Steps\\". Although Bells is known internationally as one of the best breaks in Victoria, \\"Winki Pop\\" often works better under more diverse conditions than the other nearby breaks. The first \\"Surfboard Rally\\" at Bells Beach was organised by surfing pioneers Peter Troy and Vic Tantau to help promote sales of T Boards their own brand. Planned to run in December 1961 the event was postponed until 26 January 1962. From the following year the Australian Surf rider's Association - ASA (Victorian Branch) - Now called Surfing Victoria hosted and staged the annual surfing competition at Bells Beach held at Easter each year. The ASA also ran the conservation contest at Bells Beach which included tree planting in an effort to help preserve natural values every year since the mid-1970s. =Surfing competitions= * Rip Curl GromSearch National Series (under 17s) * Rip Curl Pro every Easter since 1962 =Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment (SANE)= In 1988 a group of local surfers who were concerned about the human impact that tourism was having on the Bells Beach Surfing Reserve started a group called Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment. Since 1988 they have met monthly to revegetate the reserve in an effort to bring it back to its original state. They have planted over 100,000 plants there to date. In popular culture Although the final scene of the film Point Break is set at Bells Beach, the scene was not filmed there. Bells Beach is a straight stretch and the beach in the film is a cove with spruce trees atop a hill. The actual location of the film was Indian Beach in Ecola State Park located in Cannon Beach, Oregon in the United States. Bells Beach is visited in the 1966 documentary film The Endless Summer. In the 2007 animation film Surf's Up, the Australian surfer is shown to be from Bells Beach.

It provides the major road link between southeastern Queensland and Victoria via central NSW and as such carries large amounts of freight. At in length, the Newell is the longest highway in NSW, and passes through fifteen local government areas. The highway is part of Australian national route 39 and was signposted accordingly until 2013. Since then it has been signposted as NSW route A39. Traffic volumes along the Newell Highway vary from around 1,200 to 4,000 vehicles per day in rural areas. In Dubbo, the largest urban centre through which the highway passes, average daily traffic volumes are in the order of 20,000 vehicles a day. Many heavy vehicles use the Newell Highway ‚Äì between 26 per cent and 52 per cent of all traffic, depending on the point along the highway. At one point in the Riverina region of NSW, the highway carries approximately 1,900 vehicles daily, of which about 32 per cent is heavy vehicles; while at another point in the north of the state, which carries the largest number of heavy vehicles, on average a truck passes every 60 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The highway is named in honour of H. H. Newell, the first Commissioner for Main Roads in New South Wales (1932-1941). It carries NSW route A39 signage for its entire length. Other than short four-lane lengths within some of the urban areas through which it passes, the Newell Highway is a single carriageway, two-lane road, although there are many overtaking lanes, with further overtaking lanes under construction up until 2021 (see Newell Highway Alliance Program\\" www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/newell-highway/program-alliance/index.html) The speed limit on most rural sections of the highway is . Route The terrain that the highway traverses is generally flat to gently undulating, with long, straight sections joined by the occasional curved section. However, passing through the Warrumbungle Range, there are steeper grades and tighter curves than on the rest of the highway. The highway runs generally north‚Äìsouth, parallel to the coast of NSW, about inland, and is the most direct road link from Victoria to southeastern Queensland, bypassing the more urbanised and congested coastal areas of the state, and in doing so avoiding the difficult coastal topography traversed by the Pacific Highway. From its northern terminus at Goondiwindi on the Queensland-NSW border, where it meets the Cunningham and Leichhardt Highways, and forms the southward extension of the Cunningham Highway from Warwick and Brisbane, the Newell runs south across the Queensland-New South Wales border through Boggabilla, Moree, Narrabri, Coonabarabran, Gilgandra, Dubbo, Parkes, Forbes, West Wyalong, Narrandera, Jerilderie, and . Its southern terminus is where it crosses the Murray River (part of the border between New South Wales and Victoria) at Tocumwal and meets the Goulburn Valley Highway in Victoria. The Goulburn Valley Highway forms the next section of national route 39 south towards Melbourne via Shepparton and Seymour, where it joins the Hume Highway. The Newell intersect the following highways: Bruxner (at Boggabilla), Carnarvon and Gwydir (at Moree), Kamilaroi (at Narrabri), Oxley (east) (north of Coonabarabran), Castlereagh and Oxley (west) (at Gilgandra), Golden and Mitchell (at Dubbo), Mid-Western (east) at Marsden), Mid-Western (west) at West Wyalong), Sturt (at Gillenbah) and Riverina (at Finley). The Newell Highway is located entirely west of the Great Dividing Range, running largely along the foot of the western slopes of the range, and as such crosses nine major rivers, all west- flowing from the Great Dividing Range. From north to south these rivers are the Macintyre (at Goondiwindi), the Gwydir (10 km north of Moree), the Mehi (at Moree), the Namoi (near Narrabri), the Castlereagh (at Coonabarabran and again at Gilgandra), the Macquarie (at Dubbo), the Lachlan (at Forbes), the Murrumbidgee (at Narrandera), and the Murray (at Tocumwal). Some sections of the Newell Highway are subject to periodic flooding from these rivers, particularly north of Moree, at Dubbo, and south of Narrandera. Naming and numbering The route now known as the Newell Highway was proclaimed as State Highway 17 in July 1938, and in July 1941 named in honour of H. H. Newell (Commissioner for Main Roads 1932-1941) following his death in office. At the time of the gazettal of state highway 17, it followed existing roads as far as possible, but between Coonabarabran and Narrabri and between Narrandera and West Wyalong no road existed. The section through the Pilliga Scrub between Coonabarabran and Narrabri was constructed during 1941-42 as a wartime defence project, and the section between Narrandera and West Wyalong was constructed in 1946‚Äì49. In 1952 the ultimate gazetted route of the highway between Narrandera and West Wyalong was altered from its original 1938 gazetted route. Under the original national road numbering scheme in 1954, national route 39 was to run from the Hume Highway (national route 30, subsequently changed to 31) at Seymour, via Shepparton Tocumwal, Finley, Narrandera, West Wyalong, Forbes, Parkes, Dubbo, Gilgandra, Coonabarabran, Narrabri, Moree, Goondiwindi, Moonie, Miles and Banana to Rockhampton, to connect with the Bruce Highway (national route 1). Consequently, the Newell Highway, as part of this route, was signposted in 1965 with the standard black and white national route markers. On 15 January 1993, following the passage of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the Australian Government assumed financial responsibility from the NSW government for the upkeep and improvement of the Newell Highway. It also assumed responsibility for the onward connectors from either end of the Newell Highway - the Goulburn Valley Highway in Victoria and the Cunningham Highway in Queensland. The black and white national route shields were then replaced with green and gold shields (signifying that the highway is a nationally rather than state-funded route). These in turn were replaced in 2013 by the alpha-numerical shields of the NSW state-based numbering system. Some sections of the route of the Newell Highway are shared with the routes of other highways. From north to south these are the Gwydir at Moree, the Kamilaroi at Narrabri, the Oxley (from 10 km north of Coonabarabran to Gilgandra), the Castlereagh through Gilgandra, the Mid-Western between Marsden and West Wyalong, and the Riverina (185 m through Finley). Route development Completion of the sealing of the full length of the highway occurred in 1972. Town centre bypasses have been provided in Moree, Dubbo, Parkes and West Wyalong (heavy vehicle route). A town bypass at Ardlethan has also been constructed.

A color of 28 pitches is arranged with a talea of four durations which repeats seven times (28 √∑ 4 = 7). Isorhythm (from the Greek for \\"the same rhythm\\") is a musical technique using a repeating rhythmic pattern, called a talea, in at least one voice part throughout a composition. Taleae are typically applied to one or more melodic patterns of pitches or colores, which may be of the same or a different length from the talea. History and development Isorhythms first appear in French motets of the 13th century, such as in the Montpellier Codex . Although 14th-century theorists used the words talea and color‚Äîthe latter in a variety of senses related to repetition and embellishment ‚Äîthe term \\"isorhythm\\" was not coined until 1904 by musicologist Friedrich Ludwig (1872‚Äì1930), initially to describe the practice in 13th-century polyphony. Ludwig later extended its use to the 14th-century music of Guillaume de Machaut. Subsequently, Heinrich Besseler and other musicologists expanded its scope further as an organizing structural element in 14th- and early 15th- century compositions‚Äîin particular, motets (; ). Some of the earliest works organized around isorhythms are early 14th-century motets by various composers in an illuminated manuscript of the Roman de Fauvel. Two of the era's most important composers of isorhythmic motets are Phillipe de Vitry (1291‚Äì1361) and Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300‚Äì1377) . Machaut's Motet No. 2, De souspirant/Tous corps qui de bien amer/Suspiro, is an example of typical 14th- century use of isorhythm . Isorhythm is a logical outgrowth of the rhythmic modes that governed most late medieval polyphony. Discarding modal-rhythmic limitations, isorhythm became a significant organizing principle of much of 14th-century French polyphony by extending the talea of an initial section to the entire composition in conjunction with variation of a corresponding color . \\"The playful complexity of ....[taleae] that mixes mensuration and undergoes diminution by half‚Äîbecame a typical, even a defining feature of motets in the 14th century and beyond\\" . Structural diagram of the isorhythmic tenor in Johannes Alanus' Sub arturo plebs ‚Äì Fons citharizantium ‚Äì In omnem terram. The structural diagram at right shows the isorhythmic tenor voice of a late 14th- century motet, Sub arturo plebs ‚Äì Fons citharizantium ‚Äì In omnem terram by Johannes Alanus (c. late 14th century), featuring threefold isorhythmic diminution. First staff: preexisting Gregorian cantus firmus melody, from the first antiphon for the first nocturn of the commons for Apostles, In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum ('their voice has gone out into all the world'). The cantus firmus of the motet is a perfect fifth higher than the original chant; notes used for the tenor marked in red. Second staff: isorhythmic tenor as notated in mensural notation. Numbers 1‚Äì3 and brackets indicate three rhythmically identical sequences (taleae). The three mensuration signs in the beginning define the pattern of diminution, indicating tempus perfectum cum prolatio maior, tempus perfectum cum prolatio minor and tempus imperfectum cum prolatio minor, respectively. (In the manuscript these signs are in fact found at the end of the line, together with a repetition sign.) Staves 2‚Äì5: abbreviated transcription into modern notation. Each line represents one full repetition of the tenor's melody (color), including the three taleae in each, resulting in a nine-part structure. (Within each color, only the first few notes of each talea are rendered here.) The three mensuration signs in the line above correspond to the change in time signatures: , , . During the decades following and into the 15th century, upper voices became increasingly involved in isorhythmic organization. Many compositions became isorhythmic in all voices, a practice known as panisorhythm. In such compositions, the length of the \\"color\\" and \\"talea\\" are often unequal, causing the repetition of the melody in differing rhythmic patterns. As an example, if the \\"color\\" includes nine notes and the \\"talea\\" five, the \\"color\\" would have to be repeated five times before the two schemes again realign. Examples can be found in motets and Mass movements by John Dunstable, Johannes Ciconia and Guillaume Du Fay . A 15th-century Mass by a composer known only as Pycard found in the Old Hall manuscript (named for the English town in which it was eventually discovered), demonstrates the high sophistication and complexity of panisorhythmic techniques. The lower parts have a recurring color and talea that unite the composition. The upper parts have four different talea, one for each major section of the composition. The rhythmic relationship between upper and lower parts changes as the music progresses. Each quarter note in the lower part equals 4¬Ω quarter notes in the upper parts, creating an uneven ratio of 4:9 that causes the parts to lose synchronization. The lower part then steadily contracts in a series of Pythagorean proportions (12:9:8:6) until the parts come back into alignment . As an analytical concept, isorhythm has proven valuable for understanding musical practices in other cultures; for example, the peyote cult songs of certain North American Indian groups and the music of India and Africa .

The island is 10 km in length, 2 km wide and consists of a large lagoonal reef system along its leeward side, with 28 small islets along its coast. In 1999, the waters within three nautical miles of Lord Howe Island (465.45 km2) were declared a marine park under the NSW Marine Park Act 1997 to protect its unique marine biodiversity, with the park currently being managed by the New South Wales Marine Parks Authority. Both Lord Howe Island and Balls Pyramid are incorporated within the three nautical miles protected by the state marine park. Both marine parks complement the island's status as a World Heritage Site. Lord Howe Island is located approximately northeast of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Lord Howe Island is remote, has a biologically diverse marine system with a high degree of endemism. Lord Howe Island Marine Park was declared after it was recognised as an area with outstanding natural values, an extraordinary array of marine habitats and biodiversity, rich maritime cultural heritage and social and economic importance to the island community, giving it both national and international importance.  History of management  = Establishment of the Marine Park = The marine park was declared on 26 February 1999 under the Marine Parks Act 1997, with a zoning plan commencing on 1 December 2004 to protect the important natural and cultural values of the park while providing a range of sustainable uses. Due to its isolated geographic location, small size and limited access, there are a number of threats to biodiversity that require management. The marine park status helps protect marine biodiversity from fishing pressure and population pressure. A range of scientific, social, cultural and economic information was collated to design the zoning plan. In August 2001 an Issues Paper was released for public comment and submissions reviewed. In June 2002, a draft zoning plan document was established outlining a number of options for zoning, incorporating the submissions gained through the public comment period, advice taken from the Lord Howe Island Marine Park Advisory Committee and a review of relevant information. This plan was released for public comment in December 2003 with a finalised zoning plan and implementation of marine park zones commencing on 1 December 2004. The waters from 3 - 12 nautical miles were declared a federal marine park on 21 June 2000, see Lord Howe Island Marine Park (Commonwealth waters). = Management practices = In 1999, the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) was brought in. The EPBC Act provides guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities through the implementation of the marine bioregional planning process. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment. This process identified the regional conservation priorities in a number of different marine regions and identified the marine reserves to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Lord Howe Island Marine park was identified as requiring protection. To protect the various marine conservation values associated with the waters around Lord Howe Island, the New South Wales government proclaimed the Lord Howe Island Marine Park in 1999. However, it wasn't until 2004 that a zoning scheme came into force due to lengthy negotiations with stakeholders. This zoning scheme partitioned the coastal waters of Lord Howe Island to permit different human uses, in order to minimise the threat to marine conservation values. The objectives of the zoning plan under the Marine Parks Act 1997 include: 1) to conserve marine biological diversity and marine habitats, 2) to maintain ecological processes, 3) where consistent with the preceding, to provide for ecologically sustainable use of fish and marine vegetation, and 4) to provide opportunities for public appreciation, understanding and enjoyment. The zoning plan for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park provides various levels of biodiversity protection, regulating activities according to zones. 73.2% of the Marine Park, known as Habitat Protection Zones, allows most forms of fishing: charter boat and recreational, but excludes spearfishing. The other 26.8% of the Marine Park are zoned as seven Sanctuary Zones, where fishing, anchoring and other harmful human activities are excluded. While 0.004% (1.7ha) of the marine park is considered a Special Purpose Zone used for special management needs, specifically to allow limited fish feeding. Lord Howe Island Marine park does not contain any General Use zones, like other Marine Parks in New South Wales. The zoning plan also contains regulations on specific activities and provides additional protection on species of particular importance. The zoning plan gives protection to important natural and cultural values of the marine park, while allowing sustainable use including swimming, surfing, charter and recreational fishing, scuba diving, sailing, boating and research. Visitor numbers are restricted on the island to control impacts to the Marine Park.  Climate  Lord Howe Island has a temperate climate, with mean water temperatures of 25 ¬∞C in summer and 18 ¬∞C in winter. Annual rainfall is 1650mm in the lowland parts of the island. Lord Howe Island's climate is moderated by oceanic air currents and mild sea temperatures. The island can be windy as the salt laden wind comes predominantly from the southeast and northeast and the mean wind speed is highest in late winter and spring.  Biodiversity values  = Geomorphology = Lord Howe Island is regarded as having high geological, geomorphological and geodiversity values, many of which extend to the habitats of the marine park. Lord Howe Island is situated at the southernmost limit of coral reef formation, receiving both tropical and temperate open ocean carbon environments. Slowly, over time Lord Howe Island is moving into reef forming seas due to the northward migration of Australia's tectonic plate, which is moving 5‚Äì6 cm north per year. A white sedimentary rock known as calcarenite is locally important within the marine park as it makes up the central and northern regions of the island to below sea level in several places. Calcarenite is formed through the cementing of calcareous algae, coral fragments and sand. Dating has indicated that calcarenite was deposited in the past 350,000 years during the Pleistocene period. The beach and shallow-water calcarenites indicate a sea level around 2-3m above the present level during the last interglacial period (130,000-70,000 years ago, Pleistocene). Little evidence of reefs during this time can be seen as they may have occupied locations similar to those of modern reefs or were largely destroyed following emergence once the sea level fell. The fringing reef on the windward western coastline of Lord Howe Island absorbs wave energy and acts as a breakwater preventing storm surges from eroding the low lying central region of the island. The sheltered lagoon contains a number of different reef habitats, dominated by sand, lagoonal corals, gravel sheets, algal flats and patch reefs. = Ecology = The high conservation significance of Lord Howe Island and its waters is recognised by its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982. Conservation values relating to the marine park include the unique combination of tropical and temperature reef taxa, both flora and fauna. These unique taxa include a number of species at the limits of their distribution, reflecting the extreme latitude of the coral reef ecosystem, making Lord Howe Island Marine Park the southernmost true coral reef in the world. Lord Howe Island Marine Park is also home to a high diversity of marine benthic algae, fishes and marine invertebrates and is associated with high levels of endemicity. Lord Howe Island was only discovered by humans in 1778, consequently the original flora and fauna has remained relatively untouched.  Flora  Three distinct marine habitat community types have been identified within the Marine Park: coral reefs, macroalgal beds, and offshore/open coast communities. The distribution of these depends on wave exposure. The Lord Howe Island Group supports more than 305 benthic algae species, including 47 endemic species. Hence, approximately 15% of the benthic algal species are endemic to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park. Also, two species of non-endemic sea grasses are found within the marine park: Eelgrass, Zostera muelleri subsp capricorni and Paddleweed, Halophila ovalis.  Fauna  Providence Petrel, a Lord Howe Island seabird listed as Vulnerable under the NSW TSC ActThe marine life comprise both subtropical and temperate species due to its location and influence of the southerly flowing East Australian Current (EAC). As a consequence, the waters surrounding Lord Howe Island show rich and unique biodiversity. An extensive barrier coral reef protects a broad sheltered lagoon and sandy beach on the western side of the island, while fringing reef occurs immediately offshore of the beaches on the eastern side. The Lord Howe Island Group supports a diverse inshore fish fauna with greater than 400 species recorded. 10% of the marine inshore fish species are known to be endemic, meaning they are only found at Lord Howe Island, while 8% of the 110 species of echinoderms are also endemic. A wide variety of seabirds roost and nest on the island but feed on schools of fish and squid. This diversity reflects the mixing of tropical species with temperate species and the range of marine environments present.  Human impacts, environmental issues and threats  It is becoming widely known that the world's marine biodiversity is under threat due to overexploitation and degrading human activities, such as pollution rapidly changing species habitat and leading to species loss. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and four invertebrate species have become locally extinct. Isolated islands are under a disproportionate level of threat due to their small range and high level of endemic taxa. Even small human-induced disturbances can lead to species extinction. Key threatening processes relevant to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park include anthropogenic climate change, and entanglement in or ingestion of anthropogenic debris in marine environments. Anthropogenic climate change is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation (TSC) Act 1995 while loss of climatic habitat caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases is listed under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. Climate change is likely to alter sea surface temperatures which can have severe consequences for seabird breeding. There has been significant growth in people pressure over time. Visitor numbers have increased significantly as has the amount of available accommodation options. From 1988 to 2000 the Lord Howe Island population grew by 13%, the number of dwellings increased by 55% and the number of visitors increased by nearly 100%. = The marine littoral zone = Lord Howe Island has 37 km of shoreline or littoral zone, with only eight kilometres readily accessible. This eight kilometres has been most heavily impacted as most of the forest has been cleared to the edge of the beach, removing the buffer to strong prevalent winds, impacting the forest behind. = The lagoon = View of the lagoon from Mount Eliza. The lagoon forms the majority of the Lord Howe Island Marine ParkThe lagoon is six kilometres long and 1.5 km wide and contains the largest of Lord Howe Island's coral reef system, assessed as having World Heritage values. The main identified threats to the marine environment are the impact of water quality welling up in the lagoon from groundwater, the potential changes of turbidity affecting the clarity of water in the lagoon, the impact from anchor damage (outside as well as inside the lagoon), overfishing particularly of the slower growing fish species which inhabit the drop-off, and dramatic water temperature changes causing coral bleaching and death of other marine species.  Results of management  To abate human influence on marine biodiversity worldwide, marine parks are becoming widely advocated as a tool for conserving biodiversity and managing overfishing. Elsewhere, protected areas such as marine reserves have been attributed to increased species densities, biodiversity, species growth, biomass, and reproductive output. It is a similar case for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park Species habitat is typically used as the major component of designing marine parks: if a number of habitat classes are protected, so are the species within them, hence effectively protecting and hopefully in turn increasing marine biodiversity. This is the goal of the marine park at Lord Howe Island. A study conducted in 2010, six years after the implementation of zoning showed the mean number of fish species, density and biomass of fishes is typically higher in sanctuary zones than in habitat protection zones where fishing is allowed. The mean cover of hard corals was also higher in sanctuary zones. Sanctuary zones have been found successful in protecting key species and biomass, though longer term datasets and further research into increasing subtidal macro algal communities in sanctuary zones is required. A review of other research following the implementation of the Marine Park has outlined a number of successes and negative outcomes. This research found the Galapagos shark, Carcharhinus galapagensis increased in number in sanctuary zones, while there was an increase in abundance of the endemic double header wrasse, Coris bulbifrons, bluefish, Girella cyanea and the spotted sawtail, Prionurus maculates, in sanctuary zones. Negative outcomes have shown populations of the habitat modifying urchin, Centrostaphanus rodgersii, increased threefold between 2006-2010 and densities of the second most abundant urchin, Heliocidaris tuberculata, has doubled. If sea urchins become overpopulated, they can have major impacts on reef systems through overgrazing of important algae. Other negatives include a large and significant decline in population of bluefish within habitat protection zones. While there will continue to be both success and failures following the implementation of the marine park, the successes will continue to outweigh the failures until such time that equilibrium within the marine ecosystem is reached, this can take up to 20 years from the date of implementation.

The tale is included in the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification system as type 156. The story reappeared in the Middle Ages as \\"The Shepherd and the Lion\\" and was then ascribed to Aesop's Fables. It is numbered 563 in the Perry Index and can be compared to Aesop's The Lion and the Mouse in both its general trend and in its moral of the reciprocal nature of mercy.  Classical tale  The earliest surviving account of the episode is found in Aulus Gellius's 2nd century Attic Nights.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, Book V. xiv The author relates there a story told by Apion in his lost work Aegyptiacorum (Wonders of Egypt), the events of which Apion claimed to have personally witnessed in Rome. In this version, Androclus (going by the Latin variation of the name) is a runaway slave of a former Roman consul administering a part of Africa. He takes shelter in a cave, which turns out to be the den of a wounded lion, from whose paw he removes a large thorn. In gratitude, the lion becomes tame towards him and henceforward shares his catch with the slave. After three years, Androclus craves a return to civilization but is soon imprisoned as a fugitive slave and sent to Rome. There he is condemned to be devoured by wild animals in the Circus Maximus in the presence of an emperor who is named in the account as Gaius Caesar, presumably Caligula.Based on the dates of Apion's tenure in Rome, see The most imposing of the beasts turns out to be the same lion, which again displays its affection toward Androclus. After questioning him, the emperor pardons the slave in recognition of this testimony to the power of friendship, and he is left in possession of the lion. Apion, who claimed to have been a spectator on this occasion, is then quoted as relating: > Afterwards we used to see Androclus with the lion attached to a slender > leash, making the rounds of the tabernae throughout the city; Androclus was > given money, the lion was sprinkled with flowers, and everyone who met them > anywhere exclaimed, \\"This is the lion, a man's friend; this is the man, a > lion's doctor\\".The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius, p. 258 The story was repeated a century later by Claudius Aelianus in his work On the Nature of Animals.Claudius Aelianus, Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œñ·ø¥œâŒΩ ·º∏Œ¥ŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, Book VII.xlviii Later use Later versions of the story, sometimes attributed to Aesop, began to appear from the mid-sixth century under the title \\"The Shepherd and the Lion\\". In Chr√©tien de Troyes' 12th-century romance, \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", the knightly main character helps a lion that is attacked by a serpent. The lion then becomes his companion and helps him during his adventures. A century later, the story of taking a thorn from a lion's paw was related as an act of Saint Jerome in the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine ().The story is included in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of this translation Afterwards the lion joins him in the monastery and a different set of stories follows. The later retelling, \\"Of the Remembrance of Benefits\\", in the Gesta Romanorum (Deeds of the Romans) of about 1330 in England, has a mediaeval setting and again makes the protagonist a knight. In the earliest English printed collection of Aesop's Fables by William Caxton, the tale appears as The lyon & the pastour or herdman and reverts to the story of a shepherd who cares for the wounded lion. He is later convicted of a crime and taken to Rome to be thrown to the wild beasts, only to be recognised and defended from the other animals by the one that he tended. A Latin poem by Vincent Bourne dating from 1716‚Äì17 is based on the account of Aulus Gellius.Estelle Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne, American Philosophical Society 2007, pp.52‚Äì4 Titled Mutua Benevolentia primaria lex naturae est, it was translated by William Cowper as ‚ÄúReciprocal kindness: the primary law of nature‚Äù.The poetical works, Latin and English, of Vincent Bourne, London 1838, pp.128‚Äì31 George Bernard Shaw's play Androcles and the Lion (1912) makes Androcles a tailor; he is also given Christian beliefs for the purposes of the play, which on the whole takes a skeptical view of religion. The first film adaptation of the story in the US was also made in 1912. Afterwards there were several others for both cinema and TV.IMDb.com Rob Englehart's The Lion, the Slave and the Rodent (2010) was a much later American approach to the fable.

Titled Le Mendiant (the beggar), it is made of bronze gilt and shows the former slave standing with one hand on the lion's mane and a begging bowl at his feet. On its stand is the inscription Date obolum Androcli (spare a penny for Androclus).Wikimedia In the 20th century the American sculptor Frederick Charles Shrady incorporated the theme of removing the thorn from the paw into a modernistic design.Shrady site =Medals= Gioacchino Francesco Travani's medal in honour of Pope Alexander VII The legend has figured on medals for various reasons over the course of four centuries. One attributed to Gioacchino Francesco Travani, using a design by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, was struck in 1659. It depicts on one side a relief bust of Pope Alexander VII surrounded by an acanthus leaf border. On the reverse a lion prostrates itself at the feet of an armed Androcles. The complimentary Latin inscription reads 'Domenico Jacobacci to the generous prince: Even a wild animal remembers a favor'. Jacobacci was the donor of the medal, which commemorates a pope who had been generous in rebuilding parts of Rome. The lion represents the grateful city paying homage at the feet of the 'warrior' on its behalf.Maarten Delbeke, The Art of Religion, Farnham 2012, Google Books The image of the grateful beast was a natural choice for the medals awarded in yearly recognition of prize-winners at the Royal Dick Veterinary College in Edinburgh. Struck in copper and silver during the 1890s, they picture Androcles kneeling to relieve the suffering lion. In the background are a cliff on the left and palm trees on the right; Androcles is depicted with African features.British school medals, Neocollect A more schematic representation now forms the logo of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Utrecht University. In the 20th century, the Dutch Medal of Recognition 1940‚Äì1945 also pictured the scene of relieving the lion and was awarded to those who aided the Dutch during the period of World War II, or afterwards helped those who had suffered from the German occupation. The subject was chosen because a lion was the national symbol. The theme of gratitude is reinforced by the inscription about the edge: Sibi benefacit qui benefacit amico (He benefits himself who benefits a friend).

This design has benefits in a jet-powered aircraft as it leaves the rear of the fuselage clear of interference from the jet's exhausts. To test the concept the MiG-8 was powered by a Shvetsov M-11 five-cylinder radial engine, with a pusher propeller. Operational history The aircraft was used as a testbed for developing the swept wing of the MiG-15, and afterwards continued to fly as a communications/utility aircraft for the OKB. Being made of wood and fabric, it was very light and reportedly a favorite among MiG OKB test pilots for its docile, slow-speed handling characteristics.

S/MIME is on an IETF standards track and defined in a number of documents, most importantly . It was originally developed by RSA Data Security and the original specification used the IETF MIME specificationRFC 2045: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). Part One was published in November 1996. with the de facto industry standard PKCS#7 secure message format. Change control to S/MIME has since been vested in the IETF and the specification is now layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), an IETF specification that is identical in most respects with PKCS #7. S/MIME functionality is built into the majority of modern email software and interoperates between them. Since it is built on CMS, MIME can also hold an advanced electronic signature.  Function  S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications: * Authentication * Message integrity * Non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures) * Privacy * Data security (using encryption) S/MIME specifies the MIME type \`application/pkcs7-mime\` (smime-type \\"enveloped-data\\") for data enveloping (encrypting) where the whole (prepared) MIME entity to be enveloped is encrypted and packed into an object which subsequently is inserted into an application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.  S/MIME certificates  Before S/MIME can be used in any of the above applications, one must obtain and install an individual key/certificate either from one's in-house certificate authority (CA) or from a public CA. The accepted best practice is to use separate private keys (and associated certificates) for signature and for encryption, as this permits escrow of the encryption key without compromise to the non- repudiation property of the signature key. Encryption requires having the destination party's certificate on store (which is typically automatic upon receiving a message from the party with a valid signing certificate). While it is technically possible to send a message encrypted (using the destination party certificate) without having one's own certificate to digitally sign, in practice, the S/MIME clients will require the user to install their own certificate before they allow encrypting to others. This is necessary so the message can be encrypted for both, recipient and sender, and a copy of the message can be kept (in the sent folder) and be readable for the sender. A typical basic (\\"class 1\\") personal certificate verifies the owner's \\"identity\\" only insofar as it declares that the sender is the owner of the \\"From:\\" email address in the sense that the sender can receive email sent to that address, and so merely proves that an email received really did come from the \\"From:\\" address given. It does not verify the person's name or business name. If a sender wishes to enable email recipients to verify the sender's identity in the sense that a received certificate name carries the sender's name or an organization's name, the sender needs to obtain a certificate (\\"class 2\\") from a CA who carries out a more in-depth identity verification process, and this involves making inquiries about the would-be certificate holder. For more detail on authentication, see digital signature. Depending on the policy of the CA, the certificate and all its contents may be posted publicly for reference and verification. This makes the name and email address available for all to see and possibly search for. Other CAs only post serial numbers and revocation status, which does not include any of the personal information. The latter, at a minimum, is mandatory to uphold the integrity of the public key infrastructure.  Obstacles to deploying S/MIME in practice  * S/MIME is sometimes considered not properly suited for use via webmail clients. Though support can be hacked into a browser, some security practices require the private key to be kept accessible to the user but inaccessible from the webmail server, complicating the key advantage of webmail: providing ubiquitous accessibility. This issue is not fully specific to S/MIME: other secure methods of signing webmail may also require a browser to execute code to produce the signature; exceptions are PGP Desktop and versions of GnuPG, which will grab the data out of the webmail, sign it by means of a clipboard, and put the signed data back into the webmail page. Seen from the view of security this is a more secure solution. * S/MIME is tailored for end-to-end security. Logically it is not possible to have a third party inspecting email for malware and also have secure end-to-end communications. Encryption will not only encrypt the messages, but also the malware. Thus if mail is not scanned for malware anywhere but at the end points, such as a company's gateway, encryption will defeat the detector and successfully deliver the malware. The only solution to this is to perform malware scanning on end user stations after decryption. Other solutions do not provide end-to-end trust as they require keys to be shared by a third party for the purpose of detecting malware. Examples of this type of compromise are: ** Solutions which store private keys on the gateway server so decryption can occur prior to the gateway malware scan. These unencrypted messages are then delivered to end users. ** Solutions which store private keys on malware scanners so that it can inspect messages content, the encrypted message is then relayed to its destination. * Due to the requirement of a certificate for implementation, not all users can take advantage of S/MIME, as some may wish to encrypt a message, with a public/private key pair for example, without the involvement or administrative overhead of certificates. Any message that an S/MIME email client stores encrypted cannot be decrypted if the applicable key pair's private key is unavailable or otherwise unusable (e.g., the certificate has been deleted or lost or the private key's password has been forgotten). However, an expired, revoked, or untrusted certificate will remain usable for cryptographic purposes. Indexing of encrypted messages' clear text may not be possible with all email clients. Neither of these potential dilemmas is specific to S/MIME but rather cipher text in general and do not apply to S/MIME messages that are only signed and not encrypted. S/MIME signatures are usually \\"detached signatures\\": the signature information is separate from the text being signed. The MIME type for this is \`multipart/signed\` with the second part having a MIME subtype of \`application/(x-)pkcs7-signature\`. Mailing list software is notorious for changing the textual part of a message and thereby invalidating the signature; however, this problem is not specific to S/MIME, and a digital signature only reveals that the signed content has been changed.  Security issues  On May 13, 2018, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) announced critical vulnerabilities in S/MIME, together with an obsolete form of PGP that is still used, in many email clients. Dubbed EFAIL, this is a particularly critical hit to S/MIME that will require significant coordinated effort by many email client vendors to fix.

About NetLogo was designed by Uri Wilensky, in the spirit of the programming language Logo, to be \\"low threshold and no ceiling\\". It teaches programming concepts using agents in the form of turtles, patches, links and the observer. NetLogo was designed for multiple audiences in mind, in particular: teaching children in the education community, and for domain experts without a programming background to model related phenomena. Many scientific articles have been published using NetLogo. The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains, such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, system dynamics. NetLogo allows exploration by modifying switches, sliders, choosers, inputs, and other interface elements. Beyond exploring, NetLogo allows authoring new models and modifying extant models. NetLogo is open source and freely available from the NetLogo website. It is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school. Many teachers make use of NetLogo in their curricula. NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky, director of Northwestern University's Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL).  Other features  In addition to agent-based modeling, NetLogo also includes basic support for dynamic system modeling.  Books  Several books have been published about NetLogo.

Commercial licenses are also available. It is written in Scala and Java and runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM). At its core is a hybrid interpreter/compiler that partially compiles user code to JVM bytecode. NetLogo Web is a version that runs on JavaScript, instead of the JVM, so models may be run in a web browser. However, it does not have all features of the desktop version, and the official website advises that the \\"desktop version of NetLogo is recommended for most uses\\". Examples A simple multiagent model in NetLogo is the Wolf-Sheep Predation model, which is shown in the screenshot above. It models the population growth of a predator/prey system over time. It has the following characteristics: * There are two breed of turtles, called sheep and wolves. * Sheep and wolves move randomly and have limited energy. * Wolves and sheep lose energy by moving. If a wolf or sheep has zero energy, it dies. * Sheep gain energy by eating grass. * Wolves gain energy by eating sheep. * Both wolves and sheep can reproduce, sharing energy with their offspring. HubNet HubNet is a technology that uses NetLogo to run participatory simulations in the classroom. In a participatory simulation, a whole group of users takes part in enacting the behavior of a system. Using an individual device, such as a networked computer or Texas Instruments graphing calculator, each user acts as a separate, independent agent.

Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats can match any color they see with a mixture of no more than two pure spectral lights. By comparison, trichromats can perceive colors made of up to three pure spectral lights, and tetrachromats can perceive colors made of four. Dichromacy in humans is a color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and sex-linked, predominantly affecting males.Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. Dictionary of Eye Terminology. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990. Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.\\"Guidelines: Colour Blindness.\\" Tiresias.org. Retrieved 29 September 2006. The term is from di meaning \\"two\\" and chroma meaning \\"color\\". Classification There are various kinds of color blindness: * Protanopia is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which there is impairment in perception of very long wavelengths, such as reds. To these individuals, reds are perceived as beige or grey and greens tend to look beige or grey like reds. It is also the most common type of dichromacy today. This problem occurs because patients do not have the red cone cells in the retina. Protanomaly is a less severe version. * Deuteranopia consists of an impairment in perceiving medium wavelengths, such as greens. Deuteranomaly is a less severe form of deuteranopia. Those with deuteranomaly cannot see reds and greens like those without this condition; however, they can still distinguish them in most cases. It is very similar to protanopia. In this form, patients do not have green cone cells in the retina, which makes it hard to see the green color. * A rarer form of color blindness is tritanopia, where there exists an inability to perceive short wavelengths, such as blues. Sufferers have trouble distinguishing between yellow and blue. They tend to confuse greens and blues, and yellow can appear pink. This is the rarest of all dichromacy, and occurs in around 1 in 100,000 people. Patients do not have the blue cone cells in the retina. Diagnosis The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane. The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provide enough information to identify the fundamental colour space, the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour. The cones excited to a corresponding colour in the colour space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colours. Color detecting abilities of dichromats According to colour vision researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (including Jay Neitz), each of the three standard colour-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats ‚Äì blue, green and red ‚Äì can pick up about 100 different gradations of colour. If each detector is independent of the others, simple exponentiation gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million; nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million. Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green color blindness) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours,\\"Color Vision:Almost Reason for Having Eyes\\" by Jay Neitz, Joseph Carroll, and Maureen Neitz Optics & Photonics News January 2001 1047-6938/01/01/0026/8- Optical Society of America but no such calculation has been verified by psychophysical testing. Furthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for coloured stimuli flickering at low (1 Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16 Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats. This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual percept as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough frame rate. Other animals It is more informative to use situations where less than the total visual system is operating when studying about vision. For example, a system by which cones are the sole visual receptors could be used. This is rare in humans but certain animals possess this trait and this proves useful in understanding the concept of dichromacy. While their Triassic ancestors were trichromatic, placental mammals are as a rule dichromatic; the ability to see long wavelengths (and thus separate green and red) was lost in the ancestor of placental mammals, though it is believed to have been retained in marsupials, where trichromatic vision is widespread. Recent genetic and behavioral evidence suggests the South American marsupial Didelphis albiventris is dichromatic, with only two classes of cone opsins having been found within the genus Didelphis. Dichromatic vision may improve an animal's ability to distinguish colours in dim light; the typically nocturnal nature of mammals, therefore, may have led to the evolution of dichromacy as the basal mode of vision in placental animals. The exceptions to dichromatic vision in placental mammals are primates closely related to humans, which are usually trichromats, and sea mammals (both pinnipeds and cetaceans) which are cone monochromats. New World Monkeys are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats.Sternberg, Robert J.

The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language code was written by Charles Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s. History Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison were introduced to Atari's arcade game Touch Me at the Music Operators of America (MOA) trade show in 1976. Baer said of the product, \\"Nice gameplay. Terrible execution. Visually boring. Miserable, rasping sounds.\\" The prototype built by Baer used the low cost Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcontroller chip, which was in many games of the 1970s. Lenny Cope, who was one of Ralph H. Baer's partners, programmed the core of the game, titled Follow Me at the time. Baer developed the tones of the game, inspired by the notes of a bugle. When they pitched the demo, an 8-by-8-inch console, to the Milton Bradley Company the name of the game was changed to Simon. Simon debuted in 1978 at a retail price of $24.95 () and became one of the top-selling toys that Christmas. : \\"Microcomputer controlled game\\", was granted in 1980. Milton Bradley soon capitalized on the original with both the smaller-sized Pocket Simon and the expanded, eight-button Super Simon. Many variants of Simon have been made since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s, building on the possibilities offered by advances in technology. The original Super Simon was reinvented in the late 1990s as a hexagonal unit with six buttons. 2000 saw Simon Squared (or Simon2), a unit with the four traditional buttons on one side, and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other. In 2004, Hasbro released the Simon Stix. The game features two electronic sticks (modeled after drumsticks), an emphasis on the musical part of the game, and features four levels of play. In 2005, Hasbro released Simon Trickster (also known as Simon Tricks in Europe and in the UK, and as Simon Genius in Brazil), which features four game modes, in a similar fashion to another Hasbro game, Bop It, and colored lenses instead of buttons. \\"Simon Classic\\" mode plays up to 35 tones(notes). \\"Simon Bounce\\" is similar to \\"Simon Classic\\", but instead the colors of the lenses change. \\"Simon Surprise\\" is one of the most difficult games in the unit. Every lens becomes the same color and the player has to memorize the location. \\"Simon Rewind\\" requires the player to memorize the sequence backwards. During each game, the player is paid a compliment after a certain number of tones completed. On reaching five and eleven tones, the computer will randomly choose \\"Awesome!\\", \\"Nice!\\", \\"Sweet!\\" or \\"Respect!\\". On reaching 18 tones, the game will play a victory melody three times. On reaching the ultimate 35 tones, the game will play the victory melody again and will say \\"Respect!\\". If the player fails to memorize the pattern or fails to press the right color within the time limit, the game will play a crashing sound and the game will say \\"Later!\\". In 2011, Hasbro introduced Simon Flash. In this version, the game is played with four cube- shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending on the game mode. In 2013, Hasbro reinvented Simon once again with Simon Swipe. The game was demonstrated at the New York Toy Fair 2014 and released that summer. The game is a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel. It has been extended from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are flattened out on the unit. The game features four game modes, called \\"Levels\\" (the main game), \\"Classic\\", \\"Party\\" and \\"Extreme\\". The player has to go through all sixteen levels to beat the game. \\"Classic\\", \\"Party\\" and \\"Extreme\\" levels focus on one pattern getting longer and longer until the player is out. A smaller version of the game, called Simon Micro Series, was introduced in the fall of 2014. This version has only two game modes called \\"Solo\\" and \\"Pass It\\" and features 14 levels and four buttons. There is also a version of Simon created by Basic Fun known as the Touch Simon. This version has an LCD screen and plays melodies at specific parts of the game. In 2016, Hasbro launched the followup to Simon Swipe with Simon Air. The game was announced at a Hasbro press conference before the 2016 New York Toy Fair. This version of Simon uses motion sensors, similar to those in Mattel's Loopz line of games. The game has three game modes, \\"Solo\\", \\"Classic\\" and \\"Multiplayer\\". A button-pressing version of Simon was also released in the US, with an aesthetic recalling that of the 1970s and 1980s models. Recently, Hasbro has released Simon Optix, a headset game with a motion sensor technology similar to Simon Air. Gameplay The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.) Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says, but the gameplay is based on Atari's unpopular Touch Me arcade game from 1974. Simon differs from Touch Me in that the Touch Me buttons were all of the same color (black) and the sounds it produced were harsh and grating. Simon's tones, on the other hand, were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence, and consisted of an A major triad in second inversion, resembling a trumpet fanfare: * E-note (blue, lower right); * C‚ôØ-note (yellow, lower left); * A-note (red, upper right). * E-note (green, upper left, an octave lower than blue); The re-released version of Simon Simon was later re-released by Milton Bradley - now owned by Hasbro - in its original circular form, though with a translucent case rather than plain black. It was also sold as a two-sided Simon Squared version, with the reverse side having eight buttons for head-to- head play, and as a keychain (officially licensed by Fun4All) with simplified gameplay (only having Game 1, Difficulty 4 available). Other variations of the original game, no longer produced, include Pocket Simon and the eight-button Super Simon, both from 1980. Nelsonic released an official wristwatch version of Simon. Later versions of the game included a pocket version of the original game in a smaller, yellow, oval-shaped case. Another iteration, Simon Trickster, plays the original game as well as variations in which the colors shift around from button to button (Simon Bounce), the buttons have no colors at all (Simon Surprise) and the player must repeat the sequence backwards (Simon Rewind). A pocket version of Simon Trickster was also produced. In the 2014 version of Simon called Simon Swipe, the notes are as follows: * G-note (blue, lower right); * C-note (yellow, lower left); * E-note (red, upper right). * G-note (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue) The swiping sounds are presented with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, the bigger the swipe will be. The exact notes and sound effects were also used for a smaller version called Simon Micro Series. The sounds were then recreated for Simon Air and Simon Optix. Clones As a popular game, Simon inspired many imitators and knockoffs. Atari released a handheld version of Touch Me in 1978, with multicolored buttons and pleasant musical tones. Though named for the older arcade game, the handheld Touch Me contained Simon's three game variations and four difficulty levels, albeit with limits of 8, 16, 32 and 99 instead of 8, 14, 20 and 31. Even its button layout mirrored that of Simon (though upside-down), with blue in the upper left, yellow in the upper right, red in the lower left and green in the lower right. Its only unique features were an LED score display, similar to that of its arcade counterpart, and its small size, similar to that of a pocket calculator. Other clones include: * Monkey See, Monkey Do, which featured a similar casing as that of Simon, except that the buttons were oval-shaped. * Tiger Electronics' Copy Cat in 1979, re-released with a transparent case in 1988 and using buzzers. ** Repackaged and released by Sears as Follow Me. ** Released as Copy Cat Jr. in 1981, and as Pocket Repeat by Tandy Computers and Radio Shack. * Castle Toy's Einstein in 1979. * Genius, launched in the 80s in Brazil, by Brinquedos Estrela. * Space Echo by an unknown company. * Makezine has a DIY version that requires soldering. * Another DIY version called Electronic Memory Game based on ARM Cortex microcontrollers * The \\"Game A\\" mode of the second game in the Game & Watch handheld series Flagman (Silver, 5th Jun 1980). \\"Game B\\" is the same, but doesn't play in a sequence, while the player has a limited time to press the corresponding number lit up. * R2-D2 Ditto Droid, a Star Wars version featuring R2-D2 sounds and Star Wars-themed graphics by Tiger Electronics, 1997. * Vtech's Wizard. * A side quest in both the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! that involves freeing creatures called \\"Banana Birds\\" using buttons on each system's controller. * Soviet Elektronika IE-01 Ivolga, nearly an exact visual replica of Simon. *Oddworld games, in which the playable character must progress by completing certain puzzles with a sequence of sounds. The same gameplay also appears on multi-game handhelds such as: *Tiger Electronics' Brain Warp and Brain Shift games: instead of tones, the game unit issues a recorded voice that calls out colors and numbers in Game 4 - Memory Match. Brain Shift has two memory games, Game 2 (Memory Shift) and Game 3 (Who Shift's It?), that call out colors. * Mego Corporation's Fabulous Fred (Game 3, The Memory Game). * Parker Brothers' Merlin (Game 3, Echo). * Atari also included a nine-button version of Touch Me as game variations 1-4 (out of 19) on the 1978 Brain Games cartridge for the Atari 2600. * A fan-made homebrew video game version of Simon was unofficially made available for modded Wiis in 2008. * A Harry Potter wand released in 2001 called Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge had Simon gameplay and voice commands: \\"Wingardium\\" (to tilt the wand down) and \\"Leviosa\\" (to tilt the wand up.). Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge Instruction Audio Some versions of the game have tones that play as long as the button is depressed, but others have a constant sound duration. Some versions feature audio themes, such as animals (cat/dog/pig/cow), xylophone, football and space sounds, some of which make the game easier to play. Some versions also have a sound on/off setting, which can make the game harder with only visual cues. In popular culture * In the 1987 Stephen King's novel The Tommyknockers, a forgotten Simon game left in the back seat of a reporter's car activates itself and, in an accelerated color-switching frenzy, overheats and melts its casing, scorching the seat beneath. The surprised driver then knocks it to the floor before it goes up in flames. * In the It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia episode \\"A Very Sunny Christmas\\", Mac finds the game in his closet and Charlie finds it extremely difficult. * In an episode of Little Miss Gamer, Simon causes the title character to meet Tom Green and Blackwolf the Dragon Master. * In the Family Guy episode \\"Perfect Castaway\\", Stewie plays with Simon and makes up his own song lyrics to the random key sequences. * In the American Dad! episode \\"The One That Got Away\\", the family becomes addicted to the game, playing it for days without moving. * In the film 2009 Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Flint, the main character, has to click the correct sequence on a Simon to get into his lab. * In the 2012 Cougar Town episode \\"You Can Still Change Your Mind\\", Ellie uses the game to taunt \\"Jelly Bean\\" (Laurie) about her intellectual shortcomings. * In the 2014 film Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, a Simon game is possessed by a demon and works as a mock ouija board. * In a Robot Chicken sketch, Dick Cheney's heart is replaced with a Simon, in a parody of Iron Man. * The concept was used as the bonus round in the British game show Ant & Dec's Push the Button. * A minigame resembling Simon appeared in the 2002 video game Sabrina the Teenage Witch: Potion Commotion for the Game Boy Advance. * A Simon game signed by Baer is on permanent display at the American Computer & Robotics Museum in Bozeman, Montana. * In the 2014 video game South Park: The Stick of Truth, the player plays Simon in order to rescue Randy Marsh from an alien probe. * The quick time event mechanic in the 2005 video game Indigo Prophecy was modeled after the toy. * Simon was among the bounty stolen by the 18th century pirates from the sailboat in the 1980 film (and Peter Benchley screenplay) The Island, with the pirates becoming frustrated by not being able to figure out how it worked. * Simon was used in the 2017 film Monster Trucks to demonstrate training the sea creatures captured by Terravex energy. * In Despicable Me 3, villain Balthazar Bratt, who has an arsenal of 1980s-themed gadgets, uses Simon as his alarm system. * In Season 6 of Silicon Valley, Nelson \\"Big Head\\" Bighetti spends days playing Simon during working hours at the Business Incubator, and unwittingly internalizes Jian-Yang's SSH key by singing the key's characters along with the lit colors in the game. * In late 2020, the popular game Among Us featured a mini-game loosely based on the design of Simon.

Most have three wheels and do not tilt. They are known by many terms in various countries including auto, auto/auto rickshaw taxi, baby taxi, pigeon, bajaj, chand gari, lapa, tuk-tuk, 3wheel or tukxi. The auto rickshaw is a common form of urban transport, both as a vehicle for hire and for private use, in many countries around the world. They are especially common in countries with tropical or subtropical climates, since they usually are not fully enclosed, and in many developing countries because they are relatively inexpensive to own and operate. As of 2019, Bajaj Auto of Pune, India is the world's largest auto rickshaw manufacturer, selling 780,000 during the fiscal year. There are many different auto rickshaw types, designs, and variations. The most common type is characterized by a sheet- metal body or open frame resting on three wheels; a canvas roof with drop-down side curtains; a small cabin at the front for the driver (in India, the auto- wallah or tuktuK-wallah), with handlebar controls; and a cargo, passenger, or dual purpose space at the rear. Another common type is a motorcycle that has an expanded sidecar or, less often, is pushing or pulling a passenger compartment. Origin Daihatsu Midget Model DKA In the 1930s Japan, which was the most industrialized country in east Asia at the time, encouraged the development of motorized vehicles including less expensive three-wheeled vehicles based on motorcycles. The Mazda-Go, a 3-wheel open \\"truck\\" released in 1931, is often considered the first of what became auto rickshaws. Later that decade the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of Japan distributed about 20,000 used three-wheelers to Southeast Asia as part of efforts to expand its influence in the region.„Éü„Çº„ÉÉ„ÉàÁâ©Ë™û Êú®Êùë‰ø°‰πã Ëëó È´òÂéüÊõ∏Â∫óÔºàNobuyuki Kimura \\"Story of Midget\\", Published on 10 November 1998ÔºâDaihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. public relations section/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=321:2009-11-30-05-34-59&catid;=54:2009-09-09-07-52-31&Itemid;=232 Royal Thai Embassy Tokyo, Japan Êó•Êú¨Áîü„Åæ„Çå„ÅÆ„Çø„Ç§„ÅÆ„Éà„Ç•„ÇØ„Éà„Ç•„ÇØ (Tuk-Tuk of Thailand was born in Japan.) They became popular in some areas, especially Thailand, which developed local manufacturing and design after three-wheelers went out of use in Japan when the Japanese Government abolished the three-wheeler license in 1965 . Production in Southeast Asia started from the knockdown production of the Daihatsu Midget, which was introduced in 1959. An exception is the indigenously-modified Philippine tricycle, which originates from the Rikuo Type 97 motorcycle with a sidecar, introduced to the islands in 1941 by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. In Europe, Corradino D'Ascanio, aircraft designer at Piaggio and inventor of the Vespa, came up with the idea of building a light three-wheeled commercial vehicle to power Italy's post-war economic reconstruction. The Piaggio Ape followed suit in 1947.  Regional variations   Africa and the Middle East  = Egypt = Locally named the \\"toktok,\\" the rickshaw is used to provide transportation in most parts of Egypt. = Gaza = Together with the recent boom of recreational facilities in Gaza for the local residents, donkey carts have all but been displaced by tuk-tuks in 2010. Due to the ban by Egypt and Israel on the import of most motorised vehicles, the tuk-tuks have had to be smuggled in parts through the tunnel network connecting Gaza with Egypt. = Madagascar = In Madagascar, man-powered rickshaws are a common form of transportation in a number of cities, especially Antsirabe. They are known as \\"posy\\" from pousse-pousse, meaning push-push. Cycle rickshaws took off since 2006 in a number of flat cities like Toamasina and replaced the major part of the posy, and are now threatened by the auto rickshaws, introduced in 2009. Provincial capitals like Toamasina, Mahajanga, Toliara, and Antsiranana are taking to them rapidly. They are known as \\"bajaji\\" in the north and \\"tuk-tuk\\" or \\"tik-tik\\" in the east, and are now licensed to operate as taxis. They are not yet allowed an operating licence in the congested, and more polluted national capital, Antananarivo. = Nigeria = Aerial view of autorickshaw congestion from a pedestrian bridge in Uyo, Southeast Nigeria The auto rickshaw is used to provide transportation in cities all over Nigeria. Popularity and use varies across the country however. In Lagos, for example, the \\"keke\\" (Yoruba for bicycle) is regulated and transportation around the state's highways is prohibited. = South Africa = Tuk-Tuk in Hermanus, South Africa (2014) Tuk- tuks, introduced in Durban in the late 1980s enjoyed growing popularity in recent years, particularly in Gauteng. In Cape Town they are used to deliver groceries and, more recently, transport tourists. Rickshaw in Omdurman (Sudan) = Sudan = Rickshaws, known as \\"Raksha\\" in Sudan, is the most common mean of transportation followed by the bus in the capital Khartoum. = Tanzania = Rickshaws are locally known as \\"bajaji\\" and are a common mode of transportation in Dar es Salaam. = Zimbabwe = Hende Moto electric 3 Wheeler Zimbabwe Hende Moto Taxi were first introduced in Zimbabwe as the first car manufactured by a Zimbabwean three wheeler manufacturing company Hende Moto Pvt Ltd, Hende Moto Engine in a Safari fiberglass body. The first Hende Moto Taxi was introduced in Kwekwe August 2019, Zimbabwe and thereafter, Victoria Falls City came second and lastly Harare 2019. Hende Moto is also the manufacturer of the first Zimbabwean made electric passenger three wheeled vehicle. It operates on a lithium ion battery that has a range of 70 miles on a 6-hour charge.  South Asia  =Afghanistan= A tuk-tuk in Herat Auto rickshaws are very common in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, where they are popularly decorated in art and colors. They are also popular in the northern city of Kunduz. = Bangladesh = \\"CNGs\\" in Dhaka Auto rickshaws (locally called \\"baby taxis\\" and more recently \\"CNGs\\" due to their fuel source, compressed natural gas) are one of the more popular modes of transport in Bangladesh mainly due to their size and speed. They are best suited to narrow, crowded streets, and are thus the principal means of covering longer distances within urban areas. Two-stroke engines had been identified as one of the leading sources of air pollution in Dhaka. Thus, since January 2003, traditional auto rickshaws were banned from the capital; only the new natural gas-powered models (CNG) were permitted to operate within the city limits. All CNGs are painted green to signify that the vehicles are eco-friendly and that each one has a meter built-in. =India = Most cities offer auto rickshaw service, although cycle rickshaws are also common and even hand-pulled rickshaws exist in certain areas such as Kolkata. Many state governments have launched an initiative of women friendly rickshaw service called the Pink Rickshaws . Auto rickshaws are used in cities and towns for short distances; they are less suited to long distances because they are slow and the carriages are open to air pollution. Auto rickshaws (often called \\"autos\\") provide cheap and efficient transportation. Modern auto rickshaws run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) due to government regulations and are environmentally friendly compared to full-sized cars. To augment speedy movement of traffic, auto rickshaws are not allowed in the southern part of Mumbai. India is the location of the annual Rickshaw Run. There are two types of auto rickshaws in India. In older versions the engines were below the driver's seat, while in newer versions engines are in the rear. They normally run on petrol, CNG, or diesel. The seating capacity of a normal rickshaw is four, including the driver's seat. Six-seater rickshaws exist in different parts of the country, but the model was officially banned in the city of Pune on 10 January 2003 by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). CNG autos in many cities (e.g. Delhi, Agra) are distinguishable from the earlier petrol- powered autos by a green and yellow livery, as opposed to the earlier black and yellow appearance. In other cities (such as Mumbai) the only distinguishing feature is the 'CNG' print found on the back or side of the auto. Some local governments are considering four-stroke engines instead of two-stroke versions. Auto rickshaw manufacturers in India include Bajaj Auto, Atul Auto Limited, Kerala Automobiles Limited, Force Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Piaggio Ape, TVS Motors and Fleek Motors. Besides conventional autos, in Delhi there also used to be a variant powered by a Harley-Davidson engine called the phat-phati, because of the characteristic‚Äîand quite loud‚Äîsound it made. The story goes that shortly after Independence a stock of Harley-Davidson motorbikes were found that had been used by British troops during World War II and left behind in a military storage house in Delhi. Some enterprising drivers purchased these bikes, added on a gear box (probably from a Willys jeep), welded on a passenger compartment that was good for four to six passengers, and put the highly unusual and unconventional vehicles onto the roads. A 1998 ruling of the Supreme Court against the use of polluting vehicles finally signed the death warrant of Delhi's phat-phatis. India has about 1.5 million battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws on its roads. Some 11,000 new ones hit the streets each month, creating a US$1.5 billion market. Manufacturers include Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Kinetic Engineering. A hindrance to adoption to electric vehicles is the paucity of charging stations; India had only 425 at year-end 2017. By 2022 the number is projected to rise to 2,800.

They have also gone on strike multiple times in Delhi to protest against the government and High Court's 2012 order to install GPS systems, and even though GPS installation in public transport was made mandatory in 2015, as of 2017 compliance remains very low. = Nepal = Auto rickshaws were a popular mode of transport in Nepal during the 1980s and 1990s, until the government banned the movement of 600 such vehicles in the early 2000s. The earliest auto rickshaws running in Kathmandu were manufactured by Bajaj Auto. Nepal has been a popular destination for the Rickshaw Run. The 2009 Fall Run took place in Goa, India and ended in Pokhara, Nepal. = Pakistan = Auto rickshaws are a popular mode of transport in Pakistani towns and are mainly used for travelling short distances within cities. One of the major manufacturers of auto rickshaws is Piaggio. The government is taking measures to convert all gasoline powered auto rickshaws to cleaner CNG rickshaws by 2015 in all the major cities of Pakistan by issuing easy loans through commercial banks. Environment Canada is implementing pilot projects in Lahore, Karachi, and Quetta with engine technology developed in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada that uses CNG instead of gasoline in the two-stroke engines, in an effort to combat environmental pollution and noise levels. In many cities in Pakistan, there are also motorcycle rickshaws, usually called \\"chand gari\\" (moon car) or \\"chingchi\\", after the Chinese company Jinan Qingqi Motorcycle Co. Ltd who first introduced these to the market. There are many rickshaw manufacturers in Pakistan. Lahore is the hub of CNG auto rickshaw manufacturing. Manufacturers include: New Asia automobile Pvt, Ltd; AECO Export Company; STAHLCO Motors; Global Sources; Parhiyar Automobiles; Global Ledsys Technologies; Siwa Industries; Prime Punjab Automobiles; Murshid Farm Industries; Sazgar Automobiles; NTN Enterprises; and Imperial Engineering Company.

Sri Lankan three-wheelers are of the style of the light Phnom Penh-type. Most of the three-wheelers in Sri Lanka are a slightly modified Indian Bajaj model, imported from India though there are few manufactured locally and increasingly imports from other countries in the region and other brands of three-wheelers such as Piaggio Ape. a new gasoline powered tuk-tuk typically costs around , while a newly introduced Chinese electric model cost around . Since 2008, the Sri Lankan government has banned the import of all 2-stroke gasoline engines, due to environmental concerns. Ones imported to the island now are four-stroke engines. Most three-wheelers are available as hired vehicles, with few being used to haul goods or as private company or advertising vehicles. Bajaj enjoys a virtual monopoly in the island, with its agent being David Pieries Motor Co, Ltd. A few three- wheelers in Sri Lanka have distance meters. In the capital city it is becoming more and more common. The vast majority of fares are negotiated between the passenger and driver. There are 1.2 million trishaw's in Sri Lanka and most are on financial loans.

It is a widely used form of transportation in the capital of Phnom Penh and for visitors touring the Angkor temples in Siem Reap. Some have four wheels and is composed of a motorcycle (which leans) and trailer (which does not). Cambodian cities have a much lower volume of automobile traffic than Thai cities, and tuk-tuks are still the most common form of urban transport. There are more than 6,000 tuk-tuks in Phnom Penh, according to the Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association (IDEA), a union that represents tuk-tuk drivers among other members.

In Jakarta, the auto rickshaws are called Bajay or Bajaj and they are the same to as the ones in India but are colored blue (for the ones which use Compressed natural gas) and orange (for the ones which use normal gasoline fuel). The blue ones are imported from India with the brand of Bajaj and TVS and the orange ones are the old design from 1990 and are not powered by gas like the blue ones, yet the government is increasing units of the blue Bajays and is step by step decreasing the orange bajays. The Bajaj is one of the most popular modes of transportation in the city. Outside of Jakarta, the bentor- style auto rickshaw is ubiquitous, with the passenger cabin mounted as a sidecar (like in Medan) or in-front (like the ones in some parts of Sulawesi) to a motorcycle.

Unlike auto rickshaws, however, it has a motorcycle with a sidecar configuration and a different origin. The exact date of its appearance in the Philippines is unknown, but it started appearing after World War 2, roughly at the same time as the appearance of the jeepney. It is most likely derived from the Rikuo Type 97 military motorcycle used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines starting at 1941. The motorcycle was essentially a licensed copy of a Harley-Davidson with a sidecar. However, there is also another hypothesis which places the origin of the tricycle to the similarly built \\"trisikad\\", a human-powered cycle rickshaw built in the same configuration as the tricycle. However, the provenance of the trisikad is also unknown. Prior to the tricycles and trisikad, the most common means of mass public transport in the Philippines is a carriage pulled by horses or carabaos known as the kalesa (calesa or carromata in Philippine Spanish). The pulled rickshaw never gained acceptance in the Philippines. Americans tried to introduce it in the early 20th century, but it was strongly opposed by local Filipinos who viewed it as an undignified mode of transport that turned humans into \\"beasts\\". The design and configuration of tricycles vary widely from place to place, but tends towards rough standardization within each municipality. The usual design is a passenger or cargo sidecar fitted to a motorbike, usually on the right of the motorbike. It is rare to find one with a left sidecar. A larger variant of the tricycle with the motorcycle in the center enclosed by a passenger cab with two side benches is known as a \\"motorela.\\" It is found in the islands of Mindanao, Camiguin, and Bohol. Another notable variant are the tricycles of the Batanes Islands which have cabs made from wood and roofed with thatched cogon grass. In Pagadian City, tricycles are also uniquely built with the passenger cab slanting upwards, due to the city's streets that run along steep hills. Tricycles can carry three passengers or more in the sidecar, one or two pillion passengers behind the driver, and even a few on the roof of the sidecar. Tricycles are one of the main contributors to air pollution in the Philippines, which account for 45% of all volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions since majority of them employ two-stroke engines. However, some local governments are working towards phasing out two-stroke tricycles for ones with cleaner four-stroke engines. Tuk-tuks (which are still called tricycles locally despite having a completely different technical composition) and electric variants thereof are now seen in Philippine streets, especially in the city of Manila, called e-trikes, for the latter. Combustion engine tuktuks are locally distributed by Bajaj Auto through dealerships File:Tricycle-Philippines-Dumaguete.JPGMotorized tricycle, Dumaguete City File:Kalibo trike.JPG7-passenger tricycle with large sidecar, Province of Aklan File:Banaue Philippines Local-Taxi-01.jpgTricycle stand, Banaue Municipal Town = Thailand = The auto rickshaw, called tuk- tuk (, ) in Thailand, is a widely used form of urban transport in Bangkok and other Thai cities. The name is onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of a small (often two-cycle) engine. An equivalent English term would be \\"putt-putt\\". It is particularly popular where traffic congestion is a major problem, such as in Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima. Drivers may also use their tuk-tuks to transport fresh produce or other goods around the city in absence of passengers. Bangkok and other cities in Thailand have many tuk-tuks which are a more open variation on the Indian auto rickshaw. About 20,000 tuk-tuks are registered as taxis in Thailand. Bangkok alone is reported to have 9,000 tuk- tuks. Tuk-tuk hua kob (‡∏ï‡∏∏‡πä‡∏Å ‡πÜ ‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏ö; literally: frog-headed tuk tuk) is a unique tuk tuk with a cab looking like a frog's head. Only Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya and Trang have vehicles like this.

They may be used to transport cargo or passengers in the more rural areas. However, in many urban areas the auto rickshaws for passengers are often operated illegally as they are considered unsafe and an eyesore. They are permitted in some towns and cities, however. The Southeast Asian word tuk tuk is transliterated as d≈´ d≈´ chƒì (ÂòüÂòüËΩ¶, or beep beep car) in Chinese.  Europe  = France = A number of tuk-tuks (250 in 2013 according to the Paris Prefecture) are used as an alternative tourist transport system in Paris, some of them being pedal-operated with electric motor assist. They are not yet fully licensed to operate and await customers on the streets. V√©lotaxis were common during the Occupation years in Paris due to fuel restrictions. = Italy = An Ape C (1956‚Äì1967) Auto rickshaws have been commonly used in Italy since the late 1940s, providing a low-cost means of transportation in the post‚ÄìWorld War II years when the country was short of economic resources. The Piaggio Ape (Tukxi), designed by Vespa creator Corradino D'Ascanio and first manufactured in 1948 by the Italian company Piaggio, though primarily designed for carrying freight has also been widely used as an auto rickshaw. It is still extremely popular throughout the country, being particularly useful in the narrow streets found in the center of many little towns in central and southern Italy. Though it no longer has a key role in transportation, Piaggio Ape is still used as a minitaxi in some areas such as the islands of Ischia and Stromboli (on Stromboli no cars are allowed). It has recently been re-launched as a trendy-ecological means of transportation, or, relying on the role the Ape played in the history of Italian design, as a promotional tool. Since 2006 the Ape has been produced under licence in India. =Portugal= Tuk Tuk Taxi in Albufeira Portugal Tuk Tuks are used in the resort city of Albufeira in the Algarve as a novel form of transport for visitors during the tourist season. = United Kingdom = Tuk Tuks & Auto Rickshaws were introduced into the UK by Tukshop in 2004. Founded by mrsteve the first shipments of Bajaj vehicles arrived in Southampton where they were assembled and modified for UK road use. Tuctucs booking auto rickshaw at Brighton Marina In 2006 a British travel writer Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent and her friend Jo Huxster travelled 12,561 miles (20,215 km) with an auto rickshaw from Bangkok to Brighton. With this 98 days' trip they set a Guinness World Record for the longest journey ever with an auto rickshaw.  Central America  Bajaj mototaxis in El Salvador = El Salvador = The mototaxi or moto is the El Salvadoran version of the auto rickshaw. These are most commonly made from the front end and engine of a motorcycle attached to a two-wheeled passenger area in back. Commercially produced models, such as the Indian Bajaj brand, are also employed. = Guatemala = In Guatemala tuk-tuks operate, both as taxis and private vehicles, in Guatemala City, around the island town of Flores, Peten, in the mountain city of Antigua Guatemala, and in many small towns in the mountains. In 2005 the tuk-tuks were prevalent in the Lago de Atitl√°n towns of Panajachel and Santiago Atitl√°n.  North America  Westcoaster Mailster = United States = In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Post Office (replaced in 1971 by the United States Postal Service) used the WestCoaster Mailster, a close relative of the tuk-tuk. Similar vehicles remain in limited use for parking enforcement, mall security, and other niche applications. =Cuba= In Cuba, the autorickshaws are small and look like a coconut, hence the name Cocotaxi. Cocotaxis in Havana, Cuba  South America  = Peru = In Peru, a version of this vehicle is called a motocarhttp://www.peru- motor.com/motocar/ or mototaxi.  Fuel efficiency and pollution  A CNG Auto-rickshaw in New Delhi In July 1998, the Supreme Court of India ordered the Government of Delhi to implement CNG or LPG (Autogas) fuel for all autos and for the entire bus fleet in and around the city. Delhi's air quality has improved with the switch to CNG. Initially, auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi had to wait in long queues for CNG refueling, but the situation improved following an increase in the number of CNG stations. Gradually, many state governments passed similar laws, thus shifting to CNG or LPG vehicles in most large cities to improve air quality and reduce pollution. Certain local governments are pushing for four-stroke engines instead of two-stroke ones. Typical mileage for an Indian-made auto rickshaw is around of petrol. Pakistan has passed a similar law prohibiting auto rickshaws in certain areas. CNG auto rickshaws have started to appear in huge numbers in many Pakistani cities. In January 2007 the Sri Lankan government also banned two-stroke trishaws to reduce air pollution. In the Philippines there are projects to convert carburated two- stroke engines to direct-injected via Envirofit technology. Research has shown LPG or CNG gas direct-injection can be retrofitted to existing engines, in similar fashion to the Envirofit system. In Vigan City majority of tricycles- for-hire as of 2008 are powered by motorcycles with four-stroke engines, as tricycles with two-stroke motorcycles are prevented from receiving operating permits. Direct injection is standard equipment on new machines in India. In March 2009 an international consortium coordinated by the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies initiated a two-year public-private partnership of local and international stakeholders aiming at operating a fleet of 15 hydrogen-fueled three-wheeled vehicles in New Delhi's Pragati Maidan complex. As of January 2011, the project was nearing completion. Hydrogen internal combustion (HICV) use in three-wheelers has only recently being started to be looked into, mainly by developing countries, to decrease local pollution at an affordable cost.Clean Hydrogen Technology for 3-Wheel Transportation in India At some point, Bajaj Auto made a HICV auto rickshaw together with the company \\"Energy Conversion Devices\\". They made a report on it called \\"Clean Hydrogen Technology for 3-Wheel Transportation in India\\" and it stated that the performance was comparable with CNG autos. In 2012, Mahindra & Mahindra showcased their first HICV auto rickshaw, called the Mahindra HyAlfa. The development of the hydrogen-powered rickshaw happened with support from the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies.

The lake is almost long and more than wide. It is a glacial lake, formed in a glacially 'over- deepened' valley. It is the deepest lake in EnglandThe Lake District National Park Authority at . The surface of the lake is about above sea level, while its bottom is over below sea level. It is owned by the National Trust. Surroundings The head of the Wasdale Valley is surrounded by some of the highest mountains in England, including Scafell Pike, Great Gable and Lingmell. The steep slopes on the southeastern side of the lake, leading up to the summits of Whin Rigg and Illgill Head, are known as the \\"Wastwater Screes\\" or on some maps as \\"The Screes\\". These screes formed as a result of ice and weathering erosion on the rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, that form the fells to the east of the lake, towards Eskdale. They are approximately , from top to base, the base being about below the surface of the lake. A path runs the length of the lake, through the boulders and scree fall at the base of the craggy fell-side. On the northwestern side are the cliffs of Buckbarrow (a part of Seatallan) and the upturned-boat shape of Yewbarrow. Wast Water is the source of the River Irt which flows into the Irish Sea near Ravenglass. Both the lake and Wasdale Screes are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and under European Union law as Special Areas of Conservation. Name origin and pronunciation \\"Wastwater\\" comes from \\"Wasdale\\" plus English \\"water\\". \\" 'Wasdale lake' or 'the lake of Vatns√°, lake river'. The present name rather curiously contains the reflexes of both Old Norse 'vatn' 'water', 'lake', and Old English 'w√¶ter' 'water', with the meaning 'lake' probably influenced by the Old Norse 'vatn'. The valley is pronounced as in was, not with a hard a: the name of the lake similarly but with a soft \\"s\\" as in \\"thou wast\\". The lake is named \\"Wast Water\\" on Ordnance Survey maps but the spelling \\"Wastwater\\" is used with roughly equal frequency, including by its owner, the National Trust, along with the Cumbria Tourist Board, and the Lake District National Park Authority. Points of interest =The Lady in the Lake= In 1976, The Wasdale Lady in the Lake, Margaret Hogg, was murdered by her husband and her body was disposed of in the lake. She was found after eight years, with her body preserved like wax due to the lack of oxygen in the water.Lakestay, Wasdale's Lady in the Lake Mystery =Underwater gnomes= In February 2005 it was reported that a \\"gnome garden\\" complete with picket fence had been placed in the lake as a point of interest for divers to explore. It was removed from the bottom of Wastwater after three divers died in the late 1990s. It is thought the divers spent too much time too deep searching for the ornaments. Police divers report a rumour that the garden had been replaced at a depth beyond the lowest they were allowed to dive. PC Kenny McMahon, a member of the North West Police Underwater Search Unit, said =Water extraction= Water was first pumped from the lake during World War II to supply the Royal Ordnance Factory at Drigg.

The term generally refers to the suburbs located on the northern side of Sydney Harbour up to Hornsby and between Middle Harbour and the Lane Cove River.  History  Before British settlement, the Lower North Shore was home to the Gorualgal (Mosman and southern Willoughby) and Cammeraygal (North Sydney and Eastern Lane Cove).http://www.inside-sydney-australia.com/port-jackson.html After the establishment of Sydney in 1788, settlement on the North Shore of the harbour was quite limited. One of the first settlers was James Milson who lived in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli, directly opposite Sydney Cove. The north shore was more rugged than the southern shore and western areas of the harbour and had limited agricultural potential. The early activities in the area included tree felling, boatbuilding and some orchard farming in the limited areas of good soil. The North Shore railway line was built in the 1890s. Access to the Sydney CBD, located on the southern shore of the harbour remained difficult until the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. This led to the commencement of the development of suburbs on the North Shore. https://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/Library_Databases/Heritage_Centre/Leaflets_Walks_Publications/We_will_see_a_town_rising_A_history_of_North_Sydney The four local governments that together form the Lower North Shore (the City of Willoughby and the municipalities of Mosman, Lane Cove and North Sydney) were created from the Parish of Willoughby, a cadastral unit used for land titles that was created in the early years of European settlement. \\"North Sydney\\" was formerly known as St. Leonards. https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32553174?selectedversion=NBD42302430  Geography  Chatswood is a regional administrative and shopping district in the North Shore Suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the North Shore region can be somewhat amorphous and variable. However, the North Shore usually includes suburbs directly north of Sydney Harbour, west of Middle Harbour and Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and suburbs neighbouring Lane Cove National Park to the west of the region. Most of the North Shore suburbs are part of the Hornsby Plateau, a large sandstone plateau overlaid by a system of ridges and gullies. The Plateau begins north of the Port Jackson and runs up until the Hawkesbury River. Thus much of the North Shore is hilly with many steep valleys running down into the harbour and the rivers on either side. Parks and areas of sclerophyll forest are present throughout the area, earning it the nickname \\"the leafy North Shore\\". The Lane Cove National Park, Garigal National Park and Sydney Harbour National Park contain remnant bushland along the Lane Cove River, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour respectively. Bushwalking, abseiling and bouldering opportunities can be found around Lindfield and North Turramurra. Gordon has one of Sydney's largest bat colonies in a bat reserve leading to Middle Harbour. http://www.kmc.nsw.gov.au/About_Ku-ring- gai/Land_and_surrounds/Wildlife_and_fauna/Native_species_profiles/Grey- headed_flying-fox = Upper North Shore = The \\"Upper North Shore\\" usually refers to the suburbs between Roseville and Hornsby, or suburbs adjoining the upper section of Lane Cove National Park, and suburbs located to the West of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. It is located to the north-west of the Sydney CBD. It is made up of suburbs located within the Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Council areas. In 2015, the NSW government proposed merging Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Councils. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers on the North Shore. = Lower North Shore = The Lower North Shore generally refers to suburbs adjacent to the northern side of Sydney Harbour and suburbs west of Middle Harbour, North to Chatswood, New South Wales and suburbs surrounding Lane Cove River such as Woolwich and Riverview. The Lower North Shore roughly corresponds with the Parish of Willoughby, a cadastral unit used for land title purposes. Local government areas that make up the Lower North Shore include Mosman Council, City of Willoughby, Municipality of Lane Cove, North Sydney Council, Municipality of Hunters Hill and parts of City of Ryde. In 2016, the NSW government proposed merging three of the four lower north shore councils (Mosman, Willoughby, and North Sydney councils). In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman local government areas. The other lower north shore council, Lane Cove, was similarly proposed to be merged with nearby Hunters Hill and Ryde councils, but that plan was also eventually abandoned. The Lower North Shore suburbs adjacent to Sydney Harbour are Neutral Bay, Greenwich, Waverton, Wollstonecraft, Mosman, Cremorne, Lavender Bay, Milsons Point, Cammeray, and North Sydney.  Transport  The main transport routes on the North Shore are Military Road, the Pacific Highway, the Warringah Expressway as well as parts of the Pennant Hills Road, Ryde Road, Epping Road and Mona Vale Road. Smaller but major arterial roads on the Upper North Shore include the Eastern Arterial Road at St Ives, East Killara and East Lindfield, the Comenarra Parkway at Thornleigh, Wahroonga, Turramurra, South Turramurra and West Pymble, as well as Lady Game Drive at West Pymble, Gordon, Killara, Lindfield and West Chastwood, providing access to major commercial hubs such as Chatswood. The North Shore & Western Line provides access to the central business district of Sydney over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Many bus routes also serve the area, particularly the lower North Shore, and ferries connect many of the harbourside suburbs with Circular Quay in the central business districthttps://transportnsw.info/document/4247/state-transit-north-shore-and- west-network-map_0.pdf. Much of the North Shore is accessible to Railway Transport with the T1 North Shore line providing rail services between Sydney's Central Business District, North Sydney and Hornsby via Chatswood. The T9 Northern Line also serves parts of the Upper North Shore, while the Sydney Metro Northwest which opened on 26 May 2018, serves the suburbs of Chatswood, North Ryde, Macquarie Park, Macquarie University and Epping before continuing to in the Hills District, replacing the previous Epping to Chatswood railway line after almost 10 years of service. The remaining Sydney Metro City & Southwest stage to the Lower North Shore and , is projected to be completed in 2024. The completed metro line will provide rapid transit between North West Sydney and South West Sydney via the Lower North Shore. Transdev NSW provide frequent bus services to the Upper North Shore.Upper North Shore timetables Transdev NSW Busses on the Lower North Shore are mainly serviced by the State Transit Authority.https://transportnsw.info/document/1695/region- guide-sydney-northern-beaches-lower-north-shore.pdf  Commercial areas  Significant commercial and retail centres on the North Shore include North Sydney, Crows Nest, Macquarie Park, Chatswood, St Leonards, Neutral Bay, Gordon and Hornsby. The North Shore's largest commercial centres are at North Sydney and Chatswood. A number of international companies having their Australian or Asia‚ÄìPacific Headquarters in this part of Sydney. North Sydney does not have any of Sydney's major shopping centres, however, it has a number of speciality stores and caf√©s. Chatswood is one of the largest retail precincts in Sydney, and has a large amount of high density residential buildings. It is home to large shopping centres such as Westfield Chatswood and Chatswood Chase. Nearby Chatswood, Macquarie Park is home to one of Sydney‚Äôs largest shopping centres, Macquarie Centre. Macquarie Park also has a substantial amount of high density residential buildings and office space. St Leonards is another large commercial area featuring mostly office space and apartments.  Attractions  The Lower North Shore has many unique landmarks such as: The Sydney Harbour Bridge, Taronga Zoo in Mosman, Admiralty House (Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia), Kirribilli House (Sydney residence of the Prime Minister of Australia), Luna Park, and Balmoral Beach. At a Sydney or local level, however, landmarks are more plentiful and include: The Lane Cove Azalea Beds, Blues Point Tower, Eden Gardens, the Balmoral Rotunda, the Stanton Library in North Sydney, Lane Cove Plaza, Zenith Towers at Chatswood, Northpoint Tower in North Sydney, Cammeray suspension bridge at Cammeray, Echo Point Park in Roseville Chase, the Royal North Shore Hospital, the Hornsby Water Clock, and 'The Forum' in St Leonards.https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/australia/articles/top-things-to- see-and-do-north-of-the-bridge-in-sydney/ The region is home to hundreds of parks and reserves, including Sydney Harbour National Park and the Lane Cove National Park. Major local sports grounds include North Sydney Oval, the region's largest in capacity, and Chatswood Oval.  Events and celebrations  The Willoughby Spring Festival is held throughout the Willoughby local government area, in September each year. The festival lasts for a month and features over 40 events including live music/entertainment, exhibitions, cultural celebrations, business events and many more community activities. The highlight is the annual Willoughby StreetFair where the Chatswood CBD is taken over by market stalls, performers, dancers and musicians. The StreetFair features the Willoughby Street Parade which included over 1,000 participants in 2007. The Lower North Shore's other main festivals/events include: Tartan Day at Lane Cove, the Guringgai Festival honouring northern Sydney's Aboriginals, the Moocooboola Festival at Hunters Hill, the Mosman Festival, Lane Cove's Cammeraygal Festival, Chinese New Year at Chatswood. Mosman, North Sydney, Willoughby also holds an annual art prize. All local government areas in the region and around the country celebrate Australia Day, which is on 26 January.https://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/sydney-north/events  Media  The local newspapers are the Sydney Observer, Hornsby and Upper North Shore Advocate, The North Shore Times, The Mosman Daily, Northern District Times and the North Shores' local lifestyle publication Northside.  Climate  Like the rest of the Sydney basin, the North Shore has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cfa). Turramurra receives one of the highest rainfalls in the Sydney area, with an average of per year. The inland parts of the North Shore are somewhat cooler than other areas of the surrounding Sydney basin in the winter months, particularly the CBD, and the further inland the area (particularly the Upper North Shore), the cooler the weather.

Taree and nearby Cundletown were settled in 1831 by William Wynter. Since then Taree has grown to a population of 26,381, and is the centre of a significant agricultural district. It is 16 km from the Tasman Sea coast, and 317 km north of Sydney. Taree can be reached by train via the North Coast Railway, and by the Pacific Highway. Taree railway station is on the North Coast line of the NSW TrainLink network. It is serviced by six NSW TrainLink trains daily: three heading to Sydney, another three heading North to Grafton, Casino or Brisbane. Taree is within the local government area of Mid-Coast Council, the state electorate of Myall Lakes and the Federal electorate of Lyne. Name The name Taree is derived from \\"tareebit\\", a Biripi word meaning tree by the river, or more specifically, the Sandpaper Fig (Ficus coronata). History The Biripi were the indigenous people of what is now known as Taree. The Aboriginal population of the Manning River was relatively dense before colonisation by Europeans. In 1826, Assistant Surveyor Henry Dangar was instructed by John Oxley as Surveyor General (and a shareholder in the Australian Agricultural Company) to survey the land between Port Stephens and the Hastings River. During this expedition, Dangar identified that 'Harrington Lake' was a river with two entrances to the sea. Later in 1826, the river was named the Manning River by Robert Dawson for the Deputy Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company, William Manning.The Present State of Australia by Robert Dawson, page 372 In 1829, Governor Darling proclaimed the division of the settlement of the colony of New South Wales into nineteen counties. The northern limit of the settlement was declared to be the Manning River. Taree was laid out as a private town in 1854 by Henry Flett, the son- in-law of William Wynter who had originally settled the area in 1831. had been set aside for the private township and 40 lots were initially sold. Taree was declared a municipality on 26 March 1885 and the first municipal council was elected by the residents.\\"Taree, a short factual history 1854-1954: a century of progress\\", Taree Centenary Celebrations Committee, 1954 In the early 1800s the road from Newcastle to Port Macquarie came via Gloucester and forded the river near Wingham. Boats could not go further upstream than this due to narrowing of the river and rapids. Hence a town formed at Wingham, about a day's ride from Gloucester. Timber getting, especially cedar, ensured goods were brought to Wingham and then shipped to Newcastle and beyond by boat. Coopernook similarly formed a local shipping hub. In 1844, the government of New South Wales had established Wingham as its administrative centre. When the North Coast railway line came through in 1913, it ended initially at Taree. Even before the rest of the line was completed it became apparent that it was safer to send goods by rail to Newcastle and Sydney rather than hazarding the bar at the outlet to the river at Harrington where many ships had been lost. Although connected to the railway, sea transport continued to dominate along the North Coast until the 1930s. This changed when the Martin Bridge replaced the ferry across the Manning River in 1940. River traffic significantly reduced after this, ensuring Taree's place as the centre of business. The oldest surviving building in Taree is the old St Paul's Presbyterian Church, built-in 1869 in the Victorian Gothic Revival style, next door to the current building, in Albert Street.  Heritage listings  Taree has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * North Coast railway: Taree railway station Climate Taree experiences a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Climate Classification: Cfa).

Tourism The Big Oyster A local tourist attraction is a building called \\"The World's Largest Oyster\\", also called \\"The Big Oyster\\". Big Things are a common form of tourist attraction in Australia. Like the Big Merino and Big Banana, the 'Oyster' is an artifact based on local produce; the Manning River produced oysters during 2013. The Big Oyster was an unsuccessful business venture, known to the locals as a 'Big Mistake', and is now home to a motor dealership. The Manning Entertainment Centre was built in the 1980s as the cultural centre of the district. It seats 505 people and has previously presented artists such as the Sydney Symphony Orchestra,http://www.manningrivertimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/sydney- symphony-brings-its-magic-to-taree/2575968.aspx the Australian Ballet and Dame Joan Sutherland. Local performers, including the district eisteddfod and local amateur dramatic societies, use it to provide cultural opportunities for the local community. Located next to the Entertainment Centre and the Visitor Information Centre at the northern entrance to Taree is the Manning Aquatic and Leisure Centre. This facility includes a 25-metre indoor heated pool with slippery dip and a 50-metre outdoor pool and soon after the time of opening had the second most expensive pool entrance fee in Australia, the most expensive being a pool in , Western Australia. The Aquatic Centre was built in the late 1990s ‚Äì early 2000s to replace the Taree Pool, which has been redeveloped into a public park with outdoor stage. The Manning Regional Art Gallery is located in a cottage-style building next to Taree Public School. The art gallery hosts a changing selection of works by local artists and visiting exhibitions. Nearby towns include historic Wingham, Tinonee, and the beachside town of Old Bar.

It has no official boundaries but is roughly bounded by Kensington High Street to the south, Holland Road to the west, Holland Park Avenue to the north, and Kensington Church Street to the east. Adjacent districts are Notting Hill to the north, Earl's Court to the south, and Shepherd's Bush to the northwest. The area is principally composed of tree-lined streets with large Victorian townhouses, and contains many shops, cultural tourist attractions such as the Design Museum, luxury spas, hotels, and restaurants, as well as the embassies of several countries. The street of Holland Park is formed from three linked roads constructed between 1860 and 1880 in projects of master builders William and Francis Radford, who were contracted to build and built over 200 houses in the area. Notable nineteenth-century residential developments in the area include the Royal Crescent and Aubrey House.  History  A map showing the Holland ward of Kensington Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. The district was rural until the 19th century, and most of the area now referred to by the name Holland Park was formerly the grounds of a Jacobean mansion called Holland House. In the later decades of that century the owners of the house sold off the more outlying parts of its grounds for residential development, and the district which evolved took its name from the house. It also included some small areas around the fringes which had never been part of the grounds of Holland House, notably the Phillimore Estate (there are at least four roads with the word Phillimore in their name) and the Campden Hill Square area. In the late 19th century a number of notable artists (including Frederic Leighton, P.R.A. and Val Prinsep) and art collectors lived in the area, known as the Holland Park Circle.  The public park  The park covers about , with a northern half of semi-wild woodland, central section of formal garden areas, and southernmost section used for sport. Holland House is now a fragmentary ruin, having been devastated by incendiary bombing during the Second World War in 1940, but the ruins and the grounds were bought by London County Council in 1952 from the last private owner, the 6th Earl of Ilchester. Today the remains of the house form a backdrop for the open air Holland Park Theatre, which is the home of Opera Holland Park. To the immediate south of the park is the former site of the Commonwealth Institute, now home to the Design Museum. The park contains a caf√©, as well as the Belvedere Restaurant that is attached to the orangery, a giant chess set, a cricket pitch, tennis courts, two Japanese gardens - the Kyoto Garden (1991) and Fukushima Memorial Garden (2012), a youth hostel, a children's playground, squirrels and peacocks. In 2010, the park set aside a section for pigs whose job was to reclaim the area from nettles etc., in order to create another meadow area for wild flowers and fauna. Cattle were used subsequently to similar effect. The Holland Park Ecology Centre (2013), operated by the borough's Ecology Service, offers environmental education programs including nature walks, talks, programs for schools and outdoor activity programs for children.

Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats. For example, about 1 in 30,000 people have monochromatic vision because the color-sensitive cone cells in their eyes do not function. Affected people can distinguish light, dark, and shades of gray but not color. Many species, such as marine mammals, the owl monkey and the Australian sea lion (pictured at right) are monochromats under normal conditions. In humans, absence of color discrimination or poor color discrimination is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, as for example inherited achromatopsia, acquired achromatopsia or inherited blue cone monochromacy. Humans Vision in humans is due to a system that includes rod and cone photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells and the visual cortex in the brain. Color vision is primarily achieved through cone cells. Cone cells are more concentrated in the fovea centralis, which is the central portion of the retina. This allows greater spatial resolution and color discrimination. Rod cells are concentrated in the periphery of the human retina. Rod cells are more light sensitive than cone cells, and are mainly responsible for scotopic (night) vision. Cones in most humans have three types of opsins with different spectral sensitivities which allow for trichromatic color discrimination, whereas rods all have a similar, broad spectral response which does not allow for color discrimination. Because of the distribution of rods and cones in the human eye, people have good color vision near the fovea (where cones are) but not in the periphery (where the rods are). These types of color blindness can be inherited, resulting from alterations in cone pigments or in other proteins needed for the process of phototransduction: # Anomalous trichromacy, when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity but trichromacy (distinguishing color by both the green-red and blue-yellow distinctions) is not fully impaired. # Dichromacy, when one of the cone pigments is missing and colour is reduced to the green-red distinction only or the blue-yellow distinction only. # Monochromacy, when two of the cones are not functional. Vision reduced to blacks, whites, and greys. # Rod monochromacy (achromatopsia), when all three of the cones are non functional and light perception is achieved only with rod cells. Color vision is heavily or completely impaired, vision reduced to seeing only the level of light coming from an object. Dyschromatopsia is a less severe type of achromatopsia. Monochromacy is one of the symptoms of diseases that occur when only one kind of light receptor in the human retina is functional at a particular level of illumination. It is one of the symptoms of either acquired or inherited disease as for example acquired achromatopsia, inherited autosomal recessive achromatopsia and recessive X-linked blue cone monochromacy. There are two basic types of monochromacy. \\"Animals with monochromatic vision may be either rod monochromats or cone monochromats. These monochromats contain photoreceptors which have a single spectral sensitivity curve.\\" *Rod monochromacy (RM), also called congenital complete achromatopsia or total color blindness, is a rare and extremely severe form of an autosomal recessively inherited retinal disorder resulting in severe visual handicap. People with RM have a reduced visual acuity, (usually about 0.1 or 20/200), have total color blindness, photo-aversion and nystagmus. The nystagmus and photo-aversion usually are present during the first months of life, and the prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 1 in 30,000 worldwide. Additionally, since patients with RM have no cone function and normal rod function, a rod monochromat cannot see any color but only shades of grey. *Cone monochromacy (CM) is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only having one functioning type of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues. In humans, who have three types of cones, the short (S, or blue) wavelength sensitive, middle (M, or green) wavelength sensitive and long (L, or red) wavelength sensitive cones have three differing forms of cone monochromacy, named according to the single functioning cone class: #Blue cone monochromacy (BCM), also known as S-cone monochromacy, is an X-linked cone disease. It is a rare congenital stationary cone dysfunction syndrome, affecting less than 1 in 100,000 individuals, and is characterized by the absence of L- and M-cone function. BCM results from mutations in a single red or red‚Äìgreen hybrid opsin gene, mutations in both the red and the green opsin genes or deletions within the adjacent LCR (locus control region) on the X chromosome. #Green cone monochromacy (GCM), also known as M-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and red cones are absent in the fovea. The prevalence of this type of monochromacy is less than 1 in 1 million. #Red cone monochromacy (RCM), also known as L-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and green cones are absent in the fovea. Like GCM, RCM is also present in less than 1 in 1 million people. Animal research studies have shown that the nocturnal wolf and ferret have lower densities of L-cone receptors. *Cone monochromacy, type II, if its existence were established, would be the case in which the retina contains no rods, and only a single type of cone. Such an animal would be unable to see at all at lower levels of illumination, and of course would be unable to distinguish hues. In practice, it is hard to produce an example of such a retina, at least as the normal condition for a species. Animals that are monochromats It used to be confidently claimed that most mammals other than primates were monochromats. In the last half- century, however, evidence of at least dichromatic color vision in a number of mammalian orders has accumulated. While typical mammals are dichromats, with S and L cones, two of the orders of marine mammals, the pinnipeds (which includes the seal, sea lion and walrus) and cetaceans (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals. The same is true of the owl monkeys, genus Aotus. A recent study using through PCR analysis of genes OPN1SW, OPN1LW, and PDE6C determined that all mammals in the order Xenarthra (representing sloths, anteaters and armadillos) developed rod monochromany through a stem ancestor. Researchers Leo Peichl, Guenther Behrmann and Ronald H. H. Kroeger report that of the many animal species studied, there are three carnivores that are cone monochromats: raccoon, crab- eating raccoon and kinkajou and a few rodents are cone monochromats because they are lacking the S-cone. These researchers also report that the animal's living environment also plays a significant role in the animals' eyesight. They use the example of water depth and the smaller amount of sunlight that is visible as one continues to go down. They explain it as follows, \\"Depending on the type of water, the wavelengths penetrating deepest may be short (clear, blue ocean water) or long (turbid, brownish coastal or estuarine water.)\\" Therefore, the variety of visible availability in some animals resulted in them losing their S-cone opsins. Monochromat capability According to Jay Neitz, a color vision researcher at the University of Washington, each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats can detect approximately 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors. Therefore, a monochromat would be able to distinguish about 100 colors.

The river is a tributary of the Parramatta River, winding through a bushland valley. It joins Parramatta River at Greenwich and Woolwich, where together they form an arm of Sydney Harbour, and serves a border along with Middle Harbour separating Sydney's North Shore. Ecology The Lane Cove River rises near Thornleigh and flows generally south for about . Its catchment area is approximately . The upper reaches are in a narrow, forested valley eroded into the North Shore Plateau. Fiddens Wharf was the site of early 19th century logging. The middle reaches are impounded by a weir just upstream of Fullers Bridge. Sections of the valley are forested and are protected within the Lane Cove National Park, an area of ,Guide to New South Wales National Parks, National Parks and Wildlife Service of NSW, 2002, p.34 formerly a State Recreation Area. The lower reaches of the Lane Cove River, downstream from the weir near Fullers Bridge, are tidal and merge into Sydney Harbour at Greenwich and Woolwich. There are significant areas of mangrove communities along the shores. The confluence of the river is with Scout Creek in Lane Cove National Park at Cheltenham. At North Epping, still within the confines of the national park, it is joined by Devlins Creek from the south and Terrys Creek near Macquarie Park. Southwest of Killara and Lindfield, the width of the river expands, continuing south through Lane Cove River National Park, towards the suburbs of Linley Point and Riverview, before finally reaching its mouth between Greenwich Point and Woolwich, where it merges with Parramatta River and soon after becomes part of Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour. Devlin Creek was named after the Devlin family, who lived in Willandra, a historical house in Ryde. Register of the National Estate The area surrounding the river, no more than wide, is called Lane Cove National Park, and is a site of ecological importance, listed on the Australian Register of the National Estate. It contains an endangered community of fungi, some species of which have still not been classified. A popular caravan park and campground known as Lane Cove River Tourist Park is located on the western side of the valley above the river. Great North Walk The Lane Cove River is the site of many old trails and tracks, some of which have survived from logging days. They are now used for recreational purposes. Some of them have been incorporated into the Great North Walk, a long distance walking trail from Sydney to Newcastle. This trail passes along the Lane Cove River between Boronia Avenue, Hunters Hill, and Thornleigh Oval, Thornleigh.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.5-30 On the east side of Thornleigh Oval, the trail makes use of Lorna Pass, a track built during the Depression of the 1930s to provide relief work. The pass was named after Lorna Brand, who raised money for the work. Another trail, the Lane Cove Valley Walk, stretches from Thornleigh to Lindfield. Fairyland From 1913 to the early 1970s, the Swan family operated a picnic area called Fairyland, which was located on the banks of the river, upstream from Epping Road. The area was originally a market garden, but the family turned it into a picnic area when they realized the commercial potential. Facilities were developed to the point where Fairyland had its own footbridge, BBQ fireplaces, boat swing, razzle dazzle ride, shelter, dance hall and wharf.A History of North Ryde 1850-1950 (published by North Ryde Public School) 1986, p.14 The area has now returned to nature and is contained within the Lane Cove National Park. The Great North Walk passes through it. Cultural items of significance Harry Smith was a businessman who owned land in what is now the Marsfield area. Smith created a picnic area in a section of his property he called Curzon Park, which bordered the Lane Cove River and consisted of eighty acres of bushland.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory 46th Edition, 1982, Map 64 The picnic area has long since returned to nature, but a set of stone steps can still be seen at the top of the escarpment above the river. It is almost certain that Smith had these steps built to provide access to the picnic area. This is supported by a news item from 1899, which states that a set of stone steps went down to the picnic area.Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate, 4 April 1899, p.8 Smith also had a quarry in the area, near the present location of Talavera Road, from which he obtained the stone to build his mansion, Curzon Hall. The latter was built circa 1899 and is located at the intersection of Balaclava and Agincourt Roads. The name Curzon came from his wife's name: Isabella Curzon Webb. The building was purchased by the Vincentian Fathers in 1922 and turned into a Catholic seminary. In 1983 it was acquired for business purposes and became a function centre. Curzon Hall is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register as a site of significance. Smith is remembered as a philanthropist who allowed the public to use the picnic area free of charge, and who built the public school in Marsfield. He died in 1913. The river is known for being the site of the mysterious deaths of Dr Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler on 1 January 1963. The cause of their deaths has never been established; but there is a strong theory that the two deaths may have been caused by accidental hydrogen sulphide poisoning, due to the build-up of the poisonous gas beneath the river bed that formed both naturally and by pollutants from nearby factories along the river.

Greenwich is located north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Lane Cove. The suburb occupies a peninsula on the northern side of Sydney Harbour, at the opening of the Lane Cove River. The suburb features harbour views, a few pockets of bushland, shops, restaurants, cafes and a harbour swimming pool with shark net. History The suburb's name is derived from its namesake Greenwich, by the banks of the River Thames in London. Parramatta River had been known as the 'Thames of the Antipodes' and other nearby suburbs were also named after Thames localities of Putney, Woolwich and Henley. left The Cammeraygal clan of the Kuringgai people were the first inhabitants of the Greenwich area, and lived along the foreshores of the harbour, hunting in the hinterland and trading with other clans. The first known occasion when a European went to the area was in 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Ball passed through the area while returning from a trip to the Middle Harbour area. Land grants began in 1794 and industries developed in the area during the 1830s.Lane Cove Council Website:retrieved 21 October 2009 Aboriginal people were still present in the 1820s, but disease and displacement had driven them out by the 1860s. Early land grants were made to Samuel Lightfoot, a convict, in 1794, and William Gore, public servant, in 1813. Gore built a road from his farm at Artarmon to Gore Cove, which was the beginning of Greenwich Road. In the 1830s George Green and his father Amaziah bought land in Greenwich, with access to the harbour, and along with others began a shipbuilding industry on the foreshore. When Green subdivided his land in 1840, the name 'Greenwich' was mentioned for the first time. thumb Greenwich House‚Äîa two-storey Georgian home made from sandstone blocks‚Äîwas built on the estate of George Green in 1836 and still stands on the corner of George and St Lawrence Streets.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 116 The house was eventually sold, by the mortgage holders, to Gother Kerr Mann in the early 1850s, and remained in that family until 1949. The eastern tip of Greenwich is called Manns Point, after Gother Kerr Mann (1809‚Äì1899). Mann was the first Chief Commissioner for Railways, the Superintendent of convicts at Cockatoo Island and the builder of Fitzroy Dock. By the early 1880s Greenwich Point already had a post office, general store, and school, with around 16 houses. Upper Greenwich took longer to develop, with most of the area still virgin bush. But with the improvement in north shore roads, and increasing subdivision in upper Greenwich, some grander houses were built near River Road, and new estates were subdivided as Greenwich became a commuter suburb. Between the 1880s and the 1940s a number of successful dairies operated in Greenwich, run by the Anderson, Hogan, Mather and Clarke families. The milk from Anderson's was delivered by boat along the Lane Cove River and to the residents of Cockatoo Island. Hogan's dairy at Chisholm Street had 300 cows by the time it closed in 1928. Clarke's dairy was on the site of the current golf course. Light industry was set up along the foreshores of Greenwich, including Shipbuilding, brickmaking, quarrying, and the Patent Asphaltum Company which refined bitumen and manufactured building materials. The Shell Transport and Trading Company opened a terminal at Gore Bay in 1901, importing and distributing petroleum products. It grew over time to include the sites of the Patent Asphaltum works, and several wharves, as well as the shale oil refining works of John Fell & Co. By the late 1930s, over 500 workers were employed at the Shell site. Today fuel products unloaded at Gore Bay are transferred by an underground pipe to the Clyde Refinery.About Us Viva Energy Australia Greenwich was the northern portal of the first tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel was dug by the New South Wales Government Railways to Birchgrove to provide a reliable way to get electricity from the Pyrmont Power Station to the tram network on the north shore. Cables had previously been laid on the floor of the harbour, but damaged by ships dragging their anchors. The tunnel was commenced in 1913 and excavated by hand, completed in 1924. Part of the tunnel is through the silt at the bottom of the river, so required constant pumping until it was allowed to flood in 1930 and abandoned from 1969. The tunnel was excavated almost entirely from the Greenwich side, as the residents on Long Nose Point at Balmain (now Birchgrove) successfully objected to the noise of the compressor powering pneumatic drills. There were both the tunnel portal and a vertical shaft nearer the water used for excavation. The tunnel passes between the floor of the harbour and the Balmain coal mine further below the harbour. The tunnel is excavated entirely through Hawkesbury sandstone which lies below the silt and sediment which form the floor of the harbour. At its lowest point, it is below sea level.  Heritage listings  Greenwich has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 95 River Road: Pallister, Greenwich * Greenwich Infants School * Sydney Harbour railway electricity tunnel Education Greenwich Public School is a local primary school with two separate campuses located 1.5 kilometres apart. It was opened in 1876 as a provisional school, after repeated petitions from residents, and became a public school in 1880, with a new building and site in Mitchell Street in 1881. In 1909 the school moved to the site of the current infants school in Greenwich Road, and the primary school moved to Kingslangley Road in 1950. The children of former Prime Minister John Howard, attended the school.Sydney Morning Herald, 2004 Transport Greenwich Point ferry wharf on the Parramatta River is served by Sydney Ferries Cockatoo Island ferry services between Circular Quay and Cockatoo Island.

Its relative, the slender-billed kite, is now again placed in Helicolestes, making the genus Rostrhamus monotypic. Usually, it is placed in the milvine kites, but the validity of that group is under investigation. Description Adult female Snail kites are long with a wingspan. They weigh from . There is very limited sexual dimorphism, with the female averaging only 3% larger than the male. They have long, broad, and rounded wings, which measure each. Its tail is long, at , with a white rump and undertail coverts. The dark, deeply hooked beak, measuring is an adaptation to its diet. The tarsus is relatively long as well, measuring . The adult male has dark blue-gray plumage with darker flight feathers. The legs and cere are red. The adult female has dark brown upperparts and heavily streaked pale underparts. She has a whitish face with darker areas behind and above the eye. The legs and cere are yellow or orange. The immature is similar to adult female, but the crown is streaked. It flies slowly with its head facing downwards, looking for its main food, the large apple snails. For this reason, it is considered a molluscivore. Taxonomy Lerner and Mindell (2005) found R. sociabilis sister to Geranospiza caerulescens, and that those two along with Ictinea plumbea were basal to both the buteogallus and buteo clades. They concluded that Rostrhamus belonged in Buteoninae (sensu stricto) and not in Milvinae, but noted that more investigation was needed. Distribution and ecology The snail kite breeds in tropical South America, the Caribbean, and central and southern Florida in the United States. It is resident all-year in most of its range, but the southernmost population migrates north in winter and the Caribbean birds disperse widely outside the breeding season. It nests in a bush or on the ground, laying 3‚Äì4 eggs. The snail kite is a locally endangered species in the Florida Everglades, with a population of less than 400 breeding pairs. Research has demonstrated that water-level control in the Everglades is depleting the population of apple snails. However, this species is not generally threatened over its extensive range. Adult male Everglades snail kite in Joe Overstreet Landing, Florida. In fact, it might be locally increasing in numbers, such as in Central America. In El Salvador, it was first recorded in 1996. Since then, it has been regularly sighted, including immature birds, suggesting a resident breeding population might already exist in that country. On the other hand, most records are outside the breeding season, more indicative of post-breeding dispersal. In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at Embalse Cerr√≥n Grande, Laguna El Jocotal, and especially Lago de G√ºija. Pomacea flagellata apple snails were propagated in El Salvador between 1982 and 1986 as food for fish stocks, and it seems that the widespread presence of high numbers of these snails has not gone unnoticed by the snail kite. This is a gregarious bird of freshwater wetlands, forming large winter roosts. Its diet consists almost exclusively of apple snails. Snail kites have been observed eating other prey items in Florida, including crayfish in the genus Procambarus and black crappie. It is believed that snail kites turn to these alternatives only when apple snails become scarce, such as during drought, but further study is needed. On 14 May 2007, a birdwatcher photographed a snail kite feeding at a red swamp crayfish farm in Clarendon County, South Carolina.

For instance, on one occasion Trurl creates an entity capable of extracting accurate information from the random motion of gas particles, which he calls a \\"Demon of the Second Kind\\". He describes the \\"Demon of the First Kind\\" as a Maxwell's demon. On another, the two constructors re-arrange stars near their home planet in order to advertise. The duo are best friends and rivals. When they are not busy constructing revolutionary mechanisms at home, they travel the universe, aiding those in need. As the characters are firmly established as good and righteous, they take no shame in accepting handsome rewards for their services. If rewards were promised and not delivered, the constructors may even severely punish those who deceived them. The world and its inhabitants The universe of The Cyberiad is pseudo-medieval. There are kingdoms, knights, princesses, and even dragons in abundance. Robots are usually anthropomorphic, to the point of being divided into sexes. Love and marriage are possible. Physical and mental disabilities, old age and death, particularly in case of accidents or murder, are also common, though mechanical language is used to describe them. Death is theoretically avoidable (by means of repair), and sometimes even reversible. In fact, the teacher of Trurl and Klapaucius, Master Cerebron, is deceased, but can still be reanimated at his tomb. The level of technology of the vast majority of inhabitants is pseudo-Medieval also, with swords, robotic steeds, and gallows widespread. With this co-exist space travel, extremely advanced technology made by the Constructors and futuristic weapons and devices used or mentioned on occasion. There even exists a civilization that has achieved the \\"HPLD\\" ‚Äì Highest Possible Level of Development. Romantic stories Some stories are basically self-conscious parodies of romantic novels about knights, with more profound issues of psychology and social dynamics under a cartoonish and swashbuckling facade. Three of them were published in an earlier collection, Fables for Robots. A typical example is the fairy tale O kr√≥lewiczu Ferrycym i kr√≥lewnie Krystalii (\\"Prince Ferrix and the Princess Crystal\\"). A princely (robotic) knight falls in love with a beautiful (robotic) princess. Unfortunately, the princess is somewhat eccentric, and is captivated by stories of an alien non-robotic, \\"paleface\\" civilization (the humans). She declares that she will only marry a \\"paleface\\". Therefore, the knight decides to masquerade as a paleface. He covers himself with mud, starting to resemble one, and then comes to woo her. Meanwhile, a real \\"paleface\\" captive arrives, given as a gift to the king. It immediately becomes obvious to the princess who is the \\"muddier\\" one, but the \\"paleface\\" turns out to be too squishy and overall disgusting. Not wanting to back down at the last minute, however, the princess declares a joust between the two suitors to select the worthier one. When the \\"paleface\\" charges at the robot, he splatters himself on the latter's metal chest, revealing the metallic body to all. The princess, beholding the beauty of the exposed robot (compared with the ugliness of the \\"paleface\\"), changes her mind. The knight and the princess live happily ever after. Stories involving technology and the Constructors Most of the stories involve Trurl and Klapaucius using their extraordinary technological abilities to help the inhabitants of the medieval planets, usually involving neutralizing tyrants. Trurl and Klapaucius come to a planet ruled by a king who loves hunting. He has already \\"conquered\\" all the most dangerous of predators, and now hires constructors (engineers) to make new, mighty robotic beasts for him to hunt. He has already executed all of the previous constructors who visited because they could not build beasts that would be challenging enough to hunt. When the two famous Constructors arrive, they are arrested and ordered to construct a worthy foe for the king within twelve days. The two face a dilemma: if they make something that the king will kill, they will be executed by the mad king. But if the king himself is killed, then they will be executed, for the next king will be pressured to show his respect for the previous. They solve the problem by building an animal that survives the hunt (involving both cyber-hounds and nuclear tipped missiles unleashed upon it, in the characteristic cartoonish manner) and takes the king hostage by, nothing less, turning into several police officers and presenting an order for his arrest. All the king's men fail to find and free the king (partially because in searching for the fake policemen one half of the real police force arrests the other half), and he is released only after the Constructors' numerous demands are met. On another occasion, Trurl and Klapaucius are captured by an interstellar \\"PHT\\" pirate. Trurl offers to build a machine capable of turning hydrogen into gold (something he can do manually, which he demonstrates by hand, mixing up protons and putting electrons around). However, the pirate turns out to have a PhD and cares not for the riches, but for knowledge (and in fact points out that gold becomes cheap if it is abundant). Trurl therefore makes a modified Maxwell's demon for him, an entity that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that is, coincidentally, encoded in their random perturbations. This way, all the information in the universe becomes easily available. The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely useless (although strictly factual) he is buried under the endless rolls of tape, ceasing to bother anyone. Stories involving the search for happiness and ideal society Lem was very interested in the issue of the nature of an ideal society: compare his Peace on Earth, The Futurological Congress and Observation on the Spot. The Highest Possible Level of Development civilization. A gravely injured hermit comes to Trurl's house and tells Trurl of Klapaucius's adventure: Klapaucius wanders across an old robot, who tells him that he has logically deduced the existence of a civilization that reached the highest possible level of development (hence \\"HPLD\\"). He has inferred the existence of such a civilization by figuring that if there are different stages of development, there will be one that is the highest. He was then faced with a problem of identifying that one; as he noted, everyone claimed that theirs was the HPLD. Upon much research and thought, he decided that the only way to find it is by looking for a \\"wonder\\", i.e. something that has no rational explanation. Eventually Klapaucius discovers one such wonder: a star in the shape of a cube, orbited by a planet also shaped like a cube with the huge letters HPLD written on it. He lands and meets its inhabitants: a group of about 100 individuals lying around doing nothing. When the HPLDs grow tired with Klapaucius's efforts to extract answers from them, they teleport him and his ship far into outer space, albeit after filling the ship with gifts. Seeing how he will not get anywhere this way, Klapaucius constructs a massive machine capable of simulating the entire universe, including a member of the HPLD civilization. Upon questioning the simulation, he is informed that over six million such interrogations took place in the past. The simulation also reveals that the civilization in question has long since achieved the HPLD, and thus has nothing else to strive for. When Klapaucius asks why the HPLD civilization does not continuously engage in helping other, less advanced civilizations, the simulation explains that their attempts to do so in the past have proven extremely counter- productive. For instance, having dropped some millions of wish-fulfilling devices on a planet, they saw it blow up in a matter of hours. Eventually, the HPLD representative provides Klapaucius with the formula for \\"Altruizine\\" ‚Äì a substance that allows individuals within a limited area to completely share all feelings and emotions, including both pain and joy. The idea behind Altruizine is that people who feel each other's pain as their own should treat each other as they would themselves. Altruizine. Klapaucius produces a large quantity of the substance and sends the above-mentioned hermit (who is eager to help others) in human guise to experiment on the population of a single planet. Some of the results include villagers feeling the birth pains of a cow, depressed people being violently attacked and driven off and a crowd storming the house of the newlyweds to vicariously participate in their unaccustomed sensations. Eventually, the hermit is identified for a robot (because he does not feel the humans' pain), is thoroughly beaten and tortured, then shot into outer space via a cannon. He then lands near Trurl's house, where the story began. Concluding his tale, the hermit assures Trurl that his thirst for altruism has vanished. Trurl and the construction of happy worlds. Trurl is not deterred by the cautionary tale of altruizine and decides to build a race of robots happy by design. His first attempt are a culture of robots who are not capable of being unhappy (e.g. they are happy if seriously beaten up). Klapaucius ridicules this. Next step is a collectivistic culture dedicated to common happiness. When Trurl and Klapaucius visit them, they are drafted by the Ministry of Felicity and made to smile, sing, and otherwise be happy, in fixed ranks (with other inhabitants). Trurl annihilates both failed cultures and tries to build a perfect society in a small box. The inhabitants of the box develop a religion saying that their box is the most perfect part of the universe and prepare to make a hole in it in order to bring everyone outside the Box into its perfection, by force if needed. Trurl disposes of them and decides that he needs more variety in his experiments and smaller scale for safety. He creates hundreds of miniature worlds on microscope slides (i.e. he has to observe them through a microscope). These microworlds progress rapidly, some dying out in revolutions and wars, and some developing as regular civilizations without any of them showing any intrinsic perfection or happiness. They do achieve inter-slide travel though, and many of these worlds are later destroyed by rats. Eventually, Trurl gets tired of all the work and builds a computer that will contain a programmatic clone of his mind that would do the research for him. Instead of building new worlds, the computer sets about expanding itself. When Trurl eventually forces it to stop building itself and start working, the clone-Trurl tells him that he has already created many sub-Trurl programs to do the work and tells him stories about their research (which Trurl later finds out is bogus). Trurl destroys the computer and temporarily stops looking for universal happiness.

She met his father in Washington, D.C., where she worked for a Democratic US Senator and became a civil rights activist. In the early 1950s in Toronto, Donna Hill worked as a human rights activist for the city's Labor Committee for Human Rights. She lobbied the Ontario government to enact anti- discrimination legislation. She also wrote about Black Canadian history; her A Black Man's Toronto, 1914-1980: The Reminiscences of Harry Gairey (1980) was published by the Multicultural History Society of Ontario. Daniel and Donna Hill co-founded The Ontario Black History Society with Wilson O. Brooks and other friends. Lawrence Hill was born as the second son, and grew up with his brother Dan and sister Karen in the predominantly white Toronto suburb of Don Mills. Dan Hill became a singer-songwriter and writer, and their sister, the late Karen Hill (1958-2014), was also a writer. Her novel, short stories, poems and an essay are still to be published. Hill's paternal grandfather and great grandfather were university-educated, ordained ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.http://www.humanities.utoronto.ca/event_details/id=571 It was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1816 as the first independent black denomination in the United States.

Warrawee is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Warrawee is located 15 kilometres north-west of the Sydney Central Business District in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007, Map 222 Warrawee is predominantly a small residential suburb with few commercial entities. Notably, its railway station provides no commercial activity which is uncommon in the Sydney train network. This should not be confused with Wirawee, the fictional small country town in the Tomorrow series of books for young people by John Marsden and the film derived from the first book, Tomorrow when the war began. History Warrawee is believed to have come from an Aboriginal word meaning rest a while, stop here or to stand.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia The suburb is rich in architectural history, with a number of houses designed by prominent architects. The earliest significant homes were Pibrac (1888), Cheddington (1890) and Wirepe (1893), all very fine houses. In 1888, the public servant and patron of exploration Frederick Ecclestone du Faur built his house Pibrac in Pibrac Avenue. The house was designed by John Horbury Hunt, a Canadian architect who settled in Australia and favoured the Arts and Crafts style, as well as the North American Shingle style, which he introduced to Australia. Later alterations were carried out by B.J. Waterhouse. The house is composed predominantly of timber, with extensive use of timber shingles, on a sandstone base. It is considered a good example of Hunt's work and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/33 Cheddington, the oldest home in established Hastings Road, is also attributed to Horbury Hunt, of brick and slate, with characteristic shingling. Wirepe, designed by M.B. Halligan for architect Walter Traill, used deep verandahs and high ceilings to elicit a homestead atmosphere, with fine corbelled chimneys and cedar shingles. The brickwork is of Colonial Bond design, and the house sits at the heart of the Ku-ring-gai heritage precinct on Hastings Road. Upton Grey (now Kooyong) was built in 1894 to a John Sulman design; its English features are a local landmark. Across the century it has served as a government social services home, a CSIRO field station, and a boarding house for Knox Grammar School. It is now in private hands and retains features replicated at Sulman's important Ingleholme. \\"Exley House\\" at Finlay Road Warrawee, was designed by Harry Seidler in 1957 for Cecil Exley ‚Äî an engineer with the Sydney Water Board ‚Äî and his wife. The three bedrooms, two bathroom home is the only red-brick single storey dwelling that Harry Seidler ever designed and the only one still in its original condition. As all North Shore suburbs with aboriginal names, Warrawee was the name of a railway station which became attached to the surrounding suburb. Warrawee had developed in the 1900s as an exclusive residential district with no shops, offices, post office, public school, churches or through roads.Paul Davis, November 2010, Kuring-Gai Potential Heritage Conservation Areas North Review \\"HCA 23 ‚Äì Warrawee\\" retrieved 16 April 2012.Knox Grammar was founded at Earlston, a Warrawee property across the railway line, in 1923, senior school 1924. All the blocks were kept to between one and four acres and the form of houses tightly controlled. See especially p. 27. Joseph Beresford Grant used his money to guarantee the exclusiveness of the development. Transport The Pacific Highway is the main arterial road. Warrawee railway station is on the North Shore & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. The railway station built in 1900 was the last one built on the North Shore Line before it was extended to North Sydney. Local residents had to fight the railway commissioners for a railway station, that is only one kilometre from Wahroonga. At the , 27% of employed people travelled to work on public transport compared to 10% average for all of Australia, while 51% travelled by car (either as driver or as passenger) compared to 66% nationally.  Demographics  At the , the suburb of Warrawee recorded a population of 2,995 people. Of these: *Age distribution: The median age of Warrawee residents was 41 years. Children aged under 15 years made up 18.6% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 15.5% of the population. *Ethnic diversity: More than half (60.9%) of residents were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were England 7%, China 5.6%, South Africa 2.9%, Korea 2.6% and India 2.2%. The most common ancestries in Warrawee were English 27.8%, Australian 19.8%, Chinese 8.9%, Scottish 8.1% and Irish 7.8%. *Finances: The median weekly household income was $3,085, more than double the national median of $1,438.

The North Shore Line extends from Sydney Central station through the western limb of the City Circle, across the Sydney Harbour Bridge and through the North Shore area to Hornsby where it joins the Main North Line. Most services on the line are part of the T1 North Shore & Western Line, with some services to Wyong during peak hours. History Aerial view of construction of the northern approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The original railway alignment and construction work on the realignment for extension across the bridge can both be seen. The North Shore Line was opened on 1 January 1890 as a single track between Hornsby and St Leonards. The line was extended to the Sydney Harbour foreshore at Milsons Point on 1 May 1893. Transport between this original Milsons Point station and central Sydney was by ferry boat. Most of the North Shore line was duplicated between 1900 and 1909. In 1927 the line was converted to electric operation using a 1500 volt DC, overhead supply. The construction works for the Sydney Harbour Bridge necessitated truncation of the southern terminus from Milsons Point to Lavender Bay. When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened on 19 March 1932 a new Milsons Point station (on the bridge approach) came into operation and the North Shore Line was extended through it and over the Sydney Harbour Bridge to link with the underground lines of central Sydney. The result is that the two ends of the North Shore Line link to the Sydney railway system at Central and Hornsby. After 1932 the original Lavender Bay station became a storage depot for electric trains, and the line connecting Lavender Bay to the North Shore line was reduced to single track. This line joins the current North Shore line at Waverton station. In 2009, a second connection to the Main Northern line was added with the opening to the Epping to Chatswood railway line. This connecting line was removed and incorporated into the Sydney Metro in 2019. The North Shore Line is now a major commuter artery between the North Shore and central Sydney. In early years, Old Milsons Point, Bay Road, St Leonards, Chatswood, Lindfield, Gordon, Pymble, Turramurra, Wahroonga and Hornsby stations had goods yards. All but St Leonards, Chatswood and Hornsby yards had disappeared by mid-twentieth century, and the latter three did not survive into the late twentieth century.  Route  The North Shore line officially starts at Central, with a junction with the Main Suburban line south of the Flying Junctions. The line runs through Central, then goes underground alongside the City Circle, with stations at Town Hall and Wynyard. There is a crossover north of Wynyard allowing southbound trains to terminate when there is trackwork in the City Circle. After Wynyard, the line emerges onto the western side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Milsons Point station. The line continues for a short distance to North Sydney station, which has 4 platforms. The outer two tracks are for through services, while the inner two tracks are loop lines for terminating trains. After North Sydney, the line snakes its way through Sydney's lower North Shore, passing Waverton, Wollstonecraft, St Leonards and Artamon stations. At Waverton is the small junction with the Lavender Bay line, providing access to Lavender Bay/North Sydney Sidings. This section of line also has the sharpest curve on Sydney's suburban network, at Wollstonecraft of . At Chatswood, there are 4 platforms, with the inner two used by Sydney Metro Northwest and formerly to enter the Epping to Chatswood rail link. The line continues up the North Shore region, with stations at Roseville, Lindfield, Killara, Gordon, Pymble, Turramurra, Warrawee, Wahroonga and Waitara. Lindfield has an additional bay platform in the centre, used to terminate trains from the south. A similar arrangement exists at Gordon, where the centre platform is connected to a loop line that can terminate trains in both directions. After Waitara, the line proceeds to Hornsby, where there is a junction with the Main Northern Line and Hornsby Maintenance Centre.

Lane Cove is nine kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Lane Cove Council. Lane Cove West and Lane Cove North are separate suburbs. Lane Cove occupies a peninsula on the northern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), at the opening of the Lane Cove River. The regional administrative and shopping hub of Chatswood is located 3 kilometres away, along with Macquarie Park 4 kilometres away.  History  Suburban area of Lane Cove There are a number of possibilities of the origin of the name 'Lane Cove'. The first written use of the name was by Lieutenant William Bradley after he had just sailed along the river in 1788. Some have argued that it was named after Lieutenant Michael Lane, a respected cartographer, who had once worked with Captain Cook. Others say that it was in honour of John Lane, who was the son of the London Lord Mayor at the time as well as a good friend of the first Governor, Arthur Phillip. In any case, the name stuck, and by the 1800s was being used to refer to all the land north of the river. =Aboriginal culture= Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet, the area in which Lane Cove is situated was inhabited by the Cam-mer-ray-gal Group of the Ku-ring-gai Aboriginal Tribe. The group, which inhabited the north shore of Port Jackson, was one of the largest in the Sydney area. =European settlement= Lieutenant Ralph Clark was the first European to land, a short distance from the entrance to the Lane Cove River on 14 February 1790. There were land grants in 1794 to some privates and non-commissioned officers in the New South Wales Corps, although few of these grants were actually settled as the steep, timbered land was not particularly habitable. However, Lane Cove was an excellent source for timber and other commodities that the settlers required. During the 19th century, farms and dairies were also established. There were also many industrial and manufacturing factories constructed around Greenwich. A detailed history of the early years of Lane Cove is found in Ball. John and Pam, Revisiting the early history of Lane Cove, 2010, Oughtershaw Press, . 253 pages. Most of the residential growth in the area however occurred after World War II when returning soldiers were granted blocks of land around Lane Cove. The land value, which was relatively cheap during this time, surged during the 1980s and 1990s when the water views, large suburban blocks, ease of transport and quiet streets became popular.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.146 , page 146 In 2005, Lane Cove briefly caught the attention of the world's press when part of an apartment block (which is now classified as being in the new suburb of North Lane Cove) collapsed into an excavation for the Lane Cove Tunnel and a pet bird in the evacuated block was rescued by a robot.; Lane Cove North was split off to become a separate suburb on 20 January 2006. =Former tram line= The tram service to Lane Cove opened as an electric line from Crows Nest in February 1900, with trams connecting with other electric services at Ridge St. It was initially opened as far as Gore Hill and extended to Lane Cove in March, 1909. Some through services operated to and from Milsons Point.D Keenan: The North Sydney lines of the Sydney tramway system. Transit Press November 1987 In September 1909, a new line was opened from McMahons Point to Victoria Cross, North Sydney and a new direct route was opened via what is now the Pacific Highway from Victoria Cross to Crows Nest. Services to Lane Cove and Chatswood were altered to operate to and from McMahons Point via the new direct route to Crows Nest, in conjunction with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. In March, 1932 the Sydney Harbour Bridge with its associated railway and tramway tracks was opened and services from Lane Cove to the CBD were diverted to operate to and from Wynyard Station via the Sydney Harbour Bridge route. Trams entered Wynyard station via a tunnel entrance at the south-eastern pylon of the bridge. From Lane Cove a cross regional service to Balmoral was also available. Upon departure from the Lane Cove terminus opposite the council chambers, trams travelled north on Longueville Road turning right onto the Pacific Highway. At Crows Nest, separate lines branched left onto Falcon Street, travelling through Cammeray, Neutral Bay, Cremorne Junction and Mosman before Joining Military Road. The line then split into two separate lines at the intersection of Middle Head Road and Bradleys Head Road. Turning left into Gordon Street off Middle Head Road, the line then entered on to its own off road reservation, crossing several small residential streets as it wound its way down to Henry Plunkett Reserve, entering The Esplanade near the corner of Botanic Road and terminating near Hunters Parade.Gregory's Street Directory 1955, Map 58, 59, 75  Heritage listings  Lane Cove has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 334 Burns Bay Road: Carisbrook, Lane Cove  Commercial area  Lane Cove Town Hall Although Lane Cove contains residential, it contains some commercial and industrial. Lane Cove has a shopping centre that includes a pedestrian plaza at the eastern end of Burns Bay Road, where it meets Longueville Road. There is a Coles supermarket, a Woolworths supermarket, a pub and a number of small specialty stores in this area, as well as a large number of restaurants and cafes. At the end of Longueville Road is the Lane Cove Businessman's Club which is the only local Club in the Area. Several large businesses are located in Lane Cove including the Australian headquarters of statistical software company SAS, the recording house for Warner Bros., Festival Mushroom Records, as well as Bluescope Steels Marketing branch in Lane Cove West. = Lane Cove Library = The interior of Lane Cove Library in 2020 Lane Cove Library is located at Library Walk, Lane Cove. The library received a major update with an extension/refurbishment which increased Library space from 1,203 sq m to 3,301 sq m - exceeding state benchmarks. =Greenwich Library= A small Branch Library is located at Greenwich. =Lane Cove Aquatic Centre= Lane Cove Aquatic Centre contains a 50-metre swimming pool, a 25-metre swimming pool, a shallow pool for toddlers and young children and a well equipped gym. There are also water springs, a sauna, spa and a kiosk.  Transport  The Gore Hill Freeway, which brings traffic from the city, the airport and southern suburbs connects to two major roads at Lane Cove - the Pacific Highway which travels north and Epping Road which goes north-west. The traffic problems at these intersections led to the construction of the Lane Cove Tunnel, which takes vehicles straight from the Gore Hill Expressway to the M2. Cars can now travel from the Baulkham Hills Shire to the airport without having to pass a single set of traffic lights (although there are tolls to pay in each direction). Since the opening of the Lane Cove Tunnel, two lanes of Epping Road between Mowbray Road and Lane Cove have been removed, with the left lane in each direction becoming a Bus Lane, reducing Epping Road in some sections to one lane in each direction for general traffic and increasing congestion. Getting in and out of Lane Cove can take 20 - 30 minutes in a car in peak hour. Lane Cove was the terminus of one of Sydney's northern tram lines, which closed in the late 1950s. Trams operated to Wynyard in the city and Balmoral via Crows Nest. The current 254 bus route largely follows the city route from Longueville Road to Wynyard via Crows Nest and North Sydney. The now-defunct 140 bus route From Manly to Epping follows a large section of the old Balmoral route. A new major bus interchange constructed at the intersection of Epping Road and Longueville Road, as part of the Lane Cove tunnel works, opened in March 2008 with approximately 25 separate bus routes (including school routes) operating from here. This provides connections to north-west Sydney with services to Castle Hill and Rouse Hill operated by HillsBus, and publicly operated services to Chatswood, Epping, North Sydney, Macquarie Park/Centre, Gladesville and Drummoyne. City (QVB) Express services are extremely busy during morning peak. A cyclepath has been constructed along the southern edge of Epping Road from the Pacific Highway to the Lane Cove River. This cyclepath links to the Gore Hill Freeway Cyclepath. Connecting cyclepaths allow cyclists to journey to Chatswood, North Sydney, Willoughby and the Macquarie Park area. A ferry service that travels someway down the Lane Cove River, stops at Longueville Wharf and Greenwich Wharf. The closest train stations are about 3 kilometres away at Chatswood and Artarmon. It is not surprising that according to the 2001 census, only 4.1% of the population travelled to work by train alone. Other ways to travel include the train and bus (1.7%), walking or cycling (5.9%), the bus only (14.3%), and car (71.0%). Education, culture and religion Schools in Lane Cove are: * Currambena School - an independent primary and preschool. * Lane Cove Public School - a primary school, established in 1876, that educates around 800 students. * St Michael's School - a Catholic primary school, originally run by the Sisters of Mercy, who began teaching there in 1922. * Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview - a Jesuit high school for boys, founded in 1880. Cultural groups and services include the Lane Cove Youth Orchestra, Lane Cove Concert Band, Lane Cove Art Society, Lane Cove Dance Academy, Lane Cove Music and Cultural Centre, Lane Cove Historical Society, Lane Cove Theatre Company and Lane Cove Bushland and Conservation Society. Annual festivals are the Lane Cove Autumn Harmony Festival and the Cameraygal Festival. Places of worship in Lane Cove are: * St Michael's Catholic Church * St Andrew's Anglican Church * Lane Cove Uniting Church * The Christian City Church meets each Sunday at Lane Cove Public School. * Shinnyo- en Buddhist Temple Sports The Lane Cove Aquatic Leisure Centre provides excellent facilities and is situated adjacent to Pottery Green Oval, which is used for cricket in summer and soccer and baseball in winter. The Lane Cove Cricket Club and Lane Cove Rugby Club have their homeground at Tantallon Oval.http://www.covies.com/ The cricket club was established in 1893 and the Rugby Club in 1949. The Longueville Bowling Club, now known as the Longueville Sporting Club, has a lawn bowls green and is located close to the Lane Cove Country Club 9 hole golf course. Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview is an active participant in the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales, and has fielded cricket and rugby sides in this sporting competition for over a century. It also hosts the historic Riverview Gold Cup Regatta on the Lane Cove River. The rowing race day began in 1882. Lane Cove also has Junior sporting clubs. * Lane Cove Junior Rugby Union Club - U-5 to U-16 * Lane Cove Junior Rugby Club - Minis, U-10 to U-16 * Lane Cove Tigers Junior Rugby League Club * Lane Cove Cats AFL Club - Auskick, U-9 to U-11 * Lane Cove Football Club - U-6 to U-18 * Lane Cove Cricket Club - U=9 to Seniors Parks Woodford Bay, Lane Cove River Around 16% of the area is devoted to public recreational areas including Burns Bay Park, Tambourine Bay Park, Pottery Green, Blackman Park and Tantallon Oval. As well as this there is a large amount of bushland surrounding the river's edge especially near Riverview and Lane Cove West. Lane Cove also has many small creeks and rivers that flow through it and therefore has many expanses of bushland. The Lane Cove River is the largest river in the area. Lane Cove National Park is located close to the suburb. The Lane Cove Bushland Park is home to an endangered species of fungus, Hygrocybe lanecovensis, which is found nowhere else.NSW threatened species: Hygrocybe lanecovensis The species was discovered in the 1990s.

(born March 17, 1936) is a former American aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, Rear Admiral in the United States Navy and astronaut who flew on the Apollo 16, STS-4 and STS-51-C missions. Mattingly had been scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but three days prior to launch, he was held back and removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles (which he did not contract). He later flew as Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16 and made 64 lunar orbits,NASA Apollo 16 summary page making him one of 24 people to have flown to the Moon. Mattingly and his commander from Apollo 16, John Young, are the only people to have flown to the Moon and also a Space Shuttle orbital mission (Fred Haise, his former training crewmate from Apollo 13, did atmospheric flight testing of the Space Shuttle \\"Approach and Landing Tests\\"). During Apollo 16's return flight to Earth, Mattingly performed an extravehicular activity to retrieve film cassettes from the exterior of the spacecraft, the command and service module. It was the second \\"deep space\\" EVA in history, at great distance from any planetary body. As of , it remains one of only three such EVAs which have taken place, all during the Apollo program's J-missions. Early life and education Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II was born on March 17, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, to Thomas Kenneth Mattingly and Constance Mason () Mattingly. His father, who had been hired by Eastern Airlines soon after his son's birth, moved the family to Hialeah, Florida. Aviation became part of Mattingly's life from a very young age; he later recalled that his \\"earliest memories ... all had to do with airplanes.\\" Mattingly was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Miami Edison High School in 1954, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Auburn University in 1958. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity (Epsilon Alpha chapter). Retrieved February 19, 2012  Military career  He joined the U.S. Navy as an Ensign in 1958 and received his aviator wings in 1960. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron Thirty-five (VA-35) at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia and flew A-1H Skyraider aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier from 1960 to 1963. In July 1963, he served in Heavy Attack Squadron Eleven (VAH-11) at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, where he flew the A-3B Skywarrior aircraft for two years and deployed aboard . While based at Sanford, Mattingly's friend and fellow officer was assigned to a undertake aerial photo reconnaissance of a launch from Cape Canaveral and he convinced Mattingly to accompany him to on this mission and they ended up observing the launch of the Gemini 3 (carrying Mattingly's future Apollo 16 Commander John Young) from the air.https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm. After finishing his second cruise, Mattingly was frustrated in his attempt to join the US Navy Test pilot school at Patuxent River since the said cruise ended after the start of the class, however, he managed to obtain a place in the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Airforce Basehttps://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm where future astronauts Edgar Mitchell and Karol J. Bobko were his classmates and instructors included Charles Duke, his Apollo 16 crewmate and Henry Hartsfield who Mattingly would command on STS 4. He has logged 7,200 hours of flight time‚Äîwhich includes 5,000 hours in jet aircraft. NASA career Mattingly (center) as part of the original prime crew for Apollo 13 =Selection and training= On September 10, 1965, NASA began the selection process for the fifth astronaut group. From a pool of 351 applicants, NASA selected 159 candidates that met the basic qualifications that required that applicants must be United States citizens born on or after December 1, 1929, and no more than six feet tall. They were also required to have at least 1,000 hours of flight time in a jet aircraft. Mattingly had previously shown little interest and inclination to apply for the astronaut program, however, his views changed when at the Air Force Test pilot school and his class was offered the chance to apply for either NASA or the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory program. Mattingly and Mitchell chose the later snd were rejected. The deadline for applying for the NASA group had passed however one of their instructors was able to get NASA to accept their application regardlesshttps://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm. On the interview panel the astronaut office representatives were John Young and Michael Collins, at that time in training as prime crew for Gemini 10. Mattingly would later recollect that he was \\"perplexed\\" by Young. Collins asked Mattingly what he felt about the F-104, to which Mattingly replied that he thought it was a \\"fun aircraft\\" but without worth in combat, Collins appeared to dislike the answer and Mattingly felt he had blown his chance. However, after the conclusion of the selection process, Mattingly was called by Deke Slayton with an offer to become an astronaut.https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm At the time of his selection, had 2,582 hours of flight experience, including 1,036 hours in a jet aircraft. He also had a bachelor's degree in engineering or in the physical or biological sciences as required by the initial qualifications. From the 100 military personnel and 59 civilian candidates, NASA selected 19 astronauts to join the group. Mattingly, a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, was a student at the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, when NASA selected him as an astronaut in April 1966. =Apollo 8 and Apollo 11= Mattingly poses at the launch pad At first, Mattingly was part of the support crew for Apollo 8. Mattingly served as CAPCOM during Apollo 8's second television transmission and subsequent preparation for trans-Earth injection. He then trained parallel with Bill Anders for Apollo 11 as backup Command Module Pilot, because Anders was going to retire from NASA in August 1969, and in case of mission delay, Anders would be unavailable. =Apollo 13= Mattingly's first prime assignment was to be the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission. Three days prior to launch, he was removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles (which he never contracted) and was replaced by the backup CM pilot, Jack Swigert. As a result, he missed the dramatic in-flight explosion that crippled the spacecraft. However, Mattingly was involved in helping the crew solve the problem of power conservation during re-entry. =Apollo 16= Mattingly performs a deep-space EVA during Apollo 16 The swapout from Apollo 13 placed Mattingly on the crew that would fly Apollo 16 (April 16‚Äì27, 1972), the fifth crewed lunar landing mission. The crew included John W. Young (Commander), Mattingly (Command Module Pilot), and Charles M. Duke Jr. (Lunar Module Pilot). The mission assigned to Apollo 16 was to collect samples from the lunar highlands near the crater Descartes. While in lunar orbit the scientific instruments aboard the Command/Service Module Casper extended the photographic and geochemical mapping of a belt around the lunar equator. Twenty-six separate scientific experiments were conducted both in lunar orbit and during cislunar coast. Major emphasis was placed on using man as an orbital observer, capitalizing on the human eye's unique capabilities and man's inherent curiosity. During the return leg of the mission, Mattingly carried out an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film and data packages from the science bay on the side of the service module. Although the mission of Apollo 16 was terminated one day early, due to concern over several spacecraft malfunctions, all major objectives were accomplished through the ceaseless efforts of the mission support team and were made possible by the most rigorous preflight planning yet associated with an Apollo mission. =Space Shuttle flights= Following his return to Earth, Mattingly served in astronaut managerial positions in the Space Shuttle development program. Mattingly (foreground) with Henry Hartsfield salutes President Ronald Reagan, next to First Lady Nancy Reagan, after the STS-4 landing on July 4, 1982 \\"President Ronald Reagan chats with NASA astronauts Henry Hartsfield and Thomas Mattingly on the runway as first lady Nancy Reagan scans the nose of Space Shuttle Columbia following its Independence Day landing at Edwards Air Force Base on July 4, 1982.\\" Mattingly was named to command STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 27, 1982, with Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., as the pilot. This 7-day mission was designed to further verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; perform continued studies of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the orbiter subsystems; and conduct a survey of orbiter-induced contamination on the orbiter payload bay. Additionally, the crew operated several scientific experiments located in the orbiter's cabin and in the payload bay. These experiments included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System experiment designed to investigate the separation of biological materials in a fluid according to their surface electrical charge. This experiment was a pathfinder for the first commercial venture to capitalize on the unique characteristics of space. The crew is also credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled them to activate the first operational \\"Getaway Special\\" (composed of nine experiments that ranged from algae and duckweed growth in space to fruit fly and brine shrimp genetic studies). STS-4 completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on July 4, 1982. Mattingly and Hartsfield were greeted by President Ronald Reagan after the landing; Reagan recognized the pair, both graduates of Auburn University, as \\"you two sons of Auburn\\" in his welcoming speech. STS-51-C, the first Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 24, 1985. The crew included Ken Mattingly (spacecraft commander), Loren Shriver (pilot), James Buchli and Ellison Onizuka (Mission Specialists), and Gary Payton (DOD Payload Specialist). STS-51-C performed its DOD mission which included deployment of a modified Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) vehicle from the Space Shuttle Discovery. Landing occurred on January 27, 1985. Post-NASA career In 1985, Mattingly retired from NASA and retired from the Navy in 1986 with the two-star rank of Rear admiral (upper half), and entered the private sector. He worked as a Director in Grumman's Space Station Support Division. He then headed the Atlas booster program for General Dynamics in San Diego, California. At Lockheed Martin he was Vice President in charge of the X-33 development program. He is currently working at Systems Planning and Analysis in Virginia. Mattingly is a member of many organizations. He is an associate fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; fellow, American Astronautical Society; and member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and the U.S. Naval Institute. Awards and honors Mattingly is a recipient of numerous awards. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medals (2); Johnson Space Center Certificate of Commendation (1970); JSC Group Achievement Award (1972); Navy Distinguished Service Medal; Navy Astronaut Wings; SETP Ivan C. Kincheloe Award (1972); Delta Tau Delta Achievement Award (1972); Auburn Alumni Engineers Council Outstanding Achievement Award (1972); AAS Flight Achievement Award for 1972; AIAA Haley Astronautics Award for 1973; F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale awarded him the V. M. Komarov Diploma in 1973; Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal (1982). Mattingly was inducted with a group of Apollo astronauts into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. Personal life In 1970, he married Elizabeth Dailey. They have one child. In media Mattingly was portrayed in the 1995 movie Apollo 13 by fellow Chicagoan Gary Sinise. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon by ≈Ωeljko Ivanek.

It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae. The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century.

He also developed a method for the analysis of nitrogen in compounds.  Biography  Dumas was born in Al√®s (Gard), and became an apprentice to an apothecary in his native town. In 1816, he moved to Geneva, where he attended lectures by M. A. Pictet in physics, C. G. de la Rive in chemistry, and A. P. de Candolle in botany, and before he had reached his majority, he was engaged with Pierre Pr√©vost in original work on problems of physiological chemistry and even of embryology. In 1822, he moved to Paris, acting on the advice of Alexander von Humboldt, where he became professor of chemistry, initially at the Lyceum, later (1835) at the √âcole polytechnique. He was one of the founders of the √âcole centrale des arts et manufactures (later named √âcole centrale Paris) in 1829. In 1832 Dumas became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. From 1868 until his death in 1884 he would serve the academy as the permanent secretary for its department of Physical Sciences. In 1838, Dumas was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The same year he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands and, when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member. Dumas was president of Soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale from 1845 to 1864. After 1848, he exchanged much of his scientific work for ministerial posts under Napol√©on III. He became a member of the National Legislative Assembly. He acted as minister of agriculture and commerce for a few months in 1850‚Äì1851, and subsequently became a senator, president of the municipal council of Paris, and master of the French mint, but his official career came to a sudden end with the fall of the Second Empire. Jean-Baptiste Dumas Dumas was a devout Catholic who would often defend Christian views against critics. Dumas died at Cannes in 1884, and is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, in a large tomb near the back wall. His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower.  Scientific work  Grave of Dumas (Paris) Dumas was one of the first to criticise the electro-chemical doctrines of J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, which, at the time his work began, were widely accepted as the true theory of the constitution of compound bodies, and opposed a unitary view to the dualistic conception of the Swedish chemist. In a paper on the atomic theory, published in 1826, he anticipated to a remarkable extent some ideas which are frequently supposed to belong to a later period; and the continuation of these studies led him to the ideas about substitution (metalepsis) which were developed about 1839 into the theory (Older Style Theory) that in organic chemistry there are certain types which remain unchanged even when their hydrogen is replaced by an equivalent quantity of a halide element. The classification of organic compounds into homologous series was advanced as one consequence of his researches into the acids generated by the oxidation of the alcohols. Dumas also showed that kidneys remove urea from the blood. Vapour densities and atomic masses Dumas perfected the method of measuring vapor densities which was also important in determining atomic weights (see below). A known amount of the substance being analyzed was put into a previously weighed glass bulb, which was then sealed and heated in water to vaporize the substance. The pressure was recorded with a barometer, and the bulb is allowed to cool to determine the mass of the vapor. The universal gas law was then used to determine the moles of gas within the bulb. In an 1826 paper, he described his method for ascertaining vapour densities, and the redeterminations which he undertook by its aid of the atomic weights of carbon and oxygen proved the forerunners of a long series which included some thirty of the elements, the results being mostly published in 1858‚Äì1860. He showed \\"in all elastic fluids observed under the same conditions, the molecules are placed at equal distances\\". He also determined the atomic weight of titanium, one of the rare earth elements. Dumas established new values for the atomic mass of thirty elements, setting the value for hydrogen to 1. Determination of nitrogen In 1833, Dumas developed a method for estimating the amount of nitrogen in an organic compound, founding modern analysis methods. He made important revisions to the existing combustion methods with a sophisticated pneumatic trough. These revisions were the flushing of the combustion tube with carbon dioxide and the addition of potassium hydroxide in the pneumatic trough. Flushing with carbon dioxide eliminated the nitrogen present in the air that previously occupied the combustion tube, eliminating the need for correction due to nitrogen in the air. The potassium hydroxide dissolved the passing carbon dioxide gas, which left nitrogen as the only gas in the collection tube. Theory of substitution and theory of chemical types At the Tuileries palace in Paris, guests of a soiree began reacting adversely to a gas suddenly emitted by the candles. Alexandre Brongniart asked his son-in- law, Dumas, to investigate. Dumas found that the coughing and dangerous fumes were caused by chlorine present in the candle wax. Chlorine had been used to whiten the candles, and Dumas concluded that it must have combined during the candle-making process. This led Dumas to investigate the behavior of chlorine substitution in other chemical compounds. One of the most important research projects of Dumas was that on the action of chlorine on acetic acid to form trichloroacetic acid ‚Äì a derivative of essentially the same character as the acetic acid itself. Dumas extended this to a theory (sometimes considered a law) which states that in an organic compound, a hydrogen atom may be substituted for any halogen. In his published paper on the subject, Dumas introduces his theory of types. Since the trichloracetic acid retained similar properties to acetic acid, Dumas reasoned that there were certain chemical structures that remained comparatively unchanged even if one atom were changed within them. The basis of this theory rests in the natural history of organism classification, which Dumas learned under the botanist de Candolle. This new theory challenged Berzelius's previous theory of electrochemical dualism and was also a competitor of radical theory. Family He married Herminie Brongniart, daughter of Alexandre Brongniart, in 1826.

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line and T9 Northern line services. Situated at St Johns Avenue, Gordon in the Ku-ring-gai Council local government area of New South Wales, Australia, the station was designed and built by the New South Wales Department of Railways in 1909. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History In 1887, tenders were called for construction of a branch line extending south from Hornsby to the North Shore. The section between Hornsby and St. Leonards was opened on 1 January 1890. Stations provided at the opening of the line included Chatswood and St Leonards. A single line was constructed at the time. The line between St Leonards and Milson's Point (the terminus at the edge of the harbour) was completed 1 May 1893. Gordon Railway Station was opened on 1 January 1890. In 1909 the single line was duplicated between Hornsby and St. Leonard's. At Gordon, during the duplication the original single platform and station building were replaced by a new island platform with a standard brick island- platform style station building. The island platform served the Up North Shore line and the Down North Shore line. A third platform was built at Gordon (the Local Platform) adjacent to the Up line. This platform allowed for termination of local trains at Gordon. At the time of duplication, an overhead footbridge and booking office was built which allowed local residents to cross from one side of Gordon to the other and allowed access to the platforms via sets of steps. A goods siding (adjacent to the Down line), crossovers and a signal box on the platform (part of the station building) completed the track arrangement. Originally southbound services used Platform 1 with Platform 2 a terminal road with a buffer stop at the northern end. In the early 1990s, the station was reconfigured with Platform 2 becoming the main southbound platform and Platform 1 the terminal road. Since the 1990s, a number of car parks have been built. In 2014, the bus stop on the station's western side was demolished to make way for a three-storey carpark and bus interchange.Gordon Commuter Carparks & Interchange Transport for NSW The new interchange opened in early June 2015. Platforms and services  Description  =Buildings and structures= The buildings comprise a station building, including a signal box, and platforms 2/3, completed ; an overhead booking office, completed ; and station building and platform 1, completed in 1993. Other structures include a footbridge, completed in 1909; platforms, completed in 1909; and modern steel shelters. =Context= Gordon Railway Station is located east of the Pacific Highway at Gordon. The station includes three platforms; an early 20th century overhead walkway and booking office with modern lift towers on the northern side; an early 20th century station building on an island platform; a reconstructed late 19th century timber waiting room; and an easement approximately 10m wide on either side of the railway tracks, which has been landscaped. The station is accessed via modern stairs and disabled ramp from either side of the station. There is a commercial strip on the western side of the Pacific Highway immediately across the road from the station. =Station building ()= Exterior: Located on the island platform (Platform 2/3) the station building is a good representative example of the standard railway design A8-A10 station buildings along the Northern line. Walls are red face brick, tuck pointed with moulded rendered string course, architraves and window sills. The gabled roof is modern corrugated steel, and the ends are timber boarded. The lower pitched awnings over the platform are supported on cast iron awning brackets springing from moulded rendered corbels. One face brick chimney with rendered top is sited along the ridge line. At the northern end of the building is located a brick signal box with encircling sliding 6-paned windows on three sides under the main roof line. The exterior of the station is largely in original condition, with no additional openings or infilled elements. Interior: The interior of the Platform 2/3 station building contains a high degree of original fabric and layout. Original internal details include mini-orb ceiling, ceiling roses, plastered wall finishes with moulded dado, and door and window joinery including 16-paned coloured glass sashes. The floor has been replaced with concrete, and modern fluorescent lighting installed. The interior of the signal box is painted brick to window sill height and timber boarded above the windows, with a mini orb ceiling and timber floor. Fittings include the 28 lever frame, key box, 1927 Indicator board, 1969 indicator board, original timber desk and bells. =Overhead booking office= Exterior: The timber framed and weatherboard clad booking office was constructed in 1910 and located on the overhead platform. It has a gabled roof of modern corrugated iron steel with finials. The roof overhang and projecting gable on the southern side provides a sheltered area for ticket purchasing, and features timber boarded ceiling and rose. Two modern ticket windows have been inserted into original openings with decorative timber architraves remaining. Other modern ticket machines have been recessed into the building in new openings with profiled timber architraves. Two new steel and glass lifts are located on the north side of the building and overbridge. New access structures to these lifts have been constructed in a similar style and material to the original booking office, and feature coloured glass panels. The lift access structure on the eastern side includes two small commercial tenancies, only one of which is presently occupied. Interior: Internally the original layout of the building appears to have been largely altered. Timber panelled wall linings appear original, although the battened plaster ceiling is not. Air- conditioning ducts and fluorescent lights are modern. Doors are timber panelled and windows are 4 or 6-paned sash, which all appear to be original. =Station building (1993)= A small timber framed structure reconstructed in 1993 based on the design of the original 1890 waiting room. The structure is clad externally with timber weatherboards and has a skillion roof of corrugated steel. The structure is open with exposed framing, concrete floor and timber bench. =Footbridge= Dating from 1909 the footbridge has a steel haunched beam construction supported on steel trestles. The two bay structure spans two tracks on the eastern side and one track on the western side of the rail corridor. Markings of imported British steel manufacturers are visible, both Lanarkshire, and Dorman Long & Co., Middlesbrough. The concourse has a concrete deck and modern steel balustrades. Modern concrete steps on steel supports provide access to the island platform. Similar steps and disabled ramp provide access to the streets on either side of the station. =Platforms= The island platform (Platform 2/3) at Gordon was built in 1909 as part of the line duplication for the Northern line, and has brick faces and an asphalt platform surface. The overhead booking office and footbridge are located approximately at the halfway point of the platform, with the station building located at the southern end. Platform 1 also has brick faces and an asphalt surface and is likely to date from the same period. =Modern steel structures= As part of the upgrading of the station in which lifts were installed, steel framed shelters were installed at the northern end of both platforms. =Landscape= Both the eastern and western lengths of the rail corridor are landscaped with several mature trees and shrubs including poplars, jasmine, jacaranda, palms, agapanthus, camellias and lawned areas. =Moveable items= *1914‚Äì1918 Honour Roll (overhead platform) *1927 and 1969 timber indicator boards still in use (overhead platform) *Cast iron drinking fountain (Platform 2/3) = Condition = As at 26 October 2010, the overhead Booking Office was in good condition. Also in good condition were the two station buildings (Platform 2/3) and (Platform 1), the footbridge, the platforms, and the landscape. The modern steel shelters were assessed as being in very good condition. The archaeological potential is considered low. The station group retains a high level of integrity, with sympathetic modern additions. = Modifications and dates = *1927: Electrification of the North Shore line between Milson's Point and Hornsby was opened on 15 August 1927. *1928: Full electric services were provided 15 July 1928, and included services at Gordon. With electrification came automatic signalling and most signal boxes were closed. However, Gordon Signal Box remained in service until recent years (as with other North Shore signal boxes including North Sydney, Chatswood, Lindfield) due to the need for local control of terminating trains. When the principal signal control centres were opened at Sydney and Hornsby, these local signal boxes were closed, including Gordon. With electrification of the North Shore line, a relatively small 1500 V DC substation was built adjacent to the down North Shore line at Gordon. *1990s: The former Gordon substation was replaced by a modern DC substation on the opposite side of the line and the original substation building (brick) was demolished. *N.d: Some relatively modern additions such as shelters / awnings have been provided on the island platform. Transport links Forest Coach Lines operates three routes to and from Gordon station: *195: to St Ives Chase Loop service *196: to Mona Vale *197: to Mona Vale & Macquarie University Transdev NSW operates three routes to and from Gordon station: *560: to West Pymble Loop Service *562: to Macquarie University *582: to St Ives Gordon is served by one NightRide route: *N90: Hornsby station to City (Town Hall)  Heritage listing  As at 26 October 2010, Gordon Railway Station Group is significant at a state level as an excellent representative example of an early 20th century suburban station building group located on the North Shore line, which retains a high degree of integrity and quality in its architectural detail. The station group demonstrates the importance of the role of the railway in opening up the areas of the northern suburbs of Sydney for settlement at this time. It is able to evoke an earlier era of rail travel through its grouping of the original Platform 2/3 station building, platforms and booking office, along with sympathetic later additions. The station contributes to the cohesive character of the North Shore line, characterised by its early 20th century railway architecture, generally in landscaped settings, which demonstrates the rapid construction of this section of the rail network. Gordon station stands out in the North Shore group of stations, due to its overhead booking office, which is an unusual feature in this region. Gordon railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Gordon Railway Station is historically significant at a state level. Opened in 1890, Gordon Station was one of the first stations along the North Shore line, and demonstrates the role of the railway in facilitating the rapid subdivision and development of the northern suburbs of Sydney. The elements that contribute to this significance include the 1909-1910 station building, booking office, overhead walkway, and platforms. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. As a complex, Gordon Railway Station is of state aesthetic significance as a fine example of an early 20th Century railway station along the North Shore line, which retains a high degree of integrity and quality of detail. The elaborate nature of its architectural detail is perhaps indicative of the importance of Gordon Railway Station as an early intermediate terminus along the North Shore line. This station building contributes to the cohesive group of 20th century railway architecture which is characteristic of the northern section of the rail network, and demonstrates the rapid historical construction of the North Shore line. The reconstructed waiting room contributes to the general early 20th century character of the Gordon Railway Station, and is a physical record of one the earliest structures at the station, although in itself it has little heritage value. The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Gordon Railway Station has social significance as evidenced by the community involvement during the design and construction of the new lifts and access arrangements. Local historical societies are also known to include the station complex in historical tours of the local area, thereby demonstrating the high esteem held by particular members of the community for the Gordon Railway Station. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The location of the booking office on the overbridge is rare along the North Shore line, which is perhaps indicative of the importance of Gordon Railway Station as an early terminus along this line. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Gordon Railway Station is of representative significance at a state level as an early 20th century railway station complex. Elements that contribute to this significance include the 1909 station building, overbridge and platforms. The footbridge is a good representative example of such structures, of which 28 were constructed in Metropolitan Sydney, with a number still remain within the metro network.

A drawing of John Thwaites in 1858. Background Thwaites was a native of Maulds Meaburn, Westmorland where his father was a farmer. He attended Reagill School. As the third son he was not expected to follow in his father's stead, and went to London in 1832 to work for Henry Bardwell, a woollen draper on Holborn Hill; in 1835, he became a partner in the business, which had a base on Oxford Street. In 1842, he left to establish his own company at 18 Blackman Street in The Borough; it later moved to 61-2 Borough High Street. Municipal work His religion led Thwaites into municipal affairs. He was a Strict Baptist and preached at several locations including the Surrey Tabernacle (where he was Deacon for sixteen years), St Mary's Newington Butts, St Paul's Deptford and St Saviour; this led to opportunities to be a churchwarden and Guardian of the Poor. He became known for his work with the local community and was Chairman of the Guardians. Thwaites also acted to support local business: when he discovered there was a monopoly on the supply of gas in Southwark, Thwaites set up the Surrey Gas Consumers company in 1849, a mutual association of businesses, to get alternative and much cheaper supplies. He was made a member of more than one Vestry, which handled local government for the parish, and was also delegated to the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers from Southwark. He knew the problem of sewerage (the most pressing problem in London) well enough to write a well-received and knowledgeable pamphlet about it. Politically, Thwaites supported Parliamentary Reform and the Liberal Party, especially Apsley Pellatt who was Liberal MP for Southwark. He also supported the early closing movement which campaigned to allow shopworkers more time off work. On the MBW In 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works was established to co-ordinate work throughout London, to be composed of delegates from the Vestries. Thwaites was selected by two different Vestries to be their delegate, and his involvement across London and on the Commission of Sewers led to his election by the Board to be their Chairman on 22 December 1855. Thwaites therefore became responsible for the wholescale construction of a sewerage system, as well as street works and other infrastructure. He was fortunate in obtaining the services of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, formerly Deputy Chief Engineer to the Commission of Sewers, as the Board's Chief Engineer. Thwaites persuaded the Government to give responsibility for the construction of the Victoria Embankment, which was part of the new drainage, to the Metropolitan Board. A Royal Commission had recommended a special body of commissioners take responsibility. The embankment was held up by delays in the construction of the Metropolitan District Railway, and eventually Thwaites went ahead without it; the railway was put in later. Honours and death When the main drainage was complete in 1865, Thwaites was knighted. The Victoria Embankment was finally completed and opened in July 1870, a few weeks before Thwaites' death. His illness was caused partly by overwork which contributed to his problems from diabetes, but ironically, in view of his work on building London's sewerage system, Thwaites died of cholera at his Wandsworth home. He was followed in the job of chairman by James Macnaghten Hogg MP. As a Leader, Thwaites was respected but regarded as somewhat formal. He was nicknamed The Stiff'un by the Board's staff. He tried to keep involved in all aspects of the Board and insisted that those who were too infirm or too old should retire. He was described as having \\"a stony gaze and a sepulchral voice\\".

History and naming of the island The name \\"Orcas\\" is a shortened form of Horcasitas, or Juan Vicente de G√ºemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the Viceroy of Mexico who sent an exploration expedition under Francisco de Eliza to the Pacific Northwest in 1791. During the voyage, Eliza explored part of the San Juan Islands. He did not apply the name Orcas specifically to Orcas Island, but rather to part of the archipelago. In 1847, Henry Kellett assigned the name Orcas to Orcas Island during his reorganization of the British Admiralty charts. Kellett's work eliminated the patriotically American names that Charles Wilkes had given to many features of the San Juans during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838‚Äì1842. Wilkes had named Orcas Island \\"Hull Island\\", after Commodore Isaac Hull. Other features of Orcas Island named by Wilkes include \\"Ironsides Inlet\\" for East Sound and \\"Guerrier Bay\\" for West Sound. One of the names Wilkes gave remains: Mount Constitution. Wilkes' names follow a pattern: Isaac Hull was the commander of \\"Old Ironsides\\" (the ') and won fame after capturing the British warship Guerriere in the War of 1812. The islands were first claimed by Spain, then by Britain, who agreed that all below the 49th parallel was part of the US, in the treaty signed after the War of 1812. The Oregon territory, which then included Washington state and this island, was used jointly by the US and Britain until 1848, but border disputes specifically concerning the San Juan Islands, including the Pig War (1859), were not settled until 1871. The similarity to the name of the orca, which is popularly associated with coastal Washington state, is coincidental. Geography With a land area of 57.3 square miles (148.4 km¬≤) and a population of 5,387 (2010 census), Orcas Island is slightly larger, but less populous, than neighboring San Juan Island. Orcas is shaped like a pair of saddlebags, separated by fjord-like Eastsound, and 2 prominent bays, Westsound and Deer Harbor, on the southwest side. At the northern end of the island is the village of Eastsound, the largest population center on Orcas and the second largest in San Juan County. Other, smaller hamlets on the island include Orcas Landing (where the inter-island/mainland ferry lands), West Sound (with Eastsound addresses), Deer Harbor, Rosario (with Eastsound addresses), Olga and Doe Bay. There are a number of former settlements that no longer exist, which were mostly built up around the lime kiln and fruit growing industries. Island access The state supports island access through the Washington State Ferries system. In addition, the island can be accessed through a variety of air, seaplane and sea charter services. Private watercraft can use public docks located near the villages around the island, and various public shoreline access points. During the summer season, there is an island shuttle van that runs from the ferry landing to Eastsound and other points. Museums * The Orcas Island Historical Museum is located down town Eastsound and is the only object-based, interpretive heritage facility for the island, with a permanent collection containing approximately 6000 objects, paper documents and photographs. *Crow Valley School Museum is a one-room school house built in 1888, open by appoint only. * Orcas Island is also home to three historic camps: Camp Orkila, Four Winds Westward Ho and Camp Indralaya. Public services The Orcas Island School District operates three schools on a single campus: Orcas Island Elementary School housed in the island's historic Nellie S. Milton school building; Orcas Island Middle School; and Orcas Island High School. All of the island's public schools are located in Eastsound. The Orcas Island Public Library is located in Eastsound and serves a population of approximately 6,000 card holders. The Orcas Island Library District is a junior-taxing district that funds the Orcas Island Public Library's operating budget through property taxes. The annual Library Fair sells books donated by Orcas Island residents and visitors, the proceeds of which are donated back to the Library's operating budget. In 2018 Orcas Island Voters approved the creation of San Juan County Public Hospital District #3 (OIHCD) and later elected five Commissioners to the board. OIHCD funds local health care services ensuring care services to locals.  Parks  =Village Green= The Village Green is located in the center of Eastsound village.

The United States obtained Shaw Island and the rest of the San Juan archipelago by treaty in 1855, but Lummi retained certain cultural and resource rights, including fishing. The Wilkes Expedition, in 1841, named the island after John Shaw, a United States Naval Officer. According to Bill Tsilixw James, hereditary chief of the Lummi Nation, the Lummi know the island as Sq'emenen. A San Juan Island resident proposed to the state Board of Geographic Names in 2015 that Squaw Bay be renamed Sq'emenen Bay; that proposal generated a compromise proposal from the Shaw Island Historical Society to rename the bay Reef Net Bay, in recognition of the reef net fishing historically and currently done there.

These include commercial recreational facilities; transient accommodations by themselves or in combination with any commercial use, food service facilities, and transient moorage and dry storage facilities. Nuns There have been three Catholic religious institutes of nuns on Shaw Island. Benedictine nuns established a monastery on in the 1970s; while the Sisters of Mercy have owned an unofficial retreat on the island since the 1980s. Nuns of the Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist ran the island's only store and the ferry terminal for almost 3 decades, until 2004, relocating elsewhere . Historical structures Shaw Island School District #10, has an operational historic one-room school (although a second room was later added), with classes for kindergarten through eighth grade students.

This area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to Middle Harbour and north to the entrance of Broken Bay. The area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country. The Northern Beaches district is governed on a local level by the Northern Beaches Council, which was formed in May 2016 from Warringah Council (est. 1906), Manly Council (est. 1877), and Pittwater Council (est. 1992). History =Early history= Barrenjoey Head Lighthouse, Palm Beach, New South Wales, Australia The traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the land now known as the Northern Beaches were the Kuringgai people of the Eora nation. Within a few years of European settlement, the Kuringgai had mostly disappeared from this area mainly due to an outbreak of smallpox in 1789. Much evidence of their habitation remains especially their rock etchings in Kuring-gai Chase National Park which borders northern beaches's north-western side. The northern beaches region was explored early on in the settlement of Sydney, only a few weeks after the arrival of the First Fleet. However, it remained a rural area for most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, with only small settlements in the valleys between headlands. While it was geographically close to the city centre, to reach the area over land from Sydney via Mona Vale Road was a trip of more than . Since those days, urban growth proceeded slowly until the 1960s when development accelerated because of improved roads and a general increase in living standards in the regions.https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/historic-buildings- places/barrenjoey-lighthouse In 1906, the Warringah Shire council was formed the NSW Government Gazette, along with 132 other new Shires within New South Wales. It ran roughly from Broken Bay in the north to Manly Lagoon to the south, and by Middle Harbour Creek and Cowan Creek in the west. Pittwater was incooperated as the \\"A Riding\\" of Warringah Shire, however for many years there existed a sentiment held by some in A Riding, the northern Riding and the largest in Warringah, taking up more than 40% of Warringah's land area, that they were being increasingly ignored and subject to what they considered inappropriate development and policies for their area. http://www.pittwater.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/pittwater_secession This culminated in 1991 when a non-compulsory postal poll of the residents of A Riding was taken over the question of a possible secession. This resulted in a 73.5% vote in favour of secession, however only 48.18% of residents took part in this vote. This vote was, however, 600 short of the total majority required. Over time, the Northern Beaches was often divided by the \\"Lower Northern Beaches\\", referring to the southern end of the region, and the \\"Upper Northern Beaches\\", referring to the northern end of the region (North Narrabeen to Palm Beach). In 2016, the Local Government (Council Amalgamations) Proclamation 2016 insisted that the Northern Beaches region councils of Manly, Warringah and Pittwater become the Northern Beaches Council. This was effective from the 12th of May 2016.https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/regulations/2016-242.pdf Today, the Northern Beaches is very well part of the Sydney metropolis, however maintains an isolated environment from the other regions of Sydney including the neighboring North Shore region.

Over the 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth, tectonic upheavals and colliding plates have raised great mountain ranges while the forces of erosion and weathering worked to tear them down. Even after many millions of years, records of Earth's great upheavals remain imprinted as textural variations and surface patterns that define distinctive landscapes or provinces. The diversity of the landscapes of the United States can be easily seen on the shaded relief image to the right. The stark contrast between the ‚Äòrough' texture of the western US and the ‚Äòsmooth' central and eastern regions is immediately apparent. Differences in roughness (topographic relief) result from a variety of processes acting on the underlying rock. The plate tectonic history of a region strongly influences the rock type and structure exposed at the surface, but differing rates of erosion that accompany changing climates can also have profound impacts on the land. There are twelve main geological provinces in the United States: Pacific, Columbia Plateau, Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, Rocky Mountains, Laurentian Upland, Interior Plains, Interior Highlands, Appalachian Highlands, Atlantic Plain, Alaskan, and Hawaiian. Each province has its own geologic history and unique features. This article will describe each province in turn. Pacific Province This region is one of the most geologically young and tectonically active in North America. The generally rugged, mountainous landscape of this province provides evidence of ongoing mountain-building. The Pacific Province straddles the boundaries between several of Earth's moving plates:the source of the monumental forces required to build the sweeping arc of mountains that extends from Alaska to the southern reaches of South America. This province includes the active and sometimes deadly volcanoes of the Cascade Range and the young, steep mountains of the Pacific Border and the Sierra Nevada. =Sierra Nevada= deep underground. Although the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range form a nearly continuous barrier along the western edge of the United States, the two ranges really have very little in common. They have been and continue to be formed by quite different geological forces and processes. The rocks that form the backbone of the Sierra Nevada are mostly granitic rocks that formed during the Mesozoic Era, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. At that time, an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes, similar to the present-day Cascade volcanic arc, erupted where the Sierra Nevada now stands. Rising through older Paleozoic rock, molten rock erupted at the surface as lava, but most solidified deep within the earth, forming the gray granitic rocks familiar to any Sierra traveler. Although from a distance the Sierran rock looks quite similar, it is actually made up of many individual rock bodies that formed from repeated intrusions of magma over many millions of years. Even as they grew, erosion was wearing away these Mesozoic Era volcanoes. By Late Cretaceous time, about 70 million years ago, the once-deep granitic rocks began to be exposed at the Earth's surface. By a few tens of millions of years ago, so much of the upper part had worn away that the surface of the ancient range had a low relief of just a few thousand feet. It wasn't until quite recently, geologically-speaking, that the Sierra Nevada range as we know it today began to grow. During the Miocene Epoch, less than 20 million years ago, the continental crust east of the Sierra Nevada began to stretch in an east‚Äìwest direction. The crust broke into a series of north‚Äìsouth-trending valleys and mountain ranges: the beginning of the Basin and Range province. The height of the Sierra Nevada is caused by a fault on the eastern side of the mountains. Less than five million years ago, the range that we now know as the Sierra Nevada began to rise along its eastern margin. Through a combination of uplift of the Sierran block and down-dropping of the area to the east, the Sierra rose upward. Rising far more steeply to the east than the west, the entire Sierra Nevada can be thought of as an enormous tilted fault block with a long, gentle slope westward to California's Central Valley and steep eastern slope. Not long after the Sierra uplift began, the Earth cooled, marking the beginning of the Pleistocene (Ice Age) Epoch. Glaciers grew in the Sierra highlands and made their way down former stream channels, carving U-shaped valleys. The sheer walls and hanging valleys of Yosemite National Park are a product of this chilly past. =Cascades Volcanic Province= Where the Sierra Nevada ends a chain of explosive volcanic centers, the Cascade volcanoes, begins. The Cascades Province forms an arc-shaped band extending from British Columbia to Northern California, roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline. Within this region, 13 major volcanic centers lie in sequence like a string of explosive pearls. Although the largest volcanoes like Mount St. Helens get the most attention, the Cascades is really made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes that dominate the landscape. The Cascades volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. As if volcanic hazards were not enough, the Ring of Fire is also infamous for its frequent earthquakes. In order to understand the origins of this concentrated band of Earth hazards, we have to slice deep into the Earth. The Cascade Range is formed by an active continental margin A slice of the Earth from the Pacific Ocean through the Pacific Northwest might look something like the adjacent image. Beneath the Cascades, a dense oceanic plate plunges beneath the North American Plate; a process known as subduction. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Range) above the subduction zone. Geological map of the Cascade Range. Yellow indicates earthquakes, black lines indicate faults A close-up look at the Cascades reveals a more complicated picture than the simple subduction zone shown in the image on theleft. Not far off the coast of the North Pacific lies a spreading ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where new ocean crust is created. On one side of the spreading ridge new Pacific Plate crust is made, then moves away from the ridge. On the other side of the spreading ridge the Juan de Fuca Plate and Gorda Plate move eastward. There are some unusual features at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca Plate sinks beneath the North American Plate there is no deep trench, seismicity (earthquakes) are fewer than expected, and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American Plates. These two plates converge at 3‚Äì4 centimeters per year at present. This is only about half the rate of convergence of 7 million years ago. The small Juan de Fuca Plate and two platelets, the Explorer Plate and Gorda Plate are the meager remnants of the much larger Farallon oceanic plate. The Explorer Plate broke away from the Juan de Fuca about 4 million years ago and shows no evidence that it is still being subducted. The Gorda platelet split away between 18 and 5 million years ago and continues to sink beneath North America. The Cascade Range made its first appearance 36 million years ago, but the major peaks that rise up from today's volcanic centers were born within the last 1.6 million years (during the Pleistocene). More than 3000 vents erupted during the most recent volcanic episode that began 5 million years ago. As long as subduction continues, new Cascade volcanoes will continue to rise. Columbia Plateau The Columbia Plateau covers part of three states The Columbia Plateau province is enveloped by one of the world's largest accumulations of lava. Over of the Earth's surface is covered by it. The topography here is dominated by geologically young lava flows that inundated the countryside with amazing speed, all within the last 17 million years. Over of basaltic lava, known as the Columbia River basalts, covers the western part of the province. These tremendous flows erupted between 17 million years ago. Most of the lava flooded out in the first 1.5 million years: an extraordinarily short time for such an outpouring of molten rock. A map of the Snake River Plain, showing its smooth topography The Snake River Plain stretches across Oregon, through northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and ends at the Yellowstone Plateau in Wyoming. Looking like a great spoon scooped out the Earth surface, the smooth topography of this province forms a striking contrast with the strong mountainous fabric around it. The Snake River Plain lies in a distinct depression. At the western end, the base has dropped down along normal faults, forming a graben structure. Although there is extensive faulting at the eastern end, the structure is not as clear. Like the Columbia River region, volcanic eruptions dominate the story of the Snake River Plain in the eastern part of the Columbia Plateau Province. The earliest Snake River Plain eruptions began about 15 million years ago, just as the tremendous early eruptions of Columbia River Basalt were ending. But most of the Snake River Plain volcanic rock is less than a few million years old, Pliocene age (5-1.6 million years ago) and younger. In the west, the Columbia River Basalts are just that-almost exclusively black basalt. Not so in the Snake River Plain, where relatively quiet eruptions of soupy black basalt lava flows alternated with tremendous explosive eruptions of rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock. Cinder cones dot the landscape of the Snake River Plain. Some are aligned along vents, the fissures that fed flows and cone-building eruptions. Calderas, great pits formed by explosive volcanism, and low shield volcanoes, and rhyolite hills are also part of the landscape here, but many are obscured by later lava flows. Geologists usually associate volcanic eruptions with the boundaries between colliding or diverging plates. However, the focus of volcanism at Yellowstone in the Columbia Plateau Province is far inland from the subduction zone that lies along the Oregon and Washington coast. Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province, at the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth's moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau, and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas. Mammoth Hot Springs is evidence of Yellowstone thermal activity A probable explanation is that a hot spot, an extremely hot plume of deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. We know that beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at the boundary between the core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth. When the hot plume arrives at the base of the lithosphere, some of the lighter rock of the lithosphere rapidly melts. It is this molten lithosphere that becomes the basalt lavas that gush onto the surface to form the Columbia River and Snake River Plain basalts. The track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to Yellowstone National Park. The steaming fumaroles and explosive geysers are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hot spot is stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a record of the rate and direction of plate motion. Basin and Range The Basin and Range Province includes much of western North America. In the United States, it is bordered on the west by the eastern fault scarp of the Sierra Nevada and spans over to its eastern border marked by the Wasatch Fault, the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande Rift. The Basin and Range Province extends north to the Columbia Plateau and south as far as the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico, though the southern boundaries of the Basin and Range are debated. The Basin and Range province has a characteristic topography that is familiar to anyone who ventures across it. Steep climbs up elongate mountain ranges alternate with long treks across flat, dry deserts. This basic topographic pattern extends from eastern California to central Utah, and from southern Idaho into the state of Sonora in Mexico. The forces which created this distinct topography lie deep beneath the surface. The Basin and Range province, in central Nevada, as seen from space. Within the Basin and Range Province, the Earth's crust (and upper mantle) has been stretched up to 100% of its original width. The entire region has been subjected to extension that thinned and cracked the crust as it was pulled apart, creating large faults. Along these roughly north‚Äìsouth-trending faults mountains were uplifted and valleys down-dropped, producing the distinctive alternating pattern of linear mountain ranges and valleys of the Basin and Range province. Although there are other types of faults in the Basin and Range province, the extension and crustal stretching that have shaped the present landscape produce mostly normal faults. The upthrown side of these faults form mountains that rise abruptly and steeply, and the down-dropped side creates low valleys. The fault plane, along which the two sides of the fault move, extends deep in the crust, usually an angle of 60 degrees. In places, the relief or vertical difference between the two sides is as much as . As the rocky ranges rise, they are immediately subject to weathering and erosion. The exposed bedrock is attacked by water, ice, wind and other erosional agents. Rock particles are stripped away and wash down the mountain sides, often covering young faults until they rupture again. Sediment collects in the adjacent valleys, in some places burying the bedrock under thousands of feet of rock debris. Clarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an \\"army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico\\", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with The Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage). =Great Basin= The Great Basin is the geographical and hydrological region comprising most of Nevada, southern Oregon and Idaho, western Utah, and a little of eastern California. Characterized by internal drainage, this region's surface water sources evaporate or percolate before they can flow to the ocean. The Basin and Range province's dynamic fault history has profoundly affected the Great Basin's water drainage system. Most precipitation in the Great Basin falls in the form of snow that melts in the spring. Rain that reaches the ground, or snow that melts, quickly evaporates in the dry desert environment. Some of the water that does not evaporate sinks into the ground to become ground water. The remaining water flows into streams and collects in short-lived lakes called playas on the valley floor and eventually evaporates. Any water that falls as rain or snow into this region does not escape out of it; not one of the streams that originate within this basin ever find an outlet to the ocean. The extent of internal drainage, the area in which surface water cannot reach the ocean, defines the geographic region called the Great Basin. The Great Basin's internal drainage results from blockage of water movement by high fault-created mountains and by lack of sufficient water flow to merge with larger drainages outside of the Great Basin. This internally-drained area occupies approximately , including most of Nevada, a large part of Utah, and portions of Idaho, California, and Oregon. Much of the present-day Great Basin would drain to the sea, just as it did in the recent Ice Ages, if there were more rain and snowfall. Colorado Plateau The Colorado Plateau is roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. The sculptured beauty and brilliant colors of the Colorado Plateau's sedimentary rock layers have captured the imaginations of countless geologists. This is a vast region of plateaus, mesas, and deep canyons whose walls expose rocks ranging in age from billions to just a few hundred years old. Ancient Precambrian rocks, exposed only in the deepest canyons, make up the basement of the Colorado Plateau. Most are metamorphic rocks formed deep within the Earth while continental collision on a grand scale produced the nucleus of the North American continent well over a billion years ago. Igneous rocks injected millions of years later form a marbled network through parts of the Colorado Plateau's darker metamorphic basement. Cedar Mesa Sandstone forms the Druid Arch, in Canyonlands National Park These deeply-formed rocks were uplifted, eroded, and exposed for eons. By 600 million years ago, North America had been beveled off to a remarkably smooth surface. It is on this crystalline rock surface that the younger, more familiar layered rocks of the Colorado Plateau were deposited. Throughout the Paleozoic Era, the Colorado Plateau region was periodically inundated by tropical seas. Thick layers of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale were laid down in the shallow marine waters. During times when the seas retreated, stream deposits and dune sands were deposited or older layers were removed by erosion. Over 300 million years passed as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated. Crossbedded Navajo Sandstone in Zion National Park It was not until the upheavals that coincided with the formation of the supercontinent Pangea began about 250 million years ago that deposits of marine sediment waned and terrestrial deposits dominate. The Mesozoic Era sedimentary deposits are striking. Great accumulations of dune sand hardened to form sweeping arcs in cross-bedded sandstone. Eruptions from volcanic mountain ranges to the west buried vast regions beneath ashy debris. Short-lived rivers, lakes, and inland seas left sedimentary records of their passage. One of the most geologically intriguing features of the Colorado Plateau is its remarkable stability. Relatively little rock deformation (e.g., faulting and folding) has affected this high, thick crustal block within the last 600 million years or so. In contrast, the plateau is surrounded by provinces that have suffered severe deformation. Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth-stretching tension created the Basin and Range Province to the west and south. Although the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau may seem to have little in common, their geological stories are intimately intertwined. In the early part of this Era (Paleogene Period), both regions had low elevations of probably less than 1 kilometer. Geologists are still gathering evidence and debating what came next. Colorado and Green rivers Beginning about 20 million years ago, during the Miocene Epoch, both the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau regions were uplifted as much as 3 kilometers. Great tension developed in the crust, probably related to changing plate motions far to the west. As the crust stretched, the Basin and Range Province broke up into a multitude of down-dropped valleys and elongate mountains. Yet for some reason not fully understood, the neighboring Colorado Plateau was able to preserve its structural integrity and remained a single tectonic block. Eventually, the great block of Colorado Plateau crust rose a kilometer higher than the Basin and Range. As the land rose, the streams responded by cutting ever deeper stream channels. The most well-known of these streams, the Colorado River, began to carve the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago. The forces of erosion have exposed the vivid kaleidoscope of rock layers that make the Colorado Plateau a mecca for rock lovers. Rocky Mountain System Cathedral Group, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming The Rockies form a majestic mountain barrier that stretches from Canada through central New Mexico. Although formidable, a look at the topography reveals a discontinuous series of mountain ranges with distinct geological origins. The rocks making up the mountains were formed before the mountains were raised. The cores of the mountain ranges are in most places formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old. In the south, an older mountain range was formed 300 million years ago, then eroded away. The rocks of that older range were reformed into the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains took shape during a period of intense plate tectonic activity that formed much of the rugged landscape of the western United States. Three major mountain-building episodes reshaped the west from about 170 to 40 million years ago (Jurassic to Cenozoic Periods). The last mountain building event, the Laramide orogeny, (about 70-40 million years ago) the last of the three episodes, is responsible for raising the Rocky Mountains. During the last half of the Mesozoic Era, the Age of the Dinosaurs, much of today's California, Oregon, and Washington were added to North America. western North America suffered the effects of repeated collision as slabs of ocean crust sank beneath the continental edge. Slivers of continental crust, carried along by subducting ocean plates, were swept into the subduction zone and scraped onto North America's edge. About 200‚Äì300 miles inland, magma generated above the subducting slab rose into the North American continental crust. Great arc-shaped volcanic mountain ranges grew as lava and ash spewed out of dozens of individual volcanoes. Beneath the surface, great masses of molten rock were injected and hardened in place. For 100 million years the effects of plate collisions were focused very near the edge of the North American plate boundary, far to the west of the Rocky Mountain region. It was not until 70 million years ago that these effects began to reach the Rockies. The growth of the Rocky Mountains has been one of the most perplexing of geologic puzzles. Normally, mountain building is focused between 200 and 400 miles inland from a subduction zone boundary, yet the Rockies are hundreds of miles farther inland. Although geologists continue to gather evidence to explain the rise of the Rockies, the answer most likely lies with an unusual subducting slab. At a 'typical' subduction zone, an oceanic plate typically sinks at a fairly high angle (see above). A volcanic arc grows above the subducting plate. During the growth of the Rocky Mountains, the angle of the subducting plate may have been significantly flattened, moving the focus of melting and mountain building much farther inland than is normally expected. The Laramide orogeny was caused by subduction at an unusually shallow angle. It is postulated that the shallow angle of the subducting plate greatly increased the friction and other interactions with the thick continental mass above it. Tremendous thrusts piled sheets of crust on top of each other, building the extraordinarily broad, high Rocky Mountain range. As of 60 million years ago, the Rockies were like Tibet: a high plateau, probably above sea level. Since then, erosion stripped away the high rocks, revealing the ancestral rocks beneath, and forming the current landscape of the Rockies. Periods of glaciation occurred from the Pleistocene Epoch (1.8 million‚Äì70,000 years ago) to the Holocene Epoch (fewer than 11,000 years ago). The ice ages left their mark on the Rockies, forming extensive glacial landforms, such as U-shaped valleys and cirques. Laurentian Upland Every continent has a core of very ancient metamorphic rocks. The Superior Upland Province is the southern extension of the Laurentian Upland Province, part of the nucleus of North America called Canadian Shield. The basement rocks of the Laurentian Upland Province were metamorphosed about 2500 million years ago in a mountain-building collision of tectonic plates called the Kenoran Orogeny. The rocks of the Superior Upland are mostly Precambrian metamorphic rocks and overlying Paleozoic rocks (Cambrian) covered by a thin veneer of glacial deposits left behind when glaciers melted at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age. If we could strip away all of the younger rocks deposited on top of buried Precambrian basement, you would see a landscape of low relief. The topography of the Precambrian rocks is very subdued, with barely 500 feet difference between the highest point and the lowest. Clearly, this region was exposed to a very long period of erosion in the very distant past which beveled the original mountainous surface to a gently undulating surface. The present surface is not much different. Hills rise just a few hundred feet above the surrounding countryside. The highest of these, such as Rib Hill, Wisconsin, are made up mostly of resistant quartzite or granite. The north shore of Lake Superior showing lava that erupted more than 1 billion years ago The structure of Superior Upland rock is quite complex. Folds and faults, most dating back to Precambrian time, record several episodes of mountain-building. The plate collisions that formed the core of our continent left behind a striking structural trend. Ridges and valleys are strongly aligned along this northeast‚Äìsouthwest trend. Lake Superior is an example of this northeast‚Äìsouthwest structural trend. Ridges of erosion-resistant rock rise above valleys and carved into weaker rock units. The effects of repeated glaciation have left their mark on the Superior Upland. The present glacial topography is the product of the most recent glaciation that ended just 10,000 years ago. During the Late Wisconsin, the last glaciation of the Pleistocene Epoch, a massive continental ice sheet grew first in the north, then gradually expanded southward. Several thick finger- like lobes of glacial ice engulfed the region as they moved through the Superior basin. Rocks of all sizes were plucked and scoured from farther north and carried along by the icy mass. When the continental ice sheets melt, they left behind an assortment of rock called glacial drift that covers much of the Superior Upland landscape. Interior Plains The Interior Plains is a vast region that spreads across the stable core of North America. This area had formed when several small continents collided and welded together well over a billion years ago, during the Precambrian. Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks now form the basement of the Interior Plains and make up the stable nucleus of North America. With the exception of the Black Hills of South Dakota, the entire region has low relief, reflecting more than 500 million years of relative tectonic stability. Throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras the mostly low-lying Interior Plains region remained relatively unaffected by the mountain-building tectonic collisions suffered by the western and eastern margins of the continent. Prairie and low hills in the Oglala National Grassland, Nebraska During much of the Mesozoic Era, the North American continental interior was mostly well above sea level, with two notable exceptions. During part of the Jurassic (208-144 million years ago), rising seas flooded the low-lying areas of the continent. Much of the Interior Plains eventually lay submerged beneath the shallow Sundance Sea. Sediments eroding from the rising Rocky Mountains to the west washed into the sea and deposited as layered wedges of fine debris. As sand, mud, and clays accumulated, the Sundance Sea retreated northward. Preserved within the multi- hued sandstones, mudstones, and clays that made up the shoreline, are the remains of countless dinosaurs that roamed the Sundance coast. The fossil assemblages concealed within the sedimentary layers of the Morrison Formation are among the world's richest. In some areas, bones of many dinosaurs are concentrated in a very small area, indicating that they were carried during floods, then deposited together beside a stream. Once again, during the Cretaceous Period (144-65 million years ago), record high sea levels flooded the continental interior with shallow seas. The Interior Plains continued to receive deposits from the eroding Rocky Mountains to the west and Appalachian and Ozark/Ouachita Mountains to the east and south throughout the most recent Era, the Cenozoic. The flatness of the Interior Plains is a reflection of the platform of mostly flat-lying marine and stream deposits laid down in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. Appalachians, Interior Highlands, and Atlantic Plains Paleogeographic reconstruction showing the Appalachian Basin area during the Middle Devonian period. The rocks of the Appalachian, Ouachita, Ozark Mountains are old and share a common origin. They largely consist of sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age that were deposited on the sea floor and are presently folded and faulted. The Appalachians also have volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient sea floor. These mountains were once part of a mighty uplifted mountain range that stretch from the Appalachian Highlands through Texas. During the earliest Paleozoic Era, the continent that would later become North America straddled the equator. The Appalachian region was a passive plate margin, not unlike today's Atlantic Coastal Plain Province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallows seas. Thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock was deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated. During the middle Ordovician Period (about 440‚Äì480 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once quiet, Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. Animation of Pangea breaking up This was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians. Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years (Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghenian orogenies). The Pangean supercontinent began to take shape. Microplates, smaller bits of crust too small to be called continents, were swept in, one by one, to be welded to the growing mass. By about 300 million years ago (Pennsylvanian Period) Africa was approaching North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the Ozark-Ouachita region and through the Marathon Mountains of Texas. Continent vs. continent collision raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to lofty, Himalayan-scale ranges. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic Era (Permian Period) when Africa (Gondwana) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the core. From about 280-230 million years ago, (Late Paleozoic Era until the Late Triassic) the continent we now know as North America was continuous with Africa, South America, and Europe. During the Late Triassic, Pangea began to be torn apart when a three-pronged fissure grew between Africa, South America, and North America. Rifting began as magma welled up through the weakness in the crust, creating a volcanic rift zone. Volcanic eruptions spewed ash and volcanic debris across the landscape as these severed continent-sized fragments of Pangea diverged. The gash between the spreading continents gradually grew to form a new ocean basin, the Atlantic. The rift zone known as the mid-Atlantic ridge continued to provide the raw volcanic materials for the expanding ocean basin. North America was slowly pulled westward away from the rift zone. The thick continental crust that made up the new east coast collapsed into a series of down-dropped fault blocks that roughly parallel today's coastline. At first, the hot, faulted edge of the continent was high and buoyant relative to the new ocean basin. As the edge of North America moved away from the hot rift zone, it began to cool and subside beneath the new Atlantic Ocean. This once-active divergent plate boundary became the passive, trailing edge of westward moving North America. In plate tectonic terms, the Atlantic Plain is known as a classic example of a passive continental margin. During the rifting, South America tore away from North America and headed southward. The ocean flooded into the opening between the two continents, forming the Gulf of Mexico. A record of this rifting event remains as an indelible mark on the landscape called Mississippi Embayment. It is this embayment that ripped the dramatic gap between the southern Appalachians and the Ouachita-Ozark Highlands. Weathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away. By the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian-Ouachita Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain. Sediments eroded from these highlands were carried east and southward by streams and gradually covered the faulted continental margin, burying it under a wedge, thousands of feet thick, of layered sedimentary and volcanic debris. Today most Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rock layers that lie beneath much of the coastal plain and fringing continental shelf remain nearly horizontal or tilt gently toward the sea. During the Cenozoic, the geology of the different regions diverged. The Appalachians started to uplift, while the Ouachita and Ozarks did not. The uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures. Alaska Most of Alaska consists of terranes accreted by collisions with island arcs carried in over the last 160 million years. These terranes were caused by the subduction of the Farallon, Kula, and Pacific plates sequentially. Currently, the Pacific plate is subducting beneath Alaska, producing the Aleutian arc series of volcanoes through the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands. One of the sutures left by terrane addition is the Denali Fault, which curves through south-central Alaska. The Denali Fault bends just north of Denali. The combination of the subduction of the Pacific plate and the bend in the Denali Fault causes Denali to be the highest mountain in North America. Hawaii The State of Hawaii consists of a chain of islands, or archipelago. The archipelago developed as the Pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at a rate of approximately per million years. Thus, the southeast island (Hawaii) is volcanically active whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods. From this study and others, it is estimated that the northwesternmost island, the Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while Hawaii, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on Hawaii and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Loihi. Almost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaii are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.

It is 37 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council, in the Northern Beaches region. The area was previously called Avalon, with the name Avalon Beach being assigned during a change in boundaries and names in the Pittwater region in 2012.  History  The Pittwater and Northern Beaches area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country. = European settlement = Avalon was named after the mythical Avalon, a legendary island in Celtic languages mythology. According to legends, Avalon was an earthly paradise and the final resting place of King Arthur.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 13 The first land grant in the area was to John Farrell in 1827. In 1833 a land grant was made to Australia's first Catholic priest, John Joseph Therry, by Governor Bourke. A further grant of 280 acres made in 1837 meant that Therry's holdings covered most of the peninsula from Newport to Whale Beach. He built a church in this area but his plans for a settlement never eventuated. Therry fought hard for the recognition of the Catholic Church in the colony. After he died, the land was left to the Jesuit order and was then sold to help finance the rebuilding of St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. In the 1920s, the area was still known as 'Priest's Flat'. Arthur J Small handled a subdivision in 1921 and chose the name Avalon. Lots were sold for ¬£100 each and included two year's free membership in the local golf club. Significant housing developments took place during the 1920s. The architect Alexander Stewart Jolly designed a number of houses that were built in the Avalon area in that period. Loggan Rock was a flamboyant log cabin combined with a stone tower; the combination of logs and rocks gave rise to the name. The house is heritage-listed.State Heritage Website Careel House is a bungalow made of stone that was quarried in the area. Nowadays it is on the Whale Beach side of the boundary. It is also heritage-listed.State Heritage Website Hy Brasil, located near Clareville, was built in 1936, but was originally known as The Gem. Later it was bought by Ted Herman, son of the painter Sali Herman, who changed the name, using the name of a mythical island west of Ireland. It is heritage-listed.State Heritage Website A sandstone cottage known as Wickham, designed by Walter Burley Griffin, was unfortunately demolished with council approval in 1994. Another significant development was the creation of Ruskin Rowe in 1950. This street was designed as an estate by the architect Harry Ruskin Rowe, son of the architect Thomas Rowe. Rowe created covenants to preserve the character of the estate, but they have been ignored to an extent over the years. Nevertheless, the estate is heritage-listed because of its historic significance, as well as its scientific significance in preserving the bushland environment of the area.State Heritage Website = Early subdivision plans = File:Avalon Beach Estate Plateau Rd, Park Reserve, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Beach Estate Plateau Rd, Park Reserve, 1921-1926 File:Avalon Beach Central Estate, Avalon Pde, Barrenjoey Rd, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Beach Central Estate, Avalon Pde, Barrenjoey Rd, 1921-1926 File:Avalon Beach Estates, Central Rd, Plateau Rd, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Beach Estates, Central Rd, Plateau Rd, 1921-1926 File:Avalon Sanctuary Estate, Park Ave, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Sanctuary Estate, Park Ave, 1921-1926 Heritage listings Avalon Beach has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 32 Plateau Road: Walter Burley Griffin Lodge * 111 Whale Beach Road: Loggan Rock Demographics According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 9,905 residents in Avalon Beach. 73.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 9.6%, New Zealand 2.0% and United States of America 1.1%. 90.2% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 43.0%, Catholic 19.4% and Anglican 18.6%.  Commercial areas  Avalon Beach features an RSL club, a surf club, bowling and sailing clubs; a golf club, a supermarket, shops, offices, cafes and a cinema. Cuisines include French, Vietnamese, Italian, Mexican, American Diner, Japanese, Thai and other Asian. There is a book shop, hairdresser, artisan bakery, petrol station, Red Cross Shop, bottle shop, many real estate agents, hardware store, florists and many homewares and dress shops. It is unique in that this large commercial centre is separated from the beach only by the road, a fact which until recently was used to argue against commercialisation of the beach side buildings themselves as restaurants and cafes were already so close to the beach.  Sport and recreation  Avalon Beach is a surfing beach and has a 25-metre salt water rock pool at the south end. Avalon Beach SLSC members patrol Avalon Beach. Several former surfing world champions are also past or current Avalon residents; including Ben Player. Avalon Soccer Club, established 1982, has over 80 teams and 1000 registered players. Avalon Junior Rugby League Club has contributed several players active in the Australian National Rugby League. Avalon also has a small nine-hole golf course. Pittwater Council has created the Bangalley Headland Walk, which goes through part of the Careel Headland Reserve. The track starts at Whale Beach Road and goes to Marine Parade. St Michaels Cave is an interesting coastal feature.  Schools  * Barrenjoey High School * Avalon Public School * Maria Regina Catholic Primary School * Montessori public school on the former grounds of Barrenjoey Highschool  Culture/politics  An episode of the American television show Baywatch was shot at Avalon Beach in the late 1990s. Producers of the show, seeking to relocate from their Californian base due to cost constraints, proposed a full relocation to Avalon and promised an upgrading of the SLSC in return, painting a huge sign saying \\"Avalon Beach\\" across the surf club. However, following complaints from residents (supported by former world surfing champion and local property owner Mark Warren), the series moved instead to Hawaii. The anti-Baywatch supporters were led by former Pittwater mayor Alex McTaggart, who was subsequently elected to NSW State Parliament for two years. In 2011-13 there was a move by the Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving club officials, led by Christine Hopton, to replace the existing surf club. The development went ahead despite opposition from local residents in the land and environment court.

The film is a melding of dark modern drama with idealised Chinese and Japanese cultural themes and settings, and centres on body painting. Plot The film's title, \\"The Pillow Book\\", refers to an ancient Japanese diary written by Sei Sh≈çnagon, actual name believed to be Kiyohara Nagiko, from whence the protagonist's name in the film. The film is narrated by Nagiko, a Japanese born model living in Hong Kong. Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto, when her father would write characters of good fortune on her face. Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt reads a list of \\"beautiful things\\" from Sei Sh≈çnagon's Pillow Book. Nagiko's aunt tells her that when she is twenty- eight years old, the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old, and that she, Nagiko, will be the same age as Sei Sh≈çnagon when she had written the book (in addition to sharing her first name). Nagiko also learns around this time that her father is in thrall to his publisher, \\"Yaji- san\\", who demands sexual favours from her father in exchange for publishing his work. =Early chapters= The publisher arranges Nagiko's wedding to his young apprentice. Her husband, an expert archer, resents Nagiko's love for books and her desire to read, in spite of his apprenticeship. He also refuses to indulge in her desires for pleasure, refusing to write on her body. When he discovers and reads Nagiko's pillow book, he is extremely resentful, setting it on fire and thus setting fire to their marital home, an event which Nagiko describes to be the 'first major fire of [her] life.' Insulted and enraged, Nagiko leaves him for good. Hiding from her husband, Nagiko moves to Hong Kong. In spite of her aversion to the practice, she learns how to type to find work. Outside her apartment, a group of activists regularly protest the publishing industry for the depletion of forests due to the need to make paper. After working as a secretary in the office of a Japanese fashion designer for a while, Nagiko's employer takes a liking to her and makes her one of his models. As a successful fashion model, Nagiko hires a maid, as she now finally has the opportunity to explore her sexual desires of being written on. However, after several affairs, she feels dissatisfied with them all: either they have great penmanship and are lousy lovers, or vice versa. One day, at the Cafe Typo, Nagiko's favourite haunt, she meets Jerome, a British translator. Intrigued by his knowledge, they go to a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages. In spite of her interest, Nagiko dislikes Jerome's handwriting and orders him out. Jerome totally shocks Nagiko, however, when he asks her to teach him, offering her to write on his body. Opening his shirt, he offers Nagiko to \\"Use my body like the pages of a book. Of your book!\\". Nagiko has never considered this aspect in her desires before: her lovers always write on her body. When she backs out and runs, Jerome laughs at her. Frightened but very intrigued by Jerome's suggestion, Nagiko has several one-night stands in which she experiments writing on their bodies. One of the activists, admirer Hoki, a Japanese photographer who adores her, begs Nagiko to take him as a lover. She explains she can't, as his skin's no good for writing: whenever she writes on him, the ink smears and runs. Hoki, not wanting Nagiko to keep carrying on like she is, suggests she try writing a book, offering to take it to a renowned publisher he freelances for. Nagiko likes this idea and writes her first book. Nagiko's book is returned, being told the book is \\"not worth the paper it's written on!\\". Insulted, Nagiko follows the address on the envelope to confront the publisher. Nagiko is shocked to discover that the publisher who rejected her work is in fact Yaji-san, her father's old publisher. What's more, the publisher has a young lover: Jerome. Devising a plan, Nagiko decides that she will get to the publisher through Jerome. Meeting up with Jerome again, Nagiko discovers he has learned a few more languages, and his penmanship has greatly improved. Nagiko and Jerome spend several weeks exploring this, writing on each other and making love. Nagiko soon realises that, in Jerome, she has found the perfect lover she has been searching for: the partner with whom she can share her physical and her poetic passion, using each other's bodies as tablets for their art. =Writing of books 1 ‚Äì 6= Nagiko tells Jerome the truth and the whole story with the publisher. Jerome comes up with an idea: Nagiko will write her book on Jerome's body and Jerome will take it to the publisher. Nagiko loves the idea, and writes Book 1: The Book of The Agenda, in intricate characters of black, red, and gold, on Jerome, keeping her identity anonymous. The plan is a success: Jerome sees the publisher and exhibits the book on his nude body, and the impressed publisher has his scriveners copy down the text. After telling Nagiko of the plan's success, Jerome tells Nagiko that he'll return to her as soon as the publisher, who was extremely aroused by the experience, lets him go. However, during his time with the publisher, Jerome appears to lose track of time and doesn't return to Nagiko. Nagiko, jealous, impatient, and angry, searches for Jerome, eventually finding him making love with the publisher. Nagiko takes this as rejection and betrayal of the worst kind, and immediately plots revenge. On two Swedish tourists, Nagiko writes Book 2: The Book of The Innocent and Book 3: The Book of the Idiot. Shortly afterwards, an old man is running naked through the streets from the publisher's shop, bearing Book 4: The Book of Impotence/Old Age. Book 5: The Book of the Exhibitionist is delivered by a boorish, fat, hyperactive American (Tom Kane; who was actually more interested in Hoki than Nagiko). Nagiko's revenge is a success. Jerome is furiously jealous, and comes to Nagiko's home to confront her. Nagiko refuses to meet him, however, and won't let Jerome in. Jerome's outrage soon turns to desperation as he begs her to talk to him, but she won't. Jerome sinks into deep depression and meets with Hoki at the Cafe Typo, desperate to find a way to get Nagiko to forgive him. Hoki suggests that he \\"scare\\" Nagiko by faking suicide, similar to the fake death scene in Romeo and Juliet and gives Jerome some pills. Arriving at Nagiko's home while she is away, Jerome takes some of the pills, then writes a page, as if writing a book. Each time he takes some pills, he writes another page, keeping track of how many pills he takes on each page. As the pills take effect, Jerome can write no more and lies on the bed, naked, holding a copy of Sei Sh≈çnagon's the book of observations. The plan is a success: when Nagiko returns home and finds Jerome, she rushes to him, eager to renew their relationship and continue their plans. However, the plan has worked too well: Jerome has overdosed on the pills and is dead. Nagiko is devastated, and realises how much she loved him. On his dead body, Nagiko writes Book 6: The Book of the Lovers. At Jerome's funeral, his mother, a snobbish, upper-class woman, tells Nagiko that Jerome always loved things that were \\"fashionable\\". When she suggests that was probably why Jerome loved Nagiko, Nagiko strikes her. Nagiko burns her possessions and moves back to Japan. After the funeral, the publisher secretly exhumes Jerome's body from the tomb and has Jerome's skin, still bearing the writing, flayed and made into a grotesque pillow book of his own. Nagiko learns of the publisher's actions and becomes distraught and outraged. She sends a letter to the publisher, still keeping her identity a secret, demanding that particular book from the publisher's hands in exchange for the remaining books. The publisher, now obsessed with his mysterious writer and her work, agrees. =Writing of books 7 ‚Äì 13= Nagiko, now pregnant with Jerome's child, writes Book 7: The Book of The Seducer on a male messenger. The writing on him is almost destroyed and undecipherable when the publisher accidentally leaves the messenger out in the rain. Book 8: The Book of Youth is delivered as a series of photographs. A young Buddhist monk then arrives bearing Book 9: The Book of Secrets written on all his \\"secret\\" spots: in between his fingers and toes, the insides of his thighs, etc.; the book is presented in the form of riddles. When the next messenger arrives, he is completely bare: no writing at all. The publisher and staff search for any hint of writing on the messenger's naked body. As the publisher dismisses him as a hoax, the man sticks out his tongue, bearing Book 10: The Book of Silence. The activists' protests come to an end when their truck hits a young wrestler bearing Book 11: The Book of The Betrayed, right outside the publisher's office. The next messenger (Masaru Matsuda) simply drives by the office, giving little time to copy down Book 12: The Book of False Starts. Finally, Book 13: The Book of the Dead arrives on the body of a Sumo wrestler. In the book writing on the body of the messenger, which the publisher carefully reads, Nagiko finally reveals her identity, confronting the publisher with his crimes: blackmailing and disgracing her father, \\"corrupting\\" her husband, as well as Jerome, and what he's done to Jerome's corpse. The publisher, greatly shamed and humbled by being confronted with his guilt, hands the pillow book made of Jerome's skin to the messenger, then has the messenger slit his throat. Upon recovering the book made out of Jerome's skin, Nagiko buries it under a Bonsai tree and life goes on. She has given birth to Jerome's child, and is shown in the epilogue writing on her child's face, like her father used to do when she was young, and quoting from her own pillow book. It is now Nagiko's 28th birthday. Nagiko's bi-cultural heritage plays a key role in this film. As a half-Chinese and half-Japanese woman, Nagiko navigates her dual cultures through physical and psychological exploration. Greenaway portrays this exploration subtly by mixing and switching Asian iconography.

The novel is a report of Ijon Tichy's travel to a faraway planet Entia (in Polish text: Encja) to study their civilization. This report was supposed to fix a misunderstanding arisen from Tichy's Fourteenth Voyage to supposedly Entia (then known as Enteropia), which turned out to be a satellite of Entia, masqueraded by Entians to misguide explorers. The travel was also to verify the results of the \\"Institute of Historiographical Computers\\" (Polish: Instytut Maszyn Dziejowych), which use predictive modeling to overcome the speed of light limitation and get information about the state of the affairs on remote planets based on information obtained from previous expeditions. Major themes of the book are: the problems of the society of abundance based entirely on automated production where individuals have little to do; imposition of ethical laws through technology i.e. the \\"ethicsphere\\" which has made it impossible to harm individuals physically; and the ideological opposition of two dominant systems, which is basically a parody of Western World-Soviet Union split taken to the absurd. The original novel was first printed by Wydawnictwo Literackie in 1982. It was translated into German by Hubert Schumann under the title Lokaltermin in 1987 (). Lacking English translation, the novel title was also translated in literary criticism works as \\"Eyewitness Account\\" and \\"The Scene of the Crime\\". Science Fiction Studies published a collection of excerpts from Lem's letters which show the chronology of the creation of the novel (during 1979-1981). In the first one Lem confesses that he tried to approach the subject several times in the past few years. \\"On the Genesis of Wizja Lokalna\\" in: Science Fiction Studies #40 = Volume 13, Part 3 = November 1986, Article Abstracts Also, in his essay The Philosophy of Chance Lem confesses that he struggled with the novel for many years. Plot summary Tichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from \\"kurdl\\") and Luzania. These names require some explanations. Kurdl is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia. The name of the animal is Lem's invention, used in earlier tales about Tichy. (In Polish it is kurdel, however in declensions of the word the root converts into \\"kurdl-\\", hence there are no associations with the English word \\"curdle\\"). Michael Kandel translated it as \\"squamp\\" in his translation of Tichy's 14th voyage. The name \\"Luzania\\" derives from the Polish root \\"luz-\\" with the meaning of \\"loose\\", \\"not restrained\\"; the choice will become clear below. Kurdlandia's guiding ideology is \\"national mobilism\\", that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the stomachs, various passages and internal organs of the kurdls. Kurdls walk about the marshes, guided by drivers, and their inhabitants hence are \\"able to explore the land of their wonderful country from inside of their home kurdl\\", in the words of a patriotic individual that Ijon Tichy spoke to. Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year). Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes, on dry ground, in normal houses. Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it. The other state, Luzania, constitutes a treatment of the topic of an \\"ideal state\\". Luzanian's most prominent accomplishment is the creation of \\"ethicsphere\\" (compare \\"atmosphere\\"). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called \\"bystry\\" (\\"quickies\\" in English) that serve to control matter in the 'quickated' areas. The primary function of the 'quickies' is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word \\"ethicsphere\\"). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the 'quickies' would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet. The 'quickies' also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living. Hence, there is not much of an economic life going on, although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs. Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits, such as being professors, students, and government officials, but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent. Apparently the 'quickies' are capable of some collective thought, at least for the purposes of self-replication and self-improvement, as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat, no doubt). The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that 'quickies' can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally, many of them are members of the protest movement. There exists ideological opposition between Kurdlandia and Luzania. Generally speaking, many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border. On the other hand, many Luzanians, especially university students and faculty, dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the 'quickies' and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl-ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the 'quickies', depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual. Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the 'quickies' areas. The main character spends most of his time in Luzania, studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system. We learn about it through his words.

Broken Bay is the first major bay north of Sydney Harbour. Broken Bay has its origin at the confluence of the Hawkesbury River, Pittwater, and Brisbane Water and flows openly into the Tasman Sea. The total surface area of the bay is approximately .  Geography  The entrance to Broken Bay lies between the northern Box Head and Barrenjoey Head to the south. Barrenjoey Lighthouse was constructed in 1881 to guide ships away from the prominent headland. The bay comprises three arms, being the prominent estuary of the Hawkesbury River in the west, Pittwater to the south, and Brisbane Water to the north. These three arms are flooded rivers (rias) formed at a time when the sea level was much lower than it is at the present day. The Hawkesbury River flows from the confluence of the Grose and Nepean Rivers at the base of the Blue Mountains. Pittwater extends south from Broken Bay and is the northernmost extent of the greater Sydney area. Pittwater's calm waters make it a popular sailing area. West Head, west of Barrenjoey Head, marks the divide between Pittwater and the Hawkesbury. Brisbane Water is the northern arm of Broken Bay and has the towns of Gosford and Woy Woy on its shores. Lion Island, named for its profile's resemblance to a Sphinx from some viewpoints, is located at the entrance of Broken Bay. Lion Island Nature Reserve covers the entire island, and is home to a colony of fairy penguins.  European discovery  James Cook recorded \\"broken land\\" seen north of Port Jackson just before sunset on 7 wMay 1770, and named it Broken Bay. However, there has been some controversy over whether what is now known as 'Broken Bay' was what was sighted by Cook. :Matthew Flinders, llopllThe colonists have called this place Broken Bay, but it is not what was so named by Captain Cook. Ray Parkin in his book H. M. Bark Endeavour claims that the modern 'Broken Bay' was passed unremarked at night, and that Cook was in fact referring to the area around Narrabeen Lagoon. Matthew Flinders placed Cook's 'Broken Bay' at 33¬∞ 42' South, near to the mouth of Narrabeen Lagoon.A Voyage to Terra Australia, Vol Two page 2 (22 July 1802) Whatever the case, Governor Phillip was the first to examine the present day Broken Bay in a longboat from the Sirius on 2 March 1788.The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay with an account of the Establishment of the Colonies of Port Jackson etc etc London 1789 page 9--~~~~  Role in attack on Sydney Harbour  On 28 November 2005, documentary film-maker Damien Lay claimed that the wreckage of M-24, a Japanese midget submarine involved in the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942 and disappeared soon afterward, was buried under sand on the seabed, just east of Lion Island. Lay claimed to have confirmed that copper wiring found at the site was consistent with that used in similar Japanese vessels. A few weeks later, New South Wales Planning Minister Frank Sartor announced that sonar scans conducted by the New South Wales Heritage Office at the location specified had found no trace of the lost submarine. M-24 was eventually found approximately 13 kilometres south of Broken Bay, 5 kilometres off Bungan Head, proving the hypothesis that M-24 chose to not draw attention to its mother submarines to the south of Sydney Harbour and instead moved north towards Broken Bay.

Brisbane Water has its origin at the confluence of the Narara and Coorumbine Creeks, to the south‚Äìeast of Gosford and travels for approximately in a southerly direction to its mouth at Broken Bay, about from the Tasman Sea, at Barrenjoey Head. A number of towns and suburbs surround the shores of Brisbane Water, including Blackwall, Booker Bay, Davistown, Empire Bay, Erina, Ettalong Beach, Gosford, Green Point, Hardys Bay, Kilcare, Kincumber, Koolewong, Phegans Bay, Point Frederick, Point Clare, Saratoga, Tascott, Wagstaffe, and Woy Woy. Contained within Brisbane Water is St Huberts Island, Rileys Island, and Pelican Island; and adjoining the estuary is Brisbane Water National Park to the west and Bouddi National Park to the east. Forming part of the same tidal estuary system is a separate but connected basin, the Kincumber Broadwater, lying to the east of Davistown. The total catchment area of the river is approximately . The land adjacent to the Brisbane Water was occupied for many thousands of years by Australian Aboriginal peoples, the Darkinjung and Kuringgai, who used the estuary and foreshore areas for cultural purposes. Brisbane Water was named in 1825 in honour of Sir Thomas Brisbane, a Governor of New South Wales, serving between 1820 and 1825.  History  Brisbane Water is part of the traditional lands of the Darkinjung and Kuringgai aboriginal peoples. Places of significance to Aboriginal people located in the area surrounding Brisbane Water that are listed on the Register of the National Estate include Daleys Point area and Staples Lookout, west of Woy Woy. Initial colonial explorers of the area were assisted by Bungaree, a leader of the Kuringgai tribe who went on to assist Phillip Parker King and Matthew Flinders in the circumnavigation of Australia. Twentieth century European settlement led to the development of an extensive local ferry network, including one supplying an otherwise isolated orphanage, a commuter service from Gosford to Woy Woy and a third operation dedicated to carrying farm produce. The last commuter ferries between Brisbane Water townships ceased in 1971. The only ferry service to exist now services the communities of Empire Bay, Davistown, Saratoga and Woy Woy and is operated by Central Coast Ferries. In 1973, local residents on Rileys Island requested a green ban after a development company intended to remove all native vegetation to make way for construction on the island. Environment The Brisbane Water estuary and foreshores have particularly high scenic value and include areas of pristine vegetation and extensive views of the water from a number of locations. Beaches, inlets and bays can be distinguished in the foreground with inherent juxtaposition of bushland- covered hills in the distance. Access to existing key vantage points allows for the public to experience the landscape character of the Brisbane Water estuary and its surrounds. With the approximate average bed level at and often as low as , Brisbane Water is considered mostly shallow, with a tidal impact of ¬±. The inlet narrows at a point known as The Rip, located adjacent to Ettalong Beach. The Rip has a rapid tidal current. The oyster industry is an important part of the local economy. In terms of Sydney rock oyster production, in 2007/2008 a total of ~250,000 dozens of oysters were produced in the Brisbane Water estuary, with a total value of 1.3 million representing approximately 3.6% of the NSW industry total for 2007/2008. During 2009, over 110 bird species were recorded within the estuary; with sixty vulnerable and fourteen endangered animal species, and sixteen vulnerable and eight endangered plant species. Some of Brisbane Water is classified by BirdLife International as an important bird area because it has an isolated population of up to ten breeding pairs of bush stone-curlews and sometimes supports flocks of the endangered regent honeyeater and swift parrot during autumn and winter, when the swamp mahogany trees are in flower.

The novel describes, in a satirical tone, the ultimate implications of the arms race. It is a continuation of the adventures of Ijon Tichy.About the novel on Lem's official website  Plot summary The evolution of artificial intelligence has allowed major world powers to sign a rather curious treaty: the Moon is divided into national zones (proportional to each nation's Earth real estate) and all weapons development and production must be moved there to be handled by factories. This is supposed to completely demilitarize Earth, achieving the long-sought dream of world peace. A MAD stabilizing factor is apparently preserved by the ability of countries, in case of war, to quickly ship weapons down from the Moon. Unknown to most people, a problem arises. The ever-increasing amount of autonomy given to Moon's automata, in order to conduct more-effective espionage in neighbors' nation facilities and also to defend one's own, leads to localized robotic conflicts on the Moon's surface. Eventually, after a number of events, there is a total discontinuation of any communication with the Moon. After a number of failed expeditions to reveal the truth on what is going on beneath the Moon's surface, Ijon Tichy is called to the rescue.Review at challengingdestiny.com Right before the return he was hit by a laser weapon which has led to his callosotomy. The resulting split personality leads to his inability to communicate properly both with the people and between the two \\"alter egos\\". This results in a good deal of slapstick comedy, e.g., involving hilarious conflicts between Tichy's left and right hand or leg. With the help of his friend, professor Tarantoga, he eventually succeeds in talking to himself. Another consequence of Tichy's visit is that he accidentally brings to the Earth particles of mysterious moon dust, which turns out to be the result of military-robotic \\"necroevolution\\", described in Lem's novel The Invincible and which brings a quiet devastation of the whole Earth's technological infrastructure and information stored in it.

Stanton (AP-69) was the lead ship of her class of Second World War United States Navy transport ships, named for the suffragist and abolitionist Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Elizabeth C. Stanton was launched on 22 December 1939 as Sea Star by Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. Richard J. Welch; renamed Mormacstar in 1940; transferred to the Navy on 13 September 1942; and commissioned on 17 September 1942, Commander D. A. Frost, USN (Ret), in command. Service history Sailing from Norfolk on 24 October 1942, Elizabeth C. Stanton quickly landed her troops and equipment for the assault on North Africa on 8 November and got underway for the States within the week. After another rapid voyage to North Africa to support the troops fighting ashore, she returned to Norfolk on 24 April 1943 and the following day became flagship for amphibious exercises in Chesapeake Bay. On 10 May 1943 Elizabeth C. Stanton sailed again for the Mediterranean, where she saw action during the invasion of Sicily on 10 July. She remained off the island discharging troops and combat cargo, and fighting off enemy aircraft for six days. She returned to Algeria to prepare for the next operation, and on 9 September landed her troops at Salerno in the initial assault. Until the end of October, she carried reinforcement troops from Bizerte and Oran to Naples for the capture and occupation of Italy, then sailed for New York and overhaul. When Elizabeth C. Stanton returned to transport duty in January 1944, preparations were underway for the June invasion of Normandy; she made two voyages to carry troops and cargo for the huge buildup in the British Isles. On 14 March 1944 she departed Belfast for Algeria, and subsequently carried troops to Naples, taking part in amphibious exercises and antisubmarine patrols until August. Then she saw action in the initial landings on the coast of southern France. She continued to support this operation by transporting troops and cargo throughout the Mediterranean until returning to the United States on 8 November. After overhaul at New York, Elizabeth C. Stanton sailed for the Pacific on 4 January 1945, and arrived at Espiritu Santo on 23 February. Assigned to redeploy troops in the central and southern Pacific, she sailed from Pearl Harbor to the New Hebrides, Marianas, Marshalls, Solomons, Carolines and Okinawa Gunto. Arriving at San Francisco on 11 July for repairs, she sailed again in August to transport troops for the occupation of Japan. She returned to the West Coast late in 1945. On 20 January 1946 she carried 1,800 German prisoners of war with their US Army guards from Long Beach to Liverpool and Le Havre. She returned to New York on 5 March and was decommissioned on 3 April 1946, ownership reverting to the Maritime Commission on the same day. Elizabeth C. Stanton received five battle stars for World War II service. Return to commerce On 24 August 1946 the ship was returned to Moore McCormack Lines for operation until sold to Peninsular Navigation Co. on 14 February 1961 to be renamed Jacqueline Someck. The ship was sold back to Moore McCormack on 18 December 1963 to be sold again on 28 February 1964 to Windward Steamship Co. to be renamed National Seafarer. The ship was sold to interest in Japan and scrapped September 1967.

Starring Erland Josephson, it centers on a middle-aged intellectual who attempts to bargain with God to stop an impending nuclear holocaust. The Sacrifice was Tarkovsky's third film as a Soviet expatriate, after Nostalghia and the documentary Voyage in Time, and was also his last, as he died shortly after its completion. Like 1972's Solaris, it won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film opens on the birthday of Alexander (Erland Josephson), an actor who gave up the stage to work as a journalist, critic and lecturer on aesthetics. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa Franz√©n), and young son, \\"Little Man\\", who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the seaside, when Alexander's friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him. When Otto asks, Alexander mentions that his relationship with God is \\"nonexistent\\". After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive at the scene and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car. However, Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, Alexander first recounts how he and Adelaide found this lovely house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with the house and surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of \\"the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology\\"; in fact, he has \\"grown to hate the emptiness of human speech\\". The family, as well as Victor and Otto, gather at Alexander's house for the celebration. Their maid Maria leaves, while nurse-maid Julia stays to help with the dinner. People comment on Maria's odd appearances and behavior. The guests chat inside the house, where Otto reveals that he is a student of paranormal phenomena, a collector of \\"inexplicable but true incidences.\\" Just when the dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, as Alexander enters, a news program announces the beginning of what appears to be all-out war, and possibly nuclear holocaust. His wife has a complete nervous breakdown. In despair, he vows to God to sacrifice all he loves, even Little Man, if this may be undone. Otto advises him to slip away and lie with Maria, who Otto convinces him is a witch, \\"in the best possible sense\\". Alexander takes his gun, leaves a note in his room, escapes the house, and rides his bike to where she is staying. She is bewildered when he makes his advances, but when he puts his gun to his temple (\\"Don't kill us, Maria\\"), at which point the jet-fighters' rumblings return, she soothes him and they consummate while floating above her bed, though Alexander's reaction is ambiguous. When he awakes the next morning, in his own bed, everything seems normal. Nevertheless, Alexander sets forth to give up all he loves and possesses. He tricks the family members and friends into going for a walk, and sets fire to their house when they are away. As the group rushes back, alarmed by the fire, Alexander confesses that he set the fire himself, and furiously runs around. Maria, who until then was not seen that morning, appears in the fire scene; Alexander tries to approach her, but is restrained by others. Without explanation, an ambulance appears in the area, and two paramedics chase Alexander, who appears to have lost control of himself, and drive off with him. Maria begins to bicycle away, but stops halfway to observe Little Man watering the tree he and Alexander planted the day before. As Maria leaves the scene, the \\"mute\\" Little Man, lying at the foot of the tree, speaks his only line, which quotes the opening Gospel of John: \\"In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?\\" Cast * Erland Josephson as Alexander * Susan Fleetwood as Adelaide * Allan Edwall as Otto * Gu√∞r√∫n G√≠slad√≥ttir as Maria * Sven Wollter as Victor * Val√©rie Mairesse as Julia * Filippa Franz√©n as Marta * Tommy Kjellqvist as Gossen (Little Man) * Per K√§llman, Tommy Nordahl as ambulance drivers Production =Pre-production= The Sacrifice originated as a screenplay entitled The Witch, which preserved the element of a middle- aged protagonist spending the night with a reputed witch. However, in this story, his cancer was miraculously cured, and he ran away with the woman. In March 1982, Tarkovsky wrote in his journal that he considered this ending \\"weak\\", as the happy ending was unchallenged. He wanted personal favorite and frequent collaborator Anatoly Solonitsyn to star in this picture, as was also his intention for Nostalghia, but when Solonitsyn died from cancer in 1982, the director rewrote the screenplay into what would become The Sacrifice and also filmed Nostalghia with Oleg Yankovsky as the lead. Tarkovsky considered The Sacrifice different from his earlier films because, while he commented that his recent films had been \\"impressionistic in structure\\", in this case he not only \\"aimed...to develop [its] episodes in the light of my own experience and of the rules of dramatic structure\\", but also to \\"[build] the picture into a poetic whole in which all the episodes were harmoniously linked\\", and that because of this, it \\"took on the form of a poetic parable\\". At the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, Tarkovsky was invited to film in Sweden, as he was a long-time friend of Anna-Lena Wibom of the Swedish Film Institute. He decided to film The Sacrifice with Erland Josephson, who was best known for his work with Ingmar Bergman, and whom Tarkovsky had directed in Nostalghia. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist, a friend of Josephson and frequent collaborator with Ingmar Bergman, was asked to join the production. Despite a contemporaneous offer to shoot Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa, Nykvist later said that it was \\"not a difficult choice\\", and like Josephson, he became a co-producer when he invested his fees back into the film. Production designer Anna Asp, who worked on Bergman's Autumn Sonata and After the Rehearsal, and had won an Academy Award alongside Susanne Lingheim for Fanny and Alexander, also joined the project, as well as Daniel Bergman, one of Ingmar's children, who worked as a camera assistant. Many critics would comment on The Sacrifice in the context of Bergman's work. =Filming= While often erroneously claimed to have been shot on F√•r√∂, The Sacrifice was actually filmed at N√§rsholmen on the nearby island of Gotland; the Swedish military denied Tarkovsky access to F√•r√∂. Alexander's house, specially built for the production, was to be burned for the climactic scene, in which Alexander burns his house and his possessions. The shot was very difficult to achieve, and the first failed attempt was, according to Tarkovsky, the only problem during shooting. Despite Sven Nykvist's protest, only one camera was used for this scene, and while shooting the burning house, the camera jammed and the footage was thus ruined. The scene had to be reshot, requiring a quick and very costly reconstruction of the house in two weeks. This time, two cameras were set up on tracks, running parallel to each other. The footage in the final version of the film is the second take, which lasts for six minutes (and ends abruptly because the camera had run through an entire reel). The cast and crew broke down in tears after the take was completed.Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Dir. Michal Leszczylowski. Perf. Brian Cox, Erland Josephson and Andrey Tarkovskiy. Svenska Filminstitutet (SFI), 1988. =Post-production= Tarkovsky and Nykvist performed significant amounts of color reduction on select scenes. According to Nykvist, almost sixty percent of the color was removed from these parts. Reception The film won Tarkovsky his second Grand Prix, after Solaris, his fourth FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival, and his third Palme D'Or nomination. The Sacrifice also won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. At the 22nd Guldbagge Awards, the film won the awards for Best Film and Best Actor (Erland Josephson). In 1988, it won the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Since the 1980s, reviewers have been responding positively to the film; the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 86%, based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 7.58/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Formally impressive, visually accomplished, and narratively rewarding, The Sacrifice places a fittingly solid capstone on a brilliant filmmaking career\\". In 1995, the Vatican compiled a list of 45 'great films', separated into the categories of \\"Religion\\", \\"Values\\", and \\"Art\\", to recognize the centennial of cinema. The Sacrifice was included under the first category, as well as Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev. However, critics have commented on The Sacrifice's religious ambiguities. Dennis Lim points out that it is \\"not exactly a simple allegory of Christian atonement and self-sacrifice\\". Catholic film critic Steven Greydanus contrasts the film's \\"dialectic of Christian and pagan ideas\\" with Andrei Rublev, writing that, while Rublev \\"[rejects] the advances of an alluring pagan witch as incompatible with Christian love\\", The Sacrifice \\"juxtaposes\\" both sensibilities.

The town is located on the edge of an elevated plateau (the Illawarra escarpment) about from the coast. At the , Robertson and its surrounding area had a population of 1,865. Robertson is known for its high annual rainfall and fertile soil. It was previously covered by an extensive temperate rainforest, most of which has been cleared for farming though remnants such as Robertson Nature Reserve still exist today. The town is colloquially known as \\"Robbo\\" by the locals. The town is surrounded by lush pasture used for beef and dairy production. It was once famous for cheese production; its distance from, and poor transport to, the Sydney markets meant that in the early days fresh milk was not a viable industry and so the key dairy industries were butter and cheese. Today, the remnants of the cheese industry are seen with one of the old cheese factories remaining in the town; it has been converted into a commercial row of shops. There is also the remnants of an old butter factory at the western end of town. Robertson is now more widely known for potato growing and is the home of the \\"Big Potato\\". The Big Potato was built in the 1970s by a local potato grower. Robertson is also where the 1995 movie Babe was filmed. History Robertson is named after former Premier of New South Wales Sir John Robertson, whose 1861 Land Act cleared the way for the establishment of the town.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13117116 Before then it was called Yarrawa Bush. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,865 people in Robertson. 76.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.6%. 89.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.9%, Anglican 25.2% and Catholic 17.2%. Events Aerial photo with street names. The Big Potato In February or March of each year the Robertson Show is held, featuring \\"The Great Australian Potato Race\\". In spring Robertson holds a spring festival, with local gardens open to the public.  Attractions  =Robertson Hotel= Robertson is home to the \\"Robertson Hotel\\", a popular hotel and wedding venue. The hotel was originally built in 1924, opening as Hotel Robertson. It had a nine-hole golf course, two tennis courts, croquet, lawn bowls, billiards, fishing, hunting, horse riding, and an onsite mechanic who looked after guests' cars during their stay. The hotel won the \\"Most luxurious hotel in the Commonwealth\\" award in 1925, and was the first hotel in Australia to have phone lines to every room. The hotel was built to draw some of the Sydneysiders, who in the past retreated to the cool climate of the Southern Highlands to escape the heat of a Sydney summer and enjoy the beauty of the countryside. It was a success and the developer went on to subdivide and develop the local area, less successfully. In 1930 the hotel was sold and marketed as an exclusive country club and renamed Ranelagh Country Club after Ranelagh Gardens in London. However, the Great Depression made those plans short lived. In the buildup to World War II the hotel became a WAAAF training base,https://www.ozatwar.com/locations/no2waaafdepot.htm serving as a signals base and a training area for budding pilots. After World War II, the hotel was used as a hospice for returned pilots. The building sold again in 1947 and became St Anthony's College, a Franciscan friary and seminary; it was also used as a school and accommodation house run by the monks. It was during this period that the stained glass windows, rock walls and fountains were built. These are still in the building and around the gardens and grounds. The hotel has its own railway platform, Moss Vale ‚Äì Unanderra line, which is still used today. In 1972 the monks moved to smaller premises in Campbelltown and the building returned to its original use as a hotel, named Ranelagh House. The hotel was sold again in late 2007, and was renamed Fountaindale Grand Manor and Ranelagh Gardens, undergoing major renovations and refurbishments. Recently it was renamed to Robertson Hotel.http://www.fountaindale.com.au/ Fountaindale Grand Manor =Illawarra Fly= On 15 March 2008, the Illawarra Fly Tree Top Walk opened to the public. It is similar to the Otway Fly, in Victoria. It is perched on the Illawarra escarpment at Knights Hill, located east of Robertson. The tree top walk is joined with an observation outdoor tower with views of Wollongong. It is expected to have approximately 200,000 visitors every year. =The Big Potato= The pranksters posing with the Big Potato Face, an overnight guerilla art installation, in March 2010. Built in 1977 by local potato grower Jim Mauger, the Big Potato sits off the Illawarra Highway. It was modelled on the Sebago potato and is approximately ten metres long and four metres wide. The structure was originally meant to house a Potato Information Centre but rising costs proved an obstacle. Recently the locals of Robertson have worked together to turn the surrounding land into a park.  Transport  Aerial photo from north west Robertson was served by a railway station on the Unanderra‚ÄìMoss Vale railway line. The railway line is mainly used for freight. East Coast Heritage Rail operates its Cockatoo Run train on a monthly basis across the line from Sydney to Moss Vale and return (via Wollongong). Other heritage trains sometimes use the line, however no regular passenger services are present on the line. CountryLink buses travel along the Illawarra Highway, linking the Southern Highlands to Wollongong. The Illawarra Highway winds down the escarpment via the Macquarie Pass.

Small quantities of sulfur, iron and cobalt are usually present, and sometimes the arsenic is largely replaced by antimony. This last forms an isomorphous series with breithauptite (nickel antimonide).  Etymology and history  When, in the medieval German Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, a red mineral resembling copper-ore was found, the miners looking for copper could extract none from it, as it contains none; worse yet, the ore also sickened them. They blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick) for besetting the copper (German: Kupfer).Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary, p888, W&R; Chambers Ltd, 1977. This German equivalent of \\"copper-nickel\\" was used as early as 1694 (other old German synonyms are Rotnickelkies and Arsennickel). In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was attempting to extract copper from kupfernickel mineral, and obtained instead a white metal that he called after the spirit, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel and Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy Cupronickel. The names subsequently given to the ore, nickeline from F. S. Beudant, 1832, and niccolite, from J. D. Dana, 1868, refer to the presence of nickel; in Latin, niccolum. In 1971, the International Mineralogical Association recommended use of the name nickeline rather than niccolite. Preparation of NiAs The main compound within nickeline, nickel arsenide (NiAs), can be prepared by direct combination of the elements: Ni(s) + As(s) ‚Üí NiAs(s)  Occurrence  Nickeline is formed by hydrothermal modification of ultramafic rocks and associated ore deposits, and may be formed by replacement of nickel-copper bearing sulfides (replacing pentlandite, and in association with copper arsenic sulfides), or via metasomatism of sulfide-free ultramafic rocks, where metasomatic fluids introduce sulfur, carbonate, and arsenic. This typically results in mineral assemblaged including millerite, heazelwoodite and metamorphic pentlandite-pyrite via sulfidation and associated arsenopyrite-nickeline-breithauptite. Associated minerals include: arsenopyrite, barite, silver, cobaltite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, breithauptite and maucherite. Nickeline alters to annabergite (a coating of green nickel arsenate) on exposure to moist air. Most of these minerals can be found in the areas surrounding Sudbury and Cobalt, Ontario. Other localities include the eastern flank of the Widgiemooltha Dome, Western Australia, from altered pentlndite-pyrite-pyrrhotite assemblages within the Mariners, Redross and Miitel nickel mines where nickeline is produced by regional Au-As-Ag-bearing alteration and carbonate metasomatism. Other occurrences include within similarly modified nickel mines of the Kambalda area.  Crystal structure  The unit cell of nickeline is used as the prototype of a class of solids with similar crystal structures. It consists of arsenic atoms in a distorted hexagonal close-packed structure with nickel atoms in \\"octahedral\\" sites, which in NiAs have distorted to become trigonal prismatic.Inorganic Chemistry by Duward Shriver and Peter Atkins, 3rd Edition, W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999, pp.47,48. Compounds adopting the NiAs structure are generally the chalcogenides, arsenides, antimonides and bismuthides of transition metals. The unit cell of nickeline The following are the members of the nickeline group: *Achavalite: FeSe *Breithauptite: NiSb *Freboldite: CoSe *Kotulskite: Pd(Te,Bi) *Langistite: (Co,Ni)As *Nickeline: NiAs *Sobolevskite: Pd(Bi,Te) *Sudburyite: (Pd,Ni)Sb  Economic importance  Nickeline is rarely used as a source of nickel due to the presence of arsenic, which is deleterious to most smelting and milling techniques. When nickel sulfide ore deposits have been altered to produce nickeline, often the presence of arsenic renders the ore uneconomic when concentrations of As reach several hundred parts per million. However, arsenic bearing nickel ore may be treated by blending with 'clean' ore sources, to produce a blended feedstock which the mill and smelter can handle with acceptable recovery. The primary problem for treating nickeline in conventionally constructed nickel mills is the specific gravity of nickeline versus that of pentlandite. This renders the ore difficult to treat via the froth flotation technique. Within the smelter itself, the nickeline contributes to high arsenic contents which require additional reagents and fluxes to strip from the nickel metal.

They are located at the outer edge of Buzzards Bay, north of Martha's Vineyard, from which they are separated by Vineyard Sound, and constitute the town of Gosnold in Dukes County, Massachusetts. History Satellite image of Elizabeth Islands and Martha's Vineyard In 1602 the islands were first discovered by Europeans when the English explorer and colonialist Bartholomew Gosnold sighted them on his way to Virginia. However it was not until 1641, subsequent to the successful establishment of the first English North American colonies, that colonialists formally laid claim and settled the islands in the name of the English Crown as part of the country's nascent imperial expansion. At this time they renamed the islands after Elizabeth I, who had been Queen of England when the islands had first been discovered.\\"Visiting the Elizabeth Islands,\\" North American Review; vol. 5 (15); (September 1817), pp. 313-324; accessed July 7, 2009 In 1641, Thomas Mayhew the Elder, of Watertown, Massachusetts, bought the islands‚Äîalong with Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard‚Äîfrom William Alexander, the Earl of Stirling. Before the creation of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, the islands were part of the extinct Dukes County, New York. The first known European inhabitant was Francis Usselton, who had been banished at the time for making secret trades with the local Indians without consent from the governor. Geography and demographics The total land area of the islands is 34.55 km¬≤ (13.34 sq mi); and there was a permanent population of 75 persons as of the 2010 census, making it the smallest town in Massachusetts. = Named islands = Stretching south-west from land's end at Falmouth, Massachusetts, the islands are: *Nonamesset Island, the closest to the mainland *Veckatimest, a small island. *Gull Island, a small uninhabited island. *Uncatena Island, uninhabited as of the 2000 Census *Naushon Island, long and the largest. Composed of the main island along with the smaller Nonamesset, Monohansett, Bull, Cedar, and Bachelor islands. Owned by the Forbes' Naushon Island Trust, and while it is not generally open to the public, the Forbes family has set aside Tarpaulin Cove to the south and Kettle Cove to the north as well as Bull Island and Hadley Harbor to the northeast for public enjoyment including picknicking. *The Weepecket Islands, three small, publicly accessible islands north of central Naushon owned by the Forbes family. These islands offer very few places to land, are nearly obscured by water, and are home to numerous shore birds, seals and other animals. *Pasque Island, long, owned by a subset of the Forbes family, and covered in poison ivy. A shallow tidal creek cuts part way through the island. *Nashawena Island, long, owned by another subset of the Forbes family, it has grazing livestock. *Baret Island, located off the north shore of Nashawena Island. *Rock Island, located off the north shore of Nashawena Island. *Penikese Island, located about north of Nashawena and Cuttyhunk. Penikese is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has a colorful history. It was the site of a groundbreaking 19th-century research facility that was the precursor to the famed Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, was the site of the state's only leper colony in the early 20th century, and is currently a bird sanctuary and site of the Penikese Island School, a 35-year- old school for troubled teens. *Cuttyhunk Island, farthest west in the chain, and home to most of Gosnold's municipal population. Like Penikese, Cuttyhunk is not owned by the Forbes family, and therefore much of the island is publicly accessible. *Gosnold Island, located in Westend Pond on Cuttyhunk Island. = Named channels = Channels with strong tidal currents, known locally as holes, separate the islands from each other and the mainland. Currents of up to are driven by the different sizes and filling rates of Vineyard Sound to the southeast and Buzzards Bay to the northwest. At high tide, water flows from Buzzards Bay to the Vineyard Sound. Near mid-tide the water stops and reverses, filling the Bay at low tide. Listed from northeast to southwest, the named channels are: *Woods Hole separating the mainland from Nonamesset Island *Robinson's Hole between Naushon Island and Pasque Island *Quick's Hole between Pasque Island and Nashawena Island *Canapitsit Channel between Nashawena Island and Cuttyhunk Island. = Named harbors and coves = *Cuttyhunk Harbor is sheltered on its east by Nashawena Island on its west by Cuttyhunk Island and on its north by Penikese Island. *Tarpaulin Cove on the south shore of Naushon Island.

It was led by Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of the state of Shu Han, against opposing forces in the Nanzhong region (covering parts of present-day Yunnan, Guizhou and southern Sichuan). The campaign was a response to rebellions started by local governors in the Nanzhong region and intrusions by the Nanman (literally: \\"southern barbarians\\"). Background In October 222, Liu Bei, the founding emperor of Shu, lost the Battle of Xiaoting against Shu's ally- turned-rival state Wu. He died in Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chengdu) in June 223. =Yong Kai's rebellion= Yong Kai (ÈõçÈóì), a descendant of Yong Chi (ÈõçÈΩí) and a tribal chief active in the Nanzhong region, heard about Liu Bei's death and started a rebellion against Shu rule. He killed Zheng Ang (Ê≠£ÊòÇ), the Shu-appointed Administrator of Jianning Commandery (Âª∫ÂØßÈÉ°; around present-day Qujing, Yunnan), and took Zheng Ang's successor Zhang Yi hostage. The Shu general Li Yan wrote a total of six letters to Yong Kai to dissuade him from rebelling, but Yong Kai arrogantly replied: \\"I heard that the sky cannot have two suns and the land cannot have two rulers. Now, from a distance away, I see that the Empire has been divided into three, so I am fearful and confused and do not know whom to pledge allegiance to.\\"(ÈÉΩË≠∑ÊùéÂö¥ËàáÈóìÊõ∏ÂÖ≠Á¥ôÔºåËß£ÂñªÂà©ÂÆ≥ÔºåÈóì‰ΩÜÁ≠î‰∏ÄÁ¥ôÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËìãËÅûÂ§©ÁÑ°‰∫åÊó•ÔºåÂúüÁÑ°‰∫åÁéãÔºå‰ªäÂ§©‰∏ãÈºéÁ´ãÔºåÊ≠£ÊúîÊúâ‰∏âÔºåÊòØ‰ª•ÈÅ†‰∫∫ÊÉ∂ÊÉëÔºå‰∏çÁü•ÊâÄÊ≠∏‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ∂Ê°ÄÊÖ¢Â¶ÇÊ≠§„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Under urging from Shi Xie and the Wu general Bu Zhi, Yong Kai agreed to pledge allegiance to Wu and he sent Zhang Yi as a captive to the Wu emperor Sun Quan to express his sincerity. In return, Sun Quan appointed him as the Administrator of Yongchang Commandery (Ê∞∏ÊòåÈÉ°; covering parts of present-day western Yunnan), which was then guarded by the Shu officials L√º Kai and Wang Kang (Áéã‰ºâ). When Yong Kai showed up to take control of Yongchang, L√º Kai and Wang Kang refused to recognise his legitimacy and led both the local government and civilians alike to resist Yong Kai and prevent him from entering Yongchang. Yong Kai then repeatedly wrote letters to them in an attempt to convince them that he was the rightful Administrator, but L√º Kai refuted Yong Kai's claims and managed to retain control over Yongchang because the people of Yongchang highly regarded and trusted him.(...

At the same time, he also sent Deng Zhi and Chen Zhen as diplomats to Wu to meet Sun Quan and convince him to make peace with Shu and rebuild the Shu‚ÄìWu alliance against their rival state, Wei. In the meantime, Gao Ding (È´òÂÆö; or Gao Dingyuan È´òÂÆöÂÖÉ), the chief of the Sou tribe (ÂèüÊóè) in Yuexi/Yuesui Commandery (Ë∂äÂ∑ÇÈÉ°; around present-day Xichang, Sichuan) heard about Yong Kai's rebellion and decided to join, so he killed Jiao Huang (ÁÑ¶Áíú), the Administrator of Yuexi/Yuesui appointed by the Shu government. While Zhuge Liang was planning for a military campaign against the rebels, he appointed Gong Lu as the new Administrator of Yuexi/Yuesui and sent him there to make preparations in advance. However, Gong Lu ended up being killed by Gao Ding. Around the same time, Zhuge Liang also sent an official, Qi Xing (È†éË°å), to conduct an investigation in Zangke Commandery (ÁâÇÊüØÈÉ°; around present-day Guiyang or Fuquan, Guizhou). Upon arriving in Zangke, Qi Xing detained all the lower-ranked officials for questioning. Zhu Bao (Êú±Ë§í), the Shu-appointed Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Zangke, had heard of the rebellions in the neighbouring Jianning and Yuexi/Yuesui commanderies, so he killed Qi Xing and joined the rebels. =Involvement of Meng Huo and the Nanman= After failing to capture Yongchang Commandery from L√º Kai and Wang Kang, Yong Kai turned to the Nanman tribes for help but they were unwilling to listen to him. Yong Kai then sought help from Meng Huo, a local leader with much influence and popularity among the Nanman. Meng Huo lied to the Nanman that the Shu government had made unreasonable demands from them and successfully incited them to rebel against Shu rule. Pacifying Nanzhong In the spring of 225, after Shu rebuilt its alliance with Wu against their rival state Wei, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, personally led Shu imperial forces south to pacify the Nanzhong region and quell the rebellions. Wang Lian, Zhuge Liang's chief clerk, attempted to dissuade him from participating in the campaign, but Zhuge Liang insisted because he was worried that the Shu generals might not be competent enough to deal with the rebels on their own.(ÊôÇÂçóÊñπË´∏ÈÉ°‰∏çË≥îÔºåË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÂ∞áËá™ÂæÅ‰πãÔºåÈÄ£Ë´´‰ª•ÁÇ∫„ÄåÊ≠§‰∏çÊØõ‰πãÂú∞ÔºåÁñ´Áôò‰πãÈÑâÔºå‰∏çÂÆú‰ª•‰∏ÄÂúã‰πãÊúõÔºåÂÜíÈö™ËÄåË°å„Äç„ÄÇ‰∫ÆÊÖÆË´∏Â∞áÊâç‰∏çÂèäÂ∑±ÔºåÊÑèÊ¨≤ÂøÖÂæÄÔºåËÄåÈÄ£Ë®ÄËºíÊááËá≥ÔºåÊïÖÂÅúÁïôËÄÖ‰πÜ‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 41.

Just as the rebels believed him and lowered their guard, he used the opportunity to strike back and move south to Panjiang (ÊßÉÊ±ü) to meet up with Ma Zhong, who had just defeated Zhu Bao's rebel forces and recaptured Zangke.

He pointed out the problems with leaving non-locals in charge: The people in Nanzhong had recently lost their loved ones in the battles and might still harbour bitter feelings towards the Shu government; if they had non-locals to govern them, they might feel even more resentful and choose to rebel again; if non-locals were put in charge, the Shu government would need to station troops in the area to protect them.(Âçó‰∏≠Âπ≥ÔºåÁöÜÂç≥ÂÖ∂Ê∏†ÁéáËÄåÁî®‰πã„ÄÇÊàñ‰ª•Ë´´‰∫ÆÔºå‰∫ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÂâáÁï∂ÁïôÂÖµÔºåÂÖµÁïôÂâáÁÑ°ÊâÄÈ£üÔºå‰∏Ä‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂä†Â§∑Êñ∞ÂÇ∑Á†¥ÔºåÁà∂ÂÖÑÊ≠ªÂñ™ÔºåÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ËÄåÁÑ°ÂÖµËÄÖÔºåÂøÖÊàêÁ¶çÊÇ£Ôºå‰∫å‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂèàÂ§∑Á¥ØÊúâÂª¢ÊÆ∫‰πãÁΩ™ÔºåËá™Â´åÈáÅÈáçÔºåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÁµÇ‰∏çÁõ∏‰ø°Ôºå‰∏â‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõ‰ªäÂêæÊ¨≤‰Ωø‰∏çÁïôÂÖµÔºå‰∏çÈÅãÁ≥ßÔºåËÄåÁ∂±Á¥ÄÁ≤óÂÆöÔºåÂ§∑„ÄÅÊº¢Á≤óÂÆâÊïÖËÄ≥„ÄÇ„Äç) Han Jin Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 35.(ÁõäÂ∑û„ÄÅÊ∞∏Êòå„ÄÅÁâÇÊüØ„ÄÅË∂äÂ∑ÇÂõõÈÉ°ÁöÜÂπ≥Ôºå‰∫ÆÂçΩÂÖ∂Ê∏†ÁéáËÄåÁî®‰πã„ÄÇÊàñ‰ª•Ë´´‰∫ÆÔºå‰∫ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÂâáÁï∂ÁïôÂÖµÔºåÂÖµÁïôÂâáÁÑ°ÊâÄÈ£üÔºå‰∏Ä‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂä†Â§∑Êñ∞ÂÇ∑Á†¥ÔºåÁà∂ÂÖÑÊ≠ªÂñ™ÔºåÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ËÄåÁÑ°ÂÖµËÄÖÔºåÂøÖÊàêÁ¶çÊÇ£Ôºå‰∫å‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂèàÔºåÂ§∑Á¥ØÊúâÂª¢ÊÆ∫‰πãÁΩ™ÔºåËá™Â´åÈáÅÈáçÔºåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÁµÇ‰∏çÁõ∏‰ø°Ôºå‰∏â‰∏çÊòì‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂêæÊ¨≤‰Ωø‰∏çÁïôÂÖµÔºå‰∏çÈÅãÁ≥ßÔºåËÄåÁ∂±Á¥ÄÁ≤óÂÆöÔºåÂ§∑„ÄÅÊº¢Á≤óÂÆâÊïÖËÄ≥„ÄÇ„Äç) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 70. Before completely withdrawing all Shu soldiers from the Nanzhong region, Zhuge Liang told Meng Huo and the other local leaders that he only required them to pay tribute to the Shu government in the form of gold, silver, oxen, warhorses, etc. He appointed locals such as Li Hui (from Jianning Commandery) and L√º Kai (from Yongchang Commandery) as commandery administrators. These commandery administrators were different from their predecessors in the sense that they only served as representatives of the Shu government in the region; the locals were governed by their respective local leaders and tribal chiefs.(‰∫ÆÊñºÊòØÊÇâÊî∂ÂÖ∂‰øäÂÇëÂ≠üÁç≤Á≠â‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂÆòÂ±¨ÔºåÂá∫ÂÖ∂Èáë„ÄÅÈäÄ„ÄÅ‰∏π„ÄÅÊºÜ„ÄÅËÄïÁâõ„ÄÅÊà∞È¶¨‰ª•Áµ¶ËªçÂúã‰πãÁî®„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 70.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Although historical records mentioned that Zhuge Liang captured and released Meng Huo a total of seven times throughout the campaign, no details were provided. The 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, spends a total of about four-and-a-half chapters (87 to 91) fleshing out the details of each of the seven battles. It includes numerous fictional characters associated with Meng Huo, such as Lady Zhurong (Meng Huo's wife), Meng You (Meng Huo's brother) and other Nanman chieftains such as King Mulu and King Duosi. Apart from this, in the novel, the Shu generals Zhao Yun, Wei Yan and Ma Dai actively participate in the campaign, even though historically there is no mention about their involvement. # First battle: Zhao Yun leads his troops to attack Meng Huo and defeats his army. Wei Yan captures Meng Huo and brings him before Zhuge Liang. When Meng Huo complains that he was captured through trickery, Zhuge Liang releases him and allows him to return for another battle. # Second battle: Meng Huo builds a series of fortifications across a river and taunts the Shu forces to attack him. Ma Dai cuts off his supply route and kills Jinhuan Sanjie, Meng Huo's subordinate who was protecting the river fortifications. Ahuinan and Dongtuna, two of Meng Huo's subordinates, betray their master, capture him and hand him over as a prisoner to Zhuge Liang. Like before, Meng Huo complains that he had did not have a chance to fight the enemy fair and square. Zhuge Liang then shows him around the Shu camp before releasing him. # Third battle: Meng Huo's younger brother Meng You pretends to surrender to Zhuge Liang and lure Meng Huo into a trap. However, Zhuge Liang knows it is a ploy so he also pretends to play along, captures both of them in the trap, and releases them again. # Fourth battle: When Meng Huo hears that the Shu army is planning to retreat, he gathers all his troops and attacks the Shu camp. He falls into the pit traps in the camp and ends up being captured again. Zhuge Liang releases him once more. # Fifth battle: Meng Huo, having learnt his lesson from his previous defeats, adopts a more defensive stance. He lures the Shu forces into the poisonous marshes around the caves of his ally, King Duosi. However, Zhuge Liang manages to avoid the dangers of the marshes with the help of Meng Jie, Meng Huo's elder brother who does not participate in Meng Huo's rebellion against Shu. The Shu forces then defeat and kill King Duosi and capture Meng Huo again. Like before, Zhuge Liang releases Meng Huo again. # Sixth battle: Meng Huo's wife Lady Zhurong joins the battle and captures the Shu generals Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni. Ma Dai defeats Lady Zhurong later and captures her. Zhuge Liang releases Lady Zhurong in exchange for Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni. Meng Huo then turns to his ally King Mulu for help. King Mulu has the ability to control wild animals and direct them in battle. However, the Shu army is prepared for this and they use fire-breathing contraptions (referred to as juggernauts in some translations) to scare away the animals. King Mulu is killed in battle and Meng Huo ends up being captured again, but Zhuge Liang releases him once more. # Seventh battle: Meng Huo turns to another ally, Wutugu, for help. Wutugu's soldiers wear a special type of armour made of rattan which can deflect sharp blades and arrows. Zhuge Liang comes up with a plan for Wei Yan to lure Wutugu and his army into a trap in a valley, where explosives and fire traps have been set. The flammable rattan armour catches fire easily and Wutugu and his army completely perish in the valley. Meng Huo is captured once more. This time, he feels ashamed of himself and decides to surrender to Zhuge Liang and swear allegiance to Shu for the rest of his life. In popular culture A popular legend tells of how Zhuge Liang invented the mantou, a kind of steamed bun, during this campaign. It probably rose from the fact that the name mantou () is homonymous with mantou (). The story tells that, on the way back after the campaign, Zhuge Liang and the Shu army came to a swift-flowing river which defied all attempts to cross it. Locals informed him that he must sacrifice 50 men and throw their heads into the river to appease the river deity, who will then allow them to cross. As Zhuge Liang did not want to cause further bloodshed, he ordered buns shaped roughly like human heads ‚Äì round with a flat base ‚Äì to be made and thrown into the river. After a successful crossing, he named the bun \\"barbarian's head\\", which evolved into the present-day mantou. The southern campaign has been reenacted in a number of video games, including Koei's Dynasty Warriors series and Sangokushi Koumeiden. Both follow the events described in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and the player can defeat Meng Huo up to seven times. A whole chapter (out of five) is dedicated to this campaign in Sangokushi Koumeiden. References * Chang, Qu ( 4th century). Chronicles of Huayang (Huayang Guo Zhi). * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Early life William David Ormsby-Gore was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family on 20 May 1918 in Westminster, London, the second son of William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech, a Conservative politician, and Lady Beatrice Edith Mildred Gascoyne-Cecil. His maternal great-grandfather was British Prime Minister The 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. He was educated at St Cyprian's School, Eton College and New College, Oxford. A well-known story told of him at Eton is that, when a boy in his house killed himself, the housemaster called the boys together, and asked if any of them had any idea why this should have happened. Ormsby-Gore put up his hand and asked, \\"Please sir, could it have been the food?\\"Brian Johnston, A further slice of Johnners (Random House, 2011)Alex Renton, Stiff Upper Lip (Hachette UK, 2017) In 1939, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery (Berkshire Yeomanry Field Regiment), served in the 'Phantom' reconnaissance unit, and worked with airborne and other special units. By the end of the War, he held the rank of major on the general staff. After the war, his father handed over to him all his land, and Ormsby-Gore farmed the 400 acres (1.6 km¬≤) of the Woodhill Estate, Oswestry, Shropshire. In 1948, he was commissioned a Major in the Shropshire Yeomanry, but left in 1950. Career =Member of Parliament= At the 1950 general election, he was elected Member of Parliament for Oswestry, which he remained until 1961. Under Prime Minister Anthony Eden he served briefly, from November 1956 to January 1957, as Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan he was from 1957 to 1961 Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. After the election of U.S. President John F. Kennedy he was appointed British Ambassador to the United States on 18 October 1961. This meant that he had to take the Chiltern Hundreds on 1 June, so that he could resign from the House. =Ambassador to the United States= Ormsby-Gore knew Kennedy well from his time in London, where his father Joseph P. Kennedy had served as American Ambassador. Like Macmillan, Ormsby-Gore was distantly related to Kennedy, but had a closer relationship than did Macmillan with the President-elect and his brother Robert. Six months after Kennedy took office Ormsby-Gore was in Washington, D.C. Referred to under the Kennedy administration as \\"our kind of Ambassador\\", he supplied Kennedy with a stream of advice and Cuban cigars via his diplomatic bag. He was almost a resident at the White House, being more a friend of the family than a mere ambassador. After President Kennedy's assassination there were rumours of a romance between Ormsby-Gore and Jacqueline Kennedy. In 1968 he proposed marriage to her, but, she did not accept. Ormsby-Gore was one of the pallbearers at Robert F. Kennedy's funeral along with Robert McNamara, John Glenn, W. Averell Harriman, C. Douglas Dillon, Kirk Lemoyne Billings (schoolmate of John F. Kennedy), Stephen Edward Smith (husband to Jean Ann Kennedy), David Hackett, Jim Whittaker and John Seigenthaler Sr. Under the Lyndon B. Johnson administration relations were more formal but remained excellent; and Ormsby-Gore maintained his position after the Labour government took power in Britain in 1964. A fierce opponent of oil-barrel politics, Ormsby-Gore's terse dismissal of the phenomenon ran: \\"It would indeed be a tragedy if the history of the human race proved to be nothing more than the story of an ape playing with a box of matches on a petrol dump.\\" The extent of his influence over the Kennedy administration is disputed. Unable to persuade the American government to agree with the British line over Yemen and the Congo, or to proceed with either a negotiated settlement with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev over Berlin or the Skybolt ballistic missile programme, he nevertheless played a significant role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and ensured that Britain's views were taken into account by the American government. The friendships of Ormsby-Gore and Macmillan with John F. Kennedy helped secure the first Test-Ban Treaty in 1963. Macmillan and Ormsby-Gore had been attempting to achieve a test-ban treaty with the Russians for the past ten years, and won Kennedy over through letters from Macmillan and frank discussions between Ormsby-Gore and Kennedy. They convinced him to act like a statesman and conclude Test-ban treaties with Russia and not fear being branded as an appeaser by political opponents in the United States. Ormsby-Gore was a participant in what is referred to as a \\"twenty-five year conversation to do with the role of a leader in a democratic society\\". He encouraged Kennedy to remain focused on issues relevant to the world and the future, rather than attempting to protect himself politically. According to the Duchess of Devonshire, who travelled with the British delegation to Kennedy's funeral in November 1963, Macmillan's successor as Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home had wanted to appoint Ormsby-Gore as Foreign Secretary, but R. A. Butler had insisted on having this post as a condition of serving under Home.Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire, Diary, 27 November 1963, quoted in Deborah Devonshire (2010) Wait For Me! After Kennedy's assassination, Ormsby- Gore became involved in a relationship with his widow Jacqueline, going withon a vacation with in Cambodia. He proposed marriage to her in 1965 and was turned down. In 1968, when she married the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, Lord Harlech was opposed and wrote to her asking her mind to change her mind.. =Later life= Ormsby-Gore retired as ambassador in 1965, a year after his father died, and took his seat in the House of Lords as Lord Harlech, briefly also holding the position of deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. He also had a successful career as a television executive, founding HTV, and served as president of the British Board of Film Classification. He had an active interest in the avant-garde, and for nearly ten years, beginning in 1969, was patron of the Institute for Research in Art and Technology. Personal life On 9 February 1940, Lord Harlech married Sylvia Lloyd (b. 24 Apr 1920)Hywel Trewyn & Tony Bonnici, \\"Lord Harlech's tragic life and death\\", Daily Post, 15 November 2016.

In 1968, Lord Harlech proposed to the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy, whom he had been friends with since before her husband's assassination. Jacqueline Kennedy declined his offer of marriage in a letter, writing: \\"If ever I can find some healing and some comfort ‚Äî it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain ... I can find that now if the world will let us.\\" She later married Aristotle Onassis. On 11 December 1969, Lord Harlech married American socialite Pamela Colin, daughter of a Manhattan top corporate lawyer, herself a London resident editor of Vogue and then food editor of the British Vogue.\\"Lord Harlech obituary: Wife's departure was the start of peer's sad decline\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, February 12, 2016. The wedding was attended by Princess Margaret, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, the Earl and Countess of Drogheda, the Earl and Countess of Airlie, The Countess Gowrie, Lord and Lady David Cecil, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, J.

Crystals have the form of cubic icositetrahedra but, as first observed by Sir David Brewster in 1821, they are not optically isotropic, and are therefore pseudo-cubic. Goniometric measurements made by Gerhard vom Rath in 1873 led him to refer the crystals to the tetragonal system. Optical investigations have since proved the crystals to be still more complex in character, and to consist of several orthorhombic or monoclinic individuals, which are optically biaxial and repeatedly twinned, giving rise to twin-lamellae and to striations on the faces. When the crystals are raised to a temperature of about 500 ¬∞C they become optically isotropic and the twin-lamellae and striations disappear, although they reappear when the crystals are cooled again. This pseudo-cubic character of leucite is very similar to that of the mineral boracite. The crystals are white or ash-grey in colour, hence the name suggested by A. G. Werner in 1701, from ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫ŒøœÇ, '(matt) white'. They are transparent and glassy when fresh, albeit with a noticeably subdued 'subvitreous' lustre due to the low refractive index, but readily alter to become waxy/greasy and then dull and opaque; they are brittle and break with a conchoidal fracture. The Mohs hardness is 5.5, and the specific gravity 2.47. Inclusions of other minerals, arranged in concentric zones, are frequently present in the crystals. On account of the color and form of the crystals the mineral was early known as 'white garnet'. French authors in older literature may employ Ren√© Just Ha√ºy's name amphig√®ne, but 'leucite' is the only name for this mineral species that is recognised as official by the International Mineralogical Association.

Argentite belongs to the galena group. Silver is extracted from the ore-argentite. The name \\"argentite\\" sometimes also refers to pseudomorphs of argentite: specimens of acanthite which still display some of the outward signs of the cubic crystal form, even though their actual crystal structure is monoclinic due to the lower temperature. This form of acanthite is occasionally found as uneven cubes and octahedra, but more often as dendritic or earthy masses, with a blackish lead-grey color and metallic luster. Cleavage, which is so prominent a feature in galena, here presents only in traces. The mineral is perfectly sectile and has a shining streak; hardness 2.5, specific gravity is 7.2‚Äì7.4. It occurs in mineral veins, and when found in large masses, as in Mexico and in the Comstock Lode in Nevada, it forms an important ore of silver. The mineral was mentioned in 1529 by G. Agricola, but the name argentite was not used till 1845 and is due to W. Haidinger. Old names for the species are Glaserz, silver-glance and vitreous silver. A related copper-rich mineral occurring e.g. in Jalpa, Zacatecas, Mexico, is known as jalpaite.

Jacobs, J.T. Allen and G.R. Bozzoli 1937. Wonderstone. Geological Survey of South Africa Bulletin no. 8. Uses The compact variety of pyrophyllite is used for slate pencils and tailors' chalk (French chalk), and is carved by the Chinese into small images and ornaments of various kinds. Other soft compact minerals (steatite and pinite) used for these Chinese carvings are included with pyrophyllite under the terms agalmatolite and pagodite. Pyrophyllite is easily machineable and has excellent thermal stability, so it is added to clay to reduce thermal expansion when firing, but it has many other industry uses when combined with other compounds, such as in insecticide and for making bricks. Pyrophyllite is also widely used in high-pressure experiments, both as a gasket material and as a pressure-transmitting medium. See also * References .

The Maribyrnong River is a perennial river of the Port Phillip catchment, located in the northwestern suburbs of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria. Course The Maribyrnong River draws its headwaters from near Mount Macedon within the Macedon Ranges, part of the Great Dividing Range. Formed by the confluence of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek below , the river flows generally southward, joined by two minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Yarra River at , to eventually empty into Port Phillip. The river descends over its course. =Headwaters= Jackson Creek, a tributary of the Maribyrnong River at Clarkefield. The head of the Maribyrnong catchment is situated in the Macedon Ranges region of central Victoria around northwest of Melbourne City Centre. Various creeks beginning in the southern Mount Macedon area flow into Riddells Creek which in turn flows into the Jackson Creek. The Jackson Creek starts its journey northwest of Gisborne, north of Melbourne CBD. The other major tributary of the Maribyrnong is Deep Creek, which also has its headwaters in the northern and eastern parts of the Macedon Ranges. The creek has cut a deep valley through the surrounding basalt plains in its southward course, in particular as it flows through localities such as Konagaderra and Bulla. To the west of Melbourne Airport the tributaries of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek conjoin to form the Maribyrnong River. The Organ Pipes National Park can be found adjacent to the Jackson Creek, near the Calder Freeway, with picnic facilities and a prominent display of basaltic columns a geological formation, so named because they look like organ pipes. =Middle reaches= Maribyrnong River at Brimbank Park The river flows south and west. At Keilor the river winds back on itself in a giant horseshoe bend, before winding south again at Brimbank Park. Here the river flows below the western plains. Brimbank Park forms a huge amphitheatre in the bend in the river with picnic areas, cycle and walking trails, and a caf√©, that is usually busy on weekends and public holidays. The area is rich in birdlife and native fauna. The Maribyrnong River Trail shared path starts at Brimbank Park, following mostly beside the river to near its conjunction with the Yarra River in Footscray. At Avondale Heights and Essendon West residents have views over the river valley to the skyscrapers of the Melbourne CBD. =Lower reaches= Aerial panorama of Flemington Racecourse along the Maribyrnong. Taken August 2018. The river flows past Pipemakers Park at Maribyrnong and Melbourne's Living Museum of the West which presents information on the history of the river and the early industrial history of the site. Dolphins are sometimes sighted in the lower reaches of the river, along with many water birds, especially at Burndap Park. Footscray Park opposite the Flemington Racecourse is only metres down river from Pipemakers Park and Burndap Park, the river then meanders across the floodplain to its juncture with the Yarra River at Yarraville.

The name Maribyrnong however, is derived from either mirring-gnay-bir-nong which in Woiwurrung, the language of the local Wurundjeri people, is said to mean \\"I can hear a ringtail possum\\" or \\"saltwater river\\" (Gunung or Gunnung is Woiwurrung for river, as seen in the names of other watercourses in the area, such as; Koonung Creek and Birrarung). Marriburnong is an alternate spelling listed on a map dated from 1840. The inner western and north-western suburbs of Melbourne are located in the vicinity of the Maribyrnong River and the river has given its name to the suburb of Maribyrnong and the local government area, the City of Maribyrnong. History The Maribyrnong River valley has been home for the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation for up to years. Human remains dated at least yearsold have been found along the river, with much older signs of human habitation also present. The first Europeans to explore along the river were the party led by Charles Grimes, Deputy Surveyor-General of New South Wales, in February 1803. John Batman is likely to have explored up the river in early 1835. With the establishment of the colony of Melbourne later that year, sheep runs were soon established by Edmund Davis Fergusson and Michael Solomon in the Avondale and Sunshine areas. On Solomon's sheep station the ford now near the west end of Canning Street in Avondale Heights soon became known as Solomon's Ford. This was the lowest crossing on the Saltwater (Maribyrnong) River, and the furthest inland point of tidal influence. Batman is believed to have crossed the river at this point probably in the well worn steps of Aboriginals. It was for many years the only way from Melbourne to Geelong and land west. During the second half of the 19th century much of Melbourne's industry was located along the river, and the water became very degraded. With the closure of many industries since the 1960s and 1970s, much river front land has opened up to parkland and highly sought after residential estates. Recreational use As the second major river in metropolitan Melbourne, the Maribyrnong plays a very important part in Melbourne's recreation. Boating, cycling along its bike paths such as the Maribyrnong River Trail, fishing, and walking. Light bushwalking can also be done and nature watchers can observe Australian native fauna such as echidna, wallabies as well as the ubiquitous possums and flying foxes.

Native mammals include swamp wallabies, grey-headed flying foxes, common brushtail possums, common ringtail possums, water rats, echidnas, and platypus in the upper reaches of the river. Native reptile species include eastern brown snakes, tiger snakes, skinks, and common snakeneck turtles. Native birds include the eastern whipbird, cockatoo, rainbow lorikeet, galah, brown falcon, peregrine falcon, square-tailed kite, royal spoonbill, black swan, Pacific black duck, little pied cormorant, moorhen, and long-billed corella. There are various native frogs and native fish species include the short-finned eel, tupong, short-headed lamprey, Australian grayling, southern black bream, common galaxias, broad-finned galaxias and spotted galaxias. Starfish may also be found in the river. =Introduced species= Introduced species include the red fox, European rabbit, and feral cat. While introduced birds include the song thrush, common blackbird, common myna, common starling, house sparrow, spotted turtle dove, rock pigeon, and mallard. Common carp have also been introduced to the river.

The term first came into popular usage after it was used in a 1946 speech by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The two nations have been close allies during many conflicts in the 20th and 21st centuries, including World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and the War on Terror. Although both governments also have close relationships with many other nations, the level of cooperation between the U.K. and the U.S. in trade and commerce, military planning, execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and intelligence sharing has been described as \\"unparalleled\\" among major world powers. The close relationships between British and American heads of government such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as well as between Tony Blair and both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have been noted. At the diplomatic level, characteristics include recurring public representations of the relationship as \\"special\\", frequent and high-profile political visits and extensive information exchange at the diplomatic working level. Some critics deny the existence of a \\"special relationship\\", calling it a myth.John Baylis, \\"The 'special Relationship' A Diverting British Myth?,\\" in Cyril Buffet, Beatrice Heuser (eds.), Haunted by History: Myths in International Relations, ch. 10, Berghahn Books, 1998, Former U.S. President Barack Obama considered Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel to be his \\"closest international partner\\" and said the U.K. would be at the \\"back of the queue\\" in any trade deal with the U.S. if it left the European Union, while accusing British Prime Minister David Cameron of being \\"distracted by a range of other things\\" during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened to revoke IMF loans due to Britain's invasion of Egypt to recapture the Suez Canal. In the 1960s, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson rebuffed U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's request to employ British troops in the Vietnam War. Prime Minister Thatcher also privately opposed the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, while President Reagan unsuccessfully pressured against the 1982 Falklands War. Following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, the British government under Prime Minister Theresa May sought to establish \\"a new special relationship\\" with the Trump administration. Trump claimed his relationship with Theresa May was \\"the highest level of special.\\" Origins Although the \\"Special Relationship\\" between the U.K. and the U.S. was perhaps most memorably emphasized by Churchill, its existence, and even the term itself, had been recognized since the 19th century, not least by rival powers.Existence in the 19th century and early 20th century: * , quoting the \\"semi-official organ\\" the North-German Gazette: \\"There is, therefore, not the slightest occasion for other States to adopt as their model and example a form of agreement which may, perhaps, be advantage to England and America in their special relationship\\". * \\"No Ambassador to this or any other nation is similarly honoured ... It is intended to be, we need hardly say, precisely what it is, a unique compliment, a recognition on our part that Great Britain and the United States stand to one another in a special relationship, and that between them some departure from the merely official attitude is most natural\\". * \\"The answer of the [Japanese] Ambassador [Baron Kato] shows that he and his Government even then [1911] appreciated the special relationship between this country [the United Kingdom] and the United States ... That, probably, the Japanese Government understands now, as clearly as their predecessors understood in 1911 that we could never make war on the United States\\". * \\"After comparing the programmes of Britain, America, and Japan, the First Lord said that so far from importing into our maintenance of the one- Power standard a spirit of keen and jealous competition, we had, on the contrary, interpreted it with a latitude which could only be justified by our desire to avoid provoking competition and by our conception of the special relationship of good will and mutual understanding between ourselves and the United States\\". * \\"As was well pointed out in our columns yesterday by Professor Muirhead, Great Britain stands in a quite special relationship to that great Republic [the United States]\\". * quoting J. A. Spender: \\"The problem for British and Americans was to make their special relationship a good relationship, to be candid and open with each other, and to refrain from the envy and uncharitableness which too often in history had embittered the dealings of kindred peoples\\". The governments of the United States and Britain were enemies when foreign relations between them first began, after the American colonies declared their independence from British rule, triggering the American Revolutionary War. Relations often continued to be strained through the mid-19th century, erupting into conflict during the War of 1812 and again verging on war when Britain almost supported the rebel Confederacy in the early part of the American Civil War. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1830s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in the Aroostook War in 1838‚Äì39 and the Oregon boundary dispute in 1844‚Äì46. However, British middle-class public opinion sensed a common \\"special relationship\\" between the two peoples based on their shared language, migrations, evangelical Protestantism, classical liberalism, and extensive private trade. This constituency rejected war, forcing London to appease the Americans. During the Trent Affair of late 1861, London drew the line and Washington retreated.George L. Bernstein, \\"Special Relationship and Appeasement: Liberal policy towards America in the age of Palmerston.\\" Historical Journal 41#3 (1998): 725‚Äì750. Troops from the two nations had begun fighting side-by-side, sometimes spontaneously, in skirmishes overseas by 1859, and the two democracies shared a common bond of sacrifice during World War I. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's visit to the U.S. in 1930 confirmed his own belief in the \\"special relationship\\", and for this reason he looked to the Washington Treaty rather than a revival of the Anglo‚ÄìJapanese alliance as the guarantee of peace in the Far East. However, as the historian David Reynolds observes: \\"For most of the period since 1919, Anglo-American relations had been cool and often suspicious. United States 'betrayal' of the League of Nations was only the first in a series of US actions‚Äîover war debts, naval rivalry, the 1931‚Äì2 Manchurian crisis and the Depression‚Äîthat convinced British leaders that the United States could not be relied on\\". Equally, as President Harry S. Truman's Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, recalled: \\"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America‚Äîour common language and history ensured that. But unique did not mean affectionate. We had fought England as an enemy as often as we had fought by her side as an ally\\". Churchillian emphasis A poster from World War I showing Britannia arm-in-arm with Uncle Sam, symbolizing the Anglo‚ÄìAmerican alliance The outbreak of World War II provoked the rapid emergence of an unambiguously positive relationship between the two nations. The fall of France in 1940 has been described as a decisive event in international relations, leading the Special Relationship to displace the Entente Cordiale as the pivot of the international system. During the war, one observer noted that \\"Great Britain and the United States integrated their military efforts to a degree unprecedented among major allies in the history of warfare\\". \\"Each time I must choose between you and Roosevelt\\", Churchill shouted at General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French, in 1945, \\"I shall choose Roosevelt\\". Between 1939 and 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt exchanged 1,700 letters and telegrams and met 11 times. Churchill estimated that they had 120 days of close personal contact. On one occasion Roosevelt went to Churchill's room when Churchill had just emerged from the bath. On his return from Washington Churchill said to King George VI, \\"Sir, I believe I am the only man in the world to have received the head of a nation naked.\\"Richard M. Langworth, \\"Churchill's Naked Encounter\\", (27 May 2011), https://richardlangworth.com/churchills-naked-encounter Churchill's mother was a U.S. citizen, and he keenly felt the links between the two English-speaking peoples. He first used the term \\"special relationship\\" on 16 February 1944, when he said it was his \\"deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship ‚Ä¶ another destructive war will come to pass\\". He used it again in 1945 to describe not the Anglo‚ÄìAmerican relationship alone, but the U.K.'s relationship with both the U.S. and Canada. The New York Times Herald quoted Churchill in November 1945: Churchill used the phrase again a year later, at the onset of the Cold War, this time to note the special relationship between the U.S. on the one hand, and the English- speaking nations of the British Commonwealth and Empire under the leadership of the U.K. on the other. The occasion was his \\"Sinews of Peace Address\\", delivered in Fulton, Missouri, on 5 March 1946: In the opinion of one international relations specialist: \\"the United Kingdom's success in obtaining US commitment to cooperation in the postwar world was a major triumph, given the isolation of the interwar period\\". A senior British diplomat in Moscow, Thomas Brimelow, admitted: \\"The one quality which most disquiets the Soviet government is the ability which they attribute to us to get others to do our fighting for us ... they respect not us, but our ability to collect friends\\". Conversely, \\"the success or failure of United States foreign economic peace aims depended almost entirely on its ability to win or extract the co- operation of Great Britain\\". Reflecting on the symbiosis, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1982 declared: \\"The Anglo-American relationship has done more for the defence and future of freedom than any other alliance in the world\\". Meeting of the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chief of the Defence Staff in 2006 While most government officials on both sides have supported the Special Relationship, there have been sharp critics. British journalist Guy Arnold (1932‚Äì2020) denounced it in 2014 as a \\"sickness in the body politic of Britain that needs to be flushed out\\". Instead Arnold calls for closer relationships with Europe and Russia so as to rid \\"itself of the US incubus.\\"Guy Arnold, America and Britain: Was There Ever a Special Relationship? (London: Hurst, 2014) pp 6, 153 Military cooperation United Kingdom and United States at a World War II memorial in Upper Benefield, England The intense level of military co-operation between the UK and US began with the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in December 1941, a military command with authority over all US and British operations. Following the end of the Second World War the joint command structure was disbanded, but close military cooperation between the nations resumed in the early 1950s with the start of the Cold War.Derek E. Mix - The United Kingdom: Background and Relations with the United States - fas.org. Congressional Research Service. 29 April 2015. Retrieved 13 April 2017. =Shared military bases= Since the Second World War and the subsequent Berlin Blockade, the US has maintained substantial forces in Great Britain. In July 1948, the first American deployment began with the stationing of B-29 bombers. Currently, an important base is the radar facility RAF Fylingdales, part of the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, although this base is operated under British command and has only one USAF representative for largely administrative reasons. Several bases with a significant US presence include RAF Menwith Hill (only a short distance from RAF Fylingdales), RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall (scheduled to close in 2027), RAF Fairford (the only base for US strategic bombers in Europe), RAF Croughton (not an air base but a military communications hub) and RAF Welford (an ammunition storage depot).Richard Reeve, ORG Explains #6: UK-US Defence and Security Relations, Oxford Research Group (July 2018, updated May 2019), p.4. Retrieved 3 June 2019. Following the end of the Cold War, which was the main rationale for their presence, the number of US facilities in the UK has been reduced in number in line with the US military worldwide. Despite this, these bases have been used extensively in support of various peacekeeping and offensive operations of the 1990s and early 21st century. The two nations also jointly operate on the British military facilities of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory and on Ascension Island, a dependency of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. The US Navy also makes occasional use of British naval bases at Gibraltar and Bermuda and the US Air Force uses RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus, mainly for reconnaissance flights.Reeve, UK-US Defence and Security Relations pp.4-5. =Nuclear weapons development= The Quebec Agreement of 1943 paved the way for the two countries to develop atomic weapons side by side, the UK handing over vital documents from its own Tube Alloys project and sending a delegation to assist in the work of the Manhattan Project. The US later kept the results of the work to itself under the postwar McMahon Act, but after the UK developed its own thermonuclear weapons, the US agreed to supply delivery systems, designs and nuclear material for British warheads through the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement. The UK purchased first Polaris and then the US Trident system which remains in use. The 1958 agreement gave the UK access to the facilities at the Nevada Test Site, and from 1963 it conducted a total of 21 underground tests there before the cessation of testing in 1991.'Time Runs Out as Clinton Dithers over Nuclear Test', Independent On Sunday (20 June 1993), p. 13. The agreement under which this partnership operates was updated in 2004; anti-nuclear activists argued renewal may breach the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.Richard Norton- Taylor, Nuclear weapons treaty may be illegal, The Guardian (27 July 2004).

The U.K. was involved in writing the specification and selection and its largest defense contractor, BAE Systems, is a partner of the American prime contractor Lockheed Martin. BAE Systems is also the largest foreign supplier to the US Defense Department and has been permitted to buy important US defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems and United Defense. The US operates several British designs including Chobham Armour, the Harrier GR9/AV-8B Harrier II and the US Navy T-45 Goshawk. The UK also operates several American designs, including the Javelin anti-tank missile, M270 rocket artillery, the Apache gunship, C-130 Hercules and C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft. Other areas of cooperation =Intelligence sharing= RAF Menwith Hill near Harrogate, England, which provides communications and intelligence support services to both the United Kingdom and the United States A cornerstone of the Special Relationship is the collecting and sharing of intelligence. This originated during World War II with the sharing of code-breaking knowledge and led to the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, signed at Bletchley Park. After World War II the common goal of monitoring and countering the threat of communism prompted the UK-USA Security Agreement of 1948. This agreement brought together the SIGINT organizations of the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and is still in place today (see: Five Eyes). The head of the CIA station in London attends each weekly meeting of the British Joint Intelligence Committee. One present-day example of such cooperation is the UKUSA Community, comprising the U.S. National Security Agency, the U.K. Government Communications Headquarters, Australia's Defence Signals Directorate and Canada's Communications Security Establishment collaborating on ECHELON, a global intelligence gathering system. Under classified bilateral accords, UKUSA members do not spy on each other.Bob Drogin and Greg Miller, 'Purported Spy Memo May Add to US Troubles at UN', Los Angeles Times (4 March 2003). Following the discovery of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, the CIA began to assist the Security Service (MI5) by running its own agent networks in the British Pakistani community. One intelligence official commented on the threat against the US from British Islamists: \\"The fear is that something like this would not just kill people but cause a historic rift between the US and the UK\\".Tim Shipman, 'Why the CIA has to spy on Britain', The Spectator (28 February 2009), pp. 20‚Äì1. =Economic policy= The U.S. is the largest source of foreign direct investment to the U.K., and the U.K. is likewise the largest single foreign direct investor in the U.S.\\"Country Profiles: United States of America\\" on UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office website British trade and capital have been important components of the American economy since its colonial inception. In trade and finance, the Special Relationship has been described as \\"well- balanced\\", with London's \\"light-touch\\" regulation in recent years attracting a massive outflow of capital from New York.Irwin Seltzer, 'Britain is not America's economic poodle', The Spectator (30 September 2006), p. 36. The key sectors for British exporters to the U.S. are aviation, aerospace, commercial property, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and heavy machinery.\\"International Trade ‚Äì The 51st State?\\", Midlands Business Insider (1 July 2007). British ideas, classical and modern, have also exerted a profound influence on U.S. economic policy, most notably those of the historian Adam Smith on free trade and the economist John Maynard Keynes on counter-cyclical spending, while the British government has adopted workfare reforms from the U.S. American and British investors share entrepreneurial attitudes towards the housing market, and the fashion and music industries of each country are major influences on their counterparts.Seltzer, 'Not America's economic poodle', p. 36. Trade ties have been strengthened by globalisation, while both governments agree on the need for currency reform in China and educational reform at home to increase their competitiveness against India's developing service industries. In 2007, the U.S. ambassador suggested to British business leaders that the Special Relationship could be used \\"to promote world trade and limit environmental damage as well as combating terrorism\\".'Special ties should be used for trade and the climate says US ambassador', Western Daily Press (4 April 2007), p. 36. In a press conference that made several references to the Special Relationship, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in London with U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague on 9 September 2013, said: History The Special Relationship has often depended on the personal relations between British prime ministers and U.S. presidents. The first example was the close relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt, who were in fact distantly related.Spencer family Prior to their collaboration during World War II, Anglo‚ÄìAmerican relations had been somewhat frosty. President Woodrow Wilson and Prime Minister David Lloyd George in Paris had been the only previous leaders of the two nations to meet face-to-face, but had enjoyed nothing that could be described as a \\"special relationship\\", although Lloyd George's wartime Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, got on well with Wilson during his time in the US and helped convince the previously skeptical president to enter World War I. Churchill spent much time and effort cultivating the relationship, which paid dividends for the war effort. Two great architects of the Special Relationship on a practical level were Field Marshal Sir John Dill and General George Marshall, whose excellent personal relations and senior positions (Roosevelt was especially close to Marshall) oiled the wheels of the alliance considerably. Major links were created during the war, such as the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Britain, previously somewhat the senior partner, had found herself the junior beginning in 1941. The diplomatic policy was thus two-pronged, encompassing strong personal support and equally forthright military and political aid. These two have always operated in tandem; that is to say, the best personal relationships between British prime ministers and American presidents have always been those based around shared goals. For example, Harold Wilson's government would not commit troops to Vietnam, and Wilson and Lyndon Johnson did not get on especially well. Peaks in the Special Relationship include the bonds between Harold Macmillan (who like Churchill had an American mother) and John F. Kennedy; between James Callaghan and Jimmy Carter, who were close personal friends despite their differences in personality; between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan; and more recently between Tony Blair and both Bill Clinton and George W.

Immediately at the start of Churchill's premiership, the Battle of Dunkirk took place. Before Churchill's premiership, President Roosevelt had secretively been in frequent correspondence with him. Their correspondence had begun in September 1939, at the very start of World War II. In these private communications, the two had been discussing ways in which the US might support Britain in their war effort.Warren F. Kimball, ed. Churchill and Roosevelt, The Complete Correspondence (3 vol Princeton UP, 1984). However, at the time when Winston Churchill assumed the office of Prime Minister, Roosevelt was nearing the end of his second term and making considerations of seeking election to an unprecedented third term (he would make no public pronouncements about this until the Democratic National Convention that year). From the American experience during the First World War, Roosevelt judged that involvement in the Second World War was likely to be an inevitability. This was a key reason for Roosevelt's decision to break from tradition and seek a third term. Roosevelt desired to be president when the US would finally be drawn into entering the conflict. However, in order to win a third term, Roosevelt made the American people promises that he would keep them out of the war. In November 1940, upon Roosevelt's victory in the presidential election, Churchill sent him a congratulatory letter, Having promised the American public to avoid entering any foreign war, Roosevelt went as far as public opinion allowed in providing financial and military aid to Britain, France and China. In a December 1940 talk, dubbed the Arsenal of Democracy Speech, Roosevelt declared, \\"This is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk about national security\\". He went on to declare the importance of American support of Britain's war effort, framing it as a matter of national security for the U.S. As the American public opposed involvement in the conflict, Roosevelt sought to emphasize that it was critical to assist the British in order to prevent the conflict from reaching American shores. He aimed to paint the British war effort as beneficial to the US by arguing that they would contain the Nazi threat from spreading across the Atlantic. Churchill's edited copy of the final draft of the Atlantic Charter To assist the British war effort, Roosevelt enacted the Lend-Lease policy and drafted the Atlantic Charter with Churchill. The US ultimately joined the war effort in December 1941, under Roosevelt's leadership.\\"A Chronology of US Historical Documents\\". Oklahoma College of Law Roosevelt and Churchill had a relative fondness of one another. They connected on their shared passions for tobacco and liquors, and their mutual interest in history and battleships. Churchill later wrote, \\"I felt I was in contact with a very great man, who was also a warm-hearted friend, and the foremost champion of the high causes which we served.\\" One anecdote that has been told to illustrate the intimacy of Churchill and Roosevelt's bond alleges that once, while hosting Churchill at the White House, Roosevelt stopped by the bedroom in which the Prime Minister was staying to converse with him. Churchill answered his door in a state of nudity, remarking, \\"You see, Mr. President, I have nothing to hide from you.\\" The president is said to have taken this in good humor, later joking with an aide that Churchill was, \\"pink and white all over.\\" Between 1939 and 1945, Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged an estimated 1700 letters and telegrams and met with one another 11 times. On Churchill's 60th birthday, Roosevelt wrote him, \\"It is fun to be in the same decade as you.\\" Beginning under Roosevelt and Churchill, the U.S. and U.K. worked together closely to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO. =Churchill and Truman (April ‚Äì July 1945)= 1945 election). Roosevelt died in April 1945, shortly into his fourth term in office, and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry Truman. Churchill and Truman likewise developed a strong relationship with one another. While he was saddened by the death of Roosevelt, Churchill was a strong supporter of Truman in his early presidency, calling him, \\"the type of leader the world needs when it needs him most.\\" At the Potsdam Conference, Truman and Churchill, along with Joseph Stalin, made agreements for settling the boundaries of Europe.Jenkins, Roy. Churchill: A Biography (2001); p. 849 / =Attlee and Truman (July 1945 ‚Äì October 1951)= Truman meeting with Attlee during the Potsdam Conference Four months into Truman's presidency, Churchill's party was handed a surprise defeat at the polls, and Clement Attlee became Prime Minister. The deputy in Churchill's wartime coalition government, Attlee had been in the US at the time of Roosevelt's death, and thus had met with Truman immediately after he took office. The two of them had come to like one another. However, Attlee and Truman never became particularly close with one another. During their coinciding tenure as heads of government, they only met on three occasions. The two did not maintain regular correspondence. Their working relationship with each other, nonetheless, remained sturdy. When Attlee assumed the position of Prime Minister, negotiations had not yet been completed at the Potsdam Conference, which had begun on 17 July. Attlee took Churchill's place at the conference once he was named Prime Minister on 26 July. Therefore, Attlee's first sixteen days as Prime Minister were spent handling negotiations at the conference. Attlee flew to Washington in December 1950 to support Truman in standing up against Douglas MacArthur. In 1951, Truman pressured Attlee not to intervene against Mossadeq in Iran. In his time as Prime Minister, Attlee also managed to convince Truman to agree to greater nuclear cooperation. =Churchill and Truman (October 1951 ‚Äì January 1953)= Blair House in 1949 Churchill became Prime Minister again in October 1951. He had maintained his relationship with Truman during his six-year stint as Leader of the Opposition. In 1946, on invitation from Truman, Churchill visited the U.S. to deliver a speech at Westminster College in Truman's home state of Missouri. The speech, which would be remembered as the \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech, affected greater public attention to the schism that had developed between the Soviet Union and the rest of the Allied Powers. During this trip, Churchill lost a significant amount of cash in a poker game with Harry Truman and his advisors.; retrieved 23 March 2009. In 1947, Churchill had written Truman an unheeded memo recommending that the US make a pre-emptive atomic bomb strike on Moscow before the Soviet Union could acquire nuclear weapons themselves.Kevin Ruane, Churchill and the Bomb in War and Cold War (2016) p. 156. Churchill and Eden visited Washington in January 1952. At the time, Truman's administration was supporting plans for a European Defence Community in hopes that it would allow West Germany to undergo rearmament, consequentially enabling the U.S. to decrease the number of American troops stationed in Germany. Churchill opposed the EDC, feeling that it could not work. He also asked, unsuccessfully, for the US to commit its forces to supporting Britain in Egypt and the Middle East. This had no appeal for Truman. Truman expected the British to assist the Americans in their fight against communist forces in Korea, but felt that supporting the British in the Middle East would be assisting them in their imperialist efforts, which would do nothing to thwart communism. Truman opted not to seek re-election in 1952, and his presidency ended in January 1953. =Churchill and Eisenhower (January 1953 ‚Äì April 1955)= Eisenhower (center) sits between Churchill (left) and Bernard Montgomery at a NATO conference in October 1951. Eisenhower would be elected president just over a year later. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Churchill were both familiar with one another, as they had both been significant leaders of the Allied effort during World War II. Relations were strained, however, by Eisenhower's outrage over Churchill's half-baked attempt to set up a \\"parley at the summit\\" with Joseph Stalin. =Eden and Eisenhower (April 1955 ‚Äì January 1957)= Similarly to his predecessor, Eden had worked closely with Eisenhower during World War II. Suez Crisis When Eden took office, Gamal Abdel Nasser built up Egyptian nationalism and threatened to take control of the vital Suez Canal. Eden in 1956 made a secret agreement with France and Israel to seize control of the canal. Eisenhower had repeatedly warned Eden that the US would not accept British military intervention. When the invasion came anyway, the US denounced it at the United Nations, and used financial power to force the British to completely withdraw. Britain lost its prestige and its powerful role in Mid-Eastern affairs, to be replaced by the Americans. Eden, in poor health, was forced to retire.Keith Kyle, Suez: Britain's End of Empire in the Middle East (2003).C.C. Kingseed, Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956 (1995).Simon C. Smith, ed. Reassessing Suez 1956: New perspectives on the crisis and its aftermath (Routledge, 2016). =Macmillan and Eisenhower (January 1957 ‚Äì January 1961)= Macmillan and Eisenhower meet in March 1957 for talks in Bermuda, aiming to repair Anglo- American relationships in the aftermath of the previous year's Suez Crisis. Once he took office, Macmillan worked to undo the strain that the Special Relationship had incurred in the preceding years. Macmillan famously quipped that it was Britain's historical duty to guide the power of the US as the ancient Greeks had the Romans.Alistair Horne, Macmillan, 1894‚Äì1956: Volume I of the Official Biography (London: Macmillan, 1988), p. 160. He endeavoured to broaden the Special Relationship beyond Churchill's conception of an English- Speaking Union into a more inclusive \\"Atlantic Community\\".Christopher Coker, 'Britain and the New World Order: The Special Relationship in the 1990s', International Affairs, Vol. 68, No. 3 (Jul. 1992), p. 408. His key theme, \\"of the interdependence of the nations of the Free World and the partnership which must be maintained between Europe and the United States\\", was one that Kennedy subsequently took up.Harold Macmillan, At the End of the Day (London: Macmillan, 1973), p. 111. However, Eisenhower increased tension with the UK by sabotaging Macmillan's policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union at the May 1960 Paris summit.Nigel J. Ashton, 'Harold Macmillan and the \\"Golden Days\\" of Anglo-American Relations Revisited', Diplomatic History, Vol. 29, No. 4 (2005), pp. 696, 704. =Macmillan and Kennedy (January 1961 ‚Äì October 1963)= Macmillan and Kennedy at Key West in 1961 Kennedy was an anglophile.Christopher Sandford, Harold and Jack: The Remarkable Friendship of Prime Minister Macmillan and President Kennedy (Prometheus Books, 2014) His father had previously served as the US ambassador to the UK and his sister had been Marchioness of Hartington, whose husband was incidentally Macmillan's nephew by marriage. British intelligence assisted the US in assessing the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy appreciated Macmillan's steady leadership, and admired his Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Skybolt crisis The Special Relationship was perhaps tested the most severely by the Skybolt crisis of 1962, when Kennedy cancelled a joint project without consultation. Skybolt was a nuclear air-to-ground missile that could penetrate Soviet airspace and would extend the life of Britain's deterrent, which consisted only of free-falling hydrogen bombs. London saw cancellation as a reduction in the British nuclear deterrent. The crisis was resolved during a series of compromises that led to the Royal Navy purchasing the American UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the Resolution-class submarines to launch them.Ken Young, \\"The Skybolt Crisis of 1962: Muddle or Mischief?\\", Journal of Strategic Studies 27.4 (2004): 614-635.Myron A. Greenberg, 'Kennedy's Choice: The Skybolt Crisis Revisited', Naval War College Review, Autumn 2000.Richard E. Neustadt, Report to JFK: The Skybolt Crisis in Perspective (1999)Horne, Macmillan: Volume II, pp. 433‚Äì37. The debates over Skybolt were top secret, but tensions were exacerbated when Dean Acheson, a former Secretary of State, challenged publicly the Special Relationship and marginalised the British contribution to the Western alliance. Acheson said: A British UGM-27 Polaris missile at the Imperial War Museum in London On learning of Acheson's attack, Macmillan thundered in public: The looming collapse of the alliance between the two thermonuclear powers forced Kennedy into an about-face at the Anglo- American summit in Nassau, where he agreed to sell Polaris as a replacement for the cancelled Skybolt. Richard E. Neustadt in his official investigation concluded the crisis in the Special Relationship had erupted because \\"the president's 'Chiefs' failed to make a proper strategic assessment of Great Britain's intentions and its capabilities\\".Greenberg, 'Kennedy's Choice'. The Skybolt crisis with Kennedy came on top of Eisenhower's wrecking of Macmillan's policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union at the May 1960 Paris summit, and the prime minister's resulting disenchantment with the Special Relationship contributed to his decision to seek an alternative in British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC). According to a recent analyst: \\"What the prime minister in effect adopted was a hedging strategy in which ties with Washington would be maintained while at the same time a new power base in Europe was sought.\\"Ashton, Anglo-American Relations Revisited, p. 705. Even so, Kennedy assured Macmillan \\"that relations between the United States and the UK would be strengthened not weakened, if the UK moved towards membership.\\"David Reynolds, \\"A 'Special Relationship'? America, Britain and the International Order Since the Second World War\\", International Affairs, Vol. 62, No. 1 (Winter, 1985‚Äì1986), p. 14. =Douglas-Home and Kennedy (October ‚Äì November 1963)= Kennedy hosts (then-Foreign Secretary) Douglas- Home at the White House in 1962 Jacqueline and his brother Ted at a reception in the White House Cross Hall following Kennedy's state funeral. Alec Douglas-Home only entered the race to replace the resigning Macmillan as Leader of the Conservative Party after learning from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Quintin Hogg being Prime Minister. Douglas-Home, however, would only serve as Prime Minister for a little over a month before Kennedy was assassinated. In England, Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 caused a profound shock and sadness expressed by many politicians, religious leaders, and luminaries of literature and the arts. The Archbishop of Canterbury led a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral. Sir Laurence Olivier at the end of his next performance called for a moment of silence, followed by a playing of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". Prime Minister Douglas-Home led parliamentary tributes to Kennedy, whom he called, \\"the most loyal and faithful of allies.\\"Robert Cook and Clive Webb. \\"Unraveling the special relationship: British responses to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\\" The Sixties 8#2 (2015): 179‚Äì194, quote p . Douglas-Home was visibly upset during his remarks, as he was truly saddened by Kennedy's death. He had liked Kennedy, and had begun to establish a positive working relationship with him.\\"Carried the hopes of the world\\", The Guardian, 23 November 1963, p. 3 After his assassination, the British government sought approval to build a memorial to President Kennedy, in part to demonstrate the strength of the Special Relationship. However, the weak popular response to its ambitious fundraising campaign was a surprise, and suggested a grassroots opposition to the late president, his policies and the US. =Douglas-Home and Johnson (November 1963 ‚Äì October 1964)= Blue Room of the White House Douglas-Home had a far more terse relationship with Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson. Douglas-Home failed to develop a good relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement on the question of British trade with Cuba.Hurd, Douglas \\"Home, Alexander Frederick Douglas-, fourteenth earl of Home and Baron Home of the Hirsel (1903‚Äì1995)\\",Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 April 2012 Relations between the two nations worsened after British Leyland busses were sold to Cuba, thus undermining the effectiveness of the United States embargo against Cuba. Douglas-Home's Conservative Party lost the 1964 general election, thus he lost his position as Prime Minister. He had only served as Prime Minister for 363 days, the U.K.'s second shortest premiership of the twentieth century. Despite its unusual brevity (and due to the assassination of Kennedy), Douglas-Home's tenure had overlapped with two US presidencies. =Wilson and Johnson (October 1964 ‚Äì January 1969)= Wilson and Johnson meet at the White House in 1966 Prime Minister Harold Wilson recast the alliance as a \\"close relationship\\",Reynolds, \\"A 'Special Relationship'?\\", p. 1. but neither he nor President Lyndon B.

However, relations were sustained by U.S. recognition that Wilson was being criticised at home by his neutralist Labour left for not condemning American involvement in the war.O'Hara, Review, p. 482.Ashton, Anglo-American Relations Revisited, p. 694. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara asked Britain to send troops to Vietnam as \\"the unwritten terms of the Special Relationship\\",Ben Macintyre, \\"Blair's real special relationship is with us, not the US\\", The Times (7 September 2002), p. 22. Wilson agreed to help in many ways but refused to commit regular forces, only special forces instructors.

The United Kingdom's subsequent withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and East Asia surprised Washington, where it was strongly opposed because British forces were valued for their contribution.Reynolds, pp. 14‚Äì15. In retrospect Wilson's moves to scale back Britain's global commitments and correct its balance of payments contrasted with Johnson's overexertions which accelerated the relative economic and military decline of the US. =Wilson and Nixon (January 1969 ‚Äì June 1970)= Wilson visiting the White House in January 1970 By the time Richard Nixon had taken office, many issues of tension between the two nations had been resolved. This allowed for the Special Relationship to blossom. In a speech delivered on 27 January 1970 at a state dinner welcoming the Prime Minister in his visit to the US Nixon said, =Heath and Nixon (June 1970 ‚Äì March 1974)= Prime Minister Edward Heath and Queen Elizabeth II with President Richard M.

A12. The Heath‚ÄìNixon era was dominated by the United Kingdom's 1973 entry into the European Economic Community (EEC). Although the two leaders' 1971 Bermuda communiqu√© restated that entry served the interests of the Atlantic Alliance, American observers voiced concern that the British government's membership would impair its role as an honest broker, and that, because of the European goal of political union, the Special Relationship would only survive if it included the whole Community.Editorial, The New York Times (24 December 1971), p. 24, col. 1. Critics accused President Nixon of impeding the EEC's inclusion in the Special Relationship by his economic policy,The New York Times (24 December 1971). which dismantled the postwar international monetary system and sought to force open European markets for US exports.Allen J. Matusow, 'Richard Nixon and the Failed War Against the Trading World', Diplomatic History, vol. 7, no. 5 (November 2003), pp. 767‚Äì8. Detractors also slated the personal relationship at the top as \\"decidedly less than special\\"; Prime Minister Edward Heath, it was alleged, \\"hardly dared put through a phone call to Richard Nixon for fear of offending his new Common Market partners.\\"Henrik Bering-Jensen, \\"Hawks of a Feather\\", Washington Times (8 April 1991), p. 2. The Special Relationship was \\"soured\\" during the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of 1973 when Nixon failed to inform Heath that US forces had been put on DEFCON 3 in a worldwide standoff with the Soviet Union, and US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger misled the British ambassador over the nuclear alert.Paul Reynolds, UK in dark over 1973 nuclear alert, BBC News (2 January 2004). Retrieved 16 March 2009. Heath, who learned about the alert only from press reports hours later, confessed: \\"I have found considerable alarm as to what use the Americans would have been able to make of their forces here without in any way consulting us or considering the British interests.\\"\\"America 'misled Britain' in Cold War; National archives: 1973\\", The Times (1 January 2004), p. 10.

Wilson held Nixon in high regards. After he left office himself, Wilson praised Nixon as America's \\"most able\\" president. =Wilson and Ford (August 1974 ‚Äì April 1976)= Wilson and Ford in the White House Rose Garden in January 1975 Gerald Ford became president after Nixon's resignation. In a toast to Wilson at a January 1975 state dinner, Ford remarked, =Callaghan and Ford (April 1976 ‚Äì January 1977)= Callaghan and Ford sitting at the Oval Office fireplace In April 1976, James Callaghan became Prime Minister after Wilson resigned the office. While President Ford never visited the United Kingdom during his presidency,'Thatcher Hero and the Leader of Free World Basks in Glory', The Guardian (25 November 1995), p. 8. the British government saw the U.S. bicentennial in 1976 as an occasion to celebrate the Special Relationship. Political leaders and guests from both sides of the Atlantic gathered in May at Westminster Hall to mark the American Declaration of Independence of 1776. Prime Minister Callaghan presented a visiting Congressional delegation with a gold-embossed reproduction of Magna Carta, symbolising the common heritage of the two nations. British historian Esmond Wright noted \\"a vast amount of popular identification with the American story\\". A year of cultural exchanges and exhibitions culminated in July in a state visit to the United States by the Queen.Robert B. Semple, Jr, \\"British Government Puts on its Biggest Single Show of Year to Mark Declaration of Independence\\", The New York Times (27 May 1976), p. 1, col. 2. Ford lost the 1976 election. Consequentially, his presidency ended in January 1977. =Callaghan and Carter (January 1977 ‚Äì May 1979)= President Jimmy Carter (left) and Prime Minister James Callaghan (right) in the Oval Office in March 1978 After defeating the incumbent Gerald Ford in the 1976 election, Jimmy Carter was sworn in as President of the United States in January 1977. Ties between Callaghan and Carter were cordial but, with both left of centre governments being preoccupied with economic malaise, diplomatic contacts remained low key. US officials characterised relations in 1978 as \\"extremely good\\", with the main disagreement being over trans-Atlantic air routes.'Callaghan set to see Carter about recession', Globe and Mail (16 March 1978), p. 12. The economic malaise that Callaghan was facing at home developed into the \\"Winter of Discontent\\", which ultimately led to Callaghan's Labour Party losing the May 1979 general election, thus ending his tenure as Prime Minister. =Thatcher and Carter (May 1979 ‚Äì January 1981)= Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter hosting a state dinner for Margaret Thatcher at the White House during her 1979 visit to the United States Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister after her party won the general election in 1979. Relations between President Carter and Prime Minister Thatcher during the year-and-a-half overlap of their leadership have often been seen as relatively cold, especially when contrasted with the kinship that Thatcher would subsequently develop with Carter's successor Ronald Reagan. However, Carter's relationship with Thatcher never reached the levels of strain that Reagan's relationship would in the midst of the Falklands War. Thatcher and Carter had clear differences in their political ideology. They both occupied relatively opposing ends of the political spectrum. By the time she had become Prime Minister, Thatcher had already met Carter on two previous occasions. Both of these encounters had initially left Carter with a negative impression of her. However, his opinion of Thatcher had reportedly become more placid by the time she was elected Prime Minister. Despite the tensions between the two, historian Chris Collins (of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation) has stated, \\"Carter is somebody she worked hard to get along with. She had considerable success at it. Had Carter lasted two terms we might be writing about the surprising amount of common ground between the two.\\" Carter congratulated Thatcher in a phone call after her party's victory in the general election (which elevated her to the office of Prime Minister), stating that the United States would, \\"look forward to working with you on an official basis.\\" However, his congratulations was delivered with an audibly unenthusiastic tone. In her first full letter to Carter, Thatcher voiced her assurance of full support in the ratification of the SALT II nuclear arms treaty writing, \\"We will do all we can to assist you\\". Shortly after her election, following her first meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (which she would describe as, \\"profoundly disheartening\\"), Thatcher expressed her concerns to Carter about the issue of Israeli settlements stating, \\"I emphasized to Mr. Begin the danger which continued expansion of Israeli settlements represents to the autonomy negotiations‚Ä¶ but he will not listen and even resents the subject of settlements being raised at all.\\" Both leaders were mutually facing great pressures during the overlap of their tenures as a national leader. Both of their nations were experiencing economic crisis due to the early 1980s recession. In addition, there was international upheaval in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Among the areas of turmoil were Afghanistan (due to the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War) and Iran (where Carter was facing a hostage crisis following the Iranian Revolution).Records of the Prime Minister's Office, Correspondence & Papers; 1979‚Äì1997 at discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk: IRAN.

Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7; access date=11 June 2017 Carter with Thatcher having tea at the White House during her 1979 visit to the United States Both Carter and Thatcher condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. They expressed concern to each other that other European nations were being too soft towards the Russians. Carter hoped that she could persuade other European nations to condemn the invasion. However, with a particularly tumultuous economic situation at home, and with most NATO members reluctant to cut trade ties with the USSR, Thatcher would only provide very weak support to Carter's efforts to punish the USSR through economic sanctions.Daniel James Lahey, \\"The Thatcher government's response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 1979‚Äì1980\\", Cold War History (2013) 13#1 pp. 21‚Äì42. Thatcher was concerned that Carter was naive about Soviet relations. Nevertheless, Thatcher played a (perhaps pivotal) role in fulfilling Carter's desire for the U.N. adoption of a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Thatcher also encouraged British athletes to participate in the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which Carter initiated in response to the invasion. However, Thatcher ultimately gave the country's Olympic Committee and individual athletes the choice to decide whether or not they would boycott the games. The United Kingdom ended up participating in the 1980 games, albeit with a smaller delegation due to individual athletes deciding to participate in boycotting the games. In their correspondences, Thatcher expressed sympathy to Carter's troubled efforts to resolve the hostage crisis in Iran. However, she outright refused his request for her to decrease the presence of the British embassy in Iran. Thatcher provided Carter with praise on his handling of the US economy, sending him a letter endorsing his measures in handling economic inflation and in cutting gas consumption during the 1979 energy crisis as, \\"painful but necessary\\". In October 1979 Thatcher wrote Carter, \\"I share your concern about Cuban and Soviet intentions in the Caribbean. This danger exists more widely in the developing world. It is essential that the Soviet Union should recognise your resolve in this matter. [‚Ä¶] I am therefore especially encouraged by your statement that you are accelerating efforts to increase the capability of the United States to use its military forces world wide.\\" Also October 1979 there was a dispute over Thatcher's government's provision of funding for BBC's external services. In desperation, the BBC contacted United States Ambassador Kingman Brewster Jr. to request that the US government endorse them in their fight against spending cuts. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski discussed this request with the State Department, and even drafted a letter for Carter to send Thatcher. However, Brzezinski ultimately decided against advising Carter to involve himself in the BBC's efforts to lobby against budget cuts. During her December 1979 visit to the United States, Thatcher chastised Carter for not permitting the sale of arsenal to equip the Royal Ulster Constabulary. During this visit, she delivered a speech in which a lack of warmth towards Carter was evident. While Thatcher likely favoured her ideological counterpart Ronald Reagan to win the 1980 election (in which he defeated Carter), she was cautious to avoid voicing any such preference, even in private. =Thatcher and Reagan (January 1981 ‚Äì January 1989)= President Ronald Reagan (left) and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (right) in Bonn, May 1985 The personal friendship between President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher united them as \\"ideological soul- mates\\". They shared a commitment to the philosophy of the free market, low taxes, limited government, and a strong defence; they rejected d√©tente and were determined to win the Cold War with the Soviet Union. However, they did have disagreements on internal social policies such as the AIDS epidemic and abortion.Geoffrey Smith, Reagan and Thatcher (Vintage, 1990).Anthony Andrew Clark, \\"Were Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan Inseparable Political Allies?.\\" History in the Making 2#2 (2013): 21‚Äì29. Thatcher summed up her understanding of the Special Relationship at her first meeting with Reagan as president in 1981: \\"Your problems will be our problems and when you look for friends we shall be there.\\" Celebrating the 200th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 1985, Thatcher enthused: Reagan, in turn, acknowledged: In 1982, Thatcher and Reagan reached an agreement to replace the British Polaris fleet with a force equipped with US-supplied Trident missiles. The confidence between the two principals appeared momentarily strained by Reagan's belated support in the Falklands War, but this was more than countered by the Anglophile American Defense Secretary, Caspar Weinberger, who provided strong support in intelligence and munitions. It has since been revealed that while publicly claiming neutrality in the dispute between Argentina and Britain over the Falkland Islands, Reagan had approved a top-secret plan to loan a U.S. aircraft carrier to the British in the event that Argentine forces managed to sink one of the British carriers, and had told Weinberger to: \\"Give Maggie everything she needs to get on with it.\\" A July 2012 article by USNI News of the United States Naval Institute revealed that the Reagan Administration offered the use of the USS Iwo Jima as a replacement in case either of the two British carriers, and , had been damaged or destroyed during the 1982 Falklands War. This top-secret contingency plan was revealed to the staff of the Naval Institute by John Lehman, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy at the time of the Falklands War, from a speech provided to the Naval Institute that Lehman made in Portsmouth, UK on 26 June 2012. Lehman stated that the loan of Iwo Jima was made in response to a request from the Royal Navy, and it had the endorsement of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. The actual planning for the loan of Iwo Jima was done by the staff of the U.S. Second Fleet under the direction of Vice Admiral James Lyons, who confirmed Lehman's revelations with the Naval Institute staff. Contingency planning envisioned American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge of Iwo Jimas systems, assisting the British in manning the U.S. helicopter carrier during the loan-out. Naval analyst Eric Wertheim compared this arrangement to the Flying Tigers. Significantly, except for U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the U.S. Department of State was not included in the loan-out negotiations. An American F-111F takes off from RAF Lakenheath to conduct an airstrike in Libya on 15 April 1986. In 1986 Washington asked permission to use British airbases in order to bomb Libya in retaliation for the 1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing by Libyan terrorists that killed two U.S. servicemen. The British cabinet was opposed and Thatcher herself was worried it would lead to widespread attacks on British interests in the Middle East. That did not happen, and instead Libyan terrorism fell off sharply. Furthermore, although British public opinion was highly negative, Britain won widespread praise in the United States at a time when Spain and France had vetoed American requests to fly over their territories.John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady vol. 2 (2003) pp. 279‚Äì82. online A more serious disagreement came in 1983 when Washington did not consult with London on the invasion of Grenada.Gary Williams, \\"'A Matter of Regret': Britain, the 1983 Grendada Crisis, and the Special Relationship\\", Twentieth Century British History 12#2 (2001): 208‚Äì230. Grenada is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and, following the invasion, it requested help from other Commonwealth members. The intervention was opposed by Commonwealth members including the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada, among others. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a close ally of Reagan on other matters, personally opposed the U.S. invasion. Reagan told her it might happen; she did not know for sure it was coming until three hours before. At 12:30 on the morning of the invasion, Thatcher sent a message to Reagan: Reagan told Thatcher before anyone else that the invasion would begin in a few hours, but ignored her complaints. She publicly supported the U.S. action. Reagan phoned to apologize for the miscommunication, and the long-term friendly relationship endured.John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher Volume Two: The Iron Lady (2011) pp. 273‚Äì79.Gary Williams, \\"'A Matter of Regret': Britain, the 1983 Grenada Crisis, and the Special Relationship\\", Twentieth Century British History 12#2 (2001): 208‚Äì30. In 1986, the British defence secretary Michael Heseltine, a prominent critic of the Special Relationship and a supporter of European integration, resigned over his concern that a takeover of Britain's last helicopter manufacturer by a US firm would harm the British defence industry.John Dumbrell, A Special Relationship: Anglo-American Relations in the Cold War and After (Basingstoke, Hants: Macmillan, 2001), pp. 97‚Äì99. Thatcher herself also saw a potential risk to Britain's deterrent and security posed by the Strategic Defense InitiativeMargaret Thatcher, The Downing Street Years, (London: HarperCollins, 1993), pp. 465‚Äì6. She was alarmed at Reagan's proposal at the Reykjav√≠k Summit to eliminate nuclear weapons, but was relieved when the proposal failed. All in all, Britain's needs figured more prominently in American thinking strategy than anyone else.Coker, 'Britain and the New World Order', p. 408. Peter Hennessy, a leading historian, singles out the personal dynamic of \\"Ron\\" and \\"Margaret\\" in this success: =Thatcher and George H. W. Bush (January 1989 ‚Äì November 1990)= Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President George H. W. Bush in London, June 1989 In his personal diary, George H. W. Bush wrote that his first impression of Thatcher was she was principled but very difficult. Bush also wrote that Thatcher, \\"talks all the time when you're in a conversation. It's a one-way street.\\" Despite having developed a warm relation with Reagan, whom Bush had served under as vice president, Thatcher never developed a similar sense of camaraderie with Bush. At the time that Bush took office in 1989, Thatcher was politically under siege from both her political opposition and forces within her own party. Bush was anxious to manage the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe in a manner that would produce order and stability. Bush therefore used a 1989 trip to Brussels to demonstrate the heightened attention that his administration planned to allocate towards US‚ÄìGerman relations. Thus, rather than giving Thatcher the precedence which Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom were accustomed to receiving from US Presidents, he met with the president of the European Commission first, leaving Thatcher, \\"cooling her heels\\". This irritated Thatcher. In 1989, after Bush proposed a reduction in US troops stationed in Europe, Thatcher lectured Bush on the importance of freedom. Bush came out of this encounter asking, \\"Why does she have any doubt that we feel this way on this issue?\\" In the midst of the invasion of Kuwait, Thatcher advised Bush that, \\"this is no time to go wobbly.\\" Thatcher lost her premiership in November 1990. However, to Bush's displeasure, she continued attempting to involve herself in diplomacy between the West and the Soviet Union. Bush took particular offence to a speech Thatcher gave after leaving office in which she said that she and Ronald Reagan were responsible for ending the Cold War. Thatcher gave this speech, which snubbed the contributions that others had made, before an audience that included a number of individuals who had contributed to the ending the Cold War, such as Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and V√°clav Havel. In reaction to this speech, Helmut Kohl sent Bush a note proclaiming that Thatcher was crazy. =Major and George H. W.

Bush (right) at Camp David in June 1992 As had started becoming apparent in Thatcher's last few years of premiership, the Special Relationship had begun to wane for a time with the passing of the Cold War, despite intensive co-operation in the Gulf War. Thus, while it remained the case that \\"On almost all issues, Britain and the US are on the same side of the table. You cannot say that for other important allies such as France, Germany or Japan\\",Martin Fletcher and Michael Binyon, 'Special Relationship Struggles to Bridge the Generation Gap‚ÄîAnglo-American', The Times (22 December 1993). it was also acknowledged that \\"The disappearance of a powerful common threat, the Soviet Union, has allowed narrower disputes to emerge and given them greater weight.\\"\\"British-American Strains\\", The New York Times (25 March 1995), p. 22. =Major and Clinton (January 1993 ‚Äì May 1997)= President Bill Clinton (left) and Prime Minister John Major (right) hold a working breakfast at the White House in 1994. Republican administrations had typically worked well with Conservative governments, and the new Democratic President Bill Clinton intended to maintain the Special Relationship. But he and Major did not prove compatible. The nuclear alliance was weakened when Clinton extended a moratorium on tests in the Nevada desert in 1993, and pressed Major to agree to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Martin Walker, 'President puts Britain's deterrent in melting pot', The Guardian (24 February 1993), p. 1. The freeze was described by a British defence minister as \\"unfortunate and misguided\\", as it inhibited validation of the \\"safety, reliability and effectiveness\\" of fail-safe mechanisms on upgraded warheads for the British Trident II D5 missiles, and potentially the development of a new deterrent for the 21st century, leading Major to consider a return to Pacific Ocean testing.Graham Barrett, 'UK Eyes Nuclear Testing In Pacific', The Age (5 July 1993), p. 8.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher's campaign to lift the embargo was rebuffed by Major and President Mitterrand in May 1993. After the so-called 'Copenhagen ambush' in June 1993, where Clinton \\"ganged up\\" with Chancellor Kohl to rally the European Community against the peacekeeping states, Major was said to be contemplating the death of the Special Relationship. The following month the United States voted at the UN with non-aligned countries against Britain and France over lifting the embargo.Robi Dutta, \\"Bridging Troubled Waters ‚Äì Chronology ‚Äì US Foreign Policy\\", The Times (19 October 1993). By October 1993, Warren Christopher was bristling that Washington policy makers had been too \\"Eurocentric\\", and declared that Western Europe was \\"no longer the dominant area of the world\\". The U.S. ambassador to London, Raymond G.H. Seitz, demurred, insisting it was far too early to put a \\"tombstone\\" over the Special Relationship. A senior U.S. State Department official described Bosnia in the spring of 1995 as the worst crisis with the British and French since Suez.Walker, \\"Why Bill Won't Give Up His Respect for Major\\", p. 21. By the summer, U.S. officials were doubting whether NATO had a future. The nadir had now been reached, and, along with NATO enlargement and the Croatian offensive in 1995 that opened the way for NATO bombing, the strengthening Clinton‚ÄìMajor relationship was later credited as one of three developments that saved the Western alliance. The president later acknowledged, A rift opened in a further area. In February 1994, Major refused to answer Clinton's telephone calls for days over his decision to grant Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams a visa to visit the United States to agitate. Adams was listed as a terrorist by London.Villa, \\"The Reagan‚ÄìThatcher 'special relationship' has not weathered the years\\".

To the disappointment of the prime minister, Clinton lifted the ban on official contacts and received Adams at the White House on St. Patrick's Day 1995, despite the fact the paramilitaries had not agreed to disarm. The rows over Northern Ireland and the Adams affair reportedly \\"provoked incandescent Clintonian rages\\". In November 1995, Clinton became only the second US president ever to address both Houses of Parliament, but, by the end of Major's premiership, disenchantment with the Special Relationship had deepened to the point where the incoming British ambassador Christopher Meyer banned the \\"hackneyed phrase\\" from the embassy.Walker, \\"Why Bill Won't Give Up His Respect for Major\\", p. 21Jasper Gerar, Ultimate insider prowls into the outside world, The Sunday Times (1 June 2003).

Despite their political differences on non-strategic matters, their shared beliefs and responses to the international situation formed a commonality of purpose following the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. Blair, like Bush, was convinced of the importance of moving against the perceived threat to world peace and international order, famously pledging to stand \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" with Bush: Blair flew to Washington immediately after 9/11 to affirm British solidarity with the United States.

On 20 July, Cameron met with Obama during his first visit to the United States as prime minister. The two expressed unity in a wide range of issues, including the war in Afghanistan. During the meeting, Obama stated, \\"We can never say it enough.

Obama maintained his stance that the UK would be a low priority for US trade talks post-Brexit, and that the UK would be at \\"the back of the queue\\". May chose Boris Johnson to serve as her Foreign Secretary. Johnson had written an op-ed which made mention of Obama's Kenyan heritage in a manner which critics accused of being racist. He had also previously written an op-ed about Hillary Clinton which made derisive statements that had been criticized as sexist. By the time May appointed Johnson, Clinton was the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee in the election to elect Obama's successor, and thus had a significant chance of being the next US president. A senior official in the US government suggested that Johnson's appointment would push the US further towards ties with Germany at the expense of the Special Relationship with the UK. Ultimately, before he left office, Obama stated that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his \\"closest international partner\\" throughout his tenure as president. While Obama might have had a distant relationship with Prime Minister May, he reportedly maintained a strong cordial relationship with members of the British royal family. =May and Trump (January 2017 ‚Äì July 2019)= May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump following his inauguration. Following the election of Donald Trump, the British government has sought to establish a close alliance with the Trump administration. May's efforts to closely associate herself with Trump proved to be strongly controversial in the United Kingdom. May was the first world leader to meet with Trump following his inauguration. May's supporters described her visit as a bid to reaffirm the historical \\"special relationship\\" between the two countries. The meeting took place at the White House and lasted about an hour. May was criticized in the UK by members of all major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Trump's \\"Muslim ban\\" executive order. as well as for her invitation to Trump, extended in 2017, for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. An invitation for a state visit had not traditionally been extended so early in a presidency, however May did so in hopes of fostering a stronger trade relationship with the United States before the Brexit deadline. More than 1.8 million signed an official parliamentary e-petition which said that \\"Donald Trump's well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,\\" and Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition Labour Party, said in Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) that Trump should not be welcomed to Britain \\"while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees' and women's rights\\" and said that Trump should be banned from the UK until his travel ban is lifted. Baroness Warsi, former chair of the Conservatives, accused May of \\"bowing down\\" to Trump, who she described as \\"a man who has no respect for women, disdain for minorities, little value for LGBT communities, no compassion clearly for the vulnerable and whose policies are rooted in divisive rhetoric.\\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, also called for the visit to be cancelled. Trump's invitation was later downgraded to a \\"working visit\\" rather than a \\"state visit\\"; the visit occurred in July 2018 and included a meeting with the queen, but not the ceremonies and events of a full state visit. Despite May's efforts to establish a beneficial working relationship with Trump, their relationship had been described as \\"dysfunctional\\". It had been reported that, in their phone calls, Trump has made a habit of interrupting May. In November 2017, Trump retweeted an anti-Muslim post from the far-right group Britain First. The move was condemned across the British political spectrum, and May said through a spokesperson that it was \\"wrong of the president to have done this.\\" In response, Trump tweeted, \\"Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom, We are doing just fine!\\" The dispute between Trump and May weakened the perception of a strong \\"special relationship\\" under May's leadership and undermined her efforts to craft an image of a close relationship with the United States in order to ease the passage of Brexit. Some viewed Trump's tweets as causing significant harm to the Special Relationship. In February 2018, Trump--in an attempt to rebuke a push by some in the U.S. Democratic Party for universal healthcare--tweeted that, \\"thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working\\". Trump's criticism of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) was factually inaccurate; the protests in the UK that Trump referenced actually pushed for an improvement in NHS services and increases in NHS funding, and were not in opposition to the NHS or to Britain's universal healthcare system. The tweet furthered strained the Trump-May relationship, and May responded by declaring her pride in the UK's health system. In January 2018, in a televised interview with Piers Morgan, Trump criticized May's approach to Brexit negotiations, furthering straining his relationship with her. At the 2018 G7 summit, Trump repeatedly made apparent slights towards May. Despite this, May stated that her relationship with Trump remained strong. At the 2018 Brussels summit, May sought to curry favor with Trump by supporting his complaints that other NATO members had failing to meet certain levels of defense funding. Following the Brussels summit, Trump made his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom. His visit came at period in the United Kingdom's political climate which had been preceded by significant tumult for May. She was receiving significant resistance to her plans for a \\"soft Brexit\\", which had resulted several major resignations amongst her cabinet ministers. During his visit, in an interview with The Sun, Trump spoke critically of May's handling of Brexit negotiations. He stated that May's proposal would likely kill the prospects of a US-UK trade agreement. These comments inflicted further damage on an already-embattled May. Trump also praised Boris Johnson (a political rival of May's who had recently resigned from her cabinet), going as far to suggest that Johnson would make a good prime minister. Vanity Fair considered that the \\"special relationship\\" had \\"devolved into a greasy dumpster fire\\" under Trump and May. Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were further strained in 2019, after a number of confidential diplomatic cables authored by the British Ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, were leaked to the Mail on Sunday. In the cables to the Foreign Office, which dated from 2017 to 2019, Darroch reported that the Trump administration as \\"uniquely dysfunctional\\" and \\"inept\\" and that Trump was \\"radiates insecurity\\"; the cables advised U.S. officials that dealing with Trump required them \\"you need to make your points simple, even blunt.\\" Darroch also wrote that Trump's position toward Iran frequently changed, likely to political considerations. After the memos leaked, Trump said that Darroch \\"has not served the UK well\\" and criticizing May. May defended Darroch, stating that \\"Good government depends on public servants being able to give full and frank advice\\"; other British politicians, such as Nigel Farage and Liam Fox, criticized Darroch. Following Boris Johnson's refusal to defend Darroch in a debate for the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election and Trump's statement that he would refuse to deal with Darroch, the ambassador resigned. Both May and Corbyn praised Darroch's service in the House of Commons and deplored that he had to resign under pressure from the United States. =Johnson and Trump (July 2019 ‚Äì present)= Prime Minister Boris Johnson (left) speaking with US President Donald Trump (right) at the 45th G7 summit, August 2019 After May resigned, Boris Johnson won the leadership contest with Trump's endorsement, and became Prime Minister. Trump praised Johnson as Prime Minister and celebrated comparisons that had been made between Johnson and himself, declaring, \\"Good man. He's tough and he's smart. They're saying 'Britain Trump.' They call him 'Britain Trump,' and there's people saying that's a good thing.\\" At the start of November, as the UK prepared for the start of its 2019 general election campaign, Trump threw his support behind Johnson and the Conservative Party, telling London radio station LBC that a government led by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party would be \\"so bad for your country ... he'd take you into such bad places.\\" In the same interview, Trump praised Johnson as, \\"a fantastic man\\", and, \\"the exact right guy for the times\\". Trump also praised Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, and called for him and Johnson to collaborate on delivering Brexit. During the election campaign, Johnson had been seen as being keen on distancing himself from Trump, who is greatly unpopular in the UK. At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, Johnson was caught on-camera appearing to participate in mocking Trump in a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Anne, Princess Royal. After the video was publicized, Trump criticized Trudeau as \\"two-faced\\" but did not criticize Johnson or other leaders. Public opinion It has been noted that secret defence and intelligence links \\"that [have] minimal impact on ordinary people [play] a disproportionate role in the transatlantic friendship\\",Editorial ‚Äì Bill and Tony ‚Äì New Best Friends', The Guardian (30 May 1997), p. 18. and perspectives on the Special Relationship differ. =Poll findings= A 1942 Gallup poll conducted after Pearl Harbor, before the arrival of U.S. troops and Churchill's heavy promotion of the Special Relationship, showed the wartime ally of the USSR was still more popular than the United States among 62% of Britons. However, only 6% had ever visited the United States and only 35% knew any Americans personally.Harry Blaney III and Julia Moore, 'Britain Doubtful of American Intentions, Poll Shows', Dallas Morning News (17 February 1986), p. 15A. In 1969, the United States was tied with the Commonwealth as the most important overseas connection for the British public, while Europe came in a distant third. By 1984, after a decade in the Common Market, Britons chose Europe as being most important to them.Blaney and Moore, 'Britain Doubtful', p. 15A. British opinion polls from the Cold War revealed ambivalent feelings towards the United States. Margaret Thatcher's 1979 agreement to base US cruise missiles in Britain was approved of by only 36% of Britons, and the number with little or no trust in the ability of the US to deal wisely with world affairs had soared from 38% in 1977 to 74% in 1984, by which time 49% wanted US nuclear bases in Britain removed, and 50% would have sent US-controlled cruise missiles back to the United States. At the same time, 59% of Britons supported their own country's nuclear deterrent, with 60% believing Britain should rely on both nuclear and conventional weapons, and 66% opposing unilateral nuclear disarmament. 53% of Britons opposed dismantling the Royal Navy's Polaris submarines. 70% of Britons still considered Americans to be very or fairly trustworthy, and in case of war the United States was the ally trusted overwhelmingly to come to Britain's aid, and to risk its own security for the sake of Britain. The United States and Britain were also the two countries most alike in basic values such as willingness to fight for their country and the importance of freedom. In 1986, 71% of Britons, questioned in a Mori poll the day after Ronald Reagan's bombing of Libya, disagreed with Thatcher's decision to allow the use of RAF bases, while two thirds in a Gallup survey opposed the bombing itself, the inverse of US opinion.Fiona Thompson, 'US Policies Breed Special Relationship Of Resentment / Increasing criticism of British Premier Thatcher's support for Reagan administration', Financial Times (11 November 1986). Anti-war protest in Trafalgar Square, February 2007 The United Kingdom's all-time low poll rating in the United States came in 1994, during the split over Bosnia, when 56% of Americans interviewed considered Britons to be close allies.Nihal Kaneira, 'Canada still tops list of US allies ‚Äì poll', Gulf News (21 September 1997).Tunku Varadarajan, 'Britain's place in US hearts secure', The Times (18 September 1997), p. 19. In a 1997 Harris poll published after Tony Blair's election, 63% of people in the United States viewed Britain as a close ally, up by one percent from 1996, 'confirming that the long- running \\"special relationship\\" with America's transatlantic cousins is still alive and well'.Kaneira, 'poll'. Britain came second behind its colonial offshoot Canada, on 73%, while another offshoot, Australia, came third, on 48%.Varadarajan, 'Britain's place secure', p. 19. Popular awareness of the historical link was fading in the parent country, however. In a 1997 Gallup poll, while 60% of the British public said they regretted the end of Empire and 70% expressed pride in the imperial past, 53% wrongly supposed that the United States had never been a British possession.'(Mis)remembrances of Empire', Wall Street Journal (29 August 1997), p. 6. In 1998, 61% of Britons polled by ICM said they believed they had more in common with US citizens than they did with the rest of Europe. 64% disagreed with the sentence 'Britain does what the US government tells us to do.' A majority also backed Blair's support of Bill Clinton's strategy on Iraq, 42% saying action should be taken to topple Saddam Hussein, with 24% favouring diplomatic action, and a further 24%, military action. A majority of Britons aged 24 and over said they did not like Blair supporting Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal.Orya Sultan Halisdemir, 'British deny they are US puppets', Turkish Daily News (14 February 1998). A 2006 poll of the US public showed that the United Kingdom, as an 'ally in the war on terror' was viewed more positively than any other country. 76% of the US people polled viewed the British as an 'ally in the War on Terror' according to Rasmussen Reports. According to Harris Interactive, 74% of Americans viewed Great Britain as a 'close ally in the war in Iraq', well ahead of next-ranked Canada at 48%. A June 2006 poll by Populus for The Times showed that the number of Britons agreeing that 'it is important for Britain's long-term security that we have a close and special relationship with America' had fallen to 58% (from 71% in April), and that 65% believed that 'Britain's future lies more with Europe than America.'Populus poll 2‚Äì4 June 2006 Only 44%, however, agreed that 'America is a force for good in the world.' A later poll during the Israel-Lebanon conflict found that 63% of Britons felt that the United Kingdom was tied too closely to the United States.Stand up to US, voters tell Blair, The Guardian (25 July 2006). A 2008 poll by The Economist showed that Britons' views differed considerably from Americans' views when asked about the topics of religion, values, and national interest. The Economist remarked: In January 2010 a Leflein poll conducted for Atlantic Bridge found that 57% of people in the US considered the special relationship with Britain to be the world's most important bilateral partnership, with 2% disagreeing. 60% of people in the US regarded Britain as the country most likely to support the United States in a crisis, while Canada came second on 24%, and Australia third on 4%.Amanda Bowman, What Britain's changing of the guard will mean for the U.S., Washington Examiner (7 April 2010).Americans Overwhelmingly Support the Special Relationship Between the US and the UK , Atlantic Bridge, 2010. In May 2010, a poll conducted in the UK by YouGov revealed that 66% of those surveyed held a favourable view of the US and 62% agreed with the assertion that America is Britain's most important ally. However, the survey also revealed that 85% of British citizens believe that the UK has little or no influence on American policies, and that 62% think that America does not consider British interests.Obama and the 'Special Relationship', Wall Street Journal, 19 May 2010. Another poll by YouGov in September 2016 revealed that 57% still believed in the special relationship, whilst 37% did not. =Iraq War= Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, senior British figures criticized the refusal of the US Government to heed British advice regarding post-war plans for Iraq, specifically the Coalition Provisional Authority's de-Ba'athification policy and the critical importance of preventing the power vacuum in which the insurgency subsequently developed. British defence secretary Geoff Hoon later stated that the United Kingdom 'lost the argument' with the Bush administration over rebuilding Iraq. =Extraordinary rendition= US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, September 2007 Assurances made by the United States to the United Kingdom that 'extraordinary rendition' flights had never landed on British territory were later shown to be false when official US records proved that such flights had landed at Diego Garcia repeatedly. The revelation was an embarrassment for British foreign secretary David Miliband, who apologised to Parliament. =Criminal law= In 2003, the United States pressed the United Kingdom to agree to an extradition treaty which, proponents argued, allowed for equal extradition requirements between the two countries.Ambassador Tuttle on the Extradition Treaty (12 July 2006) Embassy of the United States. Retrieved 22 March 2009.Meg Hillier, What is the US-UK Extradition Act? (24 November 2006). Retrieved 22 March 2009. Critics argued that the United Kingdom was obligated to make a strong prima facie case to US courts before extradition would be granted, and that, by contrast, extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States was a matter of administrative decision alone, without prima facie evidence.John Hardy, Letter: Bilateral extradition treaty is not equal The Times (22 January 2009). This had been implemented as an anti-terrorist measure in the wake of 11 September 2001 attacks. Very soon, however, it was being used by the United States to extradite and prosecute a number of high-profile London businessmen (e.g., the Natwest Three and Ian Norris) on fraud charges. Contrasts have been drawn with the United States' harboring of Provisional IRA terrorists in the 1970s through to the 1990s and repeated refusals to extradite them to the UK. On 30 September 2006, the US Senate unanimously ratified the 2003 treaty. Ratification had been slowed by complaints from some Irish-American groups that the treaty would create new legal jeopardy for US citizens who opposed British policy in Northern Ireland. The Spectator condemned the three-year delay as 'an appalling breach in a long-treasured relationship'.'Suspend the treaty now', The Spectator (8 July 2006). The United States also refused to accede to another priority of the Blair government, the treaty setting-up the International Criminal Court.The Court That Tries American's Patience, The Daily Telegraph report =Trade policy= Trade disputes and attendant job fears have sometimes strained the Special Relationship. The United States has been accused of pursuing an aggressive trade policy, using or ignoring WTO rules; the aspects of this causing most difficulty to the United Kingdom have been a successful challenge to the protection of small family banana farmers in the West Indies from large US corporations such as the American Financial Group,Peter Clegg, From Insiders to Outsiders: Caribbean Banana Interests in the New International Trading Framework and high tariffs on British steel products. In 2002, Blair denounced Bush's imposition of tariffs on steel as 'unacceptable, unjustified and wrong', but although Britain's biggest steelmaker, Corus, called for protection from dumping by developing nations, the Confederation of British Industry urged the government not to start a 'tit-for-tat'.Peter Marsh and Robert Shrimsley, 'Blair condemns Bush's tariffs on steel imports', The Financial Times (7 March 2002), p. 3.

A barrel is one of several units of volume applied in various contexts; there are dry barrels, fluid barrels (such as the U.K. beer barrel and U.S. beer barrel), oil barrels, and so forth. For historical reasons the volumes of some barrel units are roughly double the volumes of others; volumes in common use range approximately from . In many connections the term is used almost interchangeably with barrel. Since medieval times the term as a unit of measure has had various meanings throughout Europe, ranging from about 100 litres to about 1,000 litres. The name was derived in medieval times from the French , of unknown origin, but still in use, both in French and as derivations in many other languages such as Italian, Polish and Spanish. In most countries such usage is obsolescent, increasingly superseded by SI units. As a result, the meaning of corresponding words and related concepts (vat, cask, keg etc.) in other languages often refers to a physical container rather than a known measure. In the international oil market context, however, prices in United States dollars per barrel are commonly used, and the term is variously translated, often to derivations of the Latin / Teutonic root fat (for example vat or Fass). In other commercial connections, barrel sizes such as beer keg volumes also are standardised in many countries. Dry goods in the US * US dry barrel: ( ‚âà ) **Defined as length of stave , diameter of head , distance between heads , circumference of bulge outside measurement; representing as nearly as possible 7,056 cubic inches; and the thickness of staves not greater than (diameter ‚âà ). Any barrel that is 7,056 cubic inches is recognized as equivalent. This is exactly equal to 26.25 US dry-gallons. * US barrel for cranberries ( ‚âà ) ** Defined as length of stave , diameter of head , distance between heads , circumference of bulge outside measurement; and the thickness of staves not greater than (diameter ‚âà ). No equivalent in cubic inches is given in the statute, but later regulations specify it as 5,826 cubic inches. Some products have a standard weight or volume that constitutes a barrel: * Cornmeal, * Cement (including Portland cement), or *Sugar, () * Wheat or rye flour, three bushels or * Lime (mineral), large barrel, or small barrel * Butter and cheese in UK, * Salt, Fluid barrel in the US and UK Fluid barrels vary depending on what is being measured and where. In the UK a beer barrel is . In the US most fluid barrels (apart from oil) are (half a hogshead), but a beer barrel is .27 CFR ¬ß 25.11. The size of beer kegs in the US is based loosely on fractions of the US beer barrel. When referring to beer barrels or kegs in many countries, the term may be used for the commercial package units independent of actual volume, where common range for professional use is 20‚Äì60 L, typically a DIN or Euro keg of 50 L. =History= Richard III, King of England from 1483 until 1485, had defined the wine puncheon as a cask holding 84 gallons and a wine tierce as holding 42 gallons. Custom had made the 42 gallon watertight tierce a standard container for shipping eel, salmon, herring, molasses, wine, whale oil, and many other commodities in the English colonies by 1700. After the American Revolution in 1776, American merchants continued to use the same size barrels. Oil barrel In the worldwide oil industry, an oil barrel is defined as 42 US gallons, which is about litres,1 US liquid gallon = 231 cu in and 1 inch = 25.4 mm implies exactly 158.987294928 litres. or 35 imperial gallons. Oil companies that are listed on American stock exchanges typically report their production in terms of volume and use the units bbl (one barrel), or kbbl or Mbbl (one kilobarrel, one thousand barrels), or MMbbl (one million barrels), and occasionally for wider comprehensive statistics Gbbl (or sometimes Gbl), for giga-barrel (one billion barrels). There is a conflict concerning the units for oil barrels (see ). For all other physical quantities, according to the International System of Units, the uppercase letter \\"M\\" means \\"mega-\\" (\\"one million\\"), for example: Mm (one million metres, megametres), MHz (one million hertz, or megahertz), MW (one million watts, or megawatt), MeV (one million electronvolt, or megaelectronvolt). But due to tradition, the Mbbl acronym is used today meaning \\"one thousand bbl\\", as a heritage of the roman number \\"M\\" meaning \\"one thousand\\". On the other hand, there are efforts to avoid this ambiguity, and most of the barrel dealers today prefer to use bbl, instead of Mbbl, mbbl, MMbbl or mmbbl. Outside the United States, volumes of oil are usually reported in cubic metres (m3) instead of oil barrels. Cubic metre is the basic volume unit in the International System. In Canada, oil companies measure oil in cubic metres, but convert to barrels on export, since most of Canada's oil production is exported to the US. The nominal conversion factor is 1 cubic metre = 6.2898 oil barrels, but conversion is generally done by custody transfer meters on the border, since the volumes are specified at different temperatures, and the exact conversion factor depends on both density and temperature. Canadian companies operate internally and report to Canadian governments in cubic metres, but often convert to US barrels for the benefit of American investors and oil marketers. They generally quote prices in Canadian dollars per cubic metre to other Canadian companies, but use US dollars per barrel in financial reports and press statements, making it appear to the outside world that they operate in barrels. Companies on the European stock exchanges report the mass of oil in tonnes. Since different varieties of petroleum have different densities, however, there is not a single conversion between mass and volume. For example, one tonne of heavy distillates might occupy a volume of . In contrast, one tonne of crude oil might occupy , and one tonne of gasoline will require . Overall, the conversion is usually between per tonne. =History= The measurement of an \\"oil barrel\\" originated in the early Pennsylvania oil fields. The Drake Well, the first oil well in the US, was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, and an oil boom followed in the 1860s. When oil production began, there was no standard container for oil, so oil and petroleum products were stored and transported in barrels of different shapes and sizes. Some of these barrels would originally have been used for other products, such as beer, fish, molasses, or turpentine. Both the barrels (based on the old English wine measure), the tierce (159 litres) and the whiskey barrels were used. Also, barrels were in common use. The 40 gallon whiskey barrel was the most common size used by early oil producers, since they were readily available at the time. Around 1866, early oil producers in Pennsylvania came to the conclusion that shipping oil in a variety of different containers was causing buyer distrust. They decided they needed a standard unit of measure to convince buyers that they were getting a fair volume for their money, and settled on the standard wine tierce, which was two gallons larger than the standard whisky barrel. The Weekly Register, an Oil City, Pennsylvania newspaper, stated on August 31, 1866 that \\"the oil producers have issued the following circular\\": And by that means King Richard III's English wine tierce became the American standard oil barrel. By 1872, the standard oil barrel was firmly established as 42 US-gallons. The 42 gallon standard oil barrel was officially adopted by the Petroleum Producers Association in 1872 and by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1882. In modern times, many different types of oil, chemicals, and other products are transported in steel drums. In the United States, these commonly have a capacity of and are referred to as such. They are called 210 litre or 200 kg drums outside the United States. In the United Kingdom and its former dependencies, a drum is used, even though all those countries now officially use the metric system and the drums are filled to 200 litres. Thus, the 42 US-gallon oil barrel is a unit of measure, and is no longer a physical container used to transport crude oil, as most petroleum is moved in pipelines or oil tankers. In the United States, the 42 US-gallon size of barrel as a unit of measure is largely confined to the oil industry, while different sizes of barrel are used in other industries. Nearly all other countries use the metric system. =Definitions and units= The abbreviations Mbbl and MMbbl refer to one thousand and one million barrels respectively. These are derived from the Latin \\"mille\\", meaning \\"thousand\\". This is different from the SI convention where \\"M\\" stands for the Greek \\"mega\\", meaning \\"million\\". Outside of the oil industry, the unit Mbbl (megabarrel) can sometimes stand for one million barrels. The \\"b\\" may have been doubled originally to indicate the plural (1 bl, 2 bbl), or possibly it was doubled to eliminate any confusion with bl as a symbol for the bale. Some sources assert that \\"bbl\\" originated as a symbol for \\"blue barrels\\" delivered by Standard Oil in its early days. However, while Ida Tarbell's 1904 Standard Oil Company history acknowledged the \\"holy blue barrel\\", the abbreviation \\"bbl\\" had been in use well before the 1859 birth of the U.S. petroleum industry. Oil wells recover not just oil from the ground, but also natural gas and water. The term barrels of liquid per day (BLPD) refers to the total volume of liquid that is recovered. Similarly, barrels of oil equivalent or BOE is a value that accounts for both oil and natural gas while ignoring any water that is recovered. Other terms are used when discussing only oil. These terms can refer to either the production of crude oil at an oil well, the conversion of crude oil to other products at an oil refinery, or the overall consumption of oil by a region or country. One common term is barrels per day (BPD, BOPD, bbl/d, bpd, bd, or b/d), where 1 BPD is equivalent to 0.0292 gallons per minute.BP Statistical Review 2006. One BPD also becomes 49.8 tonnes per year. At an oil refinery, production is sometimes reported as barrels per calendar day (b/cd or bcd), which is total production in a year divided by the days in that year. Likewise, barrels per stream day (BSD or BPSD) is the quantity of oil product produced by a single refining unit during continuous operation for 24 hours. Burning a barrel of light, synthetic, or heavy crude yields 38.51, 39.40, or 40.90 GJ (thermal) respectively, so 1 bpd of synthetic crude is about 450 kW (slightly less for light crude, slightly more for heavy crude). =Accuracy when converting from barrel to cubic metre= When used to denote a volume, one barrel is exactly 42 US gallons and is easily converted to any other unit of volume. As the US gallon since 1893 is defined as 3.785411784 litre, a volume of one barrel is exactly 158.987294928 litres. Using the approximate value 159 litre is about 0.013% off. In the oil industry, following the definition of the American Petroleum Institute, a standard barrel of oil is often taken to mean the amount of oil that at a standard pressure and temperature would occupy a volume of exactly . This standard barrel of oil will occupy a different volume at different pressures and temperatures. A standard barrel in this context is thus not simply a measure of volume, but of volume under specific conditions. The task of converting this standard barrel of oil to a standard cubic metre of oil is complicated by the fact that the standard cubic metre is defined by the American Petroleum Institute to mean the amount of oil that at 101.325 kPa and occupies 1 cubic metre. The fact that the conditions are not exactly the same means that an exact conversion is impossible unless the exact expansion coefficient of the crude is known, and this will vary from one crude oil to another. For a light oil with density of 850 kilogram per cubic metre (API gravity of 35),API gravity calculated from density_oil as API_g = (141.5 / SG ) ‚àí 131.5, where SG is specific gravity = density_oil / density_water. warming the oil from to might increase its volume by about 0.047%. Conversely, a heavy oil with a density of 934 kg/m3 (API gravity of 20) might only increase in volume by 0.039%. If physically measuring the density at a new temperature is not possible, then tables of empirical data can be used to accurately predict the change in density. In turn, this allows maximum accuracy when converting between standard barrel and standard cubic metre. The logic above also implies the same level of accuracy in measurements for barrels if there is a error in measuring the temperature at time of measuring the volume. For ease of trading, communication and financial accounting, international commodity exchanges often set a conversion factor for benchmark crude oils. For instance the conversion factor set by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil traded at Hardisty, Alberta, Canada is 6.29287 U.S. barrels per cubic metre, despite the uncertainty in converting the volume for crude oil. Regulatory authorities in producing countries set standards for measurement accuracy of produced hydrocarbons, where such measurements affect taxes or royalties to the government. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the measurement accuracy required is ¬±0.25%. =Qualifiers= A barrel can technically be used to specify any volume. Since the actual nature of the fluids being measured varies along the stream, sometimes qualifiers are used to clarify what is being specified. In the oil field, it is often important to differentiate between rates of production of fluids, which may be a mix of oil and water, and rates of production of the oil itself. If a well is producing 10 mbd of fluids with a 20% water cut, then the well would also be said to be producing 8,000 barrels of oil a day (bod). In other circumstances, it can be important to include gas in production and consumption figures. Normally, gas amount is measured in standard cubic feet or cubic metres for volume (as well as in kg or Btu, which don't depend on pressure or temperature). But when necessary, such volume is converted to a volume of oil of equivalent enthalpy of combustion. Production and consumption using this analogue is stated in barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). In the case of water-injection wells, in the United States it is common to refer to the injectivity rate in barrels of water per day (bwd). In Canada, it is measured in cubic metres per day (m3/d). In general, water injection rates will be stated in the same units as oil production rates, since the usual objective is to replace the volume of oil produced with a similar volume of water to maintain reservoir pressure.

Description Well developed crystals of epidote, Ca2Al2(Fe3+;Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system, are of frequent occurrence: they are commonly prismatic in habit, the direction of elongation being perpendicular to the single plane of symmetry. The faces are often deeply striated and crystals are often twinned. Many of the characters of the mineral vary with the amount of iron present for instance, the color, the optical constants, and the specific gravity. The color is green, grey, brown or nearly black, but usually a characteristic shade of yellowish-green or pistachio-green. It displays strong pleochroism, the pleochroic colors being usually green, yellow and brown. Clinozoisite is green, white or pale rose-red group species containing very little iron, thus having the same chemical composition as the orthorhombic mineral zoisite. The name, due to Ha√ºy, is derived from the Greek word \\"epidosis\\" (·ºêœÄŒØŒ¥ŒøœÉŒπœÇ) which means \\"addition\\" in allusion to one side of the ideal prism being longer than the other. Epidote from Alaska Epidote is an abundant rock-forming mineral, but one of secondary origin. It occurs in marble and schistose rocks of metamorphic origin. It is also a product of hydrothermal alteration of various minerals (feldspars, micas, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and others) composing igneous rocks. A rock composed of quartz and epidote is known as epidosite. Well-developed crystals are found at many localities: Knappenwand, near the Gro√üvenediger in the Untersulzbachthal in Salzburg, as magnificent, dark green crystals of long prismatic habit in cavities in epidote schist, with asbestos, adularia, calcite, and apatite; the Ala valley and Traversella in Piedmont; Arendal in Norway; Le Bourg-d'Oisans in Dauphin√©; Haddam in Connecticut; Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, here as large, dark green, tabular crystals with copper ores in metamorphosed limestone. The perfectly transparent, dark green crystals from the Knappenwand and from Brazil have occasionally been cut as gemstones. =Related species= Belonging to the same isomorphous group with epidote are the REE-rich allanite (containing primarily lanthanum, cerium, and yttrium), and the manganese-rich piemontite. Piemontite occurs as small, reddish-black, monoclinic crystals in the manganese mines at San Marcel, near Ivrea in Piedmont, and in crystalline schists at several places in Japan. The purple color of the Egyptian porfido rosso antico is due to the presence of this mineral. Sample of dollaseite (dark brown matrix at arrow points) from Sweden Allanite and dollaseite-(Ce) have the same general epidote formula and contain metals of the cerium group. In external appearance allanite differs widely from epidote, being black or dark brown in color, pitchy in lustre, and opaque in the mass; further, there is little or no cleavage, and well-developed crystals are rare. The crystallographic and optical characters are similar to those of epidote; the pleochroism is strong with reddish-, yellowish-, and greenish-brown colors. Although not a common mineral, allanite is of fairly wide distribution as a primary accessory constituent of many crystalline rocks, gneiss, granite, syenite, rhyolite, andesite, and others. It was first found in the granite of east Greenland and described by Thomas Allan in 1808, after whom the species was named. Allanite is a mineral readily altered by hydration, becoming optically isotropic and amorphous: for this reason several varieties have been distinguished, and many different names applied. Orthite was the name given by J√∂ns Berzelius in 1818 to a hydrated form found as slender prismatic crystals, sometimes a foot in length, at Finbo, near Falun in Sweden. Dollaseite is less common, famous from the Ostanmossa mine in the Norberg district of Sweden.

It was, along with The Apples in Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel, one of the three original projects of The Elephant 6 Recording Company. The band was founded by the remnants of the group Synthetic Flying Machine (Jeff Mangum, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart) in 1994. The band went on hiatus in early 2000, and later reformed in 2009. Bill Doss died on July 31, 2012 (according to some sources, due to an aneurysm, however no official cause of death has been released). Synthetic Flying Machine Synthetic Flying Machine was an early project of Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss, and Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum. The band later went on to become known as the Olivia Tremor Control, with Hart and Doss remaining members while Mangum eventually left to focus on Neutral Milk Hotel. The band had only one official release to their name, Heaven Is for Kids, but there are several other tape cassettes of music distributed among friends and collaborators. Many of the songs performed by Synthetic Flying Machine later became songs by Neutral Milk Hotel (\\"Arms So Real\\") or Olivia Tremor Control (\\"Shaving Spiders\\", \\"Opera House\\"). Jeff Mangum wrote a song about the band of the same name, which became \\"Up and Over\\" and finally \\"The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 3\\" on In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Sound and history The band's distinct sound is a mixture of Doss and Hart's pop and experimental tendencies. Some tracks are 2‚Äì3 minute songs, while others are electro-acoustic collages ranging in length from 2 seconds to 10 minutes, and differing in content from vibrant horns to near silence. Furthermore, the band released a record of experimental electro-acoustic music, The Late Music, Volume One, under the name The Black Swan Network, in 1997. Another Black Swan Network release, a 7\\" EP on the Happy Happy Birthday to Me label, appeared in 2000, though it did not feature Bill Doss. In October 1997, a \\"collaborative\\" LP between the Olivia Tremor Control and The Black Swan Network was released, originally as a tour-only item, and later put out as a CD by Flydaddy, which gave the record the title, The Olivia Tremor Control vs. The Black Swan Network, though the band had never wanted the record to be named as such. Other projects The members of the Olivia Tremor Control embarked on a variety of different projects before and after the band broke up. Eric Harris released a record under the name Frosted Ambassador and later two CD-R releases under his own name on Cloud Recordings, the label founded by Fernandes and Hart in the wake of OTC's demise. Pete Erchick released three records, Individualized Shirts, Special Fanfare For Anything and Lost in the Pancakes, under the name Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't. Bill Doss followed OTC by putting out records as The Sunshine Fix, a name he had used years before. The Sunshine Fix has evolved from a recording project to a formal working band. Hart's post-OTC project, Circulatory System, has taken a similar route. The self-titled 2001 LP continued the melding together of pop and experimental traditions the OTC had worked on and won high accolades from the press. Jeff Mangum followed OTC with Neutral Milk Hotel, releasing On Avery Island and In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, as well as a few \\"underground\\" acoustic demos. Signal Morning, Circulatory System's sophomore LP features the reunion of Will Hart and Bill Doss singing harmonies on its opening track. Signal Morning was released on 8 September 2009 on Cloud Recordings. Will Cullen Hart has collaborated with groups such as Athens Tango Project in which he contributed backup vocals to a cover version of Olivia Tremor Control's song, I Have Been Floated which appeared on the compilation album release, An Enthusiast's Fanfare for Elephant 6 released in 2019. Reunion In 2005, the Olivia Tremor Control temporarily reunited, solely for live shows, at the behest of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival. They appeared at a UK version of the festival, preceded by warm-up shows in Athens, Georgia and London; that summer, they again played Athens, at the Orange Twin Conservation Community, as well as gigs in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and L.A. In the fall of 2008, all members of the Olivia Tremor Control toured with other members of the Elephant 6 collective as part of the Holiday Surprise tour. In May 2009, Will Hart said in an interview that the band had recently re-entered the recording studio: \\"We've got two songs for the next Olivia record, in my opinion. They're on Bill's hard drive.\\" In March 2011, Elf Power drummer Derek Almstead confirmed that he was engineering and playing percussion on the new record and that new material would be debuted at All Tomorrows' Parties later in the year. In addition to this, they have released a song titled North Term Reality under Olivia Tremor Control for AUX Vol. 2. In September 2011, the band released the single The Game You Play Is In Your Head, a 3-song suite. It is unknown whether or not the song is a single from their new album. More live shows were planned including an appearance at the ATP Curated by Jeff Mangum festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England. On January 17, 2012, it was announced that OTC would play the fifth Austin Psych Fest April 27‚Äì29, 2012 at Emo's East in Austin Texas. OTC performed at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago's Union Park on July 13, 2012. On July 31, 2012, the band announced the death of Bill Doss. He died of an aneurysm.

The QR algorithm was developed in the late 1950s by John G. F. Francis and by Vera N. Kublanovskaya, working independently.J.G.F. Francis, \\"The QR Transformation, I\\", The Computer Journal, 4(3), pages 265-271 (1961, received October 1959). doi:10.1093/comjnl/4.3.265 Vera N. Kublanovskaya, \\"On some algorithms for the solution of the complete eigenvalue problem,\\" USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, vol. 1, no. 3, pages 637‚Äì657 (1963, received Feb 1961). Also published in: Zhurnal Vychislitel'noi Matematiki i Matematicheskoi Fiziki, vol.1, no. 4, pages 555‚Äì570 (1961). doi:10.1016/0041-5553(63)90168-X The basic idea is to perform a QR decomposition, writing the matrix as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix, multiply the factors in the reverse order, and iterate. The practical QR algorithm Formally, let A be a real matrix of which we want to compute the eigenvalues, and let A0:=A. At the k-th step (starting with k = 0), we compute the QR decomposition Ak=QkRk where Qk is an orthogonal matrix (i.e., QT = Q‚àí1) and Rk is an upper triangular matrix. We then form Ak+1 = RkQk. Note that : A_{k+1} = R_k Q_k = Q_k^{-1} Q_k R_k Q_k = Q_k^{-1} A_k Q_k = Q_k^{\\\\mathsf{T}} A_k Q_k, so all the Ak are similar and hence they have the same eigenvalues. The algorithm is numerically stable because it proceeds by orthogonal similarity transforms. Under certain conditions, the matrices Ak converge to a triangular matrix, the Schur form of A. The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are listed on the diagonal, and the eigenvalue problem is solved. In testing for convergence it is impractical to require exact zeros, but the Gershgorin circle theorem provides a bound on the error. In this crude form the iterations are relatively expensive. This can be mitigated by first bringing the matrix A to upper Hessenberg form (which costs \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\end{matrix} n^3 + \\\\mathcal{O}(n^2) arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction), with a finite sequence of orthogonal similarity transforms, somewhat like a two-sided QR decomposition. (For QR decomposition, the Householder reflectors are multiplied only on the left, but for the Hessenberg case they are multiplied on both left and right.) Determining the QR decomposition of an upper Hessenberg matrix costs 6 n^2 + \\\\mathcal{O}(n) arithmetic operations. Moreover, because the Hessenberg form is already nearly upper-triangular (it has just one nonzero entry below each diagonal), using it as a starting point reduces the number of steps required for convergence of the QR algorithm. If the original matrix is symmetric, then the upper Hessenberg matrix is also symmetric and thus tridiagonal, and so are all the Ak. This procedure costs \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\end{matrix} n^3 + \\\\mathcal{O}(n^2) arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction. Determining the QR decomposition of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix costs \\\\mathcal{O}(n) operations. The rate of convergence depends on the separation between eigenvalues, so a practical algorithm will use shifts, either explicit or implicit, to increase separation and accelerate convergence. A typical symmetric QR algorithm isolates each eigenvalue (then reduces the size of the matrix) with only one or two iterations, making it efficient as well as robust.  The implicit QR algorithm  In modern computational practice, the QR algorithm is performed in an implicit version which makes the use of multiple shifts easier to introduce. The matrix is first brought to upper Hessenberg form A_0=QAQ^{\\\\mathsf{T}} as in the explicit version; then, at each step, the first column of A_k is transformed via a small-size Householder similarity transformation to the first column of p(A_k) (or p(A_k)e_1), where p(A_k), of degree r, is the polynomial that defines the shifting strategy (often p(x)=(x-\\\\lambda)(x-\\\\bar\\\\lambda), where \\\\lambda and \\\\bar\\\\lambda are the two eigenvalues of the trailing 2 \\\\times 2 principal submatrix of A_k, the so- called implicit double-shift). Then successive Householder transformations of size r+1 are performed in order to return the working matrix A_k to upper Hessenberg form. This operation is known as bulge chasing, due to the peculiar shape of the non-zero entries of the matrix along the steps of the algorithm. As in the first version, deflation is performed as soon as one of the sub- diagonal entries of A_k is sufficiently small. =Renaming proposal= Since in the modern implicit version of the procedure no QR decompositions are explicitly performed, some authors, for instance Watkins, suggested changing its name to Francis algorithm. Golub and Van Loan use the term Francis QR step.  Interpretation and convergence  The QR algorithm can be seen as a more sophisticated variation of the basic \\"power\\" eigenvalue algorithm. Recall that the power algorithm repeatedly multiplies A times a single vector, normalizing after each iteration. The vector converges to an eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. Instead, the QR algorithm works with a complete basis of vectors, using QR decomposition to renormalize (and orthogonalize). For a symmetric matrix A, upon convergence, AQ = QŒõ, where Œõ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues to which A converged, and where Q is a composite of all the orthogonal similarity transforms required to get there. Thus the columns of Q are the eigenvectors.  History  The QR algorithm was preceded by the LR algorithm, which uses the LU decomposition instead of the QR decomposition. The QR algorithm is more stable, so the LR algorithm is rarely used nowadays. However, it represents an important step in the development of the QR algorithm. The LR algorithm was developed in the early 1950s by Heinz Rutishauser, who worked at that time as a research assistant of Eduard Stiefel at ETH Zurich. Stiefel suggested that Rutishauser use the sequence of moments y0T Ak x0, k = 0, 1, ‚Ä¶ (where x0 and y0 are arbitrary vectors) to find the eigenvalues of A. Rutishauser took an algorithm of Alexander Aitken for this task and developed it into the quotient-difference algorithm or qd algorithm. After arranging the computation in a suitable shape, he discovered that the qd algorithm is in fact the iteration Ak = LkUk (LU decomposition), Ak+1 = UkLk, applied on a tridiagonal matrix, from which the LR algorithm follows.  Other variants  One variant of the QR algorithm, the Golub-Kahan-Reinsch algorithm starts with reducing a general matrix into a bidiagonal one.Bochkanov Sergey Anatolyevich.

Lasting from March 9‚Äì29, 1847, it began with the first large-scale amphibious assault conducted by United States military forces, and ended with the surrender and occupation of the city. U.S. forces then marched inland to Mexico City. Background After the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista, much of Zachary Taylor's Army of Occupation was transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott in support of the upcoming campaign. That campaign, determined by Scott and other Washington officials, would be a Veracruz landing and an advance inland.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York: Macmillan, Mexican military intelligence knew in advance of U.S. plans to attack Veracruz, but internal government turmoil left them powerless to send crucial reinforcements before the American assault commenced. Opposing forces Mexican defenses Veracruz was considered to be the strongest fortress in North America at the time. Brigadier General Juan Esteban Morales commanded a garrison of 3,360 men which manned three major forts guarding Veracruz: * Fort Santiago ‚Äì south end of town * Fort Concepci√≥n ‚Äì north top of town ** These two forts included 3,360 men and 89 guns: artillery, 2nd and 8th infantry regiments, 3rd Light Regiment, a picket of 11th Regt., Puebla Libres, Orizaba, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Tehuantepec national guards. Battalions, sappers and enlisted marines. * Fort San Juan de Ul√∫a ‚Äì offshore on the Gallega Reef. Gen. Jose Dur√°n with 1,030 men and 135 guns: artillery, Puebla and Jamiltepec activo battalions, companies of Tuxpan, Tampico and Alvardo activo battalions. * See Orders of Battle Mexican War. Landings The amphibious assault on Veracruz The Americans arrived at Anton Lizardo, Veracruz in early March. Scott agreed with Conner's suggestion for a landing site at Collado Beach, south of Veracruz. The 1st Regular Division under Worth was chosen to make the landing first, followed by Patterson's volunteers and then Twiggs' regular division. Conner's Mosquito Fleet moved to within of the beach to supply covering fire if necessary. By 12:15 pm on 9 March, this force was off Collado Beach, followed by larger vessels over the next three hours and a signal for landing the surfboats at 5:30 pm. Just before the main force touched the beach, a gig dashed ahead, and General Worth with his staff jumped ashore. Worth's whole division landed without firing or receiving a single shot. By 11 pm, Scott's entire army had been brought ashore without a single man lost, and the first large scale amphibious landing conducted by the U.S. military was a success. Siege =Envelopment= Once ashore Patterson's division began marching northward to effect a complete envelopment of the city. One of Patterson's brigades under Gideon Pillow drove off a Mexican cavalry at Malibr√°n, cutting off the Alvarado road and the city's water supply. Quitman and Shields managed to drive off cavalry with one shot attempting to prevent the investment. By 13 March, the U.S. had completed a siege line from Collado in the south to Playa Vergara in the north. On 17 March, siege lines were dug for Scott's siege artillery, sufficient for taking the city but not Ulua. =Investment= The besiegers were plagued by sorties from the city, and Col. Juan Aguayo used the cover of a storm to slip his Alvarado garrison into Veracruz. Commodore Matthew C. Perry, Conner's successor, returned from Norfolk, Virginia after making repairs on the , on 20 March. Perry and Conner met with Scott regarding the Navy's role in the siege, and offered six guns that were to be manned by sailors from the ships. The naval battery was constructed under the direction of Captain Robert E. Lee from the city walls. On March 22, Morales declined a surrender demand from Scott, and the American batteries opened fire at 4:15 pm followed by those of Commander Josiah Tattnall's Mosquito Fleet at 5:45 pm. The Naval battery's heavy cannonballs easily broke the coral walls. Congreve rockets were fired into the defenses and the combined fire forced the abandonment of Fort Santiago and Mexican morale began to drop as civilian deaths reached the hundreds. On March 24, Persifor F. Smith's brigade captured a Mexican soldier with reports that Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna was marching an army from Mexico City to the relief of Veracruz. Scott dispatched Colonel William S. Harney with 100 dragoons to inspect any approaches that Santa Anna might make. Harney reported about 2,000 Mexicans and a battery not far away, and he called for reinforcements. General Patterson led a mixed group of volunteers and dragoons to Harney's aid and cleared the force from their positions, chasing them to Madellin. =Surrender= Attack of the Gun Boats, San Juan de Ulloa, after a sketch by J. M. Ladd, USN Scott made plans for an assault on the city when on 25 March, the Mexicans called for a cease-fire to evacuate women and children which Scott refused. That night, Morales' council of war advised surrender prompting Morales to resign while General Jos√© Juan Landero assumed command. A truce was called at 8 am on 26 March while terms of surrender were negotiated and concluded by 27 March. On 29 March, the Mexicans officially surrendered their garrisons in Veracruz and Fort Ul√∫a and later that day, the U.S. flag flew over San Juan de Ul√∫a. Aftermath The obstacle to an advancement to Mexico City was removed and Scott made immediate plans to leave a small garrison at Veracruz and march inland, his first objective being Jalapa. Along the way, Scott would in fact encounter a sizable Mexican army under Santa Anna at the Battle of Cerro Gordo.

History The professional care of feet was in existence in ancient Egypt as evidenced by bas-relief carvings at the entrance to Ankmahor's tomb dating from about 2400 BC where work on hands and feet is depicted. Corns and calluses were described by Hippocrates who recognized the need to physically reduce hard skin, followed by removal of the cause. He invented skin scrapers for this purpose and these were the original scalpels. Until the turn of the 20th century, chiropodists‚Äînow known as podiatrists‚Äîwere separate from organized medicine. They were independently licensed physicians who treated the feet, ankles and related leg structures. Lewis Durlacher was one of the first people to call for a protected profession. There are records of the King of France employing a personal podiatrist, as did Napoleon. In the United States, President Abraham Lincoln suffered greatly with his feet and chose a chiropodist named Isachar Zacharie, who not only cared for the president‚Äôs feet, but also was sent by President Lincoln on confidential missions to confer with leaders of the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War.http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-5223-4..00113-X&isbn;=978-1-4160-5223-4&sid;=1443544104&uniqId;=411842093-70#4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-5223-4..00113-X --s0010 The first society of chiropodists, now known as podiatrists, was established in New York in 1895‚Äîand still operates there today as NYSPMA. The first school opened in 1911. One year later the British established a society at the London Foot Hospital and a school was added in 1919. In Australia professional associations appeared from 1924 onwards. The first American journal appeared in 1907, followed in 1912 by a UK journal. In 1939, the Australians introduced a training centre as well as a professional journal. Podiatry is a high paying specialty and was listed by Forbes in 2007 as the 15th best paid profession in the United States.

Specific country practices =Australia= In Australia, podiatry is considered as an allied health profession, and is practised by individuals licensed by the Podiatry Board of Australia. There are eight teaching centres (as well as Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand), with two levels of awards‚Äîbachelor's degree (pass and/or honours) such as the Bachelor of Podiatric Medicine offered by Charles Sturt University and University of Western Sydney, and the master-level postgraduate Doctor of Podiatric Medicine offered by the University of Western Australia and the Master of Podiatric Practice by La Trobe University. In Australia there currently exist two levels of professional accreditation and professional privilege: General Podiatrist and the specialist ‚Äì Podiatric Surgeon. There is current lobbying for other specialties to be recognised in Australia such as podopediatrics, diabetes, high risk, musculoskeletal and sports podiatry. Australian podiatrists are able to practise abroad with their qualifications recognised in some Commonwealth countries. Many general podiatrists in Australia do routinely use the title Doctor, Dr. compliant with advertising regulations, and appropriate for the professional standing. Dr is not a protected title and therefore its use is unrestricted in Australia, and may be used by any health professional regulated under AHPRA as per advertising guidelines. There are guidelines advertising for regulated health services were jointly developed by the National Boards under section 39 of the National Law. Section 133 of the National Law regulates advertising of regulated health services. Registration and regulation Australian Podiatrists must register with the Podiatry Board of Australia. The Podiatry Board of Australia is responsible for regulation and recognition of Podiatrists and Podiatric Surgeons, and assessing foreign trained registrants in conjunction with the Australian & New Zealand Podiatry Accreditation Council (ANZPAC).

The cut-off scores from the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) generally range from 70.00 to 95.00 dependent on the popularity and intake of each podiatric medical school. Prospective students can also be of mature age (21 & over) and they apply direct to the university instead of going through UAC. The UWA DPM degree have admission requirements that: completion of a UWA bachelor's degree or equivalent, a minimum GPA of 5.0 from the most recent three years (FTE) of valid study, suitable GAMSAT score, there is no interview for the DPM (Applications are handled via the University), english language competency Australian podiatrists complete an undergraduate degree ranging from 3 to 4 years of education. The first 2 years of this program are generally focused on various biomedical science subjects including functional anatomy, microbiology, biochemistry, physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, evidence-based medicine, sociology and patient psychology, similar to the medical curriculum. The following one years will then be spent focusing on podiatry specific areas such as podiatric anatomy & biomechanics, human gait, podiatric orthopaedics or the non-surgical management of foot abnormalities, podopaediatrics, sports medicine, rheumatology, diabetes, vascular medicine, mental health, wound care, neuroscience & neurology, pharmacology, general medicine, general pathology, local and general anaesthesia, minor & major podiatric surgical procedural techniques such as partial and total nail avulsions, matricectomy, cryotherapy, wound debridement, enucleation, suturing, other cutaneous and electro-surgical procedures and theoretical understanding of procedures performed by orthopaedic and podiatric surgeons. Australian podiatric surgeons are specialist podiatrists with further training in advanced medicine, advanced pharmacology, and training in foot surgery. Podiatrists wishing to pursue specialisation in podiatric surgery must meet the requirements for Fellowship with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. They first complete a degree of 4 years, which includes 2 years of didactic study and 2 years of clinical experience. Following this, a master's degree must be completed with focus on biomechanics, medicine, surgery, general surgery, advanced pharmacology, advanced medical imaging and clinical pathology. They then qualify for the status of Registrar with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. Following surgical training with a podiatric surgeon (3‚Äì5 years), rotations within other medical and surgeons' disciplines, overseas clinical rotations, and passing oral and written exams, Registrars may qualify for Fellowship status.Fellowship Training Program, Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons Fellows are then given Commonwealth accreditation under the Health Insurance Act to be recognised as providers of professional attention, for the purposes of health insurance rebates. Australian podiatric medical schools There are currently nine universities in Australia (plus one in New Zealand) offering varying degrees of podiatric medicine from a Bachelor of Podiatry/Podiatric Medicine (BPod), a Masters of Podiatric Medicine (MPod) and the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) (DPM is a master-level degree). All podiatry schools are accredited by the Australian and New Zealand Podiatry Accreditation Council (ANZPAC). ANZPAC is an independent body comprising members consisting of the Podiatry Registration Boards in Australia and New Zealand. The Board of Management comprises registered podiatrists (nominated by the Registration Boards), nominees from the professional associations (Australasian Podiatry Council and Podiatry New Zealand), nominees from the educational institutions offering podiatry programs and community representation. ANZPAC has been assigned the accreditation functions for the Podiatry Board of Australia under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Health Professions. There are also two more podiatry schools currently being developed at the Australian Catholic University and the University of Ballarat. The following universities offering podiatry areUniversity of Western Australia, Charles Sturt University, La Trobe University, University of Western Sydney, University of South Australia, University of Newcastle (Australia), Queensland University of Technology, Central Queensland University, Southern Cross University, Auckland University of Technology (New Zealand).

All podiatrists may refer patients for Medicare rebatable plain x-rays of the foot, leg, knee and femur, as well as ultrasound examination of soft tissue conditions of the foot. Podiatrists may refer patients for other radiology investigations such as CT, MRI or bone scans, however Medicare rebates do not currently exist for these examinations. Similarly, podiatrists may refer patients when needed to specialist medical practitioners, or for pathology testing, however similar exclusions in the Medicare Benefits Schedule prevent rebates being available to patients for these referrals. =Canada= In Canada, the definition and scope of the practice of podiatry varies provincially. For instance, in some provinces like British Columbia and Alberta, the standards are the same as in the United States where the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) is the accepted qualification. Quebec has also adopted the DPM level of training, although other academic designations may register. Also, in 2004, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res started the first and only program of Podiatric Medicine in Canada based on the American definition of podiatry. This program enlists 25 students yearly across Canada and leads to a DPM upon obtaining 195 credits. In the prairie and Atlantic provinces, the standard was originally based on the British model now called podiatry (chiropody). The province of Ontario has been registering chiropodists since 1944, then introduced new legislation in 1991 (when the Ontario Government imposed a cap on Ontario trained chiropodists becoming podiatrists). If a registered podiatrist from outside of Ontario relocates to Ontario they are required to register with the province and practice as a chiropodist. Podiatrists who were practicing in Ontario previous to the imposed provincial cap were 'grandfathered' and allowed to keep the title of podiatrist as a subclass of chiropody. The scope of these 'grandfathered' (mostly American trained) podiatrists includes boney procedures of the forefoot and the ordering of x-rays in addition to the scope of the chiropodist. In Ontario, podiatrists are required to have a \\"Doctor of Podiatric Medicine/DPM\\" degree (a post-baccalaureate, four-year degree), where the majority of chiropodists currently practicing hold a post-secondary advanced diploma in chiropody, requiring a baccalaureate degree in the sciences or in another field as a prerequisite before entering chiropody. Podiatrists may bill OHIP for their services; chiropodists were restricted in 1991 from billing OHIP. Podiatrists may \\"communicate a diagnosis\\" to their patients (or to their patients' representatives) and perform surgical procedures on the bones of the forefoot; chiropodists may do neither. Chiropodists in Ontario perform soft tissue surgical procedures. Chiropodists and podiatrists are regulated by the College of Chiropodists of Ontario, which had 678 chiropodists and 55 podiatrists registered as of December 31, 2018.http://www.cocoo.on.ca/pdf/annual_report/annual_report_2018.pdf The only English-speaking chiropody program in Canada, in which also has a working chiropody clinic on campus for students to treat patients under the supervision of licensed chiropodists is The Michener Institute ‚Äì affiliated with University Health Network, Toronto. According to The Michener Institute website, chiropody is a branch of medical science that involves the assessment and management of foot and lower limb disorders. This includes the management of a wide variety of disorders, injuries, foot deformities, infections and local manifestations of systemic conditions. A chiropodist is a primary care professional practicing in podiatric medicine in Ontario that specializes in assessment, management and prevention of diseases and disorders of the foot. An essential member of the inter professional healthcare team, the chiropodist is skilled in assessing the needs of their patients and of managing both chronic and acute conditions affecting foot and lower limb function. As a primary care provider capable of independent clinical practice, these skills are often practiced independent of medical referral and medical supervision. =Iran= There are no podiatric medical schools in Iran. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) reviews the dossier of podiatric applicants for medical registration according to the \\"Regulations on the Evaluation of the Educational Credentials of Foreign Graduates\\", updated on 12 Mordad 1388 AHS (3 August 2009 CE).http://edd.behdasht.gov.ir Center for Educational Services, Under-ministry for Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Government of Iran. Retrieved on 2014-04-12 Section 12-5: \\"The specific requirements for evaluation of education degrees in podiatry\\" stipulates that the podiatric degree from the United States will be registered as a professional doctorate in podiatric medicine, provided that the following are met: possession of a bachelor's degree, Successfully passing the MCAT, completion of the podiatric curriculum and obtaining the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) from an accredited school, if required by the home jurisdiction, completion of a one-year postgraduate training, successfully passing of the relevant board examinations, an exception is made for those holding the [3-year undergraduate] Bachelor of Science (Podiatry) degree from accredited schools in the United Kingdom. After successful evaluation by the relevant commission, these degrees will be accepted at the bachelor's level (editorial note: the meaning of this exception is not clearly stated. It appears safe to assume that such bachelor's degrees do not qualify for medical registration and merely allow the holders to enroll in further educational programs). =New Zealand= Chiropody became a registered profession in New Zealand in 1969 with the requirement that all applicants take a recognized three-year course of training. Soon after the professional title was changed from Chiropody to Podiatry and The New Zealand School of Podiatry was established in 1970 at Petone under the direction of John Gallocher. Later the school moved to the Central Institute of Technology, Upper Hutt, Wellington. In 1976 the profession gained the legal right to use a local anaesthetic and began to introduce minor surgical ingrown toenail procedures as part of the scope of practice. New Zealand podiatrists were granted the right of direct referral to radiologists for X-rays in 1984. Acknowledgement of podiatric expertise marked improved services to patients and eventually in 1989 suitably trained podiatrists were able to become licensed to take X-rays within their own practice. Diagnostic radiographic training is incorporated into the degree syllabus and on successful completion of the course, graduates register with the New Zealand National Radiation Laboratory. In 1986, the profession undertook a needs analysis in conjunction with the Central Institute of Technology to identify competencies for podiatry in 2000. A Bachelor of Health Science was introduced in 1993. Auckland University of Technology is now the only provider of podiatry training in New Zealand. =United Kingdom= Mobile chiropodist in Chorley 2011 The scope of practice of UK podiatrists on registration after obtaining a degree in podiatry includes the use and supply of some prescription only medicines, injection therapy and non-invasive surgery e.g. performing partial or total nail resection and removal, with chemical destruction of the tissues. Podiatrists complete about 1,000 supervised clinical hours in the course of training which enables them to recognise systemic disease as it manifests in the foot and will refer on to the appropriate health care professional. Those in the NHS interface between the patients and multidisciplinary teams. The scope of practice of a podiatrist is varied ranging from simple skin care to invasive bone and joint surgery depending on education and training. In order to perform invasive foot surgery a UK podiatrist must undertake extensive postgraduate education and training, usually taking a minimum of 10 years to complete. In a similar way to podiatrists in Australasia, UK podiatrists may continue their studies and qualify as podiatric surgeons. Due to recent changes in legislation, the professional titles ‚Äòchiropodist‚Äô and ‚Äòpodiatrist‚Äô are now protected by law. In the UK there is no difference between the terms chiropodist and podiatrist. Those using protected titles must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). Registration is normally only granted to those holding a bachelor's degree from one of 13 recognized schools of podiatry in the UK. Professional bodies recognised by the Health Professions Council are: The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, The Alliance of Private Sector Practitioners (thealliancepsp.com ), The Institute of Chiropodists and Podiatrists and The British Chiropody and Podiatry Association. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that about six and a half million NHS chiropody treatments were provided to just over one and a half million people in Great Britain in 1977, 19% more than three years earlier. Over 90% of patients receiving these treatments were aged 65 or over. At that time there were about 5,000 state registered chiropodists but only about two-thirds worked for the NHS. The Commission agreed with the suggestion of the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers for the introduction of more foot hygienists to undertake, under the direction of a registered chiropodist, \\"nail cutting and such simple foot-care and hygiene as a fit person should normally carry out for himself.\\" =United States= In the United States, medical and surgical care of the foot and ankle is mainly provided by two groups of physicians: podiatrists (who hold the degree of Doctor of Podiatric Medicine or DPM) and orthopedic surgeons (MD or DO). The first two years of podiatric medical school is similar to training that M.D. and D.O. students receive, but with an emphasized scope on foot, ankle, and lower extremity. Being classified as a second entry degree, in order to be considered for admission an applicant must first complete a minimum of 90 semester hours at the university level or more commonly, complete a bachelor's degree with emphasis on general/organic chemistry, biochemistry, biology, etc. In addition, potential students are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The DPM degree itself takes a minimum of four years to complete. extension angle of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint (MTPJ). The four-year podiatric medical school is followed by a surgical based residency, which is hands-on post-doctoral training. As of July 2013, all residency programs in podiatry were required to transition to a minimum three- years of post-doctoral training. Podiatric residents rotate through core areas of medicine and surgery. They work under MD supervision in such rotations as emergency medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, behavioral medicine, physical medicine & rehabilitation, vascular surgery, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, dermatology and of course podiatric surgery and medicine. Fellowship training is available after residency in such fields such as geriatrics, foot and ankle traumatology, infectious disease etc. In reality though, the residency training of most podiatry residencies today are already highly inclusive of these medical areas. In most states, their scope is limited to areas at or below the ankle joint, however, some states include the leg, as well as the hand as within the scope of podiatry. Podiatric Surgical Training A 40 watt CO2 laser used for podiatry Upon completion of their residency, podiatrists can decide to become board certified by a number of specialty boards including the more common American Board of Podiatric Medicine and/or the American Board of Podiatric Surgery. The American Board of Podiatric Medical Specialties (ABPMS) has been certifying podiatrists since 1998.US Podiatry. K12 Academics Retrieved on 2012-08-24. Within the American Board of Podiatric Surgery, PM&S; 24 graduates can sit for Board Certification in Foot Surgery and those that complete PM&S; 36 can sit for Board Certification in Foot Surgery and Board Certification in Reconstructive Rearfoot & Ankle Surgery. Both boards in ABPS are examined as separate tracks. Though the ABPS and ABPM are more common, other boards are equally challenging and confer board qualified/certified status. Many hospitals and insurance plans do not require board eligibility or certification to participate. Podiatrists certified by the ABPS have successfully completed an intense board certification process comparable to that undertaken by individual MD and DO specialties. There are two surgical certifications under ABPS. They are Foot Surgery and Reconstructive Rearfoot/Ankle (RRA) Surgery. In order to be Board Certified in RRA, the sitting candidate has to have already achieved board certification in Foot Surgery. Certification by ABPS requires initial successful passing of the written examination. Then the candidate is required to submit surgical logs indicating experience and variety. Once accepted, the candidate has to successfully pass oral examination and computer questions of clinical simulation. Practice characteristics While the majority of podiatric physicians are in solo practice, there has been a movement toward larger group practices as well as the use of podiatrists in multi-specialty groups including orthopedic groups, treating diabetes, or in multi-specialty orthopedic surgical groups. Some podiatrists work within clinic practices such as the Indian Health Service (IHS), the Rural Health Centers (RHC) and Community Health Center (FQHC) systems established by the US government to provide services to under-insured and non-insured patients as well as within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs providing care to veterans of military service. Some podiatrists have primarily surgical practices. Some specialists complete additional fellowship training in reconstruction of the foot and ankle from the effect of diabetes or physical trauma. Other surgeons practice minimally invasive percutaneous surgery for cosmetic correction of hammer toes and bunions. Podiatrists use medical, orthopedic, biomechanical and surgical principles to maintain and correct foot deformities. Podiatrists may also be able to be a Chief of Surgery in a public or private hospital. Colleges and education There are nine colleges of podiatric medicine in the United States. These are governed by the American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine (AACPM). The AACPM describes its mission as to enhance academic podiatric medicine.

It is connected with the Tasman Sea through a tidal channel at its southern end known as The Entrance. It is also connected with two smaller lakes, Budgewoi Lake and through that to Lake Munmorah. Tuggerah Lake has a catchment area of and a surface area of . When full, Tuggerah Lake covers an area of around . Heavy rains in June 2007 caused Tuggerah Lake to flood, affecting areas of Long Jetty, Killarney Vale and Chittaway Point. On the sea side of the peninsula is Norah Head and its historic lighthouse. =Urban areas= The lake adjoins extensive areas of suburban development. Much of the original settlement bordering the lake was oriented towards domestic tourism; with Sydney residents drawn to the area and staying in camp and early cabin-style accommodation clustered around towns of The Entrance and Long Jetty, from there spreading to Toukley on the northern lakeshore. Many towns surround the lake including Lake Munmorah, The Entrance, Killarney Vale, Berkeley Vale, Tumbi Umbi, Wyong, Kanwal, Gorokan and Toukley. Long Jetty South of The Entrance is Long Jetty, so named for the jetty built to service the first sub-division of land at The Entrance. The original jetty was washed away in a flood at Easter 1927; the present structure replaced it, built in 1927‚Äì28 to a length of . Parts of the jetty have fallen into disrepair and it requires frequent periodic repairs and replacement of its structure and decking. =Fishing and boating= Tuggerah Lake is well known for its recreational fishing with species such as luderick, bream, flathead and whiting caught from the shoreline and boats. Prawns can be plentiful over the summer months during the dark of the new moon. Fishing in Tuggerah Lake is generally poor during late winter and early spring, particularly when westerly winds are prevalent. Special purpose markers (coloured yellow) around Terilbah Island and Pelican Island denote areas where net and trap fishing are restricted. Other parts of the lake may have permanent or temporary fishing restrictions in force. Due to its large size and shallow depth strong winds can whip up a steep choppy surface that can be hazardous to small boats, however Tuggerah Lake is considered quite safe for most forms of small recreational watercraft if common sense and general safe boating practices are followed. Many parts of Tuggerah Lake are quite shallow with sand or weed flats exposed at low water. Marked channels should be navigated with care and at reduced speed. Mobile phone coverage is available across the entire lake. Environment Substantial residential and commercial development, involving excavation and alteration of native vegetation and natural watercourses in the lake catchment and hinterland, has given rise to siltation and changes in the make up of the lakebed and foreshore. During 2004 and 2005 the Tuggerah Lakes Restoration project has been attempting to restore and revive the lake system. Urbanisation and development have caused increased nutrients to build up in the lake stimulating weed growth. Restoration work has focussed on inshore removal of weed and ooze; foreshore reclamation and reinstatement; pollutant traps; and channel dredging to increase the tidal exchange of water with the sea. Wyrrabalong National Park borders the lake and the sea separating the residential areas of Toukley and The Entrance, and preserves the last significant littoral rainforest on the Central Coast. The lake is part of the Tuggerah Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for a variety of water and woodland birds.BirdLife International. (2011).

It is a remake of the 1936 Frank Capra film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, which in turn is based on the 1935 short story Opera Hat by Clarence Budington Kelland. Plot Multi-billionaire Preston Blake (Harve Presnell) dies while climbing Mount Everest. With no immediate heir, it is unclear who will inherit Blake's massive fortune. It is found that Blake has a living grandnephew named Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), who runs a pizzeria in Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire and also writes greeting cards hoping to sell them to Hallmark. Deeds is flown to New York City by businessman Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher), who temporarily controls Blake Media. Once Deeds arrives, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer. He remains in New York while the legal details are worked out. The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), who works for a tabloid TV show called Inside Access, has a co-worker pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds. Research indicates that Deeds wants to meet a girl by \\"rescuing\\" her, the same way his father had met his mother. Deeds \\"rescues\\" Babe and she goes out with him pretending to be \\"Pam Dawson\\", a school nurse from a fictional town called Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa (which later turns out to be a real place, surprising Babe). Though Babe initially wanted a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the unfailingly hard-hearted Deeds. She decides to tell him who she really is, but Inside Access, in concert with Cedar (who learned the truth from the fake purse snatcher who is smitten with Babe) reveals the truth to Deeds first. Heartbroken, Deeds decides to return home to Mandrake Falls and decides to donate his $40 billion inheritance to the United Negro College Fund. After returning to Mandrake Falls, Deeds learns from his friend, Crazy Eyes, (Steve Buscemi) that Cedar intends to sell the company, causing employees to lose their jobs. Cedar had convinced Longfellow to sell his shares by lying that he would command the company in honor of Preston's lifetime of work. Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back, but after saving her life when she falls through the ice over a lake, he rejects her, saying he does not really know who she is. At a shareholders meeting, Cedar has persuaded everyone to sell the company, until Deeds (who has bought a single share) arrives and convinces everyone not to sell. But Cedar controls a majority of the shares and the sale is approved. Babe arrives and reveals that, having studied Blake's personal journal after she stole it from Deeds earlier, she has determined that Emilio Lopez (John Turturro), Preston Blake's longtime butler, is Blake's illegitimate son and the true heir as a result of Preston's affair with his maid. Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media, starting by firing Cedar. Babe reconciles with Deeds after professing she loves him. Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and offers him a billion dollars, some of which Deeds spends on red Corvettes for everyone in Mandrake Falls. When he returns to the pizzeria with Babe, he learns that Hallmark is interested in buying one of his greeting cards: the one he wrote for Babe when he professed his love for her. They share a kiss as the movie ends with Crazy Eyes crashing his Corvette into a tree, but is unharmed.

Production The producers were looking for a small, \\"old-fashioned, New England-type\\" town close to New York, when they serendipitously discovered New Milford, Connecticut, and, upon having lunch there at \\"The Bistro Cafe\\", decided the town would be the perfect choice to portray the fictional home-town of Deeds, Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, and the cafe was a great location to use as \\"'Deeds' Pizza\\" restaurant.per DVD 'extras' featurette Some scenes were also shot in Carmel, New York. Several sequences were filmed in New York City around Spring 2001. Following the September 11th, 2001 attacks, images of the World Trade Center towers were digitally removed from several shots of New York City. The Blake Media Hotel scenes were shot in Beverly Hills, California. In the scene where Longfellow Deeds and Chuck Cedar playing tennis at the tennis court was filmed at Roosevelt Island, New York. Reception = Critical response = The film received mainly negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 22% based on reviews from 156 critics, with an average rating score of 4.05/10. Its consensus states: \\"This update of Capra doesn't hold a candle to the original, and even on its own merits, Mr. Deeds is still indifferently acted and stale\\". Mr. Deeds received three Razzie Award nominations including Worst Actor (Adam Sandler), Worst Actress (Winona Ryder) and Worst Remake or Sequel. However, the film also won a Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actor (Sandler).

He wrote more than 50 books, mostly in the fields of African-American history and general U.S. history, most notably, American Negro Slave Revolts (1943), a classic in the field. He also compiled the 7-volume Documentary History of the Negro People (1951‚Äì1994). In addition, he compiled a wide variety of primary documents supporting study of African- American history. He was the literary executor for W. E. B. Du Bois. From the 1940s, Aptheker was a prominent figure in U.S. scholarly discourse. Aptheker was blacklisted in academia during the 1950s because of his Communist Party membership. He succeeded V. J. Jerome in 1955 as editor of Political Affairs, a communist theory magazine. Biography =Early life and education= Herbert Aptheker was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest child of a wealthy Jewish family. In 1931, when he was 16, he accompanied his father on a business trip to Alabama.Gary Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the United States\\": A Biography of Herbert Aptheker. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2015; pg. 4. There he learned first-hand about the oppression of African Americans under Jim Crow Laws in the South.Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the World,\\" pp. 4-5. The trip proved shocking and life-altering for Aptheker, who upon his return to Brooklyn began writing a column called \\"The Dark Side of The South\\" for his Erasmus Hall High School newspaper Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the World,\\" pg. 5. Aptheker graduated from high school in the spring of 1933, during the Great Depression. Although admitted to Columbia University, he was unable to gain admission to the main campus of Columbia College, which had already filled a quota set for Jews by college president Nicholas Murray Butler. Instead, Aptheker was relegated to enrolling at Seth Low Junior College in Brooklyn Heights, a satellite school established by Butler as a de facto dumping ground for JewsLeeza Hirt, \\"Columbia for Jews? The Untold Story of Seth Low Junior College,\\" The Current, Fall 2016. and ethnic Italians admitted in excess of Butler's quotas. During his time at Seth Low, Aptheker was first drawn into political activity, helping to organize anti-war rallies and speaking on behalf of the communist-backed National Student League (NSL) and the socialist-backed Student League for Industrial Democracy.Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the World,\\" pg. 6. He began reading the Communist Party's daily newspaper, The Daily Worker, at this time as well as the party's literary-artistic monthly, The New Masses, although he did not yet become a member of the party. After two years at Seth Low, Aptheker was allowed to enroll at Columbia's main campus in Morningside Heights in Manhattan, but not with full status as a member of Columbia College. Instead, he was classified as a \\"university undergraduate\\", which placed him on track for a lesser Bachelor of Science degree rather than the higher-status Bachelor of Arts, which he received in 1936. At Columbia, Aptheker continued to engage in the anti-war movement, both through the NSL and the American League Against War and Fascism, a broader mass organization of the Communist Party during its Popular Front period. Aptheker earned his Master's degree from Columbia in 1937 and a Ph.D. in 1943 from the same institution.Francis X. Gannon, Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume 3. Boston: Western Islands, 1972; pp. 215-218. In September 1939, he joined the Communist Party USA. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in sociology in 1945. =Marriage and World War II= In 1942 Aptheker married Fay Philippa Aptheker (1905‚Äì1999), a first cousin who was also a native of Brooklyn. She was a union organizer and political activist. They were married for 62 years, until her death. Their daughter, Bettina, was born in 1944 at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Bragg, North Carolina during Aptheker's service in World War II. Aptheker participated in Operation Overlord, the invasion of northern France; by 1945 he had been promoted to the rank of Major in the artillery. He commanded the all-black 350th artillery unit.Robin D.G. Kelley, \\"Interview of Herbert Aptheker,\\" The Journal of American History, vol. 87, no. 1 (June 2000), pp. 151‚Äì167 In December 1950, after failing to respond to the U.S. Army's letter of inquiry about his Communist political activity, he lost his commission after an honorable discharge. =Work in the South= Returning with his family to the South after the war, Aptheker became an educational worker for the Food and Tobacco Workers Union. Shortly afterward, he served as secretary of the \\"Abolish Peonage Committee,\\" which had been established in 1940 by activists in New York and Chicago, with the support of the International Labor Defense (IDL), an arm of the Communist Party. \\"Peons\\" in the South, the vast majority of whom were African American, were typically rural sharecroppers who became tied to plantations by the debt they owed to the plantation owners, or to local merchants. This practice had effectively maintained African-American slavery after the Civil War in all but name.Douglas A. Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II, 2009 Given repeated publicity about peonage abuses, in 1941 Attorney General Francis Biddle had directed all federal prosecutors to \\"actively investigate and try more peonage cases.\\" On the verge of entering World War II, the US would make more effort to reduce rural peonage. Similarly, southern states had run convict leasing programs, hiring out convicts to industries and taking the fees as revenue. Several southern states had banned convict leasing to industries in the early 20th century: Tennessee, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Florida by 1923.[https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento- prod/filer_public/SBAN/Images/Classrooms/Slavery%20by%20Another%20Name%20History%20Background_Final.pdf Nancy O‚ÄôBrien Wagner, \\"Slavery by Another Name: History Background\\", Twin Cities Public Television, 2012 Research in African-American history Aptheker's master's thesis, a study of Nat Turner's slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831, laid the groundwork for his future work on the history of American slave revolts. Aptheker revealed Turner's heroism, demonstrating how his rebellion was rooted in resistance to the exploitative conditions of the Southern slave system. His Negro Slave Revolts in the United States 1526‚Äì1860 (1939), includes a table of documented slave revolts by year and state. His doctoral dissertation, American Negro Slave Revolts, was published in 1943. Doing research in Southern libraries and archives, he uncovered 250 similar episodes. Aptheker set forth historiographical arguments, challenging some conservative histories, most notably the perspective in the writings of Georgia-born historian Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, who was considered part of the Dunning School at Columbia University. Historians of this group had been critical of Reconstruction and argued that slavery was no worse than urban labor conditions. Phillips had characterized enslaved African Americans as childlike, inferior, and uncivilized; he argued that slavery was a benign institution; and defended the preservation of the Southern plantation system. Such works had been common in the field before Aptheker's scholarship. Aptheker long emphasized W. E. B. Du Bois' social science scholarship and lifelong struggle for African Americans to achieve equality. In his work as a historian, he compiled a documentary history of African Americans in the United States, a monumental collection which he started publishing in 1951. It eventually resulted in seven volumes of primary documents, a tremendous resource for African-American studies. Post-war activism During the 1950s and the period of McCarthyism, Aptheker was blacklisted in academia because of his membership in the Communist Party. He was unable to obtain an appointment as a university lecturer for a decade. Aptheker served on the National Committee of the CPUSA from 1957 to 1991. For several years in the 1960s and 1970s, he was executive director of the American Institute For Marxist Studies. In 1966, he ran in the U.S. House of Representatives election in New York's 12th Congressional District for the Peace and Freedom Party; he received 3,562 votes. Given his work on African-American documents and history, Aptheker was chosen by W. E. B. Du Bois to be his literary executor. A strong opponent of the Vietnam War, Aptheker lectured on the subject on college campuses nationwide. From 1969 to 1973, Aptheker taught a full-year course annually in Afro-American History at Bryn Mawr College. Aptheker died at age 87 on March 17, 2003, in Mountain View, California. His wife had died in 1999. Allegation of child abuse Bettina Aptheker is a professor of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In her 2006 memoir, Intimate Politics, she claimed that she was sexually abused by her father from the age of 3 to 13. Her memories of the events began to arise in 1999, after her mother's death and when she was working on a memoir. She sought counseling for her dissociation and recovered memory. Alt URL She also wrote that she and her father reconciled before his death in 2003. Her assertion caused great controversy among historians and activists. Some raised questions about her credibility; others questioned the Old Left's desire to bury the news, and still others wondered at how to look at Aptheker's work in view of this information. In her memoir, Bettina Aptheker wrote more at length about her father's work on African-American history. She thought that he celebrated black resistance in part \\"to compensate for his deep shame about the way, he believed, the Jews had acted during the Holocaust.\\" The controversy about her claims about her father continued for months, with many essays and letters published on the History News Network hosted by George Mason University. In November 2007, the historian Christopher Phelps published an overview of the issues. He also wrote that he had interviewed Kate Miller, who had been present during Bettina Aptheker's 1999 conversation with her father about the abuse, and confirmed her account.Christopher Phelps, \\"Herbert Aptheker: His daughter's partner confirms molestation charge\\", The Nation, 5 November 2007, reprinted at History News Network, accessed 18 January 2012 Works *\\"Mississippi Reconstruction and the Negro Leader Charles Caldwell\\", Science & Society (Fall 1947) *Afro American History: 1910-1932, (Citadel Press: New York, 1951) *History and Reality, *The American Revolution 1763-1783,(International Publishers: New York, 1960) * American Negro Slave Revolts (1943), (Cameron Associates: NY, 1955) * Documentary History of the Negro People, 7-volumes, (Carol Publishing Group: NJ, 1951‚Äì1994) *The Truth about Hungary, (Kraus Reprint: NY, 1957) *And Why Not Every Man?, (Seven Seas Books: CA, 1961) *Dare We Be Free?, (New Century Publishers: Dublin, 1961) *Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion: Including the 1831 \\"Confessions\\", (Dover: NY, 1966) * \\"Imperialism and Irrationalism\\", TELOS 04 (Fall 1969) *The Urgency of Marxist-Christian Dialogue, (Kraus Reprint: NY, 1970) *American Negro Slave Revolts, (International Publishers: New York, 1974) *Early Years of the Republic: From the End of the Revolution to the First Administration of Washington, (International Publishers: New York, 1976) *Negro People in America, (Kraus Reprint: NY, 1977) *The World of C.

Course and features Reflections of the forest on the Gordon River.The \\"weak tea\\" coloured water of the Gordon River. The Gordon River rises below Mount Hobhouse in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park draining the eastern slopes of the King William Range. The river flows generally south and to the west of the Gordon Range before flowing west through the Gordon Gap and spilling into Lake Gordon, an impounded reservoir created by damming the Gordon at the Gordon Dam. Together with water fed from Lake Pedder, the principal purpose of the reservoir is for generation of hydro-electricity at the Gordon Power Station. Flowing from east to west through Lake Gordon, the river continues west, passing through the Gordon Splits, a series of gorges once considered impassable until 1958 when Olegas Truchanas, a conservationist and nature photographer, was the first person to navigate the Gordon River in a kayak. The river flows north by west and then due north and finally due west as it reaches its mouth and empties into Macquarie Harbour at Wrights Bay. From source to mouth, the river is joined by 25 tributaries including the Gell, Boyes, Pokana, Holley, Adams, Serpentine, Albert, Orange, Smith, Denison, Olga, Sprent, Franklin, and the Spence rivers. The river descends over its course; much of which is located in an uninhabited wilderness area, contained with the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park and Southwest National Park. The lower part of the Gordon River is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and contains a cold-climate rainforest and rare trees. As with many rivers in western Tasmania, the water is fresh and drinkable, yet has the colour of weak tea due to the absorption of tannin from button grass growing in the catchment area. Additional dams were proposed for the lower part of the river. However, these plans were changed as a result of significant opposition and public opinion. In particular, the Franklin Dam was proposed just downstream of the junction with the Franklin River, and would have flooded much of both rivers. It was a major political and environmental issue in the 1980s. Boat excursions to the lower Gordon River from Macquarie Harbour are popular with tourists in Strahan. Seaplane flights depart Strahan during the warmer months and include an out landing on the Gordon River (usually a duration of one hour).

He is well known for his distinct guitar work and drumming in the band Emperor, as well as his formation of the death metal band Zyklon. In very early Emperor releases, he was called Samot (his name \\"Tomas\\" backward), and with the formation of Zyklon he became known as Zamoth. Samoth was the owner of the record label Nocturnal Art Productions and had a close relationship with Candlelight Records. Biography Samoth was born on 9 June 1974 in Hammerfest, Norway. He is the son of Spoonful of Blues bass player Jens Haugen, who encouraged his son to play bass guitar. He grew up in Akkerhaugen, Norway. When Samoth was a young man, he met a fellow musician, who would later become known as Ihsahn, at a rock clinic in Bergen. The two soon became friends and started playing music together. They formed a band and moved through various names ‚Äì they were called Dark Device, Xerasia, and finally Embryonic. The group eventually settled on the name Thou Shalt Suffer in 1991. They were playing an early form of black metal with keyboards strongly influenced by death metal, particularly vocally. Samoth and Ihsahn's friendship proved to be strong, and the two eventually took their musicianship to a new level. Partially due to the influence of Euronymous of the band Mayhem, Samoth left Thou Shalt Suffer and with Ihsahn, began writing music for a new band called Emperor (in which he played drums). Ihsahn was the only member of Thou Shalt Suffer to remain, and soon bass player Mortiis and drummer Faust were recruited for Emperor; Samoth moved back to his more familiar position of guitar. At this point, the group was playing fully developed black metal. Emperor was quick to release several demos in 1992 and 1993, which gained them recognition and popularity in the underground. Mortiis did not stay in the band, and decided to form his own, more electronic-based solo band. He was succeeded by Tchort. In 1994 Samoth was sentenced to 16 months in prison for burning Skjold Church in Vindafjord, together with Varg Vikernes.NTB. (1994, June 29th). Ubetinget fengsel for kirkebrann.

(Norwegian) VG, p. 11. where Samoth performed as a session bass player. As Tchort and Faust were also imprisoned at this time, Ihsahn was the only remaining band member outside prison, and Emperor did not release another album for three years. Tchort and Faust did not return to the band. After years of playing in Emperor and being featured on various black metal side projects, Samoth, in conjunction with Ihsahn, decided to dissolve Emperor in 2001 due to their differing musical tastes. Although black metal was both Samoth and Ihsahn's biggest influence and favorite genre of music, Samoth was leaning toward a futuristic death metal sound, while Ihsahn was more influenced by progressive metal and symphonic metal. After Emperor's final release, Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire & Demise, composed entirely by Ihsahn, Emperor was no more. Samoth went on to play guitar with fellow drummer Trym in the death metal band Zyklon. Emperor regrouped in 2006 with the core trio of Ihsahn, Samoth and Trym augmented by a bassist and a keyboardist, and played a few one-night-off gigs in Europe and USA in 2006 and 2007. Recently Samoth was involved in Norwegian- American supergroup Scum, which also featured B√•rd Faust, Cosmocrator of Mindgrinder, Chasey Chaos of Amen and Happy Tom from Turbonegro. He has one daughter with ex-wife Andrea Haugen. He remarried since his divorce and he also has a daughter with his wife Erin.

At the , Strahan had a population of 658. Port Originally developed as a port of access for the mining settlements in the area, the town was known as Long Bay or Regatta Point until 1877, when it was formally named after the colony‚Äôs Governor, Sir George Cumine Strahan.

The Strahan Marine Board was an important authority dealing with the issues of the port and Macquarie Harbour up until the end of the twentieth century when it was absorbed into the Hobart Marine Board. Post offices Macquarie Harbour Post Office opened on 16 May 1878, was renamed Strahan in 1881 and closed in 1891. East Strahan Post Office opened in 1891 and was renamed Strahan in 1893. Fishing and tourism Strahan port and fishing vessels Historically Strahan has been a port to a small fishing fleet that braves the west coast conditions and Hell's Gates. It is the nearest inhabited locality to Cape Sorell and is literally the 'gateway' to the south- west wilderness - as boats, planes and helicopters utilise Strahan as their base when travelling into the region. The Huon Pine industry utilised stands around the harbour and up the tributary rivers - including King River, the Franklin River and the Gordon River. Strahan is the location of the only all weather commercial airport in Western Tasmania, Strahan Airport. Also located at the airport is the Automatic Weather Station, an important western Tasmania weather observation point. Strahan is the base for boat trips to Sarah Island, the notorious penal settlement that garnered the reputation as the harshest penal settlement in the Australian colonies, and the lower Gordon River. Strahan is an access point to the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, which was declared part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area in 1982. For several years Strahan became the focus of a conservation campaign opposed to the proposed Franklin-below-Gordon Dam. It is the home of the Round Earth Theatre Company, which conducts explanatory tours of Sarah Island and also has produced a daily enactment/play about Sarah Island, The Ship That Never Was, which has exceeded 5000 performances and is Australia's longest running play. Railway stopping place Strahan was a stopping place on the former Strahan to Zeehan railway. It was also known as Strahan Wharf. page 105 tickets were issues between 1892 and 1953, and 4th June 1960 was the closure date of the Strahan - Zeehand line Strahan was connected with the former Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company railway line that had a terminus at Regatta Point. The railway was government owned, and ran past the wharf at Strahan, and continued around the harbour before running north on its way to Zeehan. The formation of the railway line can be seen around the edge of the harbour. The northern shore of Macquarie Harbour is across the bay from Regatta Point, the terminus of the recently reconstructed, West Coast Wilderness Railway. Cultural references An extinct species of Banksia, fossils of which were found in sediment at nearby Regatta Point, was named Banksia strahanensis after the town. Climate Strahan has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild damp summers and cool, very rainy winters. Lying on Tasmania's West Coast, Strahan is frequently buffeted by low pressure systems from the Southern Ocean, causing heavy rain and gusty winds. Strahan receives 15.7 days, on average, of clear weather annually. Temperatures vary little between summer and winter, with minimums below having been recorded in every month. Hot weather is rare, with an average of only one day reaching or above every three years. The highest recorded temperature is on 14 February 1982, with the lowest recorded being on 30 June 1983. Snow down to sea level is rare but falls frequently in the mountains just a few kilometers inland of Strahan.

It is approximately 315 sq.km, and has an average depth of 15m, with deeper places up to 50m. The inlet is navigable by shallow- draft vessels. The main channel is kept clear by the presence of a rock wall on the outside of the channel's curve. This man-made wall prevents erosion and keeps the channel deep and narrow, rather than allowing the channel to become wide and shallow. A reported Aboriginal name for the harbour is Parralaongatek. The harbour was named in honour of Scottish Major General Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth Colonial Governor of New South Wales. History James Kelly wrote in his narrative First Discovery of Port Davey and Macquarie Harbour how he sailed from Hobart in a small open five-oared whaleboat to discover Macquarie Harbour on 28 December 1815. However, different accounts of the journey have indicated different methods and dates of the discovery. In the commentary to the Historical Records of Australia, the editor notes that T.W. Birch stated before the commission of inquiry into the state of the colony in 1820 that Kelly had discovered Macquarie Harbour after proceeding along in a boat from Port Davey where they had travelled in the schooner Henrietta Packet. Kelly gave evidence before the commission, and did not mention any discoveries. In a letter dated 11 April 1816, preserved in the record office, London, T.W. Birch transmitted an account of this voyage, which records the discovery of Macquarie Harbour on 26 December 1815. Charles Whitham notes variations on the date. Surveyor-General Oxley of New South Wales in March 1820 battled with the seas around the heads and Hells Gates. Surveyor-General Evans travelled in the area in 1821-22. In September 2020, almost 100 Pilot whales were rescued from the harbour after becoming stranded. An estimated 350 whales which were unable to be rescued died. Convict era The harbour was established as a prison which was a place of \\"extreme physical and mental torture\\" .Flannery, T.F. (1994) The Future Eaters: An ecological history of the Australasian lands and people Chatswood: New South Wales It was built for British convicts but many Irish patriots and Tasmanian Aborigines were also detained there.  Rivers  The King River which cuts through the West Coast Range and the Gordon River empty into Macquarie Harbour. The narrow entrance to Macquarie Harbour has hazardous tidal currents and is called Hell's Gates. Outside of the Harbour the entrance area is known as Macquarie Heads, and the most western point is Cape Sorell. The sheer volume of fresh water that pours into the Harbour through the rivers, combined with the narrow exit result in barometric tides. When there is rain in the mountains surrounding the Harbour, the tide rises, and it falls when the atmospheric pressure reverses and results in less rain. The Queen River, King River and Macquarie Harbour were all polluted by mine waste from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company until its closing in 1994. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River. The Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program was carried out by the office of Supervising Scientist and the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Land Management over the following two years. The result of the program a marked reduction in the waste material entering the rivers and harbour. * Bird River - mouth of river in Kelly Basin * Braddon River - mouth on mid-eastern shore * Clark River - mouth at Pillinger, Kelly Basin. * Gordon River - mouth on south eastern end of harbour * King River - mouth at north east of harbour Islands Photo of the lighthouse on Bonnet Island, Hells gate, Tasmania (looking out from Harbour) Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour.

Later the small port of Strahan was developed on the shores of Macquarie Harbour to support the nearby mining settlements, mainly Queenstown. Another port was developed on the south east section of the harbour in Kelly Basin along with townsite of Pillinger.

Location and features King river at entrance to Macquarie Harbour - the West Coast Wilderness Railway line passes from the right of this picture to enter the King River Valley at the left of photo. Delta of eroded material is typical at this location. Hell's Gates is at top of picture (out of view) and Strahan is to the right off photo. Photo hazy due to bushfires of January 2003. Formed by the confluence of the Eldon and South Eldon rivers, the King River rises near Eldon Range on the slopes of the West Coast Range between Mount Huxley and Mount Jukes. The river flows generally south and then west, joined by nine tributaries including the Tofft, Governor, Nelson, Princess, and Queen rivers before emptying into Macquarie Harbour near , and merging with the Southern Ocean. The river descends over its course. The upper section of the river lies in a glaciated valley, with glacier scouring scars high up on the upper parts of the mountains of the West Coast Range. Also small glacial lakes occur on and north of Mount Sedgwick. Lake Beatrice for instance lies on the eastern slope of Mount Sedgwick. The upper portion of the King River valley was first surveyed for damming in 1917 by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company.  King River Power Development Scheme  The river is impounded by the Crotty Dam to form Lake Burbury, covering over the former valley and named after the first Australian born Governor of Tasmania, Stanley Burbury. Water drawn from the lake is used to supply the conventional hydroelectric John Butters Power Station, operated by Hydro Tasmania. Below the dam wall, the river flows through a narrow channel as it flows west towards , in the last of the river, where extensive silting from the mine tailings that have been carried down from Queenstown, has created such a resource that at least one mining company has in the past proposed the mining of the deposits at the edge of the river, as well as the delta formed out into Macquarie Harbour due to the amount of economically viable materials in the silt. The small timber mill community adjacent to the old alignment of the Lyell Highway was submerged, as was a significant portion of the old railway alignment of the North Mount Lyell Railway between Linda and Pillinger. The site of the townsite of Crotty, and the smelters of Crotty were also submerged. =Queen River= King River gorge lower west end, from Abt Railway looking east The King River was considered to be Australia's most polluted river.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-24/fix-the-rivers-challenge- for-tas-phd-students/7874112 Mining started in the 1880s, with the Queen River, a major tributary of the King River, being used for waste water disposal from the Mt Lyell copper mine. Between 1922 and 1995 low grade ore was concentrated on site and the tailings (ore-washing residue) dumped in the river also. About 1.5 million tonnes of sulfidic tailings entered the river system each year up to 1995, along with huge volumes of acidic, metal-rich water flowing from the workings. This 'acid mine drainage' is derived from water leaching through the exposed and oxidised sulfide rocks. When it was in operation, the fumes from the ore smelter produced acid rain which also leached minerals from the bare Queenstown hills. In 1992 the King River was dammed above the confluence with the Queen River to generate hydroelectric power at the Crotty Dam. This changed the flow regime in the King River, and affected the way tailings were transported through the river system. The tailings in the river greatly affect the water quality. About 100 million tonnes of tailings have been deposited on the banks and bed of the King River and in a delta at the mouth of the river where it enters Macquarie Harbour. Since the closure of the mine in late 1995, and the construction of a tailings dam by the new operators, tailings no longer enter the river system. However, acid water continues to enter the river due to mine dewatering and run-off from the waste rock dumps. Without the buffering previously provided by the alkaline tailings, the acidity in the Queen and King rivers has increased, and dissolved metal concentrations have greatly increased-to levels highly toxic to aquatic life. =Abt Railway route= The north bank (except for the Teepookana to Quarter Mile Bridge section which was on the south bank) of the lower portion of the King River valley was the route for the old \\"Abt\\" rack railway to Queenstown. In 1962 the original builder and owner, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company closed and removed the line. This has been since restored in early 2002 for tourism purposes. The new line follows exactly the same route and is known as the West Coast Wilderness Railway.

Mafia-like groups offer a solution of sorts to the trust problem by playing the role of a government for the underworld and supplying protection to people involved in illegal markets ordeals. They may play that role poorly, sometimes veering toward extortion rather than genuine protection, but they do play it.\\" The term \\"mafia\\" derives from the Sicilian Mafia. Mafias often engage in secondary activities such as gambling, loan sharking, drug-trafficking, prostitution, and fraud. The term \\"mafia\\" was originally applied only to the Sicilian Mafia and originates in Sicily, but it has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, e.g., \\"the Russian Mafia\\" or \\"the Japanese Mafia\\". The term is applied informally by the press and public; the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms (e.g. the Sicilian Mafia and the related Italian-American Mafia refer to their organizations as \\"Cosa Nostra\\"; the \\"Japanese Mafia\\" calls itself \\"Yakuza\\"; and \\"Russian Mafia\\" groups often call themselves \\"Bratva\\"). When used alone and without any qualifier, \\"Mafia\\" or \\"the Mafia\\" typically refers to either the Sicilian Mafia or the American Mafia and sometimes Italian organized crime in general (e.g., Camorra, 'Ndrangheta, Sacra Corona Unita, Stidda, etc.). Etymology The word mafia () derives from the Sicilian adjective mafiusu, which, roughly translated, means \\"swagger\\", but can also be translated as \\"boldness\\" or \\"bravado\\". In reference to a man, mafiusu (mafioso in Italian) in 19th century Sicily signified \\"fearless\\", \\"enterprising\\", and \\"proud\\", according to scholar Diego Gambetta.This etymology is based on the books Che cosa √® la mafia? by Gaetano Mosca, Mafioso by Gaia Servadio, The Sicilian Mafia by Diego Gambetta, Mafia & Mafiosi by Henner Hess, and Cosa Nostra by John Dickie (see Books below). In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective mafiusa means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'. Because Sicily was once an Islamic emirate from 831 to 1072, mafia may have come to Sicilian through Arabic, though the word's origins are uncertain. Possible Arabic roots of the word include: *ma'afi (ŸÖÿπŸÅŸä) = exempted. In Islamic law, Jizya, is the yearly tax imposed on non- Muslims residing in Muslim lands. And people who pay it are \\"exempted\\" from prosecution. *m√†ha = quarry, cave; especially the mafie, the caves in the region of Marsala, which acted as hiding places for persecuted Muslims and later served other types of refugees, in particular Giuseppe Garibaldi's \\"Redshirts\\" after their embarkment on Sicily in 1860 in the struggle for Italian unification.According to , \\"cave\\" in Arabic literary writing is Maqtaa hagiar, while in popular Arabic it is pronounced as Mahias hagiar and then \\"from Maqtaa (Mahias) = mafia, that is cave, hence the name (ma)qotai, quarrymen, stone-cutters, that is, mafia.\\" (Loschiavo 1962: 27-30). See: Fabrizio Fioretti (2011), Il termine \\"mafia\\", Sveuƒçili≈°te Jurja Dobrile u Puli.Mosca, Che cosa √® la mafia?, p. 51Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, pp. 1-3Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, pp. 259-261.Coluccello, Challenging the Mafia Mystique, p.3 *mahyas (ŸÖŸáŸäÿßÿµ) = aggressive boasting, bragging *marfud (ŸÖÿ±ŸÅŸàÿ∂) = rejected, considered to be the most plausible derivation; marfud developed into marpiuni (swindler) to marpiusu and finally mafiusu.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 282 quoting Lo Monaco (1990), Lingua nostra. *mu'afa (ŸÖÿπÿßŸÅŸâ) = safety, protection *Ma √†fir = the name of an Arab tribe that ruled Palermo. The local peasants imitated these Arabs and as a result the tribe's name entered the popular lexicon. The word mafia was then used to refer to the defenders of Palermo during the Sicilian Vespers against rule of the Capetian House of Anjou on 30 March 1282. *mafy√°, meaning \\"place of shade\\". The word \\"shade\\" meaning refuge or derived from refuge. After the Normans destroyed the Saracen rule in Sicily in the eleventh century, Sicily became feudalistic. Most Arab smallholders became serfs on new estates, with some escaping to \\"the Mafia.\\" It became a secret refuge. The public's association of the word with the criminal secret society was perhaps inspired by the 1863 play ' (\\"The Mafiosi of the Vicaria\\") by Giuseppe Rizzotto and Gaspare Mosca. The words mafia and mafiusi are never mentioned in the play. The play is about a Palermo prison gang with traits similar to the Mafia: a boss, an initiation ritual, and talk of \\"umirt√†\\" (omert√† or code of silence) and \\"pizzu\\" (a codeword for extortion money).Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, p. 136. The play had great success throughout Italy. Soon after, the use of the term \\"mafia\\" began appearing in the Italian state's early reports on the phenomenon. The word made its first official appearance in 1865 in a report by the prefect of Palermo .Lupo, The History of the Mafia , p. 3. Definitions The term \\"mafia\\" was never officially used by Sicilian mafiosi, who prefer to refer to their organization as \\"Cosa Nostra\\". Nevertheless, it is typically by comparison to the groups and families that comprise the Sicilian Mafia that other criminal groups are given the label. Giovanni Falcone, an anti-Mafia judge murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992, objected to the conflation of the term \\"Mafia\\" with organized crime in general: =Mafias as private protection firms= Scholars such as Diego GambettaDiego Gambetta (1993). The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection and Leopoldo Franchetti have characterized the Sicilian Mafia as a \\"cartel of private protection firms\\", whose primary business is protection racketeering: they use their fearsome reputation for violence to deter people from swindling, robbing, or competing with those who pay them for protection. For many businessmen in Sicily, they provide an essential service when they cannot rely on the police and judiciary to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves (this is often because they are engaged in black market deals). Scholars have observed that many other societies around the world have criminal organizations of their own that provide essentially the same protection service through similar methods. For instance, in Russia after the collapse of Communism, the state security system had all but collapsed, forcing businessmen to hire criminal gangs to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves. These gangs are popularly called \\"the Russian Mafia\\" by foreigners, but they prefer to go by the term krysha. In his analysis of the Sicilian Mafia, Gambetta provided the following hypothetical scenario to illustrate the Mafia's function in the Sicilian economy. Suppose a grocer wants to buy meat from a butcher without paying sales tax to the government. Because this is a black market deal, neither party can take the other to court if the other cheats. The grocer is afraid that the butcher will sell him rotten meat. The butcher is afraid that the grocer will not pay him. If the butcher and the grocer can't get over their mistrust and refuse to trade, they would both miss out on an opportunity for profit. Their solution is to ask the local mafioso to oversee the transaction, in exchange for a fee proportional to the value of the transaction but below the legal tax. If the butcher cheats the grocer by selling rotten meat, the mafioso will punish the butcher. If the grocer cheats the butcher by not paying on time and in full, the mafioso will punish the grocer. Punishment might take the form of a violent assault or vandalism against property. The grocer and the butcher both fear the mafioso, so each honors their side of the bargain. All three parties profit. =Mafia-type organizations under Italian law= Introduced by Pio La Torre, article 416-bis of the Italian Penal Code defines a Mafia-type association (Associazione di Tipo Mafioso) as one where \\"those belonging to the association exploit the potential for intimidation which their membership gives them, and the compliance and omert√† which membership entails and which lead to the committing of crimes, the direct or indirect assumption of management or control of financial activities, concessions, permissions, enterprises and public services for the purpose of deriving profit or wrongful advantages for themselves or others.\\"Seindal, Mafia: money and politics in Sicily, p. 20Art. 416-bis, Codice Penale - Associazione di Tipo mafioso International Mafia-proper can refer to either: *American Mafia *Sicilian Mafia (aka \\"Cosa Nostra\\") =Italy= Map of Italy's main criminal syndicates.

Historically part of Staffordshire, Sedgley is on the A459 road between Wolverhampton and Dudley, and was formerly the seat of an ancient manor comprising several smaller villages, including Gornal, Gospel End, Woodsetton, Ettingshall, Coseley, and Brierley (now Bradley). In 1894, the manor was split to create the Sedgley and Coseley urban districts, the bulk of which were later merged into the Dudley County Borough in 1966. Most of Sedgley was absorbed into an expanded County Borough of Dudley in 1966, with some parts being incorporated into Seisdon and Wolverhampton. Since 1974 it has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. History Steam tram at Bull Ring, Sedgley, in the early 20th century The place name Sedgley was first mentioned in a 985 charter from King √Üthelred to Lady Wulfr≈´n, when describing the Wolverhampton border. The original Old English place name was 'Secg's lƒìah' ‚Äì Secg being a personal name (meaning sword-bearing man or warrior) and lƒìah meaning wood, glade or woodland clearing.David Horovitz ‚Äì The Place-Names of Staffordshire (2006) Sedgley was also mentioned in the Domesday Book, as an estate held by William Fitz-Ansculf, Lord of Dudley. Stephen Cox & Son Ltd, Iron & Steel & Safe Engineers of Sedgley; makers' plate on a safe displayed at the Black Country Living Museum Originally dotted with farming communities in the middle-ages, the village became industrialized as natural resources such as coal and limestone were exploited, and by the 18th century it was producing goods such as iron and brick. Sedgley expanded rapidly during the early part of the 20th century, partly in response to the development of the nearby Baggeridge Colliery, despite a depletion in raw materials and a general decline in industry. As industry continued to decline, much of the area became redeveloped, with residential suburbs now dominating the landscape. Many pre-1900 buildings in Sedgley survive to this day. They include Queen Victoria Primary School (1897), All Saints' Church (1805) and the early 19th century courthouse, now used as a public house. =Civic History= The ancient Manor of Sedgley consisted of nine villages; Sedgley, Gospel End, Cotwall End, Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, Woodsetton, Coseley, Ettingshall and Brierley. In 1897, the villages of Coseley, Ettingshall and Brierley broke away from the Manor of Sedgley to form the Coseley Urban District, while Sedgley itself, Gospel End, Cotwall End, Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, and Woodsetton were formed into the Sedgley Urban District. The entire area was part of the Wolverhampton Parliamentary Borough, created in 1832. The east of the Sedgley district was transferred into Dudley as long ago as 1926, to allow for the development of the Priory and Wrens Nest Estates, where new council housing was built to rehouse families from the slum clearances in central Dudley in the 10 years leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The Old Park Farm Estate was added in the early 1950s.Dudley Sedgley Urban District Council survived until 1966, when the majority of the area was merged into the Dudley County Borough, along with the Coseley and Brierley Hill districts. The Gospel End area, however, was merged into the Seisdon Rural District (later South Staffordshire), and the Goldthorn Park estate in the extreme north of the area was transferred into Wolverhampton. The Gornal villages are generally not considered part of modern-day Sedgley, nor is the bulk of Woodsetton. Gospel End is no longer even in the same county as Sedgley, having remained in Staffordshire. Neighbourhoods =Bull Ring= The central area of Sedgley, so named because it was originally the site of bull baiting before the sport was declared illegal in 1835. All signs of the actual ring were destroyed in about 1930 on the construction of a traffic island, but the traffic island is still known as the Bull Ring. The current Bull Ring is surrounded by a number of notable buildings. The Court House, built in the early 19th century, was originally the law court for Sedgley but is now empty despite their attempts of a succession of owners to keep in competitive with other local pubs. These law courts were relocated to a building at the nearby police station until the town's courts were declared redundant in 1988. The Red Lion is approximately the same age as the Court House, and was once the village prison. It is still connected to the Court House by a passageway, though this has long fallen into disuse. The Clifton was opened in 1937 as Sedgley's first cinema, and remained open until 1978, when it closed and was converted into a bingo hall before being taken over by JD Wetherspoon and converted into a public house in 1998. The White Horse was built in the 19th century and was refurbished in 2014. Since then it has been the liveliest pub in Sedgley. Monty's wine bar also opened in 1998 in what was once a food store. Presto opened a large supermarket on High Holborn in the town centre in 1987, on the site of a former filling station ‚Äì with a former public car park being incorporated into the supermarket. A year later it was re-branded Safeway, and in 2004 it was taken over by the Midcounties Co- Operative. This in turn closed in the April 2017 and was re-opened in August 2017 as an Asda following a major refurbishment. =High Arcal Estate= Situated to the south of the town centre. It was developed in phases on part of a large field between 1992 and 1996; part of the field has been retained as a public open space and play area. The estate consists of around 300 Housing Association houses, flats and bungalows. Three-bedroom houses are the most frequent type of property in the area. Most residents on the estate are tenants of their homes, while some have shared ownership or full ownership. High Arcal is the largest post-1970s housing development in Sedgley. =Cotwall End= Cotwall End is situated around the rural Cotwall End Valley, and is one of the nine historic villages of the Sedgley manor. A few pre-1900 buildings still exist, but the face of the area has changed dramatically since the Second World War by the construction of mostly upmarket detached houses in Cotwall End Road and Catholic Lane. Cotwall End Primary School has served the area since 1962, by which time most of the current surrounding houses had been built. The Sandyfields Estate between Cotwall End Road and Sandyfields Road was built in the late 1950s, and is similar in style and layout to the nearby Brownswall and Straits Estates. One of the few surviving buildings from the historic village of Cotwall End is Spout House Farm, which was built in the 18th century and remained in use for some 200 years, finally being abandoned during the 1970s. The farm house and buildings fell into disrepair over the next two decades but were restored in 2001 and converted into apartments. A nature reserve, Cotwall End Valley, was opened in the area by Dudley council in 1969. Since 2005 the Brockswood Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit making company caring for rescued animals, has operated from the nature reserve.Cotwall End Local Nature ReserveBrockswood at Cotwall End \\"Cotwall End LNR\\" Natural England. Retrieved 27 July 2020. =Brownswall Estate= Situated to the north of Cotwall End Valley, this private housing estate was developed by Coseley-based builders Joseph Webb between 1956 and 1959, consisting of semi-detached and detached houses and bungalows with either two or three bedrooms. Most of the homes on the estate are three-bedroomed semi detached houses. It is also served by a recreation ground which includes a large football pitch and at one stage also a playground. However, the playground was dismantled in 2000 after more than 10 years of continued vandalism and gradual loss of playing equipment, which had reduced its popularity with local children. =Northway= Situated north of Cotwall End towards the border with Wolverhampton. The development began in the mid 1950s on land to the north of Gospel End Road, gathered pace in the 1960s and was mostly completed in the 1970s (by which time some 1,000 houses had been built) to join up with Wolverhampton Road. Alder Coppice Primary School was opened on the Northway estate in 1967. Alder Coppice, designated a local nature reserve in November 2019, is next to the estate.\\"Sedgley residents welcome new nature reserve\\" Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, 25 November 2019. Retrieved 21 August 2020. Also adjoining the estate is Sedgley Hall Park, built in the grounds of Sedgley Hall, a 15th-century house which was demolished in 1966. The park includes playing facilities for children, although some of the playing equipment was dismantled in the 1990s and 2000s due to vandalism. The centre of the Northway Estate features shops, a medical centre and public house called \\"The Cabin\\", which was part of the late 1960s phase of the estate. =Beacon Estate= The Beacon Estate was built by Sedgley UDC in the shadow of Beacon Hill during the 1920s and 1930s, with two small sections being added in the 1940s and 1950s. Some of the first houses built by Sedgley UDC were on the estate. During the early hours of July 28, 2012, Shane Watson, a 23-year- old man who lived on the estate, was found murdered in an alleyway on the estate. Two local men, Shylon Wishart and James Cartwright, were later convicted of Mr Watson's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.Shane Watson murder: Two teenagers guilty Places of interest =All Saints' Church= All Saints' Church, Sedgley All Saints' Church is a parish church situated in the centre of Sedgley. The first records of the church date back to the Domesday Survey of 1086, but the current structure dates to the early 19th century. Paid for by the Earl of Dudley, the Neo-Gothic building originally had a seating capacity of over 1,000, but was later re-seated to hold 850. The organ which was fitted in the church on its completion had originally been in Westminster Abbey. The current church was built in 1805 and is located on the corner of Vicar Street and Dean Street, with the modern vicarage and church hall on the opposite side of Vicar Street. At the time, it was the only parish church in the large but relatively lightly populated parish of Sedgley, but the parish was later divided into five ecclesiastical districts, to cover the nine villages of the Manor. =Baggeridge Park= Sedgley Beacon Baggeridge Park is a country park located 1.5 miles south- west of Sedgley in Gospel End. Originally part of the Earl of Dudley's Himley estate, coal mining operations began on the site in 1902, with the opening of the Baggeridge Colliery. After its closure in 1968 the colliery was bought by Seisdon Rural District Council, and later granted country park status in 1970. Full reclamation of the land commenced in January 1981, with the park officially opened by Princess Anne in June 1983. It has so far been largely free of many of the problems which have become increasingly common across the rest of Sedgley since then. =Sedgley Beacon= Beacon Hill, one of several Beacon hills in England, is above sea level, one of the highest points in the West Midlands. It is well known for fossils. The hill was once the site where beacons were lit to warn local people of invaders. Sedgley Beacon Hill provides views across the Black Country, Cannock Chase and Birmingham to the east, and to the Wrekin, Clee Hills and Malvern Hills to the west; on very clear days it is possible to see the hills of North Staffordshire and Derbyshire, as well as the mountains of both North and South Wales. It is also possible to see another Beacon hill ‚Äì Barr Beacon, some 15 miles away. =Sarah Hughes Brewery= The Sarah Hughes Brewery founded in 1921 in a Victorian brew house and pub is situated in Bilston Street, Sedgley, attached to the Beacon Hotel. Education =Primary schools= * Queen Victoria Primary School ‚Äì built in 1897, situated in the town centre. The school was one of the first to take part in a government-sponsored initiative to extend school hours with additional programs beyond the traditional school day, aimed at making better use of public resources for community benefit. New classrooms were built in 2006 to replace mobile classrooms that had been at the school since the 1970s. The original 1897 building is still in existence, and an extension dating from 1931 is also still standing. Students from Queen Victoria mostly transfer to The Dormston School; situated adjacent to the Queen Victoria school site. The two schools often collaborate in enrichment programs for younger students such as the JSLA (Junior Sports Leaders Award) students attending the primary school to teach younger students. Queen Victoria students often use the Mill Theatre for school productions, notably the first production to take place under such circumstance was \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" for the Millennium production. The school is a 3‚Äì11 school which includes a nursery unit which opened in the 1970s, when the school also opened to 12 year olds as part of a local education reorganisation. However, the school lost a significant number of its pupils to the new Alder Coppice and Cotwall End schools during the 1960s, which were built to accommodate Sedgley's rapidly growing population in the postwar years. There was also a senior school at Queen Victoria for pupils aged over 11 years until 1937, by which time Dormston School had opened nearby. The first and middle school buildings were connected in the early 1980s with the construction of a new administration area. The age range was altered to 3‚Äì11 from September 1990. * Cotwall End Primary School ‚Äì built in 1962, situated about half a mile west of the town centre. It provides a two-form entry for pupils aged 3‚Äì11 years. Originally a one-form entry school, it became a two-form entry school in 1971 following the completion of a new infant school building. Cotwall End originally had separate infant and junior schools (becoming a first and middle school in 1972), but merged in 1981 to form a single primary school, with the first and middle school departments reverting to infant and junior school when the leaving age was reduced from 12 to 11 after July 1990. * Alder Coppice Primary School was opened in 1967 and situated about a mile north-west of the town centre on the Northway Estate. The current headteacher is Dr Duncan Jones, who arrived in January 2006 to replace the retiring Mr David Cox, who had been at the school since April 1999. His predecessor was Mrs Barbara Carter. The school's previous headteacher, Mr Colin Gould, left in October 1995 for disciplinary reasons. Alder Coppice was put into special measures in December 1999 after OFSTED inspectors criticised the school's weak management of resources and lack of direction, but it came out of special measures 18 months later and is successful again. Doctor Duncan Jones took over from David Cox in January 2006. It was originally two separate infant and junior schools (5‚Äì7 and 7‚Äì11 respectively), with a nursery unit being added in the 1970s around the same time that the infant and junior schools became first and middle schools in September 1972. However, the first and middle schools merged to form a primary school in September 1988, and the two departments reverted to infant and junior in September 1990 when the age of secondary transfer was reduced from 12 to 11. * St Chad's Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary school, although non-Catholic children are permitted to attend. The school opened in 1870 in a building attached to the church. Two teachers taught approximately 70 children. In 1876, the Victorian School was completed, but eventually became overcrowded. In 1954, work started on the New School. The first three classrooms opened in 1956. Later in 1962 the hall was added. After 1969, the old school became the Dining Room. Further classrooms were added in 1969 and 1973. All three school buildings remain on site, as does the church. It is situated about a quarter of a mile south of the town centre. * Straits Primary School ‚Äì built in 1968 to serve the (then) new Straits housing estate. It is situated about two miles south-west of the town centre. The current headmaster is Mr Len Haslehurst, who has there since April 2012. His predecessor was Mr Adrian Slack, who was at the school for 15 years. On Adrian Slack's arrival, the school had been placed into special measures by OFSTED inspectors who had criticised the school heavily under its previous management. It came out of special measures in 1999 and is now one of the strongest performing primary schools in the whole Dudley Borough. In September 1989, mobile buildings in the school grounds were used as accommodation for pupils who were starting the new Milking Bank Primary School just over the border in Dudley, as the new school building was not ready in time for the 1989/90 academic year. However, the Milking Bank pupils left the Straits site on 27 November 1989 when their new school buildings was opened. =Secondary schools= * Dormston School ‚Äì built in 1935, situated in the centre of Sedgley. Has expanded greatly since the late 1960s, and since 1996 has included a sixth form centre in partnership with Dudley College. Its status changed from secondary modern to comprehensive in 1975. The age range on its opening was 11+, before changing to 12‚Äì16 in 1972 and 11‚Äì16 in 1990. * High Arcal School ‚Äì built in 1961, situated about half a mile east of Sedgley in Woodsetton, and was a grammar school until becoming comprehensive in 1975. It had a sixth form until 1990. Sixth form facilities returned to the school in 2002, when the sixth form being run in partnership with Dormston School and Dudley College was extended to High Arcal. =Former schools= * Flax Hall Primary School ‚Äì opened in the 1950s but closed in 1989 due to falling pupil numbers. The school buildings survive and are now used as a community centre. * Tudor County Primary School ‚Äì opened in the late 19th century, served the community of Upper Gornal until its closure in July 1986. The school buildings were used as an adult education centre until their demolition in 1996, when the site was redeveloped for housing. Transport Due to its hilly geography Sedgley has never had a rail or canal link, although near its historic border with Kingswinford there was a halt on the railway between Stourbridge and Wolverhampton known as Gornal Halt which opened in 1925 and closed in 1932 after just seven years in use, although the line on which it was situated survived into the 1960s. However, it is served by bus routes to neighbouring areas such as Wolverhampton, Dudley, Bilston and Tipton. Crime Crime in Sedgley increased significantly during the 1990s and early 2000s, but has fallen in more recent years. In the ward of Sedgley (which includes the town centre, Brownswall, Northway and Beacon estates as well as some of the High Arcal Estate) it was not uncommon for more than 100 crimes to be reported in a single month ‚Äì with anti-social behaviour by teenagers being particularly rife, more often than not fuelled by alcohol or drugs. The police regularly had to deal with incidents at Dormston School involving pupils. However, by 2014 the number of reported crimes in the Sedgley ward has regularly fallen to less than 50 crimes in a month, with the final two months of 2013 seeing less than 40 crimes reported each month.

The lake environment is administered by the Lake Illawarra Authority, a New South Wales statutory authority established pursuant to the with the aim of transforming the degraded waters and foreshores of Lake Illawarra into an attractive recreational and tourist resource. Location and features Sunset over Lake Illawarra, 2008 Windang, 2008 Albion Park and Albion Park Rail Located south of the city of Wollongong, north of the city of Shellharbour, and northeast of Dapto, Lake Illawarra receives runoff from the Illawarra escarpment through Macquarie Rivulet and Mullet Creek, drawing from a catchment area of . With an average depth of , the relatively shallow lake, brought about because of infilling by sand which has been eroded from the surrounding catchments, covers a surface area of . At an elevation of , the maximum volume of water held in the lake is . The narrow tidal entrance to the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean is located at Windang. Before 2007 Lake Illawarra was frequently closed to the sea. The lake system received large amounts of nutrient and sediment from the catchment which tended to remain within the lake. Water levels within the lake also fluctuated greatly, affecting the local flora species. In July 2007 the Lake Illawarra Authority completed works on training the entrance of the lake to create a permanent opening to the sea. Located on the western shore of Lake Illawarra at Yallah is the natural gas-powered Tallawarra Power Station. The power station draws water from the lake for cooling purposes, and returns water to the lake via an onsite water management system that ensures water quality is maintained at levels above the catchment average. The lake's location within the sprawling Wollongong urban area means that Lake Illawarra is vulnerable to pollution and urban run-off. =Recreation= Lake Illawarra is popular for recreational fishing, prawning and sailing. On 12 January 2009, it is suspected a man was bitten by a bull shark whilst snorkelling at Windang, near the mouth of Lake Illawarra. Birds found at the lake include pelicans, cormorants, musk ducks, hoary-headed grebes, black swans, black ducks, grey teal ducks, herons, ibises and spoonbills. History The traditional custodians of the land surrounding what is now known as Lake Illawarra are the Aboriginal Tharawal and Wadi Wadi peoples. Lake Illawarra was a valuable source of food and spirituality. Burial sites and middens (shell and camp rubbish heaps) discovered at Windang and surrounding areas indicate that the Wadi Wadi used the area extensively and performed various corroborees and ceremonies in the area. The name Illawarra is derived from various adaptions of the Aboriginal Tharawal language words of elouera, eloura, or allowrie; illa, wurra, or warra mean generally a pleasant place near the sea, or high place near the sea, or white clay mountain. Matthew Flinders and George Bass called the lake Tom Thumb's Lagoon on Flinders' chart, named after their little boat the Tom Thumb, when they were there in March 1796. In Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history, Joseph Davis provides a wide-ranging environmental and historical biography of the lake and its foreshores. The book also contains many images and photographs depicting the lake. Davis edited John Brown of Brownsville: his manuscripts, letterbook and the records of Dapto Show Society 1857-1904 that deals with the man who did most to protect the vegetation of the lake islands, and he authored Gooseberry & Hooka: the island reserves of Lake Illawarra 1829-1947, the latter examining the records of John Brown and others and deals with the history of these two islands and how they survived to become nature refuges rather than recreation reserves.

It is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, and was founded in 1839. With the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, it forms part of the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics. HCO houses a collection of approximately 500,000 astronomical plates taken between the mid-1880s and 1989 (with a gap from 1953‚Äì1968). This 100-year coverage is a unique resource for studying temporal variations in the universe. The Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard project is digitally scanning and archiving these photographic plates. History Sketch of Harvard's Great Refractor telescope In 1839, the Harvard Corporation voted to appoint William Cranch Bond, a prominent Boston clockmaker, as \\"Astronomical Observer to the University\\" (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO's first telescope, the 15-inch Great Refractor, was installed in 1847. That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867. Between 1847 and 1852 Bond and pioneer photographer John Adams Whipple used the Great Refractor telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power. This was the largest telescope in North America at that time, and their images of the moon took the prize for technical excellence in photography at the 1851 Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace in London. On the night of July 16‚Äì17, 1850, Whipple and Bond made the first daguerreotype of a star (Vega). Harvard College Observatory is historically important to astronomy, as many women including Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, Williamina Fleming, and Florence Cushman performed pivotal stellar classification research. Cannon, Leavitt and Cushman were hired initially as \\"computers\\" to perform calculations and examine stellar photographs, but later made insightful connections in their research. Publications From 1898 to 1926, a series of Bulletins were issued containing many of the major discoveries of the period. These were then replaced by Announcement Cards which continued to be issued until 1952. In 1908, the observatory published the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue, which gave rise to the HR star catalogue, now maintained by the Yale University Observatory as the Bright Star Catalogue.

As at the , the suburb had a population of 10,730. History The name Dapto is said to be an Aboriginal word either from Dabpeto meaning \\"water plenty\\", or from tap-toe which described the way a lame Aboriginal elder walked. The suburb was officially founded in 1834, when George Brown transferred the Ship Inn from Wollongong to Mullet Creek Farm, in an area now named in his honour as Brownsville. After an unsuccessful attempt at wheat growing in the 1850s, Dapto embraced the dairy industry. In 1887 the railway opened and a butter factory was established. This began a transformation of Dapto and the town centre shifted south to where the new station was located. The Australian Smelting Company's works were established on Kanahooka Road and employed over 500 men. A railway, operated by the Illawarra Harbour and Land Corporation Limited, connected the smelter with the Government railway at Dapto. By 1903 the Commissioner for Railways declared that Dapto was the most valuable station on the Illawarra line, its traffic being double that of Wollongong. The books John Brown of Brownsville (2012), Gooseberry and Hooka (2012) and Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history (2005) ‚Äì all written by Joseph Davis and published by the Lake Illawarra Authority ‚Äì contain much detail about Dapto's history. Dapto has a number of heritage- listed sites, including Horsley Homestead on Bong Bong Road. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 10,730 people in Dapto. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.7% of the population. * 79.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 6.1% and Scotland 1.0%. * 89.2% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 26.1%, No Religion 26.0% and Anglican 23.9%. Further information On Koonawarra Point is Mount Brown Reserve, a hill protected by a nature reserve for its important habitat. The eastern side and summit is owned by Tallawarra Power Station. Dapto used to be home to a smelting industry but this has now closed. Most of the town is residential with several commercial areas. The main one includes Dapto Mall, which is on the Princes Highway. A small area of the escarpment west of Dapto is protected as part of the Illawarra Escapment State Recreation Area, though not accessible to the public. The escarpment west of Dapto includes Mount Bong Bong, the site of an aeroplane crash when the controllers mistook Lake Illawarra for Botany Bay. A plaque commemorates this event in Dapto. Much of the land to the west is still used as farmland, though other ventures such as the shooting grounds exist. The land to the west is noticeably more hilly than the plain to the north of Wollongong. The South Coast line electric rail service terminated in Dapto prior to electrification being extended to Kiama in 2001. The area of Dapto west of this rail line, formerly pastoral land, has undergone significant expansion over the past 20 years. This area has become the fastest growing part of the greater Wollongong region and consists of a sprawling, medium-density suburbia known as Horsley, now officially a suburb in its own right. The Dapto Greyhound Racing Club, locally known as the 'Dapto Dogs', runs races every Thursday evening. The Dapto Canaries compete in the local Illawarra Rugby League. Dapto was once, during an episode of the ABC TV show The Aunty Jack Show, part of a parody of the nearby city of Wollongong. The lyrics of the Lucky Starr song \\"I've Been Everywhere\\" were changed so that, instead of listing a wide range of Australian towns, the song said \\"I've been to Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong,... Wollongong, Wollongong, Dapto, Wollongong\\". =Dapto Mall= Entrance to Dapto Mall Dapto Mall is fourth-largest shopping centre in the Illawarra region, after competitors Wollongong Central, Stockland Shellharbour and Warrawong Plaza. Dapto Mall features Big W, Woolworths and Coles and around 66 stores. =Dapto Ribbonwood Centre= The centre was Dapto's new community centre after relocating in 2001, it is named so after the species of tree that is planted in front. The local library is located on topmost floor of Level 1. It also hosts several conference rooms that can be hired out for a variety of events, ranging from private, small gatherings, to large social events, such as entertainment. The Ribbonwood Centre is also the home of CPSA Dapto Seniors a 'not for profit' community organisation and the largest senior citizen group in the Illawarra, its fortnightly meetings and many weekly activities take place in Heininger House. Heininger House was incorporated in the Ribbonwood Centre when the community centre was constructed in 2001. File:Dapto Ribbonwood centre north facade.jpgThe northern facade File:Dapto ribbonwood centre interior.jpgThe view from the interior of the library on Level 1 =Dapto Anglican Church= The Dapto Anglican Church centre is adjacent to the Dapto Mall and the Dapto Grayhound Racing Club; it has services running from three other sites including the St Aidens building, the hall of Dapto Primary School on a Sunday morning, and the St Lukes Brownsville building (which is historically listed and over 100 years old). There are six services held weekly, as well as children and youth activities on Friday nights, children's programs on a Sunday morning and during the weeks of the school holidays, 'Cafe Church' during the week, and many one-off activities. =Dapto Uniting Church= Dapto Uniting Church. Dapto Uniting Church is located in the heart of Dapto, next to the Dapto Medical Centre on the Princes Highway. Services are held at 9:30am every Sunday morning and incorporate both contemporary and tradition styles of worship. Children's programs are held during the Sunday service, Sunday's Cool, and mid-week on Wednesdays, Tiddlywinks playgroup. The Dapto Uniting congregation is a healthy community composed of people of all generations, cultures and backgrounds. The Dapto Uniting Church traces its roots right back to 1841 when Sunday services were first held in a Dapto schoolroom under the leadership of Presbyterian minister Rev. John Tait. With the establishment of the railway network in 1887, the Dapto area experienced a period of continued urban expansion over the ensuing decades. The current red brick building, St Andrews, was officially opened and dedicated on 7 February 1959. Construction work commenced in 1981 to attach new hall facilities to the existing church building. For many years, the Dapto Uniting family has sought to serve the local community, through ministries such as the Op Shop, regular Market Days, Family Fun Days and group Heart & Soul Exercise sessions. =St. John's Catholic Church= St. John's Church is the public worship centre of Dapto's Catholic population, and can be found in Jeramatta Street. Mass times are: Saturday Vigil Mass ‚Äì 5:00pm, and Sundays at 7:30, 9:30 and 6:00pm. Cups of tea may be had after every mass. It also has a new Youth Group. =Dapto Public School= The original Dapto Public School opened in August 1875, and was operated out of a local church hall. A permanent and more central location was opened on the corner of Byamee and Moombara Streets in 1928, which remained the schools' location until 2004. Due to large expansion of the Horsley area, the school relocated to Sierra Drive, Horsley, opening in 2004.

He is best known for his collaborations with writer Alan Moore, which include the miniseries Watchmen and the Superman story \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\". He was an artist for 2000 AD, for which he contributed a large body of work from its first issue in 1977. Early life Gibbons was born on 14 April 1949, at Forest Gate Hospital in London, to Chester, a town planner, and Gladys, a secretary. He began reading comic books at the age of seven. A self-taught artist, he illustrated his own comic strips. Gibbons became a building surveyor but eventually entered the UK comics industry as a letterer for IPC Media. He left his surveyor job to focus on his comics career. British comics work Gibbons earliest published work was in British underground comics, starting with The Trials of Nasty Tales, including the main cover illustration, and continuing in cOZmic Comics produced by Felix Dennis. =IPC Comics= Gibbons entered the British comics industry by working on horror and action titles for both DC Thomson and IPC. One of his earlier works was a 12-part comic-series titled Year of the Shark Men for D.C. Thomson's The Wizard magazine, in April 1976 ‚Äì July 1976\\"Year of the Shark Men\\" Retrieved on 22 May 2019 When the science-fiction title 2000 AD was set up in the mid-1970s, Gibbons contributed artwork to the first issue, Prog 01 (February 1977), and went on to draw the first 24 instalments of Harlem Heroes, one of the founding (and pre-Judge Dredd) strips. Midway through the comic's first year he began illustrating Dan Dare, a cherished project for Gibbons who had been a fan of the original series and artist Frank Hampson who, alongside Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence and Ron Turner are well- liked and inspirational artists to Gibbons, whose \\"style evolved out of [his] love for the MAD magazine artists like Wally Wood and Will Elder\\". Working on early feature Ro-Busters (after Starlord merged with 2000 AD), Gibbons became one of the most prolific of 2000 AD's earliest creators, contributing artwork to 108 of the first 131 Progs/issues. He returned to the pages of \\"the Galaxy's Greatest Comic\\" in the early 1980s to create Rogue Trooper with writer Gerry Finley-Day and produce an early run on that feature, before handing it over to a succession of other artists. He illustrated a handful of Tharg's Future Shocks shorts, primarily with author Alan Moore. Gibbons was known, by sight but not by name, to readers of the short-lived IPC title Tornado. Whereas 2000 AD was said to be \\"edited\\" by the alien Tharg, Tornado was \\"edited\\" by superhero Big E, who as alter-ego Percy Pilbeam worked on the magazine. These characters appeared in photographic form within the comic, with Gibbons posing as both Big E and Pilbeam for the entire 22 issue run of Tornado before it was subsumed into 2000 AD. =Doctor Who= Gibbons departed from 2000 AD briefly in the late 1970s/early 1980s to become the lead artist on Doctor Who Weekly/Monthly, for which magazine he drew the main comic strip from issue No. 1 until No. 69, missing only four issues during that time. The Doctor Who Storybook 2007 (released Christmas 2006) features a story called \\"Untitled\\" which includes the name Gibbons in a list of great artists of Earth history. American comics work =1980s= Gibbons was one of the British comic talents identified by Len Wein in 1982 for American publisher DC Comics: he was hired primarily to draw \\"Green Lantern Corps\\" backup stories within the pages of Green Lantern. Gibbons' first DC work was on the Green Lantern Corps story in Green Lantern No. 161 (February 1983), with writer Todd Klein, as well as the concurrently released \\"Creeper\\" two-part backup story in The Flash #318‚Äì319. Gibbons drew the lead story in The Brave and the Bold No. 200 (July 1983) which featured a team-up of the Batmen of Earth-One and Earth-Two. With Green Lantern No. 172 (Jan. 1984), Gibbons joined writer Wein on the main feature while continuing to illustrate the backup features. In issue No. 182, Wein and Gibbons made architect John Stewart, who had been introduced previously in issue No. 87, the title's primary character.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 209: \\"Architect John Stewart was chosen as Green Lantern Hal Jordon's permanent replacement as guardian of space sector 2814 in this issue by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Gibbons.\\" Ceding the \\"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\\" backup features to various other individuals from No. 181, Gibbons last issue with Wein was issue No. 186 (March 1985). Gibbons returned to pencil the backup story \\"Mogo Doesn't Socialize\\" with Alan Moore in issue No. 188. While Marvel Comics reprinted some of Gibbons' Marvel UK Doctor Who work, Eclipse Comics reprinted some of his Warrior work and Eagle reprinted various Judge Dredd tales, Gibbons continued to produce new work almost exclusively for DC throughout the 1980s. For the 1985 Superman Annual No. 11, Gibbons drew the main story \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", again written by Alan Moore.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 214: \\"The legendary writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons teamed up once again with the just-as-legendary Man of Tomorrow for a special that saw Superman...held in the sway of the Black Mercy.\\" During 1985 and 1986, Gibbons' artwork graced the pages of several issues of both DC's Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe and Marvel's The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition. He was one of the contributors to the DC Challenge limited series and in December 1986, he contributed to Harrier Comics' Brickman No. 1 alongside Kevin O'Neill, Lew Stringer and others. Between May and August 1988, he contributed covers to The Phantom miniseries, inked Kevin Maguire's pencilled contribution to Action Comics No. 600, and produced the cover to Action Comics Weekly No. 601. Watchmen The cast of Watchmen, created in 1986 by Gibbons and Alan Moore. He is best known in the US for collaborating with Alan Moore on the 12-issue limited series Watchmen, now one of the best-selling graphic novels of all time, and the only one to feature on Times \\"Top 100 Novels\\" list. Gibbons' artwork in Watchmen is notable both for its stark utilisation of the formulaic comicbook nine-panel grid layout, as well as for its intense narrative and symbolic density,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 220: \\"The story itself was a masterful example of comic book storytelling at its finest...Filled with symbolism, foreshadowing, and ahead-of-its-time characterization thanks to adult themes and sophisticated plotting, Watchmen elevated the super hero comic book into the realms of true modern literature.\\" with some symbolic background elements suggested by Moore, others by Gibbons. Initially pitched by Moore to use the Charlton Comics characters which had been purchased by DC Comics, Watchmen was re-tooled to feature new, analogue characters when it became clear that the story would have significant and lasting ramifications on its main players. Gibbons believes that his own involvement likely came about after the idea was already in its early initial stages. He recalls that he had: To complement the story, Gibbons remembers working on rough character designs which ultimately changed little in their final appearance from \\"the descriptions that Alan had provided,\\" trying to come up with \\"a classic superhero feel but be a little bit stranger ... a sort of operatic look ... an Egyptian kind of a look.\\" Gibbons lettered Watchmen and it was his lettering style that later served as one of two reference sources used by Vincent Connare when creating the controversial font Comic Sans in 1994. Gibbons has commented that \\"It's just a shame they couldn't have used just the original font, because it's a real mess. I think it's a particularly ugly letter form.\\" Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Watchmen \\"called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated\\". DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that \\"As with The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim...and would continue to be regarded as one of the most important literary works the field ever produced.\\" Gibbons returned to Watchmen in 2008, producing the behind- the-scenes book Watching the Watchmen to tie into the release of the 2009 film. Watching the Watchmen is his take on the creation of the seminal work, and features a number of rarely seen pieces of artwork including sketches and character designs, as well as \\"stuff,\\" he says \\"that I just don't know why I kept but I'm really pleased I did.\\" Gibbons stated that \\"I'm basically thrilled with the movie, you know; it's been in the making for years. There have been proposals to make it ‚Äì some I was excited about, some I was less excited about. But I think the way that it finally has been made is just great. I honestly can't imagine it being made much better.\\" =1990s= Give Me Liberty No. 1 (1990) Art by Gibbons; story by Frank Miller From the start of the 1990s, Gibbons began to focus as much on writing and inking as on drawing, contributing to a number of different titles and issues from a variety of companies. Particular highlights included, in 1990, Gibbons writing the three-issue World's Finest miniseries for artist Steve Rude and DC,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 246: \\"Writer Dave Gibbons and artist Steve Rude presented a three-issue miniseries...that proved the World's Finest team of Superman and Batman was still relevant.\\" while drawing Give Me Liberty for writer Frank Miller and Dark Horse Comics. He penned the first Batman versus Predator crossover for artists Andy and Adam Kubert (Dec. 1991‚ÄìFeb. 1992), and inked Rick Veitch and Stephen R. Bissette for half of Alan Moore's 1963 Image Comics series (1993). Rejoining Frank Miller in mid-1994 on Martha Washington Goes to War, the following year Gibbons wrote the Elseworlds title Superman: Kal for Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, melding Arthurian legends to the Superman mythos in an \\"out-of- continuity\\" tale set in an alternate DC Universe. In Marvel Edge's Savage Hulk No. 1 (Jan 1996), Gibbons wrote, penciled, inked, coloured and lettered \\"Old Friends\\", a version of the events of Captain America No. 110 from the point of view of the Hulk. In 1996 and 1997, Gibbons collaborated with Mark Waid and Jimmy Palmiotti on two issues of the Amalgam Comics character \\"Super- Soldier,\\"Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 279: \\"Super-Soldier (an amalgam of Superman and Marvel's Captain America) returned in his second Amalgam one- shot, by writer Mark Waid and penciller Dave Gibbons.\\" a character born from the merging of the DC and Marvel Universes after the events of the 1996 intercompany crossover DC vs. Marvel/Marvel vs. DC. Among many other covers, one-shots and minor works, Gibbons worked with Alan Moore again briefly on the latter's Awesome Entertainment Judgment Day miniseries, providing (variant) covers to all three issues, on the first issue of Kitchen Sink Press' The Spirit: The New Adventures revival and within the pages of the Alan Moore Songbook. He designed the logo for Oni Press in 1997. In 1999 he penciled and inked Darko Macan's four-issue Star Wars: Vader's Quest miniseries. =2000s= Gibbons was one of the artists on the Superman and Batman: World's Funnest one-shot written by Evan Dorkin and in December 2001 Gibbons collaborated with Stan Lee on Just Imagine... Stan Lee creating Green Lantern. Gibbons wrote Captain America issues #17‚Äì20 (Nov. 2003‚ÄìJan. 2004) for artist Lee Weeks. In 2005, he drew covers for JSA, as well as producing the complete original graphic novel The Originals, a black and white graphic novel which he scripted and drew. Published by Vertigo, the work is set in the near future, but draws heavily on the imagery of the Mods and Rockers of the 1960s. He wrote The Rann‚ÄìThanagar War six-issue limited series for DC Comics, one of four lead-ins to the company-wide \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, and returned to the Green Lantern Corps with the five-issue Green Lantern Corps: Recharge (Nov. 2005 ‚Äì March 2006), co-written with Geoff Johns, which spun off into an ongoing, Gibbons-written series in August 2006. Gibbons was involved in two series released by DC/WildStorm when DC acquired American rights to the IPC stable of characters. He provided cover artwork for the flagship title, Albion, the six-issue limited series written by Leah Moore and her husband, John Reppion and co-plotted by her father, Alan Moore. Gibbons wrote the Albion spin-off Thunderbolt Jaxon (April‚ÄìSept. 2006), with art by John Higgins. Gibbons provided covers for three issues of writers Kurt Busiek and Fabian Nicieza's run on Action Comics (issues #841‚Äì843) and co-penciled (with Ethan van Sciver) the Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps issue as part of the \\"Sinestro Corps\\" story arc. He contributed to the ongoing Green Lantern Corps title on issues #18‚Äì20 (May‚ÄìJuly 2007). Gibbons and Ryan Sook produced a Kamandi serial for Wednesday Comics in 2009.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 338 In the late 2000s, he provided new alternative covers to IDW Publishing's reprints of his Marvel UK Doctor Who comics. =2010s= On 9 April 2011 Gibbons was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9am scripting a 20-page black and white Superior comic book, with various artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering. The artists included Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock, Adi Granov, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Olivier Coipel, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, Sean Phillips and Liam Sharp, who all drew a panel each, with regular Superior artist Leinil Yu creating the book's front cover. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on 23 November 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children's Foundation. In 2014 he was appointed the UK's first Comics Laureate, to act as an ambassador for comic books and their potential to improve literacy. Gibbons drew the 1950s variant cover for Action Comics No. 1000 (June 2018). Work in other media Works other than comics include providing the cartoon strip on the inside sleeve of Jethro Tull's 1976 album Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!, background art for the 1994 computer game Beneath a Steel Sky and the cover to K, the 1996 debut album by psychedelic rock band Kula Shaker. In 1988, he did the cover art of album The Madness. In 2007, he served as a consultant on the film Watchmen, which was adapted from the book, and released in March 2009. Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars ‚Äì Director's Cut (2009) featured hand drawn art by Dave Gibbons.

It is a coastal region situated immediately south of Sydney and north of the Shoalhaven or South Coast region. It encompasses the cities of Wollongong, Shellharbour and the town of Kiama. The Illawarra region is characterised by three distinct districts: the north-central district, which is a contiguous urban sprawl centred on Lake Illawarra; the western district defined by the Illawarra escarpment, which leads up to the south-west fringe of Greater Metropolitan Sydney including the Macarthur and Southern Highlands regions; and the southern district, which is historically semi-rural (area undefined), yet now defined by increasing urbanisation.  Etymology  The word \\"illawarra\\" is derived from the Aboriginal Tharawal word \\"allowrie,\\" also sometimes spelled as \\"elouera\\" or \\"eloura.\\" According to A. W. Reed, the word is variously translated as \\"pleasant place near the sea\\" or \\"high place near the sea.\\" The prefix of \\"illa\\" is also known to mean \\"white clay;\\" with the suffix \\"warra,\\" sometimes spelled as \\"wurra,\\" meaning \\"mountain\\" in the local indigenous language. George Bass and Matthew Flinders were the first Europeans to visit the area, with Flinders recording that it 'was called \\"Allowrie\\" by the natives'. For the period around 1806, the region was called \\"Five Islands\\"; referring to the group of five islands off Red Point. In 1817 Governor Macquarie, referring to region, wrote: 'part of the coast known generally by the name of the Five Islands, but called by the natives \\"Illawarra\\".  Geography  Lookout from the Illawarra escarpment above Wombarra over the northern Illawarra plain viewing Austinmer, Thirroul, Bulli, Wollongong up to Port Kembla in the far. Illawarra Escarpment above Austinmer, showing Hawkesbury sandstone, Rainforest and Eucalyptus forest. A section of the Illawarra coastline, circa 1900 The region consists of a grassy coastal plain, narrow in the north and wider in the south, bounded by the Tasman Sea on the east and the mountainous, almost impassable Illawarra escarpment (forming the eastern edge of the Southern Highlands plateau) to the west. In the middle of the region is Lake Illawarra, a shallow lake formed when sediment built up at the entrance to a bay. The district extends from the southern hills of the Royal National Park in the north to the Shoalhaven River in the south, and contains the city of Wollongong, the fourth largest urban area in New South Wales. North of Wollongong the plain narrows to a small strip of land between the coast and the escarpment. At Coalcliff and Stanwell Park small valleys are formed allowing further settlement. To the south it widens, and becomes increasingly hillier before reaching Stockyard Mountain, a long divide between the main plain and the Jamberoo Valley, which stretches until it reaches Kiama. South of Kiama is Saddleback Mountain and south of that the Shoalhaven plains and the outcrop of Coolangatta Mountain. =Ecology= Ecologically, the coastal grassy region of the Illawarra is within the Illawarra Lowlands Grassy Woodland biome. Characteristic tree species in the region include Eucalyptus tereticornis, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Eucalyptus longifolia, Eucalyptus bosistoana and Melaleuca decora. Shrub species include Acacia mearnsii, Dodonaea viscosa and as well as the endangered orchard Pterostylis gibbosa.Illawarra Lowlands Grassy Woodland in the Sydney Basin Bioregion - profile NSW Government ‚Äì Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales) The wet elevated areas of the Illawarra, where rainfall exceeds 1300mm, are within the Southern Lowland Wet Sclerophyll Forests and Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests biomes which generally feature tall, compact eucalyptus forests 30m-60m tall and understorey that include moist shrubs, tree ferns, a few vines and a uninterrupted herbaceous groundcover.Southern Lowland Wet Sclerophyll Forests NSW Government ‚Äì Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests NSW Government ‚Äì Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)  Government administration  For the purposes of Australian federal elections for the House of Representatives, the Illawarra region is contained within the electoral Divisions of Cunningham, Whitlam and the northern tip of Gilmore. For the purposes of New South Wales elections for the NSW Legislative Assembly, the Illawarra region is contained within the electoral districts of Wollongong, Kiera, Shellharbour, Heathcote, and Kiama. For the purposes of local government administration, the Illawarra region is contained within the cities of Wollongong, Shellharbour and the Municipality of Kiama. *The City of Wollongong forms the northernmost boundary, ranging from Helensburgh to Lake Illawarra, with northernmost coastal suburb Helensburgh and southernmost suburbs including Windang, Yallah and Haywards Bay. *The City of Shellharbour is south of Wollongong City, and ranges from Albion Park Rail in the north, west to Macquarie Pass near the escarpment, south to Dunmore near the Minnamurra River, and bordered on the east by ocean stretching from Lake Illawarra, Warilla, Barrack Point and Shellharbour. *The Municipality of Kiama is south of Shellharbour City, and ranges from the Minnamurra River, west to Bald Hill, and south to about south of Gerroa. Economy The main industries in the area have traditionally been farming, coal mining and steel making. Australia's largest steel-works, BlueScope, operates at Port Kembla. The area, especially around Port Kembla and Wollongong, was once known for its mainly industrial jobs, but since the 1990s commerce has played an increasing role in the city, overtaking industry in many areas. Illawarra cattle were originally bred in Illawarra and are now Australia's 3rd largest breed in population. They are large dark red cows sometimes with white patches. They produce large amounts of high butter fat and high protein milk and are suited to the Australian climate. Coal mining has been a key part to the Illawarra's economy for over 200 years. Transport The Illawarra region is linked to Sydney by several passes and a motorway (Southern Freeway) and electric railway (see Illawarra railway line); to the west by the Illawarra Highway and Picton Road; and to the south by the Princes Highway. At Albion Park Rail the Illawarra Regional Airport serves the region.  Sport  = Rugby League Football = The Illawarra Steelers Rugby league Football Club played in the NSWRL rugby league competition, then the NRL, from 1982 to 1998, and currently forms one half of the St George Illawarra Dragons joint venture, who play four of their twelve home games at WIN Stadium in Wollongong. The Illawarra Steelers still field teams in the lower rugby league divisions. Many famous footballers, such as Bob Fulton, Graeme Langlands, Mick Cronin, Rod Wishart, Paul McGregor, Craig Fitzgibbon, Luke Bailey, Steve Roach, Garry Jack, Warren Ryan, and the Stewart brothers Brett and Glenn, have come from the Illawarra region. = Basketball = The Hawks have represented the region (previously known as the Illawarra Hawks and the Wollongong Hawks) since the foundation year of the NBL, 1979. They won the NBL championship in 2001 defeating the Townsville Crocs 2-1 in the best of 3 finals. They also finished as runners-up in 2005 and 2010 seasons. The team caught global attention when American teen sensation LaMelo BallLaMelo Ball announced on ESPN's show The Jump that he will be joining the Hawks through the NBL's Next Star program. In April 2020, LaMelo Ball and his business manager, Jermaine Jackson announced they had bought the Hawks. = Association football = The Wollongong Wolves participated in the now defunct NSL, winning back to back premierships in 2000 and 2001. The Wolves were not selected for the NSL's replacement, the A-League, and instead chose to compete in the New South Wales Premier League under the name Wollongong FC. The Wolves organisation collapsed in 2008, and was taken over by Wollongong Community Football Club. The Wolves have continued to play in the New South Wales Premier League. = Rugby union = The Illawarriors are a Rugby Union club that have contested the Shute Shield since 2007. = Cricket = Cricket has also been played in the Illawarra for at least one hundred and fifty years with the Keira Cricket Club being founded in 1862.

It was Waugh's first published novel; an earlier attempt, titled The Temple at Thatch, was destroyed by Waugh while still in manuscript form. Decline and Fall is based, in part, on Waugh's schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House in north Wales. It is a social satire that employs the author's characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s. The novel's title is a contraction of Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The title alludes also to the German philosopher Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West (1918‚Äì1922), which first appeared in an English translation in 1926 and which argued, among other things, that the rise of nations and cultures is inevitably followed by their eclipse. Waugh read both Gibbon and Spengler while writing his first novel.David Bradshaw, Introduction p. xviii Penguin 2001, Decline and Fall Waugh's satire is unambiguously hostile to much that was in vogue in the late 1920s, and \\"themes of cultural confusion, moral disorientation and social bedlam...both drive the novel forward and fuel its humour.\\"David Bradshaw xxv/xxvi introduction 2001 Penguin edition This \\"undertow of moral seriousness provides a crucial tension within [Waugh's novels], but it does not dominate them.\\"Ian Littlewood, The Writings of Evelyn Waugh Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1983 Waugh himself stated in his 'Author's Note' to the first edition: 'Please bear in mind throughout that IT IS MEANT TO BE FUNNY.' In the text of the 1962 Uniform Edition of the novel Waugh restored a number of words and phrases which he had been asked to suppress for the first edition. The novel was dedicated to Harold Acton, \\"in homage and affection\\".Acton, Memoirs of an Aesthete, p. 203 Plot summary Modest and unassuming theology student Paul Pennyfeather falls victim to the drunken antics of the Bollinger Club and is subsequently expelled from Oxford for running through the grounds of Scone College without his trousers. Having thereby defaulted on the conditions of his inheritance, he is forced to take a job teaching at an obscure public school in Wales called Llanabba, run by Dr Fagan. Attracted to the wealthy mother of one of his pupils, Pennyfeather becomes private tutor to her boy, Peter, and then engaged to be married to her‚Äîthe Honourable Mrs Margot Beste-Chetwynde (who later becomes \\"Lady Metroland\\", and appears in Waugh's other novels).Vile Bodies: A Revolution In Film Art, Evelyn Waugh Newsletter, Winter 1974 Pennyfeather, however, is unaware that the source of her income is a number of high-class brothels in South America. One of the farcical elements of the plot is Pennyfeather's coincidental meetings with his college friend Potts who works for the League of Nations investigating human trafficking. Arrested on the morning of the wedding, after running an errand for Margot related to her business, Pennyfeather takes the fall to protect his fianc√©e's honour and is sentenced to seven years in prison for traffic in prostitution. Margot marries another man with government ties and he arranges for Paul to fake his own death and escape. In the end he returns to where he started at Scone. He studies under his own name, having convinced the college that he is the distant cousin of the Paul Pennyfeather who was sent down previously. The novel ends as it started, with Paul sitting in his room listening to the distant shouts of the Bollinger Club. Critical reception The Guardian, in 1928, praised the book as \\"a great lark; its author has an agreeable sense of comedy and characterisation, and the gift of writing smart and telling conversation, while his drawings are quite in tune with the spirit of the tale\\". The newspaper also compared the superficial presentation in the novel to that employed by P. G. Wodehouse.Decline and Fall by Evelyn Waugh (classics) The Guardian. 12 October 1928 Arnold Bennett hailed it as \\"an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire\\"Quoted in Martin Stannard(editor), Evelyn Waugh, the Critical Heritage, RKP 1984 and the writer John Mortimer called it Waugh's \\"most perfect novel ... a ruthlessly comic plot.\\" In his biography of Waugh, journalist Christopher Sykes recalled, \\"I was in a nursing home when Decline and Fall came out, and Tom Driberg visited me and brought a copy. He began to read out some favourite passages and was literally unable to read them to the end because he and I were so overcome by laughter.\\"Sykes, Christopher. Evelyn Waugh: A Biography. p. 85. In a 2009 episode of Desert Island Discs, the British actor and comedian David Mitchell named Decline and Fall as the book he would take to a desert island, calling it \\"one of the funniest books I've ever read\\" and \\"exactly the sort of novel I would like to have written\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00ln1b2 In other media The novel was dramatised as the 1969 film, Decline and Fall... of a Birdwatcher starring Robin Phillips and also by Jeremy Front in a 2008 BBC Radio 4 production starring Alistair McGowan as Pennyfeather, Jim Broadbent as Grimes, Andrew Sachs as Prendergast, Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Fagan, Jonathan Kidd as Philbrick, Joanna David as Margot Beste-Chetwynde, Emma Fielding as Flossie, and Richard Pearce as Peter. In 2017 the BBC produced a three-part TV dramatisation starring Jack Whitehall as Paul Pennyfeather, David Suchet as Dr Fagan, Eva Longoria as Margot Beste-Chetwynde, Douglas Hodge as Captain Grimes, and Vincent Franklin as Mr Prendergast. The production was the book's first television adaptation, and received largely positive reviews. Alastair Mckay with the Evening Standard called it \\"delicately constructed and pitch- perfect.\\" Ellen E. Jones remarked on the show's \\"many enjoyable performances,\\" especially that of Hodge as the \\"drink-soaked deviant\\" Captain Grimes, adding, \\"Give him a spin-off series immediately.\\" Constance Watson, the great- granddaughter of Evelyn Waugh, found Whitehall's performance \\"funny\\", but said that his character occasionally came \\"across as smug, and his acting seems somewhat self-conscious\\", blaming his deficiencies on a crush on Longoria.

It was founded by Archie Bleyer, who had been the musical director and orchestra leader for Arthur Godfrey in 1952. Bleyer had written a few hot songs in 1932‚Äì34 (Fletcher Henderson's \\"Business in F\\" is a good example) and had a band that recorded for ARC in 1934 and 1935 (his records were issued on Vocalion, Melotone, Perfect and Romeo). The first recording star for Cadence was Godfrey alumnus Julius La Rosa. Other Godfrey alumnae signed to the label included the Chordettes. According to legend, Bleyer was fired from the Godfrey show when he signed someone Godfrey regarded as a rival to a record deal (Godfrey later fired singer Julius La Rosa in October 1954, causing a storm of controversy at the time). The label also produced the early hits of Andy Williams and the Everly Brothers, as well as Johnny Tillotson and Lenny Welch. Virtuoso jazz/classical pianist Don Shirley was signed with Cadence in the 1950s and 1960s. Candid Records was the company's short-lived jazz subsidiary. One of Cadence's most popular songs in the 1950s was \\"Eloise\\", written and sung by Kay Thompson. Cadence charted nearly 100 American singles between 1953 and 1964. It also produced the 1962 smash bestselling parody album The First Family, starring comedic actor Vaughn Meader. Acclaimed at that time as the fastest-selling album in history, this White House satire on the Kennedy family and Capitol Hill politics remained at #1 on the Billboard 200 for 12 weeks. Featuring Meader's impression of President John F. Kennedy, the sketch revue also included takes on First Lady Jackie Kennedy, newsmakers like Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and then Vice-President Lyndon Johnson. A sequel album, The First Family Volume Two, released in March 1963, reached #4. Both albums were immediately recalled and taken out of print following Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. The departures of the Everly Brothers in 1960 (to Warner Bros. Records) and of Andy Williams in 1961 (to Columbia Records), along with radical changes in public taste and the music business brought on by the British Invasion, led to the rapid decline of the company by 1964. Bleyer opted to shut down Cadenceand sold Williams' masters to the singer, which he bought mainly because he wanted to keep any other buyer (Kapp Records and Liberty Records were two companies mentioned interested in buying the Cadence catalog) from reissuing his old material in competition with his new material. Bleyer wanted Williams to buy the entire Cadence catalog, which he did. Williams reissued his old albums on Columbia and formed Barnaby Records to manage the Cadence catalog.

History and facilities Despite being called \\"Elstree Studios\\", only one studio has ever been located in Elstree itself, the remainder residing in the adjacent town of Borehamwood. When the studios were being established, Elstree was significantly larger than Borehamwood. Nowadays, Borehamwood is larger, but the old names have remained in use. The civil parish that contains the town was called \\"Elstree\\". The local railway station was originally known as \\"Elstree\\" (nowadays, it is called \\"\\"). The local telephone exchange was also called \\"Elstree\\". =Eldon Avenue Studios, Borehamwood= The Neptune Film Company opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. Production ceased during 1917, and the studio was sold to the Ideal Film Company who used the site up until 1924. During 1928, the studio was sold to Ludwig Blattner who connected it to the electricity mains and introduced a German system of sound recording. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions during 1934, which purchased the site two years later. Rock Productions built four new large stages. The site was again sold, and taken over by the British National Films Company between 1939 and 1948, although during this period a large portion of the studio was taken over by the British government for war work. During 1953, the studios were bought by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., mainly for television production and were later sold to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV). The Eldon Avenue centre became the main television production hub for ATV. The smaller Studios A and B were used for schools and sitcoms, while Studio C was a drama studio. Studio D, with permanent audience seating, was used for light entertainment programmesBarfe Turned Out Nice Again, p.108 such as the ATV Morecambe and Wise series Two of a Kind (1961‚Äì68) and The Muppet Show (1976‚Äì81).Brian Jay Jones Jim Henson: The Biography, London: Random House, 2013, p.126 When ATV was restructured as Central Independent Television in 1982, one of the conditions of its licence renewal by the governing body of the ITV network, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, was that ATV should leave any London-centric facilities and become more focused on the Midlands, the part of the United Kingdom to which it broadcast ITV programmes. They remained in operation by Central up until July 1983. The BBC bought the Elstree site in 1984 to produce its new soap opera EastEnders (first aired on 19 February 1985). In addition to EastEnders, many other programmes have been made there including Top of the Pops, 'Allo 'Allo!, You Rang, M'Lord?, Grange Hill, Hangar 17 and Holby City. =Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood= The Main Gate entrance at Shenley Road (late 1990s). British National Pictures Ltd. purchased of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. The first film produced there was Madame Pompadour (1927). The company was renamed British International Pictures (BIP) and a second stage was ready for production in 1928. Alfred Hitchcock made Blackmail (1929), the first British talkie at the studios in 1929. At the end of the silent-film era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the British & Dominions Film Corporation. BIP became Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933. During World War II, the studios were used by the War Office for storage.Warren, p.71 In 1946, Warner Brothers acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. In 1969, EMI gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios.Warren, p.76 In 1969, Bryan Forbes was appointed head of production of the film studio (see EMI Films). His tenure was short-lived and marked by financial problems, brought about by deliberately withheld funding and failed projects. Forbes resigned in 1971.Batty D. Bryan Forbes, acclaimed film director, dies aged 86. The Guardian. 8 May 2013. Retrieved 9 May 2013 During the period 1970‚Äì73, when EMI had a short-lived production and distribution deal with the American Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, the facilities were known as the EMI-MGM Elstree Studios. In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as managing director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. This was halted, but only with significant job cuts and closure of some facilities. The studio's immediate survival was secured through the facilities being used for Star Wars (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the Star Wars sequels and Indiana Jones franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in directors Steven Spielberg and Jim Henson. In 1979, Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI after EMI's debacle with its invention of the CT Scanner, and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios. The studios were put up for sale in 1985. Acquired by the entertainment and property company Brent Walker, most of the backlot and several facilities were demolished to build a Tesco superstore. A \\"Save Our Studios\\" campaign led to the site being purchased by Hertsmere Borough Council in February 1996 and management company, Elstree Film & Television Studios Ltd was appointed to run the studios in 2000. Stages at Elstree Studios. The studios at Shenley Road are used for both film and television production, and the studios are the temporary home of BBC Studios and Post Production during the redevelopment of Television Centre. Shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Pointless are recorded there. =Station Road Studios, Borehamwood= A single large stage was built in Station Road in 1928 by Whitehall Films Ltd, but the company was wound up in 1930. In 1935, Julius Hagen, the owner of Twickenham Studios, bought the site and formed a new company, JH Studios. Financial difficulties forced Hagen to sell the studios to MP Productions in 1937. During World War II, the studio was used by the government for storage. In 1950, the site was bought by J. Arthur Rank, who renamed it Gate Studios and made religious films. Production ceased in 1957, and the site was sold to Andrew Harkness, a manufacturer of cinema screens. Harkness Screens moved out of the site in 2004 having established a global manufacturing base in France and the US and relocated its UK operation to a new production facility in Stevenage. The building in Borehamwood was demolished in 2006 to make way for apartments new properties, the development being named Gate Studios in homage to the former site. =British and Dominion Studios, Borehamwood= 1936\\\\. Fire destroys three stages of British and Dominion Studios. From the Illustrated London News 15 February 1936 In 1930, British and Dominion bought three new sound stages from British International Pictures Ltd on the adjoining site before their construction was completed. Alexander Korda made one of his greatest successes at the studio, The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), which starred Charles Laughton as the King. The film's success in the United States and elsewhere persuaded United Artists and The Prudential to invest in Korda's proposed Denham Film Studios.Patricia Warren British Film Studios: An Illustrated History, London: B.T. Batsford, 2001, p.26, 28 Film production continued until 1936 when fire destroyed the three stages.\\"British Film Studios at Elstree Destroyed in $2,250,000 Blaze\\". Calgary Daily Herald. 10 February 1936. p. 9. British and Dominion made a substantial investment in Pinewood Studios and moved production to Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. The support buildings that remained after the fire were sold off to various companies including Frank Landsdown Ltd, which opened a film vault service. The Rank Organisation bought the music stage for the production of documentary films. It later became the headquarters of the film and sound-effect libraries. =MGM British, Borehamwood= Amalgamated Studios Ltd constructed a large studio on the north side of Elstree Way between 1935 and 1937, but its plans collapsed and the facility was soon sold to Rank, who never used it for making films. After a brief period owned by the Prudential, the studios were purchased by the American film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1944 and was renamed MGM- British Studios. After improvements the studio contained seven stages totalling over of floor space. MGM sometimes leased the studios to other film companies including the 20th Century Fox-produced The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), for which a large set of a Chinese town, complete with artificial lakes, covering some 500,000 square feet, was constructed.Warren, p.85 Several stages were taken up with the sets for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) over its extended production schedule, and indeed Stanley Kubrick's film is sometimes blamed for making the studios financially unviable. The facility continued to be used until 1970 when MGM closed the studios. The American company formed a short-lived deal with EMI, while the site of its former studios was redeveloped for industrial use and housing. =Danziger Studios, Elstree= In 1956 the Danziger brothers converted a wartime plane engine testing factory into a studio they called New Elstree,Tise Vahimagi \\"Danzigers, The\\", BFI screenonline which was located to the west of the Aldenham reservoir. It was used mainly for television production and second features, but was closed by 1962 and sold in 1965. =Millennium Studios, Elstree Way, Borehamwood= Established in 1993, the Millennium Studios on the south side of Elstree Way offered television and film production space together with associated services. Millennium Studios have now relocated to Thurleigh near Bedford. =Sky Studios Elstree= In December 2019, media conglomerate Sky announced plans to develop a new studio facility at Rowley Lane. The new studios are expected to open in 2022, and to have 14 stages with the smallest being approximately . The site is also expected to house post- production facilities and an on-site screening cinema.

Early life Bleyer was born in the Corona section of the New York City borough of Queens. His father was a well-known trumpet player who had played with the Metropolitan Opera.\\"Musician Archie Bleyer, Fired By Godfrey.\\" Los Angeles Times, March 22, 1989, p. 20 The younger Bleyer began playing the piano when he was only seven years old. In 1927 he attended Columbia College, intending to become an electrical engineer, but as a sophomore switched to a music major. Without graduating, he left to become an arranger.Andy Rooney, \\"Bleyer Was Musician's Musician.\\" Marietta (GA) Journal, March 29, 1989, p 6 In the early 1930s, Bleyer wrote a number of songs that were recorded; all 'hot' novelty numbers, including \\"Mouthful O'Jam\\", \\"Business In F\\" and \\"Business In Q\\". In 1934, he began to lead his own band at Earl Carroll's club in Hollywood, California. Bleyer's orchestra recorded for Vocalion Records in 1934 and in 1935 moved to the ARC group of labels (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole). One of the vocalists who worked with this orchestra was Johnny Mercer, who later became known as a songwriter and co-founder of Capitol Records. In 1945, Bleyer began a collaboration on the CBS radio network as the orchestra conductor for the popular Gordon MacRae Show. Included among the instrumentalist who appeared with his orchestra was John Serry Sr., who emerged in later years as a leading orchestral accordionist. The Godfrey years He became Arthur Godfrey's musical director in 1946, remaining in this role until 1953. Many close to Godfrey considered Bleyer's creativity and understanding of music to be pivotal to the success of Godfrey's radio and TV programs. And while Godfrey was known to be short-fused and controlling, he often deferred to Bleyer's judgment in the areas of presentation and production. Bleyer founded Cadence Records in 1952. The label's first artist was Julius La Rosa, a member of the Godfrey cast along with vocalists Janette Davis, Frank Parker, Marion Marlowe and the integrated vocal group The Mariners. At the time, La Rosa was the show's most popular cast member. Along with several instrumental hit singles of his own, Bleyer signed many other artists who had performed on Godfrey's programs including The Chordettes, one of whose members, Janet Ertel, became his wife in 1954.\\"Archie Bleyer to Wed Singer.\\" New York Times, November 9, 1954, p. 23 In the fall of 1953, Godfrey dismissed La Rosa on the air and later claimed the young singer \\"lacked humility\\", which heavily damaged Godfrey's popularity. La Rosa had hired a personal manager, going against an unofficial Godfrey policy. That same day, Godfrey fired Bleyer, apparently offended when Bleyer recorded spoken recitations by Chicago radio personality Don McNeill, host of Don McNeill's Breakfast Club. This long-running Godfrey- like show was based in Chicago and broadcast nationally, but its popularity was mainly in the Midwest and tailored to that audience. Always insecure, Godfrey felt McNeill, whose show had once been a competitor, was still in competition though Godfrey was the dominant personality of his generation. Godfrey later claimed when he confronted Bleyer and threatened to fire him from at least one of the three shows Godfrey hosted, the conductor shrugged and told him to do what he had to do.'' Radio historian John Dunning has suggested, in On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, that Bleyer's relationship with Janet Ertel was also a factor in Godfrey's decision to fire him; Godfrey tried to enforce a no-dating policy among his cast and fired several who dated each other. After leaving the show, Bleyer never made a public comment about his days with Godfrey. The public furor that surrounded LaRosa's firing and, to a lesser extent, Bleyer's, began the slow unraveling of Godfrey's seemingly unstoppable dominance of radio and TV as Bleyer's career was just beginning to blossom. The loss of Bleyer's expertise in staging and production matters, where he served as an informal mentor to Godfrey despite their age differences, was detrimental to Godfrey's programs. Cadence Records While LaRosa was unable to sustain his early successes, later Cadence artists included Andy Williams and the label's biggest act of all, The Everly Brothers whose hits such as \\"Bye Bye Love\\" and \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\" were produced by Bleyer in Nashville with country studio musicians led by Chet Atkins. Bleyer circa 1963 was also the step father-in-law of Phil Everly. He had his own instrumental recording hits on the Cadence label as well. Don Shirley appeared on the label in 1955 with \\"Tonal Expressions\\". It became a Top 15 album in the spring of that year, reportedly selling more than 20,000 copies, a respectable debut for a jazz artist. It was the only chart album Shirley was to enjoy, but his sales remained steady enough that he was with the label until it closed in 1964, recording more than a dozen long-play releases.Don Shirley Discography Bleyer also had his limits to his tolerance for rock and roll. While he clearly, and correctly, viewed the Everlys as a commercially appealing, clean-cut act whose country-influenced harmonies could reach a vast following, he was not so tolerant of pioneer garage-rock guitarist Link Wray. In 1957, Bleyer reluctantly agreed to release his no- frills, roaring instrumental \\"Rumble\\" on Cadence in part due to his daughter's fascination with the song. Wray had a contract with Cadence, but in 1958 after he submitted a newly recorded album of similarly raw material recorded in Nashville, Bleyer was convinced the instrumental music was morally and musically inappropriate and shelved the album and canceled Wray's contract. The material wouldn't see the light of day for decades until it was acquired by the British Rollercoaster label. Cadence had a short-lived jazz subsidiary, Candid, which lasted for about a year from 1960 (it was reactivated under new owners several decades later). Cadence had another major hit in 1962 with comic Vaughn Meader's album The First Family, which featured Meader's comedic sketches and his peerless impersonations of President John F. Kennedy. The album was an enormous seller, as was a followup, until Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Cadence always maintained a small roster of artists. Other Cadence hits included 14 chart hits by Johnny Tillotson, ten by The Chordettes, four by Lenny Welch, and two by Don Shirley. In 1964, Bleyer, who was unable to accept the changing pop music market at the dawn of the British Invasion era, sold the Cadence label and all its recordings (except for certain material which he kept to himself, like the Link Wray album). The buyer was Cadence artist Andy Williams, who formed Barnaby Records to manage the Cadence catalog. Bleyer moved with his wife Janet to her hometown of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where he died in 1989 of the effects of Parkinson's disease.'Archie Bleyer, 79, Music Director, Dies,' New York Times, March 21, 1989 Bleyer was a freemason, and a member of St. Cecile Lodge No. 568, New York City.

Wadcutters have also found favor for use in self-defense guns, such as .38 caliber snubnosed revolvers, where, due to short barrel lengths, maximum bullet velocities are usually low, typically under 900 ft/s (274 m/s), and improved lethality is desired. Wadcutters are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. Bullet profile .38 Special wadcutters loaded cartridges, 148 grain hollow- base wadcutter bullet and target showing the clean round holes A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that is typically as wide as the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially designed semi-automatic pistols, although this is not always the case as some wadcutters may have rounded bullet nose profiles. Types of firearm wadcutters Keith-Style SWC with one crimping groove and one filled lubrication groove. In practice, the bullet can be crimped over the leading band, or on the crimping groove, as desired.A variety of wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and SWC (Semi-Wadcutters). HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow at the rear end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for automatic press reloading uses, as they may be used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading. SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with feed ramps on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with gas checks. Properly lubricated SWC bullets with gas checks are suitable for use at velocities exceeding 1700 ft/s (518 m/s), the gas check reducing leading within the bore. =Accuracy= The maximum accurate distance of wadcutters varies considerably with the shape of the front of the bullet. Full caliber diameter wadcutters are suitable for use only at short ranges, typically not being used at ranges exceeding 25 yards where accuracy is especially desirable. At distances beyond 50 yards, full caliber diameter wadcutters become highly inaccurate. On the other hand, SWC bullets can maintain high accuracy at ranges exceeding 100 yards. In general, semi-wadcutters having a partially rounded nose are more accurate than wadcutters having a flat-front profile. In contrast, flat-front profile wadcutters tend to have improved lethality for hunting or self-defense purposes. =Lubrication and bullet crimping= Lead wadcutters require proper lubrication to prevent leading (buildup of lead deposits) of rifling and forcing cones when used in firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940 ft/s. Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both .44 Special and .44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths may need to be set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case. =Indoor wadcutters= Wadcutter bullets for center-fire firearms often have a modified profile with a reduced-diameter central point or rounded section. This was developed to allow the use of wadcutter bullets without causing excessive damage to the rubber anti-splashback curtain on indoor ranges. This profile produces a clean cut without tearing of the paper on the paper target for scoring but will only partially deform a rubber curtain and rebound before penetrating enough to cut the surface of the rubber mat. =Bullet loading techniques= Wadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case opening or they may be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy; the desired powder capacity of the case; or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or non-flush) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters can be used for close-in self-defense and hunting because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy are claimed to increase lethality. Leading effects Wadcutters are typically made from lead. Deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels and into the forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s. A Modern solution to leading at higher velocities is powder coating the lead projectile, encasing it in a protective shell. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques may be used to remove the lead build-up caused from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity. Air rifle and pistol wadcutters A typical 4.5 mm (.177 in) match diabolo air gun pellet, in the HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter) configuration Target airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at muzzle velocities around . The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where paper targets are used, at distances of 25 meters or less.

It is traditionally very long, up to 21 inches (50 cm), and sold rolled in a flat, circular coil, but within western Cumbria, it is more often served in long, curved lengths. Seasonings are prepared from a variety of spices and herbs, though the flavour palate is commonly dominated by pepper, both black and white, in contrast to more herb-dominated varieties such as Lincolnshire sausage. Traditionally no colourings or preservatives are added. The distinctive feature is that the meat is chopped, not ground or minced, giving the sausage a chunky texture. In March 2011, the \\"Traditional Cumberland sausage\\" was granted Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. History The Cumberland sausage has been a local speciality in the area for around 500 years. How the Cumberland sausage came to acquire its special shape and taste is not known. Historically, the sausage was more highly seasoned than it is today, reflecting a strong influx of spices into Whitehaven during the 18th century. During this time, Cumbria was introduced to ginger, black pepper, and nutmeg, as well as other foodstuffs such as molasses, sugar, and rum. Many of these ingredients have been incorporated into some of Cumbria's local specialities, such as the spicy Cumberland sausage. Ingredients Cumberland sausage is typically filled with chopped or coarsely minced pork, to which is added pepper, thyme, sage, nutmeg and cayenne, and some rusk as a binder. The meat content is usually 85‚Äì98%. However, the popularity of the Cumberland sausage has become so widespread in recent years that many large food producers started to mass-produce it and sacrificed its original quality with a meat content as low as 45%, containing emulsified rather than coarse- cut meat and being sold in thin links rather than thick, continuous lengths. Until the 1950s, most local farms and many households kept a pig as part of their regular husbandry and means of self-sufficiency. Over time, a local variety of pig was bred that was suited to the cooler and wetter climate in Cumberland, known as the Cumberland pig. The Cumberland pig was a heavy pig with an upturned snout and ears that flopped forwards. Heavy boned, slow to mature, and extremely hardy, the creature became a symbol of the region, but was allowed to die out in the early 1960s at Bothel. As an alternative, Large Black, Gloucestershire Old Spots, and Welsh breeds can be used. The Cumberland pig breed has now been revived, although not officially recognised by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. Protected Geographical Status A campaign was made by some Cumbrian butchers and meat manufacturers to have Cumberland sausage placed under a Protected Geographical Status classification under European Commission rules. This would provide the same protection as is afforded to Parma ham and Feta cheese. The association suggested that the criteria for the sausages should include a high meat content of more than 80%; the sausage to be coiled, not linked; a wider diameter than conventional sausages; and a rough-cut texture. The association asserts the sausage should be prepared in Cumbria. While individual butchers have their own recipes, they are generally more highly seasoned than traditional sausages, possibly due to the historical import of spices at Whitehaven. However, opposition arose to the campaign in its present form, which essentially calls for the modification of the proposition to reduce the region of the proposed protection from the post-1974 'administrative' County of Cumbria ‚Äì which incorporates Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire 'north of the Sands' but without abolishing the original counties ‚Äì to the Traditional County of Cumberland, on native grounds, with provisions including the native right for natives to continue to manufacture the sausage elsewhere. In March 2011, PGI status was granted to the name \\"Traditional Cumberland sausage\\". To display the PGI mark, the sausage must be produced, processed, and prepared in Cumbria and have a meat content of at least 80%. It must include seasoning and be sold in a long coil. However, sausages not meeting these criteria are sold as Cumberland sausages (without claiming PGI). Waitrose supermarket product description: \\"Cumberland sausages\\" made from Hampshire breed pork from Norfolk, Suffolk, and Wiltshire, and made into sausage links, not a coil. A thin \\"chipolata\\" version is also produced.

Taxonomy  The description of the population was revised in 2019, separating a central western population as Chaeropus yirratji and recognised two earlier descriptions as subspecies Chaeropus ecaudatus ecaudatus (found in southeastern Australia) and Chaeropus ecaudatus occidentalis (found in western and southwestern Australia).  Description  It has been believed to be extinct since the mid-20th century, having reportedly vanished from its final refuge in southern Australia by 1945. It was presumably the first of the two species of Chaeropus to go extinct. Eventhough, the pig footed-bandicoot went extinct they were the only marsipulas to walk on reduced digits both on the fore and hind feet.In addition the pig footed- bandicoot diverges from two different species. According to molecular phylogenetic analyses they diverged from other bandicoots like the Peramelidae, and also from the bilbies like Thylacomyidae int he mid-Late Oligocen (Travouillion, Kenny pg5). It is thought to have been distributed in shrubland habitats in the southern regions of Australia's deserts, and its range likely extended to Western Australia. It physically closely resembled the northern pig-footed bandicoot (C. yirratji), but it had fewer holes on its palate and shorter feet. It also had a different dentition than C. yirratji, indicating that it may have had a different diet. The two species were formerly considered conspecific until a study released in 2019 found them to be separate species.

It is located about southeast of Tahiti. Administratively Moruroa Atoll is part of the commune of Tureia, which includes the atolls of Tureia, Fangataufa, Tematangi and Vanavana. France undertook nuclear weapon tests between 1966 and 1996 at Moruroa and Fangataufa, causing international protests, notably in 1974 and 1995. The number of tests performed has been variously reported as 175 and 181. History Moruroa Even though ancient Polynesians knew Mururoa Atoll by the ancestral name of Hiti-Tautau-Mai, there is no firm historical evidence that it has been permanently inhabited. The first recorded European to visit this atoll was Commander Philip Carteret on HMS Swallow in 1767, just a few days after he had discovered Pitcairn Island. Carteret named Mururoa \\"Bishop of Osnaburgh Island\\". In 1792, the British whaler was wrecked here, and it became known as Matilda's Rocks. Frederick William Beechey visited it in 1826. =French nuclear weapons testing= KH-7 satellite reconnaissance image of the Mururoa Atomic Test Site in French Polynesia, May 26, 1967 Mururoa, and its sister atoll Fangataufa, were the site of extensive nuclear testing by France between 1966 and 1996, as well as the site of numerous protests by various vessels, including the Rainbow Warrior. The atoll was officially established as a nuclear test site by France on September 21, 1962, when the Direction des Centres d'Exp√©rimentations Nucl√©aires (DIRCEN) was established to administer the nuclear testing. This followed with the construction of various infrastructures on the atoll commencing in May 1963. The atoll of Hao, to the north-west of Mururoa, was chosen as a support base for the nuclear tests and other operations. Despite objections from some 30 members of the Polynesian Territorial Assembly, the first nuclear test was conducted on July 2, 1966, code named Aldebaran, when a plutonium fission bomb was exploded in the lagoon. Greenpeace states in a 21st-century study that the explosion sucked all the water from the lagoon, \\"raining dead fish and mollusks down on the atoll\\", and that it spread contamination across the Pacific as far as Peru and New Zealand. President Charles de Gaulle himself was present at Moruroa on 10 September 1966 when a test was conducted, using a device suspended from a balloon. Most of these tests were conducted on the western end of the atoll, designated as Dindon. Smaller blasts were detonated on the northern end of the atoll, designated as Denise. Three nuclear devices were detonated on barges, three were air dropped from bombers, and the rest were suspended from helium filled balloons. A total of 41 atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted at Mururoa between 1966 and 1974. The lagoon of Mururoa, 1972 View on Mururoa, 2005 France abandoned atmospheric nuclear testing in 1974 and moved to underground testing in the midst of intense world pressure which was sparked by the New Zealand Government of the time, which sent two frigates in July 1973, HMNZS Canterbury and Otago, to the atoll in protest for a nuclear free Pacific. Shafts were drilled deep into the volcanic rocks underlying the atolls where nuclear devices were detonated. This practice created much controversy as cracking of the atolls was discovered, resulting in fears that the radioactive material trapped under the atolls would eventually escape and contaminate the surrounding ocean and neighbouring atolls, a case of so-called tired mountain syndrome. A major accident occurred on 25 July 1979 when a test was conducted at half the usual depth because the nuclear device got stuck halfway down the 800 metre shaft. It was detonated and caused a large submarine landslide on the southwest rim of the atoll, causing a significant chunk of the outer slope of the atoll to break loose and causing a tsunami affecting Mururoa and injuring workers. The blast caused a 2 kilometre long and 40 cm wide crack to appear on the atoll. French president Jacques Chirac's decision to run a nuclear test series at Mururoa on 5 September and 2 October 1995, just one year before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was to be signed, caused worldwide protest, including an embargo of French wine. Riots took place across Polynesia, and the South Pacific Forum threatened to suspend France. These tests were meant to provide the nation with enough data to improve further nuclear technology without needing additional series of tests. The test site at Mururoa was dismantled following France‚Äôs last nuclear test to date, detonated on 27 January 1996, but the atoll is still guarded by the French Forces. In total, 181 explosions took place at Moruroa and Fangataufa, 41 of which were atmospheric. However, the total number has been variously reported: nuclear scientists working at the site claim 175 explosions in total took place in the Pacific.  Monitoring  A report from 2012 suggested that only 11 of the 20 monitoring system sensors are actually functional, which could mean the atoll could potentially collapse without forewarning of the monitoring system.

Alongside Pat Mills, he helped revitalise British comics in the 1970s, and continues to be active in the British comics industry, occasionally also working in American comics. He is best known as the co-creator, with artist Carlos Ezquerra, of the character Judge Dredd. Wagner started his career in editorial with D. C. Thomson & Co. in the late 1960s before becoming a freelance writer and a staff editor at IPC in the 1970s. He has worked in children's humour and girls' adventure comics, but is most notable for his boys' adventure comics; he helped launch Battle Picture Weekly (1975), for which he wrote \\"Darkie's Mob\\", and 2000 AD (1977), for which he created numerous characters, including Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog, Robo-Hunter and Button Man. In the 1980s, he and co-writer Alan Grant wrote prolifically for IPC's 2000 AD, Battle, Eagle, Scream! and Roy of the Rovers. They also wrote for DC Comics' Batman in the U.S., created a series of Batman and Judge Dredd team-up comics, and started the British independent comic The Bogie Man. Judge Dredd has twice been adapted for film, and David Cronenberg adapted Wagner's graphic novel A History of Violence into the 2005 film of the same name. Wagner continues to write for 2000 AD and Judge Dredd Megazine. Biography =Early life and career= \\"Patridge's Patch\\", from Jet, co-written with Pat Mills, illustrated by Mike Western, 1971. Wagner was born in Pennsylvania, U.S., in 1949,Colin M. Jarman and Peter Acton, Judge Dredd: The Mega History, Lennard Publishing, 1995 the product of a war marriage. When Wagner was twelve his parents separated and his mother returned to Greenock in Scotland with the children.Jack McKeown, \\"Dredd 3D fans owe a debt to the Wormit Thrill Shed , The Courier, 4 September 2012Steven McKenzie, Scotland's influence on 2000AD's Judge Dredd, BBC Scotland, 14 August 2012 Wagner describes himself as \\"a pretty badly adjusted youth\\" in America, fighting and getting into trouble, and says he \\"benefited a lot from the added discipline of life in Scotland.\\" When he left school he joined a printing company, going to college on day release, until his aunt showed him an advert for editorial assistants at D.

IPC managers John Purdie and John Sanders began to take notice. After nine months their writing partnership broke up, and Wagner moved to London to join IPC's staff, editing girls' titles Sandie and Princess Tina until 1973, when both were merged into other titles. After that he quit comics for a time, taking a variety of jobs, including as caretaker of an estate in the Scottish Highlands and dredging on a barge.David Bishop, John Wagner talks about Battle Picture Weekly, Vicious Imagery, 30 January 2007 =Battle, Valiant and Action= \\"Darkie's Mob\\", illustrated by Mike Western, from Battle Picture Weekly In the autumn of 1974 Pat Mills had been tasked with developing Battle Picture Weekly, a new war- themed title for IPC to compete with D. C. Thomson's Warlord. He asked Wagner to join him and help develop characters. Mills and Wagner were dissatisfied with the sanitised nature of boys' comics and wanted to make them harder- hitting, with more working-class heroes. They devised the opening line-up themselves, with the assistance of Gerry Finley-Day, before farming the stories out to other writers. The title was launched with a cover date of 8 March 1975, and was a hit. Wagner continued to write for girls' comics, including scripting gymnastics strip \\"Bella at the Bar\\" for Tammy,Brave Bella Barlow, Tammy's Most Popular Heroine , Books Monthly (undated) and was appointed editor of the ailing boys' weekly Valiant. Characters he created for this title included the tough New York City cop \\"One-Eyed Jack\\", drawn by John Cooper, which was inspired by the film Dirty Harry and became the comic's most popular character,\\"I invented Judge Dredd\\", BBC, 28 February 2002 and \\"Soldier Sharp\\", drawn by Joe Colquhoun, about a cunning coward in World War II. Both strips transferred to Battle when Valiant was merged into it in 1976, with One-Eyed Jack leaving the police and becoming a spy.David Bishop, \\"Blazing Battle Action\\" part 2, Judge Dredd Megazine No. 210, 23 September 2003, pp. 72‚Äì79 Wagner then quit editorial and returned to freelance writing. In 1976‚Äì77 he wrote \\"Darkie's Mob\\" for Battle, a violent series about a renegade British captain leading a group of lost soldiers in a personal war against the Japanese in Burma during World War II, drawn by Mike Western, which became one of the comic's most popular strips, although Wagner has since said he regrets \\"some of the jingoistic, racist language\\" used.Ian Wheeler, \\"John Wagner: The Story Man\\", Eagle Flies Again issue 11, Winter 2004, pp. 5‚Äì6 A collected edition was published by Titan Books in 2011.Darkie's Mob ‚Äì The Secret War of Joe Darkie at Titan Books Other strips he wrote for Battle included \\"Joe Two Beans\\" (1977), about a mute Native American soldier in the Pacific Campaign, drawn by Eric Bradbury, and the naval series \\"HMS Nightshade\\" (1978‚Äì79), drawn by Western. For Mills' short-lived, controversial title Action he scripted the boxing strip \\"Blackjack\\".\\"Blackjack\\" at The Sevenpenny Nightmare During this time he shared a flat on Camberwell New Road in London with future 2000 AD editor Steve MacManus. =2000 AD= In 1976 Mills brought Wagner in as script adviser for the new science fiction comic he was developing, 2000 AD. Wagner suggested the new title needed a cop story, and his proposal, \\"Judge Dredd\\", took the Dirty Harry archetype further, imagining a violent lawman, empowered to dispense justice on the spot in a future New York. Artist Carlos Ezquerra was asked to visualise the character, but Wagner initially hated the elaborate look Ezquerra came up with, thinking it \\"way over the top\\". When a proposed buy-out of 2000 AD that would have improved creators' terms and conditions fell through, Wagner walked away from the comic,David Bishop, Thrill Power Overload, Rebellion, 2002‚Äì2009 leaving Mills to develop the character by commissioning stories from freelancers. The first published episode appeared in issue 2, based on a script by Peter Harris, rewritten by Mills and drawn by Mike McMahon, which alienated Ezquerra. Wagner returned to write the character from issue 9, and has written the majority of Judge Dredd stories since. Ezquerra returned in 1982 to draw the \\"Apocalypse War\\" storyline, and continued to draw the character semi-regularly until his death in 2018. Wagner created two long-running series in 1978. One, \\"Robo-Hunter\\", a private detective-style character who specialised in robot-related cases, was initially drawn by Jos√© Ferrer, but his pages were partly redrawn by Ian Gibson, who became the strip's regular artist. The other, \\"Strontium Dog\\", a sci-fi western about a bounty hunter in a future where mutants are an oppressed minority forced into doing such dirty work, was created by Wagner and Ezquerra for Starlord, a short-lived sister title to 2000 AD with higher production values. Starlord was later merged into 2000 AD, bringing \\"Strontium Dog\\" with it. =Doctor Who= During their writing partnership, Wagner and Mills had submitted story ideas to the BBC for the TV series Doctor Who in the 1970s,Dave Gibbons, Pat Mills, John Wagner and Steve Moore, Doctor Who: The Iron Legion, Panini Books but Wagner eventually dropped out, tired of the endless rewrites requested, an experience which turned him off TV writing. Mills' involvement came to an end when the show's script editor changed. Artist Dave Gibbons was aware of this, and when he was offered the chance to draw the lead strip in Doctor Who Weekly in 1979, he suggested them as writers. The pair wrote four eight-part serials, based on their unmade TV scripts. They adapted them separately, Wagner scripting \\"City of the Damned\\" and \\"Dogs of Doom\\", and Mills scripting \\"The Iron Legion\\" and \\"The Star Beast\\", although all were credited to \\"Mills & Wagner\\". =Partnership with Alan Grant= John Wagner at a comic convention in New York City in 1992. From 1980 to 1988 he wrote in partnership with Alan Grant, an old friend and former D. C. Thomson and 2000 AD sub-editor with whom he was sharing an old farmhouse in Essex, although most stories were credited to Wagner alone (under one of his pseudonyms) or Grant alone ‚Äì whichever of them typed the script up got the cheque.David Bishop, \\"Interrogation: Alan Grant\\" part 2, Judge Dredd Megazine #267, 5 February 2008, pp. 16‚Äì22 Wagner (as John Howard or T. B. Grover) was credited with \\"Judge Dredd\\", and Grant with the less frequent \\"Robo-Hunter\\", \\"Strontium Dog\\", and the Judge Dredd spin-off \\"Anderson, Psi Division\\", while some strips, like the CB-inspired space haulage comedy \\"Ace Trucking Co.\\", were credited to \\"Grant/Grover\\". \\"Judge Dredd\\" was credited to \\"Wagner/Grant\\" starting in 1986.2000 AD prog 493, IPC Magazines Ltd, cover date 25 October 1986 Other pseudonyms were created, at the insistence of publisher John Sanders, to disguise how prolific the two writers were. For the revived Eagle they wrote \\"Doomlord\\", \\"Joe Soap\\", \\"Rebel the Police Dog\\", \\"Computer Warrior\\", \\"The Fists of Danny Pyke\\", \\"Manix\\" and \\"The House of Daemon\\"; for Scream! they wrote \\"The Thirteenth Floor\\",Alex Frith, , 2000 AD Review (undated, via Internet Archive) for Roy of the Rovers they wrote \\"Dan Harker's War\\", and for Battle they wrote \\"Invasion 1984\\".David Bishop, \\"Blazing Battle Action\\" part 4, Judge Dredd Megazine No. 212, 18 November 2003, pp. 72‚Äì79 During this time Wagner wrote the documentary strip \\"Fight for the Falklands\\" for Battle, without Grant who had no interest in war stories, and \\"Dan Dare\\" with Pat Mills for Eagle.Dan Dare at Barney's 2000 AD Database Wagner and Grant became part of the so-called \\"British Invasion\\" of American comics during the 1980s. In 1987 their first title, a mini-series called Outcasts, was published by DC Comics with Cam Kennedy as artist. Outcasts was well received, though it never sold in great quantities, and this success led to the pair writing Batman in the pages of Detective Comics from issue 583, largely with Norm Breyfogle on art duties. Grant and Wagner introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story and the Ratcatcher in their third. The pair also created the bleak nuclear dystopia The Last American for Epic Comics with longtime Dredd artist Mike McMahon. Arguments over the direction of that title and the ending of the Judge Dredd story \\"Oz\\" led to the end of their writing partnership and they split their work between them: Wagner kept \\"Judge Dredd\\", while Grant continued \\"Strontium Dog\\" and \\"Anderson, Psi Division\\" and became the sole writer of Detective Comics. Although the two continue to collaborate from time to time, they have never resumed a full-time partnership. =Creators' rights= In 1987, IPC's comics division was sold to Robert Maxwell as Fleetway Publications. John Davidge was appointed as publishing director in 1989, and within a matter of weeks was confronted by Wagner, who emptied a large bag of Judge Dredd merchandise onto his desk, pointed out he had received no royalties for any of it, and threatened a creator walk-out over the issue. Davidge, whose background was in magazine and book publishing, was shocked, and introduced written contracts and royalty payments for comic creators. =The Bogie Man and the 1990s= One series Wagner and Grant did continue writing together was The Bogie Man, about an escaped mental patient who thinks he's Humphrey Bogart, or rather a composite of the characters he played, and constructs imaginary cases by associating random events with events in Bogart films. They had previously pitched the series, unsuccessfully, to DC before writing Outcasts. It was first published as a four-part miniseries by the Scottish independent Fat Man Press in 1989, intending to tie in with Glasgow's position as European City of Culture in 1990, and further stories followed from other publishers. Wagner and Grant were named as consulting editors on a new title, the Judge Dredd Megazine, in 1990. Wagner did most of the development work, and wrote three of the five strips in the opening line-up, including \\"America\\", illustrated by Colin MacNeil, which examined the totalitarian nature of the Judge system through the story of a young woman who becomes a pro-democracy terrorist, and \\"Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend\\", with art by Peter Doherty, which told the origin of Dredd's arch-enemy Judge Death in humorous style. While his efforts were concentrated on Dredd in the Megazine, Wagner took a break from writing the character in 2000 AD, replaced by Garth Ennis, Grant Morrison, Mark Millar and others. He did not resume writing for 2000 AD for more than three years. Wagner was initially involved in Toxic!, an independent weekly anthology launched in 1991, but, aside from two Bogie Man serials co-written with Grant, most of his proposed stories were rejected and he withdrew from the project. One such proposal, \\"Al's Baby\\", a comedy about a male mob hitman who becomes pregnant, drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, ran in the Judge Dredd Megazine in 1991. Another, \\"Button Man\\", a contemporary urban gladiator thriller drawn by Arthur Ranson, was published in 2000 AD in 1992. Both spawned sequels. Wagner and Grant reunited in 1992 for Judgement on Gotham, a hit graphic novel teaming up Judge Dredd and Batman, co-published by Fleetway and DC and featuring painted art by Simon Bisley. Further team-ups between Dredd and Batman followed, but were beset by production delays.David Bishop, \\"Interrogation: Alan Grant\\" part 3, Judge Dredd Megazine #268, pp. 16‚Äì22 In the mid-1990s Wagner worked on a number of licensed properties for Dark Horse Comics in the US, including Aliens, Star Wars - notably solo stories starring Boba Fett, Dark Horse Comics, 1997 (via Internet Archive) and the comics strand of the multimedia project Shadows of the Empire - and Xena: Warrior Princess.John Wagner interview, Westfield Comics, July 1999 In 1997 he wrote his first original graphic novel, A History of Violence, a contemporary thriller about an unassuming small-town man whose background in gang crime comes back to haunt him, drawn by Vince Locke for the Paradox Press imprint of DC Comics. It was nominated for the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario in 2006. =21st century= In 2000 Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra revived \\"Strontium Dog\\" (main character Johnny Alpha had been killed off in 1990 in a story written by Alan Grant), based on a treatment Wagner had written for an abortive TV pilot. Initially, stories were set before the character's death in a revised continuity, but 2010's \\"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\\" brought Johnny back from the dead.Tony Ingram, Mutant Mayhem in Milton Keynes: The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha, Strontium Dog , Broken Frontier, 19 August 2011 Wagner has continued to be the main writer of \\"Judge Dredd\\" in 2000 AD and the Judge Dredd Megazine. In 2003 he co-wrote the Judge Dredd/Aliens crossover, \\"Incubus\\", with Andy Diggle, which was co-published by Dark Horse Comics and 2000 AD. Since 2005 he has shared the character with other writers, including Gordon Rennie, Robbie Morrison, Si Spurrier, Al Ewing and Michael Carroll. Major storylines he has contributed include \\"Origins\\" (2006‚Äì2007), exploring how the Judge system was established, and \\"Day of Chaos\\" (2011‚Äì2012), in which many of the institutions of Dredd's world are destroyed, leaving a more dangerous city. In 2016 Wagnor teamed up with Grant to create a new comic for BHP Comics. Drawn by Dan Cornwell \\"Rok of the Reds\\" tells the story of a dangerous intergalactic outlaw, Rok of Arkadi, who, while on the run, hides on the planet earth by taking over the body and life of troubled football star Kyle Dixon. A father of two, Wagner lives with his wife near Shrewsbury, Shropshire.Shropshire restaurant name immortalised in Dredd 3D, Shropshire Star, 9 August 2012Rick Fulton, \\"Scots comic legend on the end of an era.. and dawn of a new Dredd\\", Daily Record and Sunday Mail, 7 September 2012 Style and influence Pat Mills describes Wagner's writing as \\"romantic but not emotional\\". His depictions of violent action, from \\"Darkie's Mob\\" to \\"Judge Dredd\\" to A History of Violence, are unsentimental and laced with mordant humour. Other strips, like \\"Robo-Hunter\\", \\"Ace Trucking Co.\\" and \\"The Balls Brothers\\", reveal a more overt comedy side to his writing. He is well known for writing terse scripts, described by artist Dave Gibbons as being like \\"exciting telegrams\\".Thom Young, Watching the Watchmen with Dave Gibbons: An Interview, Comics Bulletin (undated) He says he does not think visually, but rather \\"in terms of plot developments [and] dialogue\\", preferring to leave the visual decisions to the artist.Laura Sneddon, Comic Studies: Dundee Comics Day, Comic Book Resources, 2 November 2011 Described by Warren Ellis as \\"probably the single most influential writer in British comics\\",Warren Ellis, Come In Alone issue #14, Comic Book Resources, 3 March 2000 Wagner is named as an influence by writers such as Alan Grant, who says he \\"taught me almost all I know about comic writing\\",Oor Authors, ItchyCoo Garth Ennis,Comic Book Day: Getting Closure with Garth Ennis , Nerdist News, 29 February 2012 Andy DiggleCut to: Andy Diggle (Comic Book Writer) , My PDF Scripts, 2012 and Rob Williams.Multiversity Comics Presents: Rob Williams , 19 September 2011 Alan Moore was inspired by the work of Wagner and Pat Mills in 2000 AD to try and express his ideas in mainstream comics.Gary Spencer Millidge, Alan Moore: Storyteller, Ilex, 2011, p. 58 Wagner's own influences include the comics of D.

Wagner and Grant made very little money out of it. Wagner felt that the screenwriter did a poor job adapting it, and Coltrane did not understand the character. 1995 saw the release of Judge Dredd, a big budget version of the comic directed by Danny Cannon and starring Sylvester Stallone. Wagner was unhappy with the result, feeling they had filmed \\"the wrong script\\" and that \\"Stallone was badly advised\\".

An adaptation of the 1944 novel of the same name by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon's book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights. The story mainly concerns the culture clash of the Imperialist Victorian values of the British Empire with the autocratic rule of Siam's King Mongkut. The successful film starred Rex Harrison as the king and Irene Dunne as Anna. At the 19th Academy Awards ceremony, the film received two Oscars; for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, William S. Darling, Thomas Little, Frank E. Hughes). Also nominated were Bernard Herrmann for the score, the screenwriters and supporting actress Gale Sondergaard. Landon's novel was later adapted by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their 1951 stage musical The King and I and subsequent 1956 film of the same name. American film director Andy Tennant remade the film in 1999 as Anna and the King with Jodie Foster and Chow Yun- fat. The portrayal of Tuptim in Anna and the King of Siam is considerably less sympathetic than in the musical version The King and I, as the 1946 film shows animosity between Tuptim and Anna, while the musical makes her into a romantic character. Also, Tuptim is ultimately executed cruelly by the king, following an episode in Leonowens's book, while in the musical her fate is made ambiguous.Ma, Sheng-mei. \\"Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'Chopsticks' musicals\\". Literature/Film Quarterly, Vol. 31, Number 1 (2003), pp. 17‚Äì26. Plot In 1862, Anna OwensThis shortened form of \\"Leonowens\\" is used in the film. arrives in Bangkok, with her son Louis, to tutor the children of the King. She believes she is sufficiently acquainted with Asian customs to know what is proper in Siam, having read a book summarizing the same. However, when the Kralahome or Prime Minister comes out to welcome her, he asks her a number of personal questions, and she does not know that this is common courtesy in Siam. Her letter from the King asking her to come to Siam includes a promise that she will have a house of her own away from the Palace, but the Kralahome says she will have to stay in the harem for now (although she'll have a private room there). Anna goes to the Kralahome's office the next day and apologizes for her misunderstanding, asking him to introduce her to the King so she can get the house business straightened out and start her school. He says it is New Year in Siam and the King is busy with many festivities and ceremonies, but he will work her into the schedule. When he does so, he tells her that it is polite to prostrate oneself before the King; Anna refuses, and says she will bow as she would to her own Queen. Mongkut challenges her with personal questions; she responds with nonsensical answers. Liking her spirit, he introduces her to his many wives and his 67 children, asking that she instruct the wives in English as well as the children. She is enchanted, but reminds him that he promised her a house. He refuses to remember that he promised such a thing and insists she live in the palace, where she will be more accessible in case students (or the King himself) have questions. When she insists, she is shown a sleazy house in the fishmarket, but rejects it and stays in the palace, starting her school there. Lady Thiang, the head wife knows English and translates. Among other things, Anna teaches proverbs and songs about promises and home or houses. Soon even the royal secretary is singing \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" under his breath as he works. Meanwhile, the Kralahome comes in and tells Mongkut that Cambodia, once a part of Siam, has sold out to the French, who have established a protectorate. The King says his plan is to hold onto Siam, to save what he can. He finally cedes to Anna on the matter of the house; she likes it, but plans to leave. However, the Kralahome tells her to stay, because Mongkut is a complex man who needs her influence. Mongkut begins summoning Anna in the middle of the night to discuss how the Bible should be interpreted, and other scholarly matters. On the way back from one of these sessions, she discovers a chained slave with a baby. This is L'Ore, who belongs to Lady Tuptim, the new favorite. Tuptim is very young and very bitter about being brought to the Palace and shut up behind the walls, even though the King likes her. She refuses to let L'Ore go, even though L'Ore's husband has offered to pay for her. As he has done several times in the past, Crown Prince Chulalongkorn questions her about these matters, but she puts him off. Lady Thiang, the crown prince's mother, is concerned, but Anna gives her the brush-off too, saying they will talk \\"later, when she has time\\". Anna tells the King about L'Ore, reminding him that it's his own law that slaves must be freed if the money is offered. This law protects all. The King asks if Queen Victoria is above the law. Anna explains that she is not and neither is President Lincoln. She tells about the fight against slavery in America, and about the Civil War. He writes to Lincoln offering to send pairs of elephants that can be used as army transport (an actual incident); Lincoln writes back, thanking him for the offer but explaining that elephants would not do well in American climates. Tuptim shows Anna a jeweled glass pomegranate the King gave her for freeing her slave, but then believes that the King listened to Anna about this, not to her. \\"If I am not first here, what is left for me?\\" Mongkut expects English visitors and asks Anna to dress some of his prettiest wives in European style and to provide English-style decor and utensils to show that he is not a barbarian. Much is at stakeforeign papers have written very biased things about Siam, and Britain is thinking about establishing a protectorate. Anna suggests that the King invite consuls to come from other countries at the same time. The party is a great success, combining British, European and Siamese traditions and convincing the visitors that Siam is indeed a civilized nation with a very old and very proud history. Lady Tuptim, who's been missing for some time, is found in a Buddhist temple, disguised as a young man. She is put on trial and explains; she couldn't stand being shut up, and so disguised herself and went to the monastery because she had nowhere else to go. She was accepted as a novice and studied with Phra Palat, her former fianc√©, who'd taken holy vows when Tuptim was presented to the king. No one believes that she was simply in disguise and that Phra Palat had no idea who she was. Anna runs to the King and begs his help, but he's very insulted that Anna even knows about what happened‚Äîit's a private matter as well as something that harms his dignity. Anna unwisely loses her temper and tells the king he has no heart and that he's a barbarian. Protesting her innocence and Phra Palat's, Tuptim is burned at the stake and he with her. Anna decides that she has had enough and says goodbye to the children. The royal wives read her a letter pleading with her to stay. Lady Thiang is disappointed with Anna, explains her life story through the illustrations on her wallpaper, and says that the crown prince may not grow up to be a good king if Anna doesn't stay to educate him. At the same time, Louis dies in a riding accident. The Kralahome comes to her and reads a proclamation from the King granting Louis royal funeral honours. He explains that the King does this by way of apology for what happened with Tuptim. But when the King asks Anna to continue secretarial duties, she says \\"It's the children I want,\\" and goes on with her school. The British open a consulate in 1865, the French in 1867, and the US in 1870. Many years pass, and the crown prince is now a young man. Anna is summoned to the bedside of the King, who is dying. The King says that Anna spoke the truth to him and was a good influence on the children. He expresses his gratitude and dies. The Kralahome asks Anna to stay and help the prince. When Chulalongkorn is crowned, his first act is to abolish the practice of prostration before the King, so that everyone can respect each other and work together. Cast Historical inconsistencies There are a number of differences between the plot of this film and historical fact, including: * Anna was Anglo-Indian, raised in India, and not Welsh, as she claimed; she had never even visited Britain before becoming a governess in the court of Siam. Also, she was the widow of a civilian clerk and hotel- keeper, not a British army officer. * King Mongkut had been a Buddhist monk for 27 years before succeeding his brother as king. This is actually brought out quite prominently in one scene. His portrayal as an arrogant tyrant is debated. The film and musical production were based on Margaret Landon's 1944 novel, Anna and the King of Siam, which was in turn based on Leonowens' accounts of her experiences. To set the record straight, Thai intellectuals Seni Pramoj and Kukrit Pramoj (brothers) wrote The King of Siam Speaks in 1948. () * Tuptim's torture and execution by burning at the stake is disputed by a great-granddaughter of the King who claimed also to be Tuptim's granddaughter.Princess Vudhichalerm Vudhijaya (b. 21 May 1934), stated in a 2001 interview, \\"King Mongkut was in the monk's hood for 27 years before he was king. He would never have ordered an execution. It is not the Buddhist way.\\" She added that the same Tuptim was her grandmother and had married Chulalongkorn. Nancy Dunne, \\"'Life as a royal is not for me': A Thai princess tells Nancy Dunne the truth about The King and I and how she prefers a simple life in the U.S.\\", Financial Times (25 August 2001), p. 7. This type of execution was never done in Siam according to former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun.Panyarachun is quoted in a 1998 article in the Thai newspaper The Nation, reprinted article at Anna and the King Articles. * Mongkut really did write a letter to Washington offering elephants to be used as stock for breeding American elephants, but the offer was unrelated to the Civil War. His letter, accompanied by some gifts, was addressed to President James Buchanan during the last month of his term, \\"or to whomsoever the people have elected anew as Chief ruler in place of President Buchanan\\". The response, dated almost a year later, came from President Abraham Lincoln, thanking the king for the gifts and good wishes, but declining the elephants on the grounds that the latitude of the U.S. made raising elephants impractical. * The Siamese theatricals presented at the dinner party in the film are accompanied by music that seems to be sourced from the Folkways album Music of the Orient (1979 remastered edition available). The soundtrack cuts back and forth between a piece labeled Gamelan Gong: Lagu kebiar which is not Siamese but Balinese, and what appears to be a Thai piece used to accompany dramatic performances. The recording labels it as \\"Musical Drama: Scene from the Rama Legend\\". The Balinese music is in a style known as gong kebyar, which didn't exist in the 1860s. However, the background music by Bernard Herrmann is clearly based on Thai traditional court music in the mahori style, particularly the use of the ranat xylophone. * Anna's son Louis dies as a child in a riding accident in the film, and Anna's decision to remain in Siam is prompted both by the King's sincere regret for her loss and her own maternal instincts: Prince Chulalongkorn becomes a sort of foster son for Anna. The historical Louis Leonowens did not die as a child, and in fact outlived his mother. * In the film, Anna is present at the death of King Mongkut. The historical Anna had been granted a leave of absence for health reasons in 1867 and was in England at the time of the King's death in 1868; she was not invited to resume her post by the new king.

Biography Title page from Nachman Krochmal's Guide for the Perplexed of Our Time.He began the study of the Talmud at an early age. At age fourteen he was married, according to the custom of the time, to the daughter of the wealthy merchant Habermann. He then went to live with his father-in-law at Zhovkva, near Lemberg, where he devoted himself entirely to his studies, beginning with Maimonides' The Guide for the Perplexed, and studying other Hebrew philosophical writings. Krochmal then proceeded to study German and the German philosophers, especially Immanuel Kant, to read Latin and French classics, and Arabic and Syriac books. After suffering a breakdown from overwork in 1808, he went to Lemberg for medical treatment; and the friendship he there formed with S.L. Rapoport, whose teacher he became, was most fruitful for Jewish science. On his return to ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, after having partially recovered, he again took up philosophy, reading Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and subsequently Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose system chiefly attracted him and exerted a great influence on his views. Aside from Rapoport, who often visited him in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, he gathered around him a group of young students. In 1814, after the death of his wife's parents, he was compelled to earn a livelihood, and he became a merchant. Twelve years later he lost his wife, and his health became very poor. In spite of failure in business, poor circumstances, and loneliness, he refused an invitation to the rabbinate of Berlin, and instead obtained a position as bookkeeper in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, which he held from 1836 to 1838. A serious illness then compelled him to retire to his daughter's house in Tarnopol; and here two years later he died. Career Krochmal was a brilliant conversationalist and an exceedingly careful student. For a long time he could not be persuaded to publish any of the results of his studies, in consequence of aspersions cast upon him on account of his friendly correspondence with the hakham of the neighboring Karaite community of Kokusow. Krochmal defended himself in a circular letter against these accusations. He was not a prolific writer. Besides some Hebrew essays in periodicals (Sulamith, 1818; Ha-·∫íefirah, Zolkiev, 1824; and Kerem ·∏§emed, vols. iv., v.), he wrote only one Hebrew book, namely, Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman (Lemberg, 1851), edited, according to the author's last will, by Leopold Zunz, whom he admired as a great scholar though he never met. Other editions appeared in Lemberg in 1863 and Warsaw in 1898. =Moreh Nebukhe ha-Zeman= Moreh Nebukhe ha-Zeman (Guide for the Perplexed of the Time) is divided into seventeen chapters, of which the first six deal with religion in general. Ch. vii describes Israel's spiritual gift as the desire for and faculty of seeking God. The next three chapters contain a philosophical analysis of Jewish history, which, corresponding to Israel's attachment to the Lord, that is, to its religious development, is divided into three epochs. These epochs terminate respectively: (1) with the death of Gedaliah after the destruction of the Temple; (2) with the death of Bar Kokba (ca. 135); and (3) with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492). The author does not characterize the modern period in which he himself lived. Ch. xi-xv deal with the post-exilic Biblical and the Apocryphal literature and with the various religious movements. The author discusses also the necessity of tradition and gives a critical r√©sum√© of the development of the Halakhah and Aggadah. Ch. xvi gives a brief sketch of the future development of Jewish religious philosophy based on the principles of Hegel. The work finishes with an exposition of Ibn Ezra's philosophy. The historical digressions in the book touch the profoundest problems of Jewish science; and it remains their indisputable merit to have paved the way for critical studies in Jewish history. The work really became, as intended by the author, a \\"guide\\" to students of Jewish science in the nineteenth century.

It was once a common tradition in saloons and taverns in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a \\"free\\" lunch, which varied from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink. The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day. The hardships of the Depression marked the curtailing of the widespread practice for reasons of economy, and it never really returned. This was noted in Carroll John Daly‚Äôs 1944 detective story ‚Äú Body, Body, Who‚Äôs Got the Body?‚Äù. The protagonist, hard-boiled investigator Race Williams, meets a woman in New York at a fancy Park Avenue cafe. Grumbling at the high prices and skimpy portions, he says ‚ÄúI...paid the bill for what would have been a free lunch in the good old days‚Äù. Free food or drink is sometimes supplied in contemporary times, often by gambling establishments such as casinos. The saying \\"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch\\" refers to the practice, meaning that you always end up paying in some way for something offered for free. In PEC perspective, this concept is used as the strategy that is used to attract certain audiences to make more profits by broadcasters. They are selling the time, audience's attentions and general consciousness to the capitalists.  History  In 1875, The New York Times wrote of elaborate free lunches as a \\"custom peculiar to the Crescent City\\" (New Orleans), saying, \\"In every one of the drinking saloons which fill the city a meal of some sort is served free every day. The custom appears to have prevailed long before the war .... I am informed that there are thousands of men in this city who live entirely on the meals obtained in this way.\\" As described by this reporter, > A free lunch-counter is a great leveler of classes, and when a man takes up > a position before one of them he must give up all hope of appearing either > dignified or consequential.

An 1872 New York Times story about \\"loafers and free-lunch men\\" who \\"toil not, neither do they spin, yet they 'get along,'\\" visiting saloons, trying to bum drinks from strangers; \\"should this inexplicable lunch-fiend not happen to be called to drink, he devours whatever he can, and, while the bartender is occupied, tries to escape unnoticed.\\"\\"The Loafer and Free-Lunch Men;\\" The New York Times, June 30, 1872, p. 6 In American saloon bars from the late 19th century until Prohibition, bouncers had, in addition to their role of removing drunks who were too intoxicated to keep buying drinks, fighters, and troublemakers, the unusual role of protecting the saloon's free buffet. To attract business, \\"... many saloons lured customers with offers of a \\"free lunch\\"‚Äîusually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon \\"bouncer\\" was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites\\".Drinking in America: A History - Search for Consensus: Drinking and the War Against Pluralism, 1860-1920 ‚Äì Lender, Mark Edward & Martin, James Kirby, The Free Press, New York, 1982 The custom was well-developed in San Francisco. An 1886 story on the fading of the days of the 1849 California Gold Rush calls \\"the free lunch fiend the only landmark of the past.\\" It asks \\"How do all these idle people live\\" and asserts, \\"It is the free lunch system that keeps them alive. Take away that peculiarly California institution and they would all starve.\\"\\"Old Things Passing Away,\\" The New York Times, March 5, 1886, p. 2 Rudyard Kipling, writing in 1891, noted how he > came upon a barroom full of bad Salon pictures in which men with hats on the > backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter.

An 1874 history of the movement writes: > In the cities, there are prominent rooms on fashionable streets that hold > out the sign \\"Free Lunch.\\" Does it mean that some [philanthropist] ... has > gone systematically to work setting out tables ... placing about them a > score of the most beautiful and winning young ladies ... hiring a band of > music?

Thus consummate art plies the work > of death, and virtue, reputation, and every good are sacrificed at these > worse than Moloch shrines., p. 133 A number of writers, however, suggest that the free lunch actually performed a social relief function. Reformer William T.

This article is about the director's cut, lasting 123 minutes, which is the only circulating version of the film. The hastily censored theatrical cut, lasting 118 minutes, has completely lost its viewership since the director's cut became available to the North American public in 2012.  Plot  On 28 April 1876, Leopold, His Grace the 3rd Duke of Albany, is a stifled dreamer. He has created a design for a primitive elevator, and has built a small model of this device. His strict Uncle Millard has no patience for what he sees as Leopold's frivolous interest in the sciences and new inventions, having brought him to New York City in order to marry a wealthy American heiress, as the Mountbatten family is heavily indebted. While sketching the Brooklyn Bridge during a public meeting dedicated to the completion of its Manhattan tower, Leopold notices Stuart Besser taking photographs with an anachronistically small camera. Stuart is an amateur physicist (and great‚Äëgreat‚Äëgrandson of Leopold) from 21st‚Äëcentury New York who has discovered the existence of gravitational time portals. Later, Leopold catches Stuart in the Duke's study, photographing his schematic diagrams. When Stuart attempts to flee, Leopold follows and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into the time portal. Leopold awakens on a Wednesday morning in the year 2001 in Stuart's apartment at 88 White Street, Manhattan. Stuart explains that the portal they have travelled through has closed, but will reopen on the next Monday, until which time Leopold should stay in Stuart's apartment. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the empty elevator shaft, and, after ranting about his scientific discovery in the hospital, is involuntarily committed to a mental institution. According to Stuart's concept, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a widespread \\"occlusion\\" of elevators, and may cause the disappearance of Stuart himself if Leopold doesn't go back on Monday. Leopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay, Stuart's ex-girlfriend who lives downstairs. He observes that she is a \\"career woman\\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog for a walk. Back at the apartment, he befriends Charlie, Kate's brother and an aspiring actor, who believes him to be an actor as well, steadfast to his character. On Thursday morning, Kate becomes impressed by Leopold's eloquent exposition of how important the tastiness of food is to the quality of human life. She takes him to an audition for a TV commercial pitching a fat-free butter, Farmer's Bounty, produced by the British company Jansen Foods, which is being taken over by Kate's company, Camden Research Group (CRG). On Friday, Leopold hires a violinist and invites Kate to a rooftop dinner, which ends with a waltz and the first kiss. They become romantically entangled and spend Saturday touring New York. In the evening, he tries to propose to her, but she falls asleep on his lap. On Monday, Leopold acts in a Farmer's Bounty commercial, but walks off the set upon finding the diet margarine disgusting. Leopold chastises Kate about integrity, to which she counters that he lacks connection with reality. Realizing that their time together is nearly over, both spend the evening in subdued contemplation. On Tuesday morning, Stuart escapes from the asylum and sends Leopold to his own time, which makes the elevators work again. Charlie notices Kate in a photo taken at Leopold's ball on 28 April 1876, and shows the photo to Stuart, who realizes that Kate's future is in the past. That night, when Kate is about to accept her promotion at the merger banquet, Stuart and Charlie tell her that she has to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes. Kate rejects their suggestion as absurd and goes to give her acceptance speech, during which she sees herself, wearing the same evening dress, in one of Stuart's pictures. She abruptly ends the speech, and the three of them rush to the bridge. Having made it through the portal, Kate appears in 1876. Just when Leopold is about to announce his bride of convenience, Kate storms into the ballroom, and he instead announces her name, styled as \\"Kate McKay, of the McKays of Massapequa\\". Among the shocked guests, Kate and Leopold reunite with a kiss and dance a bridal waltz. Thus Kate turns out to be Stuart's great‚Äëgreat‚Äëgrandmother.  Cast   Alternative versions  References suggesting that Kate is Stuart's great-great-grandmother were censored from the film just a few days before the theatrical release.

The Paykan ( meaning Arrow) is the first Iranian made car produced by Iran Khodro (formerly called \\"Iran National\\") between 1967 and 2005. The car was very popular in Iran from its introduction until its discontinuation. It is often colloquially referred as the Iranian chariot. The Paykan was a Hillman Hunter built under licence, but had some unique body work and locally-developed variants (most notably, the pickup, which used a different body shell from the one sold elsewhere). History The design was introduced to Iran by Mahmoud Khayami, co-founder and, by then, owner of the Iran Khodro (formerly called \\"Iran National\\") company and factory, who accurately predicted that Iran was in need of a simple \\"no-frills\\" motorcar within the price range of ordinary people. In 1967, Rootes began exporting Hillman Hunters to Iran Khodro in \\"complete knock down\\" (CKD) kit form, for assembly in Iran. By the mid-1970s, full-scale manufacturing of the car (minus the engine) had started in Iran. In 1977, Roy Axe designed a new Paykan facelift model using many interior and exterior parts from the Chrysler Alpine. In 1978, Peugeot took over the Rootes company after it collapsed under the ownership of Chrysler Europe; a year later, Peugeot ended Hillman Hunter production in Ireland. Following this, the Paykan's engine production tooling was moved to Iran and was in full-scale manufacturing under Peugeot licence. This ended in 2005 with the final Paykan leaving the assembly line. Irankhodro tried to replace Paykan with a so called \\"New Paykan\\" but Peugeot did not agree with the naming. This revealed the fact that the intellectual ownership of the Paykan brand and logo still belongs to the PSA (Peugeot Soci√©t√© Anonyme) as a legacy of the demise of Rootes group. Design Although the Paykan was based on a 1966 Hillman Hunter, there were many changes and modifications made to it over the years ‚Äì notably the substitution of the original 1725cc Rootes engine with a Peugeot 504-derived unit. The modifications to the exterior included revised headlights and taillights. A Paykan Pickup was also offered.Iran Khodro Paykan Pick up, tocmp.org Retrieved 15 February 2016 There was another pickup truck based on the Hillman Hunter sold in South Africa ‚Äì the Dodge Husky ‚Äì but the two models used different bodies. The South African version has a thicker B-pillar and retains the saloon's lines along the side panels. The tailgate and rear window are also subtly different. The Iranian government reportedly offered Iran Khodro a large cash incentive to end Paykan production by 2005, labelling the car as an environmental hazard because of its unacceptably high fuel consumption. During its last years, the order backlog was nearly two years long. The Samand, commonly referred to as the \\"New Paykan\\", is currently being produced by Iran Khodro as a modern substitute for the Paykan class of cars. In 2005, Iran Khodro announced that it had sold the discontinued Paykan's motorcar production line to the Khartoum Transport Company in Sudan, while car-parts production for the Paykan still continues by third party manufacturers in Iran.

Known for inciting patriotic rebellion among the Filipino clergy, he was also a political activist who became acquainted with Isabelo de los Reyes, who would start an Independent Christian Filipino Church named after Aglipay in 1902. Aglipay was previously excommunicated by Archbishop Bernardino Norzaleda y Villa of Manila in May 1899, upon the expressed permission of Pope Leo XIII. Aglipay later joined Freemasonry in May 1918. Aglipay later married Pilar Jamias y Ver from Sarrat, Ilocos Norte in 1939 and then died one year later. Followers of Aglipay through the church colloquially sometimes refer to their membership as Aglipayans. Early life Born in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Aglipay was an orphan who grew up in the tobacco fields in the last volatile decades of the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. He bore deep grievances against the colonial Spanish government of the islands, stemming from abuses within the agricultural system. Arrested at fourteen when a tobacco-picking worker for not meeting his tobacco quota, he later moved to the capital of Manila to study law under the private tutelage of Julian Carpio.University, Princeton. \\"The Catholic Historical Review, Volume 4\\". American Catholic Historical Association, 1919, p. 320. After two years of study under Carpio, Aglipay continued his studies at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and at the University of Santo Tomas. After obtaining his degree, he then entered the seminary in Ilocos Sur in 1883 and was ordained to the priesthood seven years later. He began a career as an assistant priest in various parishes around the main northern island of Luzon. While in Victoria, Tarlac, Aglipay gave aid to the revolutionaries and employed thirty carpenters who in reality were revolutionists in touch with the Katipunan group. Despite being a priest, Aglipay, like other revolutionaries, joined Freemasonry. Revolution In 1898, the Katipunan was led by the Supremo, Andr√©s Bonifacio. Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda asked Aglipay to confront the revolutionary leaders, offering them a level of autonomy in the future for the Philippines if they would end the rebellion. Emilio Aguinaldo, in turn, sent Colonel Luciano San Miguel to Aglipay with the intention of getting him to join the rebellion. In the course of Aglipay's journey north, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War started. When Aglipay returned to Manila and discovered that the Americans had attacked, he joined the revolution. On 20 October 1898, Gen. Aguinaldo appointed Aglipay Military Vicar General of the revolutionaries. Aglipay interpreted this as making him Ecclesiastical Superior to all Filipino priests who, as such, should all be appointed Military Chaplains for the duration of the war.\\"The First Obispo Maximo, Monsignor Gregorio L. Aglipay\\", Iglesia Filipina Independiente, note 16 Fighting which broke out between the U.S. and Filipino forces on February 4, 1899 prompted Aglipay to withdraw to Ilocos Norte to organize an armed resistance. On 29 April 1899, Aglipay was excommunicated for \\"usurpation of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.Iglesia Filipina Independiente Following the end of the war in 1902, Isabelo de los Reyes was working towards the formation of a national church, that is independent of Rome. On 3 August he suggested that Aglipay be its first bishop. Aglipay, a devout Catholic at the time, was reluctant, but accepted de los Reyes' offer to establish an independent church. On 18 January 1903, Aglipay was appointed Supreme Bishop of the \\"Philippine Independent Church\\". As Supreme Bishop he allied himself with the nationalist and most radical political parties during his time like the Sakdalistas and later on even with the Socialist and Communist Parties. During the theological discussions while visiting other churches while travelling abroad, Aglipay rejected the belief in the Trinity, becoming theologically accepting of the main Unitarian belief however, his own church refused to accept his amended theology. Aglipay's unitarian and progressive theological ideas were evident in his \\"novena\\", \\"Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak\\", 1925Aglipay, Gregorio, Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak , 1925 and its English translation, \\"Novenary of the Motherland\\", 1926.Aglipay, Gregorio, Novenary of the Motherland , 1926 Bishop Gregorio Aglipay bust (Samal, Bataan, \\"Iglesia Filipina Independiente\\" (Philippine Independent Church). Later life Aglipay ran for elections as President of the Commonwealth along with the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas Norberto Nabong in a joined Republican-Communist Party ticket in 1935, but lost to Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a of the Nacionalista Party. He married D. Pilar Jamias year in 1939 since his church permits married clergy, but Aglipay died the following year on 1 September 1940.

Relatively small for eagles and contrastingly patterned like a falcon, this species was earlier placed in the genus Hieraaetus and sometimes also in the genus Aquila but thought to be distinctive enough to belong to a separate genus. Taxonomy and systematics A captive adult rufous-bellied eagle. This eagle was originally described as Astur kienerii on the basis of a specimen from the Himalayas. It was later moved to Limnaetus by Jerdon, the genus Lophotriorchis and still later to Hieraaetus, the so-called \\"hawk-eagles\\". A study of the phylogeny of some Hieraaetus species and other eagles indicated that they were nested within the Aquila clade of eagles, resulting in their repositioning. Another molecular study of the eagles suggested that kienerii was distinctive enough to be retained in a separate genus for which the name Kienastur had been suggested but as this occurred in a thesis it is invalid for taxonomic purposes, and in any case Lophotriorchis was proposed much earlier (though originally shared with the Black-and-chestnut eagle which is nowadays placed in Spizaetus). Within its wide range, two subspecies are recognized although there is no marked plumage difference. The nominate kienerii of India and Sri Lanka (the northern birds are larger); and formosus described by Erwin Stresemann in 1924 which is widely distributed across Southeast Asia from Burma to Sulawesi. Description Adult rufous-bellied eagles are distinctive in their pattern. They have a black hood with a short crest. Chestnut underparts and wing coverts contrast with the white on the throat and breast. The sexes are almost indistinguishable in plumage but females are slightly larger and have more black on the face. They perch in a very upright stance and the wingtip almost reaches the tail. The tarsus is fully feathered. Juveniles have very white underparts with dark markings on the sides of the body, head mask and edge of underwing coverts. They can appear similar to a booted eagle (Aquila pennata). In flight, the underwing lining is dark and the greater coverts are black. The flight feathers are thinly barred with a black edge. The tail is dark and barred. Distribution and habitat left The rufous-bellied eagle is found in southern and south-eastern Asia and its range also extends to Sulawesi. This species is associated mainly with hill forests. In India, they are commoner in the Western Ghats than along the Himalayas where they occur from Nepal to Assam. They also occur in parts of the Eastern Ghats. Behaviour and ecology Rufous-bellied eagles are usually seen in flight, soaring high over the forest canopy. They dive to capture prey that can include birds and mammals in the air, canopy, or forest floor. Birds the size of the Sri Lanka wood pigeon, Kalij pheasant and junglefowl have been recorded as prey. The breeding season of the eagles is in winter with the young fledging in spring when the prey species are also breeding. The display flight involves stooping and wing-quivering. Their calls include a series of high pitched fwick, fwick... notes followed by a thin sweek!. They nest on a large, often bare tree, building a large platform of dry sticks and branches that they break off. The nest is lined with green leaves and a single egg is laid. Both parents take turns in incubation, feeding and nest defence.

Edward Bond wrote the screenplay, which is loosely based on the 1959 novel Walkabout by James Vance Marshall. Set in the Australian outback, it centres on two white schoolchildren who are left to fend for themselves in the Australian outback and who come across a teenage Aboriginal boy who helps them to survive. One of the first films in the Australian New Wave cinema movement, it received positive reviews despite being a commercial failure. Alongside Wake in Fright, it was one of two Australian films entered in competition for the Grand Prix du Festival at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. It is also held to be one of Roeg's masterpieces, along with Performance (1970), Don't Look Now (1973), and The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of the \\"50 films you should see by the age of 14\\".  Plot  A white, city-bred teenaged schoolgirl, her younger brother and their father drive far into the Australian outback, ostensibly for a picnic. The father goes berserk and suddenly begins shooting at the children. They run behind rocks for cover, whereupon he sets the car on fire and shoots himself in the head. The girl conceals the suicide from her brother, retrieves some picnic food, and leads him away from the scene, attempting to walk home through the desert. By the middle of the next day, they are weak and the boy can barely walk. Discovering a small water hole with a fruiting tree, they spend the day playing, bathing, and resting. By the next morning, the water has dried up. They are then discovered by an Aboriginal boy. Although the girl cannot communicate with him, due to the language barrier, her brother mimes their need for water and the newcomer cheerfully shows them how to draw it from the drying bed of the oasis. The three travel together, with the Aboriginal boy sharing food he has caught hunting. The boys learn to communicate slightly using words and sign language. While in the vicinity of a plantation, a white woman walks past the Aboriginal boy, who simply ignores her when she speaks to him. She appears to see the other children, but they do not see her, and they continue on their journey. The children also discover a weather balloon belonging to a nearby research team working in the desert. After drawing markings of a modern-style house, the Aboriginal boy eventually leads them to an abandoned farm, and takes the small boy to a nearby road. The Aboriginal boy hunts down a water buffalo and is wrestling it to the ground when two white hunters appear in a truck and nearly run him over. He watches in shock as they shoot several buffalo with a rifle. The boy then returns to the farm, but passes by without speaking. Later, the Aboriginal boy lies in a trance among a slew of buffalo bones, having painted himself in ceremonial markings. He returns to the farmhouse, catching the undressing girl by surprise, and initiates a mating ritual by performing a courtship dance in front of her. Although he dances outside all day and into the night until he becomes exhausted, she is frightened and hides from him, and tells her brother they will leave him the next day. In the morning, after they dress in their school uniforms, the brother takes her to the Aboriginal boy's body, hanging in a tree. Before leaving, the girl wipes ants from the dead boy's chest. Hiking up the road, the siblings find a nearly deserted mining town where a surly employee directs them towards nearby accommodation. Much later, a businessman arrives home as the now grown-up girl prepares dinner; while he embraces her and relates office gossip, she imagines a scene in which she, her brother, and the Aboriginal boy are playing and swimming naked in a billabong in the outback. Cast * Jenny Agutter as Girl * Luc Roeg (credited as Lucien John) as White Boy * David Gulpilil (miscredited as David Gumpilil) as Black Boy * John Meillon as Father * Robert McDarra as Man * Pete Carver as No Hoper * John Illingsworth as Husband * Hilary Bamberger as Woman * Barry Donnelly as Australian Scientist * Noeline Brown as German Scientist * Carlo Manchini as Italian Scientist Themes Jenny Agutter regards the film as multilayered; on one hand it is a story about children lost in the outback finding their way, and on the other it is an allegorical tale about society and the loss of innocence. Louis Nowra noted that biblical imagery runs through the film; in one scene there is a cut to a subliminal flashback of the father's suicide, but the scene plays in reverse and the father rises up as if he has been \\"resurrected\\". Many writers have also drawn a direct parallel between the depiction of the Outback and the Garden of Eden, with Nowra observing that this went as far as to include \\"portents of a snake slithering across the bare branches of the tree\\" above Jenny Agutter's character as she sleeps. Gregory Stephens, an associate professor of English, sees the film framed as a typical \\"back to Eden\\" story, including common motifs from 1960s counterculture; he offers the skinny-dipping sequence as an example of a \\"symbolic shedding of the clothes of the over-civilized world\\". By way of the girl's rejection of the Aboriginal boy and his subsequent death the film paints the Outback as \\"an Eden that can only ever be lost\\". Agutter shares a similar interpretation, noting \\"we cannot go back and have that Garden of Eden. We cannot go back and make it innocent again.\\" Agutter considers the ages of the two adolescents, who are on the cusp of adulthood and losing their childhood innocence, as a metaphor for the irreversible change wrought by Western civilisation.  Production  The film was the second feature directed by Nicolas Roeg, a British filmmaker. He had long planned to make a film of the novel Walkabout, in which the children are Americans stranded by a plane crash. After the indigenous boy finds and leads them to safety, he dies of influenza contracted from them, as he has not been immunised. Roeg had not been able to find a script he was happy with, until the English playwright Edward Bond did a minimal 14-page screenplay. Roeg then obtained backing from two American businessmen, Max Raab and Si Litvinoff, who incorporated a company in Australia but raised the budget entirely in the US and sold world rights to 20th Century Fox. Filming began in Sydney in August 1969 and later moved to Alice Springs, and Roeg's son, Luc, played the younger boy in the film. Roeg brought an outsider's eye and interpretation to the Australian setting, and improvised greatly during filming. He commented, \\"We didn‚Äôt really plan anything‚Äîwe just came across things by chance‚Ä¶filming whatever we found.\\" The film is an example of Roeg's well-defined directorial style, characterised by strong visual composition from his experience as a cinematographer, combined with extensive cross-cutting and the juxtaposition of events, location, or environments to build his themes. The music was composed and conducted by John Barry, and produced by Phil Ramone, and the poem read at the end of the film is Poem 40 from A.E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad.  Reception  Walkabout fared poorly at the box office in Australia. Critics debated whether it could be considered an Australian film, and whether it was an embrace of or a reaction to the country's cultural and natural context. In the US, the film was originally rated R by the MPAA due to nudity, but was reduced to a GP- rating (PG) on appeal. Critic Roger Ebert called it \\"one of the great films\\". He writes that it contains little moral or emotional judgement of its characters, and ultimately is a portrait of isolation in proximity. At the time, he stated: \\"Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication.\\" Film critic Edward Guthmann also notes the strong use of exotic natural images, calling them a \\"chorus of lizards\\". In Walkabout, an analysis of the film, author Louis Nowra wrote: \\"I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting.\\" Walkabout features several scenes of animal hunting and killing, such as a kangaroo being speared and bludgeoned to death. The Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937 makes it illegal in the United Kingdom to distribute or exhibit material where the production involved inflicting pain or terror on an animal. Since the animals did not appear to suffer or be in distress the film was deemed to not contravene the Act. The film includes scenes of nudity featuring Jenny Agutter, who the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) surmised was 17 years old at the time of filming. The scenes did not pose a problem when submitted to the BBFC in 1971 and later in 1998. The Protection of Children Act 1978 prohibited distribution and possession of indecent images of people under the age of 16 so the issue of potential indecency had not been considered on previous occasions. However, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 raised the age threshold to 18 which meant the BBFC was required to consider the scenes of nudity in the context of the new law when the film was re-submitted in 2011. The BBFC reviewed the scenes and considered them not to be indecent and passed the film uncut. = Legacy = Commenting on the film's enduring appeal, Roeg described the film in 1998 as \\"a simple story about life and being alive, not covered with sophistry but addressing the most basic human themes; birth, death, mutability.\\" More than 40 years after its release, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 84% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10.

The series was created by writer John Wagner (under the pseudonym T. B. Grover) and artist Carlos Ezquerra for Starlord, a short-lived weekly science fiction comic, in 1978. When Starlord was cancelled, the series transferred to 2000 AD. In 1980, Wagner was joined by co-writer Alan Grant, although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series solo from 1988 to 1990. After Ezquerra's death in October 2018 the series was put in indefinite hiatus with no current plans for its continuation (other than some single-episode stories in special issues aimed at younger readers). Series background The premise of the series is that the Great Nuclear War of 2150 wiped out 70% of Britain's population and led to a huge increase of mutant births due to exposure to nuclear fallout (strontium-90). The mutants faced a high degree of racism, similar to that faced by the Jewish population of Nazi Germany. Laws were passed forbidding mutants from owning businesses and segregating them into ghettos such as a giant mutant settlement at Milton Keynes. Following the end of this storyline, in 2180, one of the few jobs left for mutants is that of bounty hunter, a job considered too dangerous for normal humans. The strongest of mutants hunt down criminals throughout the galaxy for the Search/Destroy agency, whose distinctive SD badges give them the nickname Strontium Dogs. The SD agents operate from an orbiting space station known as The Doghouse. The mutants of Strontium Dog differ from the usual depiction of mutants in American comics, such as those published by Marvel, in that they are generally afflicted with severe physical deformities and only rarely granted with superhuman powers. Often this leads to humour and character names being puns, as Spider-Dan in the Young Middenface spin-off and skull-faced Welsh mutant Dai the Death in Strontium Dog: Traitor To His Kind. Even by the standards of 2000 AD, Strontium Dog plotlines can be bizarre. In one story, Alpha travels to an alternate dimension that passes for Hell. In another, he is sent by time machine to 1945 to arrest Adolf Hitler. There is a bleak, minimalistic edge to the series at times reminiscent of spaghetti westerns. =Earth= Earth is rarely seen in the strip. When it is, the focus is often New Britain ‚Äì Great Britain after a devastating nuclear war. It is much closer to modern-day Britain than Judge Dredd's Brit-Cit by the same writers, but contains areas of nuclear devastation such as the Greater London Crater and Birmingham Gap; areas known to survive include Salisbury (now a major area and political centre), Glasgow, Newcastle, Dover, Christchurch & Bournemouth (now a combined conurbation), Cardiff, Isles of Scilly, and Winchester. The flying building of Upminster contains both the parliament and the monarchy. In the sequel series Strontium Dogs, it was stated that Britain had a large empire of outer-space colonies. The mutants of New Britain live in ghettos, isolated from the human population and living in poverty. Later stories like Traitor To His Kind would reveal some figures in the government, such as the First Lord of the Military (himself having a mutant daughter) are attempting to slowly improve the mutants' lot, but much of this goes unnoticed behind the scenes; many other figures in the government want to go back to greater oppression or attempted extermination. In The Final Solution, the government was usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed; the first Strontium Dogs story had it that after the destruction of the New Church by the Strontium Dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. Crossroads, in prog 898, revealed that Earth was in a severe political mess, with twenty six \\"minor wars\\", and the rest of the galaxy was cutting ties. The later strip The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha ignored all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government. Ireland is known to still exist, though little has been shown; the United States of America and Canada were both visited in The Mork Whisperer (2009); and the leader of a West African Mutant Republic was shown in The Final Solution. Antarctica was the setting of part of Outlaw, shown to have been turned into a tropical area with marshes and rainforests by the Rad Wars. The centre was Antarctic City (also the name of a megacity in Judge Dredd), with military and police matters handled by the Antarctic Militia. Johnny Alpha The Strontium Dogs storyline focuses on John Alpha, whose mutated eyes allow him to see through walls and read minds. He is responsible for such legendary achievements as destroying the Wolrog homeworld, leading the mutant uprising on Earth, and bringing Adolf Hitler to the future to face trial. His legendary career and his assistance to mutants in trouble - such as donating a large sum of money to the Milton Keynes ghetto in \\"Mutie's Luck\\" - have made him an icon to Earth's mutants. He is a highly skilled and dangerous fighter. A dogged bounty hunter, Johnny never gives up in the pursuit of his quarry. While he does work for money, he possesses a conscience and will often take a job, forego payment or sometimes drop a job entirely: in \\"The Doc Quince Case\\", he immediately relented and rescued a man he'd hunted down, and in \\"The Slavers of Drule\\" he took an assignment to track down a group of slavers because he felt it was the right thing to do. He also can be extremely vengeful when angered, as shown by his actions towards Nelson Kreelman and Max Bubba. He is the son of Nelson Bunker Kreelman, a bigoted politician who drafted the anti-mutant laws and gained power on the back of bigotry. Despised, abused and hidden away by his father, Johnny escaped at a young age and joined the Mutant Army, becoming one of its key leaders by age 17 and playing a major part in the mutant uprising of 2167. He never revealed the identity of his father, changing his name from Kreelman to Alpha. He has a \\"norm\\" sister called Ruth, who is married and has a husband (Nigel) and daughter. She and her family have traditionally been friendly to Johnny; she even helped him escape and caused Nelson Kreelman's blackmail during the Mutant Army uprising of 2167. However, after her daughter was abducted and almost killed by a criminal looking for revenge on Johnny, she forbade him from coming near her family again. Alpha has a norm half- brother, the son of Nelson Kreelman by an affair, called Nelson Culliver, who after the war became head of the Anti-Mutant Squad at Scotland Yard. In \\"Traitor to His Kind\\", Culliver tried to have Alpha murdered, but was exposed and fired from his job. Alpha decided to assassinate him, but relented on meeting his children. =Weapons/equipment and mutant abilities= Like all Search/Destroy agents, Alpha is armed with highly advanced technology including a variable-cartridge blaster, electrified brass knuckles, a short- range teleporter, a \\"time drogue\\" that can briefly \\"rewind\\" the last few minutes of time, and \\"time bombs\\" which can transport somebody minutes or hours forwards or backwards in time (by which time the planet has moved along in its orbit, so that the victim reappears in empty space). Over the years, Johnny Alpha's white, incandescent eyes have provided him with several mutant abilities. Most frequently, the high-level alpha radiation emitted from his eyes allows Johnny to see through walls and other solid objects, or to read people's minds. He has also used his piercing stare to inflict severe headaches on his opponents, or to \\"suggest\\" illusions or hallucinations (e.g., while fighting the Necromagus, Sabbat, Johnny made Sabbat believe the Grim Reaper was behind him). =Supporting cast= Johnny's original partner is Wulf Sternhammer, who is not a mutant but a normal human from Scandinavia; he became a Strontium Dog out of a sense of camaraderie with Johnny, and, despite the indignities, he viewed it as good work as it kept the galaxy \\"safe for decent people\\".Starlord #1 A blunt and straightforward brawler, Wulf was far less prone to doubt and introspection and tried to bring his friend back in line when he had doubts. Ever since Starlord #5, Wulf wore the fur pelt of a Gronk that he'd befriended - the alien's custom was for people dear to them to wear their skin, so part of them would live on. Wulf acted a lot like a stereotypical Viking and it was eventually retconned that he was a Viking, accidentally brought into the 22nd century when Johnny was pursuing a criminal gang through time. Early strips included the Gronk, the brother of the Gronk that Wulf had met earlier. It was a timid, metal-eating alien from the planet Blas, in the Gallego system (a tribute to the fantasy artist Blas Gallego). The Gronk provided medical back-up and constantly worried about its \\"poor heartses\\", and in \\"Outlaw\\" showed it could survive multiple heart attacks. A gag showed that \\"the Gronk\\" was the name for most of its species, causing problems when mail arrives for \\"the Gronk\\". In the Strontium Dogs spinoff, the Gronk transformed into a gun-toting highly aggressive soldier. King Clarkie the Second, a thinly veiled parody of Prince Charles was the monarch for much of the strip, being deposed late in the series for his pro-mutant views. While presented as a buffoon in several strips, he was also essentially harmless and well-meaning. Two allies who gained their own solo spin-off series were Middenface McNulty, a Scottish mutant raised in a ghetto/concentration camp called 'Shytehill' - presumably a reference to the Sighthill area of Glasgow - and whose head is covered with lumps; and Durham Red, a female agent whose mutation resembles vampirism and who is thus feared and despised by other mutants. Feral, introduced in \\"The Final Solution\\", was a young, savage mutant. He initially despised the Strontium Dogs, who he saw as abandoning the mutants on Earth, but was inspired by the actions of Johnny Alpha. Feral witnessed Alpha's sacrifice in \\"The Final Solution\\", and in the original \\"Strontium Dogs\\" strips of the 1990s, he became first a rebel outlaw in the colony worlds and then a renowned SD Agent. In \\"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\\", this was ignored and he became a SD Agent soon after \\"The Final Solution\\" ‚Äì due to his abrasive personality, he soon left and became an outlaw who tried to resurrect Alpha, only to give up. In this second timeline, he was executed for murder on an alien world. In both the original series and the revival Alpha frequently encountered or worked alongside members of a mutant family known as the Stix Clan. All members male and female are identical in appearance, personality and dress sense. They all hail from a single town called Stixville on the planet Freedonia and are highly hostile to any outsiders. They often appear as antagonist to Alpha but at times have worked alongside him, however they usually double cross and betray him at some point showing only the slightest loyalty to other Stix. There is said to be only one good Stix, Father Phineas who is a Catholic priest, a genuinely good and kind person and thus unmentionable around the rest of the Clan. The revival would introduce Negus, the First Lord of the Military, a stern-faced and middle-aged politician who would both hire Johnny and act as his Upminster contact. Negus was pushing for increased mutant rights, having a mutant daughter that he kept at home (something Johnny remarked as being a brave act for a man in Negus' position), though he still wanted to keep mutant and norm bloodlines separate. Flashbacks to the pre-Wulf days of Johnny's life would introduce Precious Matson, a reporter from the mutant colony of Freedonia. A competent and dogged reporter, she became friends with Johnny and helped him against the terrorist leader Blood Moon. In \\"Life and Death\\", she began investigating the true events of Johnny's death and, with McNulty's aid, was able to resurrect him. In 2018 ‚ÄúThe Son‚Äù revealed that Wulf had had a son, Kenton Sternhammer, who joined the Search/Destroy Agency. =Date= The first Strontium Dog stories in Starlord and 2000 AD were set in the year 2180. Later, the story \\"Max Bubba\\" gave the date 2185 (just as in the Judge Dredd stories by the same writers, the date progresses in real time). However, although the stories \\"The No-Go Job\\" and \\"The Final Solution\\" were said to take place two years after the events in \\"Max Bubba,\\" the date was again given as 2180. This discrepancy was repeated in the story \\"Judgement Day\\" (written by Garth Ennis), which gave the date 2178 even though it was set after the events in \\"Max Bubba.\\" Occasionally, some one-episode stories which appeared in annuals and summer specials were set outside the range of dates given above, being set in different points of Alpha's life. Major stories =Original run= \\"Portrait of a Mutant\\", a flashback story in 1981, filled in the background of the series and Johnny's role in the Mutant Army; it introduced Kreelman and the Kreelers, his quasi-official anti-mutant police. Kreelman drafted laws stating mutants were not allowed to work or own businesses, leading to them being forced from their homes into slums and eventually into being forced into labour camps; the only option for many mutants was to join the nationwide guerilla Mutant Army. An attack was launched on Upminster in 2167 as part of a general uprising, but the Army's leaders were forced to surrender in the face of mass mutant executions. Kreelman used this as an opportunity to push forward the extermination of all mutants; Johnny Alpha and the other leaders escaped (thanks to Johnny's sister and mother) and led the Mutant Army in a second major uprising to prevent genocide. The Prime Minister and King agreed to draft into law a better deal for mutants, and - after hearing Alpha was Kreelman's son from Ruth - blackmailed Kreelman into resigning. The mutant leaders were pardoned on condition they go into exile in space, leading to the creation of the Search/Destroy agency; the Kreelers were disbanded and replaced with a new police force. This changeover was depicted by a panel showing Kreelers, which was then repeated but with a different uniform, showing that the same people and attitudes remained. In the present day, bookending \\"Portrait\\", Johnny tracked his father down and activated a time device, causing his father to relive his final moments: begging for his life, forever. In the story \\"Outlaw\\", Kreelman was later freed, and, in disguise, had himself appointed head of the Search/Destroy agency. He used his position to frame Johnny and other Mutant Army veterans for murder. Johnny was soon made aware of the truth and had no qualms about dragging his own father before the deceived mutants who gunned him down on the spot. In the 1986 story \\"Max Bubba\\", a lengthy story explaining Wulf's origins, Wulf was killed off at the hands of Max Bubba and his gang. This led to the epic \\"Rage\\", in which Johnny remorselessly hunted down his partner's killers. After that Johnny either worked solo, or with Durham Red or Scottish mutant Middenface McNulty. Johnny was killed off in 1990, sacrificing himself to save mutants from extermination at the hands of Kreelman's illegitimate son, Lord Sagan. Artist Carlos Ezquerra disagreed with the decision to kill him and refused to draw it, so Johnny's final adventures were illustrated by Simon Harrison and Colin MacNeil. John Wagner later admitted in Judge Dredd Megazine's Thrill Power Overload feature on the history of the comic that \\"killing off Johnny Alpha was a mistake [that] I'm doing my best to rectify.\\"Judge Dredd Megazine, volume 4, issue 17, p. 49 He later described it as \\"one of the big regrets of my career, probably the biggest.\\"Judge Dredd Megazine #377, 2016. =Post- death and Strontium Dogs= The medium of time travel allowed him to make further appearances. In the 1991 Judge Dredd Annual John Wagner wrote and Colin MacNeil drew \\"Top Dogs\\", in which Johnny and Wulf travel back in time to Mega-City One in pursuit of a criminal, whilst encountering and only narrowly escaping Judge Dredd. Johnny and Dredd renewed acquaintances in 1992 in the Judge Dredd story \\"Judgement Day\\", written by Garth Ennis and drawn mainly by Ezquerra. The supporting cast would gain their own spin-off strip Strontium Dogs in the 1990s, written by Garth Ennis and Peter Hogan. It was criticised by Ennis in the book Thrill Power Overload as being anti-climactic and that the lead, Feral, \\"was nowhere near as interesting as Johnny\\". The series was scrapped when David Bishop became 2000 AD's editor. The first story, Monster starring Feral, revealed the Search Destroy Agency no longer existed and mutants had been driven off Earth by a hastily assembled UK junta government; colony worlds were also shown to be under military occupation and severely ill-treating mutants, with the alleged mutant resistance merely using their organisation to extort \\"liberation\\" taxes from mutants (an allegory for The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Ennis' home). Ennis would bring back the Gronk in Return of the Gronk, turning him into an aggressive berserker: learning that Johnny Alpha was dead caused a heart attack which awakened his aggressive side of this one. The Gronk and Feral were teamed up, and went out for revenge against the necromancers who'd killed Alpha in The Darkest Star. In the process, Feral found out he was the son of the lead necromancer and both he and the Gronk discovered that the necromancers drew their power from torturing the people they had killed ‚Äì including Johnny Alpha. To destroy the enemy, the Gronk killed the captives ‚Äì including, at his friend's request, Alpha himself, who couldn't live on in such excruciating pain. From prog 897, Peter Hogan became the regular writer on the strip and in prog 898 he resurrected the Search Destroy Agency: an agent named Bullmoose revealed that the Galactic Crime Commission had cut ties with Earth (who had pressed for the Agency to be closed and mutants purged), moved to Ganymede, and recreated the agency as they needed mutants to \\"clean their dirty laundry for them\\". Durham Red was given her own solo series, written by Alan Grant, Peter Hogan and later Dan Abnett. This series continued after Strontium Dogs was cancelled. =Revival= In the Prog 2000 holiday special, published at the end of 1999, Johnny Alpha was revived by his original creators, Wagner and Ezquerra. The new stories were set before Johnny's death. The first story, \\"The Kreeler Conspiracy\\", was based on a treatment Wagner had written for an aborted Strontium Dog TV pilot, and featured Johnny working solo, but Wulf returned in subsequent stories. Wagner introduced the concept that all previous stories were 'folklore' and the current series was the truth, giving him free rein to alter a number of details (such as giving Johnny an AI computer assistant and Kreelman having been President of a unified Earth government). This concept was dropped after \\"Conspiracy\\", with the later stories directly harkening back to the original run. A subsequent story in 2004, \\"Traitor To His Kind\\" (progs 1406‚Äì1415), introduced Johnny's half-brother, head of a brutal police unit that dealt with mutant crimes. Hired by pro-mutant First Lord Negus, Johnny was sent to get a kidnapped King Clarkie back from mutant guerillas; loath though he was to do so, he knew elements within the government were trying to use this as an excuse to viciously crack down on mutants. Johnny and Wulf rescue the King, as well as uncovering a conspiracy in the Home Office to allow the kidnapping and subsequently fake the King's murder so as to provide a reason for mutant brutalisation. While this led to an improvement in the lives of mutants, all of it was behind the scenes and Johnny Alpha was branded a traitor by mutants for working against his kind. The 2009 story Blood Moon retconned in a fanatical mutant rebel leader, William Blood Moon, who was responsible for civilian massacres and suicide bombings. Johnny had been seconded to him during the war, and swore vengeance for Moon having his friend Mardi killed as a suicide bomber; years later, before meeting Wulf, he and other former rebel leaders would hunt down Blood Moon to kill him for his continuing terrorist atrocities. Johnny would use a time bomb to take Moon back to the site of Mardi's bombing and executed him there. =The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha= In prog 1689, June 2010, Wagner and Ezquerra began a strip called The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha which took place following The Final Solution. The strip featured reporter Precious Matson trying to discover the true circumstances behind Johnny's death: the story explicitly stated itself to be a retcon and the \\"true\\" story of what happened, and diverged from The Final Solution when Precious revealed to Middenface McNulty that Johnny's body had been brought back by Feral (the original strip showed it destroyed and the remains left behind).2000 AD prog 1689 Mutants remain on Earth, the S/D Agency still exists and has a new Doghouse satellite, and the UK government is said to be \\"apologists and mutie-lovers\\", ignoring Strontium Dogs.Prog 1690 Middenface and Precious went searching for the truth behind Johnny's death and the whereabouts of his body. In the process, they found out that Feral had taken the body on a quest for the Stone Wizards, immensely powerful entities that could bring Johnny back to life ‚Äì but, as the cost would be his own life, he backed out and buried him instead. (Feral would end up executed during the story for unrelated crimes.) Precious and Middenface located the body and took it to the Stone Wizards, where McNulty offered to die so Johnny would live ‚Äì the story ended with Johnny returning to life. The story continued in three further installments from 2011 to 2014. Alpha discovered a conspiracy to secretly sterilise all mutants in New Britain. This revelation led to a new civil war, with Alpha leading the mutant faction. After the conclusion of The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha, the series returned to its bounty-hunter premise. In The Son in 2018 a new character, Wulf Sternhammer's son Kenton, joined Johnny Alpha as a rookie Search/Destroy agent. Hiatus Since the death of artist Carlos Ezquerra in October 2018, the editor of 2000AD, Matt Smith, has said he is yet to decide whether the series should continue without Ezquerra. However he has said that spin off series set around popular supporting characters are in development.2000AD prog 2115, Input section, \\"Strontium Fallout\\" A story starring the Stix Clan was later published in the May 2019 Villains Takeover Special. In 2020 a one- episode story about Johnny Alpha as a child appeared in prog 2183, by Michael Carroll and Nick Brokenshire. Crossover stories Johnny Alpha has also appeared in three Judge Dredd stories, in which he travelled back in time to Dredd's era. The first was Top Dogs, written by John Wagner, which appeared in the Judge Dredd Annual 1991 (published in 1990).

Originally the company was known as E. Remington followed by E. Remington & Son and then E. Remington and Sons. Early years upright Eliphalet Remington II was born in 1793 in the town of Suffield, Connecticut. He was the second child of four surviving children (but the only son) of Eliphalet and Elizabeth (Kilbourn) Remington, whose family origins lay in Yorkshire, England. Eliphalet II followed in his father's footsteps and entered the blacksmith trade at the family's rural forge in Herkimer County, New York. The original family home at Kinne Corners, New York, built about 1810 and known as Remington House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Remington Company co-founder The younger Remington worked with his father in the forge, and at 23 he hand- made a flintlock rifle using a firing mechanism bought from a gunsmith, but constructing the barrel himself. The rifle received such a response that Remington decided to manufacture it in quantity. By 1840, when his three sons began to take a more active role in the family business, he formed the firm of E. Remington and Sons, which he headed until his death in 1861. The company continued to grow and to develop its product and gradually began the manufacture of other sporting goods, such as bicycles. At the present time, the company is known as the Remington Arms Co., Inc.

In 1594, he led an expedition to the West Indies, of which he wrote an account. The illegitimate son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, he inherited the bulk of the Earl's estate in accordance with his father's will, including Kenilworth Castle. In 1603‚Äì1605, he tried unsuccessfully to establish his legitimacy in court. After that he left England forever, finding a new existence in the service of the grand dukes of Tuscany. There, he worked as an engineer and shipbuilder, and designed and published Dell'Arcano del Mare (1645-1646), the first maritime atlas to cover the whole world. He was also a skilled navigator and mathematician. In Italy, he styled himself \\"Earl of Warwick and Leicester\\", as well as \\"Duke of Northumberland\\", a title recognized by Emperor Ferdinand II. Early life Robert Dudley was the son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and his lover Douglas Sheffield, daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. He grew up in the houses of his father and his father's friends, but had leave to see his mother whenever she wished.Adams 2008a; Adams 2008b His mother married Sir Edward Stafford in November 1579, and then left for Paris. Leicester was fond of his son and often made trips to see him.Warner 1899 p. vi; Wilson 1981 p. 246 Dudley was given an excellent education and was enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1587, with the status of filius comitis (\\"Earl's son\\"). There, his mentor was Thomas Chaloner, who also became his close friend.Wilson 1981 p. 246 In 1588, when the Spanish Armada threatened England, the 14-year-old Robert joined his father, who was commanding the army at Tilbury Camp, preparing to resist a Spanish invasion, but on 4 September, the Earl of Leicester died.Warner 1899 p. viii His will gave Dudley a large inheritance, including the castle and estate at Kenilworth, and on the death of his uncle, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk.Wilson 1981 pp. 336‚Äì337 Probable likeness of Robert Dudley, c. 1591National Portrait Gallery Retrieved 2012-06-11 In early 1591, Dudley was contracted to marry Frances Vavasour with the consent of Queen Elizabeth I, who liked Dudley very much but wished him to wait until he was older. Later that year, Vavasour secretly married another man and was banished from court. In turn, the 17-year-old Dudley married Margaret, a sister of Sir Thomas Cavendish, in whose last voyage he had probably invested. Dudley was excluded from court for this secret marriage, but only for a few days. Margaret was given two ships by her father Robert, named the Leicester and the Roebuck. She soon died childless. Expeditions In 1594, Dudley assembled a fleet of ships, including his flagship, the galleon Beare, as well as the Beare's Whelpe, and the pinnaces Earwig and Frisking. He intended to use them to harass the Spaniards in the Atlantic. The Queen did not approve of his plans, because of his inexperience and the value of the ships. She did commission him as a general but insisted that he sail to Guiana, instead. Dudley recruited 275 veteran sailors, including the navigator Abraham Kendal, and the captains Thomas Jobson and Benjamin Wood. Dudley's fleet sailed on 6 November 1594, but a sudden storm separated the ships and drove the vessels back to different ports. Dudley sent word to the captain of the Beare's Whelp to join him in the Canary Islands or Cabo Blanco, and he sailed again. At first, Dudley's trip proved unlucky: the Earwig sank, and most of the vessels he encountered were friendly. Dudley led only one raid in the Gulf of Lagos. In December, the expedition finally managed to capture two Spanish ships at Tenerife. Dudley renamed them Intent and Regard, manned them with his sailors, and put Captain Woods in charge. He sailed to Cabo Blanco, expecting to meet the Beare's Whelpe there, but it did not show up. Dudley's fleet sailed to Trinidad and anchored at Cedros Bay on 31 January 1595. There, he discovered an island that he claimed for the English crown and named Dudleiana. Then he sailed to Paracoa Bay for repairs and made a reconnaissance to San Jose de Oruna, but decided not to attack it. Dudley divided his forces, sending the Intent and Regard to the north. In Trinidad, he recruited a Spanish-speaking Indian who promised to escort an expedition to a gold mine up the Orinoco River. The expedition, led by Captain Jobson, returned after two weeks; as it turned out, their guide had deserted them, and they had struggled back. Dudley returned to Trinidad. On 12 March, Dudley's fleet sailed north, where it finally captured a Spanish merchantman. It then sailed on to Cabo Rojo, in Puerto Rico, waited for suitable prey for some time, and then sailed towards Bermuda. A storm blew the Beare north to near what is now New England before the fleet finally reached the Azores. Low on provisions and working guns, Dudley sailed for home, but he met a Spanish man-of-war on the way. He managed to outmanoeuvre and cripple it in a two-day battle, but decided not to board it. The Beare arrived at St Ives in Cornwall at the end of May 1595, and Dudley heard that Captain Woods had taken three ships. The next year, 1596, Dudley joined Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to serve as commander of the Nonpareil in an expedition against Cadiz. He was later knighted for his conduct in the Capture of Cadiz, although what he did is not recorded. Shortly afterwards he married Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh. In 1597, Dudley sent Captain Wood on a trading voyage to China with the Beare, the Beare's Whelp and the Benjamin, but they never returned. Claiming legitimacy Dudley claimed to have been told in May 1603, by a shadowy adventurer called Thomas Drury, that his parents had been secretly married.Warner 1899 p. xli He began trying to establish his claim to the peerages of Earl of Leicester and Earl of Warwick, as well as to the property of his deceased uncle Ambrose Dudley, including Ambrose's Warwick Castle estates. The case came before the Star Chamber in 1604‚Äì1605 and aroused great public interest. Ninety witnesses appeared for Dudley and 57 for the widowed Countess of Leicester, Lettice Knollys. Dudley persuaded, and perhaps pressured, his mother to support his cause. She declared in writing (she did not attend the trial in person) that Leicester had solemnly contracted to marry her in Cannon Row, Westminster, in 1571, and that they were married at Esher, Surrey, \\"in wintertime\\" in 1573. Yet all of the 10 putative witnesses (\\"besides others\\") to the ceremony were long since dead. Neither could she remember who the \\"minister\\" was, nor the exact date of the marriage.Warner 1899 pp. xl‚Äìxli; Adams 2008b The Star Chamber rejected the evidence and fined several of the witnesses. It was concluded that Sir Robert Dudley had been duped by Drury, who in his turn had sought \\"his own private gains\\".Warner 1899 p. xlvi King James I ratified the judgement, and it was handed down on 10 May 1605. In 1621, an official investigation in Tuscany, Dudley's new country, concluded that Dudley's \\"friends maintain that his father married Lady Sheffield, but they are unable to account for her marriage during his lifetime, an act so injurious to the alleged legitimacy of her son.\\"Adams 2008a In Italy Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria, one of Dudley's Medici patrons Dudley left England in July 1605, by Calais. His lover and cousin Elizabeth Southwell accompanied him, disguised as a page. She was a daughter of Sir Robert Southwell and Lady Elizabeth Howard, who was a granddaughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Dudley's uncle. The couple declared that they had converted to Catholicism. Dudley married Elizabeth Southwell in Lyon in 1606, after they had received a papal dispensation because they were blood relatives, and they first settled in Florence. In English law, this marriage was bigamous as he was still married to Lady Alice (a marriage not recognised by the Pope as it had taken place in the Church of England). He began to use his father's title of Earl of Leicester and his uncle's title of Earl of Warwick. Dudley designed and built warships for the arsenal of Livorno and became a naval advisor to Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medici family. He received an annuity of 2,000 ducats. In 1608, Dudley convinced the Duke to send the privateer galleon Santa Lucia Buonaventura to Guiana and northern Brazil in the only tentative of Italian colonization in the Americas, known as the Thornton expedition.Sanfilippo, Matteo. Gli Italiani in Brasile. Edizioni Sette Citta'. Viterbo, 2008 =Attempts at reconciliation= James I revoked Dudley's travel licence in 1607. When he ordered Dudley to return home to provide for his deserted wife and family, Dudley refused. He was then declared an outlaw, and his estate was confiscated. He continued contacts with the English court through Sir Thomas Chaloner, who was now a chamberlain to Henry, Prince of Wales. He corresponded with the young Prince on the subjects of navigation and shipbuilding, and in 1611 tried to broker a marriage between him and Caterina, daughter of Duke Ferdinand. Meanwhile, Henry Frederick had taken a fancy to Kenilworth Castle, calling it \\"the most noble and magnificent thing in the midland parts of this realm\\". Wanting it, he was willing to buy it from Dudley and agreed in 1611 to pay ¬£14,500, with Dudley to hold the office of constable of the castle for his lifetime. When Henry died in 1612, only ¬£3,000 had been paid, and it is unclear whether Dudley ever received it. The new Prince of Wales, Charles, then took possession of the castle but failed to pay the balance owing. In 1621, he got an Act of Parliament allowing Dudley's wife to sell the estate to him for ¬£4,000. Memorial to Robert Dudley's daughter Katherine Dudley and son-in-law Sir Richard Leveson. In 1618, James I granted the Earldoms of Leicester and Warwick to others (Lord Lisle and Lord Rich). In 1620, Dudley convinced Grand Duchess Maria Magdalena, wife of the new duke Cosimo II, to ask her brother, the Emperor Ferdinand II, to recognize his claim to his grandfather's title of Duke of Northumberland. Dudley succeeded on 9 March 1620, and James I severed all negotiations for conciliation. =Later years= Adelhida Paleotti became Charles Talbot's wife in 1705; granddaughter of Robert Dudley In addition to shipbuilding, Dudley was busy with many projects in Tuscany, including the Livorno's breakwater and harbour fortifications, draining local swamps, and building a palace in the heart of Florence. He also designed new galleys, and he wrote his memoirs of navigation and seamanship between 1610 and 1620. Later, Dudley incorporated his notes into six volumes of Dell'Arcano del Mare (The Secret of the Sea), self-published in 1646‚Äì1647. He also wrote a Maritime Directory as a manual for the Tuscan Navy but it was never published. In 1631, his wife Elizabeth died the day after giving birth to her last child. Several of their 13 children married into the Italian nobility. In 1644, King Charles I created Dudley's second wife Alice Duchess of Dudley for life and recognized Dudley's legitimacy but did not restore his titles and estate. Robert Dudley died on 6 September 1649 outside Florence in Villa Rinieri (now Villa Corsini a Castello). He was buried at San Pancrazio in Florence. A son of Dudley was Carlo Dudley, titular Duke of Northumberland who was the father of Maria Cristina Dudley, the second wife of Marquis Andrea Paleottil they were the parents of Adelhida Paleotti who married Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury; there was no issue of this marriage. Despite the marriages of Dudley descendants, \\"No Dudleys in the line male now remained to carry on the name. After the third generation they became extinct in Italy\\".Life of Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland By John Temple Leader 1895 In 1660, after the Restoration, Lady Alice, Dudley's second wife (regarded in English law as his legitimate widow), petitioned King Charles II to have her title as Duchess of Northumberland recognised; and for her daughters, Lady Katherine Leveson and Lady Anne Holborne, to be given the rank and precedence of a duchess's daughters. However, the King kept the title in the gift of the Crown, and bestowed it instead on his illegitimate son, George Fitzroy. Dudley bequeathed his estate to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His collection of scientific instruments is on display at the Museo Galileo (Galileo Museum, formerly the Institute and Museum of the History of Science) in Florence. Dell'Arcano del Mare: chart of Portugal Dell'Arcano del Mare The most important of Dudley's works was Dell'Arcano del Mare (Secrets of the Sea). It includes a comprehensive treatise on navigation and shipbuilding and it has become renowned as the first atlas of sea charts of the world. Dell'Arcano del Mare consists of six known volumes that illustrate Dudley's knowledge of navigation, shipbuilding and astronomy and it includes 130 original maps, all his own creations and not copied from existing maps, which was unusual for the period. Originally published at Florence in 1645 in Italian, they represent a collection of all contemporary naval knowledge. The atlas also includes a proposal for the construction of a fleet of five rates (sizes) of ships, which Dudley had designed and described. Dell'Arcano del Mare was reprinted in Florence in 1661 without the charts of the first edition. The distinctive character of Dudley's charts was influenced by the Italian baroque engraver Antonio Francesco Lucini. Later mapmakers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it became a unique and rare relic in the history of cartography. Lucini recorded that he had spent 12 years and 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates.

Interview conducted by Catherine Yronwode October 13th and 17th, 1978 The Spirit chronicles the adventures of a masked vigilante who fights crime with the blessing of the city's police commissioner Dolan, an old friend. Despite the Spirit's origin as detective/criminologist Denny Colt, his real identity was rarely referred to after his first appearance, and for all intents and purposes he was simply \\"The Spirit\\". The stories are presented in a wide variety of styles, from straightforward crime drama and noir to lighthearted adventure, from mystery and horror to comedy and love stories, often with hybrid elements that twisted genre and reader expectations. From the 1960s to 1980s, a handful of new Eisner Spirit stories appeared in Harvey Comics and elsewhere, and Warren Publishing and Kitchen Sink Press variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and in color comic books. In the 1990s and 2000s, Kitchen Sink Press and DC Comics also published new Spirit stories by other writers and artists. In 2011, IGN ranked the Spirit 21st in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of all time. Publication history In late 1939, Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold, publisher of the Quality Comics comic-book line, began exploring an expansion into newspaper Sunday supplements, aware that many newspapers felt they had to compete with the suddenly burgeoning new medium of American comic books, as exemplified by the Chicago Tribune Comic Book, premiering two months before \\"The Spirit Section\\". Arnold compiled a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics material. An editor of The Washington Star liked George Brenner's comic-book feature \\"The Clock\\", but not Brenner's art, and was favorably disposed toward a Lou Fine strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine's slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was the work of Eisner, Fine's boss at the Eisner & Iger studio, from which Arnold bought his outsourced comics work. In \\"late '39, just before Christmas time\\", Eisner recalled in 1979,Panels #1 (Summer 1979), \\"Art & Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner\\", pp. 5‚Äì21, quoted in \\"Arnold came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom\\". In a 2004 interview, Eisner elaborated on that meeting: Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright the feature but, \\"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold‚Äî and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership‚Äî Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership.\\" This would include the eventual backup features, \\"Mr. Mystic\\" and \\"Lady Luck.\\" Selling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000,Kitchen, Denis. \\"Annotations to The Dreamer, in Eisner, Will, The Dreamer (W.W. Norton & Company, New York City, 2008), p. 52. Eisner left to create \\"The Spirit Section\\". \\"They gave me an adult audience\\", Eisner said in 1997, \\"and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'\\" The character and the types of stories Eisner would tell, Eisner said in 1978, derived from his desire The character's name, he said in that interview, came from Arnold: \\"When 'Busy' Arnold called, he suggested a kind of ghost or some kind of metaphysical character. He said, 'How about a thing called the Ghost?' and I said, 'Naw, that's not any good,' and he said, 'Well, then, call it the Spirit; there's nothing like that around.' I said, 'Well, I don't know what you mean.,' and he said, 'Well, you can figure that out‚ÄîI just like the words \\"the Spirit.\\"' He was calling from a bar somewhere, I think... [A]nd actually, the more I thought about it the more I realized I didn't care about the name.\\"\\"Will Eisner Interview\\", The Comics Journal #46 (May 1979), p. 37. Interview conducted Oct. 13 and 17, 1978 The Spirit, an initially eight (and later seven) page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features \\"Mr. Mystic\\" and \\"Lady Luck\\" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called \\"The Spirit Section\\") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies.Eisner, The Dreamer, \\"About the Author\\", p. 55 It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952.

Note the innovative use of title design, the mix of color and black-and-white, and the shadowing and texturing that combine for exotic noir effect. Other Spirit stories could be whimsical, gritty, folklorish, sentimental, horrific, or mystical, yet always humanistic. Eisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in late 1941, \\"and then had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off\\" to fight in World War II. In his absence, the newspaper syndicate used ghost writers and artists to continue the strip, including Manly Wade Wellman, William Woolfolk, Jack Cole and Lou Fine.Eisner, Will (2003). Will Eisner's The Spirit Archive, Volume 10, January 7 to June 24 1945 DC Comics. () Eisner's rumpled, masked hero (with his headquarters under the tombstone of his supposedly deceased true identity, Denny Colt) and his gritty, detailed view of big-city life (based on Eisner's Jewish upbringing in New York City) both reflected and anticipated the noir outlook of movies and fiction in the 1940s.Rzepka, Charles J., Lee Horsley (2010). A Companion to Crime Fiction. Wiley. p. 338. . Eisner said in 2001 that he created the strip as a vehicle to explore various genres: \\"When I created The Spirit, I never had any intention of creating a superhero. I never felt The Spirit would dominate the feature. He served as a sort of an identity for the strip. The stories were what I was interested in.\\"Eisner Wide Open, Hogan's Alley #11, 2001 In some episodes, the nominal hero makes a brief, almost incidental appearance while the story focuses on a real-life drama played out in streets, dilapidated tenements, and smoke-filled back rooms. Yet along with violence and pathos, the feature lived on humor, both subtle and overt. He was shot, knocked silly, bruised, often amazed into near immobility and constantly confused by beautiful women.Steranko, Jim (1972). The Steranko History of Comics 2. Supergraphics. pp. 115‚Äì116. The feature ended with the October 5, 1952, edition. As The Comics Journal editor- publisher Gary Groth wrote, \\"By the late '40s, Eisner's participation in the strip had dwindled to a largely supervisory role. ... Eisner hired Jerry Grandenetti and Jim Dixon to occasionally ink his pencils. By 1950, Jules Feiffer was writing most of the strips, and Grandenetti, Dixon, and Al Wenzel were drawing them.\\" Grandenetti, who penciled as a ghost-artist under Eisner's byline, said in 2005 that before the feature's demise, Eisner had \\"tried everything. Had me penciling 'The Spirit'. Later on it was Wally Wood\\", who drew the final installments. Fictional character biography The Spirit, referred to in one newspaper article cited below as \\"the only real middle- class crimefighter\\", was the hero persona of young detective/criminologist Denny Colt.Eisner, Will (2015). Will Eisner's The Spirit: A Celebration of 75 Years DC Comics. () p.9 Presumed killed in the first three pages of the premiere story, Colt later revealed to his friend, Central City Police Commissioner Dolan, that he had in fact gone into suspended animation caused by one of archvillain Dr. Cobra's experiments. When Colt awakened in Wildwood Cemetery, he established a base there (underneath his own tombstone) and, using his new-found anonymity, began a life of fighting crime wearing a simple costume consisting of a blue domino mask, business suit, fedora hat and gloves (plus a white shirt and red necktie). While elements of this basic costume occasionally vary (depending on the Spirit's circumstances and where he is in the world), he is always depicted wearing his blue domino mask and blue leather gloves.Eisner, Will (2015). Will Eisner's The Spirit: A Celebration of 75 Years DC Comics. () The Spirit dispensed justice with the aid of his assistant, Ebony White, funding his adventures with an inheritance from his late father, Denny Colt Snr, and the rewards for capturing villains.Eisner, Will (1989). The Spirit #56 Kitchen Sink Press Inc. () p.6 The Spirit originally was based in New York City, but this was quickly changed to the fictional \\"Central City\\". Not tied to one locale, his adventures took him around the globe and even to the moon. He met eccentrics, kooks, and femme fatales, bringing his own form of justice to all of them. The story changed continually, but certain themes remained constant: the love between the Spirit and Dolan's feisty protofeminist daughter Ellen; the annual \\"Christmas Spirit\\" stories; and the Octopus (a psychopathic criminal mastermind who was never seen, except for his distinctive purple gloves).Eisner, Will (2015).

Eisner was criticized for his depiction of Ebony White, the Spirit's African-American sidekick. The character's name is a racial pun, and his facial features, including large white eyes and thick pinkish lips, are typical of racial blackface caricatures popular throughout the \\"Jim Crow\\" era. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said he tried to do so with \\"responsibility\\", and argued that \\"at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity\\".Eisner interview, The character, who was consistently treated with respect by the strip's fellow cast-members, developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced such African- American characters as the no-nonsense Detective Grey who defied popular stereotypes. Ebony debuted as a resourceful taxi driver in the first \\"Spirit Section\\". He became a mainstay of the strip and a principal member of the Spirit's supporting cast until Eisner phased him out of the narrative in mid-1949 and replaced him with another assistant, a Caucasian boy named Sammy. Ebony's last \\"starring\\" role in a Spirit story (a semi-regular event in which he was the focus of the story rather than the Spirit himself) was \\"Young Dr. Ebony\\", published on May 29, 1949. Sammy first appeared in \\"The Ballgame\\", published July 31, 1949, part of a six-episode arc set in the South Seas, in which Ebony does not appear. Sammy returns to Central City with the Spirit in \\"The Return\\", published August 14, 1949, and is welcomed into the cast by Ebony, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen Dolan. Ebony makes two wordless, one-panel appearances in the next two installments, \\"The Candidate\\" and \\"White Cloud\\" (August 21 and 28, 1949) before making his final appearance in five panels of \\"Lurid Love\\" (September 18, 1949). After this (and apart from one final mention of his name in the text-based splash page of \\"The Inner Voice\\", published November 6, 1949), Ebony left the strip without fanfare or explanation, and Sammy functioned as the Spirit's assistant for the strip's final three years.Eisner, Will (2006). Will Eisner's The Spirit Archives, Volume 19, July 3 to December 25, 1949 DC Comics. () An adult Ebony appears as an office worker in a one-off Spirit story that appeared January 9, 1966, in the New York Herald Tribune. In an accompanying feature article in issue of the New York Herald Tribune, Eisner's former office manager Marilyn Mercer wrote, \\"Ebony never drew criticism from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early Minstrel Show, he himself derived from another literary tradition: he was a combination of Tom Sawyer and Penrod, with a touch of Horatio Alger hero, and color didn't really come into it\\".Mercer, Marilyn, \\"The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter\\", New York (Sunday supplement, New York Herald Tribune), Jan. 9, 1966; reprinted in Alter Ego #48 (May 2005) Other characters *Dr. Cobra is a mad scientist whose chemicals and machinations inadvertently help Denny Colt become the Spirit. *Darling O' Shea is the richest and most spoiled child in the world. *Hazel P.

The first name is a pun on sitz bath. *P'Gell is a femme fatale who perennially tries to seduce the Spirit to a life of crime at her side. She seduces and marries wealthy men who invariably die in mysterious ways, and uses their money to fund her crime empire in Istanbul and expand her influence and control over the underworld. After moving to Central City to find the Spirit, she continues her modus operandi of selected marriages with the cream of society, even gaining an ally in the form of Saree, the young daughter of one of her deceased husbands. In the 2000s DC Comics version, P'Gell was once a young socialite in love with a doctor, working in Third World countries, and turned to a life of crime when he was killed. (Vide Pigalle.) *P.S. Smith (\\"Peppermint Stick\\" Smith AKA Algernon Tidewater) is a silent, baseball helmet-wearing associate of Ebony. Always sucking on a peppermint stick and appearing to be 6-8 years of age, the wordless P.S. is capable of almost-superhuman feats (always played for comedic effect) and serves as Eisner's comic embodiment of anarchy and disruption. P.S. first appeared in The Philadelphia Enquirer as the star of a silent pantomime strip appearing underneath the main Spirit story, before Eisner introduced the character within the main strip (as Algernon Tidewater) in 1941. The character was renamed P.S. in his first postwar appearance in May 1946.Eisner, Will (2008). Comics and Sequential Art: Principles and Practices from the Legendary Cartoonist. W.W.

The initial lines of were first uttered in the story \\"Poole's Toadstool Facial Cream\\" (June 9, 1946). By the end of 1946, all of the lyrics had appeared, sung by various characters. In 1947, Eisner collaborated with his World War II service friend Bill Harr, who composed a melody for Eisner's lyrics. The complete song appears in the April 27, 1947 \\"Spirit Section\\", here titled \\"Ev'ry Li'l Bug\\", with Ebony credited within the storyline as its composer. In the story \\"Wiffenpoof\\" (June 29, 1947), real-life operatic singer Robert Merrill was depicted singing the tune. Shortly afterward, the Robbins Music Corporation of New York published \\"Ev'ry Little Bug\\" as sheet music, with an image of Ebony on its cover page. After three more appearances in the strip, \\"Ev'ry Little Bug\\" remained dormant until 1987, when music producer John Christensen assembled a recording featuring five versions of the tune, released by Kitchen Sink as a picture disc with an exclusive Spirit/Ebony image illustrated by Eisner on one side and the original art for the sheet music on the other. The record featured actor Billy Mumy playing guitar on some tracks. =Song appearances= *June 9, 1946 - \\"Poole's Toadstool Facial Cream\\" *July 7, 1946 - \\"Dulcet Tone\\" *October 13, 1946 - \\"The Heart of Rosie Lee\\" *December 15, 1946 - \\"The Van Gaul Diamonds\\" *December 29, 1946 - \\"Hubert The Duck\\" *February 2, 1947 - \\"The Cosmic Answer\\" *March 16, 1947 - \\"Hoagy the Yogi\\" *April 27, 1947 - \\"Ev'ry Li'l Bug\\" *June 29, 1947 - \\"Wiffenpoof\\" *August 17, 1947 - \\"The Picnic\\" *March 27, 1949 - \\"The Dummy\\" *April 30, 1950 - \\"Wanted, Dangerous Job\\" The Spirit and John Law Several Spirit stories, such as the first appearance of Sand Saref, were retooled from a failed publishing venture featuring an eyepatched, pipe-smoking detective named John Law. Law and his shoeshine-boy sidekick, Nubbin, starred in several adventures planned for a new comics series. These completed adventures were eventually adapted into Spirit stories, with John Law's eyepatch being changed to the Spirit's mask, and Nubbin redrawn as Willum Waif or other Spirit supporting characters. The original John Law stories were restored and published in Will Eisner's John Law: Dead Man Walking (IDW Publishing, 2004), a collection of stories that also features new adventures by writer-artist Gary Chaloner, starring John Law, Nubbin, and other Eisner creations, including Lady Luck and Mr. Mystic. Assistants and collaborators Like most artists working in newspaper comic strips, Eisner after a time employed a studio of assistants who, on any given week's story, might draw or simply ink backgrounds, ink parts of Eisner's main characters (such as clothing or shoes), or as eventually occurred, ghost-draw the strip entirely. Eisner also eventually used ghostwriters, generally in collaboration with him. Jules Feiffer, who began as an art assistant circa 1946 and later became the primary writer through the strip's end in 1952, recalled, \\"When I first worked for Will there was John Spranger, who was his penciler and a wonderful draftsman; better than Will. There was Sam Rosen, the lettering man. Jerry Grandenetti came a little after me and did backgrounds, and Jerry had some architectural background. His drawing was stiff but loosened up after a while, but he drew backgrounds and inked them beautifully. And Abe Kanegson, who was my best friend in the office, was a jack-of-all- trades but mostly did lettering and backgrounds after Jerry left. Abe was a mentor to me.\\"Transcript of March 24, 2010, Feiffer interview at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, published as Eisner's studio also included:Spirit, The (Register and Tribune Syndicate, 1940 Series) at the Grand Comics Database Main page archived from the original on July 4, 2012. *Art assistants: Bob Powell (1940), Dave Berg (backgrounds, 1940‚Äì41), Tex Blaisdell (1940‚Äì41), Fred Kida (1941), Alexander Kostuk a.k.a.

The first of these two 60-page issues opened with a new seven-page retelling of the Spirit's origin by writer-penciler-inker Eisner (with inking assist by Chuck Kramer). Also new was the text feature \\"An Interview With the Spirit\\", credited to Marilyn Mercer; and writer-artist Eisner's two-page featurette \\"Spirit Lab: Invincible Devices\\". Seven 1948‚Äì1949 Spirit stories were reprinted.The second issue opened with a new seven-page story by writer-artist Eisner, \\"Octopus: The Life Story of the King of Crime,\\" giving the heretofore unrevealed origin of the Spirit's nemesis The Octopus, as well as his given name (Zitzbath Zark).

In the mid-2000s, DC Comics began reprinting the feature \\"The Spirit\\" chronologically in the company's hardcover Archive series, in an approximately 8x10-inch format, smaller than the Kitchen Sink and Warren publications. Eisner's final Spirit story appeared in the sixth issue of The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, from Dark Horse Comics, published on April 20, 2005. This 6-page story featured a crossover between the Spirit and the book's lead character, the Escapist. =DC Comics= The DC Comics one-shot Batman/The Spirit (January 2007), by writer Jeph Loeb and artists Darwyn Cooke and J. Bone introduced the Spirit into the DC Universe. The first issue of the ongoing series The Spirit, written and pencilled by Cooke and inked by J. Bone, debuted the following month. The series updated some concepts, with Ellen's Internet skills helping to solve a case, and Ebony White stripped of his racial stereotype characteristics. The team of Mark Evanier and Sergio Aragones became the series' regular writers beginning with issue #14 (March 2008), with Mike Ploog and later Paul Smith providing the artwork. DC'S The Spirit series ran through issue #32 (Aug. 2009), with most running a single 22-page story. The imprint First Wave, launched in January 2010, featured the Spirit, pulp heroes Doc Savage and The Avenger, and DC's Rima the Jungle Girl, the Blackhawks, and a Golden Age incarnation of Batman into a DC \\"pulpverse\\" overseen by writer Brian Azzarello.

In other media =Comic strip= From October 13, 1941 to March 11 1944, there was also a black-and-white daily newspaper comic strip starring the Spirit. These were later reprinted in several collections, including the complete run in DC's The Spirit Archives Volume 25. In early 2017, the Spirit returned to newspaper strips as a guest-star in Dick Tracy by Mike Curtis (script) and Joe Staton (art), continuing the trend of Tracy stories reviving characters from defunct strips. =TV-movie= The character was the subject of a 1987 ABC television movie starring Sam J. Jones as the Spirit, Nana Visitor as Ellen Dolan, and Garry Walberg as Commissioner Dolan. The film served as a pilot for a planned TV series. =Planned animated movie= An animated feature to be directed by Brad Bird was in development in the 1980s. Steven Paul Leiva, animator Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz also were involved, and a presentation trailer was produced. The Spirit's voice was supplied by animator Randy Cook. =Film= The film adaptation The Spirit, written and directed by Frank Miller, was released in theaters by Lionsgate on December 25, 2008. The film stars Gabriel Macht as the Spirit and Samuel L. Jackson as the Octopus. =Radio= Denis Kitchen, the Eisner estate's agent, said in a July 8, 2006 online interview that a radio series had been in development: \\"It was pitched to the estate by a couple of producers, one of whom is very experienced with NPR, so we have been back and forth on how that would work.

Cooperative Linux utilizes the concept of a Cooperative Virtual Machine (CVM). In contrast to traditional virtual machines, the CVM shares resources that already exist in the host OS. In traditional VM hosts, resources are virtualized for every (guest) OS. The CVM gives both OSs complete control of the host machine while the traditional VM sets every guest OS in an unprivileged state to access the real machine.  Overview  Synaptic and nautilus running on Windows The term \\"cooperative\\" is used to describe two entities working in parallel. In effect Cooperative Linux turns the two different operating system kernels into two big coroutines. Each kernel has its own complete CPU context and address space, and each kernel decides when to give control back to its partner. However, while both kernels theoretically have full access to the real hardware, modern PC hardware is not designed to be controlled by two different operating systems at the same time. Therefore, the host kernel is left in control of the real hardware and the guest kernel contains special drivers that communicate with the host and provide various important devices to the guest OS. The host can be any OS kernel that exports basic primitives that allow the Cooperative Linux portable driver to run in CPL0 mode (ring 0) and allocate memory.  History  Dan Aloni originally started the development of Cooperative Linux based on similar work with User-mode Linux. He announced the development on 25 Jan 2004.Dan Aloni announces Cooperative Linux In July 2004 he presented a paper at the Linux Symposium. The source was released under the GNU General Public License. Other developers have since contributed various patches and additions to the software.  Comparisons  Cooperative Linux is significantly different from full x86 virtualization, which generally works by running the guest OS in a less privileged mode than that of the host kernel, and having all resources delegated by the host kernel. In contrast, Cooperative Linux runs a specially modified Linux kernel that is Cooperative in that it takes responsibility for sharing resources with the NT kernel and not instigating race conditions.  Distribution  Most of the changes in the Cooperative Linux patch are on the i386 tree‚Äîthe only supported architecture for Cooperative at the time of this writing. The other changes are mostly additions of virtual drivers: cobd (block device), conet (network), and cocon (console). Most of the changes in the i386 tree involve the initialization and setup code. It is a goal of the Cooperative Linux kernel design to remain as close as possible to the standalone i386 kernel, so all changes are localized and minimized as much as possible. The coLinux package installs a port of the Linux kernel and a virtual network device and can run simultaneously under a version of the Windows operating system such as Windows 2000 or Windows XP. It does not use a virtual machine such as VMware. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Gentoo are especially popular with the coLinux users. Due to the rather unusual structure of the virtual hardware, installing Linux distributions under coLinux is generally difficult. Therefore, users in most cases use either an existing Linux installation on a real partition or a ready made filesystem image distributed by the project. The filesystem images are made by a variety of methods, including taking images of a normal Linux system, finding ways to make installers run with the strange hardware, building up installs by hand using the package manager or simply upgrading existing images using tools like yum and apt. An easier way to get an up-to-date filesystem image is to use QEMU to install Linux and \\"convert\\" the image by stripping off the first 63 512-byte blocks as described in the coLinux wiki. Since coLinux does not have access to native graphics hardware, X Window or X Servers will not run under coLinux directly, but one can install an X Server under Windows, such as Cygwin/X or Xming and use KDE or GNOME and almost any other Linux application and distribution. All of these issues are fixed by using coLinux based distributions such as andLinux, based on Ubuntu, or TopologiLinux, based on Slackware.

It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petersen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman. It revolves around a wealthy family whose seemingly perfect life is threatened when their teenage daughter begins dating an attractive and mysterious young man. The film was largely derided by critics upon its release, but became a sleeper hit in the spring of 1996, grossing $20 million at the U.S. box office. It has since become a cult film, while at the same time launching teen idol status for its two young leads, who were romantically linked at the time of the movie's premiere. Wahlberg was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain. The film's executive producer, Brian Grazer, described it as \\"Fatal Attraction for teens\\" ‚Äì a loose recollection in which Wahlberg and Witherspoon have the Glenn Close and Michael Douglas roles, respectively, while Petersen is in Anne Archer's. Plot 16-year-old Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) lives in the suburbs of Seattle with her father Steven (William Petersen), his new wife Laura (Amy Brenneman), and Laura's son Toby (Christopher Gray). At a bar with her best friend Margo (Alyssa Milano) and friend Gary (Todd Caldecott), Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg), and instantly falls for his good looks and charm. Nicole falls in love with David, but Steven dislikes him, and grows angry with him when he disregards Nicole's curfew and, eventually, takes her virginity. David soon becomes possessive and jealous of Nicole, culminating in attacking Gary when he sees them hugging, beating him up and giving Nicole a black eye. As a result, she breaks up with him, but they get back together when David manipulates her into believing her father assaulted him. David invites Nicole to a party at his friend Logan's (Tracy Fraim) house. At first, she declines but then decides to drive to the party, where she witnesses Margo smoking crack and, apparently, having sex with David. The following day, she confronts him about his infidelity, and also confronts Margo, who insists that David raped her. David then threatens Margo to convince Nicole to take him back. After seeing Nicole with Gary, David follows and kills him. Nicole goes with Laura and Toby to the mall, where David corners her in the women's restroom. Meanwhile, Steven finds his car vandalized with an insulting note left by David. Furious, Steven breaks into the house David shares with Logan and vandalizes it. In retaliation for Steven's vandalism, David decides to break into the Walkers' residence with his four friends: Logan, Hacker (Gary Riley), Knobby (Jed Rees), and Terry (Jason Kristofer). After Margo informs the Walkers of Gary's death, David and his gang behead Kaiser, the family dog, then make multiple attempts to break inside. Steven and Laura barricade the doors, and Laura injures Hacker with a drill, and he is then taken to the hospital by Knobby. Using a flashlight, Nicole sends an SOS to the Walker's private security guard, Larry, who arrives to confront the situation, but is killed by Terry. David, Logan, and Terry take Steven hostage, forcing Laura to surrender. Toby escapes through a window and gets to Laura's car phone. After Terry finds him in the garage, Toby fatally runs Terry over with the SUV. Logan forces himself onto Nicole; Margo intervenes, but is knocked unconscious. David shoots Logan dead for attempting to rape Nicole. After Toby retrieves Larry's keys and releases his parents, Steven rushes at David and the pair get into a furious brawl. David gets ready to execute Steven but Nicole stabs David in the back with a peace pipe (a gift from David himself). Steven then throws David through the bedroom window to his death. Moments later, police and paramedics arrive.

Reception The film holds a 46% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 5.06/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Fear has an appealing young cast, but their efforts aren't enough to consistently distract from an increasingly overblown - and illogical - teen stalker story\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"Fear is hard to resist. On one hand it's a shameless thriller that makes up for the inevitability of its story by consistently being bigger, faster and more appalling than you might expect. On the other hand, it contains enough truth about fathers, teenaged daughters and young lust to distinguish it from most thrillers and ground it in vivid emotion. It is a nightmare fantasy for fathers. Director James Foley and screenwriter Christopher Crowe keep raising the stakes all the way to a finish that's something out of The Straw Dogs. It's a maddening, satisfying, junky, enjoyable picture.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive review, further accrediting the comparisons to Fatal Attraction, writing: \\"Fear is a teen Fatal Attraction, and ‚Äî surprise ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt bad.\\" He did, however, criticise the finale: \\"[Director] James Foley does a fine job evoking the sexual tensions between father, daughter, and rogue suitor, but he has less luck with the (inevitable) garish climax, which is so unconvincingly staged it never even makes it over the top\\". Gene Siskel gave the film a thumbs-down while Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs-up. Siskel called the picture \\"Predictable trash with an 'inspired' title, and with a third act which nosedives into pure mayhem...It's shocking that such a film was made by the same director who gave us At Close Range, After Dark, My Sweet, and Glengary Glen Ross; this one is not worthy of his talent. It should have been titled Who's That Boy.\\" Ebert, however, claimed the movie \\"generates genuine psychological interest, with an effective and suspenseful portrait of a family under siege.\\" Siskel & Ebert @ the Movies: April 21, 1996 Movie historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture 2/4 stars: \\"This passable slasher epic benefits from taut, stylish direction and from decent performances; still, it's awfully derivative -- especially the climactic showdown. Mark Wahlberg is menacing as the lovestruck hood, but he could benefit from diction lessons.\\" Maltin's TV, Movie & Video Guide Critical revaluation of the film has proved more positive than its initial reception, with Carter Burwell's score being especially well-received. One critic has since stated that \\"although dismissed by some reviewers upon its release as a sensationalist, hysterical, formulaic piece, Fear has improved with age\\". The film was placed as No. 19 on Bravo TV's \\"30 Even Scarier Movie Moments\\".

It follows the adventures of Rogue, a \\"Genetic Infantryman\\", a genetically engineered, blue-skinned, super soldier and his three comrades' search for the Traitor General. His comrades are in the form of biochips ‚Äì onto which a GIs entire personality is downloaded at the time of death for later retrieval ‚Äì and are named Gunnar (mounted on Rogue's rifle), Bagman (on his backpack) and Helm (on his helmet). He is genetically engineered to be immune to almost all known toxins, can submerge in strong acid unaffected, and is able to withstand a vacuum in his bare skin. The series was rebooted in 1989 in the story \\"The War Machine,\\" featuring a new version of the character called Friday. This version of the character last appeared in 1996. The original character returned in 1999 and all stories since then have featured the original Rogue. The character has also featured in a number of 2000 AD crossovers. Publication history Gibbons left the strip early on, to be replaced by a succession of artists and writers who have taken the strip in several different directions over the years. Artists to have drawn the character include Brett Ewins, Cam Kennedy and Colin Wilson. This quest continued from 1981 until 1985, when the G.I. had his final confrontation with the traitor general and, after a brief further run set on the Planet Horst, Finley-Day ceased writing the strip. Simon Geller took over, reinventing the character as an intergalactic hitman attempting to end the war by assassinating key figures, but this new direction was dropped in 1989. John Smith wrote a 'flashback' story, \\"Cinnabar\\", set in Rogue's deserter days, before original series artist Dave Gibbons returned to write a much more radical revamp of the character. In \\"The War Machine\\", Gibbons and artist Will Simpson created a different war, set on a different planet, starring a different Genetic Infantryman, this time called Friday. The bio- chips were dropped, and Gibbons concentrated on the politics and economics of war and the sinister nature of the genetic engineering involved. A new ongoing series featuring Friday followed, written by American writer Michael Fleisher. In Fleisher's final story, \\"Scavenger of Souls\\", the bio-chips are reintroduced via an alien 'soul collector'. Fleischer was replaced with Steve White, who made the military aspect of the strip more up-to-date and tried to reconcile the two versions of the character. He also reintroduced Venus Bluegenes (Helm's treacherous girlfriend from an earlier story who gained a more prominent role during the Simon Geller run) who had her own short spin- off run. His run on the character was the 2000 AD debut of artist Henry Flint. The character was rested after White's last story in 1996. In 1997 a related character, blue-skinned ambulance pilot Tor Cyan was introduced in the story Mercy Heights. In 2002 the original Rogue was reintroduced, again in flashback to his days hunting the traitor general, written by Gordon Rennie. Artists have included Staz Johnson, Dylan Teague, Mike Collins, Simon Coleby and PJ Holden. In 2004 Rennie statedGordon Rennie interview , 2000 AD Review, 4 June that he had intended to revamp the character yet again, but had been blocked by 2000 AD editorial. He also hints that any return to the Rogue Trooper universe will concentrate on supporting cast and not include the Rogue character. This can be seen in the new series The 86ers. Plot synopsis The story is initially set on the planet Nu-Earth, where a war of attrition between the Norts and Southers is being fought. There is some similarity to both the American Civil War and to World War I, with the Norts resembling Germany, and the Southers the Allied forces. During the conflict, the use of chemical and biological weapons have poisoned the planet's atmosphere and oceans. As a result, what remains of the population of the planet, including the troops of both sides, live in enclosed domed military bases and habitats. They wear protective suits, helmets and respiration gear when outside their domes. These suits are known as \\"chemsuits\\". Any damage to the helmet or chemsuit is usually fatal to the wearer. In an attempt to bring an end to the stalemate, the Southern High Command have created the GI, or \\"Genetic Infantryman\\". The GI is a soldier genetically engineered to be immune to the poisonous atmosphere of Nu-Earth, and therefore be able to fight without chemsuits. The Southern High Command deploy the entire GI Regiment in a mass spaceborne capsule drop over an area known as \\"The Quartz Zone\\", which resembles one of the Earth's Poles because the surface has an icy, glacier- like nature. The assault was intended to be a surprise attack, but because a traitor within the Southern High Command has passed details of it to the Norts, they are expecting the attack. The Norts employ elite infantry known as the Kashan and Kashar Legions to repulse the assault, and the entire GI Regiment - apart from Rogue - is wiped out. This event is referred to as \\"The Quartz Zone Massacre\\". Rogue, the only surviving G.I., goes AWOL in order to track down the traitor. Along the way he thwarts numerous Nort schemes, discovers and inadvertently destroys the only portion of Nu-Earth not contaminated by chemical weapons, and is betrayed by every female character he encounters. A later storyline ‚Äì \\"MilliCom Memories\\" ‚Äì shows how the GIs progress through their training, and that rather than a name each GI has a letter suffixed by their age. Rogue is \\"R\\", Gunnar \\"G\\", Helm \\"H\\" and Bagman \\"B\\". Two other troopers \\"D\\" and \\"N\\" are referenced in the storyline. During their training each GI is given a nickname - Gunnar is so named because of his marksmanship ability. Millicom Memories showed there were other prototype GIs before the development of Rogue's class, some of which were killed during his training. In a multi-part story titled \\"The Marauders\\", Rogue encounters a group of deserters from both Nort and Southern sides, who operate as scavengers from a hidden base and attack both Nort and Southers in order to obtain food, ammunition and supplies. Unknown to Rogue, the commander of The Marauders is the Traitor General. Due to accident the General was severely burned and is now unrecognisable. The General later reveals himself to Rogue, then captures and tortures him. Rogue eventually escapes, and with the help of one of the Marauders (a Souther pilot known as 'Player'), defeats the Marauders that pursue him. The Traitor General escapes, destroying the Marauder base as he does so. In \\"All Hell on the Dix-I Front\\" a massive Nort assault forces the Southerners to retreat from a vast area of Nu-Earth, similar to the Ardennes assault of World War II. During this, other Elite units of the Nort military are introduced, such as the Sun Legion, a Regiment of solar glider troops, and the Scum Marines, an amphibious assault force. \\"Sister Sledge\\",a pun on the pop group of the same name a military nurse accompanied Rogue during the Dix-I campaign. She is secretly an enemy agent known as a \\"filth columnist\\"a play on fifth columnist and dies in the final episode of the series when Bagman causes her to fall from a boat into the heavily polluted and toxic \\"Scum Sea\\". \\"Fort Neuro\\" introduced a defensive line that has been cut off from both Southers and Norts since the beginning of the war. The Fort has been split into separate sectors by the same clouds, meaning each sector operates independently of each other, without any contact or cohesion. The soldiers within each sector are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder so the French sector ‚Äì known as \\"Franks\\" ‚Äì wear Napoleonic era uniforms, and hold grand balls that were popular in that period. Other sectors display similar erratic behaviour, with the English troops ‚Äì known as \\"Lime- ees\\" ‚Äì dressing as holiday camp redcoats and behaving as though they are on a perpetual holiday, while the \\"Rom\\" garrison fashion themselves as 1950's Teddy Boys - or \\"Romeos\\". Rogue is immune to all known toxins, diseases, and acids with three known exceptions: * A new plant is discovered after permafrost is melted in an arctic zone, which renders him unconscious.Prog 242 * In the flashback story \\"Cinnabar\\" a retrovirus is engineered specifically to target his immune system, making him susceptible to all other Nu-Earth hazards, ultimately forcing him to wear a chem-suit. * On Horst, Rogue is bitten by one of the Dragoid creatures causing him to pass out. As Bagman points out, Rogue was engineered to be resistant to conditions on Nu Earth, not those unique to Horst. However, the toxin quickly wears off, and in fact has a beneficial effect on Rogue. In a lighter moment during the Fort Neuro series, Rogue is shown to have difficulty breathing when in a staff car full of officers from the \\"Rom\\" sector, who in anticipation of a good night out with the neighbouring \\"Scan\\" sector, have applied too much aftershave.Prog 300 The Biochips are infected by a latent malady unknowingly contracted whilst passing through the Neverglades area of Nu Earth. The unnamed condition renders them susceptible to \\"Enzyme E disfunction\\", which causes their newly re-gened bodies to disintegrate, leaving only their bio-chips. Norts Nort insignia Norts are a fictional fascist enemy with Slavic and German-like overtones. They are fighting the Southers. They were mainly responsible for the Quartz Massacre. The Traitor General was briefly allied with them. =History= In a war which broke out on Earth, it is presumed that Germany and Russia formed a large empire stretching from Asia to Central Europe and ended the war by entering into an unstable alliance with the Southers. The ruling political party of the Norts, the Nordland Party, urged their armies to colonise the various planets deep in Souther space, including Nu-Earth. The early Nort colonists lived in the desert and tamed its wild animals. Years later, when it was discovered that the black hole near the planet led to other parts of the Galaxy, the Norts declared war and launched a preemptive attack on Fort Neuropa, starting the \\"Nu-Earth Future war\\". By the time of Rogue Trooper, the atmosphere of Nu-Earth is heavily poisoned by war gases and cannot be breathed except by the Rogue Trooper; all others in the open must wear chemsuits. In the separate 'Friday' continuity, the Norts started off as a trading company and rival to its sister company, the Southers (both owned by the Clavel Corporation, a megacorporation). When their parent company started a war between Humanity in an effort to avoid stagnation, they pitted the two corporations against one another. After several years (during which time, they started the Eugenics Project), they recalled all high-ranking officers back to their corporate HQ. The sole surviving member of the program, Friday, sneaked on board a rocket bound for their corporate HQ and successfully assassinated Mr. Clavel, the founder and CEO of Clavel Corporation and destroying the company AI, Highside. In the process, he re-ignited the war between the two trading companies.  Realpolitik storyline  In the \\"Realpolitik\\" storyline, War Marshal Zell travels to Nu-Earth after hearing of his son's death. He releases Kapitan Arkhan from prison with the intention of capturing and killing his son's killer, the Rogue Trooper. When Arkhan fails the mission, Zell orders Nu-Earth to be captured and sends all available troops there. Eventually, Zell's Inner Circle begin to plot against him, believing he has gone mad due to his son's death. They capture Rogue Trooper and order him to assassinate Zell. Arkhan discovers the plot and executes the chief plotters. Meanwhile, Rogue's contact in the base (who is a Double agent) betrays him, resulting in her death. Arkhan then contacts Rogue and orders him to continue the mission. After Rogue successfully finishes the mission, he is captured, but is soon released by Arkhan after Arkhan is promoted to War Marshal. Before the newly promoted marshal leaves Nu-Earth, he orders the remnants of the plotters to be executed. =Military= Their armed forces include:  Armed forces  Nort troopers of the Kashan Legion, from a Rogue Trooper comic book The Nort military have formed many units and war machines at their disposal including: * Base Commanders * Chem-sisters * Dust Devils * EMP troops * Infantry * Kashan Legions (Nordland's Elite) * Kashar Legions (Nort warriors) * Lazooka troops * Mortar troops * Nagan Legions (Penal troops) * Navy Sergeant * Undercover Poison-Pollution Agents, known to the Southers as Filth Columnists * Sailors * Scum Legions (Formed by Admiral Torpitz and disbanded after the Fort Neuropa Campaign) * Scum Marines (Named after the Scum Sea) * Sergeants * Shotgun troops * Snipers * Space pirates * Sun Legions (Hang glider troops) * Stammel Riders * Vroogmen (Divers) * Snow troopers * Various Genetic Experiments  War machines  * Amoks (large robots) * Bio-wire * Blackmares (Giant tanks) * Decapitators * Dream Weavers (Horrific illusions) * Drill Probes * Foils (carrying missiles) * Hell Cannon * Hellstreaks * Attack Hoppas * Deploy Hoppas * Hov-Peds * Lamprey Assault Ship * Missile Bomber * Naval Atmocrafts * Nort Heavy Support Armour * Nort Tactical Armour * Patrol Boats * Pillboxes * Porcupines (Particle-Accelerated Armour-Piercing Sabot Micro-Rounds) * Ro-Rats (On Horst Only) * Scoutships * Seed Ships (carrying Decapitators) * Submarines * Tailgunner Joes (fire and forget munitions)  Allies  On Horst the Norts had numerous allies: * Drom * Winged bats * Amphibious crabs * Rhino Subspecies  Other  * The Bioware Units * Ghouls (Deserters from both sides who live on what salvage they find) * Medics * Military Intelligence * Military police * The pay-corps * scientists * Stammels, descendants of Earth Camels which can breathe the chemically contaminated air of Nu-Earth, ridden by Nort Desert raiders. * The Office of the Public Truth- A unit that hunts war criminals, as featured in the Jaegir spinoff comic series. * The Office of Genetic Purity- Another internal security unit with a particular focus on hunting those Nort soldiers infected by the Strigoi Curse. Again featured in Jaegir.  Equipment  Their usual chemsuit has a soft hood, often with a low blunt-pointed top, hiding the wearer's face completely except small round or oblong eye-holes, and two large backpack air or oxygen cylinders. Two wide breathing tubes run, one from the top of each cylinder over the shoulders and run into the hood beside his mouth and nose. The design was likely inspired by the old-type open-circuit aqualung. In some episodes this set has an extra smaller cylinder on the back of the two main cylinders, likely imitated from U.S.Army flamethrowers. In at least one comic issue,Rogue Trooper comic, issue 49, publ by Fleetway, ISSN 1044-5609 one page (page 7) shows Nort chemsuit breathing sets drawn with the breathing tubes coming from an (undersized) demand valve midway between the tops of the cylinders; but many other Nort breathing sets in that issue show the usual design, and in a few frames a version with one cylinder. =Norts= Norts include: * General Doenz - The Supreme Commander * War Marshal Zell (Killed and replaced by Arkhan) * The Grand Marshal (on Horst) * Admiral Torpitz - Naval Commander * General Vagner - Army Commander * Morgen - Ex-Nort sniper for the \\"Marauders\\" * Commandant Marvin - Sun Legion Commander * Marshal Mooler - Scum Marine Commander * War Marshal Arkhan - High-ranking Nort Commander * Mr. Brass of Bland & Brass bodylooters. * Sister Sledge - Filth Columnist who worked in Nu-Atlanta and nearly captured Rogue during the Norts' DIX-I offensive. =Norts: Miscellaneous= * The Norts were inspired by the Northerner Unionists from the American Civil War and the Nazis from World War II. * The Norts' protective suits (showing only the eyes) reinforce the \\"Bad Guy\\" delineation. * They often say \\"Stak!\\" when either surprised or dismayed. * They often say \\"Nain\\", as a substitute for the word \\"No\\", this sounds and looks similar to the German spelling of the word \\"Nein\\". * The Nort lightning-bolt insignia bears some similarity to the insignia of the British Union of Fascists under Oswald Mosley. Southers Souther insignia Southers are the \\"good guys\\" fighting the Norts in Rogue Trooper. Their country is called the Souther Confederacy. They receive orders from Milli-com, their military command complex. It was Souther army scientists who developed the G.I.s in an attempt to produce a soldier more suited to the toxic conditions on Nu-Earth. =History= After an unnamed war ended on Earth, the remnants of America and Britain quickly took control of the Americas, Western Europe and parts of Africa to create a new country and proceeded to promote peace and stability on Earth. They then proceeded to colonise other planets, forming the \\"Souther Confederacy\\" and when Nu-Earth was discovered, they built Fort Neuropa as a base of operations. When it was discovered that the black hole near the planet led to other parts of the Galaxy, tensions mounted between both sides. Eventually, the Norts attacked Fort Neuropa so the Southers were forced to retaliate. By the time of Rogue Trooper, Souther Gene-Scientists had created the G.I. Project in a desperate struggle to win the Nu-Earth Future War. In the separate 'Friday' continuity, the Southers started off as a trading company and rival to its sister company, the Norts (both owned by the Clavel Corporation, a Mega Corp). When their parent company started a war between Humanity in an effort to avoid stagnation, they pitted the two corporations against one another. After several years (during which time, they started the Eugenics Project), they recalled all high-ranking officers back to their corporate HQ. When the sole surviving member of their eugenics program, Friday, sneaked on board a rocket bound for their corporate HQ and successfully assassinated Mr. Clavel, the founder and CEO of Clavel Corporation and destroying the company AI, Highside, in the process, he re-ignited the war between the two trading companies. Fort Neuropa Fort Neuropa was a Souther fort in the \\"Fort Neuro\\" story in the Rogue Trooper stories. Completely isolated since the beginning of the war, its garrison developed bizarre customs (as a result of watching old historical movies and neglecting their Robe-Runners) resulting in its inhabitants aping the manners and clothes of various European nations and groups from centuries earlier. When Rogue Trooper arrived at \\"Fort Neuropa\\", he discovered that everyone was suffering \\"Siege Mentality\\". After losing Bagman, Helm and Gunnar to the \\"Fort Neuropans\\", he discovered a plot by the Norts to capture the fort by playing on these neuroses. After foiling an assassination attempt on his life, he recruited the Robe-Runners to help him foil the invasion. Afterwards the neuroses cleared and the garrison were all back to being ordinary Southers. Rogue had to rescue each sector of the fort separately: * Frank sector: Here the garrison had developed a Napoleonic- period French mentality and were trying to talk in French (spelt phonetically, e.g. \\"Kee valla?\\" for \\"Qui va l√†?\\" = \\"Who goes there?\\"). A Nort had played on this by impersonating Napoleon Bonaparte. Rogue, with help from the Robe- Runners stopped this invasion while Gunnar killed the fake emperor. * Lim-Ee sector (Camp Reveille): Here the garrison had developed a holiday camp format. Their self-styled elite, who had taken on a personality similar to stereotypical English hunt parties, quickly wiped out the Norts. * Rom Sector: Here the garrison had developed a disco format hence \\"Rom\\" meant Romeo. Norts were using Dreamweavers and their own women. * Scan Sector: Here \\"Scan\\" stood for \\"Scandinavian\\". The Scan sector was predominantly garrisoned by women, mostly falling into the blonde bombshell stereotype. As a result, they had close links with the Rom sector, and the two garrisons defended their sectors together. Admiral Torpitz then used his Scum Legions to attack all four sectors at once, bringing in their \\"Amoks\\". All the sectors attacked the Nort forces destroying all the Amoks and killing the majority of the Norts which resulted in the rest of the Norts surrendering. During the battle, the resulting explosions and force-fields make a break in the chem-clouds which resulted in sunlight reaching the ground and as a result, the garrison lose their format obsessions. Before Rogue leaves, the Fort Neuropans reward the Robe-Runners with a new redesign and vow to protect Fort Neuropa from the Norts. As a result, the Nort commander in charge, General Vagner went insane from the shock of defeat. =Realpolitik= Shortly afterwards, Fort Neuropa was destroyed. Its remnants reverted to the World War II era with the leaders modelling themselves after Winston Churchill, Josef Stalin, and Harry S. Truman. =Military= Their armed forces include:- Armed forces The Souther military have at their disposal: * 86th Air Support Reconnaissance Squadron * Chem-sisters * GIs * S3 Agents * Troops War machines * Attack Hoppers * Carter Class tanks * Deploy Hoppers * Drop pods * Hover trains * Landing Crafts * Robe-Runners * Space-Attack Crafts * Stomper Rigs * Submarines * The War Golems (Scrapped after initial tests failed) Allies Numerous allies have included: * Anthropomorphic creatures * Insectoids * Reptilian Dragoids Other * The Bioware Units * medics * Military Intelligence * Military police * The pay-corps * scientists * Vid- Vultures (Remote controlled war correspondents) Equipment Their usual chemsuit has a hard helmet, often with a big anti-gas filter like in gasmasks but bigger, on the front of the chest, connected by a wide breathing tube to the bottom of the helmet faceplate. All the wearer's face can be seen from outside. =Famous Southers= Notable Southers that appeared in the Rogue Trooper fictional universe include: * The Traitor General - The Souther responsible for the destruction of the G.I.s * Star Marshal Lamal - Supreme Commander * Colonel Kovert - Military Intelligence * Doctor Friedkin - Physician * Colonel Logan - Commander in charge (G.I.s) * Mr. Bland of Bland & Brass bodylooters. * Various G.I.s have included: ** Rogue ** Friday ** Tor Cyan ** Venus Bluegenes ** Azure ** Major Magnam - A GI Officer whose bio-chip was found in a weapons auction implanted into a GI Officer's side arm. ** Rafaelle Blue =Southers: Miscellaneous= * The Southers were inspired by the Southern Confederates from the American Civil War (including the rebel yell of \\"South Side, yeah!\\") and the Allies from World War II. * Their protective suits (showing their faces) reinforce the \\"Good Guy\\" delineation. * Female G.I.s are known as G.I. Dolls Historical influences Many elements of the Rogue back-story were inspired by World War II, the American Civil War and the Cold War. Norts (Northerner Unionists) fought against generally less- well equipped Southers (Southern Confederates), and several battles were referenced, such as the First Battle of Bull Run, which was retold as the Battle of Mek-Bull Run. The Norts appear totalitarian in nature. While their uniforms have Nazi connotations their dialect and names are mostly quasi- Slavic, as if they represented a futuristic version of the Soviet Bloc, although there is some usage of German names as well, for example General Vagner, Admiral Torpitz. Their conduct and methods of waging war are also more barbaric than those of the comparatively civilised Southers. Although as the series develops the Southers are also shown committing comparably immoral acts as well. \\"Genetic Infantryman\\" is a direct homage to the supposed \\"Government Issue\\" tag that American troops were nicknamed after.

Spin-offs and reboots =The 86ers= The 86ers was created by writer Gordon Rennie and drawn by artists Karl Richardson and PJ Holden. The story stars G.I. pilot Rafella \\"Rafe\\" Blue and her robot Gabe. =Venus Bluegenes= Venus Bluegenes appeared both in Rogue Trooper and in her own eponymous strip, with stories written by authors including Grant Morrison, Steve White and Dan Abnett. =Tor Cyan= Tor Cyan appeared both in Mercy Heights and in his own eponymous strip, in a series written by John Tomlinson. =Jaegir= Jaegir is a recurring series in 2000 AD, focusing on Kapitan-Inspector Atalia Jaegir, who serves in the Nordland State Security Police. Her role is to hunt down escaped war criminals. =Hunted= Gordon Rennie and artist PJ Holden produced Hunted, a nine-part story told from the point of view of the Traitor General, in 2016. It began in 2000AD progs 2001 to 2009. It features a young Atalia Jaegir and a monstrous early specimen of the G.I. project. =IDW Publishing reboot= IDW Publishing's Rogue Trooper #1. On 20 July 2013, American company IDW Publishing announced that after the success of its adaptation of Judge Dredd from 2000 AD it would now champion Rogue Trooper with recoloured old issues as well as completely new stories. \\"Following the success of Judge Dredd, IDW and Rebellion/2000 AD expand their thriving relationship with the addition of Rogue Trooper to their publishing slate! IDW will launch an all-new Rogue Trooper series in 2014, and also offer newly colored re-presentations of past Rogue Trooper comics, too.\\" On 13 November 2013 it was announced that the new series would be written by British fantasy writer Brian Ruckley and drawn by Alberto Ponticelli. Brian Ruckley acquired the position \\"by writing a pitch document that people apparently liked.\\" He described his first challenge as scriptwriter as \\"I can now say from personal experience that writing comics is not straightforward or effortless!\\" The new Rogue Trooper features a re-designed helmet, rifle and backpack which serve as the three main supporting characters in the stories. The first episode was originally set to ship at the end of February 2014, but the first issue was actually released on 5 March 2014. Due to lower-than-expected sales, the decision was made to put the series \\"on hold\\". The final issue of the new Rogue Trooper series was issue 4, published on 21 May 2014. All four issues were collected as a trade paperback and released on 17 September 2014 under the title Rogue Trooper: Last Man Standing. IDW also published Rogue Trooper Classics, a series of recoloured stories from 2000 AD, in order. It was originally intended to consist of 12 issues (with issue 1 being published on 14 May 2014), but like the new Rogue title, it was cut short, with only 8 issues to be produced in total ‚Äì again, a result of lower-than-expected sales. Other media A range of Rogue Trooper material has been produced: =Novels= There are three novels based on Rogue Trooper: * Crucible (Gordon Rennie, October 2004 ) * Blood Relative (James Swallow, March 2005 ) * The Quartz Massacre (Rebecca Levene, March 2006 ) =Boardgames= The Rogue Trooper Boardgame was released in 1987 by Games Workshop. =Video games= A number of Rogue Trooper computer games have been released in 1986 and 1990. An isometric shooter by Piranha Software for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum was released in 1986. The game consists of killing Norts while searching Nu-Earth for 8 vid-tapes containing evidence of the Traitor General's involvement in the Quartz Zone Massacre, where all of the G.I.s except Rogue were slaughtered. On finding all 8 tapes, Rogue has to return to the Souther base of Milli-Com to prove the General's treachery and the extenuating circumstances of his going AWOL. During the game, as well as the vid-tapes, players could also pick up medi-kits to regain health and ammo boxes to feed Gunnar. A platform game incorporating first-person vehicle levels for the Amiga and Atari ST by Krisalis Software came out in 1990. After Rebellion bought 2000 AD they released a Rogue Trooper video game in 2006, with a Wii version out in 2009. In 2009 Rogue Trooper featured a guest role in the game \\"LittleBigPlanet\\" for PS3. It came in the form of content which could be bought in the PlayStation Store. In 2017 Rogue Trooper Redux was released to the current generation PC, PS4, XB1 and Nintendo Switch, developed by Rebellion and TickTock Games.2000 AD #2050, 27 September 2017 =Film= Grant Morrison has said he will be writing a Rogue Trooper screenplay for Sam Worthington's production company Full Clip Production. On 16 July 2018, Duncan Jones revealed that he will direct the movie, without Full Clip Production. In 2018, a not for profit short fan film directed by Adam Kirley, produced by Joby Stephens and starring stuntman Damien Walters is being released. The short will premiere at the International London Sci Fi film festival. In November 2018, Rebellion Developments announced they were setting up a studio for Film and TV series based on 2000 AD characters with Rogue Trooper as one of their projects.

The pilot sets the pressure altitude and air temperature in the top window using the knob; the needle indicates true airspeed in the lower left window. Here the speed is displayed both in knots (kn) and miles per hour (mph). The true airspeed (TAS; also KTAS, for knots true airspeed) of an aircraft is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air mass through which it is flying. The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. Traditionally it is measured using an analogue TAS indicator, but as the Global Positioning System has become available for civilian use, the importance of such analogue instruments has decreased. Since indicated airspeed is a better indicator of power used and lift available, True airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing; for these purposes the Indicated airspeed - IAS or KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) - is used. However, since indicated airspeed only shows true speed through the air at standard sea level pressure and temperature, a TAS meter is necessary for navigation purposes at cruising altitude in less dense air. The IAS meter reads very nearly the TAS at lower altitude and at lower speed. On jet airliners the TAS meter is usually hidden at speeds below . Neither provides for accurate speed over the ground, since surface winds or winds aloft are not taken into account. Performance TAS is the true measure of aircraft performance in cruise, thus it is the speed listed in aircraft specifications, manuals, performance comparisons, pilot reports, and every situation when cruise or endurance performance needs to be measured. It is the speed normally listed on the flight plan, also used in flight planning, before considering the effects of wind. Airspeed sensing errors The airspeed indicator (ASI), driven by ram air into a Pitot tube and still air into a barometric static port, shows what is called indicated airspeed (IAS). The differential pressure is affected by air density. The ratio between the two measurements is temperature-dependent and pressure- dependent, according to the ideal gas law. At sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) and at low speeds where air compressibility is negligible (i.e., assuming a constant air density), IAS corresponds to TAS. When the air density or temperature around the aircraft differs from standard sea level conditions, IAS will no longer correspond to TAS, thus it will no longer reflect aircraft performance. The ASI will indicate less than TAS when the air density decreases due to a change in altitude or air temperature. For this reason, TAS cannot be measured directly. In flight, it can be calculated either by using an E6B flight calculator or its equivalent. For low speeds, the data required are static air temperature, pressure altitude and IAS (or CAS for more precision). Above approximately , the compressibility error rises significantly and TAS must be calculated by the Mach speed. Mach incorporates the above data including the compressibility factor. Modern aircraft instrumentation use an Air Data Computer to perform this calculation in real time and display the TAS reading directly on the Electronic flight instrument system. Since temperature variations are of a smaller influence, the ASI error can be roughly estimated as indicating about 2% less than TAS per of altitude above sea level. For example, an aircraft flying at in the international standard atmosphere with an IAS of , is actually flying at TAS. Use in navigation calculations To maintain a desired ground track while flying in the moving airmass, the pilot of an aircraft must use knowledge of wind speed, wind direction, and true air speed to determine the required heading. See also wind triangle. Calculating true airspeed =Low-speed flight= At low speeds and altitudes, IAS and CAS are close to equivalent airspeed (EAS). TAS can be calculated as a function of EAS and air density:Clancy, L. J., Aerodynamics, Section 3.8. \\\\mathrm{TAS} = \\\\mathrm{EAS}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\rho_0}{\\\\rho}}, where :\\\\mathrm{TAS} is true airspeed, :\\\\mathrm{EAS} is equivalent airspeed, :\\\\rho_0 is the air density at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (15 ¬∞C and 1013.25 hectopascals, corresponding to a density of 1.225 kg/m3), :\\\\rho is the density of the air in which the aircraft is flying. =High-speed flight= TAS can be calculated as a function of Mach number and static air temperature: \\\\mathrm{TAS} ={a_0} M\\\\sqrt{T\\\\over T_0}, where :{a_0} is the speed of sound at standard sea level (), :M is Mach number, :T is static air temperature in kelvins, :T_0 is the temperature at standard sea level (288.15 K). For manual calculation of TAS in knots, where Mach number and static air temperature are known, the expression may be simplified to \\\\mathrm{TAS} = 39M\\\\sqrt{T} (remembering temperature is in kelvins). Combining the above with the expression for Mach number gives an expression for TAS as a function of impact pressure, static pressure and static air temperature (valid for subsonic flow): \\\\mathrm{TAS} = a_0\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{5T}{T_0}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{q_c}{P} + 1\\\\right)^\\\\frac{2}{7} - 1\\\\right]}, where: :q_c is impact pressure, :P is static pressure. Electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) contain an air data computer with inputs of impact pressure, static pressure and total air temperature. In order to compute TAS, the air data computer must convert total air temperature to static air temperature. This is also a function of Mach number: T = \\\\frac{T_\\\\text{t}}{1 + 0.2M^2}, where :T_\\\\text{t} = total air temperature. In simple aircraft, without an air data computer or Machmeter, true airspeed can be calculated as a function of calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density). Some airspeed indicators incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).

Accordingly, Greek-Americans and Greek-Canadians sometimes call it \\"Easter soup\\", \\"Easter Sunday soup\\", or \\"Easter lamb soup\\". In some parts of Greece, most notably Thessaly, it is not served as soup but rather as a fricassee, where it contains only offal and large variety of vegetables, but no onions or rice, as in the soup. Traditional use Magiritsa is eaten to break the fast of the Greek Orthodox Great Lent, the 40 days before Easter. Its role and ingredients result from its association with the roasted lamb traditionally served at the Paschal meal; in its traditional form, magiritsa consists of the offal removed from the lamb before roasting, flavored with seasonings and sauces. Prepared on Holy Saturday along with the next day's lamb, magiritsa is consumed immediately after the midnight Divine Liturgy. Ingredients and preparation While traditional magiritsa includes all the lamb offal available, it is the head and neck of the lamb which provide most of the soup's flavor, and those parts, along with the intestines, heart, and liver, are most commonly used today. After a thorough cleaning, the lamb parts are boiled whole in water for between thirty minutes and two hours, then cut up into smaller pieces, flavored with onions, dill, butter and sometimes vegetables, and left to simmer. Rice is added towards the end of the boiling process, and the stock is thickened with avgolemono. When consumed in the early hours of the Paschal morning after church, magiritsa is sometimes accompanied by salad and cheese, tsoureki sweet bread, and hard-boiled eggs dyed red as a symbol of the risen Christ's blood.

The object that the metaobject pertains to is called the base object. Some information that a metaobject might define includes the base object's type, interface, class, methods, attributes, parse tree, etc. Metaobjects are examples of the computer science concept of reflection, where a system has access (usually at run time) to its own internal structure. Reflection enables a system to essentially rewrite itself on the fly, to alter its own implementation as it executes.  Metaobject protocol  A metaobject protocol (MOP) provides the vocabulary (protocol) to access and manipulate the structure and behaviour of systems of objects. Typical functions of a metaobject protocol include: *Create or delete a new class *Create a new property or method *Cause a class to inherit from a different class (\\"change the class structure\\") *Generate or change the code defining the methods of a class Metaobject protocol is contrary to Bertrand Meyer's open/closed principle, which holds that software object systems should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle effectively draws a distinction between extending an object by adding to it, and modifying an object by redefining it, proposing that the former is a desirable quality (\\"objects should be extensible to meet the requirements of future use cases\\"), while the latter is undesirable (\\"objects should provide a stable interface not subject to summary revision\\"). Metaobject protocol, by contrast, transparently exposes the internal composition of objects and the entire object system in terms of the system itself. In practice, this means that programmers may use objects to redefine themselves, possibly in quite complex ways. Furthermore, metaobject protocol is not merely an interface to an \\"underlying\\" implementation; rather, through metaobject protocol the object system is recursively implemented in terms of a meta-object system, which itself is theoretically implemented in terms of a meta-metaobject system, and so on until an arbitrary base case (a consistent state of the object system) is determined, with the protocol as such being the recursive functional relationship between these implementation levels. Implementing object systems in such a way opens the possibility for radical discretionary redesign, providing deep flexibility but introducing possibly complex or difficult-to- understand metastability issues (for instance, the object system must not destructively update its own metaobject protocol - its internal self- representation - but the potential destructiveness of some updates is non- trivial to predict and may be hard to reason about), depending on the recursive depth to which the desired modifications are propagated.The Art of the Metaobject Protocol, Appendix C ‚Äî Living with Circularity For this reason, metaobject protocol, when present in a language, is usually used sparingly and for specialised purposes such as software that transforms other software or itself in sophisticated ways, for example in reverse engineering. = Runtime and compile time = When compilation is not available at run-time there are additional complications for the implementation of metaobject protocol. For example, it is possible to change the type hierarchy with such a protocol but doing so may cause problems for code compiled with an alternative class model definition. Some environments have found innovative solutions for this, e.g., by handling metaobject issues at compile time. A good example of this is OpenC++. The Semantic Web object-oriented model is more dynamic than most standard object systems, and is consistent with runtime metaobject protocols. For example, in the Semantic Web model classes are expected to change their relations to each other and there is a special inference engine known as a classifier that can validate and analyze evolving class models. = Usage = The first metaobject protocol was in the Smalltalk object-oriented programming language developed at Xerox PARC. The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) came later and was influenced by the Smalltalk protocol as well as by Brian C. Smith's original studies on 3-Lisp as an infinite tower of evaluators. The CLOS model, unlike the Smalltalk model, allows a class to have more than one superclass; this raises additional complexity in issues such as resolving the lineage of the class hierarchy on some object instance. CLOS also allows for dynamic multimethod dispatch, which is handled via generic functions rather than message passing like in Smalltalk's single dispatch. The most influential book describing the semantics and implementation of the metaobject protocol in Common Lisp is The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales et al. Metaobject protocols are also extensively used in software engineering applications. In virtually all commercial CASE, re-engineering, and Integrated Development Environments there is some form of metaobject protocol to represent and manipulate the design artifacts. A metaobject protocol is one way to implement aspect-oriented programming. Many of the early founders of MOPs, including Gregor Kiczales, have since moved on to be the primary advocates for aspect-oriented programming. Kiczales et al. of PARC were hired to design AspectJ for Java, a language which does not possess a native metaobject protocol.

Drawing by Antoine Morel-Fatio. British and Danish ships in line of battle at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801) In naval warfare, the line of battle is a tactic in which a naval fleet of ships forms a line end to end. Its first use is disputed, variously claimed for dates ranging from 1502 to 1652, with line-of-battle tactics in widespread use by 1675. Compared with prior naval tactics, in which two opposing ships closed on one another for individual combat, the line of battle has the advantage that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore, in a given period, the fleet can fire more shots. Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. The other fleet can avoid this by maneuvering in a line itself, with a result typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sail alongside one another or on the opposite tack. A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be called a ship of the line (of battle) or line of battle ship, which was shortened to become the word battleship.\\"battleship\\" The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 4 April 2000. Development A contemporary depiction of the Battle of √ñland between an allied Danish-Dutch fleet under Cornelis Tromp and the Swedish navy. The Swedish ships are arranged in a battle line in the early stages, but they quickly become disorganized and suffer a humiliating defeat. Copper engraving by Romeyn de Hooghe, 1676. The first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is attested from 1500. The Instructions provided in 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, The Art of War at Sea, Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fern√£o de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese \\"fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...\\". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Warfare: The Triumph of the West - Geoffrey Parker, pp. 125-130, Cambridge University Press, 1995. A line-of-battle tactic had been used by the Fourth Portuguese India Armada in the Battle of Calicut, under Vasco da Gama in 1502, near Malabar against a Muslim fleet.Geoffrey Parker, The Military Revolution, p. 94. One of the earliest recorded deliberate use is also documented in the First Battle of Cannanore between the Third Portuguese India Armada under Jo√£o da Nova and the naval forces of Calicut, earlier in the same year.Marinha.pt, 2009, site Cananor - 31 de Dezembro de 1501 a 2 de Janeiro de 1502 . Another early, but different form of this strategy, was used in 1507 by Afonso de Albuquerque at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, in the first conquest of Ormuz. Albuquerque commanded a fleet of six carracks manned by 460 men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20,000 men army on land. Albuquerque made his small fleet (but powerful in its artillery) circle like a carrousel, but in a line end-to-end, and destroyed most of the ships that surrounded his squad. He then proceeded to capture Ormuz. While it is well documented that Maarten Tromp first used it in the Action of 18 September 1639,Prud‚Äôhomme van Reine, R. Schittering en Schandaal. Dubbelbiografie van Maerten en Cornelis Tromp', 2001, p. 417. some have disputed this. One of the first precise written instructions in any language adopting the formation were contained in the English Navy's Fighting Instructions, written by Admiral Robert Blake and published in 1653.Fighting Instructions, 1530-1816 Sir Julian Stafford Corbett, Publications of The Navy Records Society Vol. XXIX. Individual captains on both sides of the First Anglo-Dutch War appear to have experimented with the technique in 1652, possibly including Blake at the Battle of Goodwin Sands. From the mid-16th century the cannon gradually became the most important weapon in naval warfare, replacing boarding actions as the decisive factor in combat. At the same time, the natural tendency in the design of galleons was for longer ships with lower castles, which meant faster, more stable vessels. These newer warships could mount more cannons along the sides of their decks, concentrating their firepower along their broadside. Until the mid-17th century, the tactics of a fleet were often to \\"charge\\" the enemy, firing bow chaser cannon, which did not deploy the broadside to its best effect. These new vessels required new tactics, and \\"since ... almost all the artillery is found upon the sides of a ship of war, hence it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics.\\"Mahan, A.T., The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660‚Äì1783, pp. 115‚Äì116, quoting Chabaud- Arnault The line-of-battle tactic favored very large ships that could sail steadily and maintain their place in the line in the face of heavy fire. The change toward the line of battle also depended on an increased disciplining of society and the demands of powerful centralized government to keep permanent fleets led by a corps of professional officers. These officers were better able to manage and communicate between the ships they commanded than the merchant crews that often comprised large parts of a navy's force. The new type of warfare that developed during the early modern period was marked by a successively stricter organization. Battle formations became standardized, based on mathematically calculated ideal models. The increased power of states at the expense of individual landowners led to increasingly larger armies and navies.Glete (1993), p. 176. Effective use The line of battle was marked by tactical rigidity and often resulted in indecisive engagements. Fleet commanders sometimes met with greater success by altering or abandoning the line of battle outright by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, Battle of Trafalgar), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line while concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. Battle of Texel, Battle of the Saintes), or by trying to \\"double up\\" the enemy's ships (e.g. Battle of Beachy Head). Weaknesses The main problem with the line of battle was that when the fleets are of similar size, naval actions using it were generally indecisive. The French in particular were adept at gunnery and would generally take the leeward position to enable their fleet to retire downwind while continuing to fire chain-shot at long range to bring down masts. Eventually so many vessels in a line would be damaged that they would be forced to retire for repairs while the French took few casualties and very little damage themselves. Doubling If the opposing fleets were of similar size, a portion of the line might be overwhelmed by focused gunfire of the entire enemy line by doubling. Ships breaking through the enemy line would act in concert with others remaining on the original side to simultaneously engage both sides of a portion of the enemy fleet while the broadsides of the remainder of the enemy line were unable to engage. Age of steam For a period in the late 19th century, naval tactics became chaotic as ironclad warships were introduced. One school of thought held that ironclads were effectively invulnerable to gunfire, so ramming became a popular method of attack, such as at the Battle of Lissa and the Battle of the Yalu River. Another held that naval battles would only be decided by an assault on an enemy fleet in port. Ships built according to these doctrines tended to mount a handful of guns which could fire ahead or all-round, rather than broadside. The fleets of these periods tended to use the line of battle less. However, as ramming fell out of fashion, the logic of the line of battle returned; used in the Battle of Tsushima of 1905, the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and finally in the Battle of Surigao Strait in 1944. During World War II the development of aircraft carriers meant that gun engagements were no longer decisive. This meant there was no rationale for using a line-of-battle formation. In modern naval warfare, a battlegroup generally deploys with the highest-value units in the centre, accompanied closely by anti-aircraft escorts, with a number of anti-submarine escorts surrounding the formation at a distance of tens of miles.

In 1963 he played a key role in exposing Harold Challenor, a corrupt police officer who tried to frame him. Biography Donald Rooum was born in Bradford. He registered as a conscientious objector but was pressured by his family into doing two years military service, starting January 1947. A resettlement grant following his discharge allowed him to study commercial design at Bradford Regional Art School from 1949 to 1953.Sansom, Philip \\"Introduction\\" in Wildcat Anarchist Comics by Donald Rooum, London, Freedom Press, pp.2‚Äì12. Rooum's 1952 portrait by Frank Lisle, one of his lecturers of the time, is in Wakefield Gallery. From 1954 to 1966 Rooum worked as a layout artist and typographer in London advertising agencies, then as a lecturer in typographic design at the London College of Printing until 1983. He studied life sciences at the Open University from 1973 to 1979, and was awarded a first class degree in 1980. He was elected Member of the Institute of Biology (incorporated into the Society of Biology in October 2009) and became a chartered biologist in 2004. Rooum lived with Irene Brown from 1954 to 1983 and they had four children: Josephine Anne (born 1956), Penelope Jane (born 1958 died 1960), Mathew Donald (born 1960) and Rebecca Jane (born 1962). =Activism= Rooum said that he first became interested in anarchism in 1944 when he visited Speaker's Corner in London while on a Ministry of Food scheme which used schoolboys to pick hops in Kent. He subscribed to War Commentary, thus beginning a connection with Freedom Press which continued for over sixty years. During that time he was a writer for and an editor of Freedom, the name to which War Commentary reverted after the end of the Second World War.Rooum, Donald \\"Freedom, Freedom Press and Freedom Bookshop\\" in Information for Social Change Number 27, Summer 2008, pp.29‚Äì36 ISSN 1364-694X In 1949, Rooum began to raise his profile in activist circles, participating in the annual anarchist summer school. The working title of Frank Lisle's 1952 portrait was The Anarchist.\\"Portrait of Donald Rooum by Frank Lisle\\". Wakefield Council. Accessed August 2013. Rooum became an outdoor speaker Market Street, Bradford, then at Speaker's Corner. He was a founding member of the Malatesta Club, an anarchist social club and venue that opened in London on May Day 1954. Rooum and Irene Brown worked as volunteers there. In the long-running feud between Vernon Richards and Freedom on the one hand, and Albert Meltzer and Black Flag on the other, Rooum sided with Richards. = Thought = As to his theoretical position as an anarchist, Rooum stated: \\"The most influential source is Max Stirner. I am happy to be called a Stirnerite anarchist, provided 'Stirnerite' means one who agrees with Stirner's general drift, not one who agrees with Stirner's every word.\\"Donald Rooum: Anarchism and Selfishness. In: The Raven. Anarchist Quarterly (London), vol. 1, n. 3 (nov. 1987), pp. 251‚Äì259 (here 259) An Anarchist FAQ reports that \\"From meeting anarchists in Glasgow during the Second World War, long-time anarchist activist and artist Donald Rooum likewise combined Stirner and anarcho-communism.\\".\\"G.6. What are the ideas of Max Stirner\\" in An Anarchist FAQ =Role in the Challenor affair= In 1963 Rooum exposed police corruption during demonstrations against the London visit by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederika. There had been attempts to outlaw the demonstrations and draconian prison sentences were passed on demonstrators. The government was criticized in the press for the severity of the sentences and eventually there were embarrassing climb-downs. Some of the sentences were overturned on appeal and the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, had to offer financial compensation. Rooum proved that an offensive weapon had been planted on him.Driver, Christopher, The Disarmers: A Study in Protest, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1964 On 11 July, he had joined a demonstration against the royal party at Claridge's hotel. He held up a banner reading, \\"Lambrakis RIP\\", referring to a Greek MP and peace activist who had been murdered. According to Rooum's account, the banner was confiscated by a police officer and read by four plain clothes men. Rooum asked, \\"Can I have my banner back?\\" He was approached by one of the officers: \\"This big one with the short- back-and-sides stepped forward. 'Can you have your what back?' \\"'My banner.\\" \\"He smiled at me. 'You're fucking nicked, my old beauty,' he said, and gave me a terrific clout on the ear.\\"Rooum, Donald, \\"I've dislodged a bit of brick\\", Anarchy, No.36, Vol.4. No.2, February 1964 At the police station, the officer, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, \\"took from his pocket a screwed-up newspaper, which he opened with a flourish. Inside was a piece of brick. His smile widened. 'There you are, my old beauty. Carrying an offensive weapon. You can get two years for that.'\\" Rooum was a member of the National Council of Civil Liberties and he had, by good fortune, read some material on forensic science and so gave his clothes to his defence solicitor Stanley Clinton Davis for analysis. No brick dust was found in his pocket and Rooum convinced the magistrate that therefore no brick could have been there at the time of the alleged offence.Link to article on Challenor, mentioning Rooum's role in exposing him James Morton (1993) Bent Coppers pp.118‚Äì9 There followed a public inquiry that criticised the police and led to the imprisonment of three officers.Parliamentary question by Shirley Summerskill to Home Office ministers Report of Enquiry, by Mr A.E.James, QC, 1965 HMSO, Cmnd 2735 Rooum received ¬£500 compensation (¬£9,655 at 2017 value) and other convictions were overturned. Challenor was deemed mentally unfit to plead and was committed to Netherne mental hospital. A subsequent enquiry found that he had probably been suffering from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia for some months before the incident, but the lack of any successful prosecution against him was seen by some as evidence of further establishment corruption.Parliamentary question to Attorney General re Challenor by Arthur Lewis Cartoonist In 1952, Philip Sansom invited Rooum to draw a regular cartoon strip for The Syndicalist and he contributed Scissor Bill. The name derived from an IWW name for a bosses' yes-man. From 1960, his cartoons started appearing in such outlets as She, The Daily Mirror, Private Eye and The Spectator. Rooum has had a long relationship, with interruptions, with Peace News, his first work appearing for them in 1962. Originals of his cartoons for Peace News up to 1971, together with some for The Spectator, are stored at the British Cartoon Archive. In 1974, Sansom invited Rooum to provide a cartoon for a monthly magazine he was working on, Wildcat. Rooum created a character of the same name. Wildcat ceased publication in 1975 but in 1980, when Sansom was again working on Freedom, he persuaded Rooum and the editorial collective to revive the Wildcat comic strip, which featured in every edition until Freedom ceased printing in 2014. In 2016, PM Press of California published Wildcat Anarchist Comics, a collection of Donald Rooum's cartoons coloured by Jayne Clementson, with some autobiographical material, and What is Anarchism 2nd edition, an expanded version of the Freedom Press What is Anarchism 1992. Rooum has drawn the Sprite strip for The Skeptic magazine since 1987. He has illustrated several books, including Don't you believe it! by John Radford. An exhibition of Rooum's work was held at Conway Hall in 2008. Wildcat, a short film by Adam Louis-Jacob (2018) has an animated, coloured Wildcat walking past some of Rooum's black and white strip cartoons for Freedom, drawing attention to the speech balloons.

Cell proliferation leads to an exponential increase in cell number and is therefore a rapid mechanism of tissue growth. Cell proliferation requires both cell growth and cell division to occur at the same time, such that the average size of cells remains constant in the population. Cell division can occur without cell growth, producing many progressively smaller cells (as in cleavage of the zygote, while cell growth can occur without cell division to produce a single larger cell (as in growth of neurons). Thus, cell proliferation is not synonymous with either cell growth or cell division, despite the fact that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Stem cells undergo cell proliferation to produce proliferating \\"transit amplifying\\" daughter cells that later differentiate to construct tissues during normal development and tissue growth, during tissue regeneration after damage, or in cancer. The total number of cells in a population is determined by the rate of cell proliferation minus the rate of cell death. Cell size depends on both cell growth and cell division, with a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell growth leading to production of larger cells and a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell division leading to production of many smaller cells. Cell proliferation typically involves balanced cell growth and cell division rates that maintain a roughly constant cell size in the exponentially proliferating population of cells. Cell proliferation occurs by combining cell growth with regular \\"G1-S-M-G2\\" cell cycles to produce many diploid cell progeny. In single-celled organisms, cell proliferation is largely responsive to the availability of nutrients in the environment (or laboratory growth medium). In multicellular organisms, the process of cell proliferation is tightly controlled by gene regulatory networks encoded in the genome and executed mainly by transcription factors including those regulated by signal transduction pathways elicited by growth factors during cell-cell communication in development. In addition, intake of nutrients in animals can induce circulating hormones of the Insulin/IGF-1 family, which are also considered growth factors, and that function to promote cell proliferation in cells throughout the body that are capable of doing so. Uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to an increased proliferation rate, or a failure of cells to arrest their proliferation at the normal time, is a cause of cancer.

It was intended to serve students in east Texas, where the majority of the black population lived at the time. In 1961 the administration moved the college into Dallas, Texas. In 2006 the president of Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky reached out to Bishop College alumni, proposing to have them \\"adopt\\" his college as an alma mater. He offered scholarships to their descendants, with a chance to have their diploma read \\"Bishop College\\". This was part of an effort to increase minority enrollment at Georgetown. History 1850 plot plan of Bishop College (Wyalucing) The college was founded by the Baptist Home Mission Society in 1881 as the result of a movement to build a college for African- American Baptists. Nathan Bishop, who had been the superintendent of several major school systems in New England, started this effort. Baylor University President Rufus C. Burleson secured a pledge of $25,000 from Judge Bishop to start the college during a meeting of the National Baptist Education Society meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A committee of Baptist ministers from East Texas, where most African Americans then lived, selected a location in Marshall, on land belonging to the Holcomb Plantation, Wyalucing. \\"Wyalucing, Bishop & West Bush Streets, Marshall, Harrison County, TX,\\" Historic American Buildings Survey, Library of Congress, retrieved 22 January 2013 For the college's first several decades, Bishop's faculty and administration were staffed largely by European Americans. The first African American appointed as president was Joseph J. Rhoads, who started in 1929 and served through the Great Depression and World War II.Bishop College: Texas school continues historic push for academic excellence, Ebony, May 1981 During his presidency, Bishop phased out the high school preparatory programs associated with the college, which had operated to help students compensate for failures in public education. He emphasized the college's new two-year ministerial program. During the 1930s and 1940s, the ministerial program was developed as the Lacy Kirk Williams Institute. It moved to Dallas when the college moved in 1961. The Lacy Kirk Williams Institute evolved into a week-long seminar which attracted well-known preachers including Jessie Jackson and Martin Luther King, Sr. in 1975. (source, Lloyd Thompson's dissertation for North Texas University, p 34-35) In 1961, after receiving a grant from the Hoblitzelle Foundation, Bishop moved to a campus in Dallas. It was able to attract more students there. In Dallas, enrollments increased, peaking at almost 2,000 students around 1970. The college closed in 1988 after a financial scandal led to the revocation of its accreditation, and its eligibility to receive funds from charities such as the United Negro College Fund. Purchased in 1990 by Comer S. Cottrell, the campus is now used by Paul Quinn College. In 2006, the president of Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky proposed a plan to Bishop College alumni to make Georgetown their adopted alma mater. Georgetown offers scholarships to children or grandchildren of Bishop alumni or students nominated by Bishop alumni. Upon graduation, these students receive diplomas with the name and insignia of Bishop College. Georgetown president William H. Crouch Jr. hopes the program will help the college reach its goal of increasing minority enrollment to 25% by 2012. Notable alumni Dr. Manuel L.

History TES, formerly known as The Eulenspiegel Society, is the first BDSM organization founded in the United States. It was founded in 1971 in New York City by Pat Bond (he was a music teacher) and Fran Nowve, as an informal association and support group for masochists; sadists joined shortly after in that same year. Bond placed an ad in Screw magazine in December 1970, reading: ‚ÄúMasochist? Happy? Is it curable? Does psychiatry help? Is a satisfactory life-style possible? There‚Äôs women‚Äôs lib, black lib, gay lib, etc. Isn‚Äôt it time we put something together?‚Äù The ad also ran in the East Village Other. Fran Nowve, using the name Terry Kolb, was the first person to answer the ad. She and Bond began The Eulenspiegel Society in 1971, and Nowve came up with its name. In August 1971, The Eulenspiegel Society's members voted to include sadists in the organization. The Eulenspiegel Society originally met in members' homes, and then met in rented space in theaters and churches. The organization was an active part of the 1970s sexual revolution, as well as LGBT activism, including marching in New York City Pride Parades beginning in the early 1970s. The organization also launched Prometheus, a decades-long- running magazine, in the early 1970s, exploring issues important to kinksters, ranging from advice columns and personal ads, to erotica and art, to conversation about the philosophy of consensual kink. The magazine now exists online. In 1992, The Eulenspiegel Society‚Äôs cofounder Pat Bond received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International. In 1996, The Eulenspiegel Society hosted the first large BDSM convention, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. This event was so well attended that the organization took over two large clubs (Hellfire Club and The Vault) as well as a disco which was converted into a club. Over 1,300 people attended. This event inspired other leather organizations to hold annual conventions as well. The Eulenspiegel Society was one of the founding coalition partners of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, which was founded in 1997.https://ncsfreedom.org/who-we-are/the- history-of-the-ncsf/ In 1999, Gary Switch posted to The Eulenspiegel Society's USENET list \\"TES-Friends\\" proposing the term RACK (Risk-aware consensual kink) out of a desire to form a more accurate portrayal of the type of play that many engage in. Noting that nothing is truly 100% safe, not even crossing the street, Switch compared BDSM to the sport of mountain climbing. In both, risk is an essential part of the thrill, and that risk is minimized through study, training, technique, and practice. In 2002, The Eulenspiegel Society formally changed its name to \\"TES\\". In 2011, TES was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame (under the name Eulenspiegel Society). In 2015, Bond and Nowvve (the latter under the name Terry Kolb) were inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame. Organizational activities TES (pronounced \\"Tess,\\") is an entirely volunteer-run nonprofit organization, including an elected board of directors. It \\"promotes sexual liberation for all adults, especially for people who enjoy consensual S/M\\". It regards sexual liberation as a prerequisite for a \\"truly free\\" society and it is particularly concerned about the freedom of sexual minorities such as the BDSM community. TES generally holds two classes each week (over 100 a year) in New York City, both general meetings, and ones hosted by special interest groups, ranging from bondage to a meet-ups for novices interested in alternative sexualities. In 1996, TES hosted the first large BDSM convention, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. This event was so well attended that the organization took over two large clubs (Hellfire Club and The Vault) as well as a disco which was converted into a club. Over 1,300 people attended. This event inspired other leather organizations to hold annual conventions as well. It also hosts frequent social events, including parties. Membership includes discounts at participating stores and clubs. It also supports AIDS prevention education and organizations such as the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, for which TES is a founding coalition partner. Name TES, originally known as \\"The Eulenspiegel Society\\", took its original name from Till Eulenspiegel, a character described as a \\"foolish yet clever lad\\" in medieval German folklore. Until the early 2000s, the organization maintained the name \\"The Eulenspiegel Society\\". It formally changed its name to \\"TES\\" in 2002. The original name, which cofounder Fran Nowve came up with, was inspired by a passage from Austrian psychoanalyst Theodor Reik's Masochism in Modern Man (1941), in which he argues that patients who engage in self-punishing or provocative behavior do so in order to demonstrate their emotional fortitude, induce guilt in others, and achieve a sense of \\"victory through defeat\\". Reik describes Till Eulenspiegel's \\"peculiar\\" behavior‚Äîhe enjoys walking uphill, and feels \\"dejected\\" walking downhill‚Äîand compares it to a \\"paradox reminiscent of masochism\\", because Till Eulenspiegel \\"gladly submits to discomfort, enjoys it, even transforms it into pleasure\\".

Cyclopaedia 1728, Vol 2 The Age of Sail (usually dated as 1571‚Äì1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the early modern period in which international trade and naval warfare were dominated by sailing ships and gunpowder warfare, lasting from the mid-16th to the mid-19th centuries. Definition Like most periodic eras, the definition is inexact but instead serves as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last significant engagement in which oar-propelled galleys played a major role, to the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862, in which the steam-powered ironclad CSS Virginia destroyed the sailing ships USS Cumberland and USS Congress, demonstrating that the advance of steam power had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete. The Suez Canal, in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships and made steamboats faster on the European-Asian sea route. Golden Age of Sail The period between the mid-18th century and the early 19th century, when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the \\"Golden Age of Sail\\".\\"Sailing Ship Rigs\\" . Maritime Museum of the Atlantic During this time, the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak--immediately before steamboats started to take trade away from sail. Decline By 1873, the Age of Sail had definitely ended, with commissioned in 1871. Devastation was the first class of ocean-going battleships that did not carry sails. HMS Devastation Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s and 1930s, even though steamships were also used for such transports and became more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam- powered vessels from the necessity of following trade winds. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as yachting and passenger sail excursion ships.

This obscures clues for a cryptanalyst, and can be used to increase cryptanalytic difficulty in naive cryptographic schemes (however, most modern schemes contain more rigorous defences; see ciphertext indistinguishability). This is of course desirable for those sending messages and wishing them to remain confidential. Padding is another technique for obscuring such clues. The technique is to break the starting plaintext message into two parts and then to invert the order of the parts (similar to circular shift). This puts all endings and beginnings (presumably the location of most boilerplate phrases) \\"somewhere in the middle\\" of the version of the plaintext that is actually encrypted. For some messages, mostly those not in a human language (e.g., images or tabular data), the decrypted version of the plaintext will present problems when reversing the inversion. For messages expressed in ordinary language, there is sufficient redundancy that the inversion can almost always be reversed by a human immediately on inspection. The English phrase suggests that it originally came from an observation about Russian cryptographic practice. However, the technique is generally useful and neither was, nor is, limited to use by Russians.A History of U.S. Communications Security; the David G.

The group comprised singers Cheryl Cole, Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh. The group achieved a string of twenty consecutive top ten singles in the United Kingdom, including four number ones. They also achieved seven certified albums, of which two reached number one. They have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for \\"The Promise\\". The group's musical style is pop, but they had experimented with electropop and dance-pop throughout their career. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim,Girls Aloud Critical Acclaim due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of ¬£30 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as \\"Most Successful Reality TV Group\\" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for \\"Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group\\" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for \\"Most Successful Reality TV Group\\" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone. The group disbanded in March 2013 following the conclusion of the Ten: The Hits Tour. History =2002: Popstars: The Rivals= The group Girls Aloud was formed on 30 November 2002, in front of millions of viewers on ITV's Popstars: The Rivals. The concept of the programme, hosted by Big Brother presenter Davina McCall was to produce a boyband and a girlgroup who would be \\"rivals\\" and compete for the 2002 Christmas number one single. Following the initial success of Hear'Say (winners of the original Popstars show), several thousand applicants attended auditions across the United Kingdom in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. However, two of these were disqualified before the live shows began: Hazel Kaneswaran was found to be too old to participate, while Nicola Ward refused to sign the contract, claiming the pay the group would receive was too low. Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts were chosen as their replacements. During October and November, the finalists took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating week-by- week between the girls and boys). Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. The five girls who made it into the group were Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh, and Sarah Harding; Javine Hylton missed out on a place in the group, despite previous expectations that she would be placed in the line-up. The group was named Girls Aloud and were managed by Louis Walsh until 2005 when Hilary Shaw replaced him. The new group competed with the boys' winning group, One True Voice to have 2002's Christmas number one single. Girls Aloud won the battle with their single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", produced by Brian Higgins and Xenomania. The song spent four consecutive weeks at number one and was certified platinum in March 2003. The song received critical acclaim; Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that \\"it proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture\\". =2002‚Äì2005: Sound of the Underground and What Will the Neighbours Say?= After the success of their first single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", Girls Aloud spent five months recording the follow-up single and their debut album. Sound of the Underground was completed in April 2003 and released the following month. The album entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The second single, \\"No Good Advice\\", was also released in May 2003 to similar success. Girls Aloud's third single, \\"Life Got Cold\\", charted at number three in August 2003. In November 2003, Girls Aloud released a cover version of the Pointer Sisters' 1980s dance hit \\"Jump\\". The single, which charted at number two, accompanied a new edition of Sound of the Underground. After a brief hiatus, Girls Aloud released \\"The Show\\" in June 2004, the first single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, the group's second album. The single entered the charts at number two. The next single, \\"Love Machine\\", also peaked at number two in September 2004. Girls Aloud then recorded a cover of The Pretenders' \\"I'll Stand by You\\" which was released as the official Children in Need charity single. The song was not well received by critics; however, the cover became Girls Aloud's second number one single, holding the position for two weeks. The album What Will the Neighbours Say? was entirely written and produced by Xenomania. Upon its release on 29 November 2004, the album charted just outside of the top five and was quickly certified platinum. The final single from the album, \\"Wake Me Up\\", was released in February 2005. It charted at number four, making it their first to miss the top three. In early 2005, the group was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Pop Act. Following the album's success, Girls Aloud announced their first tour, the What Will the Neighbours Say...?

The follow-up single from the album, \\"Biology\\" was released in November 2005. The song was critically acclaimed; Peter Cashmore of The Guardian labeled it \\"the best pop single of the last decade\\". The release was followed by a cover of Dee C. Lee's \\"See the Day\\", released in the Christmas week of 2005., following this they presented one-off TV Special, Christmas Mania, on ITV, where they sang songs taken from their Christmas album. Girls Aloud won the Heart Award for the single at the O2 Silver Clef Lunch. The group travelled to Australia and New Zealand in February 2006 to release \\"Biology\\" and Chemistry. Despite, a one-week promotional tour, \\"Biology\\" peaked at number twenty-six on the ARIA Singles Chart, failing to break the group in the Australian market. \\"Whole Lotta History\\", the fourth and final single to be taken from Chemistry, was released in March 2006 and charted at number six. In 2005, Girls Aloud filmed a one-off documentary entitled Girls Aloud: Home Truths for ITV2. The success of the show later made way for Off the Record, a six-part fly on the wall documentary series for E4. Girls Aloud then appeared in an episode of Ghosthunting with...

In the same month, Girls Aloud were moved to Fascination Records, a sub-label of Polydor Records. In October 2006, Girls Aloud released their first greatest hits collection, The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits. It debuted at number one on the UK album chart and went on to sell over one million copies. The album was accompanied by the single \\"Something Kinda Ooooh\\".

Billed as \\"Sugababes vs. Girls Aloud\\", the song served as the official single for Comic Relief which became the group's third number one. In May 2007, Girls Aloud embarked on their third tour, The Greatest Hits Tour. =2007‚Äì2009: Tangled Up, Out of Control and hiatus= Girls Aloud released their fourth studio album, Tangled Up, in November 2007. The first single from the album, \\"Sexy! No No No...\\" peaked at number-five on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \\"Call the Shots\\" entered the top three. The third and final single from the album, \\"Can't Speak French\\", continued Girls Aloud's top ten streak. The release of the single coincided with Girls Aloud's second television series, The Passions of Girls Aloud. The show revolved around each member, with the exception of Coyle, achieving aspirations outside of the group. Girls Aloud also received their second BRIT Award nomination in 2008, nominated for the Best British Group award. In May 2008, Girls Aloud embarked on the Tangled Up Tour which consisted of 34 concerts around the United Kingdom. Girls Aloud performing in Glasgow during the Tangled Up Tour (2008) Girls Aloud then recorded two tracks for the soundtrack to the movie, St Trinian's. They also made a cameo appearance in the film as the school band. The soundtrack was released on 10 December 2007, and the video for \\"Theme to St. Trinian's\\" premiered in December 2007. In November 2008, Girls Aloud released their fifth studio album and would be their final studio album Out of Control, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and became their most successful studio album to date, being certified double platinum. The album's lead single, \\"The Promise\\", became the group's fourth number one on the UK Singles Chart. The single also returned the group to the top two on the Irish Singles Chart. \\"The Promise\\" was awarded Best British Single at the 2009 BRIT Awards; the group also performed the song during the ceremony. For the promotion of the album, Girls Aloud appeared in a variety show entitled The Girls Aloud Party which aired on 13 December 2008 on ITV. The second single from Out of Control was \\"The Loving Kind\\", the track was produced by Xenomania. The song peaked at number ten, becoming Girls Aloud's twentieth consecutive top ten single. The final single from the album, \\"Untouchable\\" was released in April 2009. It peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the first single of Girls Aloud to miss the top ten. Girls Aloud embarked on the Out of Control Tour, which ran from April to June 2009. Their label, Fascination Records released a singles boxset collection to coincide with the tour. In February 2009, Girls Aloud signed a new record deal with Fascination that would see the group release another three studio albums. However, in July 2009, Girls Aloud announced that they were taking a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects, but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010 which did not materialize. Two months later, Girls Aloud briefly interrupted the hiatus to do two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium. =2012‚Äì2013: Ten and disbandment = After three years of hiatus, Girls Aloud reunited for the group's 10th anniversary. On 16 November 2012, the group released their new single, \\"Something New\\" which was the official charity single for Children in Need. The single peaked at number-two on the UK Singles Chart. The group released their second greatest hits compilation, Ten on 23 November 2012. The second single taken from Ten, \\"Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me,\\" was released on 17 December 2012. The single failed to chart in the top-forty. A documentary special entitled Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top aired on ITV1 on 15 December 2012. In February 2013, the group embarked on Ten: The Hits Tour. On 20 March 2013, the group performed their final concert at Echo Arena Liverpool. A few hours later, they announced their split on Twitter. Other endeavours Girls Aloud came together with Mattel in 2005 to produce Fashion Fever Barbies. Each member designed the outfit and look of a doll modelled after themselves. In addition to live DVDs of their tours and both of Girls Aloud's television series, the group has also released Girls on Film and Style. Official calendars were also issued annually from 2004 to 2009, the only exception being 2005. Girls Aloud co-wrote an autobiography titled Dreams That Glitter ‚Äì Our Story. The book, named after a lyric in \\"Call the Shots\\", was published in October 2008 through the Transworld imprint Bantam Press. Before the release, OK! magazine bought the rights to preview and serialise the book.OK! magazine . Ok.co.uk (24 September 2008). Retrieved on 5 August 2011. In 2007, Girls Aloud signed a ¬£1.25m one-year deal to endorse hair care brand Sunsilk. The girls filmed a television advertisement and appeared in and magazine advertisements, with each of the five members being the face of a different shampoo. The same year, Girls Aloud also signed a deal with the UK division of Samsung. They endorsed mobile phones and MP3 players, made personal appearances and sang at Samsung events, and contributed to competition prizes, among other activities. The Samsung F210 Purple came with a 1GB memory card featuring Girls Aloud content. Girls Aloud appeared in television advertisements for Nintendo DS the following year. The group signed a deal to front a promotional campaign for a new low-calorie KitKat bar called \\"Senses\\" in March 2008. The chocolate bar manufacturer also sponsored Girls Aloud's Tangled Up Tour. The exact worth of the endorsement is unknown, but a figure of ¬£500,000 each has been suggested. Sales increased 6.8% in the United Kingdom. Beginning in 2009, Girls Aloud teamed with Eylure to release five sets of false eyelashes, each set designed by a different member of the band. A range of festival-themed lashes followed in 2010, while limited edition \\"10th Anniversary\\" lash was released in 2012. Similarly, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, each member designed a charm bracelet for Pandora, available as either a complete bracelet or a \\"starter\\" bracelet. =Philanthropy= All five members of the group have been involved in charity work. Girls Aloud's cover of The Pretenders' \\"I'll Stand by You\\" was released as the official 2004 Children in Need single, with proceeds going to the charity. Nicola Roberts said, \\"Hopefully if our single does well it's a lot of money going to the charity.\\" Their cover Aerosmith and Run DMC's \\"Walk This Way\\", a collaboration with the Sugababes, was the official charity single for Comic Relief in 2007, recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis' request. Kimberley Walsh said, \\"It's a fantastic song and hopefully will raise tons of money for people living in really difficult situations here and in Africa.\\" In March 2009, Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, and various other celebrities climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. The trek raised ¬£3.4 million for the charity. Between 3 February and 23 March 2009, the celebrities involved in the Kilimanjaro trek also raised money for Comic Relief by providing the voice for the BT Speaking Clock. Walsh is also a charity ambassador for Breast Cancer Haven. She helped open a ¬£2.2 million breast cancer centre in 2008 and participated in a \\"heel-a-thon\\" in 2009. In February 2011, Cheryl Cole launched her own charitable foundation named the ‚ÄúCheryl Cole Foundation with The Prince's Trust following a meeting with The Trust‚Äôs President, Charles, Prince of Wales‚Äù. The foundation provides vital funds for The Trust in the North East, helping disadvantaged young people from her own region. Girls Aloud celebrated their 10 years as a group by releasing another Children in Need single, \\"Something New\\", which they performed on the Children in Need TV special on 16 November 2012. Artistry =Musical style= Girls Aloud worked closely with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania throughout their career. Xenomania produced all of Girls Aloud's albums and singles, excluding nine songs from their debut album, Sound of the Underground, the charity single \\"Walk This Way\\" and two songs from Ten. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud's former manager Louis Walsh says, \\"He just makes great songs for radio. They just jump out at you and stay in your brain.\\" In a review of the group's debut single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", The Guardian's Alexis Petridis exclaimed it \\"proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture.\\" In response to Girls Aloud's debut album, Jacqueline Hodges of BBC Music said that \\"Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits.\\" Petridis of The Guardian described What Will the Neighbours Say? as \\"a great album: funny, clever, immediate, richly inventive.\\" He later wrote that Chemistry is \\"a record that dispenses with the tiresome business of verses and instead opts for songs apparently constructed by stitching eight different choruses together.\\" Talia Kraines of BBC Music exclaimed that Girls Aloud \\"have resuscitated [pop music's] corpse by wedding chart-friendly melodies to experimental avant-garde sounds\\". \\"Biology\\" was described as \\"about as far from tired formula as you can possibly get. It sounds like three separate melodies condensed into one.\\" Popjustice referred to the song as \\"pop music which redefines the supposed boundaries of pop music.\\" In a review for 2007's \\"Sexy! No No No...\\", Nick Levine of Digital Spy complimented Xenomania's work on the song: sacrificing \\"conventional song structure in the name of keeping [...] hooks coming thick and fast ‚Äì and quite right too.\\" =Influences= The band members themselves are known to be fans of artists such as Ne-Yo, Oasis, and Michael Jackson. The group's debut album Sound of the Underground takes influence from a number of 1980s genres, such as synthpop, power pop, and new wave, and 1990s styles like big beat, drum and bass, and garage. The album received comparisons to girl groups such as Bananarama, The Bangles, and the Spice Girls. Similarities to Kylie Minogue and Madonna were also noted. A majority of the songs make use of guitars and electronic beats. The rise of indie rock also inspired Brian Higgins to \\"blur the edges between commercial music and so-called 'indie' music.\\" He continued, \\"pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise, through The Strokes and everything else. We were an independent company and we were as indie as the other bands around us. The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand.\\" What Will the Neighbours Say? further explores different subgenres of pop, especially electropop. Synthesizers are more prominent on the album, although the usage of guitar remains prominent in several songs. The backing track to \\"Love Machine\\", composed by Xenomania musicians Tim Powell and Nick Coler, was inspired by The Smiths, while \\"Wake Me Up\\" includes a guitar riff inspired by garage rock. Chemistry takes influences from a wide variety of sources, including \\"everything from French chanson to piano-pounding blues to the clipped R&B; of the Small Faces\\". Rapping in the same vein as artists like Betty Boo and Neneh Cherry is prominent. Yahoo! Music says \\"there's nary a 'formula' in sight. There are as many sudden tonal and tempo switches as the tricksiest Chicago art rock band. And all but one song here gives guitars a starring role.\\" The songs are noticeably less rooted in electronic music, although \\"Swinging London Town\\" is \\"a dark, squiggly synth pop epic a la Pet Shop Boys\\" and \\"It's Magic\\" is composed of \\"little Royksopp-like keyboard riffs\\". Alternatively, Tangled Up features a dancier, more electronic sound, inspired by the success of their 2006 single \\"Something Kinda Ooooh\\". \\"Call the Shots\\", \\"Close to Love\\", and \\"Girl Overboard\\" are all electropop numbers reminiscent of 1980s music. However, \\"Control of the Knife\\" is more inspired by reggae and ska, while \\"Can't Speak French\\" employs \\"jazzy guitar changes\\" and \\"Black Jacks\\" recalls \\"sixties psychedelica\\". Out of Control features a number of songs inspired by 1980s electropop, while also exploring retro styles. \\"The Promise\\" is a 1960s Spector-influenced number, while \\"Rolling Back the Rivers in Time\\" was compared to the works of Burt Bacharach. =Legacy= Girls Aloud's debut single \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and another Xenomania production, Sugababes' \\"Round Round\\", have been called \\"two huge groundbreaking hits\\", credited with reshaping British pop music for the 2000s. The Telegraph placed the song at number 15 on a list of 100 songs that defined the 2000s, while NME included it at number 39. Spinner.com named \\"Sound of the Underground\\" the eighth best British song of the 2000s. In 2009, The Times included 2007's Tangled Up at number 62 on a list of the decade's best pop albums. MSN listed 2005's Chemistry as one of the decade's best albums. Girls Aloud were one of the few pop acts to achieve continued success and longevity throughout the mid-2000s while R&B; and rock music became more popular. In a review for the group's 2008 Tangled Up Tour, David Pollock of The Independent noted that \\"Girls Aloud remain confidently the only pop show in town.\\" The Times stated, \\"Not since Abba and Michael Jackson has pure pop been so unanimously praised.\\" Girls Aloud are also notably one of the few British reality television acts to achieve continued success and longevity. According to The Times, Girls Aloud are the highest-earning UK reality television stars, having amassed a fortune of ¬£25 million by May 2009. The figure was increased to ¬£30 million the following year, following Cheryl's appearance on The X Factor. All five members were included in a 2010 list of Britain's richest stars under 30. Reviews of Girls Aloud's debut album noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. In 2004, David Hooper of BBC Music exclaimed that \\"Girls Aloud are currently British pop royalty [...] in the ultra-fickle world of TV-generated pop, Girls Aloud have real staying power.\\" Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie said, \\"Girls Aloud really shouldn't have made it as far as a second album. [...] There's just one problem ‚Äì the girls have a knack of coming up with utterly infectious pop songs\\". The group has also received praise from the Jonas Brothers, Aggro Santos, Matt Helders, Duff McKagan, Gabriella Cilmi, Noel Gallagher, Neil Tennant, Selena Gomez, and Spice Girls members Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell. Bono referred to himself as a fan of the group, saying: \\"I think Girls Aloud are at the cutting edge of pop music. They are a great band and they deserve to be centre stage.\\" Chris Martin also said that he is a fan of the group, referring to them as \\"the ultimate form of life,\\" while Julie Burchill has stated that Girls Aloud are \\"simply the most perfect pop group since The Monkees.\\" In addition, Girls Aloud have had their music covered by artists as varied as Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, and Coldplay, among others.

They were essentially smaller and hence cheaper versions of the three-decker first rates. Like the first rates, they fought in the line of battle, but unlike the first rates, which were considered too valuable to risk in distant stations, the second rates often served also in major overseas stations as flagships. They had a reputation for poor handling and slow sailing. They were popular as Flagships of admirals commanding the Windward and/or Leeward islands station, which was usually a Rear-admiral of the red. Rating Typically measuring around 2000 tons burthen and carrying a crew of 750, the second-rates by the second half of the 18th century carried 32-pounder guns on the gun deck, with 18-pounders instead of 24-pounders on the middle deck, and 12-pounders on the upper deck (rather than 18- or 24-pounders on first rates), although there were exceptions to this. Both first and second rates carried lighter guns (and, after 1780, carronades) on their forecastles and quarterdecks. =Three-decker v two- decker= The three-decker second-rate was mainly a British type, and was not built by other European navies to any great degree.Gardiner p. 14 As speed is mainly determined by length along the waterline, the three-deck, second-rate was a slow sailer compared to both its two-deck equivalent and the first-rate ships.Gardiner p. 18 Being the same height as a first-rate but shorter meant they handled poorly and had a tendency to sail to leeward; was described by one of her lieutenants as sailing \\"like a haystack\\".Gardiner pp. 14 - 15 Their poor sailing abilities prompted Nelson, at Trafalgar, to order Prince and to approach the enemy at a lesser angle than the remainder of the column, in the hope that having more sail area exposed to the wind, would enable these two ships to keep up. A near disastrous example of the three-decker's maladroitness occurred on 25 December 1796 when, on sighting the enemy, the Channel Fleet attempted a hurried departure from Spithead: Four second-rates collided with each other while another ran aground.Gardiner p. 15 Apart from its unhandiness, in terms of sheer firepower it was matched or even out-gunned by many of the large 80-gun and 74-gun two-deckers used by the French and Spanish navies. The additional height did, however, give the second rate an advantage in close combat with the further advantage of it being able to withstand punishment like a larger ship, but being much cheaper to build and maintain. It was sometimes mistaken by the enemy for a first-rate, which could possibly make enemy commanders reluctant to press an attack. Term The term \\"second-rate\\" has since passed into general usage as an adjective used to mean of suboptimal quality, inferior to something that is \\"first-rate\\".  Bibliography  * Bennett, G.

Manufactured by Tupolev, the Tu-22 entered service with the Soviet military in the 1960s. The last examples were retired during the early 2000s. Produced in comparatively small numbers, the aircraft was a disappointment, lacking the intercontinental range that had been expected. Later in their service life, Tu-22s were used as launch platforms for the Soviet Kh-22 standoff missile, and as reconnaissance aircraft. Tu-22s were sold to other nations, including Libya and Iraq. The Tu-22 was one of the few Soviet bombers to see combat; Libyan Tu-22s were used against Tanzania and Chad, and Iraqi Tu-22s were used during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Development The Tu-22 was intended originally as a supersonic replacement for the Tupolev Tu-16 bomber. Preliminary design of an aircraft to meet this requirement, designated Samolyot 105 by Tupolev, was started in 1954, with the first prototype completed in December 1957. It made its maiden flight from Zhukovsky on 21 June 1958, flown by test pilot Yuri Alasheev. The availability of more powerful engines, and the TsAGI rediscovery of the Area rule for minimizing transonic aerodynamic drag, resulted in the construction of a revised prototype, the 105A. This first flew on 7 September 1959. The first serial- production Tu-22B bomber, built by Factory No. 22 at Kazan, flew on 22 September 1960, and the type was presented to the public in the Tushino Aviation Day parade on 9 July 1961, with a flypast of 10 aircraft. It initially received the NATO reporting name 'Bullshot', which was deemed to be inappropriate, then 'Beauty', which was deemed to be too complimentary, and finally the 'Blinder'. Soviet crews called it \\"shilo\\" (awl) because of its shape. Tu-22 Blinder landing The Tu-22 entered service in 1962, but it experienced considerable problems, resulting in widespread unserviceability and several crashes. Amongst its many faults was a tendency for skin aerodynamic heating at supersonic speed, distorting the control rods and causing poor handling. The landing speed was 100 km/h (62 mph) greater than previous bombers and the Tu-22 had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail on landing, though this problem was eventually resolved with the addition of electronic stabilization aids. Even after some of its problems had been resolved, the 'Blinder' was never easy to fly, and it was maintenance- intensive. Among its unpleasant characteristics was a wing design that allowed aileron reversal at high deflections. When the stick had been neutralized following such an event, the deformation of the wing did not necessarily disappear but could persist and result in an almost uncontrollable aircraft. Pilots for the first Tu-22 squadrons were selected from the ranks of \\"First Class\\" Tu-16 pilots, which made transition into the new aircraft difficult, as the Tu-16 had a co-pilot, and many of the \\"elite\\" Tu-16 pilots selected had become accustomed to allowing their co-pilots to handle all the flight operations of the Tu-16 except for take-off and landings. As a consequence, Tu-16 pilots transitioning to the single-pilot Tu-22 suddenly found themselves having to perform all the piloting tasks, and in a much more complicated cockpit. Many, if not most of these pilots were unable to complete their training for this reason. Eventually, pilots were selected from the ranks of the Su-17 \\"Fitter\\" crews, and these pilots made the transition with less difficulty. By the time the Tu-22B (Blinder-A) entered service, it was already obvious that its operational usefulness was limited. Despite its speed, it was inferior to the Tu-16 with respect to combat radius, weapon load, and serviceability. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev believed that ballistic missiles were the way of the future, and bombers like the Tu-22 were in danger of cancellation. As a result, only 15 (some sources say 20) Tu-22Bs were built. Soviet engineer checks the 23-mm R-23 cannon in remotely controlled tail turret A combat-capable aerial reconnaissance version, the Tu-22R ('Blinder-C'), was developed along with the bomber, entering service in 1962. The Tu-22R could be fitted with an aerial refueling probe that was subsequently fitted to most Tu-22s, expanding their radius of operation. 127 Tu-22Rs were built, 62 of which went to the AVMF for maritime patrol use. Some of these aircraft were stripped of their camera and sensor packs and sold for export as Tu-22Bs, although in other respects they apparently remained more comparable to the Tu-22R than to the early-production Tu-22Bs. A trainer version of the 'Blinder,' the Tu-22U ('Blinder-D'), was fielded at the same time; it had a raised cockpit for an instructor pilot. The Tu-22U had no tail guns, and was not combat-capable. Forty six were produced. To try to salvage some offensive combat role for the Tu-22 in the face of official hostility, the Tu-22 was developed as a missile carrier, the Tu-22K ('Blinder-B'), with the ability to carry a single Kh-22 (AS-4 'Kitchen') stand-off missile in a modified weapons bay. The Tu-22K was deployed both by DA (Long Range Aviation), and AVMF (Soviet Naval Aviation). The last Tu-22 subtype was the Tu-22P ('Blinder-E') electronic warfare version, initially used for ELINT electronic intelligence gathering. Some were converted to serve as stand-off ECM jammers to support Tu-22K missile carriers. One squadron was usually allocated to each Tu-22 regiment. The Tu-22 was upgraded in service with more powerful engines, in-flight refueling (for those aircraft that did not initially have it), and better electronics. The -D suffix (for Dalni, long- range) denotes aircraft fitted for aerial refueling. Tu-22s were exported to Iraq and Libya during the 1970s. An Egyptian request was refused as a result of Soviet objections to the Yom Kippur War. Design The Tu-22 has a low- middle mounted wing swept at an angle of 55¬∞. The two large turbojet engines, originally 159 kN (35,273 lbf) Dobrynin VD-7M, later 162 kN (36,375 lbf) Kolesov RD-7M2, are mounted atop the rear fuselage on either side of the large vertical stabilizer, with a low mounted tailplane. Continuing a Tupolev OKB design feature, the main landing gear are mounted in pods at the trailing edge of each wing. The highly swept wings gave little drag at transonic speeds, but resulted in very high landing speeds and a long take-off run. A parked Tupolev Tu-22. The Tu-22's cockpit placed the pilot forward, offset slightly to the left, with the weapons officer behind and the navigator below, within the fuselage, sitting on downwards-firing ejector seats. The cockpit design had poor visibility compared to some bombers (doing nothing for the Tu-22's poor runway performance), uncomfortable seats, and poor locations for instruments and switches. The Tu-22's defensive armament, operated by the weapons officer, consisted of a tail turret beneath the engine pods, containing a single 23mm R-23 gun. The turret was directed by a small PRS-3A 'Argon' gun-laying radar to compensate for the weapons officer's lack of rear visibility. The bomber's main weapon load was carried in a fuselage bomb bay between the wings, capable of carrying a variety of free-fall weapons: up to 24 FAB-500 general-purpose bombs, one FAB-9000 bomb (9,000 kg/20,000 lb), or various nuclear bombs. On the Tu-22K, the bay was reconfigured to carry one Raduga Kh-22 (AS-4 'Kitchen') missile semi-recessed beneath the fuselage. The enormous weapon was big enough to have a substantial effect on handling and performance, and was also a safety hazard. The early Tu-22B had an optical bombing system (which was retained by the Tu-22R), with a Rubin-1A nav/attack radar. The Tu-22K had the Leninets PN (NATO reporting name 'Down Beat') to guide the Kh-22 missile. The Tu-22R could carry a camera array or an APP-22 jammer pack in the bomb bay as an alternative to bombs. Some Tu-22Rs were fitted with the Kub ELINT system, and later with an under-fuselage pallet for M-202 Shompol side looking airborne radar, as well as cameras and an infrared line-scanner. A small number of Tu-22Ks were modified to Tu-22KP or Tu-22KPD configuration with Kurs-N SIGINT equipment to detect enemy radar systems and provide compatibility with the Kh-22P anti-radiation missile. Operational history =Libya= The Libyan Arab Republic Air Force (LARAF) used the Tu-22 in combat against Tanzania in 1979 as part of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War to help its Ugandan allies, with a single Tu-22 flying a completely unsuccessful bombing mission against Mwanza on 29 March 1979. A U.S. Navy F-4N intercepts Tu-22s being delivered to Libya in 1977. The Libyan aircraft were also used against Chad as part of the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, with strikes into western Sudan and Chad. Libyan Tu-22s flew their first mission over Chad on 9 October 1980 against Hiss√®ne Habr√©'s forces near the Chadian capital of N'Djamena. Occasional bombing raids by small numbers of Tu-22s against targets in Chad and Sudan, including a raid on Omdurman in September 1981, which killed three civilians and injured 20 others, continued to be performed until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1981. Fighting restarted in July 1983, with Libyan air power, including its Tu-22s, being used in attacks against forces loyal to Habr√©, before a further ceasefire stopped the fighting until Libyan-assisted forces began a fresh offensive in early 1986. On 17 February 1986, in retaliation for the French Operation √âpervier (which had hit the runway of the Libyan Ouadi Doum Airbase one day earlier), a single LARAF Tu-22B attacked the airfield at N'Djamena. Staying under French radar coverage by flying low over the desert for more than 1,127 km (700 mi), it accelerated to over Mach 1, climbed to 5,030 m (16,503 ft) and dropped three heavy bombs. Despite the considerable speed and height, the attack was extremely precise: two bombs hit the runway, one demolished the taxiway, and the airfield remained closed for several hours as a consequence. The bomber ran into technical problems on its return journey. U.S. early warning reconnaissance planes based in Sudan monitored distress calls sent by the pilot of the Tu-22 that probably crashed before reaching its base at Aouzou (maybe hit by twin-tubes that fired in N'Djamena airport). On 19 February, another LARAF Tu-22 attempted to bomb N'Djamena once again. The Tu-22 was intercepted by a patrol of French Air Force Mirage F1Cs, and shot down 110 kilometers off Chad's capital city. One bomber was shot down by captured 2K12 Kub (SA-6) surface-to-air missiles during a bombing attack on an abandoned Libyan base at Aouzou on 8 August 1987. One eyewitness report suggests that the pilot ejected but his parachute was seen on fire. Another Blinder was lost on the morning of 7 September 1987, when two Tu-22Bs conducted a strike against N'Djamena. A French battery of MIM-23 Hawk SAMs of the 402nd Air Defence Regiment shot down one of the bombers, killing the East German crew. This raid was the last involvement of the Tupolev Tu-22 with the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. The last flight of a Libyan Blinder was recorded on 7 September 1992. They are probably now unserviceable because of a lack of spare parts, although seven are visible at the Al Jufra Air Base at the following coordinates: . They were reportedly replaced by Su-24s. =Iraq= Iraq used its Tu-22s in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War from 1980 to 1988. Offensive operations started on the first day of the war, when a Tu-22 based at H-3 Air Base struck an Iranian fuel depot at Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, which in conjunction with other Iraqi attacks resulted in a shortage of aviation fuel for the Iranians in the early period of the war. Otherwise, these early attacks were relatively ineffective, with many raids being aborted owing to Iranian air defences and operations being disrupted by heavy Iranian air strikes against Iraqi airfields. Iran claimed three Tu-22s shot down during October 1980; one on 6 October over Tehran, and two on 29 October, one near Najafabad by an AIM-54 Phoenix missile launched by an F-14 interceptor and one over Qom. Iraq deployed its Tu-22s during the War of the Cities (along with Tu-16s, Su-22s and MiG-25s), flying air-raids against Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, with these attacks supplemented by Iraqi Scud and Al Hussein missiles. Iran retaliated against Iraqi cities with its own Scuds. The Iraqi Air Force were particularly enthusiastic users of the gargantuan FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) general-purpose bomb, which skilled Tu-22 pilots could deploy with impressive accuracy, utilizing supersonic toss bombing techniques at stand-off distances and allowing the aircraft to escape retaliatory anti-aircraft fire. Usage of the FAB-9000 was so heavy that the Iraqis ran low of imported Soviet stocks and resorted to manufacturing their own version, called the Nassir-9. Iraqi Tu-22s were also deployed in the last stages of the \\"Tanker War\\". On 19 March 1988, four Tu-22s together with six Mirage F.1s carried out a raid against Iranian oil tankers near Kharg Island. The Tu-22s sank one supertanker and set another on fire, while Exocet missiles from the Mirages damaged another tanker. A second strike against Kharg Island later that day was less successful, encountering alerted Iranian defences, with two Tu-22s being shot down. These were the final operations carried out by Iraq's Tu-22s during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war. Iraq lost seven Tu-22s during the war, with several more badly damaged. The remaining Iraqi Tu-22s were destroyed by American air attacks during the 1991 Gulf War. =Soviet Union= The only Soviet combat use of the Tu-22 occurred in 1988, during the Soviet withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan. Tu-22P Blinder-E electronic jammers were given the task of covering the withdrawal route back to the Soviet Union. Radar-jamming Tu-22PD aircraft covered Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers operating out of the Mary-2 airfield in the Turkmen SSR on missions in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. They protected the strike aircraft against Pakistani F-16 air defence activity and suppressed radar systems which could aid Pakistani F-16 attacks on the Soviet bombers in the border region. Tu-22PD crews were also tasked with photo-reconnaissance missions, to assess bomb- damage, in addition to their primary electronic warfare missions. The Tu-22 was gradually phased out of Soviet service in favor of the more-capable Tupolev Tu-22M. At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union there were 154 remaining in service, but none are now believed to be used. The Tu-22M was still in use as of 2017. Variants A total of 311 Tu-22s of all variants were produced, the last in 1969. Production numbers were following: 15 of bomber version (B), about 127 of reconnaissance versions (R, RD, RK, RDK and RDM), 47 of ELINT versions (P and PD), 76 of missile carriers (K, KD, KP and KPD) and 46 of training versions (U and UD).

Their productions are staged at Papermill Theatre, at historic Todmorden Mills on Pottery Road in East York, Toronto. Original productions =H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation= H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation is a Star Trek adaptation of two famous Gilbert and Sullivan operettas (HMS Pinafore and Trial by Jury). In Toronto, it was first presented by the North Toronto Players in 1999. For the show, new lyrics are often added and musical adjustments made, while keeping true to the humor and musical beauty of the original. For example, the song \\"I am an Englishman\\" was changed to \\"I Am Canadian\\" (which not only made it more local, but made reference to a very popular Molson Canadian beer commercial advertisement which ends with that phrase, see I Am Canadian). It was adapted in Toronto by Michael Harms and John Ricciardelli. Plot The Pinafore is at its starbase being readied for further space exploration. Ralph (pronounced \\"Raif\\") Rackstraw declares his love for Josephine, the daughter of Captain Corcoran. Ralph is supported by most members of the crew with the exception of Dick Deadeye, a Klingon. Little Buttercup, a Betazoid woman who is on board to sell items to the crew, hints that she knows a secret from Ralph's past. The Captain consults his daughter Josephine and reminds her that she has the opportunity to marry Sir Joseph Porter, who is First Lord of the Starfleet Admiralty and a wealthy Ferengi. Sir Joseph arrives with his entourage of 'relatives' (Cousin Hebe and a variety of aliens) and impresses all with his exalted position. Ralph, dejected, informs his friends that he plans to end it all. In a dramatic moment, Josephine declares her love for him and they agree to leave the ship and get married. Ralph and Josephine's stealthy departure with friends from the crew is foiled when they are intercepted by Dick Deadeye and the Captain. Sir Joseph intervenes but is shocked to learn that Ralph has dared to contemplate marriage with Josephine. He orders a court-martial for the insubordinate crewman! Everyone assembles for the trial in which Sir Joseph serves as judge. After several eloquent pleas, the dilemma remains unsolved and Ralph is about to be incarcerated. It is then that Buttercup reveals her secret and provides a happy solution to the social conflict. True love unites all parties in the appropriate way!

It is assigned to the daisy family. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ about the number of species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested. It's called Akkoub () in Arabic, silifa in Greek, Akuvit ha-Galgal () in Hebrew, Kangar () in Armenian and Persian, Kenger in Turkish, and Kereng in Kurdish. Any reference to Kenger in the Turkish language originates from the Kurdish language as, in Turkey, Kenger is native to and grown only in the Kurdish inhabited region. It's called tumble thistle in English.  Description  small plant in flower Gundelia tournefortii is a spiny hemicryptophyte with stems 20‚Äì100 cm high, that branch from the base, the first growth of the plant consists of a rosette of leaves. All parts contain a milky latex. The parts above the surface break from the root and may be blown away by the wind as a tumbleweed, assisting in the dispersion of the seed. All counts executed so far arrive at eighteen chromosomes (2n=18). = Root, stems and leaves = The plant develops a woody, vertical rootstock of up to 4 cm in diameter, at the surface usually covered by the remains of old leaves. The leaves are sessile or decurrent at their base with spiny wings, and alternate set along the stems. The lowest leaves are usually 7‚Äì30 cm long and 4‚Äì16 cm wide, pinnately dissected and the sections of the larger leaves may be pinnately parted themselves, and have a dentate or serrate margin, all tipped with spines. The midvein and sideveins are prominent, whitish, sometimes tinged purple. The leaf surface may be covered in spiderweb-like hairs, that tend to wither away quickly. = Inflorescence = tumbleweed-stage The stem divides into ten or more branches, each of which is topped by a compound spiny ovoid inflorescence of 4‚Äì8 cm in diameter, which may be covered in dense arachnoid hairs. This inflorescence is unusual for members of the family Asteraceae, as each true flowerhead is so far reduced as to only contain one floret, which is surrounded by its own involucre. Five to seven of these monofloral flowerheads combine into secondary flowerheads, each subtended by a spiny bract hardly or substantially longer than the secondary flowerheads, with only the centre floret developing a cypsela, and the surrounding ones only producing pollen. These secondary flowerheads later break free from the globose assembly of flowerheads that sit on the end of each branch of the stem during the tumbleweed-stage. Remarkable for a member of the tribe Cichorieae are also the disk florets, a trait that is further only present in Warionia saharae. cited on = Florets = The pentameric corollas are usually 7‚Äì10 mm long, gloomy purple or yellowish outside, white to bright yellow, greenish, flesh colored or silvery to red purple inside, with spreading narrow lobes of 3‚Äì4 mm mm long and about 1 mm wide, the tube hairless inside. The five merged anthers form a cylinder of 4‚Äì6 mm long, yellow or brownish in color. The style arms are also brownish. = Pollen = Pollen is covered in acute spines. = Fruit and seed = The involucral bracts of the secondary flowerheads are merged into a brown, durable, hard cup with a fibery fringe. Each contains only one cypsela of about 8 mm long, 5 mm at its widest, somewhat dorsally compressed, narrow at its base and widest beyond halflength, with the pappus at its tip consisting of a 2 mm high cup, narrowest at its base. = Characters common to all Asteraceae = Like in all Asteraceae, the pentameric flowers have anthers that are fused together forming a tube through which the style grows. The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an indehiscent fruit in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets (in this case only one) are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre. A particular character of Gudelia that is rare among the Asteraceae is that florets are gender specialised, with the central floret being functionally hermaphrodite and the marginal florets being functionally male. = Characters common to Cichorieae = Tumble thistles are assigned to the Cichorieae-tribe that shares anastomosing latex canals in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In Warionia and Gundelia these are exclusively disk florets, while all other Cichorieae only have ligulate florets. Gundelia is unique in the complex morphology of the inflorescences. = Differences with other genera = Warionia and Gundelia share a thistle-like appearance, anastomosing latex- ducts, floral heads that only contain disk florets, spurred anthers, and styles with branches and highest part of the scape covered with long hairs. Gundelia however is herbaceous, has monofloral primary flowerheads combined into groups of five to seven, the centre floret hermaphrodite, the marginal florets functionally male, and those groups combined in ovoid spiny florescences at the end of the stem, and spiny leaves, florets dull yellow to dull purple on the inside, purple to rusty on the outside. Warionia is a shrub, has many dandelion-yellow florets in each flowerhead, single or with two or three together at the end of the branches, the leaves dentate but not spiny. Scolymus is also a thistle-like herbaceaceous perennial with anastomosing latex-ducts, related to Gundelia, but it has many yellow, orange or white ligulate florets in each flowerhead, which are arranged with many in a spike-like inflorescence, or with a few at the end of the stems. = Phytochemistry = Gundelia contains several essential oils, with large proportions (20-25% each) of thymol and germacrene-D.  Taxonomy  = Taxonomic history = As far as known, the tumble thistle was first collected during an expedition by Leonhard Rauwolf (1573‚Äì1575), and this specimen can now be found in the National Herbarium in Leiden, the Netherlands. Tournefort, Von Gundelsheimer and Claude Aubriet also collected this plant while traveling through Greece, Turkey, former Armenia and Persia (1700‚Äì1702). Since Von Gundelsheimer was the first to have sighted the plant, his companions began to call it Gundelia. Tournefort already observed the remarkable morphology of the compounded flowerheads. Carl Linnaeus in 1753 adopted and published this name, providing the correct name. Henri Cassini in 1821 suggested to assign this species to the tribe Vernonieae. In 1828 he specified this assignment to the Vernonieae-Rolandreae, a group formalized by Christian Friedrich Lessing as subtribe Rolandrinae in 1831. Following a change in the interpretation of the complex inflorescence, Cassini rejected the interpretation by Linnaeus, and erected the genus Gundelsheimera, which is illegitimate as it is based on the same type specimen. Next, George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1873 placed the species in the tribe Arctotideae, subtribe Gundelieae (corrected name Gundelinae). Pierre Edmond Boissier in 1875 thought this taxon sufficiently divergent to erect the tribe Gundelieae. Karl August Otto Hoffmann misspelled the genus name as Grundelia, while remarking that Gundelsheimera is a synonym. Other authors hesitantly considered a position for Gundelia in the Cardueae sensu lato. It recently has also been combined with Warionia in the tribe Gundelieae by C. Jeffrey. = Number of species = a plant with purple corollas The earliest descriptions of Gundelia recognise that the corollas could be cream, flesh coloured or purplish. Linnaeus regarded the genus as monospecific, but distinguished plants with purple corollas as variety Œ≤. Bornm√ºller in 1939 distinguished a forma purpurascens. Other infraspecific taxa differ only in leaf characters. Many modern authors recognise only Gundelia tournefortii with a wide variation in corolla color, or both G. tournefortii and a much more uniform G. aragatsi Nersesyan with brown red corollas and very downy inflorescences. Other species distinguished by some authors are G. armeniaca Nersesyan, G. dersim Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin, G. glabra Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin and G. munzuriensis Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin, G. rosea Al-Taey & Hossain, G. tenuisecta Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin and Gundelia vitekii Armaƒüan. = Modern classification = Debate on the number of subtaxa remains and some authors think there is only one species, Gundelia tournefortii. Others also recognise G. aragatsi, a form only known from Armenia, that has brown red corollas and very felty inflorescences. Some even distinguish up to nine different taxa. Gundelia is now assigned to the Cichorieae-tribe, as the basal member of the Scolyminae-subtribe. = Phylogeny = According to recent genetic analyses, the genus Gundelia is related to the genera Hymenonema, Scolymus and Catananche. This results in the following relationship tree. = Etymology = Pedanius Dioscorides called this plant silybum. The genus Gundelia is named to honor Andreas von Gundelsheimer (1668‚Äì1715), a German botanist, while the species name tournefortii was named after Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, a French botanist, who together undertook a botanical journey to the Levant, during which the species was collected, described and illustrated.  Distribution  The tumble thistle can be found in Cyprus, Turkey (Anatolia), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Northern Iraq, northern Iran, Afghanistan, western Syria, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. It has been introduced in Algeria.  Ecology  Gundelia grows on limestone, igneous rock or reddish soils, in steppe, open oak or pine woodland, or between coppices, as weed in barley- or cornfields, fallowed or deserted fields, and in roadsides. It can be found at altitudes up to 2500 m. It is pollinated by insects such as honey bees and pollen feeding beetles, such as the Garden Chafer.  Cultivation  Seeds germinate slowly and may take several years. Seedlings can be planted outside but required light, well-drained soil, and protection against frost. Growth is slow during the first year. Plants can be grown in the rock garden, or on raised beds. Gundelia is probably hardy to about ‚àí15 ¬∞C when the drainage is good. Plants have been grown intermittently at the √âcole de Botanique and in what is currently known as the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, since the 18th century.  Use  Young Gundelia-stems prepared for using as food = Food = Early in the year, Gundelia plants growing in the wild are cut at the base and the thorns are removed. Leaves, stems, roots, and particularly the undeveloped flowerheads can be eaten. The base of the young leaves which is still under the surface is used by Bedouin and Arabs to make akkub soup. In the West Bank, young flowerheads, stems and leaves are fried in olive oil, mixed with a stew of meat chops until well done, and served mixed with yogurt. Gundelia is said to taste like something between asparagus and artichoke. Another dish is to put a trimmed inflorescence in a meatball, fry these in olive oil and then simmer them in a sauce containing lemon juice. In rural communities in northern Iraq, Gundelia is still being used as a vegetable, but in Israel collecting for the market resulted in a decline in the plant population and collecting is restricted to personal use. A chewing gum can be made from the latex, a fact that is already mentioned by Tournefort in 1718, and is called \\"kenger sakƒ±zƒ±\\" in Turkish. The fruits as well as roots can be roasted and ground to be used as substitute coffee, and is known as \\"kenger kahvesi\\". In recent times, mature seeds have been used to extract oil. Remains of charred inflorescences of Gundelia from the neolithic found in Turkey and Iraq indicate that oil was pressed from the seeds as long as at least 10,000 years ago. The seeds are edible (called ÿ≥ÿ≥ŸëŸä \\"Sissi\\" in Northern Iraq); dried, salted and roasted are sold in nut shops, the taste similar to sun flower seeds. The cypselas contain almost 7% oleic acid and 12¬Ω% linoleic acid, making the oil comparable to soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. Commercial use would be dependent on plant breeding to improve crop yield, suitability for harvesting and for food processing, such as selection of spineless plants. = Medical uses = Traditionally, Gundelia is used to treat a wide variety of ailments such as liver diseases, diabetes, chest pain, heart attacks, pain in the chest and the stomach, leukoderma, diarrhea and bronchitis. In addition hypoglycaemic, laxative, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasite, antiseptic and emetic effects have been claimed, as well as improvement of the gums and curing spleen enlargement. Proven effects include antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antiplatelet and cholesterol suppression. = Fodder = Fully grown foliage is used to feed livestock in spite of the spines, both fresh (in Syria and Palestine) and dry (in Kurdistan and Iran).  Culture  In 1998 pollen found on the Shroud of Turin was analysed and with 29%, the pollen assigned to Gundelia was the most numerous. Such a high density makes it very unlikely that this would merely be the result of the Shroud having been exposed to the wind, particularly because Gundelia is an insect-pollinated, not a wind-pollinated plant. Some researchers have suggested this implies that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia-branches. Other authors doubt the accuracy of the pollen analysis and of the process of gathering the pollen from the Shroud. One reason for doubt is that during the period that pollen is present in the plant, the thorns would have still been tender. It was suggested the pollen is from Helichrysum-species which have a similar type of pollen. Helichrysum was used in classical times to make crowns and garlands for the diseased because they do not wither and remain scented for a long time. An alternative explanation suggested is that rather more recent different flowers have been pressed against the Shroud to create contact relics, while in the process contaminating it with pollen and therefore diluting the original pollen signature. Some Bible scholars think that the tumbleweed that is spoken of in Psalm 83, verse 14 \\"Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like galgal before the wind\\" is Gundelia. Akkub, the biblical name for this species, is already mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.

Politics = Federal Politics=  Liberal Party  Kinsella served as a strategist in the Canadian federal Liberal Party's 1993 election campaign \\"task force\\", and worked as a media adviser to opposition leader Jean Chr√©tien's office.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984‚Äì2008, Toronto: University of Toronto Press page 198 After the Liberals won the election, Kinsella became chief of staff to federal Public Works minister David Dingwall for a short time. Lawrence Martin noted in his book Iron Man that Kinsella was accused by Peter Donolo, Chr√©tien's communications director, of being overtly aggressive and seeing enemies everywhere.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Viking: Toronto, 2003 page 240. In addition, Martin noted that many Liberal MPs expressed concern about Kinsella's behaviour. However, Kinsella was a favourite of Aline Chr√©tien, the Prime Minister's wife, which meant that the complaints were ignored. Kinsella ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1997 federal election in the riding of North Vancouver but was defeated by Reform incumbent Ted White. During his last stint as a national campaign headquarters worker during the 2000 Canadian federal election, he appeared on CTV's Canada AM brandishing a purple Barney dinosaur doll to mock what he claimed were Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day's creationist beliefs. Public affairs consultant Robin Sears in Policy Options used this incident to compare him to American Political Consultant James Carvile and argued that \\"The Carvillites and their young fans were less con- cerned with the substance of pol- itics or its impact on citizens' building contempt for politics than with their personal scores.\\" After the 2000 federal election, Kinsella was a vocal supporter of Chretien during the intra-party struggle that resulted in Chretien being replaced by Paul Martin. In Iron Man, Lawerence Martin noted that Kinsella saw Paul Martin and his followers \\"as almost much an enemy\\" as the opposition parties, and favored working against the Martin faction.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 39. He would work on Liberal leadership campaigns for Allan Rock and Sheila Copps in opposition to Martin. He later admitted to quitting the Liberal Party when then-cabinet minister Herb Dhaliwal had his Vancouver South-Burnaby riding association taken over by the Martin forces in November 2002. Starting in November 2008, Kinsella worked briefly for Liberal leadership candidate Michael Ignatieff. One long-time senior Liberal questioned the hiring of Kinsella, calling him a \\"human shrapnel machine.\\" Later that month Kinsella apologized for a post in his video blog that jokingly mentioned that his regular Chinese restaurant sold \\"cat meat.\\" Kinsella resigned from Ignatieff's campaign in May 2009, citing treatment of fired colleagues. Kinsella publicly considered seeking the Liberal nomination for the 2015 federal election in Toronto‚ÄîDanforth, but ultimately demurred after believing he would not be approved as a nominee. He argued that Trudeau's inner circle' played a role in the ouster of Jean Chretien as Prime Minister. He has been a critic of Justin Trudeau's leadership. https://torontosun.com/news/national/election-2019/kinsella-why-i- cant-vote-liberal-on-oct-21 During the 2019 Election, Kinsella tweets drew attention as he accused Justin Trudeau for buying drinks for Faith Goldy in a deleted post, tweeted false accusations of a suppressed Globe & Mail Story, and noted a fake website that advocated Chystria Freeland as leader of the Liberal party. After the election, Kinsella praised Trudeau by stating that he handled the right way since the election stating \\"\\"No stunts, no selfies, no over-saturation\\"\\".  Gomery inquiry  During the Gomery Commission's inquiry into the Sponsorship scandal, Justice John Gomery was told that Kinsella, while chief of staff to Minister of Public Works David Dingwall, wrote a letter to the department's Deputy Minister, Ran Quail in 1994 requesting Chuck Guit√© be appointed to review the government's advertising and communications strategy. Quail said he viewed the letter as political interference into civil service affairs, while Dingwall and Kinsella characterized the letter as a request rather than a directive. No finding of any fault was found in Gomery's report relating to Kinsella's conduct.http://www.yorku.ca/igreene/gomfactVI.pdf  Green Party  Kinsella worked for the Canadian Green Party during July of 2019 in the run-up to the 2019 Canadian federal election. This work was a temporary arrangement and involved \\"Kinsella setting up a quick-response unit for the Greens.\\" Conservative Party of Canada In October 2019, the Globe and Mail reported that Kinsella's consulting firm, Daisy Group, had, according to an anonymous source, been hired by the Conservative Party of Canada to create a campaign attempting to discredit Maxime Bernier and the People's Party of Canada. Neither the Conservative Party nor Kinsella would confirm or deny that they are ‚Äì or have been ‚Äì working together. Bernier filed a complaint to the Commissioner of Canada Elections. On October 19, 2019, Kinsella deactivated his Twitter and Facebook accounts and posted a statement on his website that he is \\"pulling back from (social) media.\\" On October 22, 2019, Kinsella called on the Commissioner of Canada Elections to investigate the role that his own firm played. On 29 October 2019 Kinsella said on his podcast that he would not reveal the who hired his company, maintaining that it was protected by solicitor-client privilege but stated the campaign should have been disclosed earlier. On November 2, Kory Teneycke cited Andrew Scheer handling of the Kinsella story to the Toronto Star as one of the example questioning Scheer future as the leader of the Conservative Party. While, CBC revealed, on November 26, 2019, a recording describing Kinsella's contempt of Bernier and identified that Conservative campaign manager Hamish Marshall and co-chair, John Walsh potentially knew about the campaign. After filing a $1 milllion lawsuit, Kinsella later settled out of court with the source; who was a former Daisy Employee, Aziza Mohammed. On December, 08, the Globe and Mail, reported that it was a lack of clarity \\"what other activities were part of the project\\" and that \\"The Conservative Party will eventually have to report all of its spending and third-party contracts to Elections Canada\\". While, Kinsella and his firm did not break the Elections Canada Act (which only governs spending), CBC News suggested that story might not end. In February 2020, Bernier launched a lawsuit alleging defamation against Kinsella. = Provincial politics =  Ontario Liberals  Kinsella was a long time supporter of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty, and was a fixture in Ontario Liberal Party election campaigns while McGuinty was leader. The Hill Times stated that Kinsella was the individual that branded Ontario Progressive Conservatives Leader John Tory's promise to publicly fund faith-based schools during the 2007 election \\"into a Canadian version of Nixon's racist Southern strategy\\". He would apologize for a blog post during the campaign suggesting that Progressive Conservative MPP Lisa MacLeod would rather bake cookies than be seen with farm activist Randy Hillier; MacLeod would later use the remark as the humorous title for a cookbook. Kinsella supported Sandra Pupatello in the 2013 Liberal Party of Ontario leadership convention that chose a successor to McGuinty. The leadership was won by Kathleen Wynne. Kinsella was sharply critical of Wynne's campaign during the 2014 Ontario election, and subsequently.  Ontario Progressive Conservatives  On October 31, 2019, the Globe and Mail reported that a spokesperson for Autistics for Autistics (A4A), an Ontario Autism advocacy group, threatened ligation against Kinsella after warning Kinsella's Daisy firm over a suspected connection between free media training provided by his firm and the Ontario government led by premier Doug Ford. Kinsella stated that his work was unrelated with strategic advice and media training provided to Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Lisa MacLeod and her political staff in March 2018 over the restrictions to the provincial autism program. While House leader Paul Calandra, who was asked by reporters if he would release the contract, stated that Daisy' firm services was for social assistance not autism = Municipal politics = Kinsella advised John Tory in the 2003 Toronto mayoral election. In 2014 mayoral election, Kinsella assisted Olivia Chow's campaign. On August 20, 2014, Kinsella tweeted \\"Is John Tory's SmartTrack, you know, Segregationist Track?\\", and posted a photo featuring Tory and an edited speech bubble stating that Jane/Finch and Rexdale were intentionally excluded from the plan. Kinsella apologized for the incident. Daisy Consulting later announced that they had fired Chow as a client due to remarks regarding Kinsella. After a Twitter showdown between Tory's strategist Nick Kouvalis; Kinsella sued Kouvalis for $100,000 libel suit over tweets that Kinsella alleges were slanderous. Kouvalis was later reported by the Toronto Star as the person responsible for bring Kinsella as an advisor to John Tory during the 2018 Toronto mayoral election. On November 16, 2018 the OPP charged Mark Grimes along with outgoing city councillor Justin Di Ciano for allegedly filing false campaign expenses for the 2014 municipal elections, contrary to the Municipal Elections Act. In order to fight the allegations, then- councillor Di Ciano and Grimes hired the firm of strategist Kinsella to compile a \\"research\\" dossier on him and political foes such as CBC News. A few months later, Grimes faced litigation by Kinsella for allegedly failing to pay invoices for services rendered by Kinsella's Daisy Group.  Writing  In 1997, Kinsella published the novel Party Favours, a thinly veiled roman √† clef about the Chr√©tien government similar to the 1996 American novel Primary Colors.\\"Political punk\\". The Globe and Mail, August 20, 2005. The novel was initially credited to \\"Jean Doe\\",\\"Author of Party Favours keeping identity a secret\\". Toronto Star, September 17, 1997. with Kinsella only later revealing himself as the real author. Macleans associated \\"Prince of Darkness\\" with dirty politics because \\"His political books are thick with tales of dirty tricks and nasty business in Ottawa's corridors of power, and he is an admitted and most gleeful practitioner of both.\\" Kinsella runs a blog that is famous in Canadian political circles for Kinsella's on-and-off feuds with other bloggers, including one with columnist Ezra Levant that prompted Kinsella to initiate a defamation suit claiming $5,000,000 in damages. In March 2019, Kinsella started as a Toronto Sun columnist. After, it was revealed Kinsella's consulting firm worked with the Conservative Party. Canadaland reported that Sun management did not respond to questions about whether they were aware of Kinsella doing paid work on behalf of the Conservatives, but a spokesperson for parent company Postmedia stated in an email that \\"Postmedia is unaware of any financial arrangement that Warren Kinsella might have had with a political party while writing a column for the Toronto Sun.

Moulin Rouge is a 1952 British drama film directed by John Huston, produced by John and James Woolf for their Romulus Films company and released by United Artists. The film is set in Paris in the late 19th century, following artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in the city's bohemian subculture in and around the burlesque palace the Moulin Rouge. The screenplay is by Huston, based on the 1950 novel by Pierre La Mure. The cinematography was by Oswald Morris. This film was screened at the 14th Venice International Film Festival where it won the Silver Lion. The film stars Jos√© Ferrer as Toulouse-Lautrec, with Zsa Zsa Gabor as Jane Avril, Suzanne Flon, Eric Pohlmann, Colette Marchand, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Katherine Kath, Theodore Bikel, and Muriel Smith. Plot In 1890 Paris crowds pour into the Moulin Rouge nightclub as artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec finishes a bottle of cognac while sketching the club's dancers. The club's regulars arrive: singer Jane Avril teases Henri charmingly, dancers La Goulue and Aicha fight, and owner Maurice Joyant offers Henri free drinks for a month in exchange for painting a promotional poster. At closing time, Henri waits for the crowds to disperse before standing to reveal his four-foot six-inch stature. As he walks to his Montmartre apartment, he recalls the events that led to his disfigurement. It is revealed that Lautrec as a boy fell down a flight of stairs, whereupon his legs failed to heal because of a genetic weakness resulting from his parents being first cousins. His legs stunted and pained, Henri loses himself in his art, while his father leaves his mother, the countess, to ensure that they have no more children. Henri is a bright, happy child, revered by his father, the Count de Toulouse-Lautrec. As a young adult, he proposes to the woman he loves but, when she tells him that no woman will ever love him, he leaves his childhood home in despair to begin a new life as a painter in Paris. Back in the present, street walker Marie Charlet begs Henri to rescue her from police sergeant Patou. Henri wards off the policeman by pretending to be her escort, after which she insists on following him home. There, she addresses his small stature and, although he is at first angry, he allows her to stay and is charmed when she claims not to care about his legs. Within days, he is buying her gifts and singing as he paints, until Marie takes his money and stays out all night. Henri waits in agony for her return, but when she finally does he tells her to leave at once. Realizing he loves her, Marie vows to stay and love him back. Though she continues to fight with him, he tells himself her crassness stems from her poverty, and lets her stay. During one fight Marie tells Henri he can never attract a real woman, and leaves. By morning, she begs him to take her back, but he refuses. He begins drinking and does not stop until his landlady calls his mother, who urges him to save his health by finding Marie. Henri searches Marie's working-class neighborhood, finally discovering her at a caf√©, where she drunkenly reveals she stayed with him only to procure money for her boyfriend. When she adds that his touch made her sick, Henri returns to his apartment, and turns on the gas vents. As he sits waiting to die, he is suddenly inspired to finish his Moulin Rouge poster and, brush in hand, distractedly turns the vents off again. The next day, Henri brings the poster to the dance hall and, though the style is unusual, Maurice accepts it. Henri works for days at the lithographers, blending his own inks to perfect the vivid colors. When he finishes the poster, which shows a woman dancing with her legs exposed, it becomes an instant sensation and the Moulin Rouge opens to high society. His father denounces Henri for the \\"pornographic\\" work. Over the next ten years, Henri records Parisian life in brilliant paintings. By 1900 he is famous, but still terribly lonely. One day he sees Myriamme Hyam standing at the edge of Pont Alexandre III over the Seine River. Thinking she might jump, he stops to talk to her. She spurns his advances and throws a key into the water. Days later, Jane, a friend of Myriamme, arranges a meeting for them. Myriamme is a great admirer of Henri's paintings, and the two begin to spend time together. She soon reveals to Henri that the key she threw into the water belonged to a married man, Marcel de la Voisier, who asked her to be his mistress. While Henri continues to decry the possibility of true love he falls in love with Myriamme. One day the two see dancer La Goulue on the street drunkenly insisting that she was once a star. Henri realizes that the Moulin Rouge has become a respectable establishment and no longer the home for misfits. Myriamme informs Henri that Marcel has asked her to marry him. Certain she loves the more handsome man, he bitingly congratulates her for trapping Marne. Myriamme asks Henri if he loves her, but, believing that she is only trying to spare his feelings, he lies and tells her he does not. By the time he receives a letter from her stating that she loves him, but cannot wait any longer, Myriamme has left the city and Henri goes on an unsuccessful search for her. Weeks later, while sitting in a dive drinking steadily, Henri repeatedly reads Myriamme's note. Patou, now an inspector, is called to help him. Once home, in a state of delirium tremens, Henri hallucinates that he sees cockroaches, and in trying to drive them away, accidentally falls down a flight of stairs. Near death, Henri is brought to his family home. After a priest reads the last rites, his father tearfully informs Henri that he is to be the first living artist to be shown in the Louvre, and begs for forgiveness. Henri turns his head and watches as phantasmal characters from his Moulin Rouge paintings, including Jane Avril, dance into the room to bid him goodbye before his death.

To transform Ferrer into Henri required the use of platforms and concealed pits as well as special camera angles, makeup and costumes. Short body doubles were also used. In addition, Ferrer used a set of knee-pads of his own design allowing him to walk on his knees . He received high praise not only for his performance, but for his willingness to have his legs strapped in such a manner simply to play a role. It was reported that John Huston asked cinematographer Oswald Morris to render the color scheme of the film to look \\"as if Toulouse-Lautrec had directed it\\".Tom Vallance, \\"Obituary: Sir John Woolf\\", The Independent, 1 July 1999 Moulin Rouge was shot in three-strip Technicolor. The Technicolor projection print is created by dye transfer from three primary-color gelatin matrices. This permits great flexibility in controlling the density, contrast, and saturation of the print. Huston asked Technicolor for a subdued palette, rather than the sometimes-gaudy colors \\"glorious Technicolor\\" was famous for. Technicolor was reportedly reluctant to do this. The film was shot at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, and on location in London and Paris. Reception During its first year of release it earned ¬£205,453 in UK cinemasVincent Porter, 'The Robert Clark Account', Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Vol 20 No 4, 2000 p.499 and grossed $9 million at the North American box office.

They contrast with figurehead presidents, common in most parliamentary republics, in which the president serves symbolic, nonpolitical roles (and often is appointed to office by parliament) while the prime minister holds all relevant executive power. A small number of nations, most notably South Africa and Botswana, have both an executive presidency and a system of governance that is parliamentary in character, with the President elected by and dependent on the confidence of the legislature. In these states, the offices of president and prime minister (as both head of state and head of government respectively) might be said to be combined. The above examples notwithstanding, executive presidencies are found in presidential systems and semi-presidential systems. In order to prevent the abuse of power, checks and balances are implemented through the legislative and judiciary bodies. For example, in the United States one method is impeachment whereby the president can be held accountable if others deem their actions unconstitutional, with the most recent example being the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.  Elections  In parliamentary republics, presidents are most commonly chosen by the legislature. However, in those countries with both a prime minister and a president, methods differ. For example, in Ireland a plurality vote from the public elects the president. In presidential and semi-presidential systems, the president is elected independently of the legislature. There are several methods in which to do this, including the plurality system and the two-round system. Whilst these methods use the popular vote, not all presidents are chosen in this way. For example, to be elected in the United States, a candidate must win a majority of the votes from the Electoral College - not the popular vote.

She was the mother of musician and producer Michael Nesmith of The Monkees. Biography Graham was born Bette Clair McMurray, in Dallas, Texas, to Jesse McMurray, an automotive supply company manager, and Christine Duval.Texas Birth Index, \\"Robert Micheal Nesmith\\" born 1942, retrieved from Ancestry.com, lists his mother's full birth name. She was raised in San Antonio and graduated from Alamo Heights High School. She married Warren Audrey Nesmith (1919‚Äì1984) before he left to fight in World War II. While he was overseas she had a child (Robert Michael Nesmith, born December 30, 1942). After Warren Nesmith returned home, they divorced (1946). Her father died in the early 1950s, leaving some property in Dallas to Bette. She, her mother, Michael, and her sister Yvonne moved there. To support herself as a single mother, she worked as a secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. She eventually attained the position of the executive secretary, the highest position open at that time to women in the industry. It was difficult to erase mistakes made by early electric typewriters, which caused problems. To make extra money, she used her talent painting holiday windows at the bank. She realized as she said, \\"with lettering, an artist never corrects by erasing, but always paints over the error. So I decided to use what artists use. I put some tempera water-based paint in a bottle and took my watercolor brush to the office. I used to correct my mistakes.\\" Graham secretly used her white correction paint for five years, making some improvements with help from her son's chemistry teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas. Some bosses admonished her for using it, but coworkers frequently sought her \\"paint out\\". She eventually began marketing her typewriter correction fluid as \\"Mistake Out\\" in 1956. The name was later changed to Liquid Paper when she began her own company. Mistake Out started the 1960s operating at a small loss, with Nesmith's home doubling as company headquarters. As the product became an indispensable tool of the secretarial trade, Nesmith relocated production and shipping from her kitchen to a 10 foot-by-26 foot portable metal structure in her backyard, where packaging, shipping, and production were centered. Bette Nesmith married Robert Graham in 1962; he joined her in running the company. They divorced in 1975. She sold Liquid Paper to the Gillette Corporation for USD $47.5 million in 1979. At the time, her company employed 200 people and made 25 million bottles of Liquid Paper per year. Bette Nesmith died on May 12, 1980, at the age of 56, in Richardson, Texas after suffering a stroke. Management style From the start, Graham ran her company with a unique combination of spirituality, egalitarianism, and pragmatism. Raised a Baptist, Graham converted to Christian Science in 1942, and this faith inspired the development of her corporate \\"Statement of Policy\\". Part-code of ethics, part-business philosophy, it covered everything from her belief in a \\"Supreme Being\\" to a focus on decentralized decision making and an emphasis on product quality over the pursuit of profit. She also believed that women could bring a more nurturing and humanistic quality to the male world of business, and provided a greenbelt with a fish pond, an employee library, and a childcare center in her new company headquarters in 1975. Legacy Her only son, a musician Michael Nesmith (best known as a member of The Monkees), inherited half of his mother's estate of over $50 million. A portion financed the Gihon Foundation which established the Council on Ideas, a think tank with a retreat center located north of Santa Fe, New Mexico active from 1990 to 2000 and devoted to exploring world problems. Additionally, a portion of Graham's estate financed Betty Clair McMurray Foundation, which focuses on supporting projects such as the exhibit Texas Women, A Celebration of History, career guidance for unwed mothers, shelter and counseling for battered women, and college scholarships for mature women. In 2018 The New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

The blue silica gel in the space below the platform is used as the desiccant. Desiccators are sealable enclosures containing desiccants used for preserving moisture-sensitive items such as cobalt chloride paper for another use. A common use for desiccators is to protect chemicals which are hygroscopic or which react with water from humidity. The contents of desiccators are exposed to atmospheric moisture whenever the desiccators are opened. It also requires some time to achieve a low humidity. Hence they are not appropriate for storing chemicals which react quickly or violently with atmospheric moisture such as the alkali metals; a glovebox or Schlenk-type apparatus may be more suitable for these purposes. Desiccators are sometimes used to remove traces of water from an almost-dry sample. Where a desiccator alone is unsatisfactory, the sample may be dried at elevated temperature using Abderhalden's drying pistol. Constituents The lower compartment of the desiccator contains lumps of silica gel, freshly calcined quicklime, Drierite or (not as effective) anhydrous calcium chloride to absorb water vapor. The substance needing desiccation is put in the upper compartment, usually on a glazed, perforated ceramic plate. The ground-glass rim of the desiccator lid must be greased with a thin layer of vacuum grease, petroleum jelly or other lubricant to ensure an airtight seal. In order to prevent damage to a desiccator the lid should be carefully slid on and off instead of being directly placed onto the base. Operation In laboratory use, the most common desiccators are circular and made of heavy glass. There is usually a removable platform on which the items to be stored are placed. The desiccant, usually an otherwise-inert solid such as silica gel, fills the space under the platform. Colour changing silica may be used to indicate when it should be refreshed. Indication gels typically change from blue to pink as they absorb moisture but other colours may be used. A stopcock may be included to permit the desiccator to be evacuated. Such models are usually known as vacuum desiccators. When a vacuum is to be applied, it is a common practice to criss-cross the vacuum desiccator with tape, or to place it behind a screen to minimize damage or injury caused by an implosion. To maintain a good seal, vacuum grease is usually applied to the flanges.

There are other levels of precepts, varying amongst traditions. In Theravadan tradition there are Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts, and the Patimokkha. Eight Precepts are a more rigorous practice for laypeople. Ten Precepts are the training rules for samaneras and samaneris, novice monks and nuns, respectively. The Patimokkha is the basic Theravada code of monastic discipline, consisting of 227 rules for monks, (bhikkhus) and 311 rules for nuns (bhikkhunis). Secular law In secular law, a precept is a command in writing; a species of writ issued from a court or other legal authority. It is now chiefly used of an order demanding payment (in the UK, for example, the term is applied by local precepting authorities as part of the Council Tax system). The Latin form praecipe (i.e., to enjoin, command) is used of the note of instructions delivered by a plaintiff or his lawyer to be filed by the officer of the court, giving the names of the plaintiff and defendant. Higher education Princeton University uses the term precept to describe what many other universities refer to as recitations: large classes are often divided into several smaller discussion sections called precepts, which are led by the professor or graduate teaching assistants. Precepts or recitations usually meet once a week to supplement the lectures and provide a venue for discussion of the course material.Aaron Sommers, The Nature of Time.

He opposed the liberal Constitution of 1857 and served as President of Mexico in opposition to the constitutional president, Benito Ju√°rez of the Liberal Party. He was one the youngest rulers and the first not born during Spanish colonial rule. He served in the imperial army during the French Intervention in Mexico and was executed with Emperor Maximilian and General Tom√°s Mej√≠a by a republican army firing squad. He remains a controversial figure in Mexico, combining \\"military skill with political miscalculation.\\"Hamnett, Brian. \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996, vol. 4, p. 67. Early life Miram√≥n was born in Mexico City in 1831 into a very traditional family of partial French heritage. He was the son of Colonel Bernardo de Miram√≥n and his wife Carmen Tarelo, who apparently had twelve offspring. Some of them were Joaquin, Carlos and Mariano; these appeared next to his brother in his various military campaigns. At the age of 15, he fought bravely but was taken prisoner while a cadet by the U.S. Army in the September 1847 defending on Chapultepec Castle in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Hamnett, \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\", p. 67. Career Miguel Miram√≥n wearing a general's court dress during Maximilian's reign He was a staunch conservative, typical of most Mexican army officers, and a supporter of aristocracy and religious privileges (fueros) for the Catholic Church and the army. In 1854-55, he fought with conservative General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, then President of Mexico, against liberals who overthrew him in the Revolution of Ayutla that brought liberals to power. During the administration of President Ignacio Comonfort, he played a role in the city of Puebla's resistance to the liberals in 1856, and was imprisoned in 1857 after the promulgation of the new liberal Constitution of 1857. =War of Reform and presidency= During the War of Reform (1858-1861), he was the principal general of the conservative army. He fought in the north and the central lowlands on the side of the conservatives, which had ousted the liberal regime of Benito Ju√°rez, who had succeeded to the presidency of Mexico after the resignation of Comonfort. He was victorious in some early battles at Salamanca, Atentique, Ahualulco, but twice failed to take the liberal stronghold of Veracruz. He left the country after the conservative defeat, but played no part in the subsequent conservative efforts that brought Maximilian Hapsburg in the French Intervention in Mexico.Hamnett, \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\", p. 67. Several presidents were appointed by different conservative factions. Miram√≥n's faction eventually prevailed, and on February 2nd 1860, not yet 30 years old, he assumed the presidency in the zone controlled by the conservatives. On 11 April 1859, Miram√≥n ordered the execution of not only captured liberal officers but also the doctors who had treated their wounds, as well as numerous civilians deemed sympathetic to the liberal forces. Liberals had just suffered a defeat in attempting to retake the capital from the junta now headed by Miram√≥n. As a result of this massacre, liberal General Santos Degollado ordered officers of the conservative armies shot upon capture. Between 12 August and 15 August 1860, he left the presidency to an interim, Jos√© Ignacio Pav√≥n. According to some sources, he also used the Mexico City police to raid the residence of the British consul (who was actively supporting the liberals) and steal 600,000 pesos to finance a conservative levy. He maintained hostilities against the liberals until he was defeated by the troops of Gen. Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Ortega in San Juan del R√≠o, Quer√©taro, on 22 December. Two days later, Miram√≥n resigned and left for exile in Havana, Cuba. =Second Empire= The Execution of Emperor Maximilian (1868‚Äì69), flanked by Generals Miguel Miram√≥n and Tom√°s Mej√≠a by Eduard Manet, oil on canvas, 252 x 305 cm. Kunsthalle Mannheim While in France, he did not take part in the negotiations between the Mexican monarchists, Napoleon III and the Archduke Maximilian of Austria.Hamnett, \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\", p. 67. When he returned to Mexico on July 28, 1863, the archduke, now crowned as Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, appointed him as Great Marshal of the Imperial Army and sent him to Berlin to study military tactics. However, the war which had lead to constant victory for the French and their allies was beginning to turn. Republican forces were now returning with support from the United States in the form of weapons and supplies. The conservatives was joining imperial forces the retreat from mainland Mexico. Miram√≥n returned in 1866 and organized the imperial defenses against the Republicans in a attempt to keep his allies fighting. On 19 February 1867, Miram√≥n, faithful to his allies, arrived at Quer√©taro to break the liberal siege holding emperor Maximilian. He took charge of the infantry and sent General Tom√°s Mej√≠a to take charge of the cavalry and rally up support for a breakout attempt. The attempt failed, however, and three months later the emperor capitulated to the republicans, against the advice of the seriously wounded Miram√≥n. On 19 June all three were shot for treason on the order of republican President Benito Ju√°rez. The execution took place at the Cerro de las Campanas in the outskirts of Quer√©taro, practically ending the Second Mexican Empire and the conservative cause. =Assessment= Miram√≥n was a talented leader, evidenced by his presidency and his high military commands during the reform war and the French intervention. He fought in defense of both his country and his factions against Americans and Mexican Liberals with unwavering and patriotic resolve. However, the defeat of his conservative faction forced Miram√≥n to leave his country, and his support of the French Empire ended with both his death and the death of Mexican conservatism on the battlefield. The commander was indefatigably dedicated in his beliefs, remaining loyal to his allies even as all hope was lost and the his liberal enemies advanced on all fronts around him. General Miram√≥n fought valorously on the losing side of history.

Design work began in 1942, the first of three prototype XC-97s flew on 9 November 1944 (none saw combat), and the first of six service-test YC-97s flew on 11 March 1947. All nine were based on the 24ST alloy structure and Wright R-3350 engines of the B-29, but with a larger-diameter fuselage upper lobe (making a figure of eight or \\"double-bubble\\" section) and they had the B-29 vertical tail with the gunner's position blanked off. The first of three heavily revised YC-97A incorporating the re-engineered wing ( higher strength 75ST alloy), taller vertical tail and larger Pratt and Whitney R-4360 engines of the B-50 bomber, flew on 28 January 1948 and was the basis of the subsequent sole YC-97B, all production C-97s, KC-97s and civilian Stratocruiser aircraft. Between 1944 and 1958, 888 C-97s in several versions were built, 811 being KC-97 tankers.Bach 1996, p. 7Bowers 1989, pp. 353‚Äì359. C-97s served in the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Some aircraft served as flying command posts for the Strategic Air Command, while others were modified for use in Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadrons (ARRS). Design and development The C-97 Stratofreighter was developed towards the end of World War II by fitting an enlarged upper fuselage onto a lower fuselage and wings that were essentially the same as those of the B-29 Superfortress with the tail, wing, and engine layout being nearly identical.Swanborough and Bowers 1989, p. 125. It was built before the death of Boeing president Philip G. Johnson. It can be easily distinguished from the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser by the \\"beak\\" radome beneath the nose and by the flying boom and jet engines on later tanker models. The prototype XC-97 was powered by the Wright R-3350 engine, the same as used in the B-29. The XC-97 took off for its first flight on November 9, 1944.Bowers 1989, p. 353. YC-97 Stratofreighter with the shorter fin and smaller engines of the B-29 in 1947 On 9 January 1945, the first prototype, piloted by Major Curtin L. Reinhardt, flew from Seattle to Washington, D.C. in 6 hours 4 minutes, an average speed of with of cargo, which (at that time) was impressive for such a large aircraft. Production models featured the Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major engine, the same engine as for the B-50. The tenth and all subsequent aircraft were fitted with the taller fin and rudder of the B-50 Superfortress. The C-97 had clamshell doors under its tail, so that two retractable ramps could be used to drive in cargo. However, unlike the later Lockheed C-130 Hercules, it was not designed as a combat transport that could deliver directly to primitive forward bases using relatively short takeoffs and landings. The two rear ramps could not be used in flight; but removed, the C-97 could be used for air drops. The C-97 had a useful payload of and could carry two normal trucks, towed artillery, or light tracked vehicles such as the M56 Scorpion. The C-97 was also the first mass-produced air transport to feature cabin pressurization, which made long range missions somewhat more comfortable for its crew and passengers. The civilian derivative of the C-97 was the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, a very luxurious transoceanic airliner that featured a lower deck lounge and could be fitted with sleeper cabins. The first Stratocruiser flew on July 8, 1947. Only 56 were built.Bach 1996, p. 40  Operational history  The C-97 entered service in 1947, during a period of rapid development of heavy transport aircraft. Only 77 were built before the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II was delivered in 1950, with nearly twice the payload capacity of the C-97. The USAF Strategic Air Command operated C-97 Stratofreighters from 1949 to 1978. Early in its service life, it served as an airborne alternative SAC command post. While only 77 C-97 transports were built, 811 were built as KC-97 Stratofreighters for inflight refueling. The KC-97 began to be phased out with the introduction of the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker in 1957. Many KC-97s were later refitted as C-97G transports and equipped several squadrons of the U.S. Air National Guard. One YC-97A (45‚Äì59595) was used in the Berlin Airlift during April 1949, operating for the 1st Strategic Support Squadron. It suffered a landing gear accident at Gatow and by the time it was repaired, the Soviet Blockade was lifted. C-97s evacuated casualties during the Korean War. C-97s also participated in the Biafran airlift, delivering relief materials to Uli airstrip in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War. Flying under the cover of darkness and at treetop level to evade radar, at least two C-97s were lost.\\"ASN Aviation Safety Database.\\" Aviation Safety Network, Flight Safety Foundation.

They adapted Boeing 377 Stratocruiser airliners into transports, including many using C-97 tail sections including the loading ramps. Others were adapted with swiveling tails and refueling pods.

It has been criticized by some experts on nutrition and eating disorders for encouraging dieting in children as young as 8. Christy Harrison, a registered dietician, wrote in the New York Times, \\"programs like this are fertile ground for disordered eating\\" and that efforts to lose weight \\"are especially troubling when imposed on children who aren't in a position to make their own choices and who haven't had the opportunity to develop a peaceful relationship with food and their bodies.\\" However, an article in the Journal of Childhood Obesity concluded that it could be \\"part of the piece of the puzzle to improving health in youth\\", despite the authors' concerns with the marketing of the app emphasizing weight loss. An uncontrolled three-month study of the app used by children between 8 and 17 said that it was \\"highly effective\\" based on an average reduction in zBMI of 0.26, and a survey of weight management apps published in JMIR mHealth uHealth noted that of their list, only Kurbo involved health care professionals in its development.

The series originally aired on Fox and was canceled after four episodes. It was later picked up by PBS and aired in its entirety. The series was created by R. J. Cutler, a documentary filmmaker. The show received the 2001 Emmy Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction Program. The theme song \\"American High (Now It's Everything)\\", was written and performed by Bouncing Souls. An earlier Fox Network documentary series from 1991, Yearbook also covered the lives of suburban Chicago high school students. Plot Kaytee's gift for song steers an inner turmoil about her future. Morgan's sullen and needy exterior masks his true compassion. After revealing his deepest secret to his peers, what's next for Brad? Who are they? These are real teenagers who unleash their adolescent anxieties amid their triumphs in American High. At the brink of adulthood, they face some of the toughest decisions and harshest realizations of their lives during the 1999-2000 school year at a suburban Chicago high school. But these kids aren‚Äôt actors. The situations aren‚Äôt contrived. The programs are not scripted. Cameras roll and the ensuing drama is riveting and real. American High is an innovative drama series from Academy Award-nominated filmmaker R.J. Cutler (\\"The War Room,\\" \\"The Perfect Candidate\\"). Following the lives of a group of students as they deal with their personal conflicts ‚Äì both at home and at school ‚Äì from the first day of senior year through graduation, the series is culled from 10 months of documentary footage shot by Cutler and his production team, which includes some of America's leading documentary filmmakers. Also featured in the series are scenes from hundreds of hours of \\"video diaries\\" shot by the students themselves. This remarkable combination of professional footage and student-shot video provides a window into what it's like to be a teenager growing up in America today. Brimming with exuberance, hipness and stylish editing, American High boasts authenticity as well as addictive drama. \\"They trusted our crews to tell their stories truthfully and honestly,\\" says producer Cutler of the students. \\"I wanted this to be as honest as any of the best cin√©ma v√©rit√© documentaries.\\" And Cutler has succeeded, with scenes that are often brutally frank. The footage from the students‚Äô own video diaries is among the most fascinating. These scenes capture an eclectic mix of characters baring their souls as they confront conflicts with powerful emotions. Precocious Kaytee, the gifted singer/songwriter whose music fills the hallways at school and creates decision-making dilemmas for her. Easygoing and athletic Robby, whose best friend is Brad ‚Äì the first high-profile kid to announce his homosexuality, confronts the future of his shaky relationship with Sarah. Anna, whose intimidating beauty affords her everything except what she really wants ‚Äì a boyfriend. Mike (\\"Kiwi\\"), the star football kicker whose future hinges on a successful season. One of the series‚Äô most dynamic characters, rebellious Morgan, comes across as angry and needy, masking a compassionate and sensitive nature. Half a dozen other students reveal complex natures and share their innermost feelings.

It is on a bay in the middle of the Cap de Creus peninsula, near Cap de Creus cape, on the Costa Brava of the Mediterranean. It is two- and-a-quarter-hour drive from Barcelona, and thus it is accessible not only to tourists but also to people who want a second home for weekends and summers. In 2002, Cadaqu√©s had an official population of 2,612, but up to ten times as many people can live in the town during the peak of the summer tourism season. Cadaqu√©s has a special place in art history. Commanding charcoals, by local artist Eliseu Meifr√®n, of the 19th century Cadaqu√©s beleaguered by a winter tramontane, can be seen at the Cadaqu√©s museum. Fren was the first modern artist to live in Cadaqu√©s and gave the town many of his works and a marble top table on which he sketched many of its turn-of-the-century fishermen. Salvador Dal√≠ often visited Cadaqu√©s in his childhood, and later kept a home in Port Lligat, a small village on a bay next to the town. A summer holiday here in 1916, spent with the family of Ramon Pichot is seen as especially important to Dal√≠'s artistic career. Other notable artists, including Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir√≥, Marcel Duchamp, Richard Hamilton, Albert R√†fols-Casamada, Antoni Pitxot, Henri-Fran√ßois Rey, Melina Mercouri and Maurice Boitel also spent time here. Cadaqu√©s is mentioned in the story \\"Tramontana\\" by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. The interesting submarine life of this sleepy fishing village was studied for several years by phycologist Fran√ßoise Ardr√©, long before Cadaqu√©s was discovered and transformed into a tourism destination.

The village of Cadaqu√©s has its own variant or dialect of the Catalan language. One of the most notable features is that the definite articles are different from standard Catalan, namely, they are \\"sa\\" (feminine) and \\"es\\" masculine instead of the normal Catalan definite articles \\"la\\" and \\"el\\". This feature is shared with the variant of Catalan spoken in the Balearic Islands. The explanation for this (see \\"El Vocabulari de Cadaqu√©s\\", Ernesta Sala i Bruses) is that when the Catalan ruler Jaume I conquered the Balearic Islands in the Middle Ages he re-colonized the islands with people from the Empord√† region of Catalonia. Because Cadaqu√©s has remained relatively isolated from the surrounding region (owing to its geography), the mediaeval speech patterns have been preserved. Another aspect of the speech variant of Cadaqu√©s is the alteration of the first person singular of certain verbs: conjugations that normally end in \\"o\\" end in \\"i\\" in the Cadaqu√©s variant. For example, \\"a vegades agafi molt per Cala Nans\\" (informant was an approximately 90-year-old fisherman). In standard Catalan this would be \\"a vegades agafo molt per Cala Nans\\" (meaning: sometimes I catch a lot at Cala Nans) The speech variant of Catalan has most similarities with the Catalan spoken in Ibiza (Balearic Islands). The Catalan variant of Cadaqu√©s is referred to as \\"cadaquesenc\\" by the local people and also has many lexical items. Examples include: * rastell: a street (normally with a steep slope) which is formed with pieces of slate stone placed in a vertical position. These types of streets are very characteristic of the streets of Cadaqu√©s. * grop: a black rain cloud * llagut: a small boat * talaia: an elevated castle or look-out which could warn the village of danger or transmit other signals (example: approaching ships) ‚Äì compare with the \\"talaiots\\" of Menorca. * xarxi: a (fishing) net, as opposed to \\"xarxa\\" in standard Catalan * Norai: a stone cylindrical building with a large stone on the top that fishermen used to attach their boats.  Main sights  * Salvador Dal√≠ House-Museum * Church of St. Mary (late-17th century) is the church that most stands out in the views of the town. * Hermitage of Sant Sebasti√†, a large house located high on Pen√≠ Mountain behind Cadaqu√©s. It is a private residence not open to the public. The hermitage is surrounded by cork trees, and is built on a steep slope. * Natural Park of Cap de Creus. The Cadaqu√©s shoreline Panorama of Cadaqu√©s Panorama of Cadaqu√©s  Traditions  Women of the village traditionally fetched water using a glazed earthenware jug called a \\"doll\\". The colour of the glazing was green. Similar earthenware can still be seen used as decorations. A number of photos exist showing women carrying these \\"dolls\\" on their heads (covered with a protective cloth). Owing to Cadaqu√©s's proximity to the French border and its isolation by land, the village had a tradition of running contraband. See the writings of Josep Pla.  Geology  Cadaqu√©s and the surrounding peninsula known as the Cap de Creus owes its beauty in part to its complex geology. The rocks here were pushed up when the Pyrenees (or Pirineus in Catalan) were formed, and are mostly metamorphic schists which turn a golden colour in the Mediterranean sun. Add to that the weather: this is one of the wildest spots on the Costa Brava in the winter (Costa Brava means \\"wild coast\\"), so the migmatites and schists are battered and eroded by the Tramuntana wind which whips off the mountains and by a sea that appears as if it is boiling in the force 8 winds. The Cadaqu√©s migmatites formed under extreme pressure and temperatures: a partial melt. They are halfway between an igneous and metamorphic rock. The area also contains a lot of schist: a medium grade metamorphic rock that has been flattened into sheets. White blocks of pegmatite mark where molten rock was squeezed through the older metamorphics at the end of the orogeny or mountain building. The geological history has been exposed by erosion from wind and sea, and many geologists have mapped the area for this reason.  Chinese replica  In 2010, a Chinese developer, China Merchants Zhangzhou, announced its intention to build a near-exact copy of Cadaqu√©s on more than of land on Xiamen Bay in China. The replica village is projected to house some 15,000 Chinese holidaymakers. Building is reported to begin in September or October 2010.

Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue is teachable Plato, Meno, 70a. In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or rather arete, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia Plato, Meno, 80a-b. Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it Plato, Meno, 80d. Socrates challenges Meno's argument, often called \\"Meno's Paradox\\" or the \\"Learner's Paradox,\\" by introducing the theory of knowledge as recollection (anamnesis). As presented in the dialogue, the theory proposes that souls are immortal and know all things in a disembodied state; learning in the embodied is actually a process of recollecting that which the soul knew before it came into a bodyPlato, Meno, 81a-e. Socrates demonstrates recollection in action by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves Plato, Meno, 82a-86c. Subsequently, Socrates and Meno return to the question of whether virtue is teachable, employing the method of hypothesis. Near the end of the dialogue, Meno poses another famous puzzle, called \\"The Meno Problem\\" or \\"The Value Problem for Knowledge,\\" which questions why knowledge is valued more highly that true belief Plato, Meno, 97b-d. In response, Socrates provides a famous and somewhat enigmatic distinction between knowledge and true belief Plato, Meno, 98a. Characters Plato's Meno is a Socratic dialogue in which the two main speakers, Socrates and Meno (also transliterated as \\"Menon\\"), discuss human virtue: what it is, and whether or not it can be taught. Meno is visiting Athens from Thessaly with a large entourage of slaves attending him. Young, good-looking and well-born, he is a student of Gorgias, a prominent sophist whose views on virtue clearly influence that of Meno's. Early in the dialogue, Meno claims that he has held forth many times on the subject of virtue, and in front of large audiences. One of Meno's slaves also has a speaking role, as one of the features of the dialogue is Socrates' use of the slave to demonstrate his idea of anamnesis: certain knowledge is innate and \\"recollected\\" by the soul through proper inquiry. Another participant in the dialogue is Athenian politician Anytus, a prosecutor of Socrates with whom Meno is friendly. Dialogue =Introduction of virtue= The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates to tell him if virtue can be taught. Socrates says that he does not know what virtue is, and neither does anyone else he knows.Plato, Meno, 71b Meno responds that, according to Gorgias, virtue is different for different people, that what is virtuous for a man is to conduct himself in the city so that he helps his friends, injures his enemies, and takes care all the while that he personally comes to no harm. Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men‚Äîfree or slaves.Plato, Meno, 71e Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings. Socrates rejects the idea that human virtue depends on a person's sex or age. He leads Meno towards the idea that virtues are common to all people, that sophrosun√™ ('temperance', i.e. exercise of self-control) and dik√™ (aka dikaiosun√™; 'justice', i.e. refrain from harming others) are virtues even in children and old men.Plato, Meno, 73b Meno proposes to Socrates that the \\"capacity to govern men\\" may be a virtue common to all people. Socrates points out to the slaveholder that \\"governing well\\" cannot be a virtue of a slave, because then he would not be a slave.Plato, Meno, 73c‚Äìd One of the errors that Socrates points out is that Meno lists many particular virtues without defining a common feature inherent to virtues which makes them thus. Socrates remarks that Meno makes many out of one, like somebody who breaks a plate.Plato, Meno, 77a Meno proposes that virtue is the desire for good things and the power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem‚Äîmany people do not recognize evil.Plato, Meno, 77d‚Äìe The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the fact that so many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good.Plato, Meno, 78b Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many. No satisfactory definition of virtue emerges in the Meno. Socrates' comments, however, show that he considers a successful definition to be unitary, rather than a list of varieties of virtue, that it must contain all and only those terms which are genuine instances of virtue, and must not be circular.Day, Jane Mary. 1994. Plato's Meno in Focus. Routledge. p. 19. . =Meno's paradox= Meno asks Socrates:Plato, Meno (translated by B. Jowett 1871).Plato. [380 BC] 1976. Meno, translated by G. M. A. Grube. Indianapolis: Hackett. line 80d, p. 9. > And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not know? What > will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find what you want, > how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know? Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the canonical statement of the paradox:Plato. [380 BC] 1976. Meno, translated by G. M. A. Grube. Indianapolis: Hackett. line 80e: > \\"[A] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not > know; He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, there is no > need to search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to > look for.\\" =Dialogue with Meno's slave= Socrates responds to this sophistical paradox with a mythos ('narrative' or 'fiction') according to which souls are immortal and have learned everything prior to transmigrating into the human body. Since the soul has had contact with real things prior to birth, we have only to 'recollect' them when alive. Such recollection requires Socratic questioning, which according to Socrates is not teaching. Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by interrogating a slave who is ignorant of geometry. Socrates begins one of the most influential dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for inborn knowledge. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must be in order to double the area of a square with 2-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (4 feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be 3 feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss. Socrates claims that before he got hold of him the slave (who has been picked at random from Meno's entourage) might have thought he could speak \\"well and fluently\\" on the subject of a square double the size of a given square.Plato, Meno, 84c Socrates comments that this \\"numbing\\" he caused in the slave has done him no harm and has even benefited him.Plato, Meno, 84b Socrates then draws a second square figure using the diagonal of the original square. Each diagonal cuts each two foot square in half, yielding an area of two square feet. The square composed of four of the eight interior triangular areas is eight square feet, double that of the original area. He gets the slave to agree that this is twice the size of the original square and says that he has \\"spontaneously recovered\\" knowledge he knew from a past lifePlato, Meno, 85d without having been taught. Socrates is satisfied that new beliefs were \\"newly aroused\\" in the slave. After witnessing the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates that he thinks that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates agrees:Plato, Meno, 86b =Anytus= Meno now beseeches Socrates to return to the original question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, whether or not it is acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. They turn to the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none. Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises as the son of Anthemion, who earned his fortune with intelligence and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well- suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue. =True belief and knowledge= After the discussion with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno for his own thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests that they have made a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between \\"true belief\\" and \\"knowledge\\". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to \\"stay in their place\\" and must be \\"tethered\\" by what he calls aitias ('calculation of reason' or 'reasoned explanation'), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.Vlastos, Gregory. 1996. Studies in Greek Philosophy: Socrates, Plato, and Their Tradition 2. Princeton University Press. . p. 155. Whether or not Plato intends that the tethering of true beliefs with reasoned explanations must always involve anamnesis is explored in later interpretations of the text.Fine, Gail. 1992. \\"Inquiry in the 'Meno'.\\" In The Cambridge Companion to Plato, edited by R. Kraut. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . p. 221.Kahn, Charles. 2006. \\"Plato on Recollection.\\" In A Companion to Plato 37, edited by H. H. Benson. Wiley-Blackwell. . p. 122. Socrates' distinction between \\"true belief\\" and \\"knowledge\\" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\". Myles Burnyeat and others, however, have argued that the phrase aitias logismos refers to a practical working out of a solution, rather than a justification.Fine, Gail. 2004. \\"Knowledge and True Belief in the Meno.\\" Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 27(winter): 61‚Äì62, edited by D. Sedley. . Socrates concludes that, in the virtuous people of the present and the past, at least, virtue has been the result of divine inspiration, akin to the inspiration of the poets, whereas a knowledge of it will require answering the basic question, what is virtue?. In most modern readings these closing remarks are \\"evidently ironic,\\"Waterfield, Robin. 2005. Meno and Other Dialogues, (Oxford World Classics). Oxford University Press. . pxliv. but Socrates' invocation of the gods may be sincere, albeit \\"highly tentative.\\"Scott, Dominic. 2006. Plato's 'Meno'. Cambridge University Press. p 193. . This passage in the Meno is often seen as the first statement of the problem of the value of knowledge: how is knowledge more valuable than mere true belief?Pritchard, Duncan, John Turri, and J. Adam Carter. [2007] 2018. \\"The Value of Knowledge\\" (revised). The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Meno and Protagoras Meno theme is also dealt with in the dialogue Protagoras, where Plato ultimately has Socrates arrive at the opposite conclusion: virtue can be taught. Likewise, while in Protagoras knowledge is uncompromisingly this-worldly, in Meno the theory of recollection points to a link between knowledge and eternal truths.

Written and directed by Billy Ray, the film is based on a 1998 Vanity Fair article of the same name by H. G. Bissinger and chronicles Glass' fall from grace when his stories were discovered to be fabricated. It stars Hayden Christensen as Glass, alongside Peter Sarsgaard, Chlo√´ Sevigny, and Steve Zahn.Why All Journalists Should Watch Shattered Glass - Plagiarism Today The film premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film FestivalDer Spiegel Fires Journalist After Fabricated Articles ‚Äî Deadline on August 10, 2003 and received a North American limited release on November 26, 2003. Despite being a commercial failure, Shattered Glass received highly positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Christensen's and Sarsgaard's performances. Plot Stephen Glass is a reporter at The New Republic, where he has made a name for himself for writing colorful stories. His editor Michael Kelly is revered by the magazine's young staff. When David Keene (at the time Chairman of the American Conservative Union) questions Glass's description of minibars and the drunken antics of Young Republicans at a convention, Kelly backs his reporter when Glass admits to one mistake but says the rest is true. Kelly is fired after he stands up to his boss Marty Peretz on an unrelated personnel issue, and fellow writer Charles \\"Chuck\\" Lane is promoted as a replacement. The magazine publishes an entertaining story by Glass titled \\"Hack Heaven\\" about Ian Restil, a teenage hacker who was given a lucrative job at software company Jukt Micronics after hacking into its computer system. After the article is published, Forbes Digital Tool reporter Adam Penenberg begins researching the story in order to discover how Glass scooped everyone else; Penenberg is unable to uncover any corroborating evidence for Glass's story. Questioned by the Forbes reporter, Lane becomes suspicious when Glass cannot provide sources for his article and when the few pieces of concrete evidence are discovered to be an amateurish website representing Jukt Micronics and a Palo Alto phone number with only one phone line where every call goes directly to voicemail. Penenberg and his colleague Andy Fox can find no proof Jukt or any of the people mentioned in the story exist: Restil, Jukt president George Sims, former NBA agent Joe Hiert, and Nevada law enforcement official Jim Ghort. Lane drives Glass to the convention center where the hacker convention supposedly took place. When Lane asks a security guard for help, he learns the convention center was not open that day. Lane also discovers that the restaurant where the hackers supposedly ate dinner afterwards closes in the early afternoon. After haphazardly trying to defend himself, Glass finally \\"admits\\" to Lane that he wasn't actually at the hacker convention, but relied on sources for information and pretended he was there to give the article a first-person feel. Lane is outraged, but proceeds cautiously while seeking the truth. He suspends Glass, earning him the enmity of staff reporters who all are fond of Glass. Caitlin Avey is so angered by Lane's actions that she considers quitting. When a fellow staff member calls Lane, expressing concern for Glass's state of mind, he mentions that Glass has a brother living in Palo Alto. Lane realizes the brother must have posed as Sims on the day he returned Lane's phone call. Glass pleads for another chance, but Lane orders him out of the office and takes his security access card. Searching through back issues of The New Republic, Lane realizes that much of Glass's previous work was falsified. When an emotional Glass returns, Lane fires him. Caitlin accuses Lane of wanting to get rid of everyone who was loyal to Kelly, but he challenges her to act like the good reporter she is. He reminds her that half of the falsified stories were published on Kelly's watch after being fact- checked, and that the entire staff will have to apologize to their readers for allowing Glass to continue to hand in fictitious stories. The following day, a receptionist wryly remarks to Lane that all this trouble could have been averted if the stories required photographs, which Lane had argued against putting in the magazine. Lane discovers the staff has written an apology to their readers. They spontaneously applaud their editor, signifying their unity. At a meeting with Lane and a lawyer, Glass tacitly admits that 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for The New Republic were fabricated in whole or in part. An epilogue reveals that Glass decided to complete law school and wrote a novel called The Fabulist about a reporter who fabricates his stories, and that Kelly was killed in Iraq while covering Operation Iraqi Freedom. The film is dedicated to his memory.

Bissinger's Vanity Fair magazine article about Stephen Glass for an HBO original movie. They hired screenwriter Billy Ray based on the script he had written for the TNT film Legalese. Ray grew up with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as his heroes and studied journalism for a year. It was this love for journalism that motivated him to make Shattered Glass. A sudden change in management put the film into turnaround and it remained inactive for two years until Cruise/Wagner Productions bought it from HBO. They took it to Lionsgate and Ray asked the studio if he could direct in addition to writing it. The challenge for Ray was to make the subject matter watchable because, according to the filmmaker, \\"watching people write is deadly dull ... in a film like this, dialogue is what a character is willing to reveal about himself, and the camera is there to capture everything else\\". The breakthrough for Ray came when he realized that the film's real protagonist was not Glass but Chuck Lane. According to Ray, \\"as fascinating as Stephen Glass is by the end of the movie people would want to kill themselves ‚Äì you just can't follow him all the way\\". He used the Bissinger article as a starting point, which gave him a line of dialogue on which to hook the entire character of Glass: \\"Are you mad at me?\\" According to Ray, \\"you can build an entire character around that notion, and we did\\". To prepare for the film, Ray interviewed and re-interviewed key figures for any relevant details. He signed some of them as paid consultants and gave several approval over the script. Early on, he spent a considerable amount of time trying to earn the trust of the people who had worked with Glass and get them to understand that he was going to be objective with the subject matter. The real Michael Kelly was so unhappy about how he was portrayed in Bissinger's article that he threatened to sue when Ray first contacted him about the film and refused for two years to read Ray's script, which he eventually approved. Ray attempted to contact Glass through his lawyers but was unsuccessful. Lionsgate lawyers asked Ray to give them an annotated script where he had to footnote every line of dialogue and every assertion and back them up with corresponding notes. The night before principal photography began in Montreal, Ray screened All the President's Men for the cast and crew. He shot both halves of the film differently ‚Äì in the first half, he used hand-held cameras in the scenes that took place in the offices of The New Republic, but when the Forbes editors begin to question Glass, the camerawork was more stable. Ray's original cut of the film was a much more straightforward account of events but while editing the film he realized that it was not good enough. He raised additional funds to shoot the high school scenes that bookend the film. On April 3, 2003, a little more than six months before the film was released, Michael Kelly was killed while reporting on the invasion of Iraq. The film is dedicated to his memory. Release Shattered Glass premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, the Boston Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival before opening on eight screens in New York City and Los Angeles on October 31, 2003. It grossed $77,540 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $2,220,008 in North America and $724,744 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $2,944,752. =Critical reception= The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating, based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.68/10. The site's consensus states: \\"A compelling look at Stephen Glass' fall from grace.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \\"a serious, well-observed examination of the practice of journalism,\\" and \\"an astute and surprisingly gripping drama.\\" He added, \\"A more showily ambitious film might have tried to delve into Glass's personal history in search of an explanation for his behavior, or to draw provocative connections between that behavior and the cultural and political climate of the times. Such a movie would also have been conventional, facile and ultimately false. Mr. Ray knows better than to sensationalize a story about the dangers of sensationalism. Shattered Glass is good enough to be true\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and felt the film was well-cast and \\"deserves comparison with All the President's Men among movies about journalism\\". In a dissenting review from The Village Voice, J. Hoberman dismissed the film as \\"self-important yet insipid,\\" and asks, \\"Shattered Glass begs a larger question: What sort of culture elevates Glass for his entertainment value, punishes him for being too entertaining, rewards his notoriety, and then resurrects him again as a moral object lesson?\\" Sarsgaard's performance as Charles Lane was singled out by several critics for praise. USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote of him: \\"Sarsgaard deserves more credit than he'll probably get for his multi- layered performance\\". Premieres Glenn Kenny wrote, \\"it's Peter Sarsgaard, as the editor who serves Glass his just desserts [sic], who walks away with the picture, metamorphosing his character's stiffness into a moral indignation that's jolting and, finally, invigorating\\". His performance ended up winning numerous awards, including \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" citations from the Boston Society of Film Critics, Kansas City Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, San Francisco Film Critics Circle, and the Toronto Film Critics Association, as well as nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards and the Golden Globes. The A.V. Club placed his portrayal of Chuck Lane at number six on a list of the best performances of the decade. Stephen Glass saw the film and, when reflecting about the experience, he said, \\"It was very painful for me. It was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life I am most ashamed of\\".

Mellon Financial Corporation was one of the world's largest money management firms. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it was in the business of institutional and high-net-worth individual asset management, including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, business banking, and shareholder and investor services. On December 4, 2006, it announced a merger agreement with Bank of New York, to form The Bank of New York Mellon. After regulatory and shareholder approval, the banks completed the merger on July 2, 2007.  History  Mellon was founded in 1869 by Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon, as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank. In 1902, the institution became Mellon National Bank. Mellon Bank was an important force in the mass production revolution in the United States, especially in the Midwest. The Mellon family using the bank as a proxy had direct involvement with founding the modern aluminium, oil, consumer electronics and financial industries. Alcoa, Gulf Oil (now Chevron-Texaco), Westinghouse (now CBS Corporation and Siemens) and Rockwell, all were directly founded and managed by the bank. U.S. Steel (the world's first billion dollar corporation), Heinz, General Motors, Koppers and ExxonMobil (as Rockefeller's Standard Oil) were born and nurtured by Mellon. In 1920, Andrew left his leadership post of the bank to become the longest serving U.S. Treasury Secretary in history (serving under three separate administrations). In 1929, Richard founded Mellbank Corporation. In 1946, Mellon National, Mellbank, and the Union Trust Company merged to form Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. A reorganization in 1972 brought about a name change to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation. In 1983, Mellon bought Girard Bank of Philadelphia and Central Counties Bank of State College, Pennsylvania. The next year, Mellon National Corporation became Mellon Bank Corporation, and purchased Northwest Pennsylvania Corporation of Oil City, Pennsylvania. In 1986, Mellon bought Commonwealth National Financial of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is also reported that Mellon operated the 2nd largest financial computing system in the world. In 1991, Mellon bought United Penn Bank of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The next year, Mellon bought 54 branch offices of Philadelphia- based Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, whose parent company had become insolvent. Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, was the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819. The Boston Company logo, ca 1993, acquired by Mellon In 1993, Mellon bought The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The next year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella. 1998 saw Mellon's purchase of United Bankshares, Inc., of Miami, 1st Business Bank of Los Angeles, and Founders Asset Management. In 1999, Martin G. McGuinn became chairman and chief executive officer of Mellon Bank Corporation. Mellon Bank Corporation then became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it sold its retail banking operations to Citizens Financial Group. In 2004, Mellon announced it would purchase Safeco Trust Company from Seattle-based Safeco Corporation. The same year, it purchased outstanding shares in London-based Pareto Partners and offered them floor space in Mellon Financial Centre (opened earlier in the year). In February 2020, Mellon announced that it has successfully onboarded Liontrust Asset Management to its new Investment Operations platform. Merger with Bank of New York In 2006, Mellon announced its plans to merge with Bank of New York. Talks began when Tom Renyi approached Robert Kelly about a possible amalgamation between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation. The $16.5 billion deal ($ billion today) was announced in December 2006 and finalized on July 1, 2007, with Kelly as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the new company, and Renyi as Executive Chairman. Per the deal, the new Board of Directors is composed of ten directors appointed by the Bank of New York, and eight by Mellon. The merger was completed July 1, 2007, as The Bank of New York Mellon. Headquartered in New York, it is the world's largest securities servicing firm and one of the world's top ten asset managing firms. The new venture launched its brand identity on October 1, 2007. These two companies, along with State Street, followed essentially the same evolution. All were originally large diversified financial service providers, particularly in the corporate banking space in the regions they were located in. However, competition in the corporate loans and retail banking businesses saw them jettison these operations in favor of what were believed to be more stable, fee based business: asset management (i.e. investment management in the form of mutual funds and other separately managed accounts) and asset servicing (i.e. corporate trust, stock transfer services and depository receipts). Mellon is a large provider of what are known as controlled disbursement accounts. These are checking accounts in specialized locations which are given early warning by the Federal Reserve as to what checks will be clearing them. Companies can then transfer the exact amount needed to pay those checks, while then investing the unneeded money or using other funds to pay down debt. Mellon Bank CEOs * Robert E.

It incorporates 21st-century information and communications technology to promote democracy; such technologies include civic technology and government technology. It is a form of government in which all adult citizens are presumed to be eligible to participate equally in the proposal, development and creation of laws. E-democracy encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self- determination. According to Sharique Hassan Manazir, digital inclusion is an inherent necessity of an e-democracy. Goals =Human rights= The spread of free information through the internet has encouraged freedom and human development. The internet is used for promoting human rights‚Äîincluding free speech, religion, expression, peaceful assembly, government accountability, and the right of knowledge and understanding‚Äîthat support democracy. An e-democracy process has been recently proposed in a scientific article for solving a question that has crucial importance for all humans in the 21st century: \\"As planet Earth citizens, will you stop the climate from warming?\\" The author proposes to use a cell-phone for answering this question during the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang 2018 and Tokyo 2020. =Expanding democracy= The Internet has several attributes that encourage thinking about it as a democratic medium. The lack of centralized control makes censorship difficult. There are other parallels in the social design in the early days of the internet, such as the strongly libertarian support for free speech, the sharing culture that permeated nearly all aspects of Internet use, and the outright prohibition on commercial use by the National Science Foundation. Another example is the unmediated mass communication on the internet, such as through newsgroups, chat rooms, and MUDs. This communication ignored the boundaries established with broadcast media, such as newspapers or radio, and with one-to-one media, such as letters or landline telephones. Finally, because the Internet is a massive digital network with open standards, universal and inexpensive access to a wide variety of communication media and models could actually be attained.Novak, T., & Hoffman, D. (1998). Bridging the Digital Divide: The Impact of Race on Computer Access and Internet Use. Nashville: Vanderbilt University. Some practical issues involving e-democracy include: effective participation; voting equality at decision stage; enlightened understanding; control of the agenda; and inclusiveness. Systemic issues may include cyber-security concerns and protection of sensitive data from third parties. =Improving Democracy= Modern democracies are generally representative democracies, where citizens elect representatives to manage the creation and implementation of laws, policies, and regulations on their behalf, in contrast to direct democracies in which citizens retain that responsibility. They may be referred to as more or less \\"democratic\\" depending on how well the government represents the will or interest of the people. A shift to e-democracy would in effect devolve political power from elected representatives to the individual. In America, politics have become reliant on the Internet because the Internet is the primary source of information for most Americans. The Internet educates people on democracy, helping people stay up to date with what is happening in their government. Online advertising is becoming more popular for political candidates and group's opinions on propositions. For many the Internet is often the primary resource for information. The reason for this, and especially among younger voters, is that it is easy and reliable when used correctly, thus lowering an individual's workload. The innate usability of search engines, such as Google, results in increased citizen engagement with research and political issues. Social networks allow people to express their opinions about the government through an alias, anonymously and judgment-free.Oral, Beh√ßet(2008). \\"Computers & Education: The evaluation of the student teachers' attitudes toward the Internet and democracy.\\" Dicle University, Volume 50, Issue 1: 437-445. Due to the Internets' size and decentralized structure, any individual has the potential to go viral and gain influence over a large number of others. The Internet enables citizens to get and post information about politicians, and it allows those politicians to get advice from the people in larger numbers. This collective decision making and problem-solving gives more power to the citizens and helps politicians make decisions faster. This creates a more productive society that can handle problems faster and more efficiently. Getting feedback and advice from the American population is a large part of a politician's job and the Internet allows them to function effectively with larger numbers of people's opinions. With this heightened ability to communicate with the public, the American government is able to function more capably and effectively as a Democracy. The American election of 2016 is an example, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made good use of Twitter, attempting to shape perceptions on their behalf, whilst using social media to transmit the idea that authorities are also 'normal', and they can communicate through a Twitter account just like everyone does. In other words, nowadays, any ordinary person can research on political causes and events at any time just by searching something on Google. Also, the various different forms of sharing one's political beliefs through interactive chats and online posts on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, connects people who part one's same views (Sarwar & Soomro, 2013, pp. 216‚Äì226) Generation X became disillusioned that even large-scale public protests such as the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985) were seen to fail a decade before information technology became generally available to individual citizens. E-democracy is sometimes seen as a remedy to the insular nature, concentrated power, and lack of post- election accountability in traditional democratic process organized mostly around political parties. Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party, said: > It feels like the Labour frontbench is further away from our members than at > any point in our history and the digital revolution can help bring the party > closer together ... I'm going to ask our NEC to see whether we can have > digital branches and digital delegates to the conference. Not replacing what > we do but providing an alternative platform. It's a way of organising for a > different generation of people who do their politics differently, get their > news differently. =Digital Inclusion= Digital Inclusion is essential for citizen participation in public policy formulation for a healthy Digital Democracy through equal participation of all section of society in any democracy irrespective of citizen's income level, education level, gender, religion, color, race, language used, physical and mental health etc. Any public policy formulated without including any specific section of society will always remain non-inclusive by nature which will go against the ethos of democracy. Effects \\"E-democracy offers greater electronic community access to political processes and policy choices. E-democracy development is connected to complex internal factors, such as political norms and citizen pressures\\" and in general to the particular model of democracy implemented. E-democracy is therefore highly influenced by both internal factors to a country and by the external factors of standard innovation and diffusion theory. People are pressuring their public officials to adopt more policies that other states or countries have regarding information and news about their government online. People have all governmental information at their fingertips and easy access to contact their government officials. In this new generation where internet and networking rule everyone's daily lives, it is more convenient that people can be informed of the government and policies through this form of communication. E-democracy has, in fact, endorsed a better and faster political information exchange, public argumentation and involvement in decision-making (Djik, 2006, pp. 126). Social media has become an empowerment tool, especially for the youth, who are encouraged to participate in elections. Social media has also allowed the politicians to interact with civilians. A clear example was the 2016 American elections and how Donald Trump tweeted most of his announcements and goals. Not only Trump, but other presidents have Twitter accounts such as Justin Trudeau, Jair Bolsonaro, and Hassan Rouhani. Moreover, some people genuinely believe that the government posting public information online makes them more vulnerable and therefore more evident in people's eyes, which favors the public's surveillance. Thus, distributing power among society. In Jane Fountain's (2001) Building the Virtual State, she describes how this widespread e-democracy is able to connect with so many people and correlates it to the government we had before. > Fountain's framework provides a subtle and nuanced appreciation of the > interplay of preexisting norms, procedures, and rules within bureaucracies > and how these affect the introduction of new technological forms... In its > most radical guise, this form of e- government would entail a radical > overhaul of the modern administrative state as regular electronic > consultations involving elected politicians, civil servants, pressure > groups, and other affected interests become standard practice in all stages > of the policy process (Sage). Cities in states with Republican-controlled legislatures, high legislative professionalization, and more active professional networks were more likely to embrace e-government and e-democracy. =Occupy movement= Following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 a number of social networks proposed demonstrations such as the Occupy movement. =15-M movement= The 15-M Movement started in Spain and spread to other European countries. From that emerged the Partido X (X Party) proposals in Spain. =Arab Spring= During the \\"Arab Spring,\\" online activists led uprisings in a dozen countries across North Africa and the Middle East. At first, digital media allowed pro- democracy movements to use the internet against authoritarian regimes; however, these regimes eventually worked social media into their own counter- insurgency strategies. Digital media helped to turn individualized, localized, and community-specific dissent into structured movements with a collective consciousness about both shared grievances and opportunities for action.\\"The Role of Digital Media\\", Philip N. Howard, Muzammil M. Hussain. Journal of Democracy, Volume 22, Number 3, July 2011.pp. 35-48 10.1353/jod.2011.0041 (Abstract) Egyptian Revolution On 25 January 2011, mass protests began in Cairo, Egypt, protesting the long reign of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the high unemployment rate, government corruption, poverty, and oppression within society. This 18-day revolution did not begin with guns, violence, or protests, but rather with the creation of a single Facebook page which quickly gained the attention of thousands, and soon millions, of Egyptians, spreading into a global phenomenon. The internet empowered protesters and allowed for anyone with access to the internet be involved in the democratization process of their government. In order to have a democratic, free nation, all information that can be shared, should be shared. Protestors communicated, organized, and collaborated through the use of this technology with real time, real impacts. Technologies played an enormous role on the world stage during this time. Even when the regime eliminated all access to the Internet in a failed attempt to halt further political online forums, Google and Twitter teamed up, making a system that would get information out to the public without having access to the internet. The interactivity of media during this revolution boosted civic participation and played a monumental role in the political outcome of the revolution and the democratization of an entire nation. The revolution in Egypt has been understood by some as an example of a broader trend of transforming from a system based on group control to one of \\"networked individualism\\". These networked societies are constructed post -\\"triple revolution\\" of technology, which involves a three-step process. Step one in the \\"triple revolution\\" is \\"the turn to social networks\\", step two: \\"the proliferation of the far-flung, instantaneous internet\\", and step three: \\"the even wider proliferation of always-available mobile phones\\". These elements play a key role in change through the Internet. Such technologies provide an alternative sphere that is unregulated by the government, and where construction of ideas and protests can foster without regulation. For example, In Egypt, the \\"6 April Youth Movement\\" established their political group on Facebook where they called for a national strike to occur on 6 April. This event was ultimately suppressed, however; the Facebook group remained, spurring the growth of other activist parties to take an online media route. The Internet in Egypt was used also to form connections with networks of people outside of their own country. The connections provided through Internet media sources, such as Twitter allowed rapid spread of the revolt to be known around the world. Specifically, more than 3 million tweets contained six popular hashtags alluring to the revolt, for example, #Egypt and #sidibouzid; further enabling the spread of knowledge and change in Egypt. =Kony 2012= The Invisible Children's Kony 2012 video was released 5 March 2012, initiating an online grassroots campaign for the search and arrest of Joseph Kony. Invisible Children, the non-profit organization responsible for this video campaign, was founded on the mission to bring awareness to the vile actions of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), located in Central Africa, and the arrest of its leader, Joseph Kony. In the video, Jason Russell, one of the founders of Invisible Children, says that \\"the problem is that 99% of the planet doesn't know who [Kony] is\\" and the only way to stop him is by having enough support from the people to convince the government to continue the hunt for him. So, Invisible Children's purpose for the video was to raise awareness by making Kony famous through the ever- expanding market of social media and to use the technology we have today to bring his crimes to light. On 21 March 2012, a group of 33 Senators introduced a resolution condemning \\"the crimes against humanity\\" committed by Joseph Kony and the LRA. The resolution supports the continued efforts by the US government to \\"strengthen the capabilities of regional military forces deployed to protect civilians and pursue commanders of the LRA, and calls for cross-border efforts to increase civilian protection and provide assistance to populations affected by the LRA.\\" Senator Lindsey Graham, a co-sponsor of the resolution stated that \\"When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined\\". =India Against Corruption 2011-12= India Against Corruption (IAC) is an anti-corruption movement in India which was particularly prominent during the anti-corruption protests of 2011 and 2012, the central point of which was debate concerning the introduction of a Jan Lokpal bill. During that time it sought to mobilize the masses in support of their demands for a less corrupt society in India. Divisions amongst key members of the IAC's core committee eventually led to a split within the movement. Arvind Kejriwal left to form the Aam Aadmi Party, while Anna Hazare left to form Jantantra Morcha. =Long March (Pakistan)= In December 2012, after living for seven years in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Qadri returned to Pakistan and initiated a political campaign. Qadri called for a \\"million-men\\" march in Islamabad to protest against the government's corruption. On 14 January 2013, a crowd marched down the city's main avenue. Thousands of people pledged to sit-in until their demands were met. When he started the long march from Lahore about 25,000 people were with him. He told the rally in front of parliament: \\"There is no Parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits [bandits] ... Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers.\\". After four days of sit-in, the Government and Qadri signed an agreement called the Islamabad Long March Declaration, which promised electoral reforms and increased political transparency. Although Qadri called for a \\"million-men\\" march, the estimated total present for the sit-in in Islamabad was 50,000 according to the government. =Five Star Movement (Italy)= In 2012, the rising Five Star Movement (M5S), in Italy, chose its candidates to Italian and European elections through online voting by registered members of Beppe Grillo's blog. Through an application called Rousseau reachable on the web, the registered users of M5S discuss, approve or reject legislative proposals (submitted then in the Parliament by the M5S group). For example, the M5S electoral law was shaped through a series of online votes, like the name of the M5S candidate for President of the Republic in Italy. The choice to support the abolition of a law against immigrants was taken online by members of the M5S even if the final decision was against the opinions of Grillo and Casaleggio. The partnership with the UK Independence Party was also decided by online voting, although the given options for the choice of European Parliament group for M5S were limited to Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and \\"Stay independent\\" (Non-Inscrits). The option of joining the Greens/EFA group was discussed, but this option was not available at the time of the voting due to that group's prior rejection of the M5S. When the Conte I Cabinet broke down, a new coalition between Democratic Party and MS5 was approved after 100,000 members voted, with 79.3% approving the new coalition. Requirements E-Democracy is made possible through its role in relevancy of participation, the social construction of inclusiveness, sensitivity to the individual, and flexibility in participation. The Internet provides a sense of relevancy in participation through allowing everyone's voice to be heard and expressed. A structure of social inclusion is also provided through a wide variety of Internet sites, groups, and social networks, all representing different viewpoints and ideas. Sensitivity to the individual's needs is accomplished through the ability to express individual opinions publicly and rapidly. Finally, the Internet is an extremely flexible area of participation; it is low in cost and widely available to the public. Through these four directions, e-Democracy and the implementation of the Internet are able to play an active role in societal change. =Internet access= The e-democratic process is hindered by the digital divide between active participants and those who do not participate in electronic communities. Advocates of e-democracy may advocate government moves to close this gap. The disparity e-governance and e-democracy between developed and developing worlds has been attributed to the digital divide. Practical objections include the digital divide between those with access and those without, as well as the opportunity cost of expenditure on e-democracy innovations. There is also skepticism of the amount of impact that they can make through online participation. =Security and the protection of privacy= The government must be in a position to guarantee that online communications are secure and that they do not violate people's privacy. This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent ballot rigging or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. Electronic voting in Estonia is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems. =Government responsiveness= In order to attract people to get involved in online consultations and discussions, the government must respond to people and actively demonstrate that there is a relationship between the citizen's engagement and policy outcome. It is also important that people are able to become involved in the process, at a time and place that is convenient to them but when their opinions will count. The government will need to ensure that the structures are in place to deal with increased participation. In order to ensure that issues are debated in a democratic, inclusive, tolerant and productive way, the role that intermediaries and representative organizations may play should be considered. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing legal rights of access to information held by public authorities, citizens should have the right to effective public deliberation and moderation.Waller Livesey Edin (2001) Types of interaction 3D e-democracy roadmap: transcending the trade-offs E-democracy has the potential to overcome the traditional trade-off between the size of the group that participates in the democratic process and the depth of the will expression (see Figure). Traditionally, large group size was achieved with simple ballot voting, whereas the depth of the will expression was limited to predefined options (what's on the ballot), while depth of will expression was achieved by limiting the number of participants through representative democracy (see Table). The social media Web 2.0 revolution has shown to achieve both, large group sizes and depth of will expression, but the will expressions in social media are not structured and it is difficult (and often subjective) to make sense of them (see Table). New information processing techniques, including big data analytics and the semantic web have shown ways to make use of these possibilities for the implementation of future forms of e-democracy. For now, the process of e-democracy is carried out by technologies such as electronic mailing lists, peer-to-peer networks, collaborative software and apps like GovernEye, Countable, VoteSpotter, wikis, Internet forums and blogs. Forms of democracy trade-off table E-democracy has been analyzed with regard to the different stages of the democratic process, such as \\"information provision, deliberation, and participation in decision-making.\\", by the hierarchical level of government, including local communities, states/regions, nations and on the global stage and by its reach and scope of involvement, such as the involvement of citizens/voters, the media, elected officials, political organizations, and governments.Clift, S. (2004). E-Democracy Resource Links from Steven Clift - E-Government, E-Politics, E-Voting Links and more. Retrieved 10 July 2009, from Publicus.Ne-t Public Strategies for the Online World: Publicus.net As such, \\"its development is conditioned by such pervasive changes as increased interdependency, technological multimediation, partnership governance, and individualism.\\" Social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, WordPress and Blogspot, are playing an increasingly important role in democratic deliberations.Is Facebook keeping you in a political bubble? http://news.sciencemag.org/social-sciences/2015/05/facebook- keeping-you-political-bubble The role of social media in e-democracy has been an emerging area for e-democracy, as well as related technological developments, such as argument maps and eventually, the semantic web. free access to the article can be found here martinhilbert.net/e-democracyHilbertJITP.pdf Another related development consists in combining the open communication of social networking with the structured communication of closed panels including experts and/or policy- makers, such as for example through modified versions of the Delphi method (HyperDelphi) to combine the open communication of self-organized virtual communities with the structured communication of closed panels, including members of the policy-community.. A summary of Democrazia elettronica is also in , chap. 23. This approach addresses the question of how, in electronic democracy, to reconcile distributed knowledge and self-organized memories with critical control, responsibility and decision. The social networking entry point, for example, is within the citizens' environment, and the engagement is on the citizens' terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networks as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples of state usage can be found at The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage, where citizens can find Google tools and open social forums. Those are seen as important stepping stones in the maturation of the concept of e-democracy. =Civic engagement= Civic engagement includes three dimensions: political knowledge of public affairs, political trust for the political system, and political participation in influencing the government and the decision-making process. The internet aids civic engagement by providing a new avenue to interact with governmental institutions. Proponents of e-democracy believe that governments can be much more actively engaged than presently, and encourage citizens to take their own initiative to influence decisions that will affect them. Many studies report increasing use of the internet to find political information. Between 1996 and 2002, the number of adults who reported that the internet was significant in their choices increased from about 14 to 20 percent. In 2002, nearly a quarter of the population reported having visited a website to research specific public policy issues. Studies have shown that more people visit websites that challenge their point of view than visit websites that mirror their own opinions. Sixteen percent of the population has participated in online political culture by interacting with political websites through joining campaigns, volunteering time, donating money, or participating in polls. According to a survey conducted by Philip N. Howard, almost two-thirds of the adult population in the United States has had some online experience with political news, information, or other content over the past four election cycles. They tend to reference the websites of special interest groups more than the websites of specific elected leaders, political candidates, political parties, nonpartisan groups, and local community groups. The information capacity available on the Internet allows citizens to become more knowledgeable about government and political issues, and the interactivity of the medium allows for new forms of communication with government, i.e. elected officials and/or public servants. The posting of contact information, legislation, agendas, and policies makes government more transparent, potentially enabling more informed participation both online and offline. According to Matt Leighninger, the internet impacts government in two main ways, empowering individuals, and empowering groups of people. The internet gives interested citizens better access to the information which allows them to impact on public policy. Using online tools to organize, people can more easily be involved in the policy-making process of government, and this has led to increased public engagement. Social media sites support networks of people; online networks affect the political process, including causing an increase in politicians' efforts to appeal to the public in campaigns. For e-democracy provides a forum for public discussion. An e-government process improves cooperation with the local populace and helps the government focus in upon key issues the community wants addressed. The theory is that every citizen has the opportunity to have a voice in their local government. E-democracy works in tandem with local communities and gives every citizen who wants to contribute the chance. What makes an effective e-democracy is that the citizens not only contribute to the government, but they communicate and work together to improve their own local communities. E-democracy is the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support the democratic decision-making processes. ICTs play a major role in organizing and informing citizens in various forms of civic engagement. ICTs are used to enhance active participation of citizens and to support the collaboration between actors for policy-making purposes within the political processes of all stages of governance.Kubicek, H., & Westholm, H. (2007).Macintoch, Ann (2006) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development lists three main factors when it comes to ICTs promoting civic engagement. The first of these is timing; most of the civil engagement occurs during the agenda-setting in a cycle. The second key factor is tailor; this refers to the idea of how ICTs are changing in order to allow for more civic engagement. The last of these factors is integrations; integration is how new ICTs are combining the new technological ways with the traditional ways in order to gain more civic engagement. ICT creates the opportunity for a government that is simultaneously more democratic and more expert by creating open online collaboration between professionals and the general public. The responsibility of gathering information and making decisions is shared between those with technological expertise and those who are professionally considered the decision-makers. Greater public participation in the collaboration of ideas and policies makes decision-making is more democratic. ICT also promotes the idea of pluralism within a democracy, bringing new issues and perspectives. Regular citizens become potential producers of political value and commentary, for example, by creating individual blogs and websites. The online political sphere can work together, like ABCNews did with their Campaign Watchdog effort, where citizens by the polls reported any rule violations perpetrated by any candidate's party. Pdf. In 2000, Candidate's for the United States presidential race frequently used their websites to encourage their voters to not only vote, but to encourage their friends to vote as well. This two-step process, encouraging an individual to vote and to tell his or her friends to vote, was just emerging at that time. Now, political involvement from a variety of social media is commonplace and civic engagement through online forums frequent. Through the use of ICTs, politically minded individuals have the opportunity to become more involved. =Youth engagement= Young people under the age of 35, or Generation X and Generation Y, have been noted for their lack of political interest and activity.Owen, D. (2006). The Internet and youth civic engagement in the United States. In S. Oates, D. Owen & R. K. Gibson (Eds.), The Internet and politics: Citizens, voters and activists. London: Routledge. Electronic democracy has been suggested as a possible method to increase voter turnout, democratic participation, and political knowledge in youth.Canadian Parties in Transition, 3rd Edition. Gagnon and Tanguay (eds). Chapter 20 - Essay by Milner The notion of youth e-citizenship seems to be caught between two distinct approaches: management and autonomy. The policy of \\"targeting\\" young people so that they can \\"play their part\\" can be read either as an encouragement of youth activism or an attempt to manage it.Coleman, Stephen. \\"Doing IT for Themselves: Management versus Autonomy in Youth E-Citizenship.\\" Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008. 189‚Äì206. Autonomous e-citizens argue that despite their limited experience, youth deserve to speak for themselves on agendas of their own making. On the contrary, managed e-citizens regard young people as apprentice citizens who are in a process of transition from the immaturity of childhood to the self-possession of adulthood, and are thus incapable of contributing to politics without regulation. The Internet is another important issue, with managed e-citizens believing young people are highly vulnerable to misinformation and misdirection. The conflict between the two faces of e-citizenship is a view of democracy as an established and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to engage, and democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realized through networks in which young people engage with one another. Ultimately, strategies of accessing and influencing power are at the heart of what might first appear to be mere differences of communication styles. The Highland Youth Voice demonstrated the attempt to increase democratic involvement, especially through online measures, in Scotland. The youth population is increasingly more prominent in governmental policy and issues in the UK. However, involvement and interest have been decreasing. In 2001 elections in the United Kingdom to Westminster, the turnout of 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated at only 40%, which can be compared to the more than 80% of 16- to 24-year-old who have accessed the internet at some time in their life. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child have promoted and stressed the need to educate the younger population as citizens of the nation in which they live in, and promote the participation and active politics which they can shape through debate and communication. The Highland Youth Voice aims to increase the involvement of the younger generation through understanding their needs and wishes for their government, through an understanding of their views, experiences, and aspirations. Highland Youth Voice gives young Scots a chance to influence the decision makers in the Highlands. The members age from 14 to 18 and the parliament as a whole is an elected body of around 100 members. They are elected directly through schools and youth forums. Through the website, those involved are able to discuss the issues important to them. The final prominent democratic aspect of the website is the elections for members, which occur every other year. These three contents of the website allow for an online forum in which members may educate themselves through Youth Voice, partake in online policy debates, or experience a model of e-democracy in the ease of online voting. =Civil society= Citizens' associations play an important role in the democratic process, providing a place for individuals to learn about public affairs and a source of power outside that of the state, according to theorists like Alexis de Tocqueville. Public policy researcher Hans Klein at the Georgia Institute of Technology notes that participation in such forums has a number of barriers, such as the need to meet in one place at one time. In a study of a civic association in the northeastern United States, Klein found that electronic communications greatly enhanced the ability of the organization to fulfill its mission. The lower cost of information exchange on the Internet, as well as the high level of reach that the content potentially has, makes the Internet an attractive medium for political information, particularly amongst social interest groups and parties with lower budgets. For example, environmental or social issue groups may find the Internet an easier mechanism to increase awareness of their issues, as compared to traditional media outlets, such as television or newspapers, which require heavy financial investment. Due to all these factors, the Internet has the potential to take over certain traditional media of political communication, such as the telephone, the television, newspapers and the radio. The civil society has gradually moved into the online world. There are many forms of association in civic society. The term interest group conventionally refers to more formal organizations that either focus on particular social groups and economic sectors, such as trade unions and business and professional associations, or on more specific issues, such as abortion, gun control, or the environment.Norris, P. (2001). Digital divide: Civic engagement, information poverty, and the Internet worldwide. Cambridge: University Press Other traditional interest groups have well-established organizational structures and formal membership rules, and their primary orientation is toward influencing government and the policy process. Transnational advocacy networks bring together loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders. Novel tools are being developed that are aimed at empowering bloggers, webmasters and owners of other social media, with the effect of moving from a strictly informational use of the Internet to using the Internet as a means of social organization not requiring top-down action. Calls to action, for instance, are a novel concept designed to allow webmasters to mobilize their viewers into action without the need for leadership. These tools are also utilized worldwide: for example, India is developing an effective blogosphere that allows internet users to state their thoughts and opinions.The road to e-democracy. (2008, February). The Economist, 386(8567), 15. The Internet may serve multiple functions for all these organizations, including lobbying elected representatives, public officials, and policy elites; networking with related associations and organizations; mobilizing organizers, activists, and members using action alerts, newsletters, and emails; raising funds and recruiting supporters; and communicating their message to the public via the traditional news media. =Deliberative democracy= The Internet also plays a central role in deliberative democracy, where deliberation and access to multiple viewpoints is central in decision-making. The Internet is able to provide an opportunity for interaction and serves as a prerequisite in the deliberative process as a research tool. On the Internet, the exchange of ideas is widely encouraged through a vast number of websites, blogs, and social networking outlets, such as Twitter; all of which encourage freedom of expression. Through the Internet, information is easily accessible, and in a cost-effective manner, providing access and means for change. Another fundamental feature of the Internet is its uncontrolled nature, and ability to provide all viewpoints no matter the accuracy. The freedom the Internet provides is able to foster and advocate change, crucial in e-democracy. A recent advancement in the utilization of e-democracy for the deliberative process is the California Report Card created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at University of California, Berkeley, together with Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. The California Report Card, launched in January 2014, is a mobile-optimized web application designed to facilitate online deliberative democracy. After a short opinion poll on 6 timely issues, participants are invited to enter an online \\"caf√©\\" where they are placed, using Principal Component Analysis, among users with similar views. They are then encouraged to engage in the deliberative process by entering textual suggestions about new political issues and grading other participants' suggestions. The California Report Card prides itself on being resistant to private agendas dominating the discussion. Another example is openforum.com.au, an Australian non-profit eDemocracy project that invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate. An alternative to the SOPA and PIPA, the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN Act) is supported by Google and Facebook. The OPEN Act website Keep The Web Open provides full access to the bill. The site also incorporates user input, over 150 changes have been made by users. The peer-to-patent project allows the public to do research and present the patent examiner with 'prior art' publications which will inform them of the novelty of the invention so that they can determine whether the invention is worthy of a patent. The community elects ten prior art pieces to be sent to the patent examiner for review. This enables the public to directly communicate with the patent examiner. This form of e-democracy is a structured environment which demands certain information from participants that aid in the decision-making process. The goal of the project is to make decision-making process is made more effective by allowing experts and civilians who work together to find solutions. Beyond citizens checking a box that reduces opinions to a few given words, citizens can participate and share ideas. =Voting and polling= Another great hurdle in implementing e-democracy is the matter of ensuring security in internet-voting systems. Viruses and malware could block or redirect citizens' votes on matters of great importance; as long as that threat remains, e-democracy will not be able to diffuse throughout society. Kevin Curran and Eric Nichols of the Internet Technologies Research Group noted in 2005 that \\"a secure Internet voting system is theoretically possible, but it would be the first secure networked application ever created in the history of computers\\". A lack of participation in democracy may result from a plethora of polls and surveys, which can lead to survey fatigue. =Government transparency and accessibility= Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Some government representatives are also beginning to use Twitter which provides them with an easy medium to inform their followers. In the state of Rhode Island, for instance, Treasurer Frank T. Caprio is offering daily tweets of the state's cash flow. A number of non-governmental sites have developed cross-jurisdiction, customer-focused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a system that brings consistency to data across many dissimilar providers. It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to expend tax dollars to get it. One example of this is transparent.gov.com, a free resource for citizens to quickly identify the various open government initiatives taking place in their community or in communities across the country. A similar example is USA.gov, the official site of the United States government, which is a directory that links to every federal and state agency. E-democracy leads to a more simplified process and access to government information for public-sector agencies and citizens. For example, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings. Indiana became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. The internet has created increased government accessibility to news, policies, and contacts in the 21st century: \\"In 2000 only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online; in 2007 that figure was 58 percent. In 2000, 78 percent of the states offered no on-line services; in 2007 only 14 percent were without these services (West, 2007)\\"(Issuu). Direct access via email has also increased; \\"In 2007, 89 percent of government sites allowed the public e-mail a public official directly rather than simply e-mailing the webmaster (West, 2007)\\"(Issuu). Opposition Information and communications technologies can be used for both democratic and anti-democratic ends.(e.g. both coercive control and participation can be fostered by digital technology) George Orwell's in his Nineteen Eighty-Four is one example of the vision of the anti-democratic use of technology. Objections to direct democracy are argued to apply to e-democracy, such as the potential for direct governance to tend towards the polarization of opinions, populism, and demagoguery. =Internet censorship= In a nation with heavy government censorship, e-democracy could not be utilized to its full extent. Governments often implement internet crackdowns during widespread political protests. In the middle-east in 2011, for example, the multiple cases of internet blackouts were dubbed the \\"Arab Net Crackdown\\". Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen are all countries whose leaders implemented complete censorship of the internet in response to the plethora of pro-democracy demonstrations in their respective nations. These lockdowns were primarily put in place in order to prevent the leakage of cell phone videos that contained images of the violent government crackdown on protesters. Additionally, based on Joshua A. Tucker's critics of e-democracy, social media's malleability and receptiveness may allow political parties to manipulate it and implement political desires (Tucker et al., 2017). Through it, authorities are able to spread authoritarianism, firstly by, intimidation; imposing fear on opposers, monitoring private conversations and even imprisoning one who dissents non- desirable opinion. Secondly, flooding; diverting and occupying services with pro-regime messages. Thirdly, detaining; interrupting signals which impedes access to information. Lastly, banning; forbidding globalized platforms and websites (Tucker et al., 2017). =Concerns with populism= In a study conducted that interviewed elected officials in Austria's parliament, opinions were widely and strongly against e-democracy. They believed that the citizens were uninformed and that their only way of expressing their opinions should be to vote; sharing opinions and ideas was strictly the job of the elected. Alternatively, theories of epistemic democracy have indicated that more engagement of the populace has benefited the aggregation of knowledge and intelligence, and thus permitted democracies to track the truth better. =Stop Online Piracy Act= Many Internet users believed that Internet democracy was being attacked in the United States with the introduction of H.R. 3261, Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), in the United States House of Representatives.Smith, Congressman Lamar. \\"H.R. 3261.\\" Ed. Representatives, House of. Washington, DC: 112th Congress, 1st Session, 2011. Print. A Huffington Post Contributor noted that the best way to promote democracy, including keeping freedom of speech alive, is through defeating the Stop Online Piracy Act. It is important to note that SOPA was postponed indefinitely after major protests arose, including by many popular websites such as Wikipedia, which launched a site blackout on 18 January 2012. In India, a similar situation was noted at the end of 2011, when India's Communication and IT Minister Kapil Sibal suggested that offensive content may be privately \\"pre-screened\\" before being allowed on the Internet with no rules for redressal. However, more recent news reports quote Sibal as saying that there would be no restrictions whatsoever on the use of the Internet. Government models =Representative democracy= The radical shift from representative government to internet-mediated direct democracy is not likely. However, proponents believe that a \\"hybrid model\\" that uses the internet to allow for greater government transparency and community participation in decision-making is on the horizon. Committee selection, local town and city decisions, and otherwise people-centric decisions would be more easily facilitated. The principles of democracy are not changing so much as the tools used to uphold them. E-democracy would not be a means to implement direct democracy, but rather a tool to enable more participatory democracy as it exists now. =Electronic direct democracy= Proponents of e-democracy sometimes envision a transition from a representative democracy to a direct democracy carried out through technological means, and see this transition as an end goal of e-democracy. In an Electronic direct democracy (EDD) (also known as open source governance or collaborative e-democracy), the people are directly involved in the legislative function by electronic means. Citizens electronically vote on legislation, author new legislation, and recall representatives (if any representatives are preserved). Technology for supporting EDD has been researched and developed at the Florida Institute of Technology,Kattamuri, et al. \\"Supporting Debates Over Citizen Initiatives\\", Digital Government Conference, pp 279-280, 2005 where the technology is used with student organizations. Numerous other software development projects are underway,List of active projects involved in the Metagovernment project along with many supporting and related projects.List of related projects from the Metagovernment project Several of these projects are now collaborating on a cross-platform architecture, under the umbrella of the Metagovernment project.Standardization project of the Metagovernment project. EDD as a system is not fully implemented in a political government anywhere in the world, although several initiatives are currently forming. Ross Perot was a prominent advocate of EDD when he advocated \\"electronic town halls\\" during his 1992 and 1996 Presidential campaigns in the United States. Switzerland, already partially governed by direct democracy, is making progress towards such a system. Senator On-Line, an Australian political party established in 2007, proposes to institute an EDD system so that Australians can decide which way the senators vote on each and every bill. A similar initiative was formed 2002 in Sweden where the party Direktdemokraterna, running for the Swedish parliament, offers its members the power to decide the actions of the party over all or some areas of decision, or to use a proxy with immediate recall for one or several areas. The Direktdemokraterna party in Sweden advocates EDD. =Liquid democracy= Liquid democracy, or direct democracy with delegable proxy, would allow citizens to choose a proxy to vote on their behalf while retaining the right to cast their own vote on legislation. The voting and the appointment of proxies could be done electronically. Taking this further, the proxies could form proxy chains, in which if A appoints B and B appoints C, and neither A nor B vote on a proposed bill but C does, C's vote will count for all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies in order of preference, so that if their first choice proxy fails to vote, their vote can be cast by their second-choice proxy. =Wikidemocracy= One proposed form of e-democracy is \\"wikidemocracy\\", with a government legislature whose codex of laws was an editable wiki, like Wikipedia. In 2012, J Manuel Feliz-Teixeira said he believed the resources to implement wikidemocracy were available. He envisions a wiki-system in which there would be three wings of legislative, executive and judiciary roles for which every citizen could have a voice with free access to the wiki and a personal ID to continuously reform policies until the last day of December (when all votes would be counted). Advantages to wikidemocracy include a no-cost system with the removal of elections, no need for parliament or representatives because citizens directly represent themselves, and ease of access to voice one's opinion. However, there are obstacles, uncertainties and disagreements. First, the digital divide and low quality of education can be deterrents to achieve the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly, there is a diffusion of innovation in response to new technologies in which some people readily adopt novel ways and others at the opposite end of the spectrum reject them or are slow to adapt. It is also uncertain how secure this type of democracy would be because we would have to trust that the system administrator would have a high level of integrity to protect the votes saved to the public domain. Lastly, Peter Levine agrees that wikidemocracy would increase discussion on political and moral issues, but he disagrees with Feliz-Teixeira who argues that wikidemocracy would remove the need for representatives and formal governmental structures. Wikidemocracy is also used to mean more limited instantiations of e-democracy, such as in Argentina in August 2011, where the polling records of the presidential election were made available to the public in online form, for vetting. The term has also been used in a more general way to refer to the democratic values and environments offered by wikis. In 2011, some in Finland undertook an experiment in wikidemocracy by creating a \\"shadow government program\\" on the Internet, essentially a compilation of the political views and aspirations of various groups in Finland, on a wiki.

H√∏nefoss is an industrial center of inner √òstlandet, containing several factories and other industry. As of 1 January 2008, H√∏nefoss has 14,177 inhabitants. In 1852, H√∏nefoss received town status and was separated from Norderhov. In 1964, H√∏nefoss ceased being a separate municipality and became part of Ringerike. Etymology The town is named after H√∏nefossen, a waterfall on the Begna River. The first element is the name of the old farm H√∏nen (Old Norse *H≈ìnvin), the last element is foss meaning 'waterfall'. The name of the farm is a compound of a word *h≈ìn- (with an unknown meaning) and vin f 'meadow'.Oluf Rygh (1897) ¬´Norske Gaardnavne¬ª. 86. H√∏nen Location H√∏nefoss is located 63 kilometres northwest by road from the Norwegian capital of Oslo. H√∏nefoss is situated north of Lake Tyrifjorden. At H√∏nefoss, the Begna flows together with the Randselva river just below H√∏nefossen forming the Storelva river which flows into Nordfjord, the upper west branch of Lake Tyrifjord. Transportation European route E16 runs near H√∏nefoss on its way from Oslo to Bergen. H√∏nefoss is connected to Norwegian national road 35 (Rv 35) which passes within town limits. Norwegian National Road 7 from Granvin in Hordaland ends at H√∏nefoss. H√∏nefoss Station is located at the intersection between the Bergen Line (Bergensbanen), the Randsfjord Line and the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line. The rail station was opened in 1868 when the Randsfjord Line was extended from Tyristand to Randsfjord. The current station building was put into operation in 1909, in connection with the opening of the Bergen Line between Oslo and Geilo. Economy H√∏nefoss is home to several factories and other industry, with Norske Skog Follum maintaining its headquarters in the city. Dating from 1873, Norske Skog Follum was one of the largest producers of newsprint in Europe. The paper mill closed in 2012. Ringerikes Blad is a regional newspaper covering Ringerike, Hole and Jevnaker. Established in 1845, the newspaper is published daily in H√∏nefoss.

The museum is noted for its icon collection, its rune stones and its collection of the private belongings of J√∏rgen Engebretsen Moe. J√∏rgen Moe was a Norwegian author, who is best known for the Norske Folkeeventyr, a collection of Norwegian folk tales which he edited in collaboration with Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen. It is affiliated with the Buskerud Museum (Buskerudmuseet). Buskerud Photography Archive (Buskerud fylkesfotoarkiv) is a central archive for photography and photo- historical material from Buskerud. The archives accommodates approx. 200,000 photographs dating from the 1850s. Buskerud fylkesfotoarkiv has shared office space with the Ringerikes Museum in Norderhov and is affiliated with the Buskerud Museum (Buskerudmuseet). Veien Cultural Heritage Park (Veien Kulturminnepark) is in located in H√∏nefoss. The park contains over 100 grave mounds from the Early Iron Age, as well as a reconstructed longhouse and a museum. It is affiliated with the Buskerud Museum (Buskerudmuseet). Ridder Farm (Ridderg√•rden) is located on the north side of H√∏nefoss. This had been a family farm dating to 1730.

Early life James Kilfedder, born in Kinlough, County Leitrim to a family from Enniskillen, was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen and Trinity College Dublin. During his time in college he acted as Auditor of the College Historical Society, one of the oldest undergraduate debating society in the world. He became a barrister, called to the Irish Bar at King's Inns, Dublin, in 1952 and the English Bar at Gray's Inn in 1958. He practised law in London. Political career At the 1964 general election, Kilfedder was elected as an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Member of Parliament for West Belfast. During the campaign there were riots in Divis Street when the police removed an Irish flag from the Sinn F√©in offices of Billy McMillen after a complaint by Kilfedder in the form of a telegram to the Minister of Home Affairs, Brian McConnell. It read \\"Remove tricolour in Divis Street which is aimed to provoke and insult loyalists of Belfast.\\"Andy Boyd: Holy War in Belfast Kilfedder lost his seat at the 1966 election to Gerry Fitt. He was elected again in the 1970 general election for North Down, and held the seat until his death in 1995. Kilfedder was elected for North Down in the 1973 Assembly election, signing Brian Faulkner's pledge to support the White Paper which eventually established the Sunningdale Agreement but becoming an anti-White Paper Unionist after the election. In 1975 he stood for the same constituency in the Constitutional Convention election, polling over three quotas as a UUP member of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition (UUUC) although he refused to sign the UUUC's pledge of conduct. He left the UUP in 1977 in opposition to the party's policies tending to integrationism, preferring to advocate the restoration of the Stormont administration. For a time he sat as an \\"Independent Ulster Unionist\\". He contested the 1979 European Parliament Election under that label, finishing fourth in the count for the three seats, having overtaken the UUP leader Harry West on transfers. In 1980 he formed the Ulster Popular Unionist Party (UPUP) and was re-elected under that label in all subsequent elections. He again topped the poll in the 1982 Assembly election and was elected as Speaker of the AssemblyRobert Waller, Almanac of British Politics, 3rd edition (to 1986). He generally took the Conservative whip at Westminster.Waller and Criddle, Almanac of British Politics, 6th edition Whilst Speaker he was paid more than the Prime Minister. Death and legacy On 20 March 1995, while travelling by train into London from Gatwick airport, Kilfedder died of a heart attack. This was the same day that the Belfast Telegraph carried a front-page story saying that an Ulster MP had been targeted as one of twenty MPs invited by the LGBT rights organisation OutRage! in a letter to come out.Angus McLaren, Sexual Blackmail: A Modern History, Harvard University Press, 2002 and the Belfast Telegraph of that date He died unmarried, survived by two sisters. Kilfedder was described as > \\"a phenomenon or perhaps a left-over from a remote era of Northern Irish > politics when Ulster was represented by such figures as Lord Robert > Grosvenor, Major Robin Chichester-Clark, Stratton Mills, and Rafton > Pounder.\\" Kilfedder was described by Democratic Unionist Party MLA Peter Weir as \\"the best MP North Down ever had.\\" The UPUP did not outlive him, and the by- election for his Commons seat was won by Robert McCartney standing for the UK Unionist Party. He had fought the seat in the 1987 general election as a \\"Real Unionist\\" with the backing of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship. At the 1987 election count, in his victory speech, Kilfedder had \\"attacked his rival's supporters as 'a rag tag collection of people who shame the name of civil rights.' He said they included communists, Protestant paramilitaries and Gay Rights supporters and he promised to expose more in future.\\"Co. Down Spectator, 18 June 1987 McCartney lost North Down in 2001 to Lady Hermon of the UUP. Kilfedder's personal and political papers (including constituency affairs) are held at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, reference D4127.

The SIPP is designed to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the incomes of American individuals and households and their participation in income transfer programs. The survey's mission is to provide a nationally representative sample for evaluating annual and sub-annual income dynamics, movements into and out of government transfer programs, family and social context of individuals and households, and interactions among these items. A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the use of and eligibility for government programs and to analyze the impacts of options for modifying them. SIPP data are used to evaluate the effectiveness of Federal, state, and local government programs. Methods The SIPP gathers information from a series of panels, each with 14,000 to 37,000 households. Each panel lasts from 2.5 to 4 years. The SIPP sample is a multistage-stratified sample of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population. The respondents are all household members 15 years or older. Each wave of interviews lasts four months. Interviews are conducted by personal visits and telephone calls. Certain core questions are asked in every survey. Respondents are asked whether or not they participate in the labor force, what government programs they participated in, and about their incomes. Additional ‚Äútopical modules‚Äù are added to the SIPP survey sometimes with questions on personal history, child care, wealth, program eligibility, child support, disability, school enrollment, taxes, and annual income. The Census Bureau sponsors the survey under the authority of Title 13 of the United States Code, Section 182. The SIPP was developed from the Income Survey Development Program, conducted between 1977 and 1981, which developed survey data collection strategies and instruments as well as data processing strategies for the SIPP. Statistics Canada conducts an analogous survey, the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID), which is a longitudinal study following each of a panel of 15,000 households for 6 years.Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) - A Survey Overview at Statistics Canada siteSLID (official) website.  Content  While the main objective of SIPP is to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the income and program participation of individuals and households in the United States, SIPP also collects extensive data on many additional factors of economic well-being. Financial situations of households and individuals are not solely determined by their employment status and income. In order to create a more complete representation of national well-being, SIPP also collects extensive information concerning family dynamics, educational attainment, housing expenditures, asset ownership, health insurance, disability, childcare, and food security. These data put the income and program recipiency of individuals and households into the family and social context. Thus, researchers may examine the ways in which these factors interact to influence financial well- being and movement into or out-of government assistance programs.  Uses  https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p70-128.pdf The main objective of the SIPP is to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the income and program participation of individuals and households in the United States. The survey's mission is to provide a nationally representative sample for evaluating: 1. annual and sub-annual income dynamics, 2. movement into and out of government transfer or assistance programs, and 3. effects of our changing family and social situations for individuals and households. A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the use of and eligibility for government programs and to analyze the impacts of modifications to those programs. These kinds of information help in evaluating the economic status of the nation, show how things change, and give policy makers the facts that enable them to make better economic decisions. SIPP produces national-level estimates for the U.S. resident population and subgroups. Although the SIPP design allows for both longitudinal and cross-sectional data analysis, SIPP is intended to primarily to support longitudinal studies. SIPP's longitudinal features allow the analysis of selected dynamic characteristics of the population, such as changes in income, eligibility for and participation in transfer programs, household and family composition, labor force behavior, and other associated events. One of the most important reasons for conducting SIPP is to gather detailed information on participation in transfer programs. Data from SIPP allow analysts to examine concurrent participation in multiple programs. SIPP data can also be used to address the following types of questions: *How have changes in eligibility rules or benefit levels affected recipients? *How have changes in the eligibility rules affected the program target population, that is, those eligible to receive benefits? *How does income from other household members affect labor force participation and reasons for not working? *How do wealth and income patterns differ for various age, gender, and racial groups? Because SIPP is a longitudinal survey, capturing changes in household and family composition over a multiyear period, it can also be used to address the following questions: *What factors affect change in household and family structure and living arrangements? *What are the interactions between changes in the structure of households and families and the distribution of income? *What effects do changes in household composition have on economic status and program eligibility? *What are the primary determinants of turnover in programs such as Food Stamps? *What factors affect change in household and family structure and living arrangements?https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs- surveys/sipp/about/SIPP_Factsheet.pdf Re-engineered SIPP In response to budget pressures, the Survey of Income and Program Participation nearly ceased to exist in 2006. The survey, then beginning the process to convert the existing instrument format to more modern software, suspended the instrument conversion and prepared to shut down operations. Fortunately, the strident backlash and public petition from the public policy, academic, and partner agency communities led a large contingent of Senators and Representatives from Congress to endorse the petition to request the reinstatement of SIPP's funding. With funding restored, the US Census Bureau began re-engineering the SIPP. The re-engineering focused on several key goals, including reducing burden on respondents, reducing program costs, improving accuracy, improving timeliness and accessibility, and improving relevance. The SIPP stakeholders and data users have been, and continue to be, critical partners for the SIPP program.https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/about/re-engineered- sipp.html Social Security Administration (SSA) Supplement Census Survey of Income and Program Participation The U.S. Census Bureau conducted the Social Security Administration Supplement on Retirement, Pensions, and Related Content (SSA Supplement) on behalf of the SSA. The SSA Supplement is a separate survey from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), even though the sample includes households that completed 2014 Wave 1 SIPP interviews. The topics included in the SSA Supplement are from previous SIPP panel topical modules. Topics included in the SSA Supplement: *Personal retirement plan contributions and withdrawals *Participation in pension and retirement plans provided by an employer or business *Marital history *Health status *Work, Adult, and Child disabilities The 2014 SIPP removed these topics in order to reduce overall respondent burden since it is not necessary to ask them each wave. However, the SSA still needs the data from these topics to analyze the economic and social situation of people with disabilities and people in or approaching retirement. Examples include adjusting the age for retirement benefits, assessing people's ability to save for retirement, estimating the number of legally eligible people for Social Security divorce benefits, and evaluating and modifying the disability criteria for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility. The SSA Supplement was a one- time survey conducted after Wave 1 of the 2014 SIPP panel, from September through November 2014. All interviews were conducted by centralized telephone ‚Äì there was no personal visit component.

It evolved out of the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (founded in 1967). The association was one of the biggest advancements for women's athletics on the collegiate level. Throughout the 1970s, the AIAW grew rapidly in membership and influence, in parallel with the national growth of women's sports following the enactment of Title IX. The AIAW functioned in the equivalent role for college women's programs that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had been doing for men's programs. Owing to its own success, the AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA in the early 1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations staged women's championships, the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member schools continued their women's athletics programs under the governance of the NCAA. History Women's intercollegiate athletics were organized on a national basis in 1941, the year the first national collegiate championship was held in the sport of golf by the Division for Girls' and Women's Sports (DGWS) of the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, many colleges around the country had started women's sports teams that competed with other schools in their respective geographic areas. In 1956 the Tripartite Committee was formed by representatives of three organizations: the National Association for Physical Education for College Women, the National Association for Girls' and Women's Sport, and the American Federation of College Women.Hunt, Virginia: \\"Governance of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics: an Historical Perspective.\\" PhD Diss. University of North Carolina - Greensboro, 1976. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilms, 1977. Upon the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee, the National Joint Committee on Extramural Sports for College Women (NJCESCW) was formed in 1957 to guide and administer women's intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1965, with the desire to consolidate governance of women's intercollegiate athletics under one organization, the NJCESCW disbanded and agreed to let the DGWS assume control over competition and extramural events. The first action the DGWS took was to establish the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW) to assume responsibility for designing, sponsoring, and sanctioning women‚Äôs intercollegiate sports and championships. The purposes of the CIAW were (1) to provide the framework and organization for women's intercollegiate athletic opportunities and (2) to sponsor national championships for college women under the authority of the DGWS. The AIAW developed from the CIAW in recognition of the need for institutional membership and elected representation. Formation of the AIAW was approved by the DGWS Council and the AAHPER Board of Directors in 1971, but the CIAW continued to operate until early 1972, at which time the AIAW officially came into existence, with over 280 schools as members. At that time the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) had no interest in women's athletics, and administrators of the AIAW had no interest in the NCAA either. The NCAA was seen as being commercially driven and neglecting the meaning of the student-athlete. There were distinct differences between the two associations in the AIAW's early years. For example, student-athletes playing in AIAW programs were allowed to transfer freely between schools, and to prevent unfair advantages, programs were initially forbidden to offer scholarships and recruit off-campus. The AIAW continued the rules established by the CIAW, which were intended to prohibit unethical practices that were observed in men's sports. To enforce the rules, students receiving scholarships were forbidden from championship participation. The ban on scholarships ended in 1973, following a lawsuit by players and coaches from two colleges in Florida. The AIAW was not without criticism however, as some outsiders and individual members complained that the association devoted too much time, efforts, and funds securing distinction and independence from the NCAA. The annual softball tournaments and basketball tournaments received the most publicity and drew the biggest crowds; however, the association organized championships in various other sports. They included mainstream sports like volleyball and tennis but were as far reaching as badminton and fencing. Aside from national championships, individual schools worked together to stage annual state championships. While in existence, the AIAW organized and administered all competition at the regional and national levels. In 1981-82 the organization offered 41 national championships in 19 sports ‚Äî badminton, basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, indoor track and field, lacrosse, rowing, skiing, soccer, softball (fast and slow pitch), swimming and diving, synchronized swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The 1973 Basketball Tournament was the first sign that women's sports could be financially successful. Over 3,000 fans watched the final game between Queens and Immaculata, and the tournament earned over $4,500 in profits. In 1975 these two teams met again, this time in Madison Square Garden. The first women's basketball game to be played in the arena drew a crowd of more than 12,000 spectators. The AIAW started to take advantage of corporate sponsorships and television payouts not unlike its male counterpart, but on a smaller scale. In 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Although the impact today is primarily discussed in terms of the impact on athletics, the bill made no explicit mention of athletics. The bill provided that neither men nor women could \\"be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\\". The task of issuing regulations fell to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). One of its early decisions was that athletic programs would indeed be subject to the requirements of the law. The effect was to require the creation of new women's teams instead of stipulating that women could simply try out for men's teams. Consequently, the regulations required colleges to provide equal opportunities for both genders in collegiate athletics. Any school that received federal funds was required to provide gender equality by the 1978-79 school year. In 1974 colleges started giving scholarships to female student-athletes. That year (aside from the exceptional Wayland College basketball team in the 1950s), Ann Meyers became the first female to receive a full scholarship by committing to play for UCLA. Title IX is credited with the vast improvement in funding for women's athletics. By 1980, the average university spent over 16% of its athletics budget on women's sports. In the early 1970s that number was less than 1%. Although the regulations promulgated under the law required additional funding for women's teams, athletic directors did not immediately embrace the requirements. Their concerns included the relative inability for many schools to sufficiently fund the necessary women's teams, making it possible for the budgets for men's teams to be reduced to achieve compliance. The NCAA, which regulated men's intercollegiate sports, raised money to help fight Title IX. In 1974 the Senate passed the Tower Amendment, which decreed that Title IX did not cover football or other revenue-producing sports. The recently formed AIAW responded, hiring a lawyer, Margot Polivy, to fight the Tower Amendment. Their efforts were successful, as a joint Congressional conference committee decided to eliminate the Tower Amendment. On June 1, 1979, the AIAW assumed a separate legal identity and became a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia. Then in 1981, following the NCAA's decision to offer championships for women in its top competitive division, Division I, the AIAW suffered substantial losses of members and revenue. = AIAW vs. NCAA = At its peak, the AIAW had almost 1,000 member schools. In the late 1970s, however, schools began to realize that women's athletics could be profitable, and the NCAA decided to offer women's championships. The NCAA's Divisions II and III voted to offer championships in 1980; however, Division I members failed to gain a majority vote on this issue until the 1981 national meeting. This decision was quite contentious. During the tense floor debate, AIAW representatives objected to the motion to sponsor Division I championships, but their objections were met with pockets of \\"ridicule and hissing\\". After considerable debate, a vote was called, and the initial result was a tie, 124‚Äì124. A recount of the votes revealed the defeat of the motion by a vote of 128‚Äì127. However, parliamentary rules permit \\"reconsideration\\" of a vote if someone on the prevailing side asks for it. Several delegates on the losing side knew of one institution that had voted against the motion but whose faculty representative favored the NCAA position. When the influencer of the school‚Äôs \\"nay\\" vote left the room, those delegates prevailed upon that representative to request reconsideration. This time it passed, 137‚Äì117. For the 1981-82 academic year, schools were able to compete in either the NCAA or the AIAW championships. There were a few occasions when a school participated in both tournaments that year (Florida in gymnastics, 1982; Oklahoma State in softball, 1982; indeed the University of Tulsa won both the AIAW and NCAA women's golf championships in 1982). However, the battle of members had started, as schools whose men's teams were already participating in the NCAA started to integrate their women's teams. Although some schools permitted their individual women's teams to choose, most schools made the weighty decision to support only one of the two organizations. The AIAW had fought for women's rights in the Title IX battle, while the NCAA had opposed those efforts. In contrast, the NCAA was much better funded and had better access to television contracts. The University of Texas, where the last AIAW president, Donna Lopiano, was the women's athletics director, was one of the stronger holdouts. But when seventeen of the top twenty basketball teams agreed to enter the NCAA tournament, it proved to be the end for the AIAW. In 1982 the first Division I NCAA Women‚Äôs Basketball Tournament was held. The NCAA was able to offer incentives, such as payment of transportation costs, to participating members, something the AIAW was not able to do. When former AIAW powerhouses like Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, and Old Dominion decided to participate in the NCAA tournament, the AIAW tournament lost much of its appeal and popularity. NBC canceled its TV contract with the association, and in mid-1982 the AIAW stopped operations in all sports. Following the last AIAW sanctioned event in 1982, the AIAW pursued a federal anti-trust suit against the NCAA. But one year later, after the presiding judge ruled against the organization, the AIAW ceased existence on June 30, 1983. Under NCAA governance, scholarships increased. However, several problems the NCAA was facing, then and now, began to also affect women's intercollegiate athletics. Examples of these include recruiting irregularities and increased turnover in coaching positions for revenue-producing sports. Several AIAW championships were televised by the TVS Television Network in 1979.

Her parents Antamma and Veera Reddy live in Madanapalle, Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.Mother Meera, \\"Answers, part II\\", page 21 -23 In 1974, uncle Reddy brought Mother Meera to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Puducherry, India, of which he was a member.Adilakshmi, 'The Mother', page 10 There she first met Westerners and started to give Darshan. She is however not associated with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram today. In 1979 she was invited by her first devotees to Canada, where she went several times. Meanwhile, uncle Reddy's health started to deteriorate. In 1981 she made her first trip to West Germany, where she, together with uncle Reddy and her close companion Adilakshmi, settled down a year later. She married a German in 1982. Uncle Reddy died in 1985 and was buried in the local cemetery in Dornburg-Thalheim, Hesse.Adilakshmi, 'The Mother', page 7 For some years now, she has been giving Darshan (literally seeing, primarily in a spiritual context) at Schloss Schaumburg in Balduinstein, a small town in Germany. Previously, in the early 1990s, she gave Darshan in a house in the town of Thalheim, some 5 km northwest of Hadamar in Germany. She also visits the United States on a regular basis (see links below). Activities Mother Meera receives thousands of visitors of all religions for darshan which she conducts in total silence. Her darshan consists of a ritual, where she will touch a person's head, and then look into their eyes. During this process, she reportedly 'unties knots' in the person's subtle system and permeates them with light.Adilakshmi, \\"The Mother\\", pages 87 -88 She doesn't charge any money for doing so and she will not give lectures. Mother Meera's reported task on Earth was in calling down a dynamic light- force from the Supreme (Paramatman ‚Äì the supreme Self) in collaboration with other saints and divine beings, as she says, making spiritual progress on earth easier.Adilakshmi, \\"The Mother\\", pages 38 ‚Äì 40 About this light she says: Through Japa, the mental remembrance of any Divine Name or Mantra, which may be done informally, and whenever convenient, people could open themselves up to this Light.Mother Meera, \\"Answers, Part I\\", pages 89 -98 She does not claim to be a guru or have followers. To be connected to her work, people do not have to recognise her. Her teaching is mainly related to Bhakti, that is devotion to God, and in that she accepts all denominations. Mother Meera does not belong to any particular tradition, except for a certain closeness to the work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother,See 'Sri Aurobindo Research Academy' in Mother Meera, \\"Answers, Part II\\", pages 189 ‚Äì 195 whom she was reported to have met in their subtle bodies, when she was a child, visiting their Samadhi (grave).Adilakshmi, \\"The Mother\\", pages 10 ‚Äì 12 She teaches the unity of all religions. Everyone can go their own ways. It is only important to be connected with the light (the personal spiritual role model) every day by praying, reading or meditating.  Critics  After splitting from Mother Meera, the writer and former follower Andrew Harvey wrote The Sun at Midnight.Harvey, Andrew, The Sun at Midnight: A Memoir of the Dark Night, 2002, In it, Harvey accused Meera of homophobia, saying that Mother Meera disapproved of Harvey's marriage to another man. In his first book about her, Hidden Journey, Harvey had originally praised her as an avatar, attributing his own claimed enlightenment to her. Harvey's accusation of homophobia is disputed. One of Harvey's former lovers, the writer Mark Matousek (1997),Homepage said that: \\"I do know that the idea that she's homophobic is completely ridiculous.

It is set in the fictitious town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. The novel was adapted into a film, Ethan Frome, in 1993. Plot The novel is a framed narrative. The framing story concerns an unnamed male narrator spending a winter in Starkfield while in the area on business. He spots a limping, quiet man around the village, who is somehow compelling in his demeanor and carriage. This is Ethan Frome, who is a lifelong resident and a local fixture of the community. Frome is described by the narrator as \\"the most striking figure in Starkfield\\", \\"the ruin of a man\\" with a \\"careless powerful look ... in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain\\". Curious, the narrator sets out to learn about him. He learns that Frome's limp arose from having been injured in a \\"smash-up\\" twenty-four years before, but further details are not forthcoming, and the narrator fails to learn much more from Frome's fellow townspeople other than that Ethan's attempt at higher education decades before was thwarted by the sudden illness of his father following an injury, forcing his return to the farm to assist his parents, never to leave again. Because people seem not to wish to speak other than in vague and general terms about Frome's past, the narrator's curiosity grows, but he learns little more. Chance circumstances arise that allow the narrator to hire Frome as his driver for a week. A severe snowstorm during one of their journeys forces Frome to allow the narrator to shelter at his home one night. Just as the two are entering Frome's house, the prologue ends and the framed story begins. The narration switches from the first-person narrator of the prologue to a limited third-person narrator. We then embark on the \\"first\\" chapter (Chapter I), which takes place twenty-four years prior. In Chapter I, Ethan is waiting outside a church dance for Mattie, his wife's cousin, who has for a year lived with Ethan and his sickly wife, Zeena (Zenobia), in order to help out around the house and farm. Mattie is given the occasional night off to entertain herself in town as partial recompense for helping care for the Fromes, and Ethan has the duty of walking her home. It is quickly clear that Ethan has deep feelings for Mattie. Passing the graveyard, he thinks in an intense moment of foreshadowing that, \\"We'll always go on living here together, and some day she'll lie there beside me.\\" It also becomes clear that Zeena has observed enough to understand that he has these feelings and, understandably, she resents them. When Zeena leaves for an overnight visit to seek treatment for her various complaints and symptoms in a neighboring town, Ethan is excited to have an evening alone with Mattie. During this evening, the narrator reveals small actions that show that they each have feelings for the other, including a lingering of touching hands on the milk jug, although neither openly declares their love. Mattie makes supper and retrieves from a high shelf Zeena's treasured pickle dish, which Zeena, in a symbol of her stingy nature, never uses, in order to protect it. Mattie uses it to present Ethan with a simple supper, and disaster ensues when the Fromes' cat jumps on the table and knocks it off, shattering it beyond repair. Ethan tries to help by setting the dish's pieces neatly in the cupboard, presenting the false impression of wholeness if not examined closely, with plans to purchase some glue and fix it as soon as he can. In the morning Ethan's hopes for more private time with Mattie are foiled by the presence of his hired man. Ethan then goes into town to buy glue for the broken pickle dish, and upon his return finds that Zeena has also come home. Zeena retreats upstairs, proclaiming her illness, and refusing supper because she is not hungry. There, she informs Ethan that she plans to send Mattie away and has already hired another girl to replace her, claiming that she needs someone more efficient because her health is failing more rapidly than ever. Ethan is angry and frustrated to the point of panic by the thought of losing Mattie, and he is also worried for Mattie, who has no other place to go and no way to support herself in the world. He returns to the kitchen and joins Mattie, and tries to eat, but he is distraught and suddenly blurts out Zeena's plans to send Mattie away. Mattie reacts with shock but rapid acceptance, trying to calm Ethan, while Ethan becomes more agitated and begins to insist that he will not let her go. Ethan kisses her. Moments later, they are interrupted by Zeena, who has decided that she is hungry after all. After supper, Zeena discovers the broken pickle dish and is heartbroken and enraged; this betrayal cements her determination to send Mattie away. Ethan, miserable at the thought of losing Mattie and worried sick about her fate, considers running away with Mattie, but he lacks the money to do so. He feels that he cannot abandon Zeena because he knows that she would neither be able to run the farm nor sell it (the poor quality of the place has been discussed at several points in the story already). Every plan he thinks of is impossible to carry out, and he remains in despair and frantically trying to think of a way to change this one more turn of events against his ability to have a happy life. The next morning, Zeena describes her specific and imminent plans for sending Mattie on her way. Panicked, Ethan rushes into town to try to get a cash advance from a customer for a load of lumber in order to have the money with which to abscond with Mattie. His plan is unhinged by guilt, however, when his customer's wife expresses compassion, understanding, and empathy for Ethan's lot, which has involved the repeated duty to care for others, first his parents, then his sickly wife. He realizes that, of all people, he cannot cheat this kindly woman and her husband out of money, since she is one of the few people who have ever seemed to have seen or openly acknowledged Ethan's lifelong plight, as well as his honor in fulfilling his duties. Ethan returns to the farm and picks up Mattie to take her to the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled together as a way of delaying their sad parting, after which they anticipate never seeing each other again. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that they go down again, and steer the sled directly into a tree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. Ethan first refuses to go through with the plan, but in his despair that mirrors Mattie's, he ultimately agrees, and they get on the sled, clutching each other. On the way down, a vision of Zeena's face startles Ethan into swerving a bit, but he corrects their course, and they crash headlong and at high speed into the elm tree. Ethan regains consciousness after the accident but Mattie lies beside him, \\"cheeping\\" in pain like a small wounded animal. Ethan is also injured, and the reader is left to understand that this was the \\"smash-up\\" that left Ethan with a permanent limp. The epilogue returns to the framing story and the first-person narrator point of view of the prologue. The framing story resumes precisely where it left off: just as Frome and his visitor, the narrator, enter the Frome household in the story's present. The narrator hears a complaining female voice, and it is easy to assume that it belongs to the never-happy Zeena, but in the final twist of the story, it emerges that it is in fact Mattie, who now lives with the Fromes due to having been paralyzed in the accident. Her misery over her plight and dependence has embittered and \\"soured\\" her, and, with roles reversed, Zeena is now forced to care for her as well as Ethan. Further illustrating the psychosomatic nature of most of Zeena's previous complaints, she has now found the strength through necessity to be the caregiver rather than being the invalid. In an agonizing irony, Ethan and Mattie have gotten their wish to stay together, but in mutual unhappiness and discontent, with Mattie helpless and paralyzed, and with Zeena as a constant presence between the two of them. Development The story of Ethan Frome had initially begun as a French-language composition that Wharton had to write while studying the language in Paris, but several years later she took the story up again and transformed it into the novel it now is, basing her sense of New England culture and place on her ten years of living at The Mount, her home in Lenox, Massachusetts. She would read portions of her novel- in-progress each day to her good friend Walter Berry, who was an international lawyer. Wharton likely based the story of Ethan and Mattie's sledding experience on an accident that she had heard about in 1904 in Lenox, Massachusetts. Five people total were involved in the real-life accident, four girls and one boy. They crashed into a lamppost while sledding down Courthouse Hill in Lenox. A girl named Emily Hazel Crosby was killed in the accident. Wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived, Kate Spencer, when the two became friends while both worked at the Lenox Library. Kate Spencer suffered from a hip injury in the accident and also had facial injuries. It is among the few works by Wharton with a rural setting. Wharton found the notion of the tragic sledding crash to be irresistible as a potential extended metaphor for the wrongdoings of a secret love affair. Lenox is also where Wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with at least one of the victims of the accident; victims of the accident are buried in graves nearby Wharton family members. In her introduction to the novel, Wharton talks of the \\"outcropping granite\\" of New England, the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people. The connection between land and people is very much a part of naturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man's fate, and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of Starkfield's winters.Lewis, R.W.B. Edith Wharton: A Biography. New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1975. Reception The New York Times called Ethan Frome \\"a compelling and haunting story.\\" Edith Wharton was able to write an appealing book and separate it from her other works, where her characters in Ethan Frome are not of the elite upper class. However, the problems that the characters endure are still consistently the same, where the protagonist has to decide whether or not to fulfill their duty or follow their heart. She began writing Ethan Frome in the early 1900s when she was still married. The novel was criticized by Lionel Trilling as lacking in moral or ethical significance. Trilling wrote that the ending is \\"terrible to contemplate,\\" but that \\"the mind can do nothing with it, can only endure it.\\"\\"Review of Ethan Frome\\" . NovelGuide: Ethan Frome. Novelgide.com, n.d. February 24, 2010. Jeffrey Lilburn notes that some find \\"the suffering endured by Wharton's characters is excessive and unjustified,\\" but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and note that it \\"provides insightful commentary on the American economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering.\\" Wharton was always careful to label Ethan Frome as a tale rather than a novel. Critics did take note of this when reviewing the book. Elizabeth Ammons compared the work to fairy tales. She found a story that is \\"as moral as the classic fairy tale\\" and that functions as a \\"realistic social criticism.\\" The moral concepts, as described by Ammons, are revealed with all of the brutality of Starkfield's winters. Comparing Mattie Silver and Zeena Frome, Ammons suggests that the Matties will grow as frigid and crippled as the Zeenas, so long as such women remain isolated and dependent. Wharton cripples Mattie, says Lilburn, but has her survive in order to demonstrate the cruelty of the culture surrounding women in that period.Lilburn, Jeffrey. \\"Ethan Frome (Criticism).\\" Answers.com.

It can be found in soil, water, and fecal matter. It is grouped with the Morganellaceae and is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. It is known to cause wound infections and other species of its genera are known to cause urinary tract infections. P. vulgaris was one of the three species Hauser isolated from putrefied meat and identified (1885). Over the past two decades, the genus Proteus, and in particular P. vulgaris, has undergone a number of major taxonomic revisions. In 1982, P. vulgaris was separated into three biogroups on the basis of indole production. Biogroup one was indole negative and represented a new species, P. penneri, while biogroups two and three remained together as P. vulgaris.  Lab identification  According to laboratory fermentation tests, P. vulgaris ferments glucose and amygdalin, but does not ferment mannitol or lactose. P. vulgaris also tests positive for the methyl red (mixed acid fermentation) test and is also an extremely motile organism. When P. vulgaris is tested using the API 20E identification system it produces positive results for sulfur reduction, urease production, tryptophan deaminase production, indole production, sometimes positive gelatinase activity, and saccharose fermentation, and negative results for the remainder of the tests on the testing strip. It is referenced in the Analytical Profile Index using the nine-digit code: 047602157. The optimal growing conditions of this organism is in a facultative anaerobic environment with an average temperature of about 40 ¬∞C. The Becton/Dickinson BBL Enterotube II system for identification of members of the order Enterobacterales inoculated with P. vulgaris may yield the following results: *Positive for glucose fermentation (with gas production) *Negative for lysine and ornithine *Positive for hydrogen sulfide production and indole production *Negative for lactose, arabinose, adonitol, sorbitol and dulcitol *Positive for the phenylalanine test and the Harnstoff urea test P. vulgaris can test positive or negative for citrate. All combine for a Biocode ID of 31406, (Biocode ID 31402, 31404, 31407 all resulting in P. vulgaris with asymptomatic results) for use in the Interpretation Guide/Computer Coding and Identification System. P. vulgaris can also test urease negative in solid media (such as in Enterotube), but will be urease positive in liquid media. The CCIS code will still identify it with a negative urease test. When inoculated in a gelatin stab test, P. vulgaris is capable of hydrolysis of gelatin.  Proteus infections  = Cause and epidemiology = *Nosocomial infections *P. mirabilis causes 9% of Proteus infections. *P. vulgaris and P. penneri are easily isolated from individuals in long-term care facilities and hospitals and from patients with underlying diseases or compromised immune systems. *Patients with recurrent infections, those with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, those who have had urethral instrumentation, and those whose infections were acquired in the hospital have an increased frequency of infection caused by Proteus and other organisms (e.g., Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, enterococci, and staphylococci). *P. vulgaris is highly resistant to antibiotics because of the plasmids present in the bacterium, making infections extremely difficult to cure. This is because the plasmids have varied drug resistant markers on them. = Clinical expression = Enterobacterales (of which Proteus is a member) and Pseudomonas species are the micro-organisms most commonly responsible for Gram-negative bacteremia and sepsis. The presence of the sepsis syndrome associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI) should raise the possibility of urinary tract obstruction. This is especially true of patients who reside in long-term care facilities, who have long-term indwelling urethral catheters, or who have a known history of urethral anatomic abnormalities. ;UTI obstruction Urease production leads to precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds, which leads to struvite stone formation. Struvite stones are composed of a combination of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite. Struvite stone formation can be sustained only when ammonia production is increased and the urine pH is elevated to decrease the solubility of phosphate. Both of these requirements can occur only when urine is infected with a urease-producing organism such as Proteus. Urease metabolizes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide: urea 2 NH3 \\\\+ CO2. The ammonia/ammonium buffer pair has a pK of 9.0, resulting in the combination of highly alkaline, ammonia-rich urine. Symptoms attributable to struvite stones are uncommon. More often, women present with UTI, flank pain, or hematuria, and are found to have a persistently alkaline urine pH (>7.0).  Treatments  Antibiotics to which P. vulgaris is known to be sensitive: *Ciprofloxacin *Ceftazidime *Netilmicin *Sulbactam or cefoperazone *Meropenem *Piperacillin/tazobactam *Ampicillin/sulbactam See also * Proteus OX19 * Swarming motility References ‚ÄúProteus Vulgaris.‚Äù Thistle, Thistle.co, www.thistle.co.za/pdf_files/education/microbiology/microbiology_legends/Cycle_41/Cycle%2041%20Organism%203%20-%20Proteus%20Vulgaris.pdf.

During his tenure, he served as the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He was a member of the Democratic Party. On November 2, 2010, he lost his seat to Republican Vicky Hartzler amid a Republican wave. Notably, he was one of three Democratic committee chairmen to lose reelection in the 2010 midterm cycle, alongside House Budget Committee chairman John Spratt of South Carolina and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman Jim Oberstar of Minnesota. Early life, education and career Skelton was born in Lexington, Missouri, a rural town with extensive Civil War history. He was the son of Carolyn Marie (Boone) and Isaac Newton Skelton III. In 1928, Skelton's father met Harry S. Truman, then a Jackson County judge, and the men became good friends. When he was 17, Skelton attended Truman's 1949 inauguration. Skelton was an Eagle Scout. He earned an associate of arts degree from Wentworth Military Academy and College in 1951, an A.B. in 1953 and an LL.B. in 1956 from the University of Missouri. He is a brother of Sigma Chi and Alpha Phi Omega at the University of Missouri. He also attended the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1953. Skelton then became a lawyer and entered private practice in Lafayette County, Missouri. He was a prosecuting attorney from 1957 until 1960 and a special assistant attorney general. Missouri Senate Skelton was a member of the Missouri Senate, representing Lafayette County, from 1971 until 1977. U.S. House of Representatives Inaugural Congressional photo of Skelton from the 1977 Congressional Pictorial Directory. =Committee assignments= *Committee on Armed Services (Chairman) As chairman of the full committee, Skelton served as an ex officio member of all subcommittees. Skelton served as Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, having previously served as Ranking Member on the House Armed Services Committee since 1998 but was promoted to Chairman following the 2006 midterm elections when Democrats regained control of Congress. Political positions Skelton voted with Democratic leadership 94.6% of the time during the 111th Congress, meaning he broke with his party more frequently than 82% of the Democratic Caucus. Vicky Hartzler, Skelton's 2010 Congressional opponent, stated on the campaign trail that Skelton has voted in line with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 95% of the time during his tenure in the House. Before the 2006 election, Skelton told columnist George Will that if the Democrats won control of Congress, his main priority would be \\"oversight, oversight, oversight!\\" While he voted for the War in Iraq, he expressed serious misgivings about troop readiness. In 2006, he favored reducing the number of troops in Iraq and supported redeploying a brigade from Iraq to Kuwait. Will suggested that under Skelton, the Armed Services Committee would resemble a U.S. Senate committee created to examine defense spending during World War II. This committee was chaired by Skelton's hero, Harry S. Truman. =Fiscal issues= Skelton voted against the 2001 Bush Tax cuts.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll149.xml In 1981, he voted against Reagan's tax cuts. He was supportive of labor. The League of Conservation Voters rated Skelton at 53 percent on environmental issues. He was one of the few Congressional Democrats to vote in favor of CAFTA and mostly supported free trade deals. He was a supporter of TRiO programs. =Social issues= Skelton was fairly conservative on social issues. He opposed abortion and gun control. He helped craft the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, and voted against its repeal in 2010. =Military issues= Skelton was a long-time proponent of the Missouri National Guard, in recognition for which the National Guard Training Center in Jefferson City is named in his honor. However, at times he has disagreed with other members of Missouri's congressional delegation over the state's defense installations. In 2005, for instance, he opposed Senator Kit Bond's efforts to keep open the 131st Air National Guard Fighter Wing in St. Louis County. The wing was considered an \\"alert site\\" by the Defense Department, responsible for maintaining sovereignty over United States air space. In its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that the lack of alert sites, and with their positions primarily on the nation's periphery, reduced the capability of the military to respond effectively to the 9/11 attacks. Senator Bond testified in the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) hearings against the closure of the 131st, which was based at Lambert International Airport. He noted that this wing, which was located in a strategically important location, had protected critical assets on 09-11-01. He warned that the loss of the wing would compromise security over a vast area of the Midwestern United States. Representative Skelton, as the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, voted in favor of closure.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll548.xml The House passed the BRAC recommendations, and the base was subsequently closed, with its components deployed elsewhere. Controversy On October 8, 2009, Skelton, after addressing fellow Missouri Congressman Todd Akin, a Republican, on the House floor, said to Akin, \\"stick it up your ass.\\" The comment was picked up by the microphone and could be heard on the C-SPAN broadcast. Skelton's spokeswoman, Jennifer Kohl, said the comment was not intended to be broadcast and was \\"said out of frustration in the heat of debate.\\" Akin's spokesman, Steve Taylor, said the remark was \\"shocking and not characteristic of Skelton's behavior.\\" Political campaigns When William J. Randall retired after 17 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Skelton won the Democratic nomination to succeed him with 40% of the vote in a crowded primary field of nine Democratic candidates. He ran with the endorsement of Truman's widow, Bess, which he attributes to his own father's support for Harry S. Truman in the 1940 U.S. Senate primary. He was reelected 16 times, usually by well over 60 percent of the vote. Before 2010, he only faced one truly serious challenge, in 1982. That year, Missouri lost a district, and Skelton's district was merged with the neighboring 8th District, represented by freshman Republican Wendell Bailey. Although Skelton retained almost 60 percent of his former territory, Bailey held him to 54 percent of the vote. =2010= Skelton seemed to have a fairly secure hold on his district, even though it had been trending Republican for some time. The rural areas of the district, once solidly Democratic, had turned increasingly Republican since the turn of the century. Indeed, in 2000, Republicans captured most of the area's legislative seats and have held them ever since. Even before then, the district had been shedding more of the strongly Democratic areas near Kansas City due to that city's dwindling population. Before 1983, it stretched as far west as Independence, on Kansas City's eastern border. As a result, it had been pushed further into heavily Republican Southwest Missouri. Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama all won less than 40 percent of the vote in the district even as Skelton skated to reelection. It was considered very likely that Skelton would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired. In 2010, Skelton faced former Republican state representative Vicky Hartzler, who had been out of politics for more than a decade. Polls consistently showed a very competitive race, easily the most competitive the district had seen in decades. Most pundits rated it as a toss-up. Skelton lost to Hartzler, 50 percent to 45 percent. While Skelton ran evenly with Hartzler in the areas closer to Kansas City, he lost badly in the rural areas, including some that had supported him for many years. Since then, no Democrat has managed as much as 40 percent of the vote. Awards and honors In 2005 the U S Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Skelton its Naval Heritage award for his support of the U S Navy and military during his years in Congress. In 2010, Skelton was recognized by then, Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James F. Amos, as an Honorary Marine, the first U.S. congressman to be awarded the title.http://www.marines.mil/Community- Relations/Outreach-Programs/Honorary-Marine/ In 2012, the United States Military Academy recognized Skelton with the Sylvanus Thayer Award. In the same year, the USAF Air University presented Skelton with an honorary Doctor of Law degree for his work in the advancement of military education. Personal life His wife of 44 years, Susan Anding Skelton, died on August 23, 2005. Later that year, on November 26, Skelton was injured when a van carrying him and fellow U.S. Representatives Tim Murphy and Jim Marshall overturned near Baghdad Airport while on an official visit to Iraq. Skelton and Murphy were airlifted to a U.S. Military hospital in Germany after complaining of neck pain. Both made a full recovery. On August 29, 2009, Skelton married Patty Martin, a longtime friend and widowed middle school counselor from his home town. Skelton was a member of the Christian Church and an honorary chieftain in Scouting's Tribe of Mic-O-Say. He was also of distant relation to Daniel Boone as well as to U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter of New York.Barone & Cohen, 2008 Almanac of American Politics, p.958 = Death = Skelton died of pneumonia at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Virginia on October 28, 2013, at the age of 81.

Introduced by M√§rklin in 1972, Z scale trains operate on 0-10 volts DC and offer the same operating characteristics as all other two-rail, direct-current, analog model railways. Locomotives can be fitted with digital decoders for independent control. Model trains, track, structures, and human/animal figures are readily available in European, North American, and Japanese styles from a variety of manufacturers.  History  The sugar-cube sized electric motor in a Z scale model locomotive. The entire engine is only long. Z scale was introduced by the German model train manufacturer M√§rklin in 1972 at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. It was the brainchild of Helmut Killian, M√§rklin's head design engineer at the time. The letter Z was chosen to designate the new scale, its place as the last character of the German and English alphabets signaling the thought that there would never be a smaller commercial model railway scale. While there have been attempts since then to bring even smaller scales to the market, they remain niche products without a wider followingthe largest market being T gauge (1:450, gauge), designed in Japan and manufactured in China. Originally running on 8 V DC, track voltage was increased to 10 V DC around the year 2000. Accessory power has always been 10 V AC. In 1978, a M√§rklin Z scale locomotive pulling six coaches made its entry into the Guinness Book of World Records by running nonstop for 1,219 hours, and travelling a distance of before the train stopped due to failure of the motor. Z scale, at its inception, was predominantly a European scale, but it has an increasing number of followers in other parts of the world. There are now also manufacturers in North America and Japan and China, among others. Z scale enthusiasts throughout Europe, North America, and Japan participate regularly at most national and regional model railroad exhibitions and shows, where they have demonstrated the outstanding operation and layout design characteristics of the scale. While prices were initially higher for Z scale products (particularly locomotives) compared with those available in larger scales, as volume production, computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques, and the number of competing manufacturers increased, prices have come down to a point comparable to those of high-quality models in other scales. As early as 1988, M√§rklin announced their intention to offer digital train control systems in Z scale, and M√§rklin's 1988 Z scale product catalog listed three locomotives with a built-in digital decoder. However, the technology was not developed enough, and the manufacturer had to cancel these plans, mainly due to heat dissipation problems in locomotive decoders. Since then, these problems have been solved, Z scale has embraced advanced electronics (e.g., microprocessors originally developed for cell phones, surface-mount technology, etc.), and an increasing number of modellers have converted their locomotives to use third party digital model train control systems. The first attempts to use digital system in Z scale were based on NEM standard, Selectrix, which offered the smallest decoders in the market, with thicknesses of less than 2 mm. German company M√ºt brought also the first digital control central unit designed specially for Z scale in the market in the early 2000s. Use of the popular National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) Digital Command Control (DCC) standard has expanded substantially in Z scale recently as locomotive decoders with sizes comparable to the sizes of smallest Selectrix decoders have become available. Z scale is now a mature modelling scale, with model locomotives, rolling stock, buildings, signalling and human and animal figures becoming available in increasing numbers from an expanding variety of established and particularly smaller, fast-growing manufacturers. Z scale layouts have been winning local, regional, and national level competitions, such as best of show at the NMRA National Train Show (NTS) in July 2001, in St. Louis, MO.Photo, 2001 NTS Best of Show, NMRA.org and Jeffrey MacHan  Advantages  A \\"night shot\\" of a coffee-table sized Z scale layout The diminutive size of Z scale makes it possible to fit more scale space into the same physical layout as would be used by larger-scale models. Z scale can also be beneficial when there is a need to build very compact train layouts, such as novelty setups in briefcases, guitar cases, or jewellery boxes. Several transportation museums, for instance, have used Z scale to present real world railway scenes. Z scale allows longer trains and broader, more realistic curves than is practical in larger scales.  Drawbacks  \\"Val Ease East\\" division yard scene showing scratch-built Russell snow plow and detailed Mogul on the turntable. Due to the small size of Z scale and, in particular, the low weight of the locomotives (a small Z scale engine can weigh as little as ), it can be challenging to ensure reliable operation. In particular, the track must be kept clean, as minuscule particles of dust, dirt, or corrosion can easily stop locomotives. Poorly-installed trackwork can be a source of consistent derailing of rolling stock (although this is true, to some extent, in any scale). All of this can create issues for modellers who are interested in prototypical operationsin particular, switching. The low weight of Z scale locomotives contributes to their difficulty pulling trains up grades. In practice, the grade is kept under 2% for reliable operation of trains up to seven, four-axle cars; shorter trains can operate on grades up to 4%. Pulling power of locomotives can be increased by use of traction tires, or by adding weight using high-density materialtungsten powder (used in metal golf club driver heads) and lead are popular choices.Improving Locomotive Traction, Zscale.org The smaller market for Z scale results in a limited range of available products, including both rolling stock and accessories; some of the demand is therefore met by cottage industries.  Manufacturers  * The originator of Z scale, German manufacturer M√§rklin, still dominates the market for European prototype trains. M√§rklin couplers are unrealistic but can be easily coupled and uncoupled. * Micro-Trains Line (MTL) of Talent, Oregon, has joined M√§rklin as a major Z scale manufacturer and supplier of Z scale model locomotives, rolling stock, structures, and complete set track systems specializing in North American prototypes. MTL uses Magnematic couplers that can be uncoupled magnetically and enable operations that mimic prototype railroad activities such as delivering or picking up empty or loaded rail cars, building trains in classification yards, etc. Other manufacturers use fixed couplers that cannot be manipulated in this way. There is a growing number of smaller manufacturers, both in Europe and in North America, of Z scale specialty items such as detail parts, electronics, track-building aids, structures, scratch-building supplies, and tools in addition to rolling stock. * In addition to custom Z scale rolling stock for European, Japanese, and North American modelers, the German company Freudenreich Feinwerktechnik (FR) has introduced a complete narrow-gauge Z scale system with gauge track, which corresponds with metre gauge in prototype and is designated as Zm scale following the NEM standard scale naming system. * American Z Line (AZL) is a growing manufacturer producing a variety of highly detailed injection-molded North American prototype diesel locomotives and rolling stock as well as limited-run brass model steam and diesel locomotives. AZL has produced the largest variety of North American prototype locomotives and rolling stock available. * Rokuhan, a Japanese company, produces Japanese prototype rolling stock as well as structures, accessories, and a complete line of track products with simulated wooden and concrete ties suitable for North American themed model railroads. * Atlas produces two foot (610mm) long Z scale flex track and number 6 switches with North American tie spacing (closer than European because North American rail cars are heavier). * Peco produces three foot (914mm) long Z scale flex track with European tie spacing.

Introduced in September 2002, Roombas feature a set of sensors that enable them to navigate the floor area of a home and clean it. For instance, Roombas' sensors can detect the presence of obstacles, detect dirty spots on the floor, and sense steep drops to keep them from falling down stairs. The Roomba units have a range of models which provide several different features, such as tangle-free brushes, separate sweep canister, a more powerful vacuum, obstacle avoidance, or performance maps displayed via a smartphone app. However, some parts of the Roomba models are interchangeable between related models, allowing a mix/match of features, or switching into other units for longer battery operation. Newer high-end models also feature a camera, which works in conjunction with onboard mapping and navigation software to systematically cover all floor area, move from room to room, and find recharging bases and beacons. Additionally, some Roomba units can be adapted to perform other more creative tasks using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.  Description  Various Roomba internal parts Roomba recharging. Most Roomba models are disc-shaped, measuring in diameter and high depending on the model. The ninth generation S series are D-shaped rather than circular, with the flat part of the D at the front, and are narrower at wide. A large contact-sensing mechanical bumper is mounted on the front half of all Roombas, with an omnidirectional infrared sensor at its top front center. A recessed carrying handle is fitted on the top of most models. First- and second-generation Roombas are compatible with the Virtual Wall, an accessory used to prevent a Roomba from entering an area. The Virtual Wall projects a signal in a straight line (actually a thin fan or cone shape) using infrared light, which Roombas detect and treat the same as a physical wall, prompting them to stop and turn around. Third-generation and newer models are compatible with the Dual Mode Virtual Wall, which in addition to a straight line wall can also create a circular barrier roughly in diameter. Some 500-, 700- and 800-series models are compatible with the Virtual Wall Lighthouse. This initially confines a Roomba to one area to be cleaned like a Virtual Wall, and once the Roomba reports the area has been sufficiently cleaned (based on its estimated area) allows the Roomba to proceed to the next space which needs to be cleaned, and contains the Roomba to the new area.  Operation  Long exposure photo showing path taken by a Roomba as it cleans All Roomba models can be operated by manually carrying them to the room to be cleaned and pressing a button. Later models introduced several additional operating modes, such as \\"Spot\\" which cleans an area of a few feet and \\"Max\\" which cleans endlessly until the battery is depleted. \\"Dock\\" mode, introduced with the third generation, instructs the Roomba to seek a charging base for recharging. The availability of the modes varies by model. Many second- and third-generation Roombas come packaged with infrared remote controls, allowing a human operator to \\"drive\\" the Roomba to areas to be specially cleaned. Roombas are driven by two independently-operating side wheels, which can drive the Roomba forwards and backwards as well as perform turns of any radius, including 360¬∞ turns in place. Rotary encoders on the wheels can detect the rate at which the wheels are spinning so it can determine if they're slipping or stuck, and drop sensors detect if a wheel is too low (such as getting stuck in a vent). An undriven swivel caster (located at the front of most models, and at the back of the D-shaped S series) is used not for steering, as is often believed, but as an additional sensor. It too is a rotary encoder; the caster's wheel is half black and half white, and optical sensors detect the change in color as it rotates. This helps detect if the Roomba is stuck or beached (i.e., the drive wheels are spinning but the Roomba isn't moving). The cleaning head (brushes and suction area) on Roombas is relatively small. On most models, it is between the two side wheels, and is around wide; on the S series, it is moved to the flat square part of the D shape near the front where it is wider, but still does not extend the full width of the vehicle. To compensate for this, Roombas have a rotating multi- pronged brush on one side which sweeps debris towards the path of the cleaning head, helping to clean a wider path and to reach into edges and corners. Roombas before the seventh-generation models do not map out the rooms they are cleaning. Instead, iRobot developed a technology called iAdapt Responsive Cleaning Technology. This relies on a few simple algorithms, such as spiraling, room crossing, wall following, and random walk angle changing after bumping into an object or wall. This design is based on MIT researcher and iRobot CTO Rodney Brooks's philosophy that robots should be like insects, equipped with simple control mechanisms tuned to their environments. The result is that although Roombas are effective at cleaning rooms, they take several times longer to do the job than a human would. The Roomba may cover some areas many times, other areas only once or twice, and may miss some areas. However, the random algorithm has been shown to effectively cover rooms of various sizes and configurations, particularly when used repeatedly for maintenance cleaning. (Some users have used long-exposure photography or compositing to create images showing Roombas' coverage of the floor, and have even attached light sources to Roombas to create art using light painting. Some have also noted that doubts about the effectiveness of the random algorithms have been assuaged by multiple reports of Roombas rolling over dog feces and spreading it through the room, which rather unpleasantly illustrate how well the Roomba can cover the floor's area.) Roombas have become a common example of how randomized algorithms can probabilistically succeed even though they cannot absolutely guarantee success on any single run or even after many repeated runs. Compared to competing products available when Roombas were first introduced such as the Electrolux Trilobite, the effectiveness of Roombas' random navigation was on par with (or even more effective than) robotic mapping technology available at the time, and being cheaper to develop and produce, could be offered at a significantly lower price. Starting with the seventh generation, Roombas have an upwards-facing camera and a downward facing infrared floor-tracking sensor which are used to create a map of the floor. This enables them to use a more efficient back-and-forth cleaning pattern, which is faster and more efficient as it ensures more complete coverage without needing to cover an area multiple times. The floor-tracking sensor operates like an optical mouse and can provide precise movement data over small distances, but suffers from integration drift: small errors in measurement which accumulate over time. To rectify this, the upwards-facing camera is used periodically to identify waypoints or \\"landmarks\\", coarse points that are used to correct the Roombas' position and map. Some algorithms such as wall following are still used, partly to assist in mapping the floor and also simply to make sure the floor is cleaned along the edge and around obstacles. Unlike other mapping systems like lidar which can operate in complete darkness, Roombas' camera requires some light in the room in order to be able to map it. Starting with the eighth generation, Roombas retain the map after each run, and use subsequent runs to improve the map. Multiple maps can be stored, and users can edit maps to separate and label regions (such as rooms), which can be used to have the Roomba clean only a selected room. The Roombas' bumper allows them to sense when they have bumped into an obstacle, after which they will reverse or change paths. Infrared \\"cliff sensors\\" on the bottom of Roombas similarly prevent them from falling off ledges such as stairways. (These may also trigger a false positive on dark or black colored surfaces such as some carpets, preventing Roombas from entering or being able to clean those areas.) Third-generation and newer models have additional forward-looking infrared sensors to detect obstacles. These slow down the Roomba when nearing obstacles, to reduce its force of impact. It's also used to clean alongside walls without bumping into the wall repeatedly. This technology is also able to distinguish between hard and soft obstacles. Most second- and third-generation models and all newer ones have internal acoustic- based dirt sensors that allow them to detect particularly dirty spots and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation and newer models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes. The cleaning time depends on room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while subsequent models either estimate room size by measuring the longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object or create an accurate map of the room. When finished cleaning, or when the battery is nearly depleted, Roombas except for first-generation models will try to return to a base if one is detected. Roombas with mapping capability can also recharge and resume a cleaning job, enabling them to clean large areas that take more than one full battery of charge to complete. Roombas except for first-generation models also support scheduling, allowing cleaning to start at the time of day and on days of the week that the owner desires. Most 500-series models support scheduling through buttons on the unit itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote control, smartphone app, or smarthome automation integration to program schedules. Roombas are not designed for deep-pile carpet. Also, the first- and second-generation Roombas can get stuck on rug tassels and electrical cords. Third-generation and newer models are able to reverse their brushes to escape entangled cords and tassels. All models are designed to be low enough to go under a bed or most other items of furniture. If at any time the unit senses that it has become stuck, no longer senses the floor beneath it, or decides that it has worked its way into a narrow area from which it is unable to escape, it stops and sounds an error to help someone find it. Early models use only flashing lights to indicate specific problems, while later models use a synthesized voice to announce a problem and a suggested solution. =Maintenance= Roombas require regular cleaning and maintenance. Because they are smaller and less powerful than large upright vacuums, the dustbin must be emptied frequently (sometimes as often as every single use), and hair and other obstructions must be removed from rollers and brushes more frequently. Some reviewers have complained about this necessity compared to traditional upright vacuums that only need infrequent cleaning and almost no maintenance; however others have countered that the chore is not difficult, and that it takes significantly less time to clean a Roomba than it does to vacuum by hand. iRobot has been praised for the availability of replacement parts for Roombas, with official parts still being sold for every model including the first-generation Roombas, almost 20 years after their release. Roombas are powered by a user-replaceable rechargeable battery; older models used NiMH batteries, while newer models use lithium-ion batteries, and a few models support both. First-generation models must be recharged from a wall power adapter, while all subsequent models have a self- charging homebase that the unit seeks out at the end of a cleaning session via infrared beacons. Charging takes about three hours. =Connectivity= As opposed to hacking and extending Roomba, non Desktop users can use the iRobot HOME App, although only certain models support 5 GHz. = Battery life = Battery reliability is a frequently mentioned complaint on customer review websites. Battery replacements from iRobot cost a significant fraction of the purchase price of a new Roomba, though compatible third-party batteries are available at a lower price. The iRobot customer support website offers advice on maximizing battery performance and longevity.  Models  there have been nine generations of Roomba units. All models have a patented design using pair of brushes or rollers, rotating in opposite directions, to pick up debris from the floor. In some models, the brushes are followed by a squeegee vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase its speed in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted \\"side spinner\\" brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation, the dirty air passes through the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum. = First generation: Original series = Introduced in September 2002, the first-generation Roomba had three buttons for room size. The first- generation units comprised the original silver-colored Roomba, the blue Roomba Pro, and the maroon Roomba Pro Elite. The later two models included additional accessories, but all three used the same core robot and cleaning system. = Second generation: Discovery and 400 series = The second-generation Roombas (\\"Discovery\\", later called 400 series) replaced their predecessors in July 2004, added a larger dust bin, improved software that calculates room size, dirt detection, and fast charging in the home base. Room size is detected automatically based on the longest straight-line path that can be driven; instead of buttons for room size, their buttons are \\"Clean\\", \\"Spot\\", and \\"Max\\". Roomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a simplified interface (a single \\"Clean\\" button) and lacked some of the software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space that would be required for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment. The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010. = Third generation: Professional and 500 series = The 500 series was introduced in August 2007 and featured a forward-looking infrared sensor to detect obstacles and reduce speed, a docking command button, improved mechanical components, smoother operation, and a modular design to facilitate part replacement. The Roombas' speed is also increased, which is possible in part because of the sensors to avoid bumping into obstacles too hard. It also introduced customizable decorative face plates. The Roomba 530 included two virtual walls and a recharging dock. There are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series models. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum. The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The AeroVac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner. = Fourth generation: 600 series= In August 2012, the 500 series was superseded by the 600 series, which added the AeroVac Bin and advanced cleaning head as standard features. In 2017 they released the 690, which has Wi-Fi connectivity so it can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software. = Fifth generation: 700 series = The 701 series, introduced in May 2011, though largely similar to the 500 and 600 series, included a more robust cleaning system, improved AeroVac Bin with HEPA filter, and improved battery life. Like the 500 series, the 700 series had models with different technologies and accessories. The Roomba 760 was the simplest model, and Roomba 790 was the , with both scheduling and a large range of accessories including lighthouses, wireless command center (also compatible with select retrofitted 500-series models), and extra brushes and filters. Besides these two models, Roomba 770 and 780 were available, with scheduling, Dirt Detect, and full bin indicator. = Sixth generation: 800 series = The 800 series, introduced in 2013, is similar to the 700 series and its predecessors, but contains updated technology. The AeroForce Performance Cleaning System, which is five times more powerful than older series, and the iRobot XLife battery are some of the new features. The AeroForce system does away with the large rotating brush, and pulls air between two rubber rollers, thereby getting the vacuum suction closer to the floor. In 2017 iRobot released the 890 with Wi-Fi connectivity that can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software. = Seventh generation: 900 series = The Roomba 980 was released in September 2015, and contains a new visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) navigation system,\\"Roomba 1,000,000 and 980\\". Leads Rating, January 04, 2017, by Jeremy Jauncey which allows it to clean an entire level of a home more efficiently. The 980 also features Wi-Fi connectivity and an iPhone and Android app. The Roomba 960 was released on August 4, 2016. As of March 29, 2017, 900 series users can receive detailed cleaning maps of their Roomba through the app. The maps show exact areas of clean and dirty spots in the home, allowing the Roomba to know where it needs to spend more time cleaning. However, the maps are not retained between cleaning runs, and each time the Roomba is run it builds a new map from scratch. Push notifications of when the Roomba is finished cleaning is also a new feature. Integration to Amazon's Echo was also announced, launching in spring 2017. = Eighth generation: I series and E series = In September 2018, iRobot introduced a new Roomba series with three models: the premium i7 and i7+ and the more basic e5. The i7 models use the same motor as the 980 but feature updated brush extractors and Imprint Smart Map navigation. This feature retains the map after the Roomba has run, and uses subsequent runs to improve the map. This lets users select which room for Roomba to clean from the iRobot Home app. The i7+ features the Clean Base, a self-emptying base that empties the Roomba's bin when it docks using a powerful vacuum. iRobot claims that the base can empty the Roomba's bin up to 30 cleaning cycles. The Clean Base uses a disposable bag. The basic e5 Roomba replaces the 800 series with an improved battery life from 60 to 90 minutes of run time on hardwood floors using a lithium-ion battery. = Ninth generation: S series = In late May 2019, iRobot introduced the Roomba s9 and s9+ as the \\"smartest, most powerful robot vacuum yet\\". The S series features a newly designed \\"D\\" shape and corner brush for optimized edge cleaning deep into corners and along edges. Other new features include an anti-allergen system that traps 99% of pollen, mold and allergens, compared to the 600 series, 30% wider rubber brushes, and the most advanced navigation system to date. Similar to the I series, the s9+ comes with the self-emptying Clean Base. The S series also includes linking technology that allows the Roomba to communicate wirelessly with other iRobot products, where the Braava Jet M6 can automatically be set to mop after the s9 has finished vacuuming.  Hacking and extending Roomba  A hacked Roomba drawing a Spirograph-like pattern From the earliest models on, Roomba vacuum cleaning robots have been hacked to extend their functionality. The first adaptations were based on a microcontroller that was directly connected to the motor drivers and sensors. Versions manufactured after October 2005 contain an electronic and software interface that allows hackers to more easily control or modify behavior and remotely monitor its sensors. One early application was using the device to map a room. The native code for Roomba is written in a dialect of Lisp. Models with an interface (400 series since October 2007 plus 500 and 700 series) come with a Mini-DIN connector supporting a serial interface, which is electrically and physically incompatible with standard PC/Mac serial ports and cables. However, third-party adapters are available to access the Roomba's computer via Bluetooth, USB, or RS-232 (PC/Mac serial). Roombas pre-October 2005 upgraded with the OSMO hacker device allow monitoring many sensors and modifying the unit's behavior. The Roomba Open Interface (OI, formerly Roomba Serial Command Interface) allows programmers and roboticists to create their own enhancements. Several projects are described on Roomba hacking sites. In response to the growing interest of hackers in their product, the company developed the iRobot Create. In this model the vacuum cleaner motor is replaced by a \\"cargo bay\\" for mounting devices like TV cameras, lasers and other robotic parts.

Peters' book popularized the term \\"blue laws\\", referring to laws restricting activities on Sunday. Background Peters was an Anglican priest hostile to the cause of American independence and had been forced to flee to London in late 1774, shortly before the Revolutionary War began; he made up 45 harsh laws as a hoax to discredit America as backwards and fanatical, and in 1781 published them in a book called A General History of Connecticut, which contains numerous other tall tales. According to Peters the blue laws \\"were never suffered to be printed\\", but especially in the 19th century they were confused with the Code of 1650 of the colonists of Connecticut and with the statutes drafted in 1655 by Governor Theophilus Eaton for the then unconnected Colony of New Haven, for which he drew on the writings of the Reverend John Cotton and the laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and which were printed in London in blue covers for the use of the colonists. Peters was probably the first to popularize the term \\"blue laws\\". Its etymology is unclear, but he implied a relationship to the expletive \\"bloody\\", saying that they \\"were very properly termed Blue Laws, i.e. Bloody Laws, for they were all sanctified with excommunication, confiscation, fines, banishment, whippings, cutting off the ears, burning the tongue, and death.\\" Supposed Connecticut Blue Laws #The Governor and Magistrates convened in general Assembly, are the supreme power under God of this independent Dominion. # From the determination of the Assembly no appeal shall be made. # The Governor is amenable to the voice of the people. #The Governor shall have only a single vote in determining any question; except a casting vote, when the Assembly may be equally divided. #The Assembly of the People shall not be dismissed by the Governor, but shall dismiss itself. #Conspiracy against this Dominion shall be punished with death. #Whoever says there is power and jurisdiction above and over this Dominion, shall suffer death and loss of property. #Whoever attempts to change or overturn this Dominion, shall suffer death. #The judges shall determine controversies without a jury #No one shall be a freeman, or give a vote, unless he be converted, and a member in full communion of one of the Churches allowed in this Dominion. #No man shall hold any office, who is not sound in the faith, and faithful to this Dominion; and whoever gives a vote to such a person, shall pay a fine of ¬£1; for a second offence, he shall be disfranchised. #Each freeman shall swear by the blessed God to bear true allegiance to this Dominion, and that Jesus Christ is the only King. #No quaker or dissenter from the established worship of this Dominion shall be allowed to give a vote for the election of Magistrates, or any officer. #No food or lodging shall be afforded to a Quaker, Adamite, or other Heretic. #If any person turns Quaker, he shall be banished, and not suffered to return but upon pain of death. #No Priest shall abide in this Dominion: he shall be banished, and suffer death on his return.

He is best known for his writings about California politics and culture, including the condition of migrant farm workers and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. From 1955 to 1975, he edited The Nation magazine. Early years McWilliams was born December 13, 1905 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. He first came to California in 1922, after a collapse in the cattle market ruined his father's health and his family's finances. McWilliams attended the University of Southern California from which he obtained a law degree in 1927.Francis X. Gannon, Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume 1. Boston: Western Islands Publishers, 1969; pp. 452‚Äì454. From 1927 to 1938, McWilliams practiced law in Los Angeles at Black, Hammock & Black. Some of his cases, including his defense of striking Mexican citrus workers, prefigured his later writing. During the 1920s and early 1930s, McWilliams joined a loose network of mostly Southern California writers that included Robinson Jeffers, John Fante, Louis Adamic, and Upton Sinclair. His literary career also benefited greatly from his relationships with Mary Austin and H.L. Mencken. Mencken provided an outlet for McWilliams's early journalism and floated the idea for his first book, a 1929 biography of popular writer and sometime Californian Ambrose Bierce. Political activity The Depression and the rise of European fascism in the 1930s radicalized McWilliams. He began working with left-wing political and legal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild. He also wrote for Pacific Weekly, Controversy, The Nation, and other progressive magazines. He continued to represent workers in and around Los Angeles, helped organize unions and guilds, and served as a trial examiner for the new National Labor Relations Board. His first bestseller, Factories in the Field, appeared in 1939 and ranks among his most enduring works. Published within months of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, it examines the lives of migrant farm workers in California and condemns the politics and consequences of California agricultural land monopoly and large-scale agribusiness. Shortly before its publication, McWilliams accepted an offer from incoming Governor Culbert Olson to head California's Division of Immigration and Housing. Over his four-year term (1938-1942), he focused on improving agricultural working conditions and wages, but his hopes for major reform deteriorated with the advent of World War II. During the 1940s, McWilliams lived in Echo Park, California, a neighborhoodhttp://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/region/central-la/ of Los Angeles. He owned his home at 2041 Alvarado Street until the 1970s, well after he moved to New York in 1951. McWilliams left his government post in 1942, when incoming Governor Earl Warren promised campaign audiences that his first official act would be to fire him. McWilliams was a sharp critic of Warren, whom he described as \\"the personification of Smart Reaction,\\" but he became an enthusiastic admirer after Warren joined the US Supreme Court the following decade. No such conversion occurred in his attitude toward another California politician, Richard Nixon, whom McWilliams described in 1950 as \\"a dapper little man with an astonishing capacity for petty malice.\\" After leaving the state government, McWilliams continued to write prolifically. He turned his attention to issues of racial and ethnic equality, writing a series of important books (including Brothers Under the Skin, Prejudice, North from Mexico, and A Mask for Privilege) that dealt with the treatment of immigrant and minority groups. He also produced two regional portraits, Southern California Country: An Island on the Land (1946, American Folkways series) and California: The Great Exception (1949), which many aficionados still regard as the finest interpretive histories of those areas. Decades after its publication, Southern California Country inspired Robert Towne's Oscar-winning original screenplay for Chinatown (1974). Accusations of communist sympathies Witch Hunt (1950) was an early attempt to combat McCarthyism, which McWilliams considered a grave threat to civil liberties and healthy politics. Although he was never a member of the Communist Party, he was a frequent target of anticommunist attacks. In the 1940s, he was called before the Committee on Un-American Activities in California. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover placed him on the Custodial Detention List, making him a candidate for detention in case of national emergency even though McWilliams was serving in the state government at the time. His activism took many forms. In the early 1940s, he helped overturn the convictions of mostly Latino youths following the so-called Sleepy Lagoon murder trial. He also helped cool the city's temperature during the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943, when scuffles between servicemen and Latino youths spun out of control. Once out of government, he became an outspoken critic of the removal and internment of Japanese American citizens and almost immediately began writing an expos√© on the topic. Published in 1944, Prejudice: Japanese-Americans: Symbol of Race Hatred was cited repeatedly in the sole dissenting opinion in Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion. Several years later, a group of Los Angeles screenwriters, directors, and producers known as the Hollywood Ten was cited for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer a House committee's questions about Communist Party membership. McWilliams drafted a Supreme Court amicus brief for two of them, John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo. (The Court declined to hear their appeal.) In 1951, McWilliams moved to New York City to work at The Nation under editor Freda Kirchwey. For the next decade, he helped shepherd the magazine through its most difficult period. Taking over as editor in 1955, he stayed until 1975 and is credited with strengthening the magazine's investigative reporting. He also published the early work of Ralph Nader, Howard Zinn, Theodore Roszak, and Hunter S. Thompson, who credited McWilliams with the idea for his first bestselling book, Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga (1966). McWilliams and Bay of Pigs story McWilliams was the first American reporter to reveal that the CIA was training a group of Cuban exiles in Guatemala for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.Carey McWilliams, The Education of Carey McWilliams 228 (Simon & Schuster 1978). His article for The Nation, \\"Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas?\\", was published in November 1960, five months before the invasion occurred, during the Eisenhower Administration.Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas?, 191 The Nation 378 (November 19, 1960). The story was largely ignored by major newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post.Montague Kern et al., The Kennedy Crises: The Press, The Presidency and Foreign Policy 105-06 (Univ. of N.C. Press 1983). Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., an aide to President John F. Kennedy, pressured The New Republic not to run a story about the guerrilla force.Id. Following the failure of the invasion, Kennedy expressed regret that more information about the invasion plan was not published by telling Times reporter Turner Catledge, \\"If you had printed more about the operation, you would have saved us from a colossal mistake.\\"Carey McWilliams, The Education of Carey McWilliams 229 (Simon & Schuster 1978). Death and legacy He died in New York City on June 27, 1980, at 74.Online Archive of California Since his death, his critical fortunes have risen steadily. The American Political Science Association gives an annual Carey McWilliams Award \\"to honor a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics.\\" In Embattled Dreams (2002), California historian Kevin Starr calls McWilliams \\"the single finest nonfiction on California‚Äìever,\\" and biographer Peter Richardson maintains that McWilliams might be the most versatile American public intellectual of the twentieth century. His first son, Wilson Carey McWilliams, was a noted political scientist who taught at Rutgers University. His second son, Jerry McWilliams, was an expert on vinyl disc records preservation. McWilliams had two grandchildren: Susan McWilliams Barndt, a professor of politics at Pomona College, and Helen McWilliams, the lead singer of VAGIANT Boston. His papers are housed in the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley and at Special Collections at the University of California, Los Angeles.

It can be denoted by the symbols NH3(aq). Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests an alkali with composition [NH4+][OH‚àí], it is actually impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions NH4+ and OH‚àí do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions. Basicity of ammonia in water In aqueous solution, ammonia deprotonates a small fraction of the water to give ammonium and hydroxide according to the following equilibrium: : NH3 \\\\+ H2O NH4+ \\\\+ OH‚àí. In a 1 M ammonia solution, about 0.42% of the ammonia is converted to ammonium, equivalent to pH = 11.63 because [NH4+] = 0.0042 M, [OH‚àí] = 0.0042 M, [NH3] = 0.9958 M, and pH = 14 + log10[OH‚àí] = 11.62. The base ionization constant is : Kb = [NH4+][OH‚àí] / [NH3] = 1.8. Saturated solutions Like other gases, ammonia exhibits decreasing solubility in solvent liquids as the temperature of the solvent increases. Ammonia solutions decrease in density as the concentration of dissolved ammonia increases. At , the density of a saturated solution is 0.88 g/ml and contains 35.6% ammonia by mass, 308 grams of ammonia per litre of solution, and has a molarity of approximately 18 mol/L. At higher temperatures, the molarity of the saturated solution decreases and the density increases. Upon warming saturated solutions, ammonia gas is released. Applications In contrast to anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia finds few non-niche uses outside of cleaning agents. = Household cleaner = Diluted (1‚Äì3%) ammonia is also an ingredient of numerous cleaning agents, including many window cleaning formulas. Because aqueous ammonia is a gas dissolved in water, as the water evaporates from a window, the gas evaporates also, leaving the window streak-free. In addition to use as an ingredient in cleansers with other cleansing ingredients, ammonia in water is also sold as a cleaning agent by itself, usually labeled as simply \\"ammonia\\". It may be sold plain, lemon- scented (and typically colored yellow), or pine-scented (green). Commonly available ammonia with soap added is known as \\"cloudy ammonia\\". = Alkyl amine precursor= In industry, aqueous ammonia can be used as a precursor to some alkyl amines, although anhydrous ammonia is usually preferred. Hexamethylenetetramine forms readily from aqueous ammonia and formaldehyde. Ethylenediamine forms from 1,2-dichloroethane and aqueous ammonia. = Absorption refrigeration = In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the vapor compression cycle it lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Both the Electrolux refrigeratorVapour Absorption Cycle - Domestic Electrolux Refrigerator and the Einstein refrigerator are well known examples of this application of the ammonia solution. = Water treatment = Ammonia is used to produce monochloramine, which is used as a disinfectant. Chloramine is preferred over chlorination for its ability to remain active in stagnant water pipes longer, reducing the risk of waterborne infections. Ammonia is used by aquarists for the purposes of setting up a new fish tank using an ammonia process called fishless cycling. This application requires that the ammonia contain no additives. = Food production = Baking ammonia (ammonium bicarbonate) was one of the original chemical leavening agents. It was obtained from deer antlers. It is useful as a leavening agent, because ammonium carbonate is heat activated. This characteristic allows bakers to avoid both yeast's long proofing time and the quick CO2 dissipation of baking soda in making breads and cookies rise. It is still used to make ammonia cookies and other crisp baked goods, but its popularity has waned because of ammonia's off-putting smell and concerns over its use as a food ingredient compared to modern-day baking powder formulations. It has been assigned E number E527 for use as a food additive in the European Union. Aqueous ammonia is used as an acidity regulator to bring down the acid levels in food. It is classified in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when using the food grade version.Database of Select Committee on GRAS Substances (SCOGS) Reviews: Ammonium hydroxide, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Its pH control abilities make it an effective antimicrobial agent. = Furniture darkening = In furniture-making, Ammonia fuming was traditionally used to darken or stain wood containing tannic acid. After being sealed inside a container with the wood, fumes from the ammonia solution react with the tannic acid and iron salts naturally found in wood, creating a rich, dark stained look to the wood. This technique was commonly used during the arts and crafts movement in furniture ‚Äì a furniture style which was primarily constructed of oak and stained using these methods. = Treatment of straw for cattle = Ammonia solution is used to treat straw, producing \\"ammoniated straw\\" making it more edible for cattle.  Laboratory use  Aqueous ammonia is used in traditional qualitative inorganic analysis as a complexant and base. Like many amines, it gives a deep blue coloration with copper(II) solutions. Ammonia solution can dissolve silver oxide residues, such as that formed from Tollens' reagent. It is often found in solutions used to clean gold, silver, and platinum jewelry, but may have adverse effects on porous gem stones like opals and pearls.The Jeweler's Bench. 2015.

The project entails the construction of a demonstration power plant at Koeberg near Cape Town (now postponed indefinitelyhttp://www.world-nuclear- news.org/NN-PBMR_postponed-1109092.html World Nuclear News 11 September 2009) and a fuel plant at Pelindaba near Pretoria.  Reactor design  The PBMR is characterised by inherent safety features, which mean that no human error or equipment failure can cause an accident that would harm the public. Heat from the PBMR can be used for a variety of industrial process applications, including process steam for cogeneration applications, in-situ oil sands recovery, ethanol applications, refinery and petrochemical applications. The high temperature heat can also be used to reform methane to produce syngas (where the syngas can be used as feedstock to produce hydrogen, ammonia and methanol); and to produce hydrogen and oxygen by decomposing water thermochemically. The PBMR is modular in that only small to mid-sized units will be designed. Larger power stations will be built by combining many of these modules. As of 2008, 400MWt was emerging as an optimum module size, considerably larger than the original concept size. The PBMR is fuelled and moderated by graphite fuel spheres each containing TRISO coated low enriched uranium oxide fuel particles. There are 15000 fuel particles per fuel sphere the size of a billiard ball. \\"Each fuel pebble contains 9 g of uranium, and this holds enough generation capacity to sustain a family of four, for a year. Five tons of coal and up to 23 000 m3 of water will be required to generate one pebble's energy.‚Äù The concept is based on the AVR reactor and THTR in Germany, but modified to drive a Brayton closed-cycle gas turbine.IAEA Technical Committee Meeting on ‚ÄúGas Turbine Power Conversion Systems for Modular HTGRs‚Äù, held from 14‚Äì16 November 2000 in Palo Alto, California.

PBMR (Pty) Ltd  Since its establishment in 1994, Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (Pty) Ltd grew into one of the largest nuclear reactor design teams in the world. In addition to the core team of some 700 people at the PBMR head-office in Centurion near Pretoria, more than 600 people at universities, private companies and research institutes were involved with the project. In 2009 PBMR (Pty) announced that it was looking at employing the technology for process heat applications, and some pebble bed reactor contracts had been put on hold to prevent unnecessary spending In early 2010 the South Africa government announced it had stopped funding the development of the pebble bed modular reactor, and PBMR (Pty) stated it was considering 75% cuts in staff. The decision was taken because no customer or investor for PBMR was found. Unresolved technical items, a substantial increase of costs and a 2008 report from Forschungszentrum J√ºlich about major problems in operation of the German pebble bed reactor AVR had discouraged potential investors. International banks refused to support the PBMR project by loans. PBMR's CEO resigned on March, 8th 2010. In future, the South African nuclear program will concentrate on conventional light water reactors. On 25 May 2010 the company announced to staff that it intends to implement a \\"Care and Maintenance\\" Strategy. This involves the reduction of staff to 9. The stated purpose of the proposed structure is; preserve PBMR as a legal entity, preserve and optimise IP, preserve HTR license, preserve assets and solicit new investors. The strategy assumes that keeping on 9 employees in the medium term will leave sufficient funding to take PBMR to March 2013. The remaining employees will serve to end of October 2010. Some funding is foreseen for dismantling of the PBMR fuel fabrication laboratories in 2011. In 2006, the US Department of Energy awarded the PBMR consortium the primary contract for the first phase of its New Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project. The scope for the first phase of this contract, which has now been completed, was for the pre-conceptual engineering of a nuclear co- generation plant for the production of electricity and hydrogen. Requests for proposals for the second phase of the NGNP project will soon be issued, to which the PBMR consortium will be responding within the next few months of 2009. In May 2010 Westinghouse withdrew from the PBMR consortium, which led to an end of the South African engagement in NGNP. The NGNP project will continue on HTGRs with prismatic fuel elements, not with pebbles as in PBMR, as was announced in February 2012. R9.244 billion (US$1.3 billion) had been invested in the PBMR project. Over 80% came from the South African government, with smaller amounts from Eskom (8.8%), Westinghouse (4.9%), Industrial Development Corporation (4.9%) and Exelon (1.1%).

Schlesisches Tor U1 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn, which is long and has 13 stations. Its traditional line designation was BII. It runs east‚Äìwest and its eastern terminus is Warschauer Stra√üe S-Bahn station where it connects to the Schlesische Bahn. From there it runs through Kreuzberg via Gleisdreieck and Wittenbergplatz on to the Kurf√ºrstendamm. The eastern section of the line is the oldest part of the Berlin U-Bahn, although it is largely above ground.  Nomenclature  The U1 route was originally part of BII until 1957, where it was renamed to BIV until 1 March 1966. While the main section between Wittenbergplatz and Schlesisches Tor has been designated as line 1 since 1966, the western end of the line has changed twice. It was consequently renumbered to Line \\"3\\" and \\"U3\\" in 1993, before being renamed U15 until 2004.  History  The increasing traffic problems in Berlin at the end of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for overhead conveyors, such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens' suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstrasse, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers. The original route Finally, after many years and negotiations, Siemens proposal for an elevated railway line from Warschauer Br√ºcke via Hallesches Tor to B√ºlowstra√üe was approved. This was only possible, however, because it passed through poor areas. The richer residents of Leipziger Stra√üe pressed the city administration to prevent the line using their street. Siemens & Halske carried out all construction work and also owned the line. The first sod was turned on 10 September 1896 in Gitschiner Stra√üe. The construction work had to be carried out quickly because the contract with the city of Berlin, signed with the granting of the concession, specified that the line had to be finished within two years, or a penalty of 50,000 marks would be payable. The railway engineers developed a design for the supporting columns for the elevated railway, but it was unpopular and the architect Alfred Grenander was asked to submit an artistic solution for this problem. For the next 30 years Grenander was the house architect for the elevated and underground railway. After tough negotiations with the city of Charlottenburg it was decided to extend the line to Knie along the Tauentzienstrasse, but instead of being elevated it would be a subsurface (cut-and-cover) railway. The management of the city of Berlin board of works regarded the idea of an underground railway sympathetically. Since the underground caused no apparent damage to the new sewer, an underground branch could be built from a junction at Gleisdreieck (German for \\"rail triangle\\") to Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's then city centre. The national government granted permission for the planning changes on 1 November 1900. The B√ºlowstra√üe elevated station in 1903 The total length of the elevated and underground railway was now . The largest part of the route, approximately , would be established on viaducts and connect eleven elevated stations. In addition there would be of underground line with three underground stations. The planners believed that 8-carriage trains would not be needed and therefore designed it with 80 m-long (260 ft) platforms, sufficient only for 6-carriage trains. The first of the line was finished in 1901 and on 15 February 1902 the first train ran on the line from Potsdamer Platz to Zoologischer Garten, then to Stralauer Tor and back to Potsdamer Platz. This allowed many prominent Berliners to participate in the opening trip, including the Prussian minister for public works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 the first stage of the Berlin U-Bahn was officially opened (Stralauer Tor‚ÄìPotsdamer Platz). In March the line was extended to Zoologischer Garten and on 17 August it was extended by 380 m from Stralauer Tor to Warschauer Br√ºcke. There were at that time only two lines: *From Warschauer Br√ºcke to Zoologischer Garten via Potsdamer Platz (with reversal). *From Warschauer Br√ºcke directly to Zoologischer Garten. On 14 December the line was extended to Knie. The section between Gleisdreieck and Knie (now Ernst-Reuter-Platz) is now part of U2. = U-Bahn to Dahlem and the branch to Uhlandstra√üe = Uhlandstra√üe (U1) In the summer of 1907, the elevated railway company of the new city of Wilmersdorf suggested the building of an underground line to the Wilmersdorf area. It suggested a line to N√ºrnberger Platz and, if Wilmersdorf would pay for it, to Breitenbachplatz. Since Wilmersdorf municipality had poor transport connections, the Wilmersdorf city fathers were pleased to take up this suggestion. The royal domain of Dahlem, which was south of Wilmersdorf and was still undeveloped, also supported a U-bahn connection and wanted it extended from Breitenbachplatz to Thielplatz. However, the future line would run partly through the city of Charlottenburg, which saw the city of Wilmersdorf as a major competitor for the settlement of wealthy ratepayers. Long negotiations ensued, until finally in the summer 1910 a solution was found: an additional line would be built under the Kurf√ºrstendamm to Uhlandstra√üe. Work began on these lines in the same summer. Eastern entrance of Uhlandstra√üe U-Bahn station The double-track Wittenbergplatz station, which only had two side platforms, had to be completely rebuilt. The new station required five platforms with a sixth prepared for development and an entrance hall. The cities of Wilmersdorf and Charlottenburg submitted many suggestions for its design. Finally the house architect of the elevated railway company, Alfred Grenander, was appointed to design the station on the recommendation of the royal police chief. The additional line to Uhlandstra√üe branched at Wittenbergplatz and had no intervening stations, but it was intended to be extended to Halensee. Nevertheless, the only addition to the line has been the building in 1961 of the Kurf√ºrstendamm interchange station with the U9. It is still planned to extend the line to the west and preparations were made for it in the building of Internationales Congress Centrum on Neuen Kantstra√üe. In addition provisions have been made for a U1 station under the U7 station at Adenauerplatz. After a relatively short construction period the Kurf√ºrstendamm line, as it was called, was opened together with the Dahlem line on 12 October 1913. The length of the additional lines totaled about . These were the last sections of the Berlin U-Bahn built before World War I. = The new Gleisdreieck = Gleisdreieck lower platform ‚Äì today the U2 stops here One of the most dangerous places of the entire U-Bahn network was found at the triangular rail junction at Gleisdreieck, which connected the main route between Warschauer Br√ºcke and Zoologischer Garten with the branch line to Potsdamer Platz. This branch was protected only by signals, so that train- driver inattention could easily lead to a disaster, as happened on 26 September 1908. A U-Bahn train ran into the side of another train, forcing two carriages off the track. One carriage fell over the viaduct and 21 passengers died. As a result, it was decided to change the configuration at Gleisdreieck. Construction began in May 1912 to replace the rail triangle with two lines built as a grade-separated cross with a new Gleisdreieck interchange station at the intersection. These lines now form part of U1 and U2. The new works were carried out largely with full services operating, although services were briefly interrupted on each line. On 3 November 1912 the new Gleisdreieck station was opened but construction was not completed until August 1913. The connecting track from the Pankow direction to the Warschauer Stra√üe direction continued to operate until the completion of works for construction supply vehicles. =Last small profile U-Bahn opened= Nollendorfplatz station The small profile network was only slightly extended during the Weimar Republic. The new arrangement at Gleisdreieck was completed. The additional line created by the conversion of the three way junction to a cross at Gleisdreieck was extended under Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe to Nollendorfplatz and was opened on 24 October 1926 together with the rebuilt Nollendorfplatz station. The basic fit- out of the Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe station bears witness to the difficult financial times. As part of this work, the Nollendorfplatz station was completely rebuilt to incorporate the Sch√∂neberg line (now U4), which had continued to be independently operated after its take over by the city of Berlin in 1920. The new Nollendorfplatz station has two underground platforms, one below the other and looking identical. The Sch√∂neberg line ends on the higher level across the platform from trains coming from Wittenbergplatz. Trains run from the lower level to Sch√∂neberg and Wittenbergplatz, also allowing cross-platform transfers. The elevated station of today's U2 remained completely unchanged. Its impressive dome was destroyed in World War II and a simplified dome was only re-established on the U-Bahn's 100-year anniversary in 2002. = Kurf√ºrstendamm station = The new Berlin sector administration in West Berlin focussed on the reconstruction of buses and trams starting in the late 1940s. It also recognised that the densely populated districts of Steglitz, Wedding and Reinickendorf needed a rail connection to the then redeveloping centre around Zoologischer Garten. This could not be achieved however with line extensions and a new line was necessary. Therefore, it was proposed to build line G (now U9) from central Wedding, near Osloer Stra√üe, through Moabit, the centre of West Berlin, near Zoo and Kurf√ºrstendamm, the Bundesallee and the Schlo√üstra√üe to Rathaus Steglitz. This line was the third north south line, after lines C (U6) and D (U8). In addition a new station would be built at the intersection of the new built line with the then U3 (now U1). Instead of building the station with services operating, the ‚Äústub line‚Äù was simply shut down so that the rail interchange could be built under the crossing of Joachimstaler Stra√üe and Kurf√ºrstendamm. Line G was due to be opened on 2 September 1961, but on 13 August the GDR government commenced building the Berlin Wall, making the line even more needed. Therefore, the opening date was brought forward to 28 August. = Fall of the wall and reunification of the networks = Since 1995 the U-Bahn runs again over the Oberbaumbr√ºcke After the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and German reunification on 3 October 1990, it was also necessary to combine the two U-Bahn networks of the east and west again. When line U2 started running through in 1993, line U1 still ended at Schlesisches Tor station, where it had terminated since August 1961. The first reconstruction work on the line began in 1992. Numerous repairs had to be made and new buildings were necessary because some station buildings had been demolished during the GDR era. The Oberbaumbr√ºcke was also in a very run-down condition. The Spanish architect, Santiago Calatrava drew up the plans for rebuilding the bridge. The station with its three platforms, the old signal tower, and the carriage shed in Rudolfstrasse all required repairs. After construction was completed, the first train ran on 14 October 1995 to Warschauer Stra√üe (formerly called Warschauer Br√ºcke, but renamed after the nearby S-Bahn station). There are plans for the U-Bahn station to be moved closer to the S-Bahn station, but due to financial constraints this would not happen before 2015.https://www.welt.de/print- welt/article192078/Warschauer_Strasse_Mehr_als_50_000_Fahrgaeste_taeglich.html = Planning = U-Bahn train crosses the Oberbaum Bridge, December 2014 In the east, an extension to the northeast to Frankfurter Tor (U5) has been planned since the 1920s, via Kopernikusstra√üe, but is not likely to be implemented for some time. It may have potential extensions to Forckenbeckplatz and Storkower Stra√üe, whereas another extension is also underway to Hausburgstra√üe and Landsberger Allee. The Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plans has been revived to allow the U1 to be extended to Ostkreuz, which increases the significance of Ostkreuz being a transit hub. In the west, there are long- term plans to extend the line to Westkreuz via Schl√ºterstra√üe and Adenauerplatz (U7) and a new station at Kracauer Platz, instead of continuing the line to Halensee. The advantage would be the connection to the Ring- and Stadtbahn, whereas in Halensee, only the Ringbahn would connect. A line to Halensee could replace several bus lines. Westkreuz is almost only a station to change trains, as there is very limited passenger potential in the vicinity. Zukunft Mobilit√§t (german) While older plans for a continuation to Theodor-Heuss-Platz would create a line with above average passenger numbers, costs might be prohibitive compared to smaller and shorter alternatives.

U2 sign at Ernst-Reuter Platz The U2 has 29 stations and a length of . Together with the U1, U3, and U4 lines, it was part of the early Berlin U-Bahn network built before 1914. The line between Potsdamer Platz and Zoologischer Garten was the western section of the \\"stem line\\" (Stammstrecke), Berlin's first U-Bahn line opened in 1902. Gleisdreieck higher platform - today the U1 and the U3 stop here Zoologischer Garten station, looking towards Ruhleben Overview The line starts to the west of central Berlin at Ruhleben and runs on an embankment between Rominter Allee and the railway to Spandau (also called the \\"Olympic\\" or \\"Grunewald\\" railway). On the bend approaching Olympischen Stra√üe, the line descends into tunnel to run beneath that road. Subsequently, the U2 swings onto Reichsstrasse to Theodor-Heuss-Platz, where it runs in a curve to Kaiserdamm. Under Kaiserdamm, which becomes Bismarckstra√üe at Sophie Charlotte-Platz, the tunnel runs straight to Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here again, it swings to the southeast, following the course of Hardenberger Stra√üe towards Zoologischer Garten station. In the tunnel, it passes the foundations of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on a tight arc and then follows Tauentzienstra√üe to Wittenbergplatz where the line emerges to an elevated section via a ramp east of the Kleiststra√üe/Courbierestra√üe intersection. The elevated railway reaches its full height at Nollendorfplatz station where all four lines of the small- profile network meet. The underground part of the station has four tracks. The U2 continues above ground to the east of B√ºlowstra√üe. After that the U2 makes a curve over a long viaduct at the southernmost point of the line, passes through Gleisdreieck station and then runs straight across the Landwehr Canal and returns underground between Mendelssohn Bartholdy-Park and Potsdamer Platz stations. While the elevated railway company intended to continue the line along Leipziger Stra√üe, it was not permitted to build this route and instead it continues instead along Mohrenstra√üe, Markgrafenstra√üe and Niederwallstra√üe to the River Spree in Berlin Mitte. After passing M√§rkisches Museum station, it goes under the River Spree in a tunnel, and runs through Klosterstra√üe to Alexanderplatz station. After leaving Alexanderplatz, the line turns under Rosa-Luxemburg-Stra√üe and through Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz station. The line then runs north underneath Sch√∂nhauser Allee and through Senefelderplatz station. Before reaching Eberswalder Stra√üe station, the line emerges from tunnel and on to an elevated viaduct through to Sch√∂nhauser Allee station, an interchange with the S-Bahn. From there the line runs beyond the former city limits and the elevated railway descends again into a tunnel to Vinetastra√üe before reaching the terminus at Pankow.  Route numbering  Since the introduction of the schematic line network plans at the Berlin subway, at least parts of today's line U2 always had the colour red. When letters were introduced as a line name after the First World War, the small profile network received the letters \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". The inner city route, more important than the older route through Kreuzberg, became line A, as did the two western branches to Charlottenburg and Dahlem (today's U2 and U3 lines). The routes from Kurf√ºrstendamm and Sch√∂neberg through Kreuzberg to Warschauer Stra√üe (today: U1 and U4) were given the letter \\"B\\" and the colour code green. To distinguish the branches in the western part of the line, the letters were supplemented by Roman numbers, the Charlottenburg route was thus the line AI. From 1966, the designation of the lines operated by the Berlin public transport companies (BVG West / BVG) in West Berlin was converted to Arabic numbers. Each line was now operated independently and without branching. The (\\"green\\") line 1 now ran from Ruhleben through Charlottenburg to Kreuzberg, while the previous AII became the (\\"red\\") line 2 (Krumme Lanke ‚Äì Gleisdreieck, from 1972 only to Wittenbergplatz). The severed eastern line section, used since 1949 by the BVG East / BVB, retained the \\"A\\" line designation unchanged, as well as the red colour code. On 9 January 1984, the BVG also took over the S-Bahn lines in West Berlin previously managed by Deutsche Reichsbahn. The marking of the U-Bahn lines operated by the BVG changed again because the U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines were now operated in parallel. To better distinguish the two networks, the respective Arabic numbers, which had been used since 1966, were prefixed with the letter \\"U\\" to provide a line number. According to the model of public transport networks, which were used in various cities (Frankfurt, Shanghai, Munich, Beijing, Guangzhou) they were then designated as U1 to U9 and similarly the acquired S-Bahn routes were preceded by \\"S\\". With the merging of Berlin in the context of German reunification and the reconstruction of the disused Wittenbergplatz‚ÄìMohrenstra√üe section in 1993, the BVG decided to swap the western branches of lines U1 and U2, which meet at Wittenbergplatz. The reunited former AI line has since been operated under the new name \\"U2\\", but using the traditional red line colour as previously used in the separate parts of the city.  History  The original route The B√ºlowstra√üe elevated station in 1903 air raid in November 1943. The increasing traffic problems in Berlin at the end of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for overhead conveyors, such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens' suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstra√üe, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers. Finally, after many years and negotiations, Siemens proposal for an elevated railway line from Warschauer Br√ºcke via Hallesches Tor to B√ºlowstra√üe was approved. This was only possible, however, because it passed through poor areas. The richer residents of Leipziger Stra√üe pressed the city administration to prevent the line using their street. Siemens & Halske carried out all construction work and also owned the line. The first sod was turned on 10 September 1896 in Gitschiner Stra√üe. The construction work had to be carried out quickly because the contract with the city of Berlin, signed with the granting of the concession, specified that the line had to be finished within two years, or a penalty of 50,000 marks would be payable. The railway engineers developed a design for the supporting columns for the elevated railway, but it was unpopular and the architect Alfred Grenander was asked to submit an artistic solution for this problem. For the next 30 years Grenander was the house architect for the elevated and underground railway. After tough negotiations with the city of Charlottenburg it was decided to extend the line to Knie along the Tauentzienstra√üe, but instead of being elevated it would be a subsurface (cut-and-cover) railway. The management of the city of Berlin board of works regarded the idea of an underground railway sympathetically. Since the underground caused no apparent damage to the new sewer, an underground branch could be built from a junction at Gleisdreieck (German for \\"rail triangle\\") to Potsdamer Platz, Berlin‚Äôs then city centre. The national government granted permission for the planning changes on 1 November 1900. The total length of the elevated and underground railway was now . The largest part of the route, approximately , would be established on viaducts and connect eleven elevated stations. In addition there would be of underground line with three underground stations. The planners believed that 8-carriage trains would not be needed and therefore designed it with 80 m-long platforms, sufficient only for 6-carriage trains. The first of the line was finished in 1901 and on 15 February 1902 the first train ran on the line from Potsdamer Platz to Zoologischer Garten, then to Stralauer Tor and back to Potsdamer Platz. This allowed many prominent Berliners to participate in the opening trip, including the Prussian minister for public works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 the first stage of the Berlin U-Bahn was officially opened (Stralauer Tor‚ÄìPotsdamer Platz). In March the line was extended to Zoologischer Garten and on 17 August it was extended by 380 m from Stralauer Tor to Warschauer Br√ºcke. There were at that time only two lines: *From Warschauer Br√ºcke to Zoologischer Garten via Potsdamer Platz (with reversal). *From Warschauer Br√ºcke directly to Zoologischer Garten. On 14 December the line was extended to Knie. The section between Gleisdreieck and Knie (now Ernst-Reuter-Platz) is now part of U2. = Charlottenburg extension = Deutsche Oper station, formerly Bismarckstra√üe Sophie-Charlotte-Platz station After the opening of the original route further plans to extend the three route branches emerged: via Charlottenburg city to Wilhelmplatz (now Richard-Wagner-Platz) and towards Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss Platz), from Potsdamer Platz to the centre of Berlin and via Warschauer Stra√üe to Frankfurter Tor The fastest route negotiations were completed with the young and coming city of Charlottenburg because there was a lot of vacant land that could be developed. The most important negotiating point was to build a route via Charlottenburg Town Hall in Wilhelmsplatz. Here an extension along Berliner Stra√üe (now Otto-Suhr-Allee) would have served, but this was served at the time by the and a parallel line did not seem sensible. Therefore, this line would continue under Bismarckstra√üe to the west and then curve to the town hall. Under the working title of Krumme Stra√üe, the line was initially planned with a station at Bismarckstra√üe (now Deutsche Oper) and a terminus at Wilhelmplatz. The line was opened between Knie and Wilhelmplatz on 14 May 1906. Both U-Bahn lines now ran to Bismarckstra√üe, but only the branch to Potsdamer Platz also ran to Wilhelmsplatz. While this line was under construction, the railway company and the city of Charlottenburg agreed on a branch towards Westend. Therefore, a planning amendment was necessary at the planned station at Bismarckstra√üe, because the line to Westend would branch there. Therefore, the station was built as the first four-track U-Bahn station in Germany. The two inner tracks would be used for the line to Wilhelmsplatz and the outer tracks for the line to Westend. Since the western Charlottenburg area was still completely undeveloped, the line would not generate any profits in its early years. Therefore, the elevated railway company negotiated with the city of Charlottenburg and the other property owners to compensate for the line's deficit. This contract was signed on 23 June 1906. For the line westwards through Charlottenburg, the following stations were to be built: * Bismarckstra√üe (today's: Deutsche Oper) * Sophie-Charlotte-Platz * Kaiserdamm * Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, the terminus) On 16 March 1908, the Emperor Wilhelm II, opened the line, following the \\"ministerial trip\\", the first service on the line. It was officially inaugurated on 29 March 1908. The two existing lines did not continue to Reichskanzlerplatz; instead, a third line was established, operating only between Bismarckstra√üe and Reichskanzlerplatz. Olympia-Stadion station Because of the greatly extended length of the line, a new workshop was desirable as the previous workshop in Rudolfstra√üe (or Warschauer Br√ºcke) was now no longer adequate. Therefore, the elevated railway company sought a suitable site. Since the Prussian forest administration wanted to market its site of the Grunewald profitably, the interests of both partners were met. The railway company bought only 14 hectares of land to build its new operations workshop. At the same time, it undertook, to build an extension of the line to a station at the stadium (now Olympia-Stadion). The elevated railway company received a grant from the Forestry Administration of 200,000 marks to support this project. Services would only be operated there on special occasions. The shell of Neu-Westend station was built with the extension to the stadium station, as there was insufficient traffic to justify completing the station at that time. The new extension was completed on 8 June 1913. The nearby Unterspreewald power station on Wiesendamm in Ruhleben, which was built for the U-Bahn power supply, had already started operation in 1911. = The central line = After the so-called \\"stem line\\" had been extended to Wilhelmplatz (now Richard- Wagner-Platz) in Charlottenburg, the elevated railway company planned to connect the Berlin city centre to the new U-Bahn. The city of Berlin, however, prohibited this because, given the success of the first line, it had made its own plans for the construction of a metro. But the highest decision-maker, the Berlin Police chief, intervened and approved the plans. Hotel Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstra√üe) was given an entrance designed in accordance with its elegant surroundings. The elevated railway company planned to run the new line in a straight line under Leipziger Stra√üe from Potsdamer Platz to Spittelmarkt. The \\"Gro√üe Berliner Stra√üenbahn\\" (Greater Berlin tramway company), which operated a line along this street, prevented the realisation of these plans by threatening claims for damages, with the support of city of Berlin. Spittelmarkt station provides daylight. The negotiating partners finally agreed to a long-term route through Spittelmarkt, Alexanderplatz and Sch√∂nhauser Allee to Nordring station. The plans initially included the stations of Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstra√üe), Friedrichstra√üe (now Stadtmitte), Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt. The line was later to continue via the following stations: Inselbr√ºcke (now M√§rkisches Museum), Klosterstra√üe, Alexanderplatz, Sch√∂nhauser Tor (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz), Senefelderplatz, Danziger Stra√üe (now Eberswalder Stra√üe, an elevated station) and Nordring (now Sch√∂nhauser Allee, an elevated station). As the section of the line through Spittelmarkt would be very complex and expensive due to the need to tunnel under the Spree, the plans provided for a (cheaper) elevated line in Sch√∂nhauser Allee as compensation. Construction began on 15 December 1905. Potsdamer Platz station, which then had side platforms, was demolished to enable the extension. The new Leipziger Platz (now Potsdamer Platz) station was opened 200 metres away on 28 September 1907. Spittelmarkt station was built under Spittelmarkt square in 1908. This lies directly next to the Spree, so the subsoil is very wet. Piled foundations were necessary to prevent the station subsiding. A windowed gallery was built on the Spree. It was closed in the Second World War and only reopened in 2004. The \\"Spittelmarkt line\\" was officially opened on 1 October 1908. There were now four different services on the U-Bahn network, two of which used the new line: * Warschauer Br√ºcke ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Spittelmarkt, and * Wilhelmplatz (Charlottenburg) ‚Äì Wittenbergplatz ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Spittelmarkt. = Construction of elevated line in Sch√∂nhauser Allee = Elevated station at Eberswalder Stra√üe (formerly Dimitroffstra√üe, originally Danziger Stra√üe) In March 1910, construction began on the extension of the \\"Spittelmarkt line\\" (now also called the \\"Centrumslinie\\"‚Äîcentral line) to the north. There were also some challenges here. After the Spittelmarkt station, the line runs along the banks of the Spree. Therefore, a ramp had to be built to pass under the river bed. Inselbr√ºcke (\\"island bridge\\", now M√§rkisches Museum) station was built there at a depth of about six and a half metres. Because the station was so deep, it was built with an impressively high barrel vault that covers the platform, which is rare in Berlin. It and Platz der Luftbr√ºcke station are the only column-free U-Bahn stations in Berlin. Beyond this station, the line crossed under the Spree and swung under Klosterstra√üe, where the station of the same name was located. Since there were plans at the time to build a branch line under Frankfurter Allee, space was left in the middle of the platform area for another track. Today a line runs on a similar route from Alexanderplatz to Frankfurter Allee. The Central line continued from Klosterstrasse to Alexanderplatz. During the building of Alexanderplatz station, care was taken to ensure that stairs to other lines could later be added. The line between Spittelmarkt and Alexanderplatz was opened on 1 July 1913. The line between Alexanderplatz and Wilhelmplatz quickly became the most used U-Bahn line. This extension ran to Sch√∂nhauser Allee. Sch√∂nhauser Tor station (now Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz) was the first station under today's Torstra√üe. Since Sch√∂nhauser Allee was wide enough, there were no problems with the construction of the tunnel. The next station was as Senefelderplatz. Beyond this, a ramp emerges from the tunnel and runs to the former Danziger Stra√üe station (now Eberswalder Stra√üe). As mentioned, this was built as an elevated railway, because the tunnel section at Spittelmarkt was very cost-intensive and the construction of the elevated railway on the broad Sch√∂nhauser Allee was very cheap. After Danziger Stra√üe station there was a longer elevated viaduct to the former Nordring station (now Sch√∂nhauser Allee). There, the existing Ringbahn was crossed, not underground, but on an even higher level. The S-Bahn now runs in a cutting there. This was the terminus of the line. The extension from Alexanderplatz to Nordring was opened just three and a half weeks after the line to Alexanderplatz was opened on 27 July 1913. = The new Gleisdreieck = Gleisdreieck before and after the reconstruction One of the most dangerous places of the entire U-Bahn network was found at the triangular rail junction at Gleisdreieck, which connected the main line between Warschauer Br√ºcke and Zoologischer Garten with the branch line to Potsdamer Platz. This branch was protected only by signals, so that driver inattention could easily lead to a disaster, as happened on 26 September 1908. A U-Bahn train ran into the side of another train, forcing two carriages off the track. One carriage fell over the viaduct and 21 passengers died. As a result, it was decided to change the configuration at Gleisdreieck. Construction began in May 1912 to replace the triangular junction with two lines built as a grade- separated cross with a new Gleisdreieck interchange station at the intersection. These lines now form part of U1 and U2. The new work was carried out largely with full services operating, although services were briefly interrupted on each line. On 3 November 1912, the new Gleisdreieck station was opened but construction was not completed until August 1913. The connecting track from the Pankow direction to the Warschauer Stra√üe direction continued to be open until the completion of work for use by construction supply trains. = Two new termini= The current U2 terminus in Ruhleben Vinetastra√üe station with a class GI train, 1993 The small profile network was only slightly expanded during the Weimar Republic. There has been regular train traffic to Stadion since 1913 and Neu-Westend station, which was already partly built at that time, was finally opened on 22 May 1922. The new Gleisdreieck station was also completed to form a cross; the \\"relief line\\" from Gleisdreieck via Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe to Nollendorfplatz was opened on 24 October 1926. The austere Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe station testifies to the difficult financial situation of that time. Nollendorfplatz station was also completely rebuilt and rearranged as part of the construction of the relief line, since the U-Bahn of the formerly independent city of Sch√∂neberg (today's line U4) was still operated independently, although it was now part of the City of Berlin. The former ‚Äústem line‚Äù from Nordring to Stadion was extended by one station in each direction. Pankow station (now Vinetastra√üe) was built in 1930 to its north. There was one main reason for its construction: trains ran so often to Nordring station that it was not possible to reverse them on the viaduct. It was much easier to provide a reversing facility underground. A further planned extension to Breiten Stra√üe in Pankow or to Pankow S-Bahn station was not built at that time and construction did not recommence until 1997. At the opposite end, the line was extended by one stop to the new terminus of Ruhleben on 22 December 1929. This line ran on an embankment. An extension through a garden and industrial area to nearby Spandau was planned to start a little later. However, the Great Depression and the Second World War prevented these plans from being carried out and the 1929 extension remains the western end of the U2. = Nazism and the Second World War = After the seizure of power of the Nazis two stations on line AI were renamed after people highly regarded by the Nazi party. Reichskanzlerplatz station (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz) was renamed Adolf-Hitler-Platz on 24 April 1933. Sch√∂nhauser Tor station (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) was renamed after SA (\\"Brownshirts\\") Sturmf√ºhrer (lieutenant) Horst Wessel on 1 May 1934. Under the plans to transform Berlin into \\"Germania\\" in 1939, the route of line A at that time would have changed relatively little compared to other plans of the time. In addition to the northern extension to Pankow, referred to in the plans as Pankow (Breite Stra√üe), which had been planned for years, the elevated line at Gleisdreieck was to be dismantled and replaced by a new, underground and direct route to B√ºlowstra√üe. The proposals for an extension to Spandau that were made in previous and later plans were not incorporated. The proposed lines FI and FIII served this purpose. The first tunnel work started at what is now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, but was stopped in 1941. It was intended that work would resume after the predicted \\"final victory\\". After the war began on 1 September 1939, the order was given to all modes of transport to only run with darkened headlights. This affected not only the trains, but also to the S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations‚Äîonly a few lights were left on. In the autumn of 1943, when the Allied bombing of Berlin increased sharply, many people took refuge in U-Bahn stations. The official regulations stated that at the sound of an air raid siren, all U-Bahn stations were to be closed, however this rarely happened and many people mistakenly believed that they were protected from air raids. For example, the entrance to Senefelderplatz station collapsed as a result of a bomb during the raids that occurred on November 3 and 4 in 1943. In 1944, as the air raids continued, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe had trouble keeping the U2 line in operation, as many stations were affected such as Gleisdreieck, Nollendorfplatz, Olympiastadion, Potsdamer Platz, and Klosterstra√üe. In 1945, the situation deteriorated further and the U-Bahn operated only as a shuttle between some stations. The entire U-Bahn came to a standstill on 25 April 1945. Shortly before the end of the Battle of Berlin on 2 May 1945, SS troops blew up the North-South tunnel of the S-Bahn at the Landwehr Canal, which in addition to flooding the S-Bahn tunnel also caused water to flow through connecting passages into the U-Bahn network. Line AI was completely under water between Alexanderplatz and Potsdamer Platz stations and it took a long time to repair the damage. = New beginning after the war = Mohrenstra√üe station (formerly Kaiserhof) was clad with Saalburg marble in 1950 The repair of the U-Bahn network began after the German surrender. On 14 May 1945, the first trains had already begun running in the area around Hermannplatz. The first shuttle trains were able to run on line AI on the section of line between Knie and Kaiserdamm as well as between Kaiserdamm and Ruhleben on 17 May. The stations renamed Reichskanzlerplatz and Sch√∂nhauser Tor during Nazi Germany were returned to their original names. In the following months, further sections were reopened on 18 September trains on line AI between Pankow and Potsdamer Platz and between Gleisdreieck and Ruhleben, while the section between Potsdamer Platz and Gleisdreieck was operated in shuttle mode. = The division of the city and 17 June 1953 = The beginning of the Cold War and its first major escalation, the Berlin Blockade in 1948/1949, caused great uncertainty among Berliners. Many West Berliners avoided East Berlin. This created new traffic flows that bypassed the eastern sector. Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, the operator of the U-Bahn, was split in 1949 into an eastern and a western company. While bus and tram lines now ended at the sector border, the U-Bahn continued to operate in both sectors. Kaiserhof station was returned to operation under the name of Th√§lmannplatz on 18 August 1950, the sixth anniversary of Ernst Th√§lmann‚Äôs death. This made line AI fully operational again. The station in Wilhelmplatz in the heart of the government district was called after the Hotel Kaiserhof, because the name Wilhelmplatz had already been assigned to a U-Bahn station that had been built in Charlottenburg a few years earlier (now called Richard- Wagner-Platz). The wife and daughter of Th√§lmann, Rosa and Irma, attended the opening ceremony and the renaming of the square as Th√§lmannplatz. Since the government of East Germany mainly occupied offices in the old government district of Wilhelmstrasse, it wanted an impressive station. It is unique in Berlin because of its construction in Saalburg marble in the style of the 1950s. The East Berlin press described it as the most beautiful in Berlin. At the beginning of 1953, the Western BVG installed loudspeakers at the last stations in the western sectors, warning of the crossing into the Soviet sector. Turnback facilities were set up at these stations to allow the trains to terminate there if necessary. In addition, the timetable was designed so that when a U-Bahn train ran east, another train ran west at the same time. As a result, the West would lose only a few U-Bahn sets to the East in the event of an incident. This proved itself in June of the same year, when East Berlin workers responded with protests to an increase in the Arbeitsnorm (\\"work norm\\": the quantity of work required to be performed in a shift). News of the 17 June 1953 uprising spread like wildfire across the GDR. About 20,000 strikers demonstrated not only against the norm increases, but also against the general conditions in the country. The BVG East stopped U-Bahn operations and Deutsche Reichsbahn stopped S-Bahn operations at the border at 11 am. The western trains now ended in the new turnback facilities. In total, the West Berlin BVG lost only 18 trains due to the well thought-out timetable. The northern section of line D, including the stations of Voltastra√üe and Gesundbrunnen, which had no connection to the rest of the West network, was closed. The traffic situation returned to normal after a few days after the bloody suppression of the uprising. As a consequence of the experience of 17 June, the Western BVG established a new route of the AII from Krumme Lanke to Kottbusser Tor which was independent of East Berlin, but which was soon abandoned. In addition, the Sch√∂neberg line now ran only as far as Nollendorfplatz, not as previously to Warschauer Br√ºcke. = The construction of the Wall = East-Berlin transport network with the two U-Bahn lines (shown in blue), 1984 The construction of the Berlin Wall to seal off the sector boundary between the two parts of Berlin resulted in line A also being split into two, as it crossed the city from east to west. On the orders of the then GDR Interior Minister Karl Maron, trains on the section of line A (now U2) in East Berlin terminated at Th√§lmannplatz station (now Mohrenstra√üe). Lines C and D (now U6 and U8) of the West Berlin BVG were left alone, but the stations located in the eastern sector were closed (becoming ghost stations). Connections were not allowed from the eastern section of line A and lines C and D or at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz stations. Maron had originally assumed that the West Berlin BVG would terminate their trains on the western section of line A at Potsdamer Platz, but in fact the trains were terminated one stop earlier, at Gleisdreieck. Tracks to allow trains to change direction here had been built in the early 1950s as a precaution. Therefore, the East Berlin BVG used the reversing tracks at Potsdamer Platz and occasionally even ran its trains into West Berlin. The splitting of line A and the closure of those stations on lines C and D under East Berlin completed the split of the unified Berlin public transport network, as the trams and buses had not crossed the sector border since 1953. The Berlin S-Bahn ran throughout Berlin at the direction of the GDR-controlled Deutsche Reichsbahn and therefore never formed part of the unified public transport network. One consequence of the 13 August 1961 crisis was that the S-Bahn was increasingly boycotted in West Berlin. Often the slogans chanted were, \\"The S-Bahn driver pays for the barbed wire\\" or \\"No more pennies for Ulbricht\\". So West Berliners took the U-Bahn, the bus and‚Äîif still available‚Äîthe tram. = Line A (U2) in East Berlin = The split of the U-Bahn network left only two lines under the direction of BVG-Ost. The first was the whole of line E (now U5) from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichsfelde, which was opened in 1930. The second line was the eastern part of the line A, mainly opened through the city centre and to Pankow in 1908‚Äì1913. Both these lines crossed in the center of East Berlin at Alexanderplatz, where there was a connection to the S-Bahn. The other two lines in the district centre were under the control of West BVG. The stations located in the Eastern sector were closed and bricked-up, treated as ghost stations. These stations were patrolled by GDR security forces to stop East Berliners escaping to the West via the U-Bahn. The U-Bahn network played a less important role in East Berlin than in West Berlin. The focus in the East was more on the extensive S-Bahn and tram networks. In 58 years (1930‚Äì1987), only one new U-Bahn station (Tierpark) was built in the eastern part of the city, while the S-Bahn expanded and many new tram lines were built. Plans were made to use the part of line C (now U6) on East Berlin territory and to extend line A through the city centre in a tunnel along the Friedrichstra√üe, but these were not put into action. The stations of Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz, Spittelmarkt, Rosa Luxemburg-Platz and Senefelderplatz were remodelled and given new wall tiles in the 1960s, all for show, as U6 ran through without stopping. In 1987, the stations of Markisches Museum and Klosterstra√üe were remodelled, as part of the rebuilding for the celebration of 750th anniversary of Berlin, with artistic representations of the urban development of historic buses and trams instead of the advertising space that was not required in the socialist economic system. Alexanderplatz station did not change and is still preserved almost in its original condition and Potsdamer Platz, which was unused for 32 years, also did not change. =New Station: Bismarckstra√üe= Due to the S-Bahn boycott and closure of the tram network, the U-Bahn was expanded in West-Berlin. However, this affected only the more modern large- profile network (today's U6 to U9). Construction projects on the small-profile network were limited to the construction of new interchanges on new U-Bahn lines. On the route of today's U2, work of this nature was carried out in 1978 in Charlottenburg between the current stations of Deutsche Oper and Sophie- Charlotte-Platz. During the construction of line 7, a line that connects several district centres with each other outside of the actual city centre, several existing lines were crossed. These included lines 4, 2 (now U3), and 1 (now U2). The intersection of lines 1 and 7 was in Bismarckstra√üe / Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe, 380 metres west of Deutsche Oper station. Despite the short distance between the sites, a new station was built to enable interchange. Before the beginning of work on line 7 and Bismarckstra√üe station, the shuttle line from Deutsche Oper to Richard-Wagner-Platz (called \\"line 5\\" in the timetable) was closed. This connection was replaced by the new line 7. As the already 70-year-old tunnel of Line 1 consisted only of weakly reinforced concrete, the BVG simply removed the existing tunnel and rebuilt it with a completely closed reinforced-concrete frame. After that the station was built as a multi-level structure, connecting to street level. The new line 7 platform was 110 metres long and 11.6 metres wide. In contrast, two uncomfortable side platforms, each of which was 4.5 metres wide, were built for the small-profile line. To enable the construction of a central platform, the tracks would have had to be separated and the line closed for a long time. The new station was opened under the name of Bismarckstra√üe together with the extension of line 7 on 28 April 1978. = Temporary uses of the elevated line =  Flea market, Turkish bazaar and museum tram  Wittenbergplatz and (in the background) Nollendorfplatz, 1988 Museum tram on class TM 33 on the elevated line at Nollendorfplatz, 1987 The line in West Berlin between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz near the border with the East had been disused since the wall was built on 13 August 1961. The section between Wittenbergplatz and Gleisdreieck via Nollendorfplatz and B√ºlowstra√üe was rarely used because it was no longer possible to continue to East Berlin at the time. For economic reasons, operations on that section of line, then designated as line 2, were also discontinued on 1 January 1972. Subsequently trains on line 2 from Krumme Lanke ended at Wittenbergplatz. The unused elevated railway line through the north of Sch√∂neberg was then used temporarily for several purposes. The tunnel from Wittenbergplatz towards Nollendorfplatz was used for reversing trains since there was no other way for trains on line 2 to reverse. A flea market popularly known as the Nolle operated at the elevated station of Nollendorfplatz in 16 decommissioned U-Bahn cars from 1973. There was a new restaurant on the tracks operated by Heini Holl, which was called Zur Nolle. An operation similar to Nollendorfplatz station was built at B√ºlowstra√üe‚Äîthis was where the Berliner Jahrmarkt (funfair) began in 1975. Since this project was unsuccessful, it closed a year later. A new business concept started on 28 May 1978. The U-Tropia ‚Äì Bahnhof der Nationen (station of nations) project was set up in two U-Bahn cars that were no longer required. The cars were equipped with toilets and many things were sold in the station itself. In order to increase the attractiveness of the two markets, the BVG established a shuttle service of museum trams on the elevated railway in August 1978. But U-Tropia closed during the next winter. As no new project had been established at B√ºlowstra√üe station, the shuttle service closed. In September 1980, the T√ºrkischer Basar (Turkish bazaar) project opened at B√ºlowstrasse station. This market was successful and continued until the elevated railway was reopened for U-Bahn traffic. The shuttle service on the elevated railway was discontinued on 28 February 1991.  Test track for automatic train operation  After installing Linienzugbeeinflussung (a cab signalling and train protection system) on the line U9, the SelTrac operating system of SEL was tested without passengers on part of the unused section of the elevated railway from 1977 to 1981. This made it possible to run at an absolute braking distance and thus allowed trains to run closer together. The tracks, excluding the section between the U-Bahn stations of B√ºlowstra√üe and Potsdamer Platz, which was being used for other purposes (markets and storage facilities), were equipped with inductive loops for this experiment. SelTrac equipment was installed on two small profile two-car sets. A system was installed with operations management, a dispatching centre, an operations centre, turnout controls and station facilities. The conductor loops were used to transfer movement authorities and other information, as well as location data. For this purpose, the maximum 3.2 km-long inductive loops intersected every 25 metres.  The M-Bahn  M-Bahn cars, here in the DB Nuremberg Transport Museum in 2006 Bridge over Sch√∂neberger Ufer carrying M-Bahn, 1991 U-Bahn services only operated on the upper platform of Gleisdreieck station used by line 1, while there were no passenger services on the lower level. At the request of the Senate of Berlin, the House of Representatives decided on 2 December 1980 to make available the section of the line that had been used in the automatic SelTrac test mode since 1977 to AEG for Maglev test operations. The Senate planned to convert the small profile network of the U-Bahn to magnetic levitation, but this raised considerable concerns in the BVG. Construction work on the new facilities began in December 1983. In addition to the lower platform of Gleisdreieck station, the stations of Bernburger Stra√üe (roughly at the site of today's Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station) and Kemperplatz were established. The first measured trials on this 1.6 kilometre-long line started a year later. On 19 December 1988, there was an accident at the terminal station of Kemperplatz due to an operating error with the control system when an unoccupied M-Bahn test train went beyond the end of the track, broke through a glass wall and got stuck six metres above the ground. The public was allowed to try out the M-Bahn, as it was called from then on, for free from 28 August 1989. The final approval for the M-Bahn to operate as a new passenger transport system was given by the technical supervisory authority on 18 July 1991. As a result, passengers had to pay the usual BVG tariff for an M-Bahn journey. Just two weeks later, the M-Bahn had to stop operating to make room for construction work to reopen the section of the U2 U-Bahn line that had been closed 30 years earlier. The facilities of the M-Bahn were dismantled and initially stored, as it was intended that they would later be reused for a connection to Sch√∂nefeld Airport. This idea was later discarded and the material scrapped. There are no remains of the line. An M-Bahn car is displayed at the Oldtimer Museum R√ºgen in Prora on an original piece of the line. = Fall of the wall and reunification of the networks = After the opening of the border on 9 November 1989, numerous temporary measures were taken to cope with the huge cross-border traffic. While S-Bahn services were quickly restored at Friedrichstra√üe station, it was not possible to reconnect line A quickly after it had been disrupted for 28 years. However, the so-called \\"ghost stations\\" (closed stations, which were passed without stopping) on the U6 and U8 reopened, so interchange was enabled from East Berlin's line A to West Berlin's U6 and U8 at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz stations respectively. On 1 July 1990, East Berlin's lines A and E were integrated into the western numbering scheme of the BVG. Line A was given the line number \\"U2\\". That led to a three-year-long curiosity, since the two U2s were not yet connected. Three months later, on 3 October 1990, the day of the reunification, the Berlin U-Bahn network was largely free pf \\"Communist \\" station names, which were mostly replaced by politically-neutral names. This involved renaming two stations on the U2 line: \\"Dimitroffstra√üe\\" to \\"Eberswalder Stra√üe\\", and \\"Otto-Grotewohl-Stra√üe\\" to \\"Mohrenstra√üe\\". The new station name of Eberswalder Strasse resulted from a power struggle between the Senate and Prenzlauer Berg district: since the latter refused to rename the former Danziger Strasse, which was named after the Bulgarian Communist Party leader Georgi Dimitroff. The BVG, on the order of the senator responsible for transport matters, renamed the elevated station after the street opposite, even though Eberswalder Stra√üe was much less significant. It has retained its name after Dimitroffstrasse was returned to its original name in 1995. Against the resistance from the conservative side, however, one name was retained: since Rosa Luxemburg also has numerous streets and squares named after her in western Germany, it was not possible to rename Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz back to Sch√∂nhauser Tor. In 1991, work began on rebuilding the missing link between the two parts of the U2, the section from Wittenbergplatz via Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz to Mohrenstrasse. This required some obstacles to be overcome and problems to be solved. The interim uses applied in the Sch√∂neberg elevated stations described above had to be ended and the M-Bahn line had to be dismantled. In the area of Potsdamer Platz station directly below the former border, the numerous security and border installations had to be removed. Finally, after numerous renovations, conversions and demolitions, the two lines were reconnected on 13 November 1993. At the time of the reopening, services on the Berlin small profile network were rearranged: * U1, previously Ruhleben ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor, now Krumme Lanke ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor * U2, previously Krumme Lanke ‚Äì Wittenbergplatz (West) and Mohrenstra√üe ‚Äì Vinetastra√üe (Ost), now Vinetastra√üe ‚Äì Ruhleben. * U3, previously Uhlandstra√üe ‚Äì Wittenbergplatz, now as U15, Uhlandstra√üe ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor. * a new night service, U12, Ruhleben ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor, on the route of the former U1. However, the U12 was discontinued in 2003 when night services were introduced on the weekend on almost all Berlin U-Bahn lines. =Two new stations in late 1990s= When the U2 reopened in 1993, preliminary work had been carried out on a new station on it. At the time, the ramp between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz stations had to be built completely rebuilt to enable the 120-metre-long station to be completely horizontal. Therefore, the ramp was redesigned and built a little steeper. The need for this station arose from the completion of new developments around Potsdamer Platz. A station with the provisional name of Hafenplatz was built by the BVG with two side platforms and opened as Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station on 1 October 1998. The construction works were done without impeding the operation of U2. The station, designed by the architects Hilmer & Sattler und Albrecht is 619 m from Potsdamer Platz and 469 m from Gleisdreieck stations. For decades, there had been plans for an extension of the U2 to Pankow S-Bahn station. In 1930, the line had been extended to Vinetastra√üe. A further extension towards the north was not built due to the Great Depression. Even during the Nazi era, the development plans always provided for the U2 to go at least to Pankow station or even to Pankower Kirche. It was the same in the GDR in the late 1980s, there were even announcements made about its construction. This was mainly because BVG lacked a workshop for small-profile rolling stock. All trains were serviced either in the Friedrichsfelde large-profile workshop or in the Reichsbahn's Schoeneweide workshop, which acquired the function of a main workshop. These premises were no longer considered acceptable and so space was sought for a new workshop, since the existing (very small) workshop at Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz station did not meet the requirements. This was to be built east of the Pankow freight yard on Granitzstra√üe. As part of these plans, the U-Bahn line would be extended by one station. Part of the planned tunnel extension was completed in 1988; after the fall of the wall, the tunnel has converted into a reversing facility. It was not until the mid 1990s that an extension began to be considered again. New interchanges were provided between the S-Bahn and U-Bahn at numerous points on the U-Bahn network, this included the extension of the U2 to Pankow. The groundbreaking ceremony for this new expansion of the network took place on 13 June 1997. The construction of a new small-profile workshop, as announced in GDR times, was also considered. While it was decided not to proceed with this project, since the current Grunewald workshop could carry out all work required without capacity problem, the foundations of a connection to a workshop were provided. Extremely difficult ground conditions, the high water table and the discovery of a medieval settlement slowed progress significantly. On 16 September 2000, the new line was opened with a new station providing interchange to the S-Bahn. The estimated cost of the works was DM 126 million, but it ended up costing only DM 105 million. During the planning, the new station was referred to as \\"Bahnhof Pankow\\", but the BVG opened it under the name \\"Pankow\\". The 110 metre-long U-Bahn station with its blue, white and yellow colour scheme had skylights, which were rare in the Berlin U-Bahn network, to enable natural light to penetrate into the station. It was designed by the architect Orlando Figallo. During the construction, a generous entrance building was built at the same time with a lift and escalators to provided convenient connections to S-Bahn line S2 to Bernau. There are also still plans according to which the U2 line would be extended to the old parish church in Breiten Stra√üe in Pankow. This plan is also included in the Berlin Senate's 2030 financial scenario. This is consider a medium-term priority. The two stations were the first built on Berlin's small-profile network in decades. = Further renovation and modernisation = Spittelmarkt station was restored to its original state. Alexanderplatz U-Bahn station to provide barrier-free access at all station levels. An extensive renovation program is currently being carried out on line U2 and this will continue for the next few years. The Senefelderplatz‚ÄìVinetastra√üe section was closed for several months for the opening of the section to Pankow station. Nevertheless, the stations and the track of the former line A suffered considerably during the GDR era, so the remaining stations in former East Berlin also had to be renovated. M√§rkisches Museum station was refurbished in 2003 and now also has a lift. The large interchange station of Alexanderplatz also received an all-round renovation and five lifts were installed. BVG had Olympia-Stadion station completely renovated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for ‚Ç¨4.47 million. In addition to new platform slabs and the refurbishment of the entrance building, it received two lifts that can be reached by an independent bridge from the station forecourt. Another renovation project is also under way on the Alexanderplatz‚ÄìStadtmitte section. Here the BVG plans to restore Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt stations to their original condition. The renewal of Spittelmarkt station has already been completed. The window gallery has been reopened there and the walls at the rear of the track have been decorated with newly fired ceramic tiles displaying various historical cityscapes. In addition, the BVG found in 2005 that a bridge between the Gleisdreieck and B√ºlowstra√üe stations, which dates back to the early days of the Berlin U-Bahn and was not renovated after German reunification has been significantly damaged. The renovation of the structure, which lies directly above the tunnel mouth of the North‚ÄìSouth mainline tunnel, started on 18 August 2006 and was originally intended to last until the end of the year. Due to problems with the manufacturing of the new steel bridge, the BVG extended the construction work until March 2007. During this period, the U2 was interrupted: the eastern Pankow‚ÄìGleisdreieck section was operated almost independently‚Äîapart from the connection at Alexanderplatz U-Bahn station. Only push-pull trains ran every ten minutes between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz due to the difficult situation. The western Ruhleben‚ÄìWittenbergplatz section was extended to Warschauer Strasse and formed the new line U12. At this time the Nollendorfplatz‚ÄìB√ºlowstra√üe‚ÄìGleisdreieck section was closed. Line U1, on the other hand, was shortened to the Wittenbergplatz‚ÄìUhlandstra√üe section, as in earlier times, while services on line U3 was extended by two stations to Gleisdreieck during the peak. In a ‚Ç¨7‚Äì8 million reconstruction, the bridge was straightened at the same time, which enabled the top speed to be increased from 40 to 50 km/h. Other projects, such as the modernisation of the U1 elevated line or Jannowitzbr√ºcke station were delayed due to the ‚Ç¨8 million renovation that had not been included in the BVG budget. Regular traffic on the U2 line was resumed on 19 March 2007 after the construction work had been completed. After the fire at Deutsche Oper station, the BVG decided to retrofit all stations that had only one exit with a second exit for safety reasons. Since the spring of 2006, the stations of Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Sophie-Charlotte-Platz and Deutsche Oper have had a second exit installed at the other end of the platform. In addition to the renovation program, the installation of lifts continues. In recent years Sch√∂nhauser Allee, M√§rkisches Museum, Alexanderplatz, Stadtmitte, Gleisdreieck, Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Olympia-Stadion and, in early 2009, Potsdamer Platz station, which is very important for tourists, have been given a lift. The 1.7 km-long viaduct of the elevated railway between the stations of Pankow and Senefelderplatz was extensively renovated in 2009 and 2010 at a cost of almost ‚Ç¨100 million. Eberswalder Stra√üe station received a lift as part of this work. This means that 20 of the 29 stations had barrier-free access in 2015.  Timetable Since the timetable change on 12 December 12 2004, only every second train has operated to Ruhleben during peak and off- peak hours; the others stopped short at Theodor-Heuss-Platz. Since 1990, there has been continuous night services on Friday and Saturday nights on the Ruhleben‚ÄìWittenbergplatz route (then line U1). In 2003, this was extended to the entire U2 line. There was already a ten-minute night service on the Vinetastra√üe‚ÄìMohrenstra√üe (then Otto-Grotewohl-Stra√üe) route in East Berlin. { style=\\"background-color:#EFEFEF;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" - ! width=\\"140\\" Line ! width=\\"120\\" Mon‚ÄìThu (peak) (7:00‚Äì9:30 and 14:30‚Äì19:00) ! width=\\"120\\" Mon‚ÄìThu (shoulder) (6:00‚Äì7:00, 9:30‚Äì14:30 and 19:00‚Äì21:00) ! width=\\"120\\" Fri (peak) (7:00‚Äì9:30 and 14:30‚Äì18:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Fri (shoulder) (6:00‚Äì7:00, 9:30‚Äì14:30 and 18:30‚Äì22:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Sat (10.00‚Äì22:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Sun and public holidays (12:30‚Äì19:00) ! width=\\"120\\" Off-peak (Mon‚ÄìFri 4:30‚Äì6:00; Mon‚ÄìThu from 21:00; Fri+Sat from 22:30 and Sun 19:00‚Äì0:30/Sat 5:30‚Äì10:00 and Sun 7:00‚Äì12:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Night Fri/Sat and Sat/Sun and on nights before public holidays (Fri/Sat 0:30‚Äì5:30 and Sat/Sun 0:30‚Äì7:00) - style=\\"background-color:#FFFFFF\\" Pankow ‚Üî Theodor-Heuss-Platz 4 min school holidays: min 5 min 4 min school holidays: min 5 min 5 min 5 min 10 min 15 min - style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\" Theodor-Heuss-Platz ‚Üî Ruhleben 8 min school holidays 9 min 10 min 8 min school holidays 9 min 10 min 10 min 10 min 10 min 15 min - style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" During the nights of Fri/Sat and Sat/Sun, the U2 trains run every 15 minutes between Pankow and Ruhleben from 0:30 a.m. to around 4:30 a.m. During the nights from Sun/Mon to Thu/Fri, night bus line N2 substitutes for the U-Bahn services. } = Increase in frequencies= Under the Berlin Senate's local transport plan for 2019‚Äì2023 the frequency is to be reduced to 3.3 minutes by 2023 during the peak hour.

This extension is the only development of the small- profile network included in the Berlin Senate's financial scenario for 2030. In the west, an extension is planned from Ruhleben to Stadtrandstra√üe, via Ruhlebener Stra√üe, Tiefwerder Weg, Rathaus Spandau, Flankenschanze, Zeppelinstra√üe, Westerwaldstra√üe, Falkenhagener Feld and Stadtrandstra√üe. It has been deferred to after 2030 because the expected patronage is not high enough to justify the extension.

It serves five stations, with only the two termini being step-free. History In 1903, the then-independent town of Sch√∂neberg, south-west of Berlin, planned to develop an underground railway line to improve public transportation. As the line promised less profit, the negotiations with the former () were unsuccessful. Consequently, Sch√∂neberg started to build the line itself on 8 December 1908. Two years later, the construction was finished and, on 1 December 1910, the line was put into operation, as Line BI. Because this line was separate from the pre-existing underground railway, new equipment was required; Sch√∂neberg chose to use tracks and trains compatible with the rest of the fledgeling network, allowing future connections. Although Sch√∂neberg owned the track, upon opening, it handed operations over to the Hochbahngesellschaft. The service depot, located after Innsbrucker Platz station, was expanded in 1926 upon the opening of the U-Bahn platforms of Nollendorfplatz station and was closed in 1932. After World War II a high school was built at the site of the former U4 depot. Nowadays, trains use a spur track that connects line U4 to line U1 where they can access the Warschauer Stra√üe Depot on the latter line. From 1985 until 1993 automatic train operation using the SelTrac system was trialled on line U4. The SelTrac system used on line U4 was manufactured by Standard Elektrik Lorenz (now part of Alcatel-Lucent), and allowed very tight headways of 50 to 90 seconds.  History  The city of Sch√∂neberg wanted to increase growth, and so decided in 1903 to build an U-Bahn line. There were talks with the Berlin Hochbahngesellschaft (U-Bahn operator). However, the interests of the operator and the city did not match, because the short distance wouldn't bring any profit. So the city of Sch√∂neberg took matters into its own hands and planned the first municipal U-Bahn in Germany. The route was intended as an underground railway from Nollendorfplatz, at which the elevated train station of the Berlin Hoch- und Untergrundbahn was already located, to the hauptstrasse in the south of Sch√∂neberg. An extension to the north was not excluded, even a route to Weissensee (following the proposed U3/U10 alignment) was proposed. First, however, the stations Nollendorfplatz (own tunnel station on Motzstra√üe in front of the existing station), Victoria-Luise-Platz, Bayerischer Platz, Stadtpark (today: Rathaus Sch√∂neberg) and Hauptstrasse (today: Innsbrucker Platz) planned. South of the station hauptstrasse, the workshop was to be built. Siemens & Halske AEG were given the responsibility of the entire construction, including the equipment of the track and the delivery of the vehicles. All standards were adapted to the already existing Berlin U-Bahn and subway, as in the future a direct connection to the City U-bahn Hochbahngesellschaft was planned. Therefore, the execution of the route was carried out with the dimensions and electrical equipment of the Berlin Kleinprofil (small-profile) network. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 8, 1908 in a folk festival-like atmosphere. Next to the construction of the subway was Rudolph Wilde Park, which at that time was called the station Stadtpark. As the park was built on a marshy fens that was up to 30 meters deep, the excavation of the tunnels with a total volume of around 850,000 m¬≥ was used to drain and fill it. After two years of construction, the line was opened on 1 December 1910. However, the festivities were very restrained, as the largest Sch√∂neberg sponsor of the underground, Mayor Rudolph Wilde, had died a month earlier. Since the Sch√∂neberg subway (initially) was completely separate from the (other) Berlin network, extra facilities had to be built for this. These included its own wagons and the depot with a workshop. At Nollendorfplatz, a pedestrian tunnel was built between the two stations. South of the station Innsbrucker Platz, the tunnel was continued into Eisackstra√üe. There was a three - track crossover and parking facility in the tunnel. From the western track, the workshop access line branched off to the workshop, which swung in to a private tunnel to Otzenstra√üe and reached the daylight on the workshop area. At the end of the tunnel in Otzenstra√üe, today there is still visible the tunnel exit. At the end of the workshop area there was another short tunnel where the access track ended. The workshop received a five-track wagon hall and a two-track workshop hall. The small Sch√∂neberg workshop was rendered unused with the opening of the new interchange station at Nollendorfplatz in 1926 and therefore decommissioned in 1932, as a permissive vehicle exchange and the achievement of the large workshops of the U-Bahn at the olympic-stadion station and at Warschauer Brucke were possible. On the workshop grounds, the Waldenburg High School was built after the Second World War. The city of Sch√∂neberg was indeed owner and owner of the route, but the operation was run by the Berlin Hochbahngesellschaft. Thus, the different ownership conditions did not matter at all for the passengers, since one day before the opening a collective agreement had been reached. On November 27, 2010, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Sch√∂neberg subway, special traffic with historical rolling stock (type A1) took place. References Berlin U-Bahn lines ","title":"U4 (Berlin U-Bahn)"},{"id":"594645","text":"U5 train at Elsterwerdaer Platz U5 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn. It runs from Alexanderplatz in Mitte eastwards through Friedrichshain, Lichtenberg and Friedrichsfelde, surfaces in to pass Kaulsdorf and Hellersdorf above ground and finally reaches city limits at H√∂now. U5 at present only connects to other U-Bahn lines at its Alexanderplatz terminus, although work is ongoing to extend it across central Berlin to Berlin Hauptbahnhof, providing further U-Bahn and S-Bahn interchanges. History =Early history= Before control of the U-Bahn network was handed over completely to the BVG in 1929, the Hochbahngesellschaft started construction on a final line that, in contrast to its previous lines, was built as part of the Gro√üprofil network. It was supposed to be a branch for the U2, which starts from Klosterstra√üe in 1908. The E line ran under Frankfurter Allee, for which the company had received the concession in 1914, between Alexanderplatz and Friedrichsfelde before the World War II. The construction work proceeded since 1927 without delay or undue expense, and the first servicing station was established in the eastern part of the city; the line opened on 21 December 1930, named Line E. The several stations do include: *Alexanderplatz (interchange) *Schillingstra√üe *Strausberger Platz *Memeler Stra√üe (today's Weberwiese) *Petersburger Stra√üe (today's Frankfurter Tor) *Samariterstra√üe *Frankfurter Allee (interchange with S-Bahn) *Magdalenenstra√üe *Lichtenberg (interchange with Ringbahn) *Friedrichsfelde (end terminus and depot) =Tierpark extension= Heavy bomb damage caused by Allied air raids and invaded water at the end of the war severely curtailed operations in the first post-war months. Thereafter, the trains of this line had to be sent as reparations to Moscow and replaced accordingly. Only in the 1960s were comprehensively new trains procured, until 1968 still small profile trains were still in use. Line E was the only purely East Berlin line. For a long time, it was planned to extend it beyond its former terminus Friedrichsfelde and to lead via Karlshorst to Obersch√∂neweide. Karlshorst was especially known for its villa colony. There, after the war, the Soviet military administration established itself. But both reasons were not sufficient to extend the line E to Karlshorst. Due to the large demand for housing in Berlin, a large part of the construction capacity was needed for housing construction. The areas intended for housing included the areas west of the Tierpark zoo. For about 25,000 residents, 9,000 apartments were to be built here. To connect this residential area better to the city center, it was decided to extend the subway line E by one stop. In addition, about 2.5 million zoo visitors per year were expected. For these expected passenger flows, it was worthwhile to extend the subway. During the time when Berlin was divided, the U5 was the only line to fall entirely within East Berlin, and the only line to be actively extended by the East German authorities. Work on this extension was started in September 1969. On 6 June 1973, the first extension was opened, to Tierpark station, serving the zoo. =Final extension= Wuhletal, the connection between the S-Bahn and the U-Bahn In the 1970s, there were also plans to extend the line over to Hellersdorf. For this purpose, the then district Marzahn was divided into Marzahn and Hellersdorf. Due to the large extent of the developing area, a rapid transit connection to the centre of East Berlin, Alexanderplatz was needed. For this purpose, several proposals were developed. The idea to build the S-Bahn, as done previously for the new residential areas in Marzahn and Hohensch√∂nhausen, was rejected because the trams were already heavily utilised and could not accommodate another train group. An express tram, which was realised in Potsdam, would not have sufficient capacity. Only the extension of the subway (U5) fulfilled all the requirements. Again, there were several route variants. It was decided to run the underground above ground on the unused railway line of the VnK route (connection to Kaulsdorf). In addition, an interchange at Wuhletal for connection to the S5 S-Bahn line, was needed. The extension was planned in the years 1983 and 1984. It would be 10.1 kilometers long and have nine stations. The new building, which was almost completely above ground, was opened in two sections. Construction began on 1 March 1985. The final extension went into service on 1 July 1988 (Elsterwerdaer Platz) and 1 July 1989 (H√∂now). The last two stations of the extension, Louis-Lewin-Stra√üe and H√∂now, were originally located outside Berlin city limit, in Bezirk Frankfurt. The area was joined to Berlin at German reunification in 1990. All stations were designed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (EVDR) design and surveying operations. For the first time, the stations were equipped with ramps to enable step-free access to platforms for passengers with prams and wheelchairs. At Hellersdorf a connection to the local tram was created: the stops islands can be reached via a tunnel, the crossing of the street is thus eliminated. =Signalling= After reunification, the U5 was upgraded to the new signalling system under Systemtechnik f√ºr den automatischen Regelbetrieb (STAR). The test stretch is from Friedrichsfelde to Biesdorf-S√ºd, using H-Zug trains, which were introduced from 1996 to April 2000. The Class H, used on the U5 can be converted to fully automatic train operation, and there is still a Bombardier test train, built in 1995, who can drive the train automatically. In contrast to the testing with LZB 501 on the U9 line as well as SelTrac on U2 and U4 lines, which used transmission of information between route control and the train using line conductor loops (Linienzugbeeinflussung), STAR made use of radio technology (Funkzugbeeinflussung). When the Berlin Senate reiterated in 2002 that the U5 should initially not be extended further, the BVG announced that it would no longer pursue the automatic operation project. An operation on the U5 Alexanderplatz - H√∂now would have made little sense according to the BVG. At that time, the BVG was the technology leader. The underground lines U2 and U3 of the Nuremberg U-Bahn are the first automated subway lines in Germany since 2008 and 2010, respectively. In the previous 1980s driverless operation on the U4 a driver continued to be present but supervised the ride only. =Refurbishment= At reunification, the line was renumbered as U5 to match the naming system in use in West Berlin. Between January 2003 and December 2004, reconstruction was conducted between Alexanderplatz and Friedrichsfelde in order to repair damage dating back to World War II. Not all the stations were preserved as monumental value. 1330 meters of railway track and tracks were relocated. For this purpose, the train traffic on the route was interrupted for three months. The aim was to improve the quality of stay at the stations. The lighting has been renewed and brighter, the technology has been brought up to date, the plaster has been extensively renovated and the walls have been clad in vandalism with enamelled sheet steel. The BVG took over Grenander's principle of identifying colors, but chose new color patterns. Numerous metro stations have been equipped with lifts and barrier- free. An example of a completely new design, including the rebuilding of the northern end of the station, is the Schillingstra√üe station. In time for the International Garden Exhibition 2017, and neighboring \\"gardens of the world\\", the station Neu Grottkauer Stra√üe was redeveloped in the spring of 2017 to provide a lift, new roof and new lighting, and renamed Kienberg (Gardens of the World). The renaming occurred at the timetable change in December 2016. The cost of all measures has been estimated at around ‚Ç¨ 6.6 million. The latest stations, built between 1973 and 1989 from Tierpark to H√∂now should be placed under monument protection, with the exception of this is the already significantly changed subway station Kienberg (Garten der Welt). A refurbishment of the other aboveground stations built in GDR times is not planned before the middle of the 2020s. Equipped with elevators for fully accessible access is not planned until the lift program is completed on the rest of the metro network. The existing ramp systems with a slope of around 10% are only considered as barrier-free. =Former U5= There used to be former U5 running from Deutsche Oper to Richard-Wagner-Platz, from 1 March 1966 to 1 May 1970. Before 1966, it was numbered AI and BI and the branch line as AIII. In 1970, the stretch was closed and in 1974, the station was demolished.  Plans  There have long been plans to extend the U5 westward. The short U55 line opened in August 2009, and runs from Berlin Hauptbahnhof via the Bundestag U-Bahn station to Brandenburger Tor station. The designation of the line as U55 indicates that it is ultimately intended to become part of the U5 line. Construction of the link to enable this commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The link will be in length, and connect the Brandenburger Tor terminus of the current U55 to the Alexanderplatz terminus of the current U5. Along its route it will serve new U-bahn stations at Berliner Rathaus, Museumsinsel and Unter den Linden, with the latter providing an interchange with line U6. = Further planning = In the long term, there are plans to extend the line from Berlin Hauptbahnhof, via Turmstra√üe and Jungfernheide to Flughafen Tegel. This plan was postponed due to the route being too long, the pending closure of Tegel Airport and the poor fiscal position of Berlin. An addition to the plan is extension towards Rathaus Reinickendorf via Cit√© Pasteur Nord, Scharnweberstra√üe and Eichborndamm. The stations that were involved in the extension include: *Alt- Moabit *Turmstra√üe *Huttenstra√üe *Goslarer Platz *Jungfernheide *Hakenfelde *Urban Tech Republic *Cit√© Pasteur Nord *Scharnweberstra√üe *Eichborndamm *Rathaus Reinckendorf In September 2016, the longer extension has been replaced by the tram extension from Hauptbahnhof, via Turmstra√üe, Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and towards the Tegel Airport, and it might be redeveloped into a new Urban Tech Republic development area, after Tegel Airport is closed, thus allowing the U5 to be shortened to just Berlin Hauptbahnhof. The possibility of extending the tram line to Cit√© Pasteur Nord, Scharnweberstra√üe and Eichborndamm to Rathaus Reinickendorf is still there in the vision stage. The tram extension was planned to be completed just before 2028. At Jungfernheide, two island platforms were constructed for the planned interchange station between U7 and U5. The finished section is used for firefighting exercises in conjunction with airport security and the BVG. Trains that are used include 2712/2713 ('9 Zoolog. Garten') and 2714/2715 (Jakob-Kaiser-Platz), of which they were vandalised with legal spray painting. During the opening of 1980, Jungfernheide was in a deadlock because of the Berlin Wall, that prevented U5 from extending towards the west.  Frequency U5's frequency is about 5 minutes during peak periods. Alternate trains will terminate at Kaulsdorf-Nord during off-peak periods, thus the lower demand section is 10 minutes. Since 2003, U5 has offered 15-minute weekend night service, the replacement bus service \\"N5\\" was offered during weekday nights.

Entrance to the Borsigwerke station U6 is a Berlin U-Bahn line, long line with 29 stations. It runs in a north-south direction from the Berlin locality of Tegel in the north via Friedrichstra√üe to Mariendorf, a locality in the southern part of the city. It is a so-called large profile (\\"Gro√üprofil\\") line.For historical reasons, the Berlin U-Bahn has cars of two different widths (designated small profile and large profile) despite their common track gauge (similar to the A and B Divisions of the New York City Subway). This necessitates independent operation of the lines on which they travel and a separate servicing infrastructure because of the different tunnel diameters and power supply systems. The narrower cars were built until 1930. During the Cold War, both U6 termini were in the former West Berlin but the line passed under East Berlin for a short section of its route. Five of its stations were sealed off by East German authorities and the trains went through these so-called ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù without stopping, while a sixth, Friedrichstra√üe, remained open primarily as a transfer station between the U6 and the S-Bahn lines using the north-south S-Bahn tunnel, but also as an official border crossing between East and West Berlin. It was formerly named \\"CI\\" from 1923 to 1928. Current routing U6 begins its journey from its northern terminus in central Tegel, first running in a southeasterly direction underground along the path of Berliner Stra√üe to the Borsigwerke station, after which it surfaces to run on an embankment beside Seidelstra√üe and Scharnweberstra√üe. Just after the Scharnweberstra√üe station it enters a tunnel and continues under M√ºllerstra√üe (which becomes Chausseestra√üe and then Friedrichstra√üe). From this point it runs in a distinctly southerly direction. After Mehringplatz at the Hallesches Tor station, U6 crosses under the Landwehr Canal and swings slightly westwards to run parallel to Mehringdamm, which changes its name to Tempelhofer Damm at the Platz der Luftbr√ºcke station, and then to Mariendorfer Damm after crossing the Teltow Canal. U6 crosses this canal in a conduit attached to and immediately below the road- traffic bridge. The line ends at the intersection of Reisseckstra√üe, Friedenstra√üe and Mariendorfer Damm at its terminus, the Alt-Mariendorf station.  History  = Beginnings = As early as 1901 the city of Berlin had plans for a subway running from north to south under Friedrichstra√üe. Werner von Siemens also had plans for a line under that impressive street, but at the time the city decided the transport system should be in public hands and began construction of the so-called North-South Line from Wedding to Tempelhof, with a branch to Neuk√∂lln. This work was delayed and finally abandoned due to difficulties associated with World War I. Relics of this early phase up to 1918 can still be found in the rolled-steel support pillars at the Oranienburger Tor station, still bearing the trade name of the supplying rolling mill, Rombach in Alsace-Lorraine. The North-South line (now U6/U7) showing its name and extent in 1930 In 1919 work was resumed, but during the post-war hyperinflation period the filling in of the already existing tunnel was proposed in 1921. However it was decided to continued construction after all, and on 30 January 1923 the first tunnel section was opened between Hallesches Tor and Stettiner Bahnhof (the latter going by the name of Naturkundemuseum station since 13 December 2009, replacing the name Zinnowitzer Stra√üe station). A northwest extension was opened on 8 March 1923 between Stettiner Bahnhof and Seestra√üe, with a maintenance workshop being built at the Seestra√üe station. At the junction Mohrenstra√üe and Friedrichstra√üe two subway lines intersected for the first time: the city‚Äôs North-South Line, renamed Line C, and the private Central Line (Centrumsline). But as the concept of a tower station (accommodating two lines stacked one above the other) was not well known, the city of Berlin built its own station, named Leipziger Stra√üe (now Stadtmitte),160 meters from the Central Line station. The result is that passengers transferring between the two lines still today have to walk through a long connecting pedestrian tunnel, popularly known by Berliners as the ‚Äúmouse route‚Äù (\\"M√§usetunnel\\"). At Belle- Alliance Stra√üe (now named Mehringdamm) where the line separated into two branches, three tracks were built. From the western track (side platform), trains ran to both termini, Tempelhof and Neuk√∂lln; the central platform was used for trains heading downtown, the middle track for those coming from Neuk√∂lln and the eastern track for trains coming from Tempelhof. In the course of constructing the U7 line, the station was completely redesigned and is now called Mehringdamm. Due to disputes with the administrative district of Tempelhof, the first route to be built was the branch to Neuk√∂lln. Work on the other branch only began in 1924, but just two years later, on 14 February 1926, the stretch from Belle-Alliance-Stra√üe to Kreuzberg (now the Platz der Luftbr√ºcke station) was opened. A year later this second branch extended to Tempelhof Airport (now the Paradestra√üe station). This now-closed airport was located to the east of the U6 track. In 1929 the line was extended to intersect with the S-Bahn‚Äôs Tempelhof station on the circle line (Ringbahn). A large ticket hall was erected for both S- and U-Bahn passengers. Since the station had to be built very deep to accommodate the subway line, there was room for a spacious ticket hall. =The northern extension= Even as construction of the North-South/C Line began there were plans to extend it to Berlin-Tegel, and 400 meters of tunnel had been prepared by 1929. This extension from the existing Seestra√üe station to the center of Tegel made several bus and tram lines redundant and for that reason this stretch was the first to be worked on after the war in the western part of the city. The first pile was driven on 26 October 1953 at M√ºllerstra√üe north of the Seestra√üe station. The stretch was built in two sections: *Seestra√üe to Kurt-Schumacher- Platz *Kurt-Schumacher-Platz to Tegel For reasons of cost and because of a very high water table there, north of Kurt-Schumacher-Platz it was decided to put the track on an embankment instead of in a cutting. A ramp raise the track 15 meters to an embankment and onward to Berlin‚Äôs first station for large profile cars, the Scharnweberstra√üe station. After passing the Holzhauser Stra√üe station on this northwestern stretch, the tracks return underground, following the course of Berliner Stra√üe to the center of Berlin-Tegel. The embankment station at Scharnweberstra√üe The underground northern terminus of U6, Alt-Tegel (formerly Tegel) As was the case before World War II, the stations had a very functional design with its surfaces covered with bright, pastel-colored ceramic tiles. The embankment stations were built of reinforced concrete, which was typical for the time. Nowadays this gives them a very bulky appearance so they do not radiate the charm of many of the suburban stations, such as those on the U3 line to the south. A first section was opened on 3 May 1956, the second on 31 May 1958. With the opening of the C Line the northern Berlin Transport Company (BVG) network was completely restructured and numerous tram lines in this area could be eliminated. = \\"Ghost stations\\" = The Schwartzkopffstra√üe station in 2004. It was one of the ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù closed from 1961 to 1990 After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, on the orders of German Democratic Republic interior minister Karl Maron all U6 stations inside East Berlin were closed to passenger traffic, except for the Friedrichstra√üe station. At that station, West-Berlin passengers could transfer to the S-Bahn or enter East Berlin via the established border crossing there. This order turned all remaining closed stations into so-called \\"ghost stations\\", through which trains were required to pass without stopping and which could only be entered by East German border and traffic policemen. To service the area formerly accessible to the East Berlin population via the U6, until the ghost stations were reopened a bus line 59 was established between the Walter Ulbricht-Stadium, later renamed World Youth Stadium (Stadion der Weltjugend), and Leipziger Stra√üe. The ghost stations did not appear on East German city maps. They were successively renovated and opened between 11 November 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall (U8 Jannowitzbr√ºcke station) and 1 July 1990, the date of German reunification (the last U6 stations to open were Stadion der Weltjugend/Schwartzkopfstra√üe., Nordbahnhof/Naturkundenmuseum, Oranienburger Tor, Franz√∂sische Stra√üe and Stadtmitte).J√ºrgen Meyer-Kronthaler, Klaus Kurpjuweit. Berliner U-Bahn - In Fahrt seit uber hundert Jahren, be.bra verlag Berlin, pp. 142-143 A cold war curiosity: Schwartzkopffstra√üe station, renamed Walter-Ulbricht Stadion in April 1951 after the newly built sports field, was one of the five U6 ghost stations. Nevertheless, on 15 March, the 1973 East Berlin authorities did not hesitate to rename the underground station which had been deserted for eleven years Stadion der Weltjugend ‚Äì the signs with the station name visible only to (mostly West-Berlin) subway passengers as their train passed through the station. = Completion of line 6 = As with the northern extension to Tegel, ever since construction of Line C began it was planned to extend it to Alt- Mariendorf as the southern terminus. The Nazis had planned to extend the line even further south to the Mariendorf horse race track (Trabrennbahn Mariendorf). When work on the long-awaited extension began, there were debates about the cost and it was, for example, proposed to lay the track in a cutting next to the Tempelhofer Damm/Mariendorf Damm roads. The public transport company BVG objected, arguing that easy access to the Tempelhof municipal offices (Rathaus Tempelhof) and the main shopping street would only be possible with an underground line. Trimodal transport at the Teltow Canal near the Ullsteinstra√üe station: road vehicles, U-Bahn conduit and canal sightseeing barge The first pile for the 3.5-kilometer route was driven on 6 March 1961 and the Alt-Mariendorf terminus station was opened on 28 February 1966. The route is from the S-and U-Bahn station Tempelhof straight south along the Tempelhofer Damm to the Teltow canal. Similar to the construction of today‚Äôs U7 line to Rudow, the canal posed the biggest problem for the track in this area and an unusual solution was found. The U6 tracks are contained in a construction underneath and connected to the lower part of the road traffic bridge over the canal. The side with the northbound rail was built with enough space for the Ullsteinstra√üe station. Since the canal shipping required a vertical clearance of 4.6 meters, ramps were built to raise the road 1.2 meters above its original level. Ullsteinstra√üe station South of the Teltow Canal the U6 follows Mariendorfer Damm to the terminus station Alt-Mariendorf, which was built at the junction of the roads Rei√üeckstra√üe/Friedensstra√üe and Mariendorfer Damm. From here, several bus routes service the sparsely developed surroundings. This expansion completed the U6 line. Further extensions are not planned. Except for the Alt-Tempelhof station, all stations were designed by the architect Rainer G. R√ºmmler. As with the southern part of the U7 line, he used large rectangular ceramic tiles to surface the station walls. = Reopening = Station restoration and modification of the platforms and tunnels was started after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and all the former ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù had been opened by 1 July 1990. When the U6 was built between 1912 and 1923, money was scarce because of World War I and the subsequent hyperinflation period, and the tight budgetary situation of the city of Berlin as the owner of the new North-South line did not leave much of a financial margin. The stations for the small-profile trains, built earlier, had been more attractively designed, whereas the U6 merely had white plaster finishing. The only distinguishing feature for each station was a characteristic color for the columns and station signs. The length of the platforms was also reduced. Lengths of 110‚Äì120 meters were customary for the platforms built later, but at that time only 80-meter platforms were constructed. Already in the 1970s the first capacity problems arose because only four-car trains could be accommodated on these platforms. Therefore, in the 1960s and 1970s the West Berlin subway stations were modified to extend the platforms so longer trains could be used. But since modification of the U6‚Äôs three border stations, Friedrichstra√üe, Kochstra√üe and Reinckendorfer Stra√üe, was either not possible or would have involved paying a considerable sum of money to East Germany, and since the trains did not even stop at the 5 ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù, only four-car trains could be operated on the U6 line. As compensation, the trains arrived at 3-minute intervals during rush hours. The Friedrichstra√üe station needed longer platforms, and the difficult solution due to space restrictions causes inevitable congestion during rush hours In order to provide six-car trains to handle the traffic after German reunification in 1990, the Berlin Senate allocated 250 million DM to extend the platforms of the northern stations Schwartzkopffstra√üe and Reinickendorfer Stra√üe, and the southern stations Kochstra√üe, Stadtmitte, Franz√∂sische Stra√üe, Friedrichstra√üe, Oranienburger Tor, and Zinnowitzer Stra√üe (today Naturkundemuseum), The modifications took four years - from July 1992 to September 1996 ‚Äì without service interruption in various stations: *Oranienburger Tor - modified from July 27, 1992 to April 1994 *Friedrichstra√üe - modified from September 1992 to June 1995 *Reinickendorfer Stra√üe - modified from July 1993 to October 1995 *Kochstra√üe - modified from October 1993 to January 1996 *Stadtmitte and Franzoische Stra√üe - modified from 1994 to 29 September 1996 *Zinnowitzer Stra√üe and Schwartzkopffstra√üe - modified from 1995 to 29 September 1996  Plans for the future  The extension of the U5 line from Alexanderplatz to Brandenburger Tor to will include a station Unter den Linden at Friedrichstra√üe, offering an opportunity to transfer to the U6 line. This construction work required a discontinuation of service between the Friedrichstra√üe and Franz√∂sische Stra√üe stations between July 2012 and October 2013, and abandonment of the Franz√∂sische Stra√üe station when the U5 extension is opened in 2019. In the old 200 km plans it was known that U6 will be extended to Hennigsdorf, Lichterfelde-Sud and Teltow Stadt. The southern U6 extension goes from Alt- Mariendorf, Trabrennbahn Mariendorf, Tauernallee, Marienfelde S√ºd, Goethestra√üe, Barnetstra√üe and towards Alt-Lichtenrade.  Frequency  Trains were running at 4-min intervals during peak periods and 5-min intervals during off-peak periods. Night service was introduced in 2003 and it is running at 15-minute frequency. References Berlin U-Bahn lines ","title":"U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)"},{"id":"594648","text":"The U7 is a rail line on the Berlin U-Bahn. It runs completely underground for a length of through 40 stations and connects Spandau, via Neuk√∂lln, to Gropiusstadt and Rudow. The line was originally the south-eastern branch of the Nord-S√ºd-Bahn (U6) that ran between the branching point at Belle-Alliance- Stra√üe (Mehringdamm) and Grenzallee; however, in the 1960s, this stretch was separated from the rest of the line and extended at each end to form a new line. As of 2007, the U7 is Berlin's longest underground line, both in terms of absolute length and total travel time, and one of the longest subterranean lines in Europe. Route Starting in Rudow, at the junction of Gross- Ziethener Chaussee and Neuk√∂llner Stra√üe, the U7 runs northwest below the road Alt-Rudow, before bearing west in the Gropiusstadt area. Because the settlement and underground construction there were planned simultaneously, the U7 follows no roads until it reaches Britz-S√ºd station, where it runs under Fritz-Reuter-Allee as far as Blaschkoallee station before joining the route of Buschkrugallee. It continues north, crossing the urban motorway and the Ringbahn while under Karl-Marx-Stra√üe, then heads north-west under Hasenheide, S√ºdstern, and Gneisenaustra√üe until it reaches Mehringdamm after a very sharp right curve. A tight left curve brings the U7 under the () to M√∂ckernbr√ºcke station, with another taking it back and below the area of the former (). The route continues west under Yorckstra√üe, Willmanndamm, Grunewaldstra√üe, Bayerischer Platz, and Berliner Stra√üe, then heads north under Brandenburgische Stra√üe to Adenauerplatz station. A curve into Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe takes the U7 north to Bismarckstra√üe station, where it makes a further turn into Richard-Wagner-Stra√üe, travelling under this road and its northern continuations Wintersteinstra√üe and S√∂mmeringstra√üe. At Jungfernheide station, the U7 crosses the Ringbahn for the second time before passing under the Westhafenkanal. The track then turns west through a wide arc and follows Siemensdamm and Nonnendammallee. It passes to the south of the Spandau Citadel below the road Am Juliusturm, runs under the Old Town of Spandau, and ends at Rathaus Spandau station. The U7 passes through 12 districts of Berlin: Rudow, Gropiusstadt, Britz, Neuk√∂lln, Kreuzberg, Sch√∂neberg, Wilmersdorf, Charlottenburg, Charlottenburg-Nord, Siemensstadt, Haselhorst, and Spandau. History = Construction of the North-South Underground: 1901-1930 = Map of the former Nord-S√ºd Bahn in 1930 Around 1901, the city of Berlin planned to build an underground railway line below Friedrichstra√üe to connect the north to the south. Werner von Siemens also had plans for a north‚Äìsouth line, under Nobelstra√üe, at the same time, but permission for these was declined on the grounds that public transport should be in municipal ownership. Consequently, Berlin started the construction of the Nord‚ÄìS√ºd-Bahn (North‚ÄìSouth railway) to link Wedding and Tempelhof (as of 2007, part of the U6), with a branch to Neuk√∂lln. World War I made the construction work difficult, and finally stopped it completely. In 1919, work started again, but not without further complications. In 1921, during the time of hyperinflation, filling up the existing tunnels was considered as financial turmoil hit hard. The construction work was continued, however, and the first tunnel section from Hallesches Tor to Stettiner Bahnhof (later renamed Naturkundemuseum) was opened on 30 January 1923. The history of the U7 began with the construction of the branch to Neuk√∂lln, when the stretch from Hallesches Tor to Gneisenaustra√üe was built; it opened on 9 April 1924. With inflation still taking its toll, the construction work proceeded in small steps only. The extension to Hasenheide station, named after a nearby park (and later renamed S√ºdstern), followed on 14 December of the same year. As the financial situation of Germany and Berlin improved, so too did the underground railway construction, including the branch to Neuk√∂lln. At Hermannplatz station, which resembles something of an U-Bahn cathedral, the first underground rail‚Äìrail crossing in Berlin was developed; transfer to the GN-Bahn (later the U8) was intended at this station. The station is also the first Berlin underground station to use escalators. The section from Hasenheide to Bergstra√üe (later Karl-Marx-Stra√üe) was put into operation on 11 April 1926. The final stage of the Neuk√∂lln branch at that time, the 1.5 kilometre-long (0.9 mi) extension to Grenzallee, was put into operation on 21 December 1930‚Äîthe same day of the opening of what would become the U5 line‚Äîduring one of the largest underground opening celebrations. Underground passengers could then travel from Seestra√üe (U6), through the city centre, to either Tempelhof or Grenzallee. The post-war underground lines were marked out from their 1901‚Äì1914 predecessors by their larger tunnels and trains, in order to provide greater competition with the privately run (). The new trains and tunnels, which were wider but used the same standard-gauge track, were described as (). =Connection to Rudow= Rudow terminus station platform. Following World War II‚Äîin which many of Berlin's residences were destroyed‚Äîlarge new housing developments were needed. Britz and Britz-Buckow-Rudow (BBR; later renamed Gropiusstadt), which were established in the south of West Berlin, required a new rapid-transit railway connection to the West Berlin city centre; the construction work for the underground railway began on 2 November 1959. The track from Grenzallee to Britz-S√ºd opened on 28 September 1963. Construction began from Britz-S√ºd to Rudow on 2 January 1965. Travel to Zwickauer Damm was made possible on 2 January 1970, and Rudow received connection to Line 7 on 1 July 1972. =Extension to the west= The branch station Belle-Alliance-Stra√üe (later renamed Mehringdamm), which opened in 1924, had three tracks: a connection to Tempelhof led from the first platform; to Neuk√∂lln from the second; and to the city centre from the third. A separation of the Neuk√∂llner branch from the North-South Line was decided upon in order to avoid an overload on the transfer station Hallesches Tor. Therefore, Line 7 was extended west from Belle-Alliance-Stra√üe. The construction work began in the middle of 1962, and was completed on 26 February 1966 with the link to M√∂ckernbr√ºcke station. Beside the construction of M√∂ckernbr√ºcke station, changes to Mehringdamm station‚Äîwhich would become a transfer point between unbranched lines‚Äîwere necessary. The further extension of Line 7 was accomplished with subsidy funds. The construction of the track from M√∂ckernbr√ºcke to Fehrbelliner Platz started on 1 July 1962, and finished on 29 January 1971. Altstadt Spandau: Last station before the terminus Rathaus Spandau =In three stages to Spandau: 1960-1984= At the end of the 1960s, ideas about an underground railway line to Spandau arose again. The planned extension to Line 7 through Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and Nonnendammallee was chosen to improve public transportation to Siemensstadt‚Äîimportant for its many jobs. Already at the time, there were plans to build a subway to Spandau. First steps were taken with the extension of the line of today's line U2 to Ruhleben. The terminus Ruhleben is located directly on the district border to Spandau. Feeder and distribution traffic, until 1967 by tram, replaced by several bus lines, provided solely for the development of Spandau on the subway station Ruhleben. The construction work for the section Fehrbelliner Platz‚ÄìRichard- Wagner-Platz began in 1969 which is H-West-II. By 1970, the then shortest and less frequented subway line of Berlin, line 5, oscillated between Deutsche Oper and Richard Wagner Platz. Their old route was shut down for passenger traffic, and a new station was built several meters below the old one. The remaining tunnels could be converted into an operating section, making it the second exchange line between small and large profile after the Waisentunnel at Alexanderplatz station. The route continues under the Brandenburgische Stra√üe and crosses the Kurf√ºrstendamm at Adenauerplatz, where a train station was also built. The station was created as a crossing station as it was (and officially still is) planned to extend the current U-Bahn line U1 from Uhlandstra√üe to Adenauerplatz. After Adenauerplatz, the track swings under Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe and passes under the Stadtbahn. Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe was constructed with a pedestrian passage to the Charlottenburg S-Bahn station. At Bismarckstra√üe, a new underground railway station had to be built, since the pre-existing tunnel of Line 1 (later renamed U2) was in a bad condition and necessitated extensive repair works. After Bismarckstra√üe, 23 houses had to be underpinned, therefore the shield drive was used for tunnelling this section. The stage from Fehrbelliner Platz to Richard-Wagner-Platz was put into operation on 28 April 1978. Earthworks and some motorway construction began at Charlottenburg-Nord on 3 July 1967, which is located at Siemensstadt. Construction began for the section to Rohrdamm from 1973. The construction work for the next section towards Spandau began in 1973. The route leads north of the station Richard-Wagner-Platz further under the S√∂mmeringstra√üe. Halfway to Mierendorffplatz, the Spree is underpassed using the caisson construction method. After a few meters, the station follows Mierendorffplatz. North of the station, the route makes a wide berth to reach the existing S-Bahn station Jungfernheide. Here, similar to the station Schlo√üstra√üe, the platforms were built on two levels. The other tracks are kept until today for a possible extension of the U5, which is to lead from Lehrter to Tegel Airport via Turmstra√üe and Jungfernheide. However, the plan was cancelled due to the budget situation, the longer length of the extension north of Jungfernheide station due to the planned closure of Tegel Airport. Trams will be replacing the U-Bahn extension. The finished extension is now used for firefighting exercises and is no longer usable for any future line. The extension to Rohrdamm followed on 1 October 1980, providing the district of Spandau with its first underground connection. The costs of the extension to the Spandau city centre rose to unexpected heights: it consumed 680 million German marks as a result of the need to undercut the Havel river and the swampy ground in the surrounding area. Construction began on 4 July 1977. Several variants were investigated. One plan was to lead the subway through the Haselhorster village center, with a downside that the Havel had to be undercut at one of its widest points. Another variant was that the subway would cross the existing Spandau suburban railway of the S-Bahn and the subway would be led from the south to Spandau city hall. This plan crystallized very late, as the 200-kilometer plan envisaged to lead the U7 over Falkenseer Platz into Falkenhagener Feld. This resulted in the disadvantage that the Spandau old town could not be connected, which was the main goal of the extension. Finally, they decided to continue the route along the Nonnendammallee or the street Am Juliusturm, south past the Spandau Citadel and then directly to the old town and on to the Spandau town hall, with the development of Falkenhagener Feld taken over by the extension of the small profile route of the line U2 of Ruhleben. On 1 October 1984, the last section of the U7 from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau was opened, with the then Federal Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl, in attendance. Future plans In 2014, the Berlin city government published the Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plan, according to which the long-postponed northern extension of the U7 to Staaken is expected to begin construction in 2021 and be completed in 2025. A southern extension from Rudow to Berlin Brandenburg Airport via Neuhofer Stra√üe, Lieselotte-Berger-Stra√üe, and Sch√∂nefeld has already been shelved as the expected patronage was not high enough to justify such an expansion. However, in light of the ballot measure aimed at keeping Tegel Airport open after the opening of the new Brandenburg Airport, governing mayor Michael M√ºller suggested an extension of U7 towards Sch√∂nefeld and/or the new airport which was greeted with enthusiasm by local politicians in Sch√∂nefeld and the Berlin district of Neuk√∂lln. Line colour and name In 1966, the branched C line had a violet map colour. After it was separated from the rest of the line and line names were changed from letters to numbers, this route was called (), and was represented by a grey line. After 1978, however, it was changed to a bright blue, because it is more easily discerned on the map. Since 1984, when all the underground lines received a \\"U\\" prefix, it has been called \\"U7\\". Station signages use the Helvetica font which is widely used in subway systems globally. In popular culture In March 2009, TML-Studios released 'World of Subways Vol. 2: U7 - Berlin' for Windows, which gives players the opportunity to operate a train on the U7 Line in either F90 or H01 rolling stock. References Further reading  Berlin U-Bahn lines ","title":"U7 (Berlin U-Bahn)"},{"id":"594650","text":"U8 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn. It has 24 stations and is long. The U8 is one of two north-south Berlin U-Bahn lines, and runs from Wittenau to Neuk√∂lln via Gesundbrunnen. The original proposal was for a suspended monorail like the Wuppertal Schwebebahn.  Colouring and naming  left The U8 line has had dark blue as its distinguishing colour since it first opened in 1927. It initially ran between Gesundbrunnen and Neuk√∂lln and was therefore known as the GN-Bahn. Until 1966 it was designated the D line; when the U-Bahn then changed to a numeric designation system, it was renamed Line 8. In 1984, the letter U was added as part of efforts to better distinguish the S-Bahn from the U-Bahn.  History  = Gesundbrunnen to Neuk√∂lln: the GN-Bahn = Leinestra√üe station on the U8 line In 1902, a Nuremberg company, the Continentale Gesellschaft f√ºr elektrische Unternehmungen, approached Berlin's executive council, the Magistrat, about building a monorail like the one that had already been built in Elberfeld-Barmen (now part of Wuppertal). Their preferred route ran from Gesundbrunnen to Rixdorf (later renamed Neuk√∂lln). However, the Magistrat and city council were sceptical about the project, above all fearing accidents. In 1907, AEG made a competing proposal for almost the same route, in the form of an underground line within the city and an elevated railway in the suburban districts. After lengthy negotiations, in March 1912 the City of Berlin and AEG finally agreed upon a contract for the construction and operation of the line. Agreement was ultimately reached under considerable time pressure, because planning authority in matters of transport was to pass in April 1912 to the Greater Berlin Association and their position on this project was undetermined. The line was to begin as elevated track on Schwedenstra√üe and then continue to Humboldthain via Badstra√üe. From there it would run underground to Hermannplatz via Brunnenstra√üe, Rosenthaler Stra√üe, Weinmeisterstra√üe, M√ºnzstra√üe, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra√üe, Neue Friedrichstra√üe, Br√ºckenstra√üe, Neanderstra√üe, Dresdener Stra√üe, Luisenufer, Reichenberger Stra√üe, Kottbusser Stra√üe and Kottbusser Damm. AEG intended to build the line for the wider of the two train formats, known as Gro√üprofil (large profile), like the first north-south line. Construction began in 1912. Like Siemens, AEG had formed a subsidiary elevated railway company, AEG-Schnellbahn-AG. However, in the short period before and during the First World War, only a few tunnel sections were completed, among them the tunnel under the River Spree, between the Waisenbr√ºcke and the Jannowitzbr√ºcke. Finally, AEG's financial situation became so difficult that they ceased all construction work in October 1919. Thereupon the City of Berlin brought a successful legal action against AEG, as a result of which AEG-Schnellbahn-AG was liquidated. The city then received all the tunnel sections which had been built and planned to complete the line itself, but was at the time still in the process of constructing the first north-south U-Bahn. At that time plans were considered for eventually extending the line, some of them adventurous, for example a connection to the Heidekrautbahn railway to the north and another to the Neuk√∂lln-Mittenwald Railway to the south, so that theoretically a mass transit line would have been created extending from Gro√ü Sch√∂nebeck in Schorfheide through Berlin to Mittenwalde. Work did not resume on the GN-Bahn until 1926. The change of oversight had advantages for Berlin, because it made it possible to correct some sections of the route, for example, the northern elevated section, which was entirely eliminated, and the location of the tunnel at the Alexanderplatz. The first work was on the southern portion of the GN-Bahn, so that service began on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstra√üe and Sch√∂nleinstra√üe. Between these stations was the Hermannplatz station, which had been built as part of the simultaneous construction of the first north-south U-Bahn, finished 4 years earlier; here passengers were now for the first time able to transfer from one \\"large profile\\" (wide-body) line to another. A switching track was built between the two. Construction then progressed north. At the Kottbusser Tor station, the existing elevated station was relocated to make changing trains easier. Operation of the trunk line continued on wooden trestles. It now seemed natural to continue the line via Dresdener Stra√üe and the Oranienplatz to Neanderstra√üe (now Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe) - perhaps too natural: the stretch to Kottbusser Tor would have been very short. In addition, noting the Karstadt store at Hermannplatz, the Wertheim department store had realised the advantages of a connection to the U-Bahn and reputedly paid 5 million Reichsmarks for a change in the plans. The GN-Bahn would now be diverted to Moritzplatz and then round a sharp curve to Neanderstra√üe. So Wertheim in Moritzplatz also acquired an entrance from the U-Bahn. The shell of a station at Oranienplatz, which had already been constructed by AEG, remains unused to the present day.Oranienplatz on Florian Schulz' Berlins blinde Verkehrsbauten site, retrieved 18 October 2010 After Moritzplatz, the route follows the Neanderstra√üe and provisionally terminated at the station of that name (renamed Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe in 1960). The segment between Sch√∂nleinstra√üe and Neanderstra√üe was opened on 12 February 1928 as far as Kottbusser Tor and on 6 April of the same year to Neanderstra√üe. A year later, an additional station opened south of Boddinstra√üe, Leinestra√üe (in August 1929). Beyond the Neanderstra√üe station was the previously constructed tunnel under the Spree. However, since this needed to be altered and the Jannowitzbr√ºcke was in bad condition, a completely new bridge was constructed with a new U-Bahn crossing beneath it. The old tunnel was later put to use for a service connection between the U5 and U8 (sometimes called the \\"orphan tunnel\\"). Alexanderplatz station: an early underground shopping arcade The U-Bahn construction at Alexanderplatz took a long time, because the opportunity was taken to completely re-design the square. Some adjustments were also made to the line of the route, and the GN-Bahn thus appreciably better integrated into the remainder of the public transport system. At Alexanderplatz, a large transfer terminal was created for the U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses. At that time also, the so-called \\"mother of all underground shopping concourses\\" was created. Today, in contrast, it seems rather small in comparison to, for example, the arcade at the Hauptwache station in Frankfurt. Alexanderplatz station now has the form of an 'H'. The eastern leg of the 'H' is the U-Bahn station already opened in 1913 for what is today the U2. The western leg is the GN-Bahn station (today the U8). The crosspiece is the U-Bahn under the Frankfurter Allee, then under construction. Two platforms were built, used by what is today the U5 and projected to be used by a planned line from Potsdamer Platz to Weissensee. There were no further major problems; for the most part, AEG tunnels already existed. The section from Neanderstra√üe to Gesundbrunnen opened on 18 April 1930. As with the other wide-format line, operation was transferred to the elevated railway company. = Dividing Berlin into two: 1961-1990 = After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, on the orders of German Democratic Republic interior minister Karl Maron all U8 stations inside East Berlin were closed to passenger traffic. This order turned all remaining closed stations into so-called \\"ghost stations\\", through which trains were required to pass without stopping and which could only be entered by East German border and traffic policemen. These stations were closed: Bernauer Stra√üe, Rosenthaler Platz, Weinmeisterstra√üe, Alexanderplatz, Jannowitzbr√ºcke and Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe from 13 August 1961 till the fall of the Berlin Wall. To serve the area formerly connected by U8 for the East Berlin, a bus line 78 was introduced from Arkonaplatz to M√§rkisches Museum. After the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the U8 line was not in great shape. It began with 6 stations in West Berlin, followed by an equally long section underneath East Berlin ('ghost stations') and ended at Gesundbrunnen after 2 more stations in the western sector. As a result, the line was of little use for public transport, and was also potentially open to disruption by the GDR. In 1962, plans were known for a new residential district in West Berlin, the M√§rkisches Viertel. Like Gropiusstadt, this ought naturally to have U-Bahn service. The S-Bahn to Frohnau, which passed nearby, was ignored; West Berliners boycotted it because it was operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, an arm of the GDR government,T.H. Elkins with B. Hofmeister, Berlin: The Spatial Structure of a Divided City, London: Methuen, 1988, , e-edition Taylor & Francis 2005, , p. 106. plus the East Germans did not have money to spend building a new station.Elkins, p. 173. After extensive deliberation, it was decided to extend the U8. When Line 9 was extended to Osloer Stra√üe, a lower-level platform for the U8 was constructed at the same time. Work on that extension began in 1973, and the extension was opened on 5 October 1977. Pankstra√üe's other purpose as an emergency shelter is hardly discernible Beyond the Gesundbrunnen station, the line continues under Badstra√üe. At the junction with Pankstra√üe a station with the same name was constructed. The Pankstra√üe U-Bahn station was constructed to be usable as a shelter (e.g. in case of war). To this end Pankstra√üe has sanitary facilities, an emergency kitchen, a filtered ventilation system, et c. In an emergency it can shelter 3,339 people. The additional costs for these facilities were paid by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The walls are tiled in brown and the columns clad in aluminium sheeting. One curiosity remains at Pankstra√üe station: the silver letters affixed to the walls spell the name as \\"Pankstrasse\\", transliterating the eszett and ignoring the correct German spelling (\\"Pankstra√üe\\"). The line continues along Schwedenstra√üe to the previously prepared Osloer Stra√üe station. A service track was added here so that trains can also be transferred from the U8 to the U9. Residenzstra√üe station are intended to recall carpets in the now destroyed Stadtschlo√ü Not until 10 years later, on 27 April 1987, was it possible to open the next section of the line, to Paracelsus-Bad (construction had begun on 12 September 1980). The extensions on the other lines had proceeded significantly faster; here work lasted an unusually long time. After Osloer Stra√üe station, the line continues along Schwedenstra√üe, which changes its name to Residenzstra√üe shortly before it intersects Reginardstra√üe. A station was built near the Sch√§fersee lake. There were many disputes over what to name it; the name finally agreed upon is Franz-Neumann-Platz (Am Sch√§fersee) (Franz-Neumann- Platz (at the Sch√§fersee). Like the following stations on the line, this station bears the unmistakable stamp of station architect Rainer R√ºmmler. On its walls are trees, intended to symbolise the parkland surrounding the lake. To better integrate the line into the district of Reinickendorf, it then detours slightly, not continuing beneath the industrial area to the Wilhelmsruh S-Bahn station, but instead taking a route via the Karl Bonhoeffer Neuropsychiatric Clinic and the Reinickendorf town hall. It then continues under Residenzstra√üe, where again a station of that name was built, makes a wide curve under the junction of Residenzstra√üe and Lindauer Allee, and a few hundred metres later comes to the Paracelsus-Bad station. Paracelsus-Bad station is intended to be reminiscent of a swimming pool The Residenzstra√üe station, intended to be reminiscent of the Berlin Imperial palace, is decorated with plans of the now destroyed Stadtschlo√ü. The supporting pillars are decorated in very bright colours and probably intended to evoke the rich carpets of the residence. Paracelsus-Bad station was designed to evoke associations with the nearby swimming baths. In addition there are pictures on the wall, one of which shows the doctor and philosopher Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim). This new section of the line was actually intended to be inaugurated on the precise 750th anniversary of the city of Berlin, 30 April 1987. However, since the festivities that day were to begin with a celebration at the ICC, the then Executive Mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, would not be able to attend and hence the opening was brought forward by 3 days. Once more, a long time passed before the next extension of the line towards M√§rkisches Viertel. It was 1994 before it was possible to take the U8 to the Wittenau S-Bahn station. = Completion of the U8 = Wittenau station, provisional and probably eventual terminus of the line The residents of M√§rkisches Viertel had been promised a U-Bahn connection ever since the late 1960s. After examination of several options, the decision was to extend the U8. By 1987, two stages in this extension had been completed: Gesundbrunnen ‚Äì Osloer Stra√üe and Osloer Stra√üe ‚Äì Paracelsus-Bad. The third stage still remained to be built. After the BVG took over operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin and the Frohnau section of line was reopened on 1 October 1984, there was increasing criticism of the U8 extension, which would run almost parallel to the S-Bahn. However, the Senate of West Berlin was not to be dissuaded and resumed construction on the U-Bahn. Even a directive from the government of the Federal Republic in Bonn to instead invest in badly needed renovations of the S-Bahn, coupled with a warning that subsidies to Berlin would be reduced, was dismissed with the argument that cessation of the U-Bahn construction would cause severe economic harm to the city. Construction began on 27 February 1985, while the preceding segment of the U8 was also still under construction. The intended terminus of the third stage of the line extension was Wilhelmsruher Damm, near the Wittenau S-Bahn station. This was apparently to distinguish the U-Bahn from the S-Bahn. Only shortly before dedication of the new segment did the Senate correct the name of the station, which has since been called Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm), but is commonly known simply as Wittenau. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, three stations were opened simultaneously - Bernauer Stra√üe, Rosenthaler Platz and Jannowitzbr√ºcke. Station restoration was started after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and all the former ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù had been opened by 1 July 1990. After Paracelsus-Bad, the line continues under Lindauer Allee to Lindauer Allee station, the only one on the U8 to have outside platforms. After a long curve, the U8 is running under the S-Bahn. The location of the next station requires a long walk to transfer between the two. There was also disagreement concerning the name of this station: the S-Bahn station at this point was called Wittenau (Kremmener Bahn), to distinguish it from Wittenau (Nordbahn) (which is now Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm) to match the U-Bahn station). The U-Bahn station was to be called Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik after the psychiatric clinic. This was a mouthful that was only slowly accepted. On the S-Bahn, to this day \\"Karl- Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik\\" is announced but the shorter \\"Karl-Bonhoeffer-Klinik\\" appears on signs. The subway line then continues under the clinic. To minimise disturbance, this stretch of tunnel was excavated using a shield, and rubber sound baffling was also needed. This attracted repeated criticism from those who would have preferred open tunnelling with shoring up of buildings. Other problems also arose during construction of this stretch of line: the Brandenburg sand made work particularly difficult and numerous oversized boulders (glacial erratics) caused delays. After Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik the U8 turns onto Eichborndamm, where the Rathaus Reinickendorf station was built. 1,101 m further, it reaches its current and probably ultimate terminus, Wittenau. The intention still remains today to extend this line to M√§rkisches Viertel. However, as with other U-Bahn construction projects, the extreme budgetary crisis in the state of Berlin is preventing further construction. The completed extension, which is long and comprises 4 new stations, was opened on 24 September 1994. Construction cost 600 million DM. As with other newly built sections of the U-Bahn in this period, Rainer R√ºmmler was responsible for the design of the stations. Critics say that this section would represent his peak, but that R√ºmmler had a tendency to excess. This is particularly evident in the Lindauer Allee station, where he primarily made use of the symbol on the coat of arms of the city of Lindau, the linden tree. At the Wittenau U-Bahn station, the colours green and yellow were supposed to radiate a certain peace, which he associated with the intended station name Wilhelmsruher Damm. Hermannstra√üe station, planned since 1910 Plans for a U-Bahn to the Hermannstra√üe S-Bahn station had existed since 1910. When the so-called GN-Bahn was opening in stages between 1927 and 1930, plans to extend it were not abandoned. The first work on a southwards extension began in 1929; but the economic crisis prevented its continuation. Ultimately, the City of Berlin cancelled the project in 1931. At that point, the tunnel from the Leinestra√üe station and approximately one third of the future platform for the Hermannstra√üe station had been completed. In 1940 the station, still only a shell, was converted into an air-raid shelter, since it was located very deep underground because the line crossed under the Ringbahn, which at this point runs in a cutting. To this day, relics in the station recall that time. After 1961, the extension plans were no longer pursued, since there was no demand for transfer capability to the S-Bahn, operated by the GDR's Reichsbahn. BVG used the stubs of tunnel which had already been built to park surplus trains. After reunification in 1990, many things seemed possible. The S-Bahn Ringbahn, shut down by the Reichsbahn after a 1980 strike, was to be re-opened. The re- opening was scheduled for 17 December 1993, which meant that the Senate and BVG had to work very fast, because construction had to begin on the U-Bahn before the Ringbahn re-opened. During work on the station, the trains which had been parked there in the 1960s were discovered. Many U-Bahn fans were delighted that one of the discoveries was an antique BI train. The work included renovation of the old tunnel and existing platform section as well as construction of the remainder of the platform and a 320-meter turnaround beyond it to the south. In addition, transfer access to the S-Bahn platform above and possible stairways to a planned regional station had to be accommodated. Hermanstra√üe station dating to its conversion into an air-raid shelter in 1940 Finally, on 13 July 1996, the 168th Berlin U-Bahn station opened. Here too, Rainer R√ºmmler was responsible for the design of the station, incidentally for the last time. He referred very strongly to the stations on the preceding stretch of line and designed a very sparse station lined with turquoise tiles. So that the historic shelter signs would remain visible, glass was substituted for the tiles in some places. With the commissioning of this station, the U8 reached what is up to now its final form. Even though an extension to M√§rkisches Viertel is planned, it is unlikely that it will become a reality for decades. The previously planned extension towards Britz was cancelled because the U7 follows a parallel route. Frequency U8 trains run every five minutes, with the exception of the stretch between Paracelsus-Bad and Wittenau, where they run every ten minutes. Since 2003, the U8 also runs at night on the weekends. During weekdays, the N8 bus replaces the train service during night hours.

The line was opened on 28 August 1961 as Line G. Route The path of the U9 is completely under-surface. It starts in the north at Osloer Stra√üe in Gesundbrunnen and runs through Wedding before underpassing the Berlin Ringbahn and running through Moabit, reaching Hansaplatz and Tiergarten before crossing the Berlin Stadtbahn at the Zoo and Kurf√ºrstendamm, eventually leaving western central Berlin by heading to Friedenau and finally Steglitz at Rathaus Steglitz. History =First stage of construction= After the division of Berlin in 1948, the citizens of West Berlin preferred buses and trams that bypassed East Berlin. Furthermore, the highly populated boroughs of Steglitz, Wedding and Reinickendorf were in need of a rapid transit relation to the new center of West Berlin south of the Zoo. This prompted the construction of a completely new line, then called line G, becoming the third north-south line after line C (modern U6) and line D (modern U8). Ground-breaking was on 23 June 1955 at Tiergarten. Path construction was difficult as it was to underpass four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U6), two S-Bahn lines (Stadtbahn, Ringbahn twice) and three waterways (Spree River, Landwehr Canal, Berlin-Spandau Canal). Line G from Leopoldplatz to Spichernstra√üe was supposed to be opened 2 September 1961. This was backdated to 28 August 1961 after the construction of the Berlin Wall proved the necessity of this new line. To accommodate the U9, the N√ºrnberger Platz station was closed. It was replaced by Spichernstra√üe (opened 2 June 1959) and Augsburger Stra√üe (opened 8 May 1961) stations respectively. The new stations do include: *Leopoldplatz (today: U6) *Amrumer Stra√üe *Putlitzstra√üe (today: Westhafen; S-Bahn /Ringbahn) *Birkenstra√üe *Turmstra√üe *Hansaplatz *Zoologischer Garten (heute: U2; S-Bahn /Stadtbahn) *Kurf√ºrstendamm (today: U1) *Spichernstra√üe (today: U3) It will also interchange with the smaller profile station, but it was opened at the same day when U9 is opened: *Kurf√ºrstendamm =Second stage= Since the subsidies from the Federal Republic still went to West Berlin, was further built on the busy subway. On 29 January 1971, the longest subway extensions was implemented. The U7 takes the lead of the M√∂ckernbr√ºcke to Fehrbelliner Platz, Line 9 of the Spichernstra√üe to Walther-Schreiber-Platz. Nine kilometers of track with eleven new stations went into operation on that day. Groundbreaking began 1 July 1962. For the Steglitz and Neuk√∂lln a fast connection to the western center and no longer had the buses in claim take. The route follows the U9 from the previous terminus Spichernstra√üe the Bundesallee and crosses line U7 on Berliner Stra√üe. The lower platform is a central platform, the U9 has here. This however is not in the usual sense: On one side of the platform, climb‚Äîat the station Berliner Stra√üe usually on the right side, but on the left side‚Äîseen in the direction of travel. It could also be seen as apart Laid central platforms the platforms thus. Only one transition at the north end of both platforms interconnects. This construction project was necessary because the subway construction, a road tunnel between the two side platforms was built. Similar to the Berliner Stra√üe railway station also encloses the then- newly-built Bundesplatz a road tunnel, which is why no central platform was also built here. The tracks split up shortly before the station to bypass the tunnel and there were two side platforms. All stations were built designed by Rainer G. R√ºmmler. Here, instead of the current ceramic tiles, large-format colorful fiber cement plates are used, such as the station Walther-Schreiber- Platz. Even should associations by the color scheme is always new are awakened. From Bahnhof Berliner Stra√üe, the colors are white and red on the Coat of arms of Berlin remember, at the station Eisenacher Stra√üe U7 the green faces on the Thuringian Forest at Eisenach. Another reason why the architect is very controversial. =Final extension= Between Walther-Schreiber-Platz station and the Schlo√üstra√üe the U9 changes to the tunnel section of U10. In Schlo√üstra√üe station itself, the tracks are heading north on the top, in the direction of Rathaus Steglitz on the lower level, however, the offices on the eastern edge of the platform on which was supposed to take the U10. The western edge of the platform each is separated by a fence from the passenger traffic. In track trough unused tracks are laid without power rail. To date, there hangs the sign \\"No trains\\". By this enormous constructed provisions, the cost of one meter underground route exorbitantly to 78,000 Mark (adjusted for purchasing power in today's money). Behind the Schlo√üstra√üe ends the U9 at the Rathaus Steglitz. The paths of U9 and U10 here separate again. Both lines should keep in Steglitz at separate stations, viewed from Schlo√üstra√üe from an end opening \\"V\\" would form. The intended actually for the U9 station Part (Rzo) is equipped with side platforms, located in the minus-1 level until now has been completed only in the shell and is cut off as a storeroom for the civil protection used. The original platform is operated for the U9 instead of planned for the U10 Station part (Rzu) in the minus-2 level. Background for this management is the intersection of planned U9-line and Wannseebahn immediately south of the station. In the 1970s, it has not been possible, Deutsche Reichsbahn in the negotiations on the railway line to the to come, the operation of the Steglitz station here an agreement. So as the sweeping system, the BVG considered behind the station for necessary not be created. In the west extending U10 there was not this problem, which is why the U9 has been carried out on the U10 route and provided with a reversing facility. When in January 1984 on the operation went right for the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the BVG, the chance to drive under the S-Bahn, without risking renewed problematic negotiations with the Reichsbahn offered. Since this condition was guaranteed from the perspective of 1984, only ten years (so long was the contract period), the mid-1980s the functionless tunnel was extended through under the railway embankment. A reversing facility or at least one part of it is not built into this piece‚Äîthis should be done only in a further section of the tunnel. The section to Rathaus Stegliz was definitely opened on 30 September 1974, its construction began on 7 July 1969. The addition is from Leopoldplatz to Osloer Stra√üe. It was opened on the 30 April 1976, construction began on 6 November 1969. Since this was not feasible but due to the political situation, they let the U9 only to cross Osloer Stra√üe/Swedener Stra√üe construct. They were provided for two new stations: Nauener Platz, Turmstra√üe, and Osloer Stra√üe. Until then, the U8 can be extended. This resulted in the situation that this tower station could be built without regard to existing underground services. It has also helped build a spacious, bright basement distribution, in which there are several shops and snack bars. Future Extensions In the old 200 km it was planned to be extended via Filandastra√üe, Halskestra√üe, Lankwitz and Lankwitz Kirche, and may be planned to be extended to Lichterfelde Ring via Gallwitzallee, Blankenhainer Stra√üe, Maximilian-Kaller-Stra√üe and Hildburghauser Stra√üe, directly planned to the Berlin external boundary area. The further northern extension was dropped after the fall of the Berlin Wall in favour of tram line M13. The route was suggested to go via Holzstra√üe, Wollankstra√üe and will be divided into two options - *Going to Pankow Kirche, it will be via Rathaus Pankow, Pankow Kirche, Hadlichestra√üe and towards Quartier am Pankower Tor *Going to Pankow, it will be via Florapromenade, Pankow, Neumannstra√üe and towards Quartier am Pankower Tor All of the extensions were abandoned as the patronage is not high enough to justify for these expansion.

It opened during the Victorian era, in 1885, replacing earlier stations situated a little further west. Since the closure of the former Rugby Central station on the now-abandoned Great Central Railway route through the town, it is Rugby's only station. Between 1950 and 1970 the station was known as Rugby Midland before reverting to its original title. The station underwent an extensive upgrade during 2006‚Äì2008, with extra platforms added, and a new ticket office and entrance building constructed, however the original Victorian part of the station was retained in the upgrade. Rugby station is at the centre of two important junctions of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) connecting London to Birmingham and North West England and Scotland. The junction of the Trent Valley Line to the North West, and the Rugby-Birmingham- Stafford Line to Birmingham is a short distance west of the station. East of the station, the Northampton Loop Line diverges at a junction from the direct line to London. Until the 1960s it also had routes to , and but these have all since been closed.

However, as the WCML divides here on either side of the station, it provides an interchange between the routes and consequently many trains stop here. In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, the station is from Euston.Engineer's Line References RailwayCodes.org Hillmorton Junction To the southeast of the station, the original London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) line (opened 1838), which runs directly to London, is joined at a grade separated junction near Hillmorton by the Northampton loop line (opened 1881) which runs to Northampton before rejoining the line to London at Hanslope Junction. This junction is from Euston. Trent Valley Junction To the northwest of the station the WCML diverges again between the original London and Birmingham line, now referred to as the Birmingham Loop, which runs westwards to Coventry and Birmingham, and the Trent Valley Line (opened 1847) which diverges at a flyover junction northwestwards towards Stafford and the North West of England and Scotland. It is from Euston. =Closed Lines= Until the 1960s Rugby station served several other railway lines, which were closed mostly as part of the Beeching Axe. At one time railway lines diverged from Rugby station in seven different directions. The closed lines were: *The Midland Counties Railway (later Midland Railway) line to and the East Midlands which opened in 1840. In the mid-19th century this was an important main line, as the junction at Rugby provided the Midland Railway with its only link to London. Nearly all rail traffic between London and the north passed through Rugby, making it one of the most important railway junctions in the country. Increasing congestion at Rugby meant that Midland Railway opened its own route from Leicester to London in the late 1860s. The Leicester to Rugby line lost its earlier importance, and became little more than a country branch line, it continued to operate as such for nearly a century until it was closed on 30 December 1961. A remaining relic of this line locally is the disused viaduct across the Avon valley, which is a local landmark. *The Rugby and Stamford Railway which was a secondary cross-country line owned by the London and North Western Railway which ran from Rugby to Peterborough via . The line was opened on 29 April 1850. It originally ran to Stamford where it joined the Midland Railway's Syston and Peterborough Railway. But later on, in order to gain a more direct route, the LNWR gained permission to build a line from to the Northampton and Peterborough Railway near Wansford, part of which survives as the Nene Valley Railway. Traffic was never heavy, and Doctor Beeching viewed it as an unnecessary duplication of the Birmingham to Peterborough Line and it was closed on 6 June 1966. *The Rugby to Leamington Line which was a country branch line to Leamington Spa which was opened on 1 March 1851. Local passenger services were withdrawn in 1959, and the line closed as a through route in 1966. The Great Central Main Line (GCML) also ran through the town and had its own station at , but as this was built by a rival company, it never had any connection to the other railways in Rugby. It was opened in 1899 and closed between 1966 and 1969.  History  =First station (1838‚Äì40)= The first railway station to be built in Rugby was a wooden temporary structure located around half a mile to the west of the present station. It opened on 9 April 1838 when the London and Birmingham Railway was constructed. However great difficulty in constructing the Kilsby Tunnel in Northamptonshire delayed the full opening of the line, which was not finished in time for the coronation of Queen Victoria on 28 June 1838. Aware of the lucrative traffic the event would generate, the company opened the north end of the line, between Birmingham and Rugby, and the south end from London to a temporary station at near Bletchley, with a stagecoach shuttle service linking the two parts to allow through journeys to London. The line was officially fully opened on 17 September 1838, with the first passenger train from London to Birmingham arriving that day. The original station was located on the western side of where the railway crossed Newbold Road (the Rugby to Leicester turnpike road, now the A426) because at the time this was the only road north from Rugby. =Second station (1840‚Äì1885)= The first station lasted only a few years. When a junction was made with the Midland Counties Railway in 1840, a new station was built at the site of the junction, which opened on 4 July 1840; it was to the east of the original station, and to the west of the present station. A new road, Railway Terrace had to be built to link it to the town centre, because at the time it was located in open countryside. This second station was effectively managed by two companies ‚Äì the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway ‚Äì and for this reason grew up in a haphazard fashion. It was at first no more than a temporary wooden structure, but was gradually rebuilt into a more permanent structure over the following decade. This station consisted of platforms at each side of the track with one bay platform. The platforms were rather low and passengers complained of having to perform an \\"acrobatic feat\\" to board trains. The station was at the centre of a busy junction and often saw chaotic scenes. It featured, only lightly disguised, in Charles Dickens's story Mugby Junction. = The present station (1885‚Äì) = Rugby Station in 1917 The station in 1959 The second station lasted until the 1880s, when a new line from Rugby to Northampton (the Northampton loop) was built, the old station was deemed by the LNWR to be no- longer satisfactory, and in 1882, ¬£70,000 was allocated to replace it with the current station which opened on 5 July 1885. Another ¬£30,000 was allocated to build a hotel, although this was never built. The Midland Railway retained the part of the older station which it had managed, however. One platform of the old station, separate from the new station, continued to be used by local trains on the Midland Railway's branch to Leicester until 8 March 1930. No trace of this now remains, however, as it was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the postal sorting office. When constructed the station consisted of one large island platform with bay platforms at each end for terminating local services. The main island platforms are accessed from a tunnel at road level and a ramp leading to the platforms. When constructed the station had a large steel and glass trainshed roof which consisted of 117 ft (35.6 m) wide spans on each side, covering the station platforms and tracks. Originally the sides of the station had glass side screens but these were later removed. The condition of the roof deteriorated, and in the 1980s the glass over the tracks was removed, and finally the entire structure was dismantled in 2000 when it became unstable, and was replaced with modern canopies over the platforms.Rugby local history.org A electric multiple unit at one of the former northbound bay platforms at Rugby in 1975. The station had one of the longest platforms of any British railway station, at , but the two main island platforms were both shortened as part of the 2007‚Äì08 station upgrade. The platform was long enough to allow two trains to call at it at the same time. This unusual feature was enabled by 'scissors crossings' halfway along the platforms. The scissor crossings were X-shaped junctions which allowed one train to pass another one already in the platform, and call into the same platform ahead of it, and allowed the train to the rear to pull out of the station, effectively doubling the capacity of the platform. The scissor crossings remained in use until the railway was electrified in the 1960s. In 1899 a second station, , was opened in Rugby. To distinguish it from the other station, the present station became known as Rugby Midland. Rugby Central closed in 1969, and Rugby Midland reverted to being called just Rugby in 1970. The station came under the management of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) (1885‚Äì1923), and then the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) (1923‚Äì1948), and then the nationalised British Railways (1948‚Äì1997). It is now owned by Network Rail.  2006‚Äì2008 upgrade  As a part of the West Coast Main Line modernisation programme carried out by Network Rail, major track restructuring work was carried out to allow higher speed running through Rugby. Previously non-stopping trains passing through Rugby were limited to 75 mph, the track upgrades raised the speed to 125 mph, thus eliminating another bottleneck from the WCML. The station itself also underwent a major ¬£170 million upgrade which included:BBC Coventry and Warwickshire *The addition of three new through platforms, bringing the total up to five, including a new platform on the south side of the station and a second island platform on the north side. *The construction of a new entrance building and ticket office: Historically all of the station's facilities, including the ticket office were concentrated on the station's single island platform, which was accessed from street level by a subway. The main entrance to the station therefore consisted of a simple opening to the subway. The additional platforms required that the ticket office be moved to a new entrance building at the front of the station. It was at one time thought that remodelling of the track layout would entail complete demolition of the present station, but the final plans involved retention of the existing island platform and buildings. Work began in September 2006 and was completed late in 2008. The platform on the south side of the station opened for use on 29 May 2007, and as a result all of the platforms were renumbered. This platform became Platform 1, the former Platform 1 became Platform 2 and 2 became 4. The additional platforms on the north side of the station are numbered Platforms 5 and 6 and they opened on 27 August 2008. Platform 8 became Platform 3. At the same time the former westbound bay platforms originally numbered 3, 6 and 7 were removed. Another distinctive feature of the local railway landscape also vanished at this time ‚Äì the 'bird cage' bridge. This was a 'heavy' girder bridge of two substantial spans over the West Coast Main Line to the east ('up' side) of the station. This was the means by which the Great Central Main Line crossed the London & North Western Railway competing line.

Situated to the south of the station and erected in 1895, it spanned three tracks and carried forty-four semaphore arms. Every arm was duplicated due to sighting difficulties that resulted from the Great Central Railway's 'Birdcage' bridge crossing the WCML behind the gantry's location. The gantry acquired the nickname of \\"the Rugby Bedstead\\" on account of its appearance. The \\"Rugby Bedstead\\" signalling gantry in 1895, prior to the construction of the Great Central viaduct In 1939, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway resignalled the Rugby area with colour light signals, although the mechanical signal boxes were retained. The famous signal gantry became redundant, following which it was divided up into smaller pieces to form a number of smaller structures for re-use elsewhere. SGE was awarded a contract to resignal the Rugby area in preparation for electrification. Rugby Power Signal Box (PSB) opened in 1964. It is located east of the station, on the south (Down) side of the railway. The whole station area, together with part of the WCML stretching as far south as Castlethorpe, was controlled from this new box. It was equipped with an 'NX' (entrance-exit) panel. In 1991, Rugby PSB took over control of the Northampton area using Solid State Interlocking (SSI). Rugby PSB closed in May 2012 when control of Northampton was transferred to Rugby SCC. Rugby Signalling Control Centre (SCC), located north-west of the station, opened in 2004. Initially, its area of control was limited to a portion of the WCML between Kings Langley and Linslade Tunnel. The current area of control is Kings Langley, Hertfordshire to Armitage in Staffordshire. Area of control also includes small portions of branch lines around Nuneaton; these include the Coventry-Nuneaton (from Three Spires to Nuneaton) and part of the Arley/Hinckley lines (Arley Tunnel to Padge Hall). In March 2016, the WCML South Rail Operating Centre (ROC) was opened at Rugby ‚Äì this will supervise the signalling on the entire southern end of the WCML and associated branch routes.Network Rail ‚Äì Our Future Vision Network Rail Media Centre press release; Retrieved 2013-08-30 =Motive Power Depots= Inside the Repair Shops at Rugby Locomotive Depot in 1953 A shed for three locomotives was opened here in 1838 by the London and Birmingham Railway and another in 1847. These were demolished to make way for two larger sheds in 1852, one for the use of the Northern Division locomotives and one by the Southern Division. The LNWR replaced these with a single 12-road shed in 1876, which was closed in 1965, but used for stabling diesel shunters. An adjoining 12-road shed was opened in 1886, but was closed and demolished by British Railways in 1960.  Connections  Bus route 4, operated by Stagecoach Midlands, connects the railway station with Rugby town centre and the suburbs of Cawston and Bilton. Bus route D1 and D2, operated by Stagecoach Midlands, previously connected the railway station with Rugby town centre, now replaced on this section by services 1 and 2, which connects with buses D1 and D2 to the suburbs of Barby, Braunston, Brownsover, DIRFT, Hillmorton, and Kilsby. The service then continues onto serve the nearby town of Daventry.
