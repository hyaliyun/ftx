Completed in 1921, it is a significant local example of Renaissance Revival architecture, designed by the prominent local firm of Berenson and Moses. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Ambassador Apartments are located in Hartford's Asylum Hill neighborhood, just west of its downtown, on the north side of Farmington Avenue west of its junction with Sigourney Street. It is a large H-shaped building, five stories in height, its exterior consisting of load-bearing brick and cast stone walls. The front building corners consist of brick pilasters with stone capitals, with a pressed metal cornice at the roof line. The ground floor functions visually as an elevated basement, with banded stone between rectangular window openings, and round-arch entrances in the courtyard between the building wings. Second-floor windows are set in openings with bracketed cornices and sills. The complex was built between 1917 and 1921 to a design by the prominent local architectural firm Berenson and Moses. The property was until 1912 part of the mansion estate of Pliny Jewell, owner of a local belt manufacturer. When built, its 128 apartments featured all of the latest amenities, including a parking garage for tenant vehicles and a dining hall seating 300. The then-furnished northeast wing was damaged by fire in 1920; damage was limited by firewalls, but delayed completion of the entire building. Nicolo Carabillo, the developer, failed to turn a profit, and sold the building in 1925 to avoid foreclosure. By the 1970s the building had declined in grandeur, and was acquired by the Aetna Insurance Company, whose headquarters are nearby. Aetna sold the building in 1999 after completing extensive rehabilitation to its apartments.

He is regarded as a leading pioneer of the European Social Catholicism movement.  Life  Caspar Decurtins was born in Trun, a small village in the Romansh speaking western part of the canton. His father, Laurenz Christian Decurtins, was a physician and one of the local land owners. His mother, born Margaretha Katharina Latour, also came from a prominent family in the Vorderrhein (literally: \\"pre-Rhine\\") valley. The politician Caspar de Latour (1827-1861) was a paternal uncle. He attended Gymnasium (secondary school) in Disentis and Chur, before moving to Germany in 1875 to conclude his university-level studies. He studied History, Art history and Civil Law at Munich and Heidelberg where after just three (half-year) terms he received his doctorate in 1876. His doctoral work concerned the seventeenth century Grisons Landammann (\\"chief magistrate\\") Nikolaus Maissen. He then spent a term at Strasbourg. In political terms, he had grown up in the liberal enlightenment ambience of his mother's family, the Latours. He showed early evidence of his own political commitment in 1874, however, when he was expelled from the Swiss \\"Zofinger\\" students' association while still in Chur, after he showed his support for Ultramontanism. In 1875, he joined an alternative student association, the Schweizerischer Studentenverein. Decurtin returned to Grisons in 1877 and immediately involved himself in politics. On 6 May 1877, despite his youth, he was proposed for election by around 1,300 eligible voters and elected to the Cantonal parliament (\\" Grosse Rat\\" / \\"Grand Conseil\\"), representing the Cadi electoral district and remaining a member till 1904. In the cantonal assembly he took a leadership role within the Catholic-Conservative faction, today seen as the principal forerunner of the Christian Democratic People's Party. Following the 1881 national election he was elected a member of the lower house of the Swiss Federal (i.e. national) parliament. A principal focus of his contributions was in the area of social reform. In the national parliament (as in the cantonal one) his was a forceful presence, but he was resolutely non-tribal in his political approach, happy to oppose laissez-faire economic doctrines then in fashion with fellow conservatives, and to work with liberals and socialists in pursuit of social catholic objectives. \\"Hunger is neither catholic nor protestant\\", as he pointed out.\\" La faim n'est ni catholique ni protestante. C'est pourquoi quiconque pr√™te son concours √† la solution de ces questions, doit √™tre le bienvenu, de quelque confession religieuse qu'il fasse partie, qu'il appartienne √† l'√©cole de Bakounine ou de Lassalle, ou bien croie au contraire √† l'Evangile du Christ \\"'Caspar Decurtins addressing the Congr√®s d'Aarau ca 1888 He joined up with Georges Favon, the radical member from Geneva, to draft and argue for a motion supporting an international law for the protection of workers. His willingness to work with \\"the left\\" was believed to be out of keeping with his catholic ultramontane convictions, and attracted lively criticism from within his own party. There were socially progressive measures that he backed, designed to protect the most socially disadvantaged members of society. He supported half-day working on Saturdays and the establishment of Sunday as a day of rest. On the other hand, he staunchly opposed other \\"left- wing\\" goals including railway nationalisation, creation of a Swiss national bank or public subsidy for schools, always fearful of state intervention in school affairs. Locally, after 1877 he teamed up with Placi Condrau to campaign for the preservation of Disentis Abbey, which had been threatened with closure, as was the fate of many religious houses in Switzerland at this time. A cantonal referendum to preserve the foundation having been won, he then back a campaign to fund and implement its restoration. He was a major force in the so-called black avalanche (\\"Lavina nera\\"), which was a political backlash against centralising tendencies within and beyond Grisons. Decurtins was a leading force in the Romansh revival. He was a co-founder of the \\"Romania\\" language association and producer of the \\"R√§toromanischen Chrestomathie\\", a 13 volume collection of Romansh literature and folk tales. He was also the driving force in the long running Cantonal Teaching Material Struggle which came to a head in 1900. He had arranged for the young priest, Maurus Carnot, to produce a volume of \\"Christian soul food\\" (\\"christliche Gesinnungsstoff\\") for the local schools school. It included a German translation of the story of Sigisbert of Disentis, an eighth century hermit credited with having founded what became Disentis Abbey. The book was introduced to the school replacing a German version of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" which Decurtins dismissed as \\"lightweight\\" (\\"zu seicht\\"). Then, in 1899 a version of the Sigisbert story, \\"Sigisbert en Rezia\\", was produced in Romansh. However, Sigisbert came up against the modernising agenda of the education administrators in the cantonal capital, Chur, who had implemented a major school reform in 1890, following the precepts of the influential education reformers Johann Friedrich Herbart and Tuiskon Ziller. It turned out that the prescriptive cantonal reforms included Robinson Crusoe, internationally admired at the time for his civilising credentials. Decurtins led support for the Sigisbert text in a sustained campaign that culminated in a mass meeting in the public assembly place in the main square at Ilanz (in the local language, \\"plaz cumin\\"). 2,700 people gathered, including 27 school governors, demanding use of the Sigisbert text and, at the same time, a pay increase for the teachers. The cantonal government backed down. Sigisbert was restored to the curriculum and the teachers received a pay increase.Sabrina Bundi: Wie ¬´Sigisbert en Rezia¬ª den Abenteurer Robinson zu Fall brachte, in: B√ºndner Tagblatt vom 12. M√§rz 2014, p. 6. In 1889 Decurtins worked with his friend Georges Python over the establishment of a University at Fribourg along the Franco-German language frontier to the west of Bern, described by one source as the university's \\"spiritual father\\", and according to another, personally interviewing and recruiting a number of the university's first professors. Although he remained a member of the national parliament till 1904, the tide of election results nationally during the 1890s was moving increasingly against his catholic conservative group, and he himself embarked on a parallel career teaching at the university where he was a professor till 1914. As a university professor he taught art history and was noted for his dislike of \\"modernism\\".

TVET uses formal, non-formal and informal learning. TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for social equity, inclusion and sustainable development.  Development of the term TVET  The term 'Technical and Vocational Education and Training or TVET was officiated at the World Congress on TVET in 1999 in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The congress recognised the term TVET to be broad enough to incorporate other terms that had been used to describe similar educational and training activities including Workforce Education (WE), and Technical- Vocational Education (TVE). The term TVET parallels other types of education and training e.g. Vocational Education but is also used as an umbrella term to encompass education and training activities. The decision in 1999 to officiate the term TVET led to the development of the UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in Bonn, Germany. Aims and Purposes of TVET Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) serves multiple purposes. A key purpose is preparation of youth for work. This takes the form of learning and developing work related skills and mastery of underlying knowledge and scientific principles. Work is broadly defined and therefore refers to both formal employment and self-employment. To support self-employment, TVET curricula often include entrepreneurship training. Related to this is the social reproduction and transformation of occupational and vocational practices. A related role is continuing professional development. The rapid technological changes demand that workers continuously update their knowledge and skills. Unlike the past where a job could be held for life, it is common place to change vocations several times. TVET enables that flexibility in two ways. One is providing broad based technical knowledge and transversal skills on which different occupations can be based on. The second is providing continuing vocational training to workers. In contrast with the industrial paradigm of the old economy, today's global economy lays the onus on the worker to continually reinvent himself or herself. In the past, workers were assured of a job for life, with full-time employment, clear occupational roles and well established career paths. This is no longer the case. The knowledge dependent global economy is characterized by rapid changes in technology and related modes of work. Often, workers find themselves declared redundant and out of work. TVET today has the responsibility of re- skilling such workers to enable them find and get back to work Apart from providing work related education, TVET is also a site for personal development and emancipation. These concerns the development of those personal capacities that relate to realizing one's full potential with regard to paid or self employment, occupational interests, and life goals outside of work. At the same time TVET seeks to enable individual overcome disadvantages due to circumstances of birth or prior educational experiences. From a development point of view, TVET facilitates economic growth by increasing the productivity of workers. The returns from increased output far exceed the costs of training, direct and indirect, leading to economic growth. TVET like any other form of education also facilitates socio-economic development by enhancing the capacity of individuals to adopt practices that are socially worthwhile. As a form of education similar to all others, TVET aims to developing the broad range of personal capabilities that characterize an educated person. Thus, the provision of broad based knowledge seeks to ensure critic-creative thinking. TVET also aims at developing capacities for effective communication and effective interpersonal relations.  Hybridisation  Because of TVET's isolation with other education streams it was not widely adopted, in particularly in secondary education. Steps were taken to reduce segmentation of education and training and to address institutional barriers that restricted TVET learners‚Ä≤ options including choices to move vertically to higher levels of learning, or horizontally to other streams. Policy-makers have introduced forms of hybridization with other education systems, additionally some of the distinctions between TVET and ‚Ä≤academic‚Ä≤ education streams have been blurred.Maclean, R. and Pavlova, M. 2011. Vocationalisation of secondary and higher education: pathways to the world of work. UNESCO- UNEVOC, Revisiting Global Trends in TVET: Reflections on Theory and Practice. Bonn, Germany, UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, pp. 40‚Äì85. This hybridisation has been termed the ‚Ä≤vocationalization of secondary education‚Ä≤, a similar process has happened to a lesser extent in tertiary education. = France and the Netherlands = The baccalaur√©at professionnel in France, and the middelbaar beroepsonderwijs (MBO) count work experience in the area they are specializing in. = Germany and Austria = Apprenticeships enhanced content within occupational training courses and considerable emphasis has been placed on personal skills. = India = Work education has been included in the primary standards (grades 1‚Äì8) to make the students aware of work. At the lower secondary level (grades 9‚Äì10) pre-vocational education has been included with the aim to increase students‚Äô familiarity with the world of work. = Republic of Korea = Around 40% of secondary students are currently enrolled in TVET education, in some schools, academic and vocational students share almost 75% of the curriculum. = Russian Federation = A new approach to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced within the framework of general educational reform. This has been guided by the Ministry of Education's strategy of modernization. Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for profile selection. Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g. science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum. In preparation for the upper-secondary specialization, a ‚Ä≤pre-profiling‚Ä≤ programme in grade 9 has been introduced to help students make their choices in grade 10. = United States of America = Tech-prep programmes in the United States of America are examples of how the ‚Ä≤blending‚Ä≤ approach was used to help students make the connections between school and work. In year nine, programmes in broad occupational fields such as the health professions, automotive technology, computer systems networking are offered within general technology studies. The programmes continue for at least two years after the end of secondary school, through a tertiary education or an apprenticeship programme, with students achieving an associate degree or certificate by the end of the programme. =Iraq= It is a new experiment in Iraq about TVET, there are three ministries related to TVET in Iraq, Ministry of higher Education and scientific research which represented by the technical universities, Ministry of Education which represented by the vocational education foundation, and Ministry of Labor and Social Guaranty which represented by vocational training centers. Theses associations are trained by UNESCO for the last three years on the main topics and fields of TVET, so they now waiting the Iraqi Perelman to put the suitable law for the TVET Council in Iraq to start it system and control these associations with the required outputs of TVET.  Private sector  Private TVET providers include for- profit and non-profit institutions. Several factors triggered actions to support the expansion of private TVET including the limited capacities of public TVET providers and their low responsiveness to enterprises and trainees. Private TVET providers were expected to be more responsive because they were subject to fewer bureaucratic restrictions than public institutions (particularly in centralized systems). Their presence was expected to help raise quality system-wide, in many developing countries, government budgets constituted a vulnerable and unreliable source of financing for TVET, an important objective was to finance TVET systems by increasing the contribution of beneficiaries, including employers and trainees. Private TVET provision over since 2005 has become a significant and growing part of TVET in sub- Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa.Johanson, R. K. and Adams, A. V. 2004. Skills Development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Washington, DC, World Bank.ETF and World Bank. 2005. Reforming Technical Vocational Education and Training in the Middle East and North Africa: Experiences and Challenges. Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. In some countries, e.g. Lebanon, enrolments in private TVET institutions have exceeded enrolments in public institutions. In Jordan, private provision at the community college level has been promoted by the government. However, not all experiences has been positive with private proprietary institutions or NGOs, their courses have often been concentrated in professional areas that typically do not require large capital investment, permitting easy entry and exit by private providers from the sector. Quality issues have also emerged, where market information about quality has been unavailable. Technological advancement and its impact TVET has an important role to play in technology diffusion through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as information technology and the green economy has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning. TVET courses have been created to respond to the diverse ICT needs of learners, whether these are related to work, education or citizenship. New courses have been introduced to address occupational changes in the ICT job market, while many TVET providers have shifted provision towards a blended approach, with significantly more self-directed and/or distance learning. In developed countries, new ICT approaches have been introduced to modernize TVET organizations and to manage administration and finance, including learner records.  Education for all  The Education for All (EFA) movement has had its own implications for TVET at both international and national levels. The third EFA goal lacked precision and measurable targets for TVET, however it called for ensuring ‚Ä≤that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes‚Ä≤.World Conference on Education for All. 2000. The Dakar Framework for Action: Meeting our Collective Commitments to Education for All. Paris, UNESCO. This goal had a symbolic value, helping to raise the visibility of TVET and skills development and create a more prominent place for them on the global education policy agenda. The current bulge of young people requiring TVET learning opportunities is partly fuelled by the success of the EFA movement in opening access to basic education, particularly at the primary level. In 2009, 702 million children were enrolled worldwide in primary education, compared with 646 million in 1999.UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2006. Participation in Formal Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programmes Worldwide: An Initial Statistical Study. Bonn. UNESCO-UNEVOC.  Continuing TVET  TVET as a proportion of all upper secondary programmes Continuing TVET involves ongoing training to upgrade existing skills and to develop new ones and has a much higher profile in ageing societies and knowledge-based economies. Increased recognition of the importance of human capital for economic growth and social development made it necessary to increase learning opportunities for adults in workplaces within the wider context of policies and strategies for lifelong learning.OECD. 2005. Promoting Adult Learning, Education and Training Policy. Paris, OECD Publishing. In many countries policy-makers have considered ways to expand workplace learning opportunities for workers and to assess and give credit for knowledge and skills acquired in workplaces. Efforts were geared towards training for workers in companies, encouraged by legislation, financial incentives and contractual agreements.  Challenges  = Labour market demands and trends = Following the global financial crisis in 2008, labour markets across the world experienced structural changes that influenced the demand for skills and TVET. Unemployment worsened and the quality of jobs decreased, especially for youth. Gender differentials in labour force participation placed men ahead of women, and skill mismatches deepened. The crisis impacted labour markets adversely and led to deepening uncertainty, vulnerability of employment, and inequality.Bacchetta, M. and Jansen, M. (eds). 2011. Making Globalisation Socially Sustainable. Geneva, ILO and WTO. Furthermore, measures to improve efficiency and profitability in the economic recovery have often led to jobless growth, as happened in Algeria, India and post-apartheid South Africa. In seeking to address the level of vulnerable employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify skills needs early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems have focused more on developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt. = Migration flows = Increasing migration are significant challenges to the national character of TVET systems and qualifications. TVET qualifications are progressively expected not only to serve as proxies for an individual's competencies but to also act as a form of a currency that signals national and international value.Leney, T. 2009a. Qualifications that Count: Strengthening the Recognition of Qualifications in the Mediterranean Region. Thematic Study. Turin, Italy, ETF. http://www.etf.europa.eu/web. nsf/(RSS)/C125782B0048D6F6C125768200396FB6?OpenDocument&LAN;=EN TVET systems have been developing mechanisms to enable credible and fair cross-border recognition of skills. In 2007, the ILO identified three types of recognition that TVET system may use: unilateral (independent assessment by the receiving country), mutual (agreements between sending and receiving countries), and multilateral (mostly between a regional grouping of countries). The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.Keevy, J. 2011. The recognition of qualifications across borders: the contribution of regional qualifications frameworks. Background paper commissioned by UNESCO. Pretoria, South African Qualifications Authority. TVET systems are responding to migration by providing qualifications that can stand the rigour of these recognition systems and by creating frameworks for mutual recognition of qualifications. Regional Qualifications Frameworks such as those in Southern Africa, Europe, Asia and the Caribbean aim to significantly support the recognition of qualifications across borders.Keevy, J., Chakroun, B. and Deij, A. 2010. Transnational Qualifications Frameworks. Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union. These efforts are further supported through the introduction of outcome-based learning methodologies within the broader context of multilateral recognition agreements. =Providing broader competencies alongside specialist skills= Skills for economic development include a mix of technical and soft skills. Empirical evidence and TVET policy reviews conducted by UNESCO suggest that TVET systems may not as yet sufficiently support the development of the so-called soft competencies.UNESCO. 2013b.

Revue de politiques de formation technique et professionnelle au Benin. Paris, UNESCO. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002213/221304f.pdf Many countries have, however, adopted competency-based approaches as measures for reforming TVET curricula. The HEART Trust National Training Agency of Jamaica adopted this approach, with a particular emphasis on competency standards and balanced job-specific and generic skills. Competency standards aimed to ensure that the training was linked to industry and was up to date, and that competences were integrated into training programmes, along with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes. The balancing of skill types was to ensure adequate attention was given to job-specific skills as well as the conceptual and experiential knowledge necessary to enable individuals to grow and develop in the workplace, and more generally in society.HEART Trust NTA. 2009. Policy on competency-based education and training. Draft Concept Paper. Kingston, HEART Trust NTA. = Globalization = Globalization of the economy and the consequent reorganization of the workplace require a more adaptable labour force, requiring countries to rethink the nature and role of TVET. Globalization intensifies pressure on the TVET sector to supply the necessary skills to workers involved in globalized activity and to adapt existing skills to rapidly changing needs. As a consequence, there is an increasing requirement for more demand-driven TVET systems with a greater focus on modular and competency-based programmes, as well as on cognitive and transferable skills, which are expected to help people adapt to unpredictable conditions. = Promoting social equity and inclusive workplaces = Preparing marginalized groups of youths and adults with the right skills and helping them make the transition from school to work is part of the problem faced by TVET in promoting social equity. Ensuring that the workplace is inclusive poses numerous policy challenges, depending on the contextual dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the capabilities of individuals. For example, the experiences of exclusion by people with disabilities and disadvantaged women may be similar in some ways and different in others. Many individuals experience multiple forms of disadvantage in the workplace, to different degrees of severity, depending on social attitudes and traditions in a specific context or organization. Approaches to inclusiveness in the workplace will therefore vary according to population needs, social diversity and context. To give one example, the Netherlands set about the task of making workplaces more inclusive for low-skilled adults by offering programmes that combine language instruction with work, and in certain cases on-the-job training.OECD. 2012. Better Skills Better Jobs Better Lives ‚Äì OECD: A Strategic Approach to Skills Policies. Paris, OECD Publishing. http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/better-skills-better-jobs- better- lives_9789264177338-en A review of employer surveys in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, reported that employers valued people with disabilities for their high levels of motivation and their diverse perspectives, and found their attendance records to be the same or better than those of other employees.Employers‚Äô Forum on Disability. 2009. What does the research say are the commercial bene ts? http://www.realising-potential.org/six-building-blocks/commercial/what- researchers- say.html Many employers mentioned that being seen as pro- inclusion was positive for the company or organization's image, an advantage that goes well beyond providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups. In many cases, however, social and cultural perceptions are an obstacle to making workplaces more inclusive, and this will require sensitive and concerted attention. Some low- and middle-income countries have sought to address this through legislation. In Tanzania the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act of 1982 established a quota system that stipulates that 2 per cent of the workforce in companies with over fifty employees must be persons with disabilities.SADC and UNESCO. 2011. Final Report: Status of TVET in the SADC Region. Gaborone, SADC, p. 10. The 2012 Education for All Global Monitoring Report concluded that 'all countries, regardless of income level, need to pay greater attention to the needs of young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'.UNESCO. 2012. Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work. EFA Global Monitoring Report. Paris, UNESCO. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the skills needs of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not sufficient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor. Coherent policies that link social protection, micro-finance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups. = Gender disparities = Recent years have seen rising numbers of young women enrolling in TVET programmes, especially in service sector subjects. At times the challenge is to bring more males into female-dominated streams. However, beyond number games, the real gender parity test that TVET systems are yet to pass is balancing the gender participation in programmes that lead to employability, as well as to decent and high-paying jobs. Gender disparities in learning opportunities, and earnings, are a cause for concern. The persistent gender- typing of TVET requires concerted attention if TVET is to really serve a key facilitative role in shared growth, social equity and inclusive development. The absence of work, poor quality of work, lack of voice at work, continued gender discrimination and unacceptably high youth unemployment are all major drivers of TVET system reforms from the perspective of social equity. This is an area where TVET systems continue to be challenged to contribute proactively to the shaping of more equitable societies. Gender equality has received significant international attention in recent years, and this has been reflected in a reduction in gender participation gaps in both primary and secondary schooling. Efforts to analyse and address gender equality in TVET are relevant to other aspects of equity and dimensions of inclusion/exclusion. In almost all parts of the world, the proportion of girls to total enrolment in secondary education defined as TVET is less than for 'general' secondary education.UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2012. Global Education Digest 2012. Opportunities Lost: The Impact of Grade Repetition and Early School Leaving. Montreal, UIS.  Responses  = Bangladesh = Integrating women or men into areas of specialization in which they were previously under- represented is important to diversifying opportunities for TVET. The National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET in Bangladesh set clear priorities and targets for breaking gender stereotypes. The Strategy developed by a Gender Working Group comprising fifteen representatives from government ministries and departments, employers, workers and civil society organizations. It provided an overview of the current status and nature of gender inequalities in TVET, highlighted the priority areas for action, explored a number of steps to promote equal participation of women in TVET, and outlined the way forward.ILO. 2012b.

Savage was the only nurse to survive the sinking of the hospital ship Centaur. She was a founding member of the Australian College of Nursing, and a recipient of the George Medal and of a Florence Nightingale memorial scholarship. Name Savage signed herself as Ellen in formal letters, and most reporting is by that name, including her official war service record. However, significant reporting in otherwise reliable sources is with Eleanor. Her own family referred to her as Nelly. Early life and education Ellen Savage was born on 17 October 1912 at Quirindi, New South Wales, where she grew up as a child. She was the third daughter of Henry Savage and Sarah Ann Savage (n√©e Mulheron). Her father was born in Russia and her mother was born in New South Wales. Savage was a good swimmer, keen on surfing, at Newcastle, but did suffer from seasickness. =Education= As a child Savage attended Quirindi Convent school. Savage trained as a nurse at Newcastle Hospital from 1929 and graduated in 1934. She studied obstetrics at the Women's Hospital, Crown Street, Sydney, and mothercraft at Tresillian Mothercraft Training School, Petersham. She passed her midwifery examination in June 1936. In 1947 she won a Florence Nightingale memorial scholarship for postgraduate study in England, where she gained a diploma in nursing administration from the Royal College of Nursing. Savage was the inaugural recipient of this scholarship for New South Wales. Her overseas studies also included observational tours of hospitals in England, Scandinavia, and Canada. Savage complete her scholarship studies with distinction. The scholarship was supported by funding provided through a Red Cross appeal. Adult life Savage was an army nurse from 1941 to 1946, and then worked in other hospitals until she retired in 1967, a nursing career of 41 years. She was a Catholic, and while overseas after her scholarship studies, had a private audience with the Pope. One report, on the sinking of the Centaur states that she snatched up her rosary beads while abandoning ship, while another directly contradicts this. Savage lived in Gordon, Sydney, New South Wales. Savage was a founding member (1949), council-member (1952‚Äì59), and president (1957‚Äì58) of the Australian College of Nursing. =Public interest= There was considerable public interest in Savage's activities, and what she did, her presentation to Mrs. Roosevelt, and for example attending reunions and presenting nurse trainee awards, when she was taken ill, and the launching of ships. Reporting on her included when and where she went for holidays. Media attention to Savage's actions after the Centaur sinking was wide and varied in nature and includes presentation in cartoon comic strip format. Savage was presented to the British Royal Family in May 1948 while she was in England studying. The public's interest in Savage continued after her return from her scholarship studies in England. Reporting followed her to many places and on many activities, for example nurses outings organised by the Royal Queensland Yacht Club, as a guest speaker, meeting survivors of other war incidents, and presentation to Lady Louis Mountbatten. Savage was formally described by the Women's Weekly as one of their Interesting People in 1949. Savage was the first guest at Centaur House. A sponsor provided her a car for the five days of her visit and stay. Public interest followed Savage well after the war, for example, at ANZAC Day reunions, being individually noteworthy in 1983 ANZAC day radio programming, and being singled out in AHS Centaur commemorations in 1995. =Charity work= The public's interest in Savage was an opportunity realised by her. Savage took many opportunities to support charity work, especially war related, for example Legacy, or nursing related, and the Red Cross. Centaur House She was actively involved in fund-raising that helped to establish Centaur House, Brisbane, an educational and social centre for nurses. Of note is that Savage wrote an open letter while studying in England supporting Centaur House. Savage was the guest of honour for multiple events for this cause. She was given a special suite on her stay at Centaur House. =Advocacy= Savage was a strong advocate for nurse education, voicing her opinion that nurse education must be advanced to compete internationally, especially post graduate. And she was actively involved in fund raising for nurse education. She was also an advocate for nursing generally, espousing the capabilities of married nurses, especially nursing with chronic cases. =Later life= Savage participated in a film about the Australian War Memorial in 1977. The film, Australia Remembers, screened in 1978. Savage died on 25 April 1985 after attending an Anzac Day reunion. She collapsed outside Sydney Hospital and died that day. She never married. Career Savage undertook general training from 1929 to 1934 at Royal Newcastle Hospital. From 1934 to 1937 while private nursing she gained midwifery and Tressilian mothercraft certificates, in 1937 she had 12 months at Tressilian Home, Petersham. Savage was with the New South Wales Public Health Department from 1937 to 1941, and in 1941 she joined Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS). From 1946 to 1947 she was in charge of a health centre in North Sydney, and in 1947 took the 18 month Florence Nightingale Memorial scholarship. In 1949 became a Supervisory Sister, part of administrative staff, at Newcastle General Hospital. Savage's first professional position was at the Baby Health Centre in the regional Australian city of Tamworth, in 1938. She was a triple certificate sister: * general nursing * midwifery * mothercraft Savage joined Australian Army Nursing Service on 24 May 1941, being appointed to the 113th Australian General Hospital (AGH), Concord, Sydney. She transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 18 November 1941 and served in the Middle East in the hospital ship Oranje. She was promoted to sister on 25 May 1942 and commissioned as a lieutenant in March 1943. Savage survived the sinking of the Centaur hospital ship in May 1943. She resumed nursing at the AGH on 14 August 1943 and served there until demobilised on 8 March 1946. After her AIF discharge, Savage returned to the Public Health Department of New South Wales. Posting on discharge was the hospital ship Oranje. Savage resigned from Division of Maternal and Baby Welfare, Department of Public Health 17 February 1949. Appointed senior sister at (Royal) Newcastle Hospital, she was respected and somewhat feared for her insistence on high standards of discipline and knowledge. At Newcastle Hospital she was unexpectedly passed over for the post of director of nursing by the medical superintendent, Dr Christian McCaffrey, because she was ‚Äòentrenched in the \\"old school mode\\" wanting to maintain subservience and military discipline‚Äô. She was matron of the hospital's chest unit at Rankin Park from 3 April 1951 until ill health forced her resignation in 1967, and she continued to live in Gordon, Sydney. =AHS Centaur= Sister Ellen Savage, Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS), being interviewed at Greenslopes Army Hospital about 7 or 10 days after her rescue from the hospital ship Centaur. On 12 May 1943 Savage was one of twelve nurses who sailed in the hospital ship Centaur bound for Port Moresby to recover wounded military personnel. Two days after leaving Sydney the vessel was sunk off Moreton Island, Queensland, by a Japanese torpedo. A strong swimmer, Savage was the only nurse to survive. Savage suffered severe bruising, a fractured nose, burst ear drums, a broken palate, and fractured ribs. She joined other survivors on a makeshift raft and concealed her own injuries. She assisted the others, many of whom were severely burned. She raised their morale with group prayer and recitation of the rosary, and supervised the rationing of scant water and food supplies. Other records state she also had a broken jaw. Savage spent two hours in the water before being dragged onto a raft. They were rescued by the destroyer, , thirty-four hours later, a total of thirty-six hours after the sinking. =George Medal= For \\"conspicuous service and high courage\\" arising from the sinking of the Centaur, in 1944, she became the second Australian woman to be awarded the George Medal. The citation for her award read: Memoria On 7 April 1993 Australia issued a postage stamp in honour of Ellen Savage. Savage is also commemorated in street art, for example at the corner of Logan Road and Chatsworth Road, Greenslopes, Brisbane.

The game was originally scheduled to be released on 26 May 2017, but due to the Manchester Arena bombing, it was delayed to 23 June 2017. Premise Cole Black wakes up in an old, abandoned asylum. He is confused and his sole memory is the attempted rescue of a teenage girl with a bomb strapped to her chest. With a strange technology fused to his head ‚Äì used to read and replay human memory ‚Äì Black travels into the depths of his own mind to discover the truth about his past. Every step he takes, leads to the mysterious Red, whose intentions are difficult to guess. Gameplay Get Even is played from a first-person perspective, combining elements of shooter, puzzle, and adventure games. As Cole Black, players make their way through an abandoned insane asylum on the orders of the mysterious Red. Along the way he will interact with a number of fellow \\"inmates,\\" some of whom are friendly, some hostile. At specific points Black will enter a memory regarding a specific event that Red wishes to reconstruct, which are the game's levels. Each concludes with Black returning to the asylum and making his way further into it, until encountering the next memory. Black is equipped with a smartphone that has five apps: a scanner that can analyze specific objects for evidence; a map with which Black can navigate environments and track enemies; a thermal vision for spotting heat signatures; a phone and messaging app through which various characters communicate with Black; and an ultraviolet (UV) light for detecting trace evidence such as fingerprints and blood. Throughout each level, there are various notes, photographs, and audio recordings that can be discovered and examined, which are then stored in a special evidence room that can be accessed at specific points during or between levels. Although the gathering of these notes is not required to complete the game, collecting 100% of a level's evidence unlocks a code that can be used to open specific doors in each level. Combat is similar to that of most first-person shooters, although it is discouraged, with the explanation that killing people threatens the stability of the memory and could cause it to break down completely. The player's preference for either stealth or aggression also affects the ending they receive. Black has access to a small arsenal with which to defeat enemies, including pistols, assault rifles, and shotguns, as well as the option to perform a stealth kill at close quarters. One unique aspect of combat is a device known as the CornerGun. When it is equipped, the player can turn the gun at a 90-degree angle and look and/or fire a weapon in that direction using the smartphone. Combined with the game's emphasis on using cover, it allows the player to fire around corners or over the top of low walls and tables. It is reportedly possible, though very difficult, to complete the game without killing anyone. Puzzles consist of deciphering codes with which to open doors, or the use of valves and levers to open a particular passage. These often make use of the smartphone's apps in specific ways. Levels also contain anomalies which, when scanned with the smartphone's camera, cause the environment to alter in certain ways, usually to the player's advantage - for example, causing a van to appear in a parking garage so that an enemy's line of sight is diminished, or making a wall vent disappear, thus opening up an alternate route. At certain points in the game the player will have to make choices that can have consequences later on. For example, an early scene has Black decide whether or not to release an asylum inmate from a cell. Later, he has a choice between rerouting steam through pipes to open a passageway, or bypassing the puzzle by shooting the lock off a door. Like their approach to combat, the player's choices are commented on by Red, and influence the ending of the game. Late in the game, players take control of Red. While controlling identically to Black, Red does not use the smartphone or CornerGun. Instead, he has the power to assimilate enemies and take their weapons, which he can then use. He also makes use of warp points, which are in specific places in each level, to move quickly and avoid enemies. Instead of the map, he has a sonar vision that allows him to briefly see where enemies and warp points are from a distance. While Red does not collect evidence, he encounters engrams at specific points, which are used to reconstruct memories. Plot Cole Black finds himself outside an abandoned building with only one thing on his mind: \\"save the girl.\\" After infiltrating the building and killing the armed men he finds there, he discovers the girl tied to a chair with a bomb strapped to her chest. Black is unable to defuse the bomb before it explodes. Black suddenly wakes up in an old, abandoned asylum, with a strange device strapped to his head. He is introduced via television screens to a shadowy figure identifying itself as Red, who tells him the device is known as the Pandora, or Savant, an experimental technology designed to record and play back human memory for analytical purposes. In this case, Red wants Black to explore the circumstances surrounding the girl's kidnapping, claiming that Black had something to do with it, although he cannot remember anything. While making his way through the asylum, Black encounters several fellow inmates, whose fates are ultimately determined by his actions. Many of them refer to Black as the \\"Puppet Master\\" and make other references to Alice in Wonderland. Through the examination of several of his own memories and others provided by Red, Black begins to piece together what happened. He was hired by a man named Robert Ramsey to infiltrate ADS, a weapons contractor, and steal a prototype of their latest invention, the CornerGun. Ramsey then patented the CornerGun as his own creation, nearly bankrupting ADS and humiliating its CEO, Roger Howard. As a reward, Ramsey made Black the head of security for his own company. Black manages to recall the name Jasper Prado, an Irish mercenary who was killed in suspicious circumstances around the same time as the kidnapping. Further investigation reveals that Jasper was hired by Rose Atkins, Robert Ramsey's research assistant, with whom he had an affair. Atkins, an ambitious, amoral woman, felt she was not getting the credit she deserved for the Pandora project and decided to betray Ramsey. She hired Prado and his men to kidnap Ramsey's daughter Grace and demand the Pandora device as ransom. Black frequently stumbles upon memories that depict Ramsey as a driven man whose obsession with memory‚Äîpresumably due to his mother's succumbing to some form of mental illness‚Äîand the hope that his Pandora device will change the world causes him to neglect his wife Lenore and Grace. Based on these flashbacks and Red's angry response to them, Black deduces that Red is really Robert Ramsey, who confirms this and declares his intention to find out why Grace was taken. Black remembers himself confronting Rose about the kidnapping and then throwing her out a window, killing her. When Ramsey questions his motives, Black cannot offer a definitive answer. Black's final memory is of himself being approached by Howard, who propositions him to steal the Pandora device as revenge for the CornerGun theft, in exchange for a hefty reward and a purging of Black's criminal record (which Ramsey is apparently using as leverage). Black flatly refuses; Ramsey, however, does not believe this either, and reveals that Black is not in an asylum at all, but incapacitated in a life support chamber. The \\"world\\" dissolves around Black as he screams for mercy. The player then assumes the role of Ramsey, who is sequestered in a basement room filled with technology powering his Pandora device, through which he has been reviewing Black's recall of his memories, while Black himself is still in the life support chamber. With the help of an AI named Hope, Ramsey decides to perform an \\"audit\\" of specific memories, believing that Black was deliberately trying to hide something from him. However, these memories are distorted further by Ramsey's own fragile mental state. Distraught over the kidnapping and Lenore's leaving him because of it, Ramsey has Black, who was put in a coma by the bombing, taken from the hospital and put into his care. He discovers Black had some knowledge of the kidnapping, and that the intended target was Lenore, but Prado's impulsiveness led to Grace being taken instead. When Black discovers this, and the fact that Prado has also constructed a bomb against orders, he murders Prado himself and forces Atkins to tell him where Grace is. Unfortunately, he fails to defuse the bomb, which is haphazardly constructed and far too powerful. In the audit of Black's meeting with Howard, Black again refuses to work for Howard, but this time offers to have Howard work for him, revealing himself as the mastermind behind the kidnapping (hence the \\"Puppet Master\\" references). Depending on Black's morality during the game Ramsey either shuts off Black's life support, killing him or sends Black away to a hospital to live out the rest of his comatose life. Suddenly, the room begins to dissolve and a disembodied voice of Grace, which Black has heard throughout the game, condemns her father for causing all this to happen. Overcome with guilt, Ramsey admits that he is a terrible father and husband, who loved both his family and his mistress but could commit to neither, because he wanted his work to make a difference in the world more than anything. In a final twist, the disembodied voice is revealed to be Grace in the real world; she survived the explosion, but was left paralyzed from the waist down, and has been using the only working Pandora prototype to watch her father's memories, including his watching Black analyze his own memories. Grace can choose to shut down the Pandora link to her father, or watch one final memory: a distraught Ramsey confronts an unrepentant Howard and kills him, before attempting to commit suicide, which has left him in a vegetative state. Atkins - whose death at Black's hands was another false memory - reveals that Ramsey left his company and research to Grace, and urges her to sign a contract allowing work on the Pandora to continue. A disgusted Lenore tries to object, but Grace insists she knows what she's doing. Based on the player's approach to use of lethal force throughout the game, and certain choices made as Black (which are catalogued during Ramsey's audit), one of two endings occur. In the Good ending, Grace signs the contract, which will make her rich and still in control of the company, and fires Atkins, vowing to ensure the technology be used the way her father hoped it would be. In the Bad ending, Grace refuses to sign and destroys the Pandora prototype, ensuring the technology will never be used again.  Other Media  On November 16, 2018, Cole Black appeared in Blue Sunset Games' fighting platform game Go All Out, where he is a playable fighter, he is also the first AAA game character to be in the game. Reception Get Even received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. 8/10 was Brett Makedonski's score on Destructoid with the consensus: \\"Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.\\" Michael Goroff's 7.5/10 score on Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that \\"Get Even is better as an experience than as a game, but it‚Äôs an extremely evocative experience. Even still, what could have been a completely unique gaming experience is hampered by its desire to be a more action-oriented, generic thriller.\\" Andy Kelly's score of 66/100 on PC Gamer called the game \\"A messy, unfocused mishmash of genres with a few smart ideas.\\" Alice Bell said on VideoGamer.com that \\"Get Even's use of layered sound and even more layered story is unsettling and great, but other awkward mechanics make this psychological thriller a bit less than the sum of some very fine parts.\\" and awarded it a score of 7/10. The game was nominated for \\"Music Design\\" and \\"Best Writing\\" at the 2017 Develop Awards, and for \\"Music\\" at the 14th British Academy Games Awards.

He qualified for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA)‚Äôs National Finals Rodeo (NFR) seven times and won the world championship in 2015, after recovering from a near-fatal injury incurred after being bucked from a horse. He has won many of the elite rodeos, including the Calgary Stampede, the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, the Reno Rodeo, the Cody Stampede, and the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo. Peebles was mentored by world champion bareback rider Bobby Mote. In 2015, Peebles became a shareholder in the Elite Rodeo Athletes (ERA) tour and was then blocked from participating in future PRCA-sanctioned events, including the NFR. After the collapse of the ERA, Peebles returned to PRCA competition. Early life Steven Peebles was born in Salinas, California, on May 2, 1989 to Ken and Amy Peebles. He has a younger brother, David. Peebles grew up in Salinas where his uncle, former rodeo cowboy Bob Sailors, taught him the basics of bareback riding and roping. When Peebles was 14, his family moved to Redmond, Oregon. His uncle introduced him to Redmond resident Bobby Mote, a PRCA world champion bareback rider. In bareback riding, a competitor must ride a bucking horse, without a saddle, for 8 seconds. If he remains on the horse for the full 8 seconds, he's given a numerical score, with 100 being a perfect ride. Mote agreed to coach Peebles in return for Peebles working around Mote's ranch. Mote was impressed with Peebles riding skills. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd show him what to do and he would do it [....] He was always tough, a little hardheaded, and determined. Those are all attributes that it takes to be able to do this. He knew what he wanted to do early on and he put in the time and the work.‚Äù In high school, Peebles was a member of the junior varsity baseball team. During his sophomore year, he dislocated his shoulder during a game. Doctors insisted he sit out for a time to recover. Instead, Peebles entered a local rodeo and won $700. He decided that he would focus on rodeo with the goal of one day winning his own world title. Career =PRCA= After graduating high school in 2008, Peebles joined the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). Cowboys are ranked by the amount of money they win at PRCA-sanctioned rodeos. The top 15 in each event are invited to the annual National Finals Rodeo (NFR). Peebles qualified for the NFR for the first time in 2009. He finished 12th in the world and was named the PRCA Bareback Riding Rookie of the Year. By Labor Day in 2010, Peebles had earned his way to a number 11 ranking in the PRCA standing. He was also ranked 18ths in the ProRodeo Tour standings. The ProRodeo Tour is a set of 22 rodeos with its own finales. At the final ProRodeo Tour stop, in Ellensburg, WA, Peebles set the arena record for bareback riding, earning a 90 on Mad Money. He won almost $9,000 over the course of the Ellensburg rodeo, more than any of his competitors. At his second NFR, Pebles finished 13th. During the 2011 NFR, Peebles placed in three of the first four rounds. In the next round, he broke his right leg and tore ligaments in his right ankle, forcing him to withdraw from the competition. Peebles finished the 2012 NFR ranked 10th in the world. For much of the first half of 2013, Peebles was recovering from hip surgery, leaving him unable to ride. He spent his enforced break studying footage of championship rides. He returned to competition in mid-June At the 2013 NFR, Peebles won rounds two and three. He narrowly missed winning the world title, finishing second to Kaycee Feild in both the aggregate and the world championship. Peebles' brother, David, joined the PRCA as a bareback rider in 2014. The brothers spent part of the season traveling together. In February 2014, Peebles won the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo in San Antonio, Texas. He went on to place first at the Wrangler Champions Challenge Rodeo in Rapid City, South Dakota, the Clark County Fair and Rodeo in Logandale, Nevada, the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo, and the Central Point Wild Rouge Pro Rodeo in Oregon. Two days before he competed at the Cody Stampede in Cody, Wyoming, Peebles was kicked by a horse, leaving him with a \\"left eye nearly swollen shut.\\" A few days later he won a round of the Calgary Stampede with an 87.5 point ride on Ragged Ann. He finished second overall at the Stampede, for the third time. He went on to win the RAM Columbia River Circuit Finals. At that event, his intermittent back pain returned. Peebles attributed it to his \\"right hip get[ting] out of line and pinch[ing] some nerves.\\" Peebles entered the 2014 NFR second in the rankings, behind defending world champion Feild. For the second year in a row, Peebles won the second round of the NFR, this time with an 85-point ride on Right Spur. The win brought him to within $45,500 of Feild's total, giving him an outside shot to win the title. In the third round of the event, Peebles was injured when the horse bucked in the chute. This caused a compression fracture in his back, forcing him to withdraw from the competition and ending his hopes of displacing Feild. Although one doctor told Peebles he'd be lucky to walk again, Peebles recovered The 2015 season began well. On June 26, Peebles won the Reno Rodeo for the first time, with an 83-point ride on Peppy Bound. By the end of June, Peebles was ranked 9th in the bareback riding standings. On July 2, 2015, he competed at a rodeo in Livingston, Montana. He won with an 86-point ride, but just after the buzzer he lost his hold and was bucked from the horse, landing flat on his back in the dirt. The fall broke several ribs, one of which sliced an artery. Blood began pooling in his chest cavity, slowly causing his lungs to collapse. Peebles was able to walk away unassisted, although in a great deal of pain. After the rodeo ended, Peebles' traveling partner, fellow bareback rider Brian Bain, insisted that Peebles go to the hospital. The two argued; Peebles was convinced his broken ribs could wait until they arrived in Billings, Montana, away. He did not want his friend would miss his flight and be unable to compete in a rodeo the following day. Bain drove directly to the hospital, saving Peebles' life. Doctors in Livingston diagnosed the nicked artery and promptly put Peebles in an ambulance to Bozeman, Montana, which had a larger hospital with more specialized doctors. They were unsure that Peebles would survive the ambulance ride. A doctor in Bozeman was able to repair the injury, later telling Peebles it was a miracle that he had survived. Peebles spent nine of the next 14 days in the hospital. Doctors urged Peebles to allow three months to heal before getting on another bucking horse. Six weeks after the injury, however, Peebles had slipped to number 22 in the rankings, which put his chances of qualifying for the December NFR in jeopardy. Over the protests of his family, Peebles returned to competition. He placed second in his first rodeo post-injury, scoring 85 points at the Omak Stampede Rodeo. He rode in 5 rodeos per week to try to earn enough money to regain his place in the standings. Peebles said that during this time, ‚ÄúI was weak and I could barely breathe[....] There were a few rides where I was about to faint, and I‚Äôd have guys helping me get all my stuff off when I got off. But I just kept fighting through it, because I wanted to make national finals.‚Äù By September, Peebles was once again ranked in the top 15. At the 2015 NFR, his seventh time to compete for the title, Peebles won or tied for first in three of the first four rounds, moving him from 14th in the standings to 2nd, behind Feild. At the end of nine rounds, Peebles held the lead in the average standings but trailed Feild in earnings. The winner was decided in the tenth and final round. Peebles tied for first in that round, earning an 83.5 on Good Time Charlie. Feild earned only 77 points, finishing out of the money. This was enough for Peebles to win both the world championship and the aggregate, breaking Feild's string of consecutive championships. Peebles earned a total of $234,054 at the NFR, the most of any contestant. Peebles broke his back for the second time when he was a passenger in a car that flipped, in February 2016. This time he suffered an injury to the 10th thoracic vertebrae and also injured his shoulder. He spent six months recovering. According to Peebles, \\"It was the longest break I've ever had and I was going crazy at home.\\" He returned to competition at the Calgary Stampede. There, he qualified for the finals by earning a score of 90 on Wild and Blue. In the finals, his score of 87.5 (on Shadow Warrior) tied for first with Caleb Benett. To determine the winner, both were forced to reride. Peebles won the $100,000 purse with an 83-point ride on Wildwood Flower. =ERA= In 2015, a group of elite rodeo cowboys formed the Elite Rodeo Athletes (ERA), a professional rodeo tour with its own world championship. Peebles, along with his mentor Mote and almost 80 other athletes, became a shareholder in the new association. The ERA was designed to offer a limited number of rodeos with higher payouts than PRCA rodeos usually offered. The PRCA quickly enacted a new bylaw prohibiting ERA shareholders from participating in PRCA-sanctioned rodeos, including the NFR, beginning in 2016. The ERA's inaugural season, in 2016, consisted of 5 rodeos. Three other scheduled events were cancelled due to poor sales. Peebles qualified for its first and only championship event.

He played college football for the UCLA Bruins from 2012 to 2016. He was also a sprinter on the UCLA track and field team. Early years Walker was born outside of the San Francisco Bay Area in Brookside, California, to Patricia Jones and Kenneth Walker II. He grew in the East Bay in the dangerous Iron Triangle neighborhood of Richmond. His parents separated when he was in the seventh grade, and his mom raised Walker and his two older brothers as a single parent. In an attempt to keep her youngest out of trouble, she sent him to live in Oakley with his father, who had remarried. There, Walker excelled in both track and football at Freedom High School.

Plot In the 22nd century, Ern A. Smithe is a \\"reclone\\" of a mystery writer, embedded with the recorded memories of his original and stored in a library where patrons can consult or borrow him. He is checked out by a woman who hopes that he can help solve the mysterious deaths of her father and brother, because her father's safe had contained nothing except one of Smithe's novels.

Reception At Strange Horizons, John Clute stated that it was \\"almost (...) the saddest story I have ever heard\\", and \\"not (...) quite the most adamantly terminal novel Gene Wolfe has ever written\\", noting that its many apparent stylistic flaws are deliberate (for instance, Smithe's narration is in the style of a hardboiled mystery because, as a reclone, his speech production has been artificially constrained); Clute also observed that the name \\"Ern A.

Life and person  Born in South Africa in Colenzo-Ladysmith in the then province of Natal, Jacques le Roux discovered his passion for music at an early age. His mother, an organist in the local church, took his early music education upon herself and gave him his first music lessons. Pursuing a better life, the family relocated to Vereeniging, a city in Tranvaal now known as Gauteng, where Jacques le Roux at the age of 14 started studying piano and clarinet at the local gymnasium conservatory. It was during these years that he discovered his singing talent. This finally lead him to further his music studies at the Conservatorium of the North-West University in Potchefstroom, where he studied voice under Prof. Werner Nel. In 2006 the singer went abroad to the Netherlands and Germany in pursuing an international opera career. He now resides in Austria.  Career  As a student in his native South Africa, Jacques le Roux already sung many student opera productions and won popularity for his charismatic acting talent, the beauty of his voice and his authenticity on stage.

He was also nominated as a finalist in the Belvedere singing competition in Vienna, Austria. In 2006 le Roux was part of the Resident Artist Program of the Nationale Reisopera in Enschede, the Netherlands, where he sang the role of Pedrillo in The Abduction from the Seraglio, an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The following year 2007 marked his European stage debut. His success in the role of Don Ramiro in G.

It was constructed between 1939 and 1957 for the purpose of having a place to go to for a simple life away from a cosmopolitan lifestyle. It was finally removed in the 1970s to make way for a state park.  Description  Dune Forest Village was an \\"island\\" retreat not surrounded by water, but by the sand dunes of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in the United States. It consisted of a set of several small custom-made summer cabins and buildings at a homesteaded property in Michigan. The village consisted not only of summer resident dwellings, but also had a schoolhouse, church, general store, restaurant, and printing office. The little red schoolhouse had desks and books ready for class lessons; the church had an organ for music for the churchgoer worshipers, and the general store had 25 post office boxes. There was also a small restaurant boutique and a print shop office. The buildings were small but functional and used from time to time. One Sunday there were 32 people from Grand Rapids, Michigan that attended church services in the village chapel.  Background  Lathers had homesteaded a tract of land of some on the shores of Lake Michigan in Western Michigan near Hart. Here he developed a small village as a retreat for himself and guests. The group of buildings constructed by Lathers was called Dunes Forest Village because there were trees in the area. The boards and construction material for his village were transported by Lathers by hand, as these was no public access to the remote area. He dragged the lumber and material for construction across the dunes. Lathers, considered a romanticist, envisioned his own island where he could go to for peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the real world. He made his \\"island\\" in the sand dunes on the shores of Lake Michigan at the village of Mears near Hart. Lathers started construction of his small buildings in 1939. Lathers had a vision of a simple lifestyle and continued to work on building the village until 1957.  Works related to the village  * Gardener of the Dunes (1929)‚ÄîLathers wrote of a simple lifestyle that he ultimately developed in the dunes of the ideal village for peace of mind. * Village in the Dunes (1942)‚ÄîLathers wrote on his family's life at the dunes village.  Demise  The village buildings of Dune Forest deteriorated over a twenty-year period of time and were vandalized.

This hypothesis argues that areas of the brain involved in movement and sensation, as well as movement itself, influence cognitive processes such as language comprehension. In addition, the reverse effect is argued, where it is proposed that language comprehension influences movement and sensation. Proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action conduct and interpret linguistic, cognitive, and movement studies within the framework of embodied cognition and embodied language processing. Embodied language developed from embodied cognition, and proposes that sensorimotor systems are not only involved in the comprehension of language, but that they are necessary for understanding the semantic meaning of words. TOC  Development of the bi-directional hypothesis  See also: Embodied language processingDepiction of the current theories on the degree of overlap between cognitive (C) and action-perception (A) processes. Action- oriented models of cognition propose that cognitive processes stem from action (bottom, red), thereby necessitating sensorimotor systems for higher cognitive processes like language comprehension. Adapted from Kilner et al. (2016). The theory that sensory and motor processes are coupled to cognitive processes stems from action-oriented models of cognition. These theories, such as the embodied and situated cognitive theories, propose that cognitive processes are rooted in areas of the brain involved in movement planning and execution, as well as areas responsible for processing sensory input, termed sensorimotor areas or areas of action and perception. According to action-oriented models, higher cognitive processes evolved from sensorimotor brain regions, thereby necessitating sensorimotor areas for cognition and language comprehension. With this organization, it was then hypothesized that action and cognitive processes exert influence on one another in a bi-directional manner: action and perception influence language comprehension, and language comprehension influences sensorimotor processes. Although studied in a unidirectional manner for many years, the bi-directional hypothesis was first described and tested in detail by Aravena et al. These authors utilized the Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE), a task commonly used to study the relationship between action and language, to test the effects of performing simultaneous language comprehension and motor tasks on neural and behavioral signatures of movement and language comprehension. These authors proposed that these two tasks cooperate bi-directionally when compatible, and interfere bi- directionally when incompatible. For example, when the movement implied by the action language stimuli is compatible with the movement being performed by the subject, it was hypothesized that performance of both tasks would be enhanced. Neural evidence of the bi-directional hypothesis was demonstrated by this study, and the development of this hypothesis is ongoing.  Effects of Language Comprehension on Systems of Action  Language comprehension tasks can exert influence over systems of action, both at the neural and behavioral level. This means that language stimuli influence both electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain, as well as actual movement. = Neural activation = Language stimuli influence electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain that are specific to the bodily association of the words presented. This is referred to as semantic somatotopy, which indicates activation of sensorimotor areas that are specific to the bodily association implied by the word. For example, when processing the meaning of the word ‚Äúkick,‚Äù the regions in the motor and somatosensory cortices that represent the legs will become more active. Boulenger et al. demonstrated this effect by presenting subjects with action-related language while measuring neural activity using fMRI. Subjects were presented with action sentences that were either associated with the legs (e.g. ‚ÄúJohn kicked the object‚Äù) or with the arms (e.g. ‚ÄúJane grasped the object‚Äù). The medial region of the motor cortex, known to represent the legs, was more active when subjects were processing leg-related sentences, whereas the lateral region of the motor cortex, known to represent the arms, was more active with arm-related sentences. This body- part-specific increase in activation was exhibited about 3 seconds after presentation of the word, a time window that is thought to indicate semantic processing.Humphries, C., Binder, J.R., Medler, D.A., Liebenthal, E. (2007). \\"Time-course of semantic processes during sentence comprehension: an fMRI study.\\" Neuroimage. 36: 924-932. In other words, this activation was associated with subjects comprehending the meaning of the word. This effect held true, and was even intensified, when subjects were presented with idiomatic sentences. Abstract language that implied more figurative actions were used, either associated with the legs (e.g. ‚ÄúJohn kicked the habit‚Äù) or the arms (e.g. ‚ÄúJane grasped the idea‚Äù). Increased neural activation of leg motor regions were demonstrated with leg-related idiomatic sentences, whereas arm-related idiomatic sentences were associated with increased activation of arm motor regions. This activation was larger than that demonstrated by more literal sentences (e.g. ‚ÄúJohn kicked the object‚Äù), and was also present in the time window associated with semantic processing. Action language not only activates body-part-specific areas of the motor cortex, but also influences neural activity associated with movement. This has been demonstrated during an Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE) task, a common test used to study the relationship between language comprehension and motor behavior. This task requires the subject to perform movements to indicate understanding of a sentence, such as moving to press a button or pressing a button with a specific hand posture, that are either compatible or incompatible with movement implied by the sentence. For example, pressing a button with an open hand to indicate understanding of the sentence \\"Jane high-fived Jack\\" would be considered a compatible movement, as the sentence implies an open-handed posture. Motor potentials (MP) are an Event Related Potentials (ERPs) stemming from the motor cortex, and are associated with execution of movement. Enhanced amplitudes of MPs have been associated with precision and quickness of movements. Re-afferent potentials (RAPs) are another form of ERP, and are used as a marker of sensory feedback and attention. Both MP and RAP have been demonstrated to be enhanced during compatible ACE conditions. These results indicate that language can have a facilitory effect on the excitability of neural sensorimotor systems. This has been referred to as semantic priming, indicating that language primes neural sensorimotor systems, altering excitability and movement. = Movement = The ability of language to influence neural activity of motor systems also manifests itself behaviorally by altering movement. Semantic priming has been implicated in these behavioral changes, and has been used as evidence for the involvement of the motor system in language comprehension. The Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE) is indicative of these semantic priming effects. Understanding language that implies action may invoke motor facilitation, or prime the motor system, when the action or posture being performed to indicate language comprehension is compatible with action or posture implied by the language. Compatible ACE tasks have been shown to lead to shorter reaction times. This effect has been demonstrated on various types of movements, including hand posture during button pressing, reaching, and manual rotation. Language stimuli can also prime the motor system simply by describing objects that are commonly manipulated. In a study performed by Masson et al., subjects were presented with sentences that implied non-physical, abstract action with an object (e.g. \\"John thought about the calculator\\" or \\"Jane remembered the thumbtack\\"). After presentation of language stimuli, subjects were cued to perform either functional gestures, gestures typically made when using the object described in the sentence (e.g. poking for calculator sentences), or a volumetric gesture, gestures that are more indicative of whole hand posture (e.g. horizontal grasp for calculator sentences). Target gestures were either compatible or incompatible with the described object, and were cued at two different time points, early and late. Response latencies for performing compatible functional gestures significantly decreased at both time points, whereas latencies were significantly lower for compatible volumetric gestures in the late cue condition. These results indicate that descriptions of abstract interactions with objects automatically (early time point) generate motor representations of functional gestures, priming the motor system and increasing response speed. The specificity of enhanced motor responses to the gesture-object interaction also highlights the importance of the motor system in semantic processing, as this enhanced motor response was dependent on the meaning of the word. Change in relative phase shift (RPS), indicating movement coordination, as a function of language stimuli. Subjects exhibited a significant change in RPS only when presented with performable sentences. Adapted from Olmstead et al. (2009). A study performed by Dr. Olmstead et al., described in detail elsewhere, demonstrates more concretely the influence that the semantics of action language can have on movement coordination. Briefly, this study investigated the effects of action language on the coordination of rhythmic bimanual hand movements. Subjects were instructed to move two pendulums, one with each hand, either in-phase (pendulums are at the same point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 0 degrees) or anti-phase (pendulums are at the opposite point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 180 degrees). Robust behavioral studies have revealed that these two phase states, with phase differences 180 and 0 degrees, are the two stable relative phase states, or the two coordination patterns that produce stable movement. This pendulum swinging task was performed as subjects judged sentences for their plausibility; subjects were asked to indicate whether or not each presented sentence made logical sense. Plausible sentences described actions that could be performed by a human using the arms, hands, and/or fingers (\\"He is swinging the bat\\"), or actions that could not be performed (\\"The barn is housing the goat\\"). Implausible sentences also used similar action verbs (\\"He is swinging the hope\\"). Plausible, performable sentences lead to a significant change in the relative phase shift of the bimanual pendulum task. The coordination of the movement was altered by action language stimuli, as the relative phase shift that produced stable movement was significantly different than in the non-performable sentence and no language stimuli conditions. This development of new stable states has been used to imply a reorganization of the motor system utilized to plan and execute this movement, and supports the bi-directional hypothesis by demonstrating an effect of action language on movement.  Effects of Systems of Action on Language Comprehension  The bi-directional hypothesis of action and language proposes that altering the activity of motor systems, either through altered neural activity or actual movement, influences language comprehension. Neural activity in specific areas of the brain can be altered using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or by studying patients with neuropathologies leading to specific sensory and/or motor deficits. Movement is also used to alter the activity of neural motor systems, increasing overall excitability of motor and pre-motor areas. = Neural activation = Altered neural activity of motor systems has been demonstrated to influence language comprehension. One such study that demonstrates this effect was performed by Dr. Pulverm√ºller et al. TMS was used to increase the excitability of either the leg region or the arm region of the motor cortex. Authors stimulated the left motor cortex, known to be more closely involved in language processing in right-handed individuals, the right motor cortex, as well as a sham stimulation where stimulation was prevented by a plastic block placed between the coil and the skull. During the stimulation protocols, subjects were shown 50 arm, 50 leg, 50 distractor (no bodily relation), and 100 pseudo- (not real) words. Subjects were asked to indicate recognition of a meaningful word by moving their lips, and response times were measured. It was found that stimulation of the left leg region of the motor cortex significantly reduced response times for recognition of leg words as compared to arm words, whereas the reverse was true for stimulation of the arm region. Stimulation site on the right motor cortex, as well as sham stimulation, did not exhibit these effects. Therefore, somatotopically-specific stimulation of the left motor cortex facilitated word comprehension in a body-part-specific manner, where stimulation of the leg and arm regions lead to enhanced comprehension of leg and arm words, respectively. This study has been used as evidence for the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action, as it showcases that manipulating motor cortex activity alters language comprehension in a semantically-specific manner. A similar experiment has been performed on the articulatory motor cortex, or the mouth and lip regions of the motor cortex used in the production of words. Two categories of words were used as language stimuli: words that involved the lips for production (e.g. \\"pool\\") or the tongue (e.g. \\"tool). Subjects listened to the words, were shown pairs of pictures, and were asked to indicate which picture matched the word they heard with a button press. TMS was used prior to presentation of the language stimuli to selectively facilitate either the lip or tongue regions of the left motor cortex; these two TMS conditions were compared to a control condition where TMS was not applied. It was found that stimulation of the lip region of the motor cortex lead to a significantly decreased response time for lip words as compared to tongue words. In addition, during recognition of tongue words, reduced reaction times were seen with tongue TMS as compared to lip TMS and no TMS. Although this same effect was not seen with lip words, authors attribute this to the complexity of tongue as opposed to lip movements, and the increase difficulty of tongue words as opposed to lip. Overall, this study demonstrates that the activity in the articulatory motor cortex influences the comprehension of single spoken words, and highlights the importance of the motor cortex in speech comprehension Lesions of sensory and motor areas have also been studied to elucidate the effects of sensorimotor systems on language comprehension. One such example of this is the patient JR; this patient has a lesion in areas in the auditory association cortex implicated in processing auditory information. This patient showcases significant impairments in conceptual and perceptual processing of sound-related language and objects. For example, processing the meaning of words describing sound-related objects (e.g., \\"bell') was significantly impaired in JR as compared to non-sound- related objects (e.g., \\"armchair\\"). These data suggest that damage of sensory regions involved in processing auditory information specifically impair processing of sound-related conceptual information, highlighting the necessity of sensory systems for language comprehension. = Movement = Movement has been shown to influence language comprehension. This has been demonstrated by priming motor areas with movement, increasing the excitability of motor and pre-motor areas associated with the body part being moved. It has been demonstrated that motor engagement of a specific body part decreases neural activity in language processing areas when processing words related to that body part. This decreased neural activity is a feature of semantic priming, and suggests that activation of specific motor areas through movement can facilitate language comprehension in a semantically-dependent manner. An interference effect has also been demonstrated. During incompatible ACE conditions, neural signatures of language comprehension have been shown to be inhibited. Combined, these pieces of evidence have been used to support a semantic role of the motor system. Movement can also inhibit language comprehension tasks, particularly tasks of verbal working memory. When asked to memorize and verbally recall four-word sequences of either arm or leg action words, performing complex, rhythmic movements after presentation of the word sequences was demonstrated to interfere with memory performance. This performance deficit was body-part specific, where movement of the legs impaired performance of recall of leg words, and movement of the arms impaired recall of arm words. These data indicate that sensorimotor systems exhibit cortically specific \\"inhibitory casual effects\\" on memory of action words, as impairment was specific to motor engagement and bodily association of the words.  Organization of Neural Substrates  Relating cognitive functions to brain structures is done in the field of cognitive neuroscience. This field attempts to map cognitive processes, such as language comprehension, onto neural activation of specific brain structures.The bi-directional hypothesis of language and action requires that action and language processes have overlapping brain structures, or shared neural substrates, thereby necessitating motor areas for language comprehension. The neural substrates of embodied cognition are often studied using the cognitive tasks of object recognition, action recognition, working memory tasks, and language comprehension tasks. These networks have been elucidated with behavioral, computational, and imaging studies, but the discovery of their exact organization is ongoing. = Circuit organization = Proposed organization of motor-semantic neural circuits for action language comprehension. Gray dots represent areas of language comprehension, creating a network for comprehending all language. The semantic circuit of the motor system, particularly the motor representation of the legs (yellow dots), is incorporated when leg-related words are comprehended. Adapted from Shebani et al. (2013). It has been proposed that the control of movement is organized hierarchically, where movement is not controlled by individually controlling single neurons, but that movements are represented at a gross, more functional level. A similar concept has been applied to the control of cognition, resulting in the theory of cognitive circuits. This theory proposes that there are functional units of neurons in the brain that are strongly connected, and act coherently as a functional unit during cognitive tasks. These functional units of neurons, or \\"thought circuits,\\" have been referred to as the \\"building blocks of cognition\\". Thought circuits are believed to have been originally formed from basic anatomical connections, that were strengthened with correlated activity through Hebbian learning and plasticity. Formation of these neural networks has been demonstrated with computational models using known anatomical connections and Hebbian learning principles.Pulverm√ºller, F., & Garagnani, M. (2014). From sensorimotor learning to memory cells in prefrontal and temporal association cortex: a neurocomputational study of disembodiment. Cortex, 57: 1-21. For example, sensory stimulation through interaction with an object activates a distributed network of neurons in the cortex. Repeated activation of these neurons, through Hebbian plasticity, may strengthen their connections and form a circuit.Doursat, R., & Bienenstock, E. \\"Neocortical self-structuration as a basis for learning.\\" 5th International conference on development and learning (ICDL 2006). 2006. This sensory circuit may then be activated during the perception of known objects. This same concept has been applied to action and language, as understanding of the meaning of action words requires an understanding of the action itself. During language and motor skill development, one likely learns to associate an action word with an action or a sensation. This action or sensation, and the correlated sensorimotor areas involved, are then incorporated into the neural representation of that concept. This leads to semantic topography, or the activation of motor areas related to the meaning and bodily association of action language. These networks may be organized into \\"kernels,\\" areas highly activated by language comprehension tasks, and \\"halos,\\" brain areas in the periphery of networks that experience slightly increased activation. It has been hypothesized that language comprehension is housed in the left- perisylvian neuronal circuit, forming the \\"kernel,\\" and sensorimotor regions are peripherally activated during semantic processing of action language, forming the \\"halo\\". = Evidence for shared neural networks = Many studies that have demonstrated a role of the motor system in semantic processing of action language have been used as evidence for a shared neural network between action and language comprehension processes. For example, facilitated activity in language comprehension areas, evidence of semantic priming, with movement of a body part that is associated with the action word has also been used as evidence for this shared neural network. A more specific method for identifying whether certain areas of the brain are necessary for a cognitive task is to demonstrate impaired performance of said task following a functional change to the brain area of interest.Shallice, T. From neuropsychology to mental structure. Cambridge University Press, 1988. A functional change may involve a lesion, or altered excitability through stimulation, or utilization of the area for another task. According to this theory, there is only a finite amount of neural real-estate available for each task. If two tasks share a neural network, there will be competition for the associated neural substrates, and the performance of each task will be inhibited when performed simultaneously. Using this theory, proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis have postulated that performance of verbal working memory of action words would be impaired by movement of the concordant body part. This has been demonstrated with the selective impairment of memorization of arm and leg words when coupled with arm and leg movements, respectively. This implies that the neural network for verbal working memory is specifically tied to the motor systems associated with the body part implied with the word. This semantic topography has been suggested to provide evidence that action language shares a neural network with sensorimotor systems, thereby supporting the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action.

He was known for his versatile work, offering jackets that worked with both full and narrow skirts, and two-piece dresses that worked equally well as interchangeable blouses and skirts. In the 1960s, he updated his work to successfully meet the demands of the next generation for even more practical, pared-down clothing. When curating his major exhibition of American sportswear for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998, Richard Martin noted that many of Wragge's former customers still retained the capsule wardrobes they had originally bought in the 1940s and 1950s.

Secretly in love with Princess Aikham King Suttho: Ruler of Naga History Retold over generations with slight variations occurring with each retelling. The story remained largely true to the original. The story mentions King Ek- Thita and his beautiful teenage daughter Aikham, who is the subject of interest and desire of the princes of other cities for her beauty. Synopsis Prince Phalanges of Pat Pong City, in particular, gets news of Aikham's exquisite beauty and in anticipation of winning her hand decides to send her gifts of gold, diamonds and silks. On receiving the gifts the Chamberlain tells Princess Nang Ai about her admiring Prince and how strong and handsome he was. After hearing the story the princess gets interested in the prince and sends a tribute back. Before the chamberlain returns from her journey, Nang Ai sends a message to the Prince inviting him and his army to come into her city and meet her. When Phadaeng meets Nang Ai they fall in love and marry. Pungkee, the son of Sudtonark and prince of the underwater city, desperately wanted to see the beautiful Nang Ai. Pungkee in his past life was poor and mute. He traveled begging for money from village to village until one day he reached a rich man's house. He begged to live in this house in exchange for his labors doing housework. The rich owner liked him so much that he betrothed to him his daughter (Nang Ai in a past life). Pungkee in his previous existence was not the same as other men. He did not love his wife, but she never rebuked him and always took care of him as a good wife. After a while, Pungkee, missing his home, takes his wife home with him. A millionaire whose wife's father prepares food for the journey, carried by a daughter, but...] (meaning unclear) Pungkee never helps her carry it. It was a difficult journey because they had to cross mountains, forests and canals. Soon the food that she was carrying became weightless because they kept falling along the way. Pungkee seeing mature figs and harvests them for lunch. Nang Ai waited for her husband at the bottom of the fig tree but he sees Pungkee, forgetting his wife and walking away. She decides to collect figs by herself. After she was full she goes back down to the land but she doesn't see her husband. It rankled her and made her suffer all the way until she reached a river. She takes a bath and prays asking for her husband to die at the branch, and for them to never become husband and wife again in their next life. In their next life, they are reborn as princess Nang Ai and prince Pungkee. When the princess Nang Ai became a teenager she became the most graceful and beautiful girl in the city. The king Khom sends a message to other cities for the Boon Bung Fai competition to be held at Aekchateeta city. The purpose of this competition was to offer a sacrifice to king Tan in the sky begging for rain. It was also a competition to find out the greatest Boon Bung Fai, who would have Nang Ai as his wife. King Khom decides that the 15th day of the 6th waxing moon was to be the Boon Bung Fai day. Every other city sent Boon Bung Fai to compete in this festival. It was the biggest Boonbungfai festival ever held. Prince Padang did not get the invitation, but still came to compete and King Khom welcomed him. Pungkee, prince of the underwater city also heard about this festival and wanted to visit the human city to see princess Nang Ai but his father was opposed to him going. Prince Pungkee secretly impersonated the albino squirrel in Esan called ‚ÄúKarokdaon‚Äù and his followers also impersonated animals and went on a journey to see the beautiful princess. The Boonbungfai festival was fun and everybody wanted to know who would win the festival and win the princess for their wife. Many participated in the drum contest in Esan called ‚ÄúSeng Klong‚Äù. The result of this competition was the Boonbungfai of the king Thom. The Boonbungfai of the prince Phadaeng wasn't pleasing to the sky king, but the Boonbungfai of SaengHaen, the king SaengHaen city was the most pleasing to the sky king Tan and he won the competition. King Saeng Haen was the uncle of princess Nang Ai so the contest was invalidated. Prince Pungkee and Prince Phadaeng went back home after the festival but prince Pungkee couldn‚Äôt resist life in the city because he wanted to see princess Nang Ai again. He impersonated the albino squirrel, wearing a gold bell. He held out a branch near Nang Ai‚Äôs room and she heard the bell jingle, so she opened the window and saw the albino squirrel. She wanted the albino squirrel so she ordered her hunter to catch it for her, no matter if it was alive or dead. The hunter stalked it by following it through multiple villages, but couldn't catch it. Finally, retribution found Pungkee; he stopped to eat a mature fig as he was hungry and suddenly, the hunter shot him with a toxic dart. Pungkee knew that he would die so he commanded his followers to tell his father and before he died wished for his body to be eaten by everybody in the city. When Pungkee died, the hunter brought his body, which was now squirrel meat, to distribute to every village except Dokkaew village. When Pungkee‚Äôs followers came back to tell Naga, who was the father of Pungkee, he got very angry, so he ordered death for everybody that ate his son‚Äôs meat. Only Dokkaew survived Meanwhile, people panicked and fled the city. Prince Phadaeng rode a horse named ‚ÄúBuksam‚Äù to find the princess. When he arrived in the city he saw Nagas everywhere. He found out that Nang Ai was cooking squirrel meat, not caring what was happening in her city. Nang Ai gave some squirrel soup to Phadaeng. Phadaeng asks her where the meat was from and Nang Ai answers that it came from the hunter. Phadaeng knew that this was meat from Pungkee, and he stopped eating it. That night, he heard noises he knew were from Naga, so he brought Nang Ai, a horse to ride and get away. Nang Ai had eaten the squirrel meat, so was to be killed. Phadaeng and Nang Ai tried to get away, but Naga followed them until Nang Ai fell from the horse and drowned. Phadaeng saw her die. He faints and dies because he misses her. After Phadaeng dies, he turns into a ghost and comes to revenge the Naga army. He gathers ghost soldiers to battle them. The large battle destroys every city and village and creates the big swamp that became Monaghan. It only ends when the Seraph stops the war and tells both sides to forgive each other.

Academic Skills  When assessing children's readiness for kindergarten, much of the discussion is focused on the emergence of basic academic skills, including reading, writing, and arithmetic, which are commonly referred to as the ‚Äúthree Rs‚Äù (United States Department of Education, 2001). This is likely because upon entering kindergarten, academic skills‚Äîsuch as literacy and numeracy‚Äîpredict later academic success. = Reading = Reading is an important skill as reading ability during primary school predicts academic achievement and later success. Therefore, particular emphasis is usually placed upon the development of literacy skills for preschool and kindergarten students to prepare them for the future. Children are not expected to read upon entering kindergarten. However, they are expected to have phonemic and phonological awareness, as well as a knowledge of print.Tankersley, K. (2003). Threads of reading: Strategies for literacy development. Alexandria, Va: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Phonemic awareness is the first step in learning to read; it refers to the ability to hear and manipulate the smallest forms of language known as phonemes. Phonemic awareness upon entering kindergarten is the strongest predictor of reading success. Once a child understands phonemes, the next step is to develop phonological awareness, which is the ability to recognize that there is a relationship between sounds and letters, and letters and words. Phonological awareness strongly predicts the development of literacy skills. Upon entering kindergarten, children should also be able to recognize their own name in print, know how to handle a book, recognize letters, and identify words that rhyme. These are all predictors of literacy success. Another important aspect of reading development is the understanding of narrative structures, which lends to better comprehension skills.Pinkham, A. M., Kaefer, T., & Neuman, S. B. (2012). Knowledge development in early childhood: Sources of learning and classroom implications. New York: The Guilford Press. Vocabulary development is closely associated with comprehension skills; those with weaker vocabularies may have difficulties following narratives. = Writing = Upon entering Kindergarten, children typically make attempts to write their own name and letters that have been dictated, and are able to master some of the letters (NCLD, Pianta). In order to write letters, children must be able to integrate auditory information (what sound the letter makes) and orthographic skills (knowledge of letters and print convention). Children's developing ability to write letters is related to later literacy outcomes such as reading compression and spelling (Pianta). However, during the transition into Kindergarten the primary focus in terms of relevant writing skills involves the physical ability to draw (i.e., motor skills). Kindergarten aged students can typically draw pictures of themselves and their families and use a variety of different sized lines and shapes in their drawings (NCLD). = Arithmetic = In general, children are expected to have knowledge of numbers to demonstrate kindergarten readiness. Children generally should be able to count to at least 10, count about 5 objects, demonstrate knowledge of adding or taking away objects, and identify basic shapes, such as triangles, circles, and squares (NCLD, 2006). Recent studies in Australia have suggested that children know much more mathematics than kindergarten teachers would expect upon beginning kindergarten. In general, children should demonstrate problem- solving, spatial reasoning, and calculation abilities. Children engage in nonverbal calculation at early ages; however the transition from nonverbal to verbal calculation does not take place until approximately five and half years of age (Mix, Huttenlocher, & Levine, 2002). Therefore, preschool children, including those entering kindergarten, should have a sense of quantitative reasoning. The transition to verbal problem-solving does not occur until they become familiar with conventional symbols (p. 112). Mathematical knowledge during preschool predicts later school success.Perry, B., MacDonald, A., & Gervasoni, A. (2015). Mathematics and transition to school. International perspectives. However, preschool and kindergarten students in low-income settings have been shown to have significantly less developed mathematical skills than students from middle-income homes. As such, particular attention has been given to developing math interventions.  Social Emotional Well- being  The transition to Kindergarten often requires children to adapt to a new and different environment. This new environment is typically more structured and filled with more prolonged social engagement than their home environment. Children use their social and emotional abilities in order to navigate this new and unfamiliar environment. Although social and emotional skills are sometimes not included in definitions of Kindergarten readiness, focus groups surveys indicate that teachers often advocate that developed social skills are more important than academic skills as children enter school. Social skills function as tools to help children learn more quickly and promote peer acceptance, contributing to a more positive outlook on school. = Social and Emotional Development = Between the ages of 3-6 children undergo dramatic development in their social and cognitive abilities. The development of these skills provides them with the tools to navigate the social context of a kindergarten classroom. These developments become obvious during children's social interactions that transform from playing alongside of their peers, to more complex and coordinated play amongst peers. This transformation in social abilities comes about not only from an increase in language abilities, and increasing self-regulation abilities, but also from the quickly developing ability to consider other people's perspectives. Perspective taking allows children to take into account others‚Äô points of view, and to appreciate that others‚Äô points of view may be different from their own. This ability develops rapidly between ages 3‚Äì6 and continues to develop throughout adolescence. Not only is it important for children entering kindergarten to be able to take into account their peers‚Äô points of view, it is also important for them to be able to consider their teacher's perspective The ability to consider others‚Äô perspectives also gives way to the development of social empathy. Children begin to appreciate that other people can experience emotions that are different from their own, and that their actions towards others can affect their emotions. This developing understanding, paired with their increasing self-regulation abilities, enables children to interact and develop meaningful relationships, as well as the ability to successfully manage conflicts. In addition to promoting positive peer relationships, successfully managing the social environment of the kindergarten classroom also contributes to more positive academic outcomes. Through more positive social interactions, children are better able to access the resources that they need to thrive in the classroom setting. For example, if the child is able to appropriately and effectively interact with the teacher, the child is more likely to receive assistance and attention when necessary. Additionally, if the child is able to engage and participate with her peers, it is more likely that she will be included and form more meaningful relationships, thereby associating school with positive experiences. = Parent's Role = Children's development does not occur in a vacuum. They are constantly being influenced by the environments that they are surrounded by. At the same time, children's behaviours and reactions have an effect on their environments as well.Bronfenbrenner, U., & Evans, G. W. (2000). Developmental science in the 21st century: Emerging questions, theoretical models, research designs and empirical findings. Social development, 9(1), 115-125. During the preschool years, children spend the majority of their time surrounded by their immediate family. Therefore, the family environment will significantly influence how a child develops during this age period. Therefore, parents play an important role concerning their child's readiness for the kindergarten classroom. In fact, children have better academic skills when their relationship with family is characterized as warm, accepting, involved and when parents value education (Hill, 2001). Furthermore, parent-child interactions that are structured and responsive are positively related to school readiness. A key aspect in this type of parent- child interaction is being sensitive to the child's skill level in order to provide the appropriate amount of support when guiding the child's learning. This type of guidance is known as scaffolding, in which the level of support given to the child decreases as the child's skill level increases on a given task. Just as scaffolding around a building is removed as the building gets nearer to completion, the amount of help that is provided to the child decreases as the child begins to master a certain task. The decreasing amount of support allows the child to have more autonomy which gives them the opportunity to practice their newly developing skills. Scaffolding can be implemented in any type of learning, but is especially helpful in the preschool age-range to teach about conflict resolution in social settings, emotion regulation, and problem solving. = Teacher's Role = When children enter Kindergarten, they experience a shift from the family acting as a primary influence on the child's development, to an increased influence from their classroom environment. An important factor that contributes to how well a child adapts to the Kindergarten environment is his/her relationship with the teacher. When children form a close relationship with their teacher, they appear better adjusted within the kindergarten context compared to when a conflictual relationship is developed. Children feel more comfortable approaching their teacher, as well as expressing their thoughts and feelings when a warm and open relationship is developed. This allows the child to effectively use the teacher as a means for support. This support can come in the form of social, emotional, or academic assistance which ultimately contributes to promoting the child's opportunities for success in the Kindergarten classroom. The teacher-child relationship has also been shown to be affected through intervention strategies. For example, the Chicago School Readiness Project trained teachers in classroom behaviour management strategies in order to promote greater emotional support in the classroom. Children in classrooms whose teachers‚Äô received the intervention showed better self-regulation, fewer behaviour problems, and better academic skills compared to children in classrooms whose teachers had not received the training.  Motor and Sensory Development  Upon entering kindergarten most children should have passed certain developmental milestones in their motor and sensory development. Fine motor development, which involves manipulating small objects and forming pencil grips are necessary for the development of other academic skills. For example, by age five, children usually possess the fine motor skills to allow them to print some letters, draw a person with a head, a body, legs, and arms, as well as other shapes, such as triangles, squares, and circles. Similarly, they can also manipulate scissors to cut a straight line, use a fork and knife effectively, and tie their shoelaces. Fine motor skills upon entering kindergarten are associated with academic performance in reading and writing in later grades (QLSCD 1998-2010), as well as academic achievement in mathematics.Pivik, Jayne (2012). Environmental Scan of School Readiness for Health: Definitions, Determinants, Indicators and Interventions. Vancouver, BC, Canada: Human Early Learning Partnership with the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health. Developmental milestones for gross motor development include learning to skip, catching a ball, jumping over small objects, and walking down stairs using alternate feet and a handrail. The peak period of development for motor skills occurs from birth to age five. As such, children entering kindergarten can walk, run, jump, and climb and are developing control of their bodies. Sensory developmental milestones are also used as indicators of kindergarten readiness. For example, by age five, children should know their colours, count using their fingers, manipulate a book and read it from left to right, and draw pictures that represent animals, objects, or people.  Oral Language Development  Oral-language development involves the development of receptive language, which is the ability to understand when spoken to, and expressive language, which is the ability to produce language. Kindergarten readiness requires development in both. For example, students are expected to have a vocabulary of approximately 2000 words by age five; Canadian Language & Literacy Research Network, 2009). Similarly, they are expected to be using approximately five to eight words in a sentence. In general, however, children entering kindergarten are expected to understand instructions and communications from adults and peers (Pivik, 2012). They are also expected to communicate their needs and ideas in a way that can be understood by others. Simply stated, they must be able to use language as a tool to be functional within the kindergarten setting. Oral language is of particular importance for children entering kindergarten as it is a predictor and necessary requirement of literacy development (Hill, 2011). However, the transition from oral-language development to literacy is not clearly defined and hierarchical. Rather, it is a multidimensional and complex transition (p. 52). Nevertheless, oral language development provides the framework and opportunity for children to develop literacy skills. Children are able to build upon their previously mastered oral skills or vocabulary to help them learn new skills, such as reading or writing. Oral language can be taught explicitly and implicitly through play. For example, dramatic play can allow for the child to take on different roles and use language as a tool in different contexts (Hill, 2011). Play also has a positive impact on literacy, self-regulation, and social-understanding (Van Reet, 2012). For example, play is strongly related to language development in the form of procedural knowledge, such as how to apply proper grammar, which occurs through observation and exposure, as opposed to direct instruction (p. 20).  Inhibitory Control and Attention  In order to learn and engage in a classroom environment, children must be able to direct their attention effectively. Specifically, children need to be able to extract the important messages from the surrounding noise or distractions. Adults are much more adept at blocking out distracting information in their environment compared to children. Therefore, the distractions that might impact a child's ability to focus his or her attention may be difficult for an adult to appreciate. Distractions can present themselves in the form of auditory sounds, such as other children talking in the classroom, noise from a television, cars driving by outside, etc. However, visual information can also be distracting to children, hindering them from properly focusing their attention. For instance, if a child is attempting to concentrate on a given task in a room where there are many interesting things around her, the abundance of visual information will make it harder for her to concentrate on the task at hand. The more distractions that are present in the child's environment, the more effortful it will be for the child to effectively focus her attention. Another important aspect of learning involves the ability to discern what is relevant from what is not. In everyday conversation we are continuously picking out the important parts of what is being said in order to commit the relevant information to memory. This skill is particularly important for children to be able to learn and follow instructions in a classroom environment. When young children listen to someone speaking, such as instructions from a teacher, it is important for them to be able to pick out the important information so that they are able to do what has been asked. Another area in which children often show difficulty is engaging in a new task. This is a necessary skill in kindergarten given the continuous switching of activities that happens throughout the day. Many children have little trouble focusing on a particular activity, but when asked to switch, have difficulty on the next. This can decrease their performance on the new task, or hinder their ability to learn from it. The cognitive ability that is implicated in these situations is known as inhibitory control (IC). Inhibitory control is known as the ability to inhibit a prepotent (or initial) response, and instead respond with a more appropriate action. This term is used somewhat interchangeably with related terms such as, self-regulation, effortful control, attentional control, etc. However, the divide between the terms is not substantive (Allan et al. 2014). The preschool age marks a time of rapid development of inhibitory control, and not surprisingly, plays an important role in children's adjustment to kindergarten. Although there is marked development, the relationship between IC and other developmental outcomes (e.g., academic, social, etc.) remains intact. Inhibitory control is important in many aspects of kindergarten readiness but is particularly relevant to children's academic outcomes. Although IC is implicated in both literacy and math skills, is it particularly important for math. IC has been measured using a variety of methods. Namely, researchers typically use behavioural methods, in which children are asked to complete short tasks that require the use of IC. Researchers also use reports in the forms of surveys from parents and teachers. Typically, behavioural methods and teacher reports have the closest relationship to children's academic outcomes. Both of these methods can reveal important information when investigating the relationship between IC and academic performance as they lend information from different contexts, with behavioural methods providing information about the child's objective abilities, and teacher reports providing information about the subjective classroom experience. Together these methods provide a more complete understanding of the relationship. An important consideration is that difficulties that children may have in regards to focusing their attention becomes amplified when they are experiencing strong emotions. It is also important to rule out physical problems (hearing and vision) as they may present themselves as an attention problem but can be easily remedied with heading or visual aid  At-risk Children  There are four key risk factors that are associated with educational disadvantages upon entry into kindergarten in the United States. They include having a mother with less than a high school education, living in a family that receives food stamps or welfare, living in a single-parent home, and having parents whose native tongue is other than English (United States Department of Education, 2001). Individuals with a single risk factor are likely to lag in reading or writing skills; those with multiple risk factors have a 50% chance of scoring in the bottom quartiles in reading, mathematics, or general knowledge. For example, those with multiple risk factors are less likely to know the alphabet or be able to count to 20 before beginning kindergarten, which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison to other students without risk factors (p. 21). Families who live in poverty are generally less able to provide learning opportunities, such as books or toys to their children. Lack of school readiness has been linked with later school dropout. However, longitudinal studies in Quebec suggest that social-emotional and social skills training can help some students improve their academic paths and eventually graduate from high school. Parents and family environments can play a protective role against the risk of educational disadvantage. In fact, the home and family environments have the greatest impact on whether or not a child is ready to begin school (Pivik, 2012). For example, parents have many roles in preparing children for kindergarten, including providing the child with proper nutrition, health care, and opportunity for growth. Families can also act as advocates, teachers, and providers for their children.  New Types of Learning  Recent discussions have moved from the traditional focus of developing the ‚Äúthree R‚Äôs‚Äù to considering skills that are inherent to the digital age. For example, through exposure to tablets, children are learning traditional skills in new ways. As opposed to manipulating books and toys, many children spend their time learning via technology. Literacy apps, videos, and games are most commonly used. However, the manipulation of the iPad itself lends to a different type of motor development than traditional paper instruction, such as swiping, touching, and tapping (Burnett & Daniels, 2016). Nevertheless, children may have similar interactions when reading with adults using tablets as they might when using printed materials (Burnett & Daniels, 2016). Many efforts by large television networks has been directed at developing media content for pre-schoolers with the aim of fostering healthy social-emotional development (Nikolayev, Clark, & Reich, 2016). However, the online games that are targeted for social-emotional development among pre- school students are mostly focused on recognition of one's own emotional skills, relationships with adults, cooperative play with peers, or formation of self-identity (Nikolayev, Clark, & Reich, 2016). Most games also focus on modeling appropriate social behaviour as opposed to having children practice their own skills through the game.  Assessment  The Kindergarten Behaviour and Academic Competency Scale (KBACS): The KBACS is a questionnaire that is completed by a child's teacher in order to assess the child's readiness for school. The teacher rates the child across a variety of domains such as following classroom rules, completing work, etc. using a 5-point scale (ranging from poor to excellent). Studies have shown that the KBACS is associated with other measures of school readiness, and has excellent test- retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .82; Granziano et al. 2015). The Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA): The BSRA is a widely used kindergarten readiness test that measures a child's exposure to concepts that support learning at school. It contains five subtests assessing knowledge of colours, letters, numbers/counting, size/comparisons, and shapes. Unlike a questionnaire, the BSRA is structured as a set of tests to be completed with the child. The BSRA is used in some public and private schools to determine eligibility for gifted and talented programs. Studies have shown that children's scores on the BSRA are predictive of their later academic outcomes (Panter & Bracken, 2009). The Early Development Instrument (EDI): The EDI is a questionnaire that is completed by a child's teacher. It was designed to measure children's school readiness and has been described as a holistic, or multidimensional approach as it includes measures outside of the academic domain. It contains 104 items and measures five domains including, physical health and well-being (e.g., gross and fine motor skills, physical independence, etc.), social competence (e.g., responsibility and respect, approaches to learning, etc.), emotional maturity (e.g., prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity and inattention, etc.), language and cognitive development (e.g., basic numeracy, basic literacy, etc.), and communication skills and general knowledge (e.g., ability to communicate needs, ability to tell a story, etc.) (Janus & Offord, 2007). Studies have shown that the EDI is a good predictor of children's early school achievement, especially with children on the extreme ends of the rating scale (i.e., exceptionally low scores or exceptionally high scores.) (Boivin & Bierman) The Diagnostic Screening Test of School Readiness ‚Äì Revised The Diagnostic Screening Test of School Readiness is commonly known as the Lollipop test and is a measure of school readiness that focuses on academic components of readiness. It contains four subtests including, identification of colours and shapes and copying shapes, spatial recognition, identification of numbers and counting, and identification of letters and writing. These subtests are administered to a child individually. The test was designed to be quick and easy to administer and studies have shown that children's scores on the Lollipop test are associated with other measures of school readiness, and is predictive early school achievement (Chew 1987, Boivin & Bierman).

She has been a steady presence on rock radio stations in the New York City area since 1973. She began her broadcasting career as a college undergraduate, and stayed with it even after she completed graduate studies in law school. She rose to prominence at WPLJ-FM and then moved to WNEW-FM. She has been heard most recently on WAXQ-FM (\\"Q-104.3\\") and Sirius XM. Miller is an ardent champion of classic rock music. In addition to her live radio program, she also helms a weekly Led Zeppelin tribute show, Get the Led Out, which has been in syndication since 1984. Her autobiography, Up All Night: My Life and Times in Rock Radio, was published in 2012. Early life Carol Miller was born in 1951 Queens, New York. At the age of 10, she and her family moved to New Hyde Park in Long Island, where she attended Herricks High School. Later she went to the University of Pennsylvania and earned a degree in biology. While there, she developed a love of broadcasting by volunteering at the college radio station, and in late 1971 she began working professionally at the progressive rock station WMMR-FM in Philadelphia. She returned to New York to pursue a degree from Hofstra Law School, but still maintained her working position at WMMR. With help from her friend and fellow disc jockey Dennis Elsas, she even took on a second job, this one at WMMR's sister station in New York, WNEW-FM. Radio career Miller made her New York radio debut at WNEW in 1973, where she worked for a little over a year. According to colleague Richard Neer, she entered into a rivalry with the station's other female personality, veteran DJ Alison Steele aka \\"The Nightbird\\", and after Steele's complaints reached management, Neer claims Miller was dismissed. This account is disputed by Miller in her memoir Up All Night: My Life and Times in Rock Radio, and attributed to \\"scurrying underlings\\". Miller writes that she was not terminated by WNEW, but resigned.Miller, p. 124. She worked for the short- lived WQIV-FM in 1974, and began at WPLJ-FM in the following year. Her evening show was part of a talent roster on WPLJ that proved very successful, and included Tony Pigg, Pat St. John, and John Zacherle, and Jim Kerr. One of Miller's favorite musical artists is Bruce Springsteen, and while she was at WPLJ she became the very public voice of a drive to make \\"Born to Run\\" the New Jersey state anthem. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful, but on June 12, 1979, the New Jersey General Assembly acknowledged its widespread support and declared \\"Born to Run\\" to be the state's \\"Unofficial Youth Rock Anthem\\". She returned to WNEW in 1983. In 1985 she even found a niche on television, reporting on new music in 90-second spots for Entertainment Tonight. In addition to her live show, she began a feature on her program, Get the Led Out, in 1984. The now widely syndicated show, Carol Miller's Get The Led Out (United Stations Radio Networks,) chronicles the history of Led Zeppelin. Miller's former producer Denny Somach authored a Led Zeppelin overview based on her syndicated show. Also titled Get the Led Out, the extensively illustrated coffee-table book was published by Sterling in 2013. Miller currently appears on New York radio station WAXQ-FM (\\"Q-104.3\\") as well as Sirius XM‚Äôs Deep Tracks, Classic Rewind, and other channels. She still plays her preferred musical style: \\"Classic rock is not an oldies format. It‚Äôs a lifestyle format. I don‚Äôt see it as part of the past at all.\\" Miller's memoir, which also chronicles her extensive battles with breast and endometrial cancers, Up All Night: My Life and Times in Rock Radio, was published in 2012.

Walking vehicles have been constructed with anywhere from one to more than eight legs. There are many designs for the leg mechanisms of walking machines that provide foot trajectories with different properties. Walking vehicles are classified according to the number of legs with common configurations being one leg (pogo stick or \\"hopper\\"), two legs (biped), four legs (quadruped), and six legs (hexapod). There are a few prototypes of walking vehicles. Currently almost all of these are experimental or proof of concept. Mobility Walking vehicles can provide greater ground clearance than wheeled or tracked vehicles, but the complexity of their leg mechanisms has limited their use. Examples of manned walking vehicles include General Electric's Walking truck, the University of Duisburg-Essen's ALDURO. Timberjack, a subsidiary of John Deere, built a practical hexapod Walking Forest Machine (harvester). One of the most sophisticated real-world walking vehicles is the Martin Montensano-built 'Walking Beast', a 7-ton quadrapod experimental vehicle suspended by four hydraulic binary-configuration limbs with much greater dexterity.

Turning is achieved by lifting both \\"feet\\" off the ground and pivoting on top of the base in the desired direction.

Honda has developed a number of humanoid robots that use a bipedal gait, starting with the experimental E series in the mid-1980s and culminating with the autonomous ASIMO, introduced in 2000. ASIMO has inspired a number of similar bipedal toy robots. Boston Dynamics develops complex walking robots that are capable of moving over rough terrain and avoiding obstacles.

In 1965, Dr. Denton A. Cooley and Dr. Grady L. Hallman, both of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, Texas, started a band made up of doctors.‚ÄúPresenting, The Heartbeats‚Äù, Album Liner Notes, Medical Classics No. 1001S, 1968. The band was named The Heartstrings because most of the doctors worked in cardiology and stringed instruments (Dr. Cooley played the upright bass) dominated the original lineup. The band quickly grew into a swing band featuring saxophones, trumpets and trombones, thus prompting the changing of the band‚Äôs name to The Heartbeats. The Heartbeats originally performed at parties for their medical colleagues. As the band became known around Houston, they were asked to perform at larger social events that were fundraisers for the Texas Heart Institute and other medical institutions in Houston, as well as for organizations that support the arts, such as the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston.\\"Dr. Denton Cooley: King of Hearts,\\" Innovator, Summer 2001, St. Luke's Episcopal Health System, Houston, TX. The band most commonly performed a short (about 30 minutes) set during the event. Working as such, The Heartbeats shared the bandstand with some of Houston‚Äôs top dance bands. The Heartbeats recorded in 1968 an album of popular music titled ‚ÄúPresenting, The Heartbeats.‚Äù Among the tunes covered were Tijuana Taxi, Java, Yesterday, and When the Saints Go Marching In. Proceeds from the sale of the album went to the Texas Heart Institute for the construction of additional facilities at the Baylor St. Luke‚Äôs Medical Center and Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital and for research and teaching in the field of heart disease. A second album of popular music titled ‚ÄúThe Heartbeats Again‚Äù was released in 1972, again with proceeds benefitting the Texas Heart Institute. Tunes on this second album include Classical Gas; A String of Pearls; Mercy, Mercy, Mercy; and What the World Needs Now. The make-up of the band evolved over the years as some of the original members left the Houston area and new members joined. By the mid-1970s, the band had migrated away from the Texas Heart Institute and was then made up of doctors with a wide range of specialties. In 1974, the name of the band was changed to the Jazz Medics in a reflection of this increasing professional diversity.Green, Alison, ‚ÄúHouston‚Äôs Jazz Medics prescribe big band sound,‚Äù Houston Chronicle, June 19, 1991. Today, the Jazz Medics remains a volunteer band, primarily performing for groups at retirement homes, hospices, private events, and the like in the Houston area.

Neutral countries and belligerents variously made multiple peace proposals; none of them progressed very far. Some were neutral efforts to end the horrors. Others involved propaganda ploys to show one's own side as reasonable and the other side as obstinate. See Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

War aims Years later a myth grew up that the crowds and all the belligerent nations cheered and welcomed the war. That was not true ‚Äì everywhere there was a deep sense of foreboding. In wartime Britain, and in neutral United States, reports of German atrocities and killing thousands of civilians, rounding up hostages, and destroying historic buildings and libraries caused a change of heart to an antiwar population. For example, suffragists took up the cause of the war, as did intellectuals. Very few expected a short happy war ‚Äì the slogan \\"over by Christmas\\" was coined three years after the war began.Robert Tombs, The English and their history (2014) p 612. Historians find that, \\"The evidence for mass enthusiasm at the time is surprisingly weak.\\" =Allied war goals= In 1914 the war was so unexpected that no one had formulated long-term goals. An ad-hoc meeting of the French and British ambassadors with the Russian Foreign Minister in early September led to a statement of war aims that was not official, but did represent ideas circulating among diplomats in St. Petersburg, Paris, and London, as well as the secondary allies of Belgium, Serbia, and Montenegro. Its provisions included:W. Henry Cooke and Edith P. Stickney, eds. Readings in European International Relations since 1870 (1931) pp. 418‚Äì19 *1) \\" The principal object of the three allies should be to break German power and its claim to military and political domination;\\" * 2) \\"Territorial modifications are to be determined according to the principle of nationality;\\" * 3) Russia should annex certain parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. * 4) \\"France should take back Alsace-Lorraine, adding to it if she likes part of Rhenish Prussia and of the Palatine;\\" * 5-7, provisions for new territory for Belgium and Denmark, and the restoration of the Kingdom of Hanover. * 8) Austria should become a triple monarchy, upgrading the kingdom of Bohemia. * 9) \\"Serbia should annex Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, and northern Albania;\\" * 10-11. Territory should be added to Bulgaria and Greece. * 12) \\"England, France, and Japan should divide the German colonies;\\" * 13) \\"Germany and Austria should pay a war indemnity.\\" No official statement of Allied war aims was issued. The secret treaties remained secret until the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia in November 1917 and began publishing them. Socialists had always alleged that capitalists were behind the war in order to line their own pockets, and the evidence of promised new territories invigorated left-wing movements around the world. President Woodrow Wilson regained some of the initiative in January 1918 when he proclaimed his Fourteen Points, the first of which demanded, \\"Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.\\" Historian Hew Strachan argues that war aims focused on territorial gains were not of central importance anyway. They did not cause the war nor shape its course of action. Rather, he says: :Big ideas, however rhetorical, shaped the war's purpose more immediately and completely than did more definable objectives....[According to best-selling English author H. G. Wells], 'We fight', he declared, 'not to destroy a nation, but to kill a nest of ideas....Our business is to kill ideas. The ultimate purpose of this war is propaganda, the destruction of certain beliefs and the creation of others.'Hew Strachan, The First World War: Volume I To Arms (2001) p. 1115. =German war goals= The Germans never finalized a set of war aims. However, in September 1914, Kurt Riezler, a senior staff aide to German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg sketched out some possible ideas‚Äîdubbed by historians the \\"September Program.\\" It emphasized economic gains, turning all of Central and Western Europe into a common market controlled by and for the benefit of Germany. Belgium would become a vassal state, there would be a series of naval bases threatening England, and Germany would seize much of Eastern Europe from Russia ‚Äì as in fact it did in early 1918. There would be a crippling financial indemnity on France making it economically dependent on Germany. The Netherlands would become a dependent satellite, and British commerce would be excluded. Germany would rebuild a colonial empire in Africa. The ideas sketched by Riezler were not fully formulated, were not endorsed by Bethmann- Hollweg, and were not presented to or approved by any official body. The ideas were formulated on the run after the war began, and did not mean these ideas had been reflected a prewar plan, as historian Fritz Fischer fallaciously assumed. However they do indicate that if Germany had won it would have taken a very aggressive dominant position in Europe. Indeed, it took a very harsh position on occupied Belgian and France starting in 1914, and in the Treaty of Brest Litovsk imposed on Russia in 1917, which liberated many of the subject peoples of Russia from Finland to Ukraine.Tombs, The English and their history (2014) p 611.Wayne C. Thompson, \\"The September Program: Reflections on the Evidence.\\" Central European History 11.4 (1978): 348-354. The stalemate by the end of 1914 forced serious consideration of long-term goals. Britain, France, Russia and Germany all separately concluded this was not a traditional war with limited goals. Britain, France and Russia became committed to the destruction of German military power, and Germany to the dominance of German military power in Europe. One month into the war, Britain, France and Russia agreed not to make a separate peace with Germany, and discussions began about enticing other countries to join in return for territorial gains. However, as Barbara Jelavich observes, \\"Throughout the war Russian actions were carried out without real coordination or joint planning with the Western powers.\\"Barbara Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814-1974 (1974) pp. 281‚Äì84. There was no serious three-way coordination of strategy, nor was there much coordination between Britain and France before 1917. =Approaches to diplomacy= Both sides employed secret treaties to entice neutral nations to join them in return for a promise of spoils when victory was achieved. They were kept secret until the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia in 1917 and began publishing all the details on the Allied side. The Allies especially promised that after defeating the Ottoman Empire they would give large slices in return for immediate help in the war. Some territories were promised to several recipients, on the principle that conflicts could be sorted out after victory was achieved. Some promises, therefore, had to be broken, and that left permanent bitter legacies, especially in Italy.J.A.S. Grenville, ed., The Major International Treaties of the Twentieth Century: A History and Guide with Texts, Vol. 1 (Taylor & Francis, 2001) p. 61.Norman Rich, Great Power Diplomacy: Since 1914 (2002) pp. 12‚Äì20. Important secret treaties of this era include the secretly concluded treaty of Ottoman‚ÄìGerman alliance signed on August 2, 1914. It provided that Germany and Turkey would remain neutral in the conflict between Austria- Hungary and Serbia, but if Russia intervened \\"with active military measures\\" the two countries would become military allies.Grenville, pp. 62‚Äì63. Another important secret treaty was the Treaty of London, concluded on April 26, 1915, in which Italy was promised certain territorial concessions in exchange for joining the war on the Triple Entente (Allied) side.Grenville, p. 63. The Treaty of Bucharest was concluded between Romania and the Entente powers (Britain, France, Italy, and Russia) on August 17, 1916; under this treaty, Romania pledged to attack Austria-Hungary and not to seek a separate peace in exchange for certain territorial gains. Article 16 of that treaty provided that \\"the present arrangement shall be held secret.\\"Grenville, pp. 63‚Äì66. Blaming the war in part on secret treaties, President Wilson called in his Fourteen Points for \\"open covenants, openly arrived at.\\" The two sides had strikingly different approaches to diplomacy. The military leadership of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his deputy General Erich Ludendorff increasingly controlled Germany and the other Central Powers. They worked around the Kaiser and largely ignored the politicians and diplomats; they focused on military supremacy.Robert B. Asprey, Hindenburg & Ludendorff: The German High Command at War (1991). The most dramatic example came when military command decided on unrestricted submarine warfare against Britain in early 1917, over the objections of Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg and other civilian leaders. Historian Cathal Nolan says their strategy was, \\"Germans must win fast and win everything or lose everything in a war of exhaustion: knock out Russia in 1917, defeat France and starve Britain, all before the Americans arrived in sufficient numbers to make a real difference on the Western Front.\\" A military approach meant that victory was to be achieved by winning great campaigns against the main enemy armies. Allies were useful for providing hundreds of thousands of bayonets, and access to critical geographical points. The Allies had a more complex multi-dimensional approach that included critical roles for diplomacy, finance, propaganda and subversion.Victor Rothwell, British war aims and peace diplomacy, 1914-1918 (Oxford UP, 1971). By 1917 talk of a compromise solution was suppressed and the British and French war aim was to permanently destroy German militarism. When the United States joined in, Woodrow Wilson likewise in his 14 points emphasized the need to destroy militarism.D. Newton, \\"The Lansdowne 'Peace Letter' of 1917 and the Prospect of Peace by Negotiation with Germany\\" Australian Journal of Politics & History (2002) 48#1 pp 16-39. Austria and Turkey were not the main targets, and a separate peace with either or both of them was always an option. The Allies bargained with neutrals such as Italy by promising them when victory came, the Central Powers would be broken up and critical territories would be given to the winners. In the Treaty of London (1915) Italy was promised several large slices of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.C.J. Lowe, \\"Britain and Italian Intervention 1914-1915.\\" Historical Journal (1969) 12#3 533-548. Russia was promised Constantinople in the Constantinople Agreement of 1915. the Jews were promised a homeland in Palestine in the Balfour Declaration of 1917, but the Arabs had already been promised a sovereign state in Turkish-controlled regions. Aspiring nationalities were promised their own homelands. France was promised Alsace- Lorraine, which had been ceded to Germany in 1871. In terms of finance, the British generously loaned money to Russia, France, Italy and smaller allies. When British money ran out, the United States replaced it in early 1917 with even larger loans. The Allies put a heavy emphasis on \\"soft power\\" including economic aid and trade, and propaganda. For example, Britain cut off all shipments of cotton to Germany, but at the same time subsidized the American cotton industry by large purchases, to make sure that the rural South supported the war effort. Historians Richard D. Heffner and Alexander Heffner point to the \\"outstanding success of British propaganda\\" in molding American opinion, while \\"Germany's feeble propaganda effort proved highly ineffective.\\" Allied propaganda emphasised the triumph of liberal ideas, and a war to end all wars‚Äîthemes with a broad international appeal. The Germans kept quiet about their war aims of dominating all of Europe, for they realized it would not have a wide appeal. However, the German Foreign Ministry realized the value of subversion in a total war. It used money and propaganda to attempt to undermine morale of the allies, including Muslims in the British, Russian and Ottoman empires. They had even more success in subsidizing far left anti-war subversive elements, especially in Russia.David Welch, Germany, propaganda and total war, 1914-1918 (2000). Allied propaganda focused on identifying Germany with militarism and illustrating it with what it called the rape of Belgium as well as with the sinking of the Lusitania. The Allies were embarrassed by its large Russian ally‚Äîit was a non-democratic autocracy that sponsored pogroms. The overthrow of the Tsarist regime in March 1917 by Russian liberals greatly facilitated American entry into the war as President Wilson could for the first time proclaim a crusade for idealistic goals. Germany avoided internal discussions of its war aims, because debate threatened political unity at home and with allies. As late as May 1917 the Chancellor warned the Reichstag that a discussion of war aims would be unwise.Marquis, \\"Propaganda,\\" p 482; Stevenson, \\"First World War pp. 93, 100. In January 1917 Germany made a major strategic blunder that historian Hew Strachan speculates may have cost it victory in the war. The German navy launched a full-scale blockade of Britain, using its U-boats to sink all merchant ships of whatever nationality without warning. This was in violation of international law and of its solemn promises to the United States. The military made the decision, rejecting civilian advice, knowing it meant war with the United States but it was Germany's last chance for a decisive victory before the Americans would be able to fully mobilize. By ignoring civilian advice the military failed to appreciate that Britain was financially bankrupt, and could no longer purchase needed raw materials nor provide urgently needed financial aid to its friends. Strachan maintains the new German submarine strategy \\"saved Britain\\" because Berlin had lost sight of how close it was to success in ruining the critical financial component of British strategy.Strachan, The First World War: Volume I To Arms (2001) pp. 974‚Äì75 =Toward a League of Nations= In the course of the war both sides had to clarify their long-term war aims. By 1916 in Britain and in neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organization to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of David Lloyd George took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organization, when Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position regarding the postwar, he endorsed such an organization. Wilson himself Included in his Fourteen Points in January 1918 a \\"league of nations to insure peace and justice.\\" British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \\"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\\"Peter Yearwood, \\"‚ÄòOn the Safe and Right Lines‚Äô: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916‚Äì1918.\\" Historical Journal 32#1 (1989): 131‚Äì155. Financing the war The total direct cost of war, for all participants including those not listed here, was about $80 billion (in 1913 US dollars) Since $1 billion in $1913 = about $25 billion in 2017 US dollars the total cost comes to about $2 trillion in 2017 dollars. Direct cost is figured as actual expenditures during war minus normal prewar spending. It excludes postwar costs such as pensions, interest, and veteran hospitals. Loans to/from allies are not included in \\"direct cost.\\" Repayment of loans after 1918 is not included.Harvey Fisk, The Inter-Ally Debts: An Analysis of War and Post-War Public Finance, 1914-1923 (1924) pp. 1, 21‚Äì37. The book is online at Questia The total direct cost of the war as a percent of wartime national income: * Allies: Britain, 37%; France, 26%; Italy, 19%; Russia, 24%; United States, 16%. * Central Powers: Austria-Hungary, 24%; Germany, 32%; Turkey unknown. The amounts listed below are presented in terms of 1913 US dollars, where $1 billion then equals about $25 billion in 2017.Fisk, The Inter-Ally Debts pp. 21‚Äì37. *Britain had a direct war cost about $21.2 billion; it made loans to Allies and Dominions of $4.886 billion, and received loans from the United States of $2.909 billion. *France had a direct war cost about $10.1 billion; it made loans to Allies of $1.104 billion, and received loans from Allies (United States and Britain) of $2.909 billion. *Italy had a direct war cost about $4.5 billion; it received loans from Allies (United States and Britain) of $1.278 billion. * The United States had a direct war cost about $12.3 billion; it made loans to Allies of $5.041 billion. *Russia had a direct war cost about $7.7 billion; it received loans from Allies (United States and Britain) of $2.289 billion.Peter Gatrell, Russia's First World War: A Social and Economic History (2005) pp 132-53 In 1914 Britain had by far the largest and most efficient financial system in the world.Christopher Godden, \\"The Business of War: Reflections on Recent Contributions to the Economic and Business Histories of the First World War.\\" ≈íconomia. History, Methodology, Philosophy 6#4 (2016): 549-556. online Roger Lloyd-Jones and M. J. Lewis argue: :To prosecute industrial war required the mobilisation of economic resources for the mass production of weapons and munitions, which necessarily entitled fundamental changes in the relationship between the state (the procurer), business (the provider), labour (the key productive input), and the military (the consumer). In this context, the industrial battlefields of France and Flanders intertwined with the home front that produced the materials to sustain a war over four long and bloody years.Roger Lloyd-Jones and M. J. Lewis, Arming the Western Front: War, Business and the State in Britain, 1900‚Äì1920 (Routledge, 2016), p 1. The two governments agreed that financially Britain would support the weaker Allies and that France would take care of itself.Martin Horn, Britain, France, and the financing of the First World War (2002) ch 1. In August 1914, Henry Pomeroy Davison, a Morgan partner, traveled to London and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the sole underwriter of war bonds for Great Britain and France. The Bank of England became a fiscal agent of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa. Over the course of the war, J.P. Morgan loaned about $1.5 billion (approximately $ billion in today's dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans. Morgan also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments. Britain made heavy loans to Tsarist Russia; the Lenin government after 1920 refused to honor them, causing long-term issues.Jennifer Siegel, For Peace and Money: French and British Finance in the Service of Tsars and Commissars (Oxford UP, 2014). In late 1917 Colonel House, President Wilson's representative, took the lead in organizing Allied non-military actions.David Trask, The United States in the Supreme War Council; American War Aims and Inter-Allied Strategy, 1917-1918 (1961). Operating under the authority of the Supreme War Council, new committees had specialized tasks. The Inter-Allied Finance Council handled the issues of distributing money among the Allies. The United States had virtually all the available money by 1917, and made all the decisions. It loaned large sums to the main players, including loans to England that were redistributed to smaller allies.Stephenson, 190. There were related councils dealing with purchases food, and shipping, including the Allied Council on War Purchases and Finance, the Inter‚ÄîAllied Food Council, the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive, the Inter-Allied Scientific Food Commission, the Inter‚ÄîAllied Maritime Council, and the Inter‚ÄîAllied Transport Council, among others. Allies = Great Britain= British diplomacy during the war focused on new initiatives in cooperation with the leading allies, promote propaganda efforts with neutrals, and initiatives to undermine the German economy, especially through a naval blockade. In 1915, an Allied conference began operations in Paris to coordinate financial support for allies, munitions productions, and rationing of raw materials to neutrals who might otherwise reship them to Germany. Britain established a blacklist, a shipping control commission and a ministry of blockade.R. J. Q. Adams, \\"Delivering the Goods: Reappraising the Ministry of Munitions: 1915-1916.\\" Albion 7#3 (1975): 232‚Äì244.G.R. Searle, A new England?: peace and war, 1886-1918 (2005) pp 663-741. Entry On 4 August, the British Government declared war in the King's name, taking Britain (and the Empire) into the Great War. Strategic risk posed by German control of the Belgian and ultimately French coast was considered unacceptable. Britain's relationship with her Entente partners, both France and Russia, were equally significant factors. The Foreign Secretary Edward Grey argued that the secret naval agreements whereby France deployed her fleet to the Mediterranean imposed a moral obligation on Britain to defend the Channel, even though they had not been approved by the Cabinet. What is more, in the event that Britain abandoned its Entente friends, it was feared that if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, Britain would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to attack. Domestic politics was a factor too as the antiwar Liberal Party was in power and decided on war to support France as it had long promised and to hold together and keep out the militaristic Conservatives. The issue of Belgium was not the real cause, but it was emphasized after the decision to win over Liberals who disliked warfare.G.R. Searle, A new England?: peace and war, 1886-1918 (2005) pp 517-25.Nigel Keohane, The Party of Patriotism: The Conservative Party and the First World War (2016). British Foreign office mandarin Eyre Crowe said: > \\"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must > happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate > Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and > Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England?

In Asia, The French would get the northern half, and the British would get the southern half. British Cabinet paid special attention to the status of Palestine, looking at multiple complex factors. The steady advance of British armies moving up from Egypt indicated that Palestine and nearby areas would soon be under Allied control, and it was best to announce plans before that happened. In October 1915, Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, promised Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca the Arab leader in Arabia, that Britain would support Arab national ambitions in return for cooperation against the Turks. London thought there so much new land would become available that what Balfour called a \\"small notch\\" given to the Jews would not be a problem. The Zionist movement was gaining strength in the Jewish communities across Europe, including Britain and the United States. Promising them a home land would galvanize their support. Different Christian groups, especially Biblically-oriented Protestants, had an intense interest in the Holy Land, and in the Biblical predictions that indicated Christ could not return until the Jews regained their promised land. Finally, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour himself had a long-standing concern with pogroms against Jews in Eastern Europe, and for years had been looking for ways to resettle them outside Russia. He had many in-depth conversations with the Zionist leader in Britain, Chaim Weitzman, and came up with a plan that Lloyd George and the cabinet approved. In November 1917, Balfour made a very short official announcement regarding Palestine. He promised a \\"national home\\" for the Jewish people, And said nothing would be done to prejudice the rights of the Arabs. He made no mention of statehood. His statement read: :His Majesty's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.Sidney H. Zebel, Balfour: A political biography (1973) pp. 237‚Äì48; \\"small notch\\" p. 248.R.J.Q. Adams, Balfour: The last grandee (2007) pp. 330‚Äì35. President Wilson had known about the plan since March but had been noncommittal whether to support it. Finally, London asked directly his opinion and he secretly told House to tell them that he approved it. Historian Frank W. Brecher says, Wilson's \\"deep Christian sentiment\\" led him to seek \\"a direct governing role in the Near East in the name of peace, democracy and, especially, Christianity.\\" In 1922, Congress officially endorsed Wilson's support through passage of the Lodge-Fish Resolution.Frank W. Brecher, \\"Woodrow Wilson and the Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict.\\" American Jewish Archives 39.1 (1987): 23-47.Richard Ned Lebow, Wilson and the Balfour Declaration.\\" Journal of Modern History 40.4 (1968): 501-523. in JSTOR The League of Nations incorporated the Declaration into the mandate over Palestine it awarded to Britain on 24 July 1922. On the other hand, pro- Palestinian historians have argued that Wilson and Congress ignored democratic values in favour of \\"biblical romanticism\\" When they endorsed the Declaration. They point to a pro-Zionist lobby, which was active at a time when the small number of unorganized Arab Americans were not heard. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department opposed the endorsement fearing it would alienate Arabs.Lawrence Davidson, \\"The past as prelude: Zionism and the betrayal of American democratic principles, 1917-48.\\" Journal of Palestine Studies 31.3 (2002): 21‚Äì35. In terms of British diplomacy, Danny Gutwein argues that the Declaration was the victory of the \\"radical\\" faction in the British government debating policy regarding the fate of the Ottoman Empire. The radicals proposed to partition that Empire in order to solidify Britain's control of the Middle East. The ‚Äúreformist‚Äù faction lost.Danny Gutwein, \\"The politics of the Balfour Declaration: Nationalism, imperialism and the limits of Zionist- British cooperation.\\" Journal of Israeli History 35.2 (2016): 117‚Äì152. Blockade of Germany The Blockade of Germany by the Royal Navy was a highly effective technique to prevent Germans from importing food, raw materials, and other supplies. It repeatedly violated neutral rights, and the United States repeatedly objected. British diplomacy had to deal with that crisis. The loophole in the blockade system was shipments to neutral countries, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, which then sold the supplies to Germany. To stop that the British closely monitored shipments to neutral countries, declared that almost all commodities were contraband and would be seized, rationed imports to neutrals, and searched neutral merchant ships in Allied ports. They also blacklisted American firms known to trade with Germany.Thomas A. Bailey, \\"The United States and the blacklist during the great war.\\" Journal of Modern History 6.1 (1934): 14-35. in JSTOR The United States protested but Wilson decided to tolerate Britain's policy.Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era 1910-1917 (1954) pp. 154‚Äì55. =France= By 1914 French foreign policy was based on an alliance with Russia, and an informal understanding with Britain; both assumed that the main threat was from Germany.Cody Nester, \\"France and the Great War: Belligerent Warmonger or Failed Peacekeeper?

Researching World War I: A Handbook (2003) pp 51‚Äì78 The crisis of 1914 was unexpected, and when Germany mobilized its forces in response to Russian mobilization, France also had to mobilize. Germany then invaded Belgium as part of its Schlieffen Plan to win the war by encircling Paris. The plan failed and the war settled into a very bloody deadlock on the Western Front with practically no movement until 1918.Philippe Bernard, Henri Dubief, and Anthony Forster. The decline of the Third Republic, 1914-1938 (1988) pp. 3‚Äì90. Britain took the lead in most diplomatic initiatives, but Paris was consulted on all key points.Anthony Adamthwaite, Grandeur and Misery: France's bid for power in Europe, 1914-1940 (1995), pp 16-39 The Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement of 1916 with Britain called for breaking up the Ottoman Empire and dividing it into spheres of French and British influence. France was to get control of southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.James Barr, A Line in the Sand: Britain, France and the Struggle That Shaped the Middle East (2012). French credit collapsed in 1916 and Britain began loaning large sums to Paris. The J.P. Morgan & Co bank in New York assumed control of French loans in the fall of 1916 and relinquished it to the U.S. government when the U.S. entered the war in 1917.Martin Horn, \\"External Finance in Anglo-French Relations in the First World War, 1914‚Äì1917.\\" The International History Review 17.1 (1995): 51‚Äì77.Fabien Cardoni, \\"The ‚Äòscience‚Äô of French public finances in the First World War.\\" Accounting History Review 24.2-3 (2014): 119‚Äì138. France suffered very heavy losses, in terms of battle casualties, financing, and destruction in the German-occupied areas. At the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, vengeance against defeated Germany was the main French theme, and Prime Minister Clemenceau was largely effective against the moderating influences of the British and Americans. France obtained large (but unspecified) reparations, regained Alsace-Lorraine and obtained mandates to rule parts of former German colonies in Africa.George Noble, Policies and opinions at Paris, 1919: Wilsonian diplomacy, the Versailles Peace, and French public opinion (1968). French and British soldiers and diplomats worked well together during the war, and it became a major goal of French diplomacy to permanently continue the close relationship, and also bring the United States into this democratic triad. However, London and Washington were unwilling to commit to using their military force to uphold the European order established at the Paris conference. Clemenceau had gone too far in making demands that destabilized central Europe, in the views of Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson. London reverted to pre-war priorities, emphasizing internal Imperial considerations, with the assumption that France would be something of a threat to British interests. The United States rejected any military alliance, and its foreign policy was in total confusion with the physical and mental collapse of president Wilson.Peter Jackson, \\"Great Britain in French Policy Conceptions at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.\\" Diplomacy & Statecraft 30.2 (2019): 358-397. =Russia= Leadership Historians agree on the poor quality of Russia's top leadership. The Tsar made all the final decisions, but he repeatedly was given conflicting advice and typically made the wrong choice. He set up a deeply flawed organizational structure that was inadequate for the high pressures and instant demands of wartime. Stevenson, for example, points to the \\"disastrous consequences of deficient civil-military liaison\\" where the civilians and generals were not in contact with each other. The government was entirely unaware of its fatal weaknesses and remained out of touch with public opinion; the foreign minister had to warn the tsar that \\"unless he yielded to the popular demand and unsheathed the sword on Serbia's behalf, he would run the risk of revolution and the loss of his throne.\\" The tsar yielded and lost his throne anyway. Stevenson concludes: :Russian decision-making in July [1914] was more truly a tragedy of miscalculation...a policy of deterrence that failed to deter. Yet [like Germany] it too rested on assumptions that war was possible without domestic breakdown, and that it could be waged with a reasonable prospect of success. Russia was more vulnerable to social upheaval than any other Power. Its socialists were more estranged from the existing order than those elsewhere in Europe, and a strike wave among the industrial workforce reached a crescendo with the general stoppage in St. Petersburg in July 1914.Stevenson, \\"The First World War and International Politics (1988) pp. 31‚Äì32. Tsar Nicholas II took personal command of the Army in 1915 and spent much of his time at Army headquarters near the front lines, where his proclivity to misjudge leadership qualities, and misunderstand strategy, did the most damage. Meanwhile, morale plunged on the home front, the soldiers lacked rifles and adequate food, the economy was stretched to the limits and beyond, and strikes became widespread. The Tsar paid little attention. Tsarina Alexandra, increasingly under the spell of Grigori Rasputin, inadvisedly passed along his suggested names for senior appointments to the tsar. Thus, in January 1916, the Tsar replaced Prime Minister Ivan Goremykin with Boris St√ºrmer. Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov was not a powerful player. Historian Thomas Otte finds that, \\"Sazonov felt too insecure to advance his positions against stronger men....He tended to yield rather than to press home his own views.... At the critical stages of the July crisis Sazonov was inconsistent and showed an uncertain grasp of international realities. The tsar fired Sazonov in July 1916 and gave his ministry as an extra portfolio to Prime Minister St√ºrmer. The French ambassador was aghast, depicting St√ºrmer as, \\"worse than a mediocrity ‚Äì a third rate intellect, mean spirit, low character, doubtful honesty, no experience, and no idea of state business.\\"Walter G. Moss, A History of Russia: volume I: to 1917 (1997) pp. 499‚Äì504, quote on p. 503 Propaganda One of Russia's greatest challenges was motivating its highly diverse population that often lacked loyalty to the tsar. One solution was to avoid conscripting certain distrusted ethnic minorities.Peter Gatrell, \\"Tsarist Russia at War: The View from Above, 1914‚ÄìFebruary 1917,\\" Journal of Modern History 87#4 (2015) 675‚Äì78 Another was a heavy dose of propaganda‚Äîusing cartoons and verbal jokes‚Äîthat ridiculed Kaiser Wilhelm II. The tactic backfired as Russians turned it against their own tsar.Hubertus Jahn, \\"Kaiser, Cossacks, and Kolbasniks: Caricatures of the German in Russian Popular Culture,\\" Journal of Popular Culture (1998) 31#4 109-122. The stories of miseries, defeats and incompetence told by recruits on leave home gave a more powerful and negative narrative to every village; local anti-draft riots became common.Josh Sanborn, \\"The mobilization of 1914 and the question of the Russian nation: A reexamination.\\" Slavic Review 59.2 (2000): 267-289. online Britain and France tried to meet Russia's problems with money and munitions, but the long supply line was so tenuous that Russian soldiers were very poorly equipped in comparison with their opponents in battle. Meanwhile, Berlin, aware of the near-revolutionary unrest in Russia in the previous decade, launched its own propaganda war. The Foreign Ministry disseminated fake news reports that had the desired effect of demoralizing Russian soldiers.Watson, Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War, 1914-1918 (2014). pp. 462‚Äì63. Berlin's most successful tactic was to support far-left Russian revolutionaries dedicated to attacking and overthrowing the tsar. The German foreign ministry provided over 50 million gold marks to the Bolsheviks, and in 1917 secretly transported Lenin and his top aides from their exile in Switzerland across Germany to Russia. Later that year they overthrew the liberal regime and began their march to control all of Russia.George Katkov, ‚ÄúGerman Foreign Office Documents on Financial Support to the Bolsheviks in 1917,‚Äù International Affairs 32#2 (April 1956), pp. 181‚Äì89 The Bolsheviks concentrated much of their propaganda on POWs from the German and Austrian armies. When Russia left the war in 1917 these prisoners returned home and many carried back support for revolutionary ideas that quickly swayed their comrades.Watson, Ring of Steel, pp 509-12. February Revolution When the tsarist regime collapsed internally in February 1917, it was succeeded for eight months by the Provisional Government, a liberal regime. Alexander Kerensky played a leading role and eventually became Prime Minister. Pavel Milyukov, leader of the moderate KADET party, became Foreign Minister.Melissa Kirschke Stockdale, Paul Miliukov and the Quest for a Liberal Russia, 1880-1918 (1996) pp. 208‚Äì50. Many ambassadors and senior aides were tsarist appointees who resigned, so that the Foreign Ministry could barely function. Kerensky and Milyukov wanted to continue the tsarist foreign policy especially regarding the war. They still hoped to gain control of The Straits around Constantinople. The British wanted to support Russian morale, while distrusting the depth of its popular support and capabilities. After long discussions the British settled on a cautious policy which was, \\"to give the impression of support for the Provisional Government, while at the same time delaying actual support in the form of munitions until the British needs were met and real evidence of Russian intention to prosecute the war actively was forthcoming.\\"Keith E. Neilson, \\"The Breakup of the Anglo-Russian Alliance: The Question of Supply in 1917\\" International History Review 3#1 &1981), pp. 62‚Äì75, quote on p. 65 The Provisional Government, even after giving Kerensky dictatorial powers, failed to meet the challenges of war weariness, growing discontent among peasants and workers, and intrigues by the Bolsheviks. Public opinion, especially in the Army, had turned against the sacrifices for a hopeless war. The Bolsheviks proposed a revolutionary foreign policy that would immediately end the war and promote revolution across Europe.Zeman, Diplomatic History pp 207 ‚Äì 42. Bolshevik versus White After Lenin and his Bolsheviks overthrew the Kerensky regime in the \\"October Revolution\\" of 1917 (it was November by the Western calendar) Russia plunged into civil war, pitting the Bolsheviks against a series of \\"White\\" opponents led by tsarist generals.Evan Mawdsley, The Russian Civil War (2009)Edward Acton et al. eds. Critical companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914-1921 (1997). Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland successfully broke away and became independent countries. Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan tried to do the same but were later retaken by the Bolsheviks. Lloyd George and French general Ferdinand Foch briefly considered an alliance with the Bolsheviks against Germany. Instead the Allies intervened militarily to guard against a German takeover, and in practice to help the counter-revolutionaries. interventionist forces arrived from Britain, the United States, Japan, as well as France, Estonia, Poland, and Finland. The Bolsheviks proved successful, and after defeating them all by 1920 consolidated its hold on what became the Soviet Union (USSR). Lenin moved the national capital to Moscow. Diplomatically the new country was an unrecognized pariah state; only the Danish Red Cross would talk to them officially. Moscow was excluded from the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. It was deeply distrusted because of its support for revolutionary movements across Europe. However, only the communist revolution in Hungary was successful, and then only for a few months. However, after the failure of sponsored uprisings, Lenin took a more peaceful approach and one by one set up trade relations and, after that, diplomatic relations with the powers, starting with Britain and Germany in 1921. The United States was the last to act, with official recognition in 1933.Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow, pp. 301‚Äì32. =Belgium= Although the German invasion of Belgium in 1914 was the major factor in causing British entry into the war, the government of Belgium itself played a small role in diplomatic affairs.E.H. Kossmann, The Low Countries, 1780-1940 (Oxford UP, 1978) pp 517-44. Its main role came as a recipient of relief from neutral countries, and its use by the Allies is a propaganda weapon against the Germans, and their emphasis on the atrocities involved in the Rape of Belgium. On 2 August 1914, the German government demanded that German armies be given free passage through Belgian territory. This was refused by the Belgian government on 3 August. King Albert I addressed his Parliament on 4 August, saying \\"Never since 1830 has a graver hour sounded for Belgium. The strength of our right and the need of Europe for our autonomous existence make us still hope that the dreaded events will not occur.\\" The same day German troops invaded at dawn. Almost all of Belgium was occupied for the entire war, with the exception of a sliver in the far west, which was under the control of the Belgian Army. The government itself was relocated to the city of Sainte- Adresse in France; it still controlled the Belgian Congo in Africa. Belgium officially continued to fight the Germans, but the amount of combat was nominal. Belgium never joined the Allies. However, its foreign minister Paul Hymans was successful in securing promises from the allies that amounted to co-belligerency. Britain, France and Russia pledged in the \\"Declaration of Sainte-Adresse\\" in February 1916 that Belgian would be included in the peace negotiations, its independence would be restored, and that it would receive a monetary compensation from Germany for the damages. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, Belgium officially ended its historic neutral status, and became first in line to receive reparations payments from Germany. However, it received only a small bit of German territory, and was rejected in its demands for all of Luxembourg and part of the Netherlands. It was given colonial mandates over the German colonies of Rwanda and Burundi. Hymans became the leading spokesman for the small countries at Paris, and became president of the first assembly of the new League of Nations. When war began in 1914, Hymans met with President Wilson in Washington and got major promises of relief and food support. Relief was directed primarily by an American Herbert Hoover and involved several agencies: Commission for Relief in Belgium, American Relief Administration, and Comit√© National de Secours et d'Alimentation.Johan Den Hertog, \\"The Commission for Relief in Belgium and the Political Diplomatic History of the First World War,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft (2010) 21#4 pp. 593‚Äì613. =Italy= The War was an unexpected development that forced the decision whether to honor the alliance with Germany and Austria. For six months Italy remained neutral, as the Triple Alliance was only for defensive purposes. Italy took the initiative in entering the war in spring 1915, despite strong popular and elite sentiment in favor of neutrality. Italy was a large, poor country whose political system was chaotic, its finances were heavily strained, and its army was very poorly prepared.William A. Renzi, In the Shadow of the Sword: Italy's Neutrality and Entrance Into the Great War, 1914‚Äì1915 (1987). The Triple Alliance meant little either to Italians or Austrians ‚Äì Vienna had declared war on Serbia without consulting Rome. Two men, Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino made all the decisions, as was typical in Italian foreign policy. They operated in secret, enlisting the king later on, but keeping military and political leaders entirely in the dark. They negotiated with both sides for the best deal, and got one from the Entente, which was quite willing to promise large slices of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including the Tyrol and Trieste, as well as making Albania a protectorate. Russia vetoed giving Italy Dalmatia. Britain was willing to pay subsidies and loans to get 36 million Italians as new allies who threatened the southern flank of Austria. =Japan= Japan joined the Allies, seized German holdings in China and in the Pacific islands, cut deals with Russia and put heavy pressure on China in order to expand.Naraoka S≈çchi, \\"Japan‚Äôs First World War- Era Diplomacy, 1914‚Äì15.\\" in Antony est and Oliviero Frattolillo, eds. Japan and the Great War (2015) pp. 35+ In 1915 it secretly made the Twenty-One Demands on the new and fragile Republic of China. The demands included control over former German holdings, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, as well as joint ownership of a major mining and metallurgical complex in central China, prohibitions on China's ceding or leasing any coastal areas to a third power, and other political, economic and military controls. The result was intended to reduce China to a Japanese protectorate. In the face of slow negotiations with the Chinese government, widespread anti-Japanese sentiment in China and international condemnation, Japan was obliged to withdraw the final group of demands when treaties were signed in May 1915.Strachan, The First World War: Volume I: To Arms (2003) 455-94. Japan's hegemony in northern China was facilitated through other international agreements. One with Russia in 1916 helped to further secure Japan's influence in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. Agreements with France, Britain, and the United States in 1917 recognized Japan's new territorial gains. Japanese loans to China tied it even closer. After the Bolshevik takeover Russia in late 1917 the Japanese army moved to occupy Russian Siberia as far west as Lake Baikal. After getting China to allow transit rights, more than 70,000 Japanese troops joined the much smaller units of the Allied expeditionary force sent to Siberia in July 1918 as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.Frederick R. Dickinson, War and National Reinvention: Japan in the Great War, 1914-1919 (Harvard U. Asia Center, 1999). =China= China was neutral at the start of the war, but that left her in a weak position as Japanese and British military forces in 1914 liquidated Germany's holdings in China.Madeleine Chi, China Diplomacy, 1914-1918 (Harvard Univ Asia Center, 1970) Japan occupied the German military colony in Qingdao, and occupied portions of Shandong Province. China was financially chaotic, highly unstable politically, and militarily very weak. Its best hope was to attend the postwar peace conference, and hope to find friends who would help block the threats of Japanese expansion. China declared war on Germany in August 1917 as a technicality to make it eligible to attend the postwar peace conference. They considered sending a token combat unit to the Western Front, but never did so.Stephen G. Craft, \\"Angling for an Invitation to Paris: China's Entry into the First World War.\\" International History Review 16#1 (1994): 1‚Äì24.Guoqi Xu, \\"The Great War and China's military expedition plan.\\" Journal of Military History 72#1 (2008): 105‚Äì140. British diplomats were afraid that the U.S. and Japan would displace Britain's leadership role in the Chinese economy. Britain sought to play Japan and the United States against each other, while at the same time maintaining cooperation among all three nations against Germany.Clarence B. Davis, \\"Limits of Effacement: Britain and the Problem of American Cooperation and Competition in China, 1915-1917.\\" Pacific Historical Review 48#1 (1979): 47‚Äì63. in JSTOR In January 1915, Japan secretly issued an ultimatum of Twenty-One Demands to the Chinese government. They included Japanese control of former German rights, 99-year leases in southern Manchuria, an interest in steel mills, and concessions regarding railways. China did have a seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. However, it was refused a return of the former German concessions and China had to accept the Twenty-One demands, although they had been softened somewhat because of pressure from the United States on Japan. A major reaction to this humiliation was a surge in Chinese nationalism expressed in the May Fourth Movement.Zhitian Luo, \\"National humiliation and national assertion-The Chinese response to the twenty-one demands\\" Modern Asian Studies (1993) 27#2 pp 297‚Äì319. =Romania= King Ferdinand (right) defies the German Kaiser in this British poster. Romania, a small rural Orthodox nation of 7,500,000 people in 54,000 square miles of territory, was neutral for the first two years of the war. It had the major oil fields in Europe, and Germany eagerly bought its petroleum, as well as food exports. King Carol favored Germany but after his death in 1914, King Ferdinand and the nation's political elite favored the Entente. For Romania, the highest priority was taking Transylvania from Hungary, thus adding ca. 5,200,000 people, 54% (according to 1910 census) or 57% (according to the 1919 and 1920 censuses) of them Romanians. The Allies wanted Romania to join its side in order to cut the rail communications between Germany and Turkey, and to cut off Germany's oil supplies. Britain made loans, France sent a military training mission, and Russia promised modern munitions. The Allies promised at least 200,000 soldiers to defend Romania against Bulgaria to the south, and help it invade Austria. In August 1916 Romania entered the war on the Allied side. The Romanian army was poorly trained, badly equipped and inadequately officered. Romania did invade Austria-Hungary, but was soon thrown back, and faced a second front when Bulgarian troops, supported by German and Ottoman forces, invaded in Dobruja. By the end of 1916, two-thirds of the country (including the capital Bucharest) were occupied by the Central Powers and only Moldavia remained free. The Allied promises proved illusory, and when Romanian oilfields were threatened, the British destroyed the Ploie»ôti oilfields to keep them out of German hands. On July 22, 1917, the Romanians launched a joint offensive with Russia against the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, around MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and the lower part of the Siret river, which resulted in the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti. Although there was some initial success, a counter-offensive by the Central Powers in Galicia stopped the Romanian-Russian offensive. The subsequent German and Austrian-Hungarian push to knock Romania out of the war was stopped at MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and Oituz by the Romanian and Russian forces. When Russia collapsed in late 1917, the Romanian cause was hopeless, and Romania had no choice but to conclude the Armistice of Foc»ôani on 9 December 1917 and in May 1918 the Treaty of Bucharest. It demobilized its surviving soldiers; nearly half the 750,000 men (335,706)Military Casualties-World War-Estimated,\\" Statistics Branch, GS, War Department, 25 February 1924; cited in World War I: People, Politics, and Power, published by Britannica Educational Publishing (2010) p. 219 it had recruited were dead, and the economy was ruined. On 10 November 1918, as the Central Powers were all surrendering, Romania again joined the Allied side. On 28 November 1918, the Romanian representatives of Bukovina voted for union with the Kingdom of Romania, followed by the proclamation of a Union of Transylvania with Romania on 1 December 1918 by the representatives of Transylvanian Romanians gathered at Alba Iulia, while the representatives of the Transylvanian Saxons approved the act on 15 December at an assembly in Media»ô. A similar gathering was held by the minority Hungarians in Cluj, on 22 December, to reaffirm their allegiance to Hungary. The Romanian control of Transylvania, which had also a minority Hungarian-speaking population of 1,662,000 (31.6%, according to the census data of 1910), was widely resented in the new nation state of Hungary. This started the Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 between Romania and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, which also waged parallel conflicts with Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The conflict with Romania ended with a partial Romanian occupation of Hungary.Glenn E.

Its location was ideal for operations in the Balkans against Austria, and against Turkey. The Allies offered tempting gains, including Greek control of southern Albania, Cyprus, and Smyrna. The Greek government was deeply divided. King Constantine I expected Germany would win, and the government of Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos expected the Allies would win. Both sides agreed that the success and expansion of Greece depended on the winner. Greece remained neutral. In 1915 Venizelos offered an alliance with the Allies with control of Constantinople its reward. Russia vetoed the Greek proposal because its main war goal was to control the Straits, and take control of Constantinople, And it had the support of the British and French.Hugh Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire, 1801-1917 (1967) pp. 706‚Äì7. Venizelos was forced to resign but parliamentary elections in June 1915 brought him back to power.1 Repeatedly, both sides violated Greek neutrality. Venizelos allowed the Allies the use of Salonika as a port to attack Bulgaria, but at this point Greece did not join the Allies. The Allied armies failed to advance beyond Salonika. In summer of 1916, the Athens government under King Constantine handed over Fort Roupel to the Germans, calling it a neutral act; it was denounced as a betrayal by the Venizelists. Allied forces fought the war from the Salonika base, engaging Bulgarian forces when they invaded Greece in August 1916 in the Battle of Struma. British and French troops landed in Athens in December 1916, hoping to overthrow the king, but failed and were forced to withdraw. The Allies then blockaded Greek areas supporting the king and finally forced his abdication in June 1917. His son became king and supported Venizelos. At long last Greece declared war on the Central Powers on 30 June 1917. There was little movement on the front until the spring of 1918 and the Greek victory at the Battle of Skra-di-Legen, followed by the Allied offensive in autumn 1918 that broke German, Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian lines.David Dutton, \\"The Deposition of King Constantine of Greece, June 1917: An Episode in Anglo-French Diplomacy.\\" Canadian Journal of History 12.3 (1978): 325‚Äì346. After the Allies were victorious, Greece expected a large slice of Turkey in the spoils, but was defeated militarily in the Greco- Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922). Britain kept Cyprus, and Greece wound up with only Western Thrace. Its most grievous legacy was profound political and social turmoil known as the \\"National Schism\\" that polarized Greece into two hostile political camps for generations.George B. Leon, Greece and the First World War: from neutrality to intervention, 1917-1918 (1990).Herbert Adams Gibbons, Venizelos (1920) A favorable biography by an American expert. onlinePaxton Hibben, Constantine I am the Greek People (1920) online American entry in 1917 American entry into the war came in April 1917, after 2¬Ω years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States neutral. =American neutrality= Americans had no inkling that a war was approaching in 1914. Over 100,000 were caught unaware when the wars started when stuck, having traveled to Europe for tourism, business or to visit relatives. Their repatriation was handled by Herbert Hoover, an American private citizen based in London. The U.S. government, under the firm control of President Wilson, was neutral. The president insisted that all government actions be neutral, and that the belligerents must respect that neutrality according to the norms of international law. Wilson told the Senate in August 1914 when the war began that the United States, \\"must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another.\\" He was ambiguous whether he meant the United States as a nation or meant all Americans as individuals. Wilson has been accused of violating his own rule of neutrality. Later that month he explained himself privately to his top foreign policy advisor Colonel House, who recalled the episode later:E. M. House, Intimate Papers of Colonel House, Vol. 1 ÃÉ1912-1915 edited by Charles Seymour, (1926) vol 1 p. 299, dated August 30, 1914 Apart from an Anglophile element supporting Britain, public opinion in 1914-1916 strongly favored neutrality. Wilson kept the economy on a peacetime basis, and made no preparations or plans for the war. He insisted on keeping the army and navy on its small peacetime bases. Indeed, Washington refused even to study the lessons of military or economic mobilization that had been learned so painfully across the sea.Keene, Jennifer D. \\"Americans Respond: Perspectives on the Global War, 1914-1917.\\" Geschichte und Gesellschaft 40.2 (2014): 266‚Äì286. online =Submarine issue= The most important indirect strategy used by the belligerents was the blockade: starve the enemy of food and the military machine will be crippled and perhaps the civilians will demand an end to the war. The Royal Navy successfully stopped the shipment of most war supplies and food to Germany. Neutral American ships that tried to trade with Germany (which international law clearly allowed), were seized or turned back. The strangulation came about very slowly, because Germany and its allies controlled extensive farmlands and raw materials, but it eventually worked because Germany and Austria took so many farmers into their armies. By 1918 the German cities were on the verge of starvation; the front-line soldiers were on short rations and were running out of essential supplies. The Allied blockade had done its job. Germany responded with its own submarine-based blockade of Britain. When the large passenger liner Lusitania was sunk in 1915 with the loss of over 100 American lives, Wilson made clear the American objection: The Lusitania sinking was the event that decisively swung American opinion; do it again and would be grounds for a declaration of war by the United States. The British frequently violated America's neutral rights by seizing ships, but they did not drown anyone.David Stevenson, The First World War and International Politics (1988) pp. 67‚Äì78. Berlin acquiesced, ordering its submarines to avoid passenger ships. But by January 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided that unrestricted submarine attacks on all American ships headed to Britain blockade was the only way it could win the war. They knew that meant war with the United States, but they gambled that they could win before America's potential strength could be mobilized. They vastly exaggerated how many ships they could sink and how much that would weaken Britain; they did not figure out that convoys would defeat their efforts. They were correct in seeing that the United States was so weak militarily that it could not be a factor on the Western Front for more than a year. The civilian government in Berlin objected to the plan, but the Kaiser sided with the military; the civilian government in Berlin was not in charge.May, The World War and American Isolation p 414 Wilson, as he made clear in his Fourteen Points of January 1918, believed that peace would never come to a world that contained aggressive, powerful, non-democratic militaristic states. Peace required a world based on free democracies. There was never a possibility for compromise between these polar situations. America had to fight for democracy, or it would be fighting perpetually against ever-stronger evil enemies (stronger because they would gobble up weak neighbors whenever they could.) =Ethnic groups = Ethnic groups in the United States became involved on both sides, putting pressure on the Wilson administration to either be neutral, or to give greater support to the Allies. Jewish Americans were hostile to Russia, but when the tsarist regime fell in February 1917, their objection to supporting the Allies fell away. When the British issued the Balfour Declaration in late 1917, which Wilson supported, Jewish support for the Allied cause surged. Irish Catholics were very hostile to supporting Great Britain, but Wilson neutralized that problem by seeming to promise the issue of Irish independence would be on his agenda after the war. He did not fulfill that promise, however, leading to furious outrage among Irish Catholics, who played a powerful role in the Democratic Party in most large cities. In 1919 they opposed the League of Nations, and in 1920 they gave lukewarm support to the Democratic presidential ticket.William M. Leary, \\"Woodrow Wilson, Irish Americans, and the Election of 1916.\\" Journal of American History 54.1 (1967): 57-72. in JSTOR German American ethnics strongly supported neutrality; very few spoke out on behalf of Germany itself. When the United States declared war, they went silent and were closely monitored for possible disloyalty. There was no actual disloyalty, but the political voice of the German-American community was greatly diminished.Edward Cuddy, \\"Pro-Germanism and American Catholicism, 1914-1917.\\" Catholic Historical Review 54.3 (1968): 427‚Äì454. Scandinavians generally favored neutrality, but like the Germans they had few spokesmen in Congress or high office. =National security= By 1916 a new factor was emerging‚Äîa sense of national self-interest and nationalism. The unbelievable casualty figures were sobering‚Äîtwo vast battles caused over one million casualties each. Clearly this war would be a decisive episode in the history of the world. Every American effort to find a peaceful solution was frustrated. Henry Ford managed to make pacifism look ridiculous by sponsoring a private peace mission that accomplished nothing. German agents added a comic opera touch. The agent in charge of propaganda left his briefcase on the train, where an alert Secret Service agent snatched it up. Wilson let the newspapers publish the contents, which indicated a systematic effort by Berlin to subsidize friendly newspapers and block British purchases of war materials. Berlin's top espionage agent, debonair Fanz Rintelen von Kleist was spending millions to finance sabotage in Canada, stir up trouble between the US and Mexico and to incite labor strikes. The British were engaged in propaganda too, though not illegal espionage. But they did not get caught; Germany took the blame as Americans grew ever more worried about the vulnerability of a free society to subversion. Indeed, one of the main fears Americans of all stations had in 1916-1919 was that spies and saboteurs were everywhere. This sentiment played a major role in arousing fear of Germany, and suspicions regarding everyone of German descent who could not \\"prove\\" 100% loyalty.Arthur S. Link, Wilson, Volume III: The Struggle for Neutrality, 1914-1915 (1960) 3:556ff Americans felt an increasing need for a military that could command respect; as one editor put it, \\"The best thing about a large army and a strong navy is that they make it so much easier to say just what we want to say in our diplomatic correspondence.\\" Berlin thus far had backed down and apologized when Washington was angry, thus boosting American self- confidence. America's rights and America's honor increasingly came into focus. The slogan \\"Peace\\" gave way to \\"Peace with Honor.\\" The Army remained unpopular, however. A recruiter in Indianapolis noted that, \\"The people here do not take the right attitude towards army life as a career, and if a man joins from here he often tries to go out on the quiet.\\" The Preparedness movement used its easy access to the mass media to demonstrate that the War Department had no plans, no equipment, little training, no reserves, a laughable National Guard, and a wholly inadequate organization for war. Motion pictures like \\"The Birth of a Nation\\" (1915) and \\"The Battle Cry of Peace\\" (1915) depicted invasions of the American homeland that demanded action.John Patrick Finnegan, Against the specter of a dragon: The campaign for American military preparedness, 1914-1917 (1974). =Decision for war= The story of American entry into the war is a study in how public opinion changed radically in three years' time. In 1914 Americans thought the war was a dreadful mistake and were determined to stay out. By 1917 the same public felt just as strongly that going to war was both necessary and morally right.Michael S. Neiberg, The Path to War: How the First World War Created Modern America (2016) pp 231-39. The generals had little to say during this debate, and purely military considerations were seldom raised. The decisive questions dealt with morality and visions of the future. The prevailing attitude was that America possessed a superior moral position as the only great nation devoted to the principles of freedom and democracy. By staying aloof from the squabbles of reactionary empires, it could preserve those ideals‚Äîsooner or later the rest of the world would come to appreciate and adopt them. In 1917 this very long-run program faced the severe danger that in the short run powerful forces adverse to democracy and freedom would triumph. Strong support for moralism came from religious leaders, women (led by Jane Addams), and from public figures like long-time Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of State from 1913 to 1916. The most important moralist of all was President Woodrow Wilson‚Äîthe man who so dominated the decision for war that the policy has been called Wilsonianism and event has been labelled \\"Wilson's War.\\"Lloyd E. Ambrosius, Wilsonianism: Woodrow Wilson and His Legacy in American Foreign Relations (2002) p 6. In 1917 Wilson, a Democrat, proved his political genius by winning the support of most of the moralists by proclaiming \\"a war to make the world safe for democracy.\\" If they truly believed in their ideals, he explained, now was the time to fight. The question then became whether Americans would fight for what they deeply believed in, and the answer turned out to be a resounding \\"YES\\".Ross Kennedy, The Will to Believe: Woodrow Wilson, World War I, and America's Strategy for Peace and Security (2009). In early 1917 Berlin forced the issue. The decision to try to sink every ship on the high seas was the immediate cause of American entry into the war. Five American merchant ships went down in March. If further evidence were needed, the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmerman, approached Mexico for an alliance; Mexico would join Germany in a war and be rewarded with the return of lost territories in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Outraged public opinion now overwhelmingly supported Wilson when he asked Congress for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917. The United States had a moral responsibility to enter the war, he proclaimed, to make the world safe for democracy. The future of the world was being determined on the battlefield, and American national interest demanded a voice. Wilson's definition of the situation won wide acclaim, and, indeed, has shaped America's role in world and military affairs ever since. Wilson saw that if Germany would win, the consequences would be bad for the United States. Germany would dominate Europe, which in turn controlled much of the world through colonies. The solution was \\"peace without victory\\" Wilson said. He meant a peace shaped by the United States along the lines of what in 1918 became Wilson's Fourteen Points.Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910‚Äì1917 (1954) pp. 262-82. =Wartime diplomacy= The United States was an affiliated partner‚Äîan \\"ally\\" in practice but not in name. The U.S. had no treaty with the Allies, but did have high level contacts. Wilson assigned Colonel House the central role in working with British officials. As soon as the US declared war Britain sent the high-level Balfour Mission, April‚ÄìMay, 1917. France sent a separate mission at the same time. Both missions were eager was to publicize the Allied cause and work on plans for wartime cooperation. Balfour met with Wilson and Colonel House to review the secret treaties which bound Britain and France to Italy and others. Members of the delegations met with many senior leaders in the national government, finance, industry and politics, to explain the British positions. Other meetings dealt with the supply of munitions and other exports, and the proposed Balfour Declaration. Britain asked for naval help against the submarine menace, but realizing the small size of the American army, did not ask for soldiers.Richard Lee Loper, The Balfour Mission: Anglo-American Diplomacy, April‚ÄìMay, 1917 (1967). Both United States and Britain had issued idealistic visions of the postwar world in January 1918. Prime Minister David Lloyd George announced the British vision on January 5, while Wilson spelled out his Fourteen Points on January 8. The Wilsonian manifesto had a major impact around the world, and especially on Germany, which by October 1918 had decided to make peace on its terms. The other Allies did not issue postwar plans, for they were focused primarily on cash reparations from Germany and specific territorial gains from Austria and Turkey. The British and American manifestoes overlapped heavily. They both specified the right of self- determination for nationalities, and the creation of a new international organization to keep the peace. However, they disagreed regarding reparations to be paid by the loser, which Wilson opposed at first. Wilson also wanted lowering of trade barriers and especially freedom of the seas, which the British could not endorse.John Grigg, Lloyd George: War Leader, 1916-1918 (2002) 379-85. Eastern and Middle-Eastern theatres of World War I Central Powers =Germany= Eastern Front While the Western Front was static, the fighting on the Eastern Front moved back and forth over hundreds of miles. There were decisive wins and defeats, led off by the military collapse of Russia after the failure of the Brusilov Offensive in 1916, and the political collapse in 1917. There were decisive victories against the Russian army, starting in 1914 the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the Battle of Tannenberg, followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces ‚Äì exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 Russian Revolution ‚Äì led to the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk the Bolsheviks were forced to sign on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war. It gave Germany control of Eastern Europe. Russia surrenders: the Treaty of Brest Litovsk The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918 between the new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia and the Central Powers. Historian Spencer Tucker says, \\"The German General Staff had formulated extraordinarily harsh terms that shocked even the German negotiator.\\" Russia gave up all claims on Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine and Lithuania. Poland was not mentioned but it was taken over by Germany. A slice of territory was ceded to Turkey. Russia agreed to pay six billion German gold marks in reparations. The treaty gave Germany multiple gains. Most important, it allowed the main forces in the East to the move to the Western front, where they outnumbered the Allies, since the Americans had not yet arrived in strength. Second and achieve the German war aims of controlling most of Eastern Europe. Third, it supposedly solved the desperate German food shortages, since Ukraine was the bread basket of Russia. As for Russia, the new Bolshevik government desperately needed to end the war with Germany to concentrate on its multiple civil wars trying to overthrow the new regime from the right. However, Ukraine was so poorly organized that very little of the promised food was actually delivered to Germany. With Russia out of the war, the diplomatic constraints it imposes on the Allied war effort ended. That is, the promises made to Russia in 1914 were. The Treaty proved to the Allies that there could be no negotiated peace with Germany and that fighting would have to continue until it surrendered. The treaty became a nullity when Germany signed the Armistice in November 1918, which was effectively its surrender to the Allies.Wolfram Dornik and Peter Lieb, \\"Misconceived realpolitik in a failing state: the political and economical fiasco of the Central Powers in the Ukraine, 1918.\\" First World War Studies 4.1 (2013): 111-124. When Germany later complained that the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 was too harsh on them, the Allies responded that it was more benign than Brest-Litovsk. Subversion of enemy states At the start of the war, Germany expanded its unofficial propaganda machinery, establishing the Central Office for Foreign Services, which among other duties was tasked with propaganda distribution to neutral nations, persuading them to either side with Germany or to maintain their stance of neutrality. After the declaration of war, Britain immediately cut the undersea telegraph cables that connected Germany to the outside world, thereby cutting off a major propaganda outlet. The Germans relied instead on the powerful wireless Nauen Transmitter Station to broadcast pro-German news reports to the world. Among other techniques used to keep up the morale of the troops, mobile cinemas were regularly dispatched to the front line for the entertainment of the troops. Newsreels would portray current events with a pro-German slant. German propaganda techniques heavily relied on emphasising the mythological and martial nature of the Germanic 'Volk' and the inevitability of its triumph.David Welch, Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914-1918: the sins of omission (Rutgers Up, 2000). In December 1917 the German Foreign Minister Richard von K√ºhlmann explained the main goals of his diplomacy was now to subvert enemy states and make peace with breakaway states and thus undermine the political unity of the Entente: :The disruption of the Entente and the subsequent creation of political combinations agreeable to us constitute the most important war aim of our diplomacy. Russia appeared to be the weakest link in the enemy chain. The task, therefore, was gradually to loosen it, and, when possible, to remove it. This was the purpose of the subversive activity we caused to be carried out in Russia behind the front--in the first place promotion of separatist tendencies and support of the Bolsheviks. It was not until the Bolsheviks had received from us a steady flow of funds through various channels and under different labels that they were in a position to be able to build up their main organ, Pravda, to conduct energetic propaganda and appreciably to extend the originally narrow basis of their party. The Bolsheviks have now come to power; how long they will retain power cannot be yet foreseen. They need peace in order to strengthen their own position; on the other hand, it is entirely in our interest that we should exploit the period while they are in power, which may be a short one, in order to attain firstly an armistice and then, if possible, peace.Z.

The goal was to convince Spain to remain neutral, which it did. =Austro-Hungarian Empire= The Austro- Hungarian Empire played a relatively passive diplomatic role in the war, as it was increasingly dominated and controlled by Germany.A. F. Pribram, Austrian Foreign Policy, 1908-18 (1923) pp. 68‚Äì128.Z.A.B. Zeman, A diplomatic history of the First World War (1971) pp 121-61. The only goal was to punish Serbia and try to stop the ethnic breakup of the Empire, and it completely failed. Instead, as the war went on the ethnic unity declined; the Allies encouraged breakaway demands from minorities and the Empire faced disintegration. Starting in late 1916 the new Emperor Charles I of Austria removed the pro- German officials and opened peace overtures to the Allies, whereby the entire war could be ended by compromise, or perhaps Austria would make a separate peace from Germany.Stevenson, The First World War and International Politics (1988) pp. 139‚Äì48. The main effort was vetoed by Italy, which had been promised large slices of Austria for joining the Allies in 1915. Austria was only willing to turn over the Trentino region but nothing more.David Stevenson, \\"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\\" Historical Journal 34#1 (1991): 65-86. Although his foreign minister, Graf Czernin, was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau published letters signed by him. This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its German ally. Emperor Charles was seen as a defeatist, which weakened his standing at home and with both the Allies and Germany.Edward P. Keleher, \\"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro- German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\\" East European Quarterly 26.2 (1992): 163+. As the Imperial economy collapsed into severe hardship and even starvation, its multi-ethnic Army lost its morale and was increasingly hard-pressed to hold its line. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and opposition parties strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. As it became apparent that the Allies would win the war, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for their majority areas, started demanding full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.Alexander Watson, Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War, 1914-1918 (2014). pp. 536‚Äì40. By summer 1918, \\"Green Cadres\\" of army deserters formed armed bands in the hills of Croatia-Slavonia and civil authority disintegrated. By late October violence and massive looting erupted and there were efforts to form peasant republics. However The Croatian political leadership was focused on creating a new state (Yugoslavia) and worked with the advancing Serbian army to impose control and end the uprisings.Ivo Banac, \\"'Emperor Karl Has Become a Comitadji': The Croatian Disturbances of Autumn 1918.\\" Slavonic and East European Review 70#2 (1992): 284‚Äì305. Alexander Watson argues that, \\"The Habsburg regime's doom was sealed when Wilson's response to the note sent two and a half weeks earlier arrived on 20 October.\\" Wilson rejected the continuation of the dual monarchy as a negotiable possibility.Watson, Ring of Steel pp 541‚Äì2 As one of his Fourteen Points, President Woodrow Wilson demanded that \\"The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous development.\\" In response, Emperor Karl I agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However the leaders of these national groups rejected the idea; they deeply distrusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.Ivo Banac, \\"'Emperor Karl Has Become a Comitadji': The Croatian Disturbances of Autumn 1918.\\" Slavonic and East European Review 70#2 (1992): 284‚Äì305 in JSTOR. Czech units in Austria in May 1918 was brutally suppressed. It was punished as mutiny. On 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister Baron Istv√°n Buri√°n von Rajecz asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Emperor Karl issued a proclamation (\\"Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918\\") two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of Galicia and Lodomeria were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of Cisleithania was to be transformed into a federal union composed of four parts‚ÄîGerman, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna and Trieste was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain their rule. Karl's proposal was a dead letter when on 18 October U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities was no longer enough. Karl's last Hungarian prime minister, Mih√°ly K√°rolyi, terminated the personal union with Austria on 31 October, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. By the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Karl's authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council.Watson, Ring of Steel pp 542‚Äì56Z.A.B. Zeman, The Break-up of the Habsburg Empire: 1914-1918 (1961). =Ottoman Empire (Turkey) = A German postcard of the Ottoman Navy early in the war. The caption reads \\"Turkey gets going\\". The portrait shows Sultan Mehmed V. The Ottoman Empire in 1914 had a population of about 25 million including 14 million Turks and large numbers of Arabs, Armenians, Greeks, and other minorities. It had lost almost all of its holdings in Europe and North Africa in a series of wars, most recently in 1912. The economy was heavily traditional, but with a strong German influence in terms of modernization, especially building railways. In 1914 the Ottoman government in Constantinople took the initiative in supporting the Central Powers. see Ottoman‚ÄìGerman alliance Its Army already was under German guidance, especially by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The British expected the alliance with Germany and seized two dreadnoughts under construction that had been paid for by the Ottomans. Negotiations with the Allies went nowhere after the Turks demanded very large concessions. Instead, a secret alliance was made with Germany in early August, with promises of regaining territory lost to Russia, Greece and Serbia in earlier wars. in the Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau two German warships fled to Constantinople for safety at the start of the war. Despite their German crews, they were officially enrolled in the Turkish Navy and followed the Sultan's orders. They attacked Russian ports on the Black Sea in October 1914; that led in a few days to mutual declarations of war. German General Erich Ludendorff stated in his memoirs that he believed the entry of the Turks into the war allowed the outnumbered Central powers to fight on for two years longer than they would have been able on their own, a view shared by historian Ian F.W. Beckett.Ian Beckett, \\"Turkey's Momentous Moment\\" HistoryToday 63#6 (2013) The Turks fought the war on multiple fronts: against Russia on the Black Sea and eastern Turkey and the Russian Caucasus; against Britain in Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Sinai and Palestine in 1917; and against the combined Allies at Gallipoli, near the approaches to Constantinople. Their great victory was at Gallipoli. Troop movements were extremely difficult because of the heavy inadequate and uncompleted railway system. The British engaged in secret peace talks with Ottoman representatives in Switzerland in 1917-1918, on the basis of autonomy for the non-Turkish areas. The Turkish leadership was internally divided and could not agree on any peace terms. The British wanted to wait until they conquered more Ottoman territory. No agreement was reached. The Arab Revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, and set the partition of the Ottoman Empire under the terms of the Treaty of S√®vres. This treaty, as designed in the conference of London, allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The occupation of Constantinople and ƒ∞zmir led to the establishment of a Turkish national movement, which won the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì23) under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (later given the surname \\"Atat√ºrk\\"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned 1918‚Äì22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The caliphate was abolished on 3 March 1924. The Armenian Genocide was the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of its Armenian subjects. The number of dead reached perhaps 1.5 million. Armenian Genocide The Armenian Genocide was the deliberate decision of Ottoman officials to remove Armenians from Eastern Turkey, in a way that killed upwards of a million or more fleeing civilians.Jo Laycock, \\"Beyond National Narratives? Centenary Histories, the First World War and the Armenian Genocide Armenian Genocide.\\" Revolutionary Russia 28.2 (2015): 93-117.For studies from scholars of the Ottoman Empire, see David Gutman, \\"Ottoman Historiography and the End of the Genocide Taboo: Writing the Armenian Genocide into Late Ottoman History.\\" Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association 2:1 (2015) pp 167-183. online In 1915, as the Russian Caucasus Army continued to advance into its eastern provinces the Ottoman government started the deportation of its ethnic Armenian population. The genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.Taner Akcam, The Young Turks' Crime against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire (Princeton UP, 2013) online The diplomatic dimension considered here was the diplomatic response of Allied powers. Ottoman officials denied any massacre, and their German allies helped cover for them. Allied governments tried diplomacy to stop the genocide but were ignored.Thomas Schmutz, \\"Reacting to Violence: The Diplomatic Context of the Armenian Question and the Armenian Genocide (1913‚Äì1917).\\" Australian Journal of Politics & History 62.4 (2016): 501-513. On 24 May 1915 the Allies issued a joint public denunciation of the ‚Äúmass murders‚Äù of the Armenians, denouncing a new \\"crime against humanity and civilization,\\" for which all guilty parties would be held personally responsible after the war. The victors brought the matter to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. It did not follow- up. The new Ottoman government did put some high officials on trial, punishing some‚Äîand executed a few. They condemned to death in absentia the top leaders, but these men had fled and were in hiding. However, Armenians did track down the interior minister Talaat Pasha and assassinated him in 1921 in Berlin. The Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 gave amnesty to the rest of the perpetrators. The United States never declared war on Turkey, and did not join the condemnation of crimes against humanity, despite the urgent pleadings of the American ambassador to Constantinople, Henry Morgenthau Sr..Samantha Power, \\"A Problem from Hell\\": America and the Age of Genocide (2002), pp. 1‚Äì12. =Bulgaria= A German postcard welcoming the entry of Bulgaria into the war and showing Bulgaria's Tsar Ferdinand In the aftermath of its defeat and limited territorial gains in the Balkan Wars, Bulgaria felt betrayed and turned against its former ally Russia. Bulgaria in 1914‚Äì15 was neutral. In 1915 Germany and Austria realized they needed Bulgaria's help in order to defeat Serbia militarily thereby opening supply lines from Germany to Turkey and bolstering the Eastern Front against Russia. In return for war, Bulgaria insisted on major territorial gains, especially Macedonia, which Austria was reluctant to grant until Berlin insisted. Bulgaria also negotiated with the Allies, who offered less generous terms. In 1915 the government of liberal prime minister Vasil Radoslavov therefore aligned Bulgaria with the Central Powers even though this meant becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional political and religious enemy. While Bulgaria now had no land claims against the Ottomans, it resented Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) for seizing lands the Bulgarians decided belonged to them. Bulgaria signed an alliance with Germany and Austria in September 1915 that envisioned that Bulgaria would dominate the Balkans after victory in the war.Charles Jelavich and Barbara Jelavich, The Establishment of the Balkan National States, 1804‚Äì1920 (1977) pp 289‚Äì90Richard C. Hall, \\"Bulgaria in the First World War,\\" Historian, (2011) 73#2 pp 300‚Äì315 Although the Bulgarian army was militarily successful in 1915-1917, its effectiveness collapsed in the summer of 1918. Morale was bad because of shortages of food at home, the munitions at the front. Both at the leadership in the popular level, there was a growing distrust of Germany intentions. War weariness was prevalent, and soldiers felt betrayed. Many resented having to fight their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The leadership lost the support of the Bulgarian people. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 crystallized the resentments in Bulgaria, spreading anti-war and anti- monarchist sentiment. In June 1918 Radoslavov's government resigned. In September, 1918, the Allies invaded with 29 divisions and 700,000 troops. Bulgaria was quickly overrun and agreed to an armistice. Tsar Ferdinand abdicated, mutinies ravaged the army, and a republic was proclaimed. The Ottoman Empire now became disconnected from Germany and Austria and it too soon collapsed. On November 8, Bulgaria reentered the war on the Allied side. However it was too late: a year later the allies imposed very harsh Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine that stripped away more territory. Germany had loaned Bulgaria the money to fund the war; that debt was cancelled at Paris but the Allies imposed a ¬£100 million reparations debt that the impoverished nation could not pay.Richard C. Hall, \\"'The Enemy is Behind Us': The Morale Crisis in the Bulgarian Army during the Summer of 1918,\\" War in History 11#2 pp. 209‚Äì219. New nations = Poland= Poland for a century had been split between Russia, Austria, and Germany. It was the scene of numerous battles, most of which were defeats for Russia. Historian M. B. Biskupski argues that Poles tried to influence international diplomacy in several ways. In 1914‚Äì1916, they appealed to popular sympathy for the plight of suffering civilians, and forced onto the agenda the \\"Polish Question\\" (that is, creating an independent Poland). Efforts to bring food relief failed. Both sides needed Polish soldiers, and had to make promises to get them. In 1918, Polish independence was promoted by both sides as proof of their morally superior vision for the postwar world.Mieczyslaw B. Biskupski, \\"War and the Diplomacy of Polish Independence, 1914‚Äì18.\\" Polish Review (1990): 5‚Äì17. online Polish nationalists gained political leverage when offered promises of concessions and future autonomy in exchange for Polish loyalty and army recruits. Russia recognized Polish autonomy and allowed formation of the Polish National Committee, which supported the Allied side. Russia's foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov proposed to create an autonomous Kingdom of Poland with its own internal administration, religious freedom and Polish language used in schools and administration;R.F. Leslie, ed. The history of Poland since 1863 (Cambridge UP, 1983) p 98 Roman Dmowski tried to persuade the Allies to unify the Polish lands under Russian rule as an initial step toward independence.Norman Davies, God's Playground A History of Poland: Volume II: 1795 to the Present (2005) pp. 279‚Äì95. Meanwhile, in Germany J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski formed the Polish Legions to assist the Central Powers in defeating Russia as the first step toward full independence for Poland. Berlin voguely proposed creation of puppet state, called Kingdom of Poland (1917‚Äì18), while planning to ethnically cleanse millions of Poles to make room for German colonists in Polish Border Strip plan. When the Bolsheviks took power in late 1917, they effectively surrendered control of Eastern Europe to the Germans. The Allies were now free of promises to Russia, and the entry of the United States into the war enabled President Wilson to transform the war into a crusade to spread democracy and liberate the Poles.Christopher G. Salisbury, \\"For Your Freedom and Ours: The Polish Question in Wilson's Peace Initiatives, 1916‚Äê1917.\\" Australian Journal of Politics & History 49.4 (2003): 481-500. The thirteenth of his Fourteen Points adopted the resurrection of Poland as one of the main aims of the war. Polish opinion crystallized in support of the Allied cause. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Rejected the Germans. In October 1918, Poles took control of Galicia and Cieszyn Silesia. In November 1918, Pi≈Çsudski returned to Warsaw. and took control over the newly created state as its provisional Chief of State. Soon all the local governments that had been created in the last months of the war pledged allegiance to the central government in Warsaw. Poland now controlled Privislinsky Krai, western Galicia (with Lw√≥w besieged by the Ukrainians) and part of Cieszyn Silesia. = Ukraine= Unlike Poland, Ukraine did not have the world's attention. There were few Ukrainians living in the United States and Wilson largely ignored the issues.Wolodymyr Stojko, \\"The Attitude Of The United States Towards Ukrainian Statehood, 1917-1920\\" Ukrainian Quarterly (2001) 57#3 pp. 209‚Äì223. The Ukrainians in exile nevertheless managed to overcome bitter internal disputes, and set up a Ukrainian National Rada and, after several schisms, a Ukrainian national Committee. It sent representatives to the Peace Conference in Paris and carried on much relief and informational work. The most active lobbying work dealt with the Ottoman Empire, but it was in no position to play a major role.Clarence A. Manning, \\"The Ukrainians and the United States in World War I,\\" Ukrainian Quarterly 13 (1957) pp. 346‚Äì354 The Ukraine National Republic proclaimed its independence on 22 January 1918. It was recognized by Russia, Great Britain and France, it sent delegates to Brest-Litovsk to claim recognition from Germany and the Central Powers, who granted this in February 1918. From its inception independent Ukraine had only a tenuous existence as it was intrinsically unstable, never in full control of its territory, and threatened by enemies from without and within.Vladyslav Verstiuk, \\"Conceptual Issues in Studying the History of the Ukrainian Revolution.\\" Journal of Ukrainian Studies 24.1 (1999): 5-20. Historian Orest Subtelny outlines the confused situation: : In 1919 total chaos engulfed Ukraine. Indeed, in the modern history of Europe no country experienced such complete anarchy, bitter civil strife, and total collapse of authority as did Ukraine at this time. Six different armies-‚Äì those of the Ukrainians, the Bolsheviks, the Whites, the Entente [French], the Poles and the anarchists ‚Äì operated on its territory. Kiev changed hands five times in less than a year. Cities and regions were cut off from each other by the numerous fronts. Communications with the outside world broke down almost completely. The starving cities emptied as people moved into the countryside in their search for food. Britain saw Ukraine as a German puppet during the war. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, British prime minister David Lloyd George called Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura (1874-1926) an adventurer and dismissed his legitimacy.Natalya Yakovenko, \\"Ukraine in British Strategies and Concepts of Foreign Policy, 1917-1922 and After,\\" East European Quarterly (2002) 36#4 pp. 465‚Äì79. By 1922 Poland took control of western Ukraine, and Bolshevik Russia took control of eastern Ukraine. Baltic region with railroads and main roads = Three Baltic states= The Baltic region from Lithuania in the south, Latvia in the center and Estonia in the north were parts of the Russian Empire. A sense of nationalism emerged after the revolution of 1905 and February 1917 in Russia. By October 1917, the demand had moved from autonomy to independence. In 1915‚Äì17, Germany invaded from South to North and imposed military rule. Great armies marched back and forth--Riga, Latvia went through seven regime changes. Across the three states there were attacks on civilians, deportations, scorched earth campaigns, and concentration camps. Hundreds of thousands of people fled as refugees in Russia as far away as Vladivostok in eastern Siberia.Aldis Purs, \\"Working towards 'an unforeseen miracle' redux: Latvian refugees in Vladivostok, 1918‚Äì1920, and in Latvia, 1943‚Äì1944.\\" Contemporary European History 16#4 (2007): 479-494. Local nationalists and Bolsheviks tried repeatedly to take control in the chaos. Bolsheviks controlled Latvia as the Iskolat regime and as the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1917 until they were driven out in May 1919. Bolsheviks also controlled Estonia until forced out by the Germans in early 1918. The Red Army of Soviet Russia invaded all three states in December 1918 to January 1919. However they were driven out by August 1919 by local forces aided by Finland. Peace treaties between the Soviets and the three Baltic states were finalized in 1920, and they remained independent until 1940.Alan Palmer, The Baltic: A new history of the region and its people (New York: Overlook Press, 2006; published in London with the title Northern shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples (John Murray, 2006). ch 21‚Äì22, pp. 252‚Äì92.Dovile O. Vilkauskaite, \\"From Empire to Independence: The Curious Case of the Baltic States 1917-1922.\\" (thesis, University of Connecticut, 2013). online A portion of southern Lithuania around Vilnius became the Republic of Central Lithuania in 1920-1922. It was a puppet state controlled by Poland, and was absorbed into Poland in 1922. Poland's seizure of Vilnius made normal relations with Lithuania impossible.Timothy Snyder, The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569‚Äì1999 (2003), p. 64; =Czechoslovakia= A Czechoslovak provisional government had joined the Allies on 14 October 1917. The South Slavs in both halves of the monarchy had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 Corfu Declaration signed by members of the Yugoslav Committee, and the Croatians had begun disregarding orders from Budapest earlier in October.Brent Mueggenberg, The Czecho-Slovak Struggle for Independence, 1914‚Äì1920 (2014). The American rejection of Emperor Karl's last-minute proposal for a federal union was the death certificate of Austria-Hungary.Z.A.B. Zeman, The Break-up of the Habsburg Empire: 1914-1918 (1961). The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later celebrated as the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in Martin. On the 29th of October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of Austria-Hungary proclaimed the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. They also declared their ultimate intention was to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in a large South Slav state that in 1929 was renamed Yugoslavia.. On the same day, the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state.

Kakhaber Gurieli was a son and successor of Mamia Gurieli and, like his predecessor, was involved in the final stages of a civil war that brought about the dissolution of the Kingdom of Georgia. This conflict, climaxing in the 1460s, pitted King George VIII of Georgia against the local rulers such as Bagrat II of Imereti and Qvarqvare II Jaqeli, Prince of Samtskhe. Kakhaber rendered his support to both of these. In reward, Qvarqvare ceded his rights in the provinces of Adjara and Chaneti to Gurieli, who conquered these lands by force of arms, decimating or expelling those nobles who remained loyal to the king of Georgia. Kakhaber's relations with Bagrat of Imereti, the newly crowned king in western Georgia, became soured over Gurieli's efforts to foster his autonomy and his support to the rebellion of his cousin Vameq II Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. After Bagrat's death in 1478, Kakhaber and Vameq refused to acknowledge the late king's successor Alexander II and aided the rival monarch, Constantine II of Kartli, in taking hold of Imereti in 1479. Kakhaber died in 1483. He was succeeded by Giorgi I Gurieli, his only known son by the marriage with Ana, who is known from an icon inscription from the Shemokmedi Monastery.

This location is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Georgia - Wilkes County\\". National Register of Historic Places. Retrieved April 4, 2017. BTRLS is a member of PINES, a program of the Georgia Public Library Service that serves of Georgia.

This program offers residents in supported libraries access to over 100 databases indexing thousands of periodicals and scholarly journals. It also boasts over 10,000 journal titles in full text. Namesake William Bartram Trail, for which the library is named. The namesake for the library system is William Bartram, a well-known American naturalist whose prominence in the area resulted from his four-year journey in the late 1700s through many of the southern colonies as he identified and discovered various flora and fauna. Also named after him, the Bartram Trail passes through the current communities that are part of the library system. While Bartram was in east Georgia he is recorded to have stayed in the present-day communities of Mary Willis, Taliaferro, and Thomson-McDuffie during his expeditions for his Elements of Botany Engravings. These communities are presently serviced by the Bartram Trail Regional Library System. History The first libraries to lay the groundwork for what would become the Bartram Trail Regional Library System were the Mary Willis Library and the Taliaferro County Library. In 1967 these two individual libraries signed a contractual agreement to form what was known as the Wilkes-Taliaferro Regional Library System. Three years into this agreement, in 1970, Greene County, Georgia joined the system and lengthened the name to the Wilkes-Taliaferro-Greene Regional System. By 1974, with the incorporation of McDuffie County, the library system voted to shorten its name to its current form and create a Wilkes County Library Board in order to oversee the daily operations of their newly grown library system. With an increase in interest for the library, and an ever-growing need for more space, the next decade came with many improvements to the individual buildings. In 1977 the Mary Willis Library opened an annex creating an addition 4,459 square feet of space. In 1980 the McDuffie County Library moved to the newly renovated U.S. Post Office. In 1985 the Green County Library constructed a new building with 8,600 square feet of space. In 1987 the Thomson-McDuffie County Library replaced the old county library granting 13,500 square feet. The last county to construct a new building was Taliaferro County, which opened their new library in 1989. Two years later another addition was added to the Mary Willis Library to add more space for book stacks and meeting rooms. In 1992 Greene County withdrew from the Bartram Trail Regional Library System to join the Uncle Remus Regional Library System to the west. Branches =Mary Willis Library= Entrance to the Mary Willis Library annex (Added in 1989). The Mary Willis Library was the first free public library in the state of Georgia when it opened in 1889. The free library was a revolutionary concept in a day when all the state's earlier libraries charged users a subscription fee.\\"Mary Willis Library\\". The Historical Marker Database. Retrieved April 4, 2017. The library was founded the previous year by Dr. Francis T. Willis in memory of his daughter, Mary. Dr. Willis, a local by birth who had moved to Richmond, Virginia in 1867, left the library as a gift to his hometown and its citizens. Dr. Willis donated his own private collection of books, plus fifteen thousand dollars for the library's construction, two thousand dollars to purchase furnishings and more books, and another ten thousand dollars as an endowment fund. In addition to its current collection of library materials, the Mary Willis Library owns a large and invaluable collection of Wilkes County and other greater Georgia history, including books published by local authors, family memorabilia, and Washington newspapers. The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The Mary Willis Library serves Wilkes County in Northeast Georgia, a land area of 470 square miles and a population estimated by the office of planning and budgets to be 10,560. =Taliaferro County Library= The first building that served as the Talioferro County Library was created in 1916 by businessman John Holden \\"for use of the 'Ladies of Crawfordville.'\\" Upon Holden's death in 1936 the ownership of the library turned over to the town of Crawfordville and was reassigned to public use. In 1969 the Taliaferro and Wilkes County libraries began the first iteration of a library system in the region. By 1989 the library moved from the original Holden building to a newly constructed brick building a half block away. The increase in space allowed for the creation of meeting rooms as well as the addition of computer capabilities into the present day. The Taliaferro County Library serves a land area of 195.5 square miles and a population estimated by the office of planning and budgets to be 1,921. =Thomson-McDuffie County Library= The Thomson-McDuffie County Library was first constructed in 1937, and was originally known as the Thomson Community Library. Like the Taliferro Library, the Thomson library was kept and housed by the Woman's Club in McDuffie County. In 1974 the Thomson Community Library joined the Bartram Trail Regional Library System. By 1980 in need of more space it moved to the old U.S. Post Office, but by 1987 required yet another building to house its growing collection. A new building was constructed at 338 Main Street in Thomson, Georgia and renamed the Thomson- McDuffie County Library to acknowledge the help the City of Thomson provided for the library's operation. The Thomson-McDuffie County Library serves McDuffie County in Northeast Georgia, a land area of 256 square miles and a population estimated by the office of planning and budgets to be 22,209.

It was built in 1936‚Äì37 as a Works Progress Administration project and operated as a school until 1975. It is now part of the National Hispanic Cultural Center. The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History West San Jose School was built in 1936‚Äì7 by the now-defunct Bernalillo County school district. The existing school in the area, South Second Street, was a converted church with only three classrooms and was in a bad location adjacent to the railyard. Due to the inadequacy of this facility, many of the neighborhood students had been forced to attend the similarly crowded Barelas School, or the East San Jose School (the latter requiring a dangerous railroad crossing). The county superintendent, Margaret Easterday, wanted to replace the Barelas and South Second Street schools with a large new facility, but had only $2,500 available for the project. with Nevertheless, the district purchased land for a new school in February 1936. Easterday initially planned to build a small two-room school as a stopgap measure, expanding it when funds allowed. However, this turned out to be unnecessary thanks to the unprecedented public works funding available from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. With assistance from Governor Clyde Tingley, the school district was able to secure a grant of $53,000 from the Works Progress Administration to build the school. The construction project, using adobe bricks and traditional building methods, lasted ten months and employed 70 workers. The school opened to students in the fall of 1937, after which the South Second Street and Barelas schools were closed. In 1949, West San Jose was absorbed into Albuquerque Public Schools along with the rest of the county system. In the late 1950s the name was changed to Riverview Elementary. Both Riverview and the nearby Coronado Elementary were closed in 1975 when a new school, Dolores Gonzales, was built. In 1977 the unused school was converted into a job skills center under the control of the Technical Vocational Institute (now Central New Mexico Community College). The school was renovated in the early 2000s and now houses the library and archives of the National Hispanic Cultural Center. Architecture West San Jose School is a one-story adobe building designed in the Pueblo Revival style by local architect Louis G. Hesselden. The floorplan is H-shaped with projecting wings on either side of a central block. The roofline is stepped, with a curved parapet above the projecting main entry, and the walls are stuccoed and buttressed at the corners. The classrooms are illuminated by large 9/9 sash windows, with smaller 4/4 and 2/2 windows elsewhere. The entrances to the building have double doors with transoms and sidelights.

From his days as a boy soprano, he had a successful career on the London stage, interrupted only by the aftermath of an underage wedding to a colleague. Early life Born at Coventry around 1738, Vernon was illegitimate. He studied in London under William Savage in the choir of St Paul's Cathedral. As a boy he had a fine soprano voice, and on 23 February 1751 he sang at Drury Lane Theatre in Thomas Arne's Alfred. On 22 May he took part in Queen Mab, the pantomime by Henry Woodward; on 20 September in the funeral procession in Romeo and Juliet; and on 19 November in The Shepherd's Lottery, an opera by William Boyce. In the early part of 1754 he sang tenor parts and acted comedy at Drury Lane., Scandal and exile in Dublin In 1755 Vernon married Jane Poitier, a singer at Drury Lane at the Savoy Chapel. John Wilkinson, the incumbent of the Savoy Chapel, thought that the terms of the Marriage Act 1753, aimed at clandestine marriages, did not apply to his extra-parochial church, and continued to issue licenses and to solemnise marriages. Among these technically irregular weddings, Vernon's happened to be the test case taken to court by the authorities. According to Tate Wilkinson Joseph and Jane, who had been acting as \\"Mrs. Vernon\\", were happy enough to be parted. On the other hand, the fallout of the prosecution case against the clergy of the Chapel was serious. Wilkinson was sentenced in 1756 to 14 years transportation to British North America, and died in 1757 on the way. The curate John Grierson, who had carried out the marriage, received the same sentence: Vernon had testified at the trial, and was then hissed on stage. The unpopular Vernon moved to Dublin, where he had further success as an actor. Return to Drury Lane Back at Drury Lane in 1762, Vernon was given parts by David Garrick. He combined polished singing and a natural style of acting in Shakespeare.Roles included Amiens, Lorenzo, Balthazar, Ferdinand, Thurio, Autolycus, Clown in Twelfth Night, and Roderigo. He was also assigned some characters in comedy and farce: Colonel Bully in The Provoked Wife; Master Stephen in Every Man in his Humour; Sir John Loverule in The Devil to Pay, a ballad opera by Charles Coffey, and Sharp in The Lying Valet by Garrick. According to James Boaden, Vernon's voice in maturity was of poor quality. Nonetheless, he continued to take singing parts in opera and interludes.He sang Macheath in The Beggar's Opera, and Principal Witch in The Witches. He had parts in Pharnaces by William Bates (1765); Thomas Arne's Cymon, 1767; and in The Padlock, Love in a Village, Ode to Shakespeare, The Jubilee, 1769; Lionel and Clarissa, and King Arthur, 1770; Christmas Tale, 1773; The Deserter, 1774; Black-a-moor washed White (with Sarah Siddons), Rival Candidates, 1776; and many others. The song in Act III of The School for Scandal was written by Thomas Linley for him. He took the title role in Selima and Azor, Linley's first opera. Last years Vernon's last performances were Artabanes in Artaxerxes, First Bacchanal in Comus, and Truemore in The Lord of the Manor by Jackson of Exeter, 1780. Until 6 October 1781 he appeared in these and his older parts. He died on 19 March 1782 at Lambeth, and the administration of his effects was granted to Margaret Vernon, his widow. Works Vernon compiled around 1782 The New London and Country Songster, or a Banquet of Vocal Music. He composed songs and ballads, including New Songs in the Pantomime of the Witches, the epilogue in Twelfth Night, and a song in the Two Gentlemen of Verona.

Background Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states thatThe Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11, s 11 Prior to this ruling, a contextual framework set out in R v MorinR v Jordan, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771. was used. Barrett Richard Jordan was arrested in December 2008 and charged with various offences relating to possession and trafficking. He was released with restrictive bail conditions in February 2009. The preliminary inquiry was set to occur in May 2010, but there was not enough time for the Crown to present all its evidence, so further dates were set throughout 2010 and 2011. In May 2011, Jordan was committed to stand trial. The trial lasted from September to February 2013, bringing the total delay between the charges and the conclusion of the trial to 49.5 months, of which 5.5 were imputable to the accused. During his initial trial, Jordan brought an application for stay of proceedings under section 11(b), which was dismissed. His appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia was dismissed because it was judged Jordan had not suffered significant prejudice as required by the framework.R v Jordan, 2012 BCSC 1735 His appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was also rejected.R v Jordan, 2014 BCCA 241 Ruling Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Brown JJ., speaking for the majority, found that the framework set out in R v Morin caused significant complications and contributed to a culture of delay and complacency. They pointed out that the application of the framework was unpredictable, relied on the notion of prejudice, which is \\"confusing, hard to prove, and highly subjective\\", didn't encourage the courts and parties to prevent delays, and was unduly complex. They proposed a new framework, based on a ceiling beyond which delay is presumptively unreasonable: 18 months for cases tried in provincial courts without preliminary inquiry, and 30 months for cases tried in provincial courts after a preliminary inquiry or in superior courts. Delays attributable to the defence are however subtracted from the ceiling (ex.: requesting unnecessary postponements, or an insufficient effort to accommodate the scheduling of court appearances), so an accused cannot slow the judicial process to their advantage. Since the delay in trying Jordan had been of 49.5 months, of which 44 were imputable to the Crown or to systemic delays, his appeal was allowed and a stay of proceedings was entered. Concurrence Cromwell J. considered that a stay of proceedings for Jordan should be entered under the R v Morin framework, and that the proposed new framework was not desirable. He wrote that: Aftermath The ruling had serious immediate consequences, as many persons who had already experienced delays exceeding the presumptive ceiling saw charges against them being dropped. It forced the Crown to change the way it works, including using the direct indictment procedure more frequently. This case decision ruling is informally known as the \\"Jordan decision,\\" \\"Jordan ruling,\\" or \\"Jordan rule.\\" References External links * *R. v. Morin.

The village is also well known for its traditional gi√≤ l·ª•a and the ancient village gate. The people of Uoc Le village have been going to set up their careers throughout the country, and also foreign countries to maintain the traditional career that previous generations descended to next generations. Every year, on January, 15th according to the lunar calendar, everybody, who from many places, come back village to go visit ancestral graves as well as participate in the village festival. The festival is held to honor the tutelary genius of village and ancestors of Gio Cha career. There are two national historical monuments in the village are the ancient village gate and So temple. The village gate The gate of Uoc Le village was built in the Mac Dynasty, one of the most ancient and the most beautiful gates, which is remained, in the west of Hanoi up to now. The gate is located at the beginning of the village occupying a large space with a bridge, archways and large brick walls. The shape of gate is similar to a trapezoid with a height of 6 meters and a width of 12 meters, built in red-hot bricks. In front of the gate is a curved bridge with a width of 2 meters and a length of 10 meters, which crosses a wide ditch. In the past, this ditch is a deep trench around the village with green bamboos on the edge of village, which create a strong deep fence for fighting against bandits and dangerous animals. Later, the residents opened more convenient paths for business. On the gate, there is a hanging letter with four letters \\"My Tuc Kha Phong\\", which means that \\"Fine Customs Is Bestowed\\". According to previous generations, on the northern trip of King Tu Duc (1829‚Äì1883) in the 33rd Tu Duc year (1880), King Tu Duc granted the title \\"My Tuc Kha Phong\\" to the six villages including Uoc Le village. During war, the French often used canons to destroy village, and the gate was collapsed with broken hanging letter. After that situation, the villagers took the hanging letter into storage. However, in a serious flood, the villagers had to take everything to fend for themselves, and some people did not know the meaning of the hanging letter, and took it to fend off the flood entering the gate. In the result, the fierce water swept away the original hanging letter. After finishing war, the villagers restored the gate, and asked the Han Nom Institute to take a sample of the hanging letter which was retained of another village, then remade a new hanging letter like the origin. Gio Cha Gio Cha is traditional foods of Vietnam, and Gio Cha is indispensable foods during the Tet holiday in Vietnam. According to artisan Duc Binh Nguyen, a gio cha maker in a long time, Gio Cha are making in Uoc Le village around 500 years ago. Historic records in village says that a concubine from palace, who was a villager, came back to build gate and teach the villagers how to make Gio Cha in the Mac Dynasty. Under feudalism, the dish was very noble, so the meal had Gio Cha was only for rich people. In the subsidy period, Gio Cha was being prohibited goods because it became more and more expensive. However, people of Uoc Le still remain and maintain this traditional job, which ancestors descend to them until now. The elements that make up the Gio Cha Uoc Le brand is not only the deliciousness, safety, but also the creative tinkering of people to make this dish more and more delicious. In the past, Gio Cha was made by hand, and the makers kept the secret methods of pounding meat so that the meat is plastic and not sticky to the pestle. By the 1990s, people turned into using machines instead of using pestle. Despite of it, the makers also retained the tradition way of ancestors while packaging. Gio Cha was wrapped in large banana leaves unlike the packaging in different places using aluminum tubes. Boiling Gio Cha is required high skills and meticulousness. After the water is boiled, Gio Cha is let into pot and boiled for about one hour. After completing, the makers pick it out, and drop into the cold water immediately. In the end, Gio Cha is made, and the eaters can cut into pieces with different shapes for decorating and enjoying it.

In 1981 he showed very promising form in Ireland, winning the Anglesey Stakes and finishing third in the Railway Stakes. In the following year he won the McCairns Trial Stakes on his seasonal debut and then rebounded from an unplaced effort in the 2000 Guineas to record impressive victories in the Irish 2000 Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes. He was then affected by illness and ran poorly in his three remaining races. After standing as a breeding stallion in Ireland he was exported to Czechoslovakia where he died in 2005. Background Dara Monarch was a \\"neat, attractive\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in England by Neville Bycroft. As a young horse he was twice sold at auction, making 6,400 guineas as a foal but only 5,000 guineas as a yearling. On the second occasion he was bought by the bloodstock agent Peter Doyle on behalf of the trainer Liam Browne. During his track career the colt was trained by Browne at the Curragh and raced in the colours of Browne's wife. He was sired by Realm, a British stallion who competed in sprint races and recorded his biggest win in the 1971 July Cup. He was based in Europe in his early stud career before being exported to Japan in 1979. The stamina element in Dara Monarch's pedigree was provided by his dam Sardara who was a winner over two miles and a half-sister to the St Leger winner Intermezzo. Racing career =1981: two-year-old season= Dara Monarch was unplaced over six furlongs on his debut and then finished second in a race over seven furlongs. Despite his two defeats he was then moved up in class for the Group Three Anglesey Stakes over si and a half furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse in August. Starting a 66/1 outsider he recorded his first success as he won by a length from the Vincent O'Brien- trained favourite Americus. Later that month in the Railway Stakes over the same course and distance he finished strongly to take third place behind Anfield and the Norfolk Stakes winner Day Is Done. On his final appearance of the year he was stepped up in distance for the Ashford Castle Stakes over one mile in September, but ran poorly and finished last of the eleven runners behind Anfield. =1982: three-year-old season= Dara Monarch began his second campaign in the McCairns Trial Stakes over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse and won by a length from Senior Citizen. The colt then faced a steep ascent in class when he was sent to England for the 2000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 May. Starting at odds of 33/1 he tracked the leaders for most of the way he tired in the final furlong and finished eighth of the 25 runners behind the French-trained Zino who defeated Wind and Wuthering in a photo-finish. Mick Kinane took the ride when the colt lined up for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh two weeks later. Wind and Wuthering started favourite ahead of Cajun and Raconteur with Dara Monarch going off at 20/1 in a fourteen-runner field. The other contenders included Tender King (third in the 2000 Guineas), Anfield, Achieved (Phoenix Stakes), Full Extent (Gimcrack Stakes) and Red Sunset (Coventry Stakes). In a change of tactics, Dara Monarch was restrained towards the rear of the field before making his challenge on the outside in the last quarter mile. He accelerated into the lead a furlong out and drew away from his rivals to win by three lengths from Tender King. In June Dara Monarch ran for the second time in Englan when he contested the St James's Palace Stakes (then a Group Two race) at Royal Ascot. The Henry Cecil-trained Ivano started 2/1 favourite, not so much because of his wins in the Feilden Stakes and Dee Stakes, but because of his reportedly outstanding performances on the training gallops. Dara Monarch was the 7/2 second choice, with the other seven runners including his old rivals Wind and Wuthering, Tender King, Anfield, Red Sunset and Achieved. Wind and Wuthering set the pace before giving was to Red Sunset in the straight but Dara Monarch, having been held up by Kinane in the early stages quickened on the outside to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish. He established a clear advantage and, despite hanging sharply to the right in the closing stages, held off Tender King to win by one and a half lengths with six lengths back to Ivano in third. Timeform described his performance as \\"exhilarating\\". After the race Dara Monarch was sold as a prospective stallion to the breeder Tim Rogers. The colt contacted a viral infection and was off the course for two and a half months returning in the Waterford Crystal Mile at Goodwood Racecourse when he finished last of the eight runners behind Sandhurst Prince. He failed to recapture his form in his two subsequent races, finishing fourth to Buzzards Bay in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in September and fifth behind Pas de Seul when sent to France to contest the Prix de la For√™t at Longchamp Racecourseon 24 October. Assessment In the Irish Free Handicap for the two-year-olds of 1981, Dara Monarch was assigned a weight of 125 pounds, making him the thirteenth best juvenile to race in Ireland that year, eight pounds behind the top weight Achieved. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 108, making him 24 pounds inferior to their top two-year-old Wind and Wuthering. In the following year Timeform rated him on 128, six pounds behind their best three-year-old colts Green Forest and Assert: they did, however append a \\"d\\" to his rating, indicating that his form had deteriorated. In the official International Classification he was given a rating of 83, making him the ninth best three-year-old colt in Europe, eleven pounds inferior to the top-rated Golden Fleece. Stud record At the end of his racing career Dara Monarch was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Grangewilliam Stud in Ireland. He was exported to Czechoslovakia in the late 1980s and spent the rest of his life at the Napajedla Stud. He reportedly died in January 2005. The best of his early crops was Broken Hearted, who won the Lockinge Stakes and became a successful National Hunt stallion, siring the Grand National winner Numbersixvalverde.

A dry forest is a habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature as being a predominantly deciduous forest located in a climate that is warm year-round, and may receive several hundred centimeters of rain per year, they have long dry seasons which last several months. Dry forests can receive 850-1100mm of precipitation per year. In the case of the U.S. Virgin islands forest high quantities of sea salt from the ocean decreases the growth height of the trees, aiding in the creation of two canopy layers that are commonly found at an elevation below 300 meters. Additionally the unique wind pattern that the islands create may have added to this effect. Within the three islands that make up the United States Virgin Islands, St. John has maintained a higher percentage of dry forest cover competing with St. Thomas at 43.1%; St. Croix has limited dry forest cover (9.22%). St. John and St. Thomas topography has significant steep hills and slopes compared to St. Croix. St. John is the most protected of the three islands, and as such it has the largest extensive tropical dry forests in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The island contains 650 native plants, 5,000 or more terrestrial insects, over 180 species of birds, of which 90% are native, and six native mammal bat species. One of the most common trees in the ‚Äúnative dry forest garden‚Äù is the amarat. They are acacias, (casha bush) but do not have thorns likes most other varieties. Zones and Characteristics The Virgin Islands Dry Forest are divided into four zones, Semi-evergreen, Semi- deciduous, Drought-deciduous, and Gallery semi-deciduous forest. Precisely 70-75% of Semi-evergreen forest consists of transitional characteristics of moist and dry forest. These characteristics consist of trees that maintain an evergreen pigmentation annually. Semi-evergreen forest usually grows in area that has the most moisture in the dry forest. This tends to be the edge of the dry forest at altitudes of 984 feet and decreasing. Semi-evergreen forest can be found on the steep slopes of St. John at Maho Bay, Crown Mountain St. John and Mount Eagle St. Croix. Common plants found in Semi-evergreen forest are Epiphytic plants, commonly referred as air-plants. These air-plants are often sited midcenter of the forest in Estate Grove on St. Croix. Semi-deciduous forest consist of 25% of evergreen trees and 75% of trees that tend to abandon their leaves, during cooler months. Semi-Deciduous forest relatively covers majority of land on all three islands. This is zone usually forms on Northern hill regions of each island. Semi-Deciduous forest can easily be found mid- island and Estate Northside on St. Croix. However, this location is limited to St. Croix, this division of forest can also be found Southern Magens Bay, Leinster Bay St. John and Southern Spray Bay on Water Island. Researchers speculate Semi-deciduous forest were not as dry as it seems, it is possible a community of plants that thrived in moist soil were present more than a decade before observations were recorded. The morphology of trees are quite distinct. In addition, this forest is separated in subdivisions classified as upper layer and bottom layer. The upper layer consists of small trees ranging from 8‚Äì11 meters and large trees 15‚Äì20 meters high. Bottom region is filled with a variety of saplings that grows from the leaf undercover. A few plants commonly found in this area are tan-tan (Leucaena leucocephala) and guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus). Drought deciduous forest and Gallery semi-deciduous forest has high quantities of deciduous trees (75%) unlike semi-evergreen forest and semi-deciduous forest. However, the distinct difference between Drought-deciduous and Gallery semi-deciduous forest is where they develop. Drought-deciduous tends to form on slopes, although, Gallery semi-deciduous forest grow in guts that lacks moisture. Gallery semi-deciduous forest are only found in guts in St. John, St. Thomas and St. Croix. The forest is found in upper land area in St. John, Peterborg hillside in St. Thomas and Mahogany Gut/ Caledonia in St. Croix. This forest is quite too semi-deciduous forest, however, in comparison to trees of the same species grow taller in Gallery semi-deciduous forest vs. semi-deciduous forest due to the saturation of moisture from the rain in the guts. Drought Deciduous forest are not as popular as semi-evergreen and semi-deciduous. Less than 1% of this forest inhabits St. Croix and Water Island, however, St. John has the greatest abundance located in eastern hillside regions. In addition, St. Thomas also occupies Drought Deciduous forest in Peterborg. Researchers typically identify Drought Deciduous forest near low elevations ranging lower than 250 meters usually, yet not limited to southern arid slopes. In addition, this zone also consisted of upper and lower layers; upper layers consist of the canopy ranging from 7‚Äì10 meters, with a minimum of tall trees up to 15 meters tall. Lower layers consist of shrub species that dries out rapidly compared to tall tree species. Trees commonly found in this forest is turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera). Rare Plants Solanum conocarpum in bloom, April 2017 The Solanum conocarpum also to referred as the Marron bacora is considered a rare plant that was discovered in the evergreen forest in St. John. Dispersal biology and organisms that consume the plant are uncertain (Gibney and Ray). In the late 1990s, five individuals were sighted and recorded in the mid- elevation forests of St. John. Subsequently, in February 2003, over 150 additional individuals were found by David Hamada on the island of St. John. As part of its conservation effort, the plant has since been planted at various other locations, including St. George's Village Botanical Gardens on St. Croix, the University of the VIrgin Islands' St. Thomas campus and Fairchild Botanical Gardens in Miami. Researchers have established the lack of seedlings is correlated to the lack of saplings. The seeds derived from a fruit that has fragile seed coating. With the lack of individuals in the wild, cross fertilization is challenging. Therefore, achieving reproduction in the wild is primarily unsuccessful. Disturbances The most common disturbances of Semi-evergreen disturbances are development of roads caused by human invasion. Creating new roads dirt and paved roads cause soil erosion that leads to depleted soil nutrients. The development of roads, buildings and rock crushing companies significantly decrease plant diversity and animal diversity. A dramatic example is the development of roads on Crown Mountain St. Thomas. This leads to extinction of plants, fungi and animals diversity. The lack of tree cover leads to an increase of arid regions. Semi-Deciduous forest also has challenging issues of disturbances. Disturbance effects are mainly caused by human interference. The land is manipulated for agriculture use frequently. Due to the unique diversity of the forests and animal species, the Virgin Islands dry forests need to be protected. In 2004, 315 terrestrial species in the Virgin Islands were on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (IUCN Red List) of Threatened Species. The islands serve as a wintering ground for birds such as the Cape May Warbler (Dendroica tigrine), Black-throated Blue Warbler (D. caerulescens), and Prairie Warbler (D. discolor). The intact forests are then necessary for the perpetuation of these Warbler species . Interspecies Interactions St. Croix Anole lizards tend to prey on ants significantly.

Orelh√£o (Big Ear; plural: Orelh√µes), officially Telefone de Uso P√∫blico (Public Use Telephone)Teleco ‚Äì Telefone de Uso P√∫blico ‚Äì TUP (Orelh√£o) is the name given to the protector for public telephones designed by Chinese Brazilian architect and designer Chu Ming Silveira. It was created on April 4, 1972 and it was initially used in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo.www.orelhao.arq.br Official website of orelh√£o and of its inventor Chu Ming Silveira Today, they are present everywhere in Brazil, as well as in other Latin American countries such as Peru, Colombia and Paraguay, in African countries like Angola and Mozambique, in China, and in other parts of the world.  Background  The installation of the first public payphones in Brazil dates from the 1920s, when the population of the country at that time was around 30.6 million inhabitants. Equipped with a token box and adapted to a common device, these semi-public telephones were found in commercial establishments that signed a contract with Companhia Telef√¥nica Brasileira (Brazilian Telephone Company), a Canadian-owned company that was then responsible for telephone services in the states of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Actual public payphones only appeared on Brazilian streets in mid-1971, when more than 93 million people were living in the country and mobile phones had not been created yet. The first cell phone would only be released two years later, being available to very few people. Out of the almost 100 million inhabitants of Brazil, 52 million lived in urban areas, according to IBGE data. In many places, due to the noise, listening and being heard from a public phone installed in the middle of the street was difficult. Attempting to solve the issue, CTB developed circular fiberglass and acrylic cabins and, to test the novelty, installed 13 of them in the city of S√£o Paulo. The result did not please the company, that detected an inadequate use of the equipment, a high rate of vandalism, and concluded that the spacious cabin, besides being uncomfortable, ended up bothering the passersby, obstructing the narrow sidewalks. Facing this disappointing diagnosis, architect Chu Ming Silveira went on to work on the project that would result in one of the greatest icons of Brazilian design: the \\"orelh√£o\\". The challenge was not small, as can be concluded from the detailed descriptive memo prepared by Chu Ming, who at that time headed the projects section of the Engineering Department of the Brazilian Telephony Company. Design and acoustics suited to Brazilian climatic conditions were at the root of the problem and the solution proposed by Chu Ming would eventually meet, with great success, the whole series of needs she had listed: # Phone protection. # User protection. # Low manufacturing and maintenance cost. # Low cost and simplicity of installation. # Durability and resistance to weather, and wear and tear. # Flexibility to adjust to areas of different concentrations. # Good acoustics. # Good aesthetics. # Attractiveness to the public. # Operational simplicity. # Possibility of uninterrupted use. # Good image of service to the public. # Institution of one more element in the urban landscape. # Ergonometrical satisfaction of Brazilian urban folk's fashion.  Development  Original design of the orelh√£o To achieve a cabin made of fiberglass, which should be strong, very light, resistant to sun, rain and fire and, according to newspapers of the time, \\"cheap\\", Chu Ming Silveira started with an egg shape; according to her, it is \\"the best acoustic form\\". The curvature of the dome offered an acoustic protection of 70 to 90 decibels, provided the user was under it. Most of the outside noise reaching the \\"shield\\" was reflected out, the remainder converging to the center of the radius of curvature, located well below the ear of the average user, in order to minimize interference in communication. Launched in 1972, the new booth soon started being incorporated into Brazilian landscapes. Although technically called \\"Chu II\\" by CTB and later immortalized as \\"orelh√£o,\\" it gained a number of curious nicknames, such as \\"tulip\\" and \\"astronaut's helmet\\". The press adopted \\"tulip,\\" which referred to the format of the set of 2 or 3 booths attached to the ground by an iron pipe through which the wires ran. The orange and blue \\"tulips\\" were equipped with red telephones produced in the Japanese city of Osaka, popularly called \\"reds\\" or \\"tamurinhas\\". For indoor environments, such as commercial and public offices, Chu Ming developed, before the orelh√£o, the \\"Chu I\\" or \\"orelhinha\\" (\\"small ear\\"), which was smaller and had an orange acrylic structure. It could be installed on a wall or adapted to different supports, at a height defined as the average of Brazilian men. The first ones were tested in mid-1971, in the lobby of CBT's headquarters building, at Rua 7 de Abril, central region of S√£o Paulo. On January 20, the day of its patron saint Saint Sebastian, the city of Rio de Janeiro received the first Orelh√µes of the Brazilian Telephone Company. The newspaper O Di√°rio de S√£o Paulo reported on the anniversary of the city of S√£o Paulo, on January 25, to announce the arrival of the new phones on the streets of the city: > \\"... And on this day, S√£o Paulo gets a gift from the Brazilian Telephone > Company: 170 telephone booths of a new model, christened \\"tulip\\" by its > creator, the Chinese architect Chu Ming.O Di√°rio de S√£o Paulo, Sunday, > January 23, 1972.\\" Keeping the commemorative tone, the text highlighted the quality of the design of said \\"tulips\\", \\"in which the technique matches environmental beauty.\\" According to the CTB, there were in S√£o Paulo about 4,000 public telephones then, while the ideal number to meet the demand would be 22,500. The success of orelh√£o could be verified not only by the sympathy with which the population received it, but also by the increase of calls made from public telephones. In March 1972, CTB estimated that the installation of the new equipment would cause a 12% increase in the number of average daily calls.  The success  An orelh√£o model. Chu Ming's invention gained admirers, eventually crossing the Atlantic in 1973. In a visit to Rio de Janeiro, the Secretary of Communications of Mozambique showed an interest in the equipment and the result was that three orelh√µes \\"emigrated\\" to the African continent. Today, the orelh√£o and adaptations of it are found in Latin American countries such as Peru, Colombia, Paraguay, and other African countries, such as Angola, and even in China, the home country of its idealizer. In the same year the Brazilian telephone booths were exported for the first time, Telecomunica√ß√µes de S√£o Paulo S.A. (TELESP), of the Telebr√°s group, replaced CTB as the company operating phone booths in the state of S√£o Paulo. In 1975, blue orelh√µes for long-distance calls were released. The demands considered by Chu Ming Silveira in the orelh√£o conception process seemed to be fully met, according to a comparative analysis of market research conducted for Telesp in 1977 and 1978: the public telephone service was considered \\"excellent\\" by 18.8% of respondents in 1977 and by 20.4% in the following year. It was considered \\"good\\" by 36.4% of respondents in 1977; by 1978, this number had increased to 37,7%. The phones, according to the survey, were used by 82% of the population, with 40% using it at least once a week. As for \\"modernity\\", in 1978, 73% of respondents agreed absolutely and 70% agreed that the orelh√µes were \\"very presentable\\"; 66% said they were \\"well-placed\\". Despite its expressive recognition for usefulness and quality of service, acts of vandalism against the orelh√µes were frequent and numerous. The enormous money loss caused to Telesp motivated the hiring of the publicist Jos√© Zaragoza in 1980. He was to create a short film that later would become an icon of Brazilian publicity. Using elements of police chronicles, the film \\"The Death of the Orelh√£o\\" caused a strong impact, showing a device unable to be operated, having been vandalized. Also as part of this effort to curb vandals' attacks, Telesp invested in a new cabin format in concrete and colorless tempered glass, in April of the same year. Initially tested in the cities of S√£o Paulo, Santos, Guaruj√°, S√£o Vicente and Campinas, and then installed throughout the state, the new cabin was not well accepted. In 1982, Telesp inaugurated the first community telephone in the Vila Prudente favela. The population developed a friendly relationship with the orelh√£o, as it made communication between the most distant and even unlikely places possible. A print advertisement in 1984 showed images of orelh√µes in different geographic settings of Brazil: on the beach, in the hills, in the typically rural area, on the side of a road. The text emphasized the companion character of the orelh√£o: \\"Telesp always puts a friendly little ear near you. On the coast, in the farms, on the roads, in the outskirts of S√£o Paulo, on the streets, squares and avenues, you'll always find a friendly little ear to listen to you: Telesp's orelh√µes.\\"Revista Veja, n¬∫ 827, July 11, 1984. Phone tokens were necessary to use the service. These were replaced by phone cards in 1992.  Changes and decline  On November 26, 1998, orelh√µes painted lime-green were seen for the first time, marking the acquisition of Telesp by Spanish company Telef√≥nica. This was part of the privatization process resulting from the breakup of Telebr√°s that also affected eleven other companies. New fiberglass \\"totems\\" were launched by the company in 1999, but the orelh√£o continued on the streets, as they were part of the daily life of Brazil. Currently, in the state of S√£o Paulo, there are 210,000 of them, according to Telef√≥nica. The trend is that this number will decrease, due to Anatel's ordinance reducing the minimum number of payphones throughout the country to 4 per thousand inhabitants, from the previous 6. Also the advance of mobile telephony has been contributing to the decline of public telephones. In December 2011, there were about 143 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants in the state of S√£o Paulo. At the beginning of 2012, there were 247,6 million cell phones throughout Brazil. At the same time, a survey by Telef√≥nica found that the sale of phone cards fell 45% in the state of S√£o Paulo, compared to the first half of 2011. The company has decided to deactivate the \\"tulips\\" from the 70s, but it should maintain the devices to ensure that users do not have to walk more than 300 meters to have access to one of these long-standing devices.

Biography Woeltz was born in San Antonio, Texas, where he first began his art studies under Jose Arpa and alongside Xavier Gonzales. He went on to attend the Academie Julian in France and later the Art Institute of Chicago. In addition to painting, he worked as an art professor for various colleges and universities, including the University of Texas at Austin and Sul Ross State Teachers College where he served as the art director in 1932 and started the summer art colony program. Throughout his career, he painted several regional murals, notably a series of large murals in Alpine, Texas as well as six murals for the U.S. Post Office in Amarillo, Texas. These murals tended to depict landscapes and activities of the surrounding region depicted in the Regionalist style popularized by Thomas Hart Benton. He regularly spent time in Mexico studying the muralists there, and appears to have been influenced by Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco. Several of his works were commissioned and funded by the WPA and The Section. In his lifetime, his work was displayed in numerous exhibitions, including the Legion of Honor Museum, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, and M. Knoedler & Company. He died in San Antonio, Texas in 1956 and is buried in the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery.

On 9 July 1992, the first AM IBOC transmission was sent from the Xetron offices in Cincinnati, since the company was contracted by the USADR to work on the project. In 2000, the company was awarded a $2.1 million contract from ViaSat to develop a MIDS-LVT radio system.  Intelligence work for the government  In 2011 it was revealed that the company worked with HBGary and Palantir on attribution for deanonymizing Internet activists of Anonymous. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden it has been sharing hacking techniques with intelligence agencies since at least 2010. In that year they developed a malicious Windows software named \\"Orca\\" for preventing malware detection by antivirus software. With WikiLeaks' Vault 7 disclosures in 2017, it was revealed that Xetron developed tools allowing unauthorized access to Cisco routers for the CIA as well as \\"Cinnamon\\" ‚àí an implant for Cisco devices.

Biography  Prior to his consecration as patriarch, Joseph was a monk at the Monastery of Gubba Baraya, near Mabbogh. According to Dionysius I Telmaharoyo, Joseph was elected as patriarch in 790 in fear of the Monastery of Gubba Baraya, which was powerful enough to cause serious disruption to the church. He is not considered to have been particularly intelligent as a result of his lack of education.Palmer (1990), p. 179 Soon after his consecration, Zachariah, former Bishop of Edessa, who had been removed due to complaints from local clergy, convinced Joseph to travel with him to the city to persuade locals to accept him as their bishop. The Syriac Orthodox population of Edessa, however, rejected Zachariah. Joseph served as patriarch until his death in 792 whilst visiting a monastery near Tell Beshmay.

Life Pines was born in Lutsk, now in Ukraine, but then in Russia in 1918. Her family moved to Antwerp and her father who was a surgeon was given a medal by the King of Belgium. Later her father moved to London and despite his qualifications he had to work as an ordinary doctor. Her first degree was in languages at University College London. Qualified in four languages she went to the Sorbonne but returned to England as war broke out. Between 1940 and 1945 she retrained as a physician and at the same time she lost family members in the holocaust in Europe. Pines married Anthony Lewison after the war and had two sons. She also worked after the war taking some interest in dermatology and working at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital and the South London Hospital for Women and Children Her interest and lack of success at dermatology led her to experiment with an emotional approach to reducing skin problems. She met Hilda Abraham and this led her to an interest in psychology. She enrolled at the Hampstead Child Therapy Course and Clinic in 1959 and she became a qualified psychoanalyst in 1965. She then went into private practice. She had interests in women's psychology and psychosomatic illness. Pines was able to donate material to Karl Abraham's biography. He had analysed his daughter, Hilda, when she was six noting details of her reaction to enemas and masturbation. Hilda died in 1971 and as the analysis had been passed to Pines she was able to add it to the record of Karl Abraham's work in 1974.

Named after the River Forth, she is the first Batch 2 River-class vessel to be built. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 13 April 2018, following a commissioning ceremony at her homeport HMNB Portsmouth. As of January 2020, she replaced HMS Clyde as the Falklands Patrol ship. Construction On 6 November 2013, it was announced that the Royal Navy had signed an agreement in principle to build three new offshore patrol vessels based on the River-class design (more specifically, the larger derivative) at a fixed price of ¬£348 million, including spares and support. In August 2014, BAE Systems signed a contract to build the ships on the River Clyde in Scotland. The ships, which were designated Batch 2 of the River-class, were to be globally-deployable and capable of carrying out constabulary tasks, such as counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling. As the first ship of the new batch, Forth, included some 29 modifications and enhancements over the baseline Amazonas design. Steel was first cut for Forth on 10 October 2014 at BAE Systems' Govan shipyard in Glasgow. She was launched in September 2016, being floated off a semi-submersible barge in the Clyde rather than receiving a traditional dynamic launch. After launch, she was moved down the Clyde for fitting out at BAE Systems' Scotstoun shipyard. She was christened at a ceremony at Scotstoun on 9 March 2017. In late March 2017, it was announced that the crew of Batch 1 vessel would be transferred to Forth to bring her into service. On 31 August 2017, Forth sailed for contractor sea trials. It was reported in October 2017 that Forth had been earmarked to replace as the Falkland Islands guardship. It was announced on 25 January 2018 that Forth had been accepted by the Ministry of Defence from BAE Systems and would shortly sail to HM Naval Base Portsmouth for commissioning. She arrived in Portsmouth for the first time on 26 February 2018. Operational history =Commissioning and early faults= Forth was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 13 April 2018 following a ceremony at HMNB Portsmouth. Soon after her commissioning, some faults were identified with her electrical system and sheared bolts were also discovered with heads that had been glued back on. In June 2018, it was announced that Forth would be entering dry dock for major rectification work which was likely to take more than three months. The Royal Navy reactivated to cover planned patrols by Forth with BAE Systems covering the additional costs. In October, Anderson Smith, BAE Systems Commercial Director ‚Äì Naval Ships, admitted that \\"minor defects\\" had been found but announced that they had since been fixed. In June 2019, Forth underwent Operational Sea Training in British waters in preparation for her first operational deployment. She later sailed from Liverpool to escort a Russian Navy patrol ship which was transiting through the UK's area of interest. She then made her inaugural fishery protection patrol and her first visit to an overseas port, which was to Gibraltar before, once again, escorting the same Russian ship through the English Channel. =Falkland Islands= On 13 January 2020, Forth arrived at the East Cove Military Port in the Falkland Islands on her first operational deployment, taking over from her older sister ship Clyde as the permanently-stationed guardship. Prior to her arrival, she exercised with Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 interceptors to trial how the platforms could operate together. As part of her deployment, Forth was on standby to assist the island's authorities in anything from ceremonial events to emergencies. Her support also extended to the nearby South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. The arrival of Forth stoked the ongoing Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute between the UK and Argentina with Argentina's Secretary of the Malvinas, Antarctica and the South Atlantic Islands, Andres Dachary, condemning the deployment as a violation of the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone.

Sponsorship As one of ABC's \\"co-operative programs\\", Constance Bennett Calls on You was part of a plan under which advertisers paid only for sponsorship in their own listening areas. The live broadcasts had commercials inserted by local announcers. Broadcasts were sponsored by various businesses (mainly department stores and specialty stores) in the markets in which the program was heard. By late October 1945, the number of sponsors had reached 26. Bennett often integrated advertising into her comments. Advertisers were notified in advance what items of clothing or accessories she planned to talk about in a particular day's broadcast. Sponsors who had those items for sale could then advertise in newspapers and in-store promotions that Bennett would be talking about them on that day's program.

He has been a gay activist from his college years onward, and was the founder of the Cornell Student Homophile League, the University of Toronto Homophile Association (UTHA), and The Body Politic gay liberation journal, Canada‚Äôs most significant gay periodical. He was a founding member of Toronto Gay Action (TGA), and the Toronto Gay Alliance toward Equality (GATE). On February 13, 1972 he became the first gay liberation representative to address a political party conference in Canada when he addressed a session of the New Democratic Party Waffle convention. In 1973 he began collecting the books, newspapers and ephemera that seeded and grew into the Canadian Lesbian & Gay Archives. He opened Glad Day Bookshop, the first gay and lesbian bookstore in Canada, in 1970 and operated it until 1991 when he sold the store John Scythes. In 1979 he opened a second Glad Day Bookshop in Boston, Mass. Glad Day Bookshop Toronto is now considered the oldest gay/lesbian bookshop in the world. Glad Day Bookshop Boston closed its doors in the summer of 2000, when its lease expired and its building was sold. Biography Moldenhauer graduated from Cornell University in 1969. In May 1968 he founded the Cornell Student Homophile League, which was only the second such homophile group established at an American university. In 1969 he moved to Canada and worked as a research assistant in the Physiology Department at the University of Toronto. There he founded the University of Toronto Homophile Association (UTHA) which held its first meeting on October 24, 1969. UTHA was the first student homophile organization in Canada, and the first gay and lesbian group to be established in Toronto; in 1970, it inspired the founding of the Community Homophile Association of Toronto (CHAT). The University of Toronto fired him for founding the gay student organization in January, 1970. Moldenhauer founded the Glad Day Bookshop in November, 1970, after noticing that gay literature that was emerging after Stonewall was not available in Canada. Moldenhauer sold books out of his backpack at rallies, meetings and parties, and offered a small mail order service. In its early days, Glad Day Bookshop operated out of Moldenhauer's 4 Kendal Avenue apartment, located in The Annex. This apartment also served as The Body Politic's office. The bookstore became the first significant target of censorship of gay & lesbian literature by the Canadian government. This escalated in 1986 when the government of PM Brian Mulroney created an internal memorandum D-9-1-1 which was distributed to all Canada Customs agents. The memorandum essentially encouraged border agents to declare almost all incoming gay & lesbian literature to be ‚Äúobscene‚Äù and therefore inadmissible. In the decade that followed Glad Day Bookshop Toronto endured four separate court cases challenging censorship. The most famous of these was the 1987 court decision that overturned the banning of The Joy of Gay Sex by Charles Silverstein and Edmund White. On February 13, 1972 he became the first gay liberation representative to address a political party conference in Canada when he addressed a session of the New Democratic Party Waffle convention.

In Toukiden 2, players will assume the mantle of a mysterious Slayer who has awakened after a ten-year slumber to a world shrouded in darkness. As revealed in Toukiden: The Age of Demons, humanity was protected for centuries by a secret clan of warriors, the Slayers, trained to dispose of the supernatural threat before it could consume the world. An event known as the Awakening caused rifts to appear in space and time ‚Äì resurfacing places that had long disappeared from the world and unleashing swarms of Oni that relentlessly hunted humans. Koei Tecmo published an anime short as a prequel to the game, the animation was handled by Studio 4¬∞C and it was directed by Takahiro Tanaka.

Plot The story of the film is based on the murder of Yazdgerd III, the last emperor of Sasanian Persia, who while being hard pressed by the Arabs on his western flank, fled to Marv where he was slain by a miller in a mill, in which he had been taking refuge. The film begins with the Zoroastrian high priest (magus) of the Persian Empire, accompanied by the imperial army commander entering the mill to try the miller accused of murdering the emperor. The miller, his wife and his daughter, while trying to exculpate themselves, all express a different version of the same incident. As the story shifts, more questions come up than are answered. A central theme in the film is the social disaffection among the general population of Persia at the eve of the Arab Islamic conquests and inequality in the highly class-based society, in which the wealthy elite and the Magi had amassed a disproportionate amount of wealth that they owed to heavy taxation and the benefactions of the pious.

His highly interdisciplinary work spans desert plant ecology, mangroves, island biogeography, sea birds, fisheries, oceanography, and deep-sea ecosystems. Between 2008 and 2019 he was director of the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS). He is now Professor of Plant Ecology at UC Riverside. Education Ezcurra received his B.S. from the University of Buenos Aires in 1973. He then received an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in plant biology from the University College of North Wales in 1978 and 1984, respectively. At Bangor, his primary mentor was Peter Greig-Smith, a renowned ecologist whose academic lineage of mentors can be traced back to Charles Darwin. Career Ezcurra was the principal researcher in charge of the Laboratory of Community Ecology at National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) from 1987 to 1998. In 1998, Ezcurra moved to San Diego, California to take on the roles of director of the Biodiversity Research Center of the Californias, and deputy director of research and collections at the San Diego Natural History Museum. In December 2000, Ezcurra was appointed president of Mexico's National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (Instituto Nacional de Ecolog√≠a y Cambio Clim√°tico), and independent research branch of Mexico's Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Secretar√≠a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) from 2000 to 2005. Ezcurra returned as head of research to the San Diego Natural History Museum, where he remained until 2008, when he assumed his current role as professor of plant ecology at UC Riverside, as well as director of UC MEXUS. Ezcurra has also served as president of the board of the Mexican National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP), and Scientific Chair for the CITES Convention. As an active member of the Mexican National System of Researchers (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores), Ezcurra also lectures and is a graduate adviser at a number of Mexican universities and research centers, as well as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Other achievements from Dr. Ezcurra's 40-year research career, include developing the first environmental impact assessments in Mexico, playing a central part in the establishment of multiple natural protected areas (including the El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve and the Islands of the Gulf of California). Dr. Ezcurra also played a key role in promoting the creation of the California condor release program in Baja California, and initiating the successful restoration of Guadalupe Island in the Mexican Pacific. =Research= Ezcurra has published more than 170 research papers, books, and book chapters. These include three books about the Gulf of California and its surrounding islands, and a large number of essays and articles for newspapers and popular journals. Ezcurra's areas of research include conservation science, the ecology and biogeography of coastal deserts, land-ocean interactions and their impact on both marine and terrestrial environments, the application of mathematical modeling in ecology and conservation, and the management of natural resources in areas under traditional use. In his career as a plant ecologist, Dr. Ezcurra has worked to describe the relationships between marine and terrestrial ecological systems, and the processes that drive highly productive environments. His academic works include a range of highly cited papers covering desert plant ecology,See, e.g. Ezcurra et al. 1987; Valiente-Banuet et al. 1991; Caso et al. 2007; Delgado-Fern√°ndez et al. 2016 mangroves,See, e.g. L√≥pez-Portillo & Ezcurra 1989; Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008; L√≥pez-Medell√≠n et al. 2011; Ezcurra et al. 2016 island biogeography,See, e.g. Garcill√°n et al. 2008, Velarde et al. 2014, Wilder et al. 2014 sea birds,See, e.g. Velarde et al. 2004, Velarde et al. 2013, Velarde et al. 2015 fisheries, oceanography, and deep sea ecosystems. One of the principal strengths and contributions of Ezcurra's ecological research is the ability to document the individual components of an ecosystem and then synthesize these components at a regional landscape level. Examples of this approach include: =Conservation= Dr. Ezcurra is known for translating scientific research into tangible, positive conservation outcomes. His work has influenced policy at the highest levels of government. It has also created strong and lasting collaborations between the governments of Mexico and the United States, as well as between academic institutions and non-governmental organizations from both countries. Specific instances include: * The first Environmental Impact Assessments for impacts to mangrove forests on Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula * The establishment of El Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in 1993 and its subsequent classification as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013, * The establishment of the Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. * The establishment of Cabo Pulmo Natural Protected area, in Baja California Sur, Mexico, in 1995. =Science Popularization= From the outset of his career, Ezcurra has pursued the dissemination of science to the general public through his writing, museum work, and other creative media.

Verizon Communications acquired AOL in 2015. When Verizon Communications purchased Yahoo! in 2017, it merged AOL and Yahoo! into a subsidiary named Oath Inc. In December 2018, Verizon announced it would write down the combined value of its purchases of AOL and Yahoo! by $4.6 billion, roughly half. Verizon renamed the company Verizon Media in January 2019.

History  Verizon announced a $4.4 billion deal to acquire AOL in May 2015. The deal was an effort by Verizon to expand its technology and media offerings. The deal officially closed a month later. A year after the completion of the AOL acquisition, Verizon announced a $4.8 billion deal for Yahoo!'s core Internet business, looking to invest in the Internet company's search, news, finance, sports, video, email and Tumblr products. Yahoo! announced in September and December 2016 two major Internet security breaches affecting more than a billion customers.

The deal closed on June 13, 2017, and Oath was launched. Upon completion of the deal, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer resigned. Yahoo! operations not acquired in the deal were renamed Altaba, a holding company whose primary assets are its 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo! Japan. After the merger, Oath cut fifteen percent of the Yahoo-AOL workforce. In 2018, Altaba sold Yahoo! Japan to SoftBank Group. In April 2018, Helios and Matheson acquired the Moviefone movie listings website from Oath. As part of the transaction, Verizon took a stake in Helios and Matheson Analytics stock. In May 2018, Verizon and Samsung agreed to terms that would preload four Oath applications (\\"apps\\") onto Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphones. The agreement includes Oath‚Äôs Newsroom, Yahoo! Sports, Yahoo! Finance, and go90 mobile video apps (closed in July 2018), with integration of native Oath advertisements into both the Oath apps and Samsung‚Äôs own Galaxy and Game Launcher apps. On September 12, 2018, it was announced that K. Guru Gowrappan would succeed Tim Armstrong as CEO, effective October 1. On December 3, 2018, the company declared a new set of rules for the Tumblr community that took effect December 17, 2018, banning \\"adult content\\". This move raised objections that it harms their LGBTQ community, sexual abuse survivors, sex workers, adult content blogs, and other bloggers. The move came after the Tumblr app was removed from the Apple App Store due to issues with child pornography, leading some to speculate that the ban may have been made to regain access to the App Store. In December 2018 Verizon announced that it was cutting 10% of Oath's workforce and would write down the value of the business by $4.6B. Verizon management blamed competitive pressures and that the business never achieved the anticipated benefits. The move wiped out all of the goodwill on the balance sheets that accompanied the acquisitions. Oath was renamed Verizon Media on January 8, 2019. In August 2019, Verizon sold Tumblr to Automattic, the owner of WordPress.com, for an undisclosed amount which was reportedly less than $3 million.

History of Cherington Park  Earliest records of a manor house in Cherington date back to 1074, owned by Robert D‚ÄôOyly, Lord of Wallingford. In 1740 this manor house was replaced with Cherington Park, as it stands today, by John Neale. Neale died in 1749 passing Cherington Park to his son in law, Sir John Turner, 3rd Baronet (MP). By 1766 Turner went on to sell Cherington to Samuel Smith, who passed it on to his son Samuel Smith (MP). The estate was then sold by Samuel Smith‚Äôs widow, Mary, to John George. George added Coxes Farm and some glebe land to the estate, passing it to his son, William, in 1824. William George inherited Westrip Farm and Hazleton Farm from his uncle William George in 1832. William George left the Cherington Estate to his two grandchildren, Constance and Gertrude who ultimately sold it to Edward S. Tarlton. Edward S. Tarlton, an engineer returning to England having lived in India under colonial rule, bought the Cherington Estate for ¬£15,000 in 1934. Tarlton made many changes to the village including the introduction of running water and electricity. Tarlton died in 1954 dividing the Cherington Estate between his three children; Helen Tarlton, Edward Tarlton and Geoffrey Tarlton. Cherington Park was given to Geoffrey Tarlton where, like many houses at the time, the south facing wing was destroyed.  The Estate  The Cherington Estate encompasses the following: * Cherington House, Coach House, Stables and Park * Westrip Farm * Coxes Farm * Grove Farm * Summerwell Farm * Field Farm * Colly Farm * Grove Cottages * Yew Tree Cottages * Tudor House * Cherington Village * Cherington Lake * Landers Wood * North Bank Wood References External links Villages in Gloucestershire Civil parishes in Gloucestershire Cotswold District ","title":"Cherington, Gloucestershire"},{"id":"53690760","text":"William Leader (19 October 1767 ‚Äì 18 January 1828) was a British Member of Parliament for Camelford and Winchelsea He represented Camelford from 1812 to 1818, and Winchelsea from 1823 to 1826.

The book is a fictionalised account of the life of Sudanese poet Hassan Awad Aboulela. History Aboulela decided to write a novel based on the life of her uncle, a poet in the 1940s who was bedridden for 20 years. She moved the events of his life into the 1950s so they would coincide with Sudanese independence. Aboulela states that by writing a book set in Sudan, she wanted to dispel \\"stereotypical images of famine and war\\" so often associated with the country. Plot In 1950s Sudan, beautiful student Soraya can barely wait to marry her handsome and intelligent cousin Nur. Nur has dreams of being a poet, but his father, wealthy businessman Mahmoud Abuzeid, is completely opposed to this. He wants Nur to go to an English university in the United Kingdom and take over the family business as Mahmoud's oldest son Nasir is lazy and a spendthrift. Meanwhile, Nur's impoverished former tutor Usatz Badr secretly encourages him to write poetry. Nur's brilliant future is ruined when he dives from the beach at Alexandria and becomes a quadriplegic. Despite several surgeries, neurologists are unable to cure him. The Abuzeud family is divided in the aftermath.
