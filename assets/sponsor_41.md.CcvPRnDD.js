Retrieved 13 April 2014 He was editor of Eidsvold Blad 1916-1918 and combined this with working as a teacher at Eidsvoll folk high school. He became head of Telemark Agricultural School in 1918. Having married a farmer's daughter in 1912, he also ran his wife's family farm after 1913.Borgen (1999), p. 248 Politics According to Halvdan Koht who knew Kolseid when he was young, he was initially conservative and later sympathized with the Liberal Party.Gabrielsen (1970), p. 58 He became a member of the Farmer's Party when it was formed in 1920. He candidated for the Norwegian Agrarian Association in the 1918 Norwegian parliamentary election and for the Farmer's Party in the 1921 election, both times without getting elected. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway for the Centre Party from Telemark in the 1924 parliamentary election.Borgen (1999), p. 249 In the Parliament he served as member of the Committee on Social Affairs from 1924 to 1931. Later he would become member of the Committee on Forestry and Watercourses and in 1937 a member of the Committee on University and Higher Education. He became a member of the Executive Board of the Farme's Party in 1926 and the same year elected deputy leader under Kristoffer H√∏gset. In 1929, he became leader of the party, a position he held to 1938.Gabrielsen (1970), p. 60 He also served as parliamentarian leader of the Farmer's Party from 1931 to 1940, with the exception of the period 1932-1933 when he served as prime minister. He was credited within the party for being a good administrator. As a member of the Social Committee, Hundseid came in opposition to the Labour Party on unemployment issues, where he often argued that the unemployed could do more to get a job and believed economic support for them should mostly be restricted to food stations. His relationship with the Liberal Party and its leader Johan Ludwig Mowinckel was also often tense.Gabrielsen (1970), p. 59 Prime minister and return to parliament When the Farmer's Party formed its first cabinet in 1931, Peder Kolstad was chosen as prime minister instead of Jens Hundseid who was seen as too controversial for the role. He wasn't included in the cabinet either. However, when Kolstad died the following year, Hundseid was appointed prime minister in March 1932 and formed the Hundseid's Cabinet, mostly with the same ministers as in the preceding Kolstad Cabinet. In addition to the position as prime minister, Hundseid also served as Minister of Agriculture.Borgen (1999), p. 250 Hundseid didn't want Minister of Defence Vidkun Quisling to continue in the cabinet but Quisling argued hard to keep it and was supported by many other ministers. He was included in the cabinet, but had a difficult relationship to Hundseid from the start. In April 1932, Quisling strongly attacked the Labour Party in the trontale (opening secession debate) in the Parliament. The Labour Party responded by a motion of no-confidence against the cabinet, but did not gain majority for the motion.Borgen (1999), p. 251 In summer 1932, diplomat Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg secretly gave authorization from Hundseid to negotiate the Eastern Greenland dispute with Denmark. In October, he returned to Norway with a proposal to a treaty where Norway gave up the claim of sovereignty of Eastern Greenland, but was granted economic rights to fishing and trapping in the area. The negotiations was not publicly known before the Summer 1933 when Norway lost the dispute in the International Court of Justice and Hundseid who then had resigned as Prime Minister was sharply criticized in the Parliament for having permitted the negotiations.Borgen (1999), p. 253 The Hundseid cabinet fell in March 1933 when the Labour Party and the Liberal Party both supported a motion of no-confidence over the cabinet's economic politics. It was replaced by Mowinckel's Third Cabinet. Hundseid went back to his prior role as parliamentarian leader in the Parliament in addition to being the party's leader.Borgen (1999), p. 255 Nasjonal Samling membership and conviction after WWII After the German occupation of Norway in April 1940, Hundseid was approached during the summer by a representative from Reichskommissariat Norwegen who wanted Hundseid to lead a new organization for farmers which was meant to replace the Norwegian Agrarian Association. Hudseid declined the offer. In the autumn, he was called to a meeting with Nasjonal Samling councillor of state Sverre Riisn√¶s. In a follow-up meeting, Riisn√¶s gave Hundseid a declaration written by Quisling which he wanted Hundseid to sign. Hundseid signed a somewhat moderated statement where he declared he would become a member of Nasjonal Samling and be writing newspaper contributions in favour of NS.Borgen (1999), p. 254 While Hudseid distanced himself from Nasjonal Samling and fascism after the war, he also had a track record of stark, anti-semitic statements, including claims that jews were \\"not real Norwegians\\" Store norske leksikon After the liberation of Norway on 8 May 1945, Hundseid was arrested the following day. During the legal purge he was charged with five crimes: *Treason, for having joined Nasjonal Samling after the occupation. *Tried to pressure members of the administration in Buskerud to become members of Nasjonal Samling. *Written two articles in Buskerud Blad and Fritt Folk which was published in 1940 where he encouraged people generally to become members of Nasjonal SamlingAnden√¶s (1998), p. 223 *In a circular to mayors in Buskerud encouraged them to collaborate with Nasjonal Samling. *Granted 5,000 Norwegian kroner to the surviving family members of Norwegians who had fought for Germany on the Eastern Front. Despite his record of anti-semtism, some historians regard him as a mostly passive member of Nasjonal Samling.Anden√¶s (1998), p. 256 In the lagmannsrett, he was found guilty and sentenced to twelve years of penal labour, confiscation of ca. 54,000 Nkr and to pay a compensation of 25,000 Nkr to the government. The Supreme court reduced the sentence to ten years of penal labour and also reduced the confiscation amount. He was released in 1949, having been imprisoned for four years.Borgen (1999), p. 256 Later years Hundseid died in Oslo on 2 April 1965.

It was devised by George Kelly in around 1955 and is based on his personal construct theory of personality. Republished in 1991 as:  Introduction  The repertory grid is a technique for identifying the ways that a person construes (interprets or gives meaning to) his or her experience. It provides information from which inferences about personality can be made, but it is not a personality test in the conventional sense. It is underpinned by the personal construct theory developed by George Kelly, first published in 1955. A grid consists of four parts: # A topic: it is about some part of the person's experience # A set of elements, which are examples or instances of the topic. Working as a clinical psychologist, Kelly was interested in how his clients construed people in the roles they adopted towards the client, and so, originally, such terms as \\"my father\\", \\"my mother\\", \\"an admired friend\\" and so forth were used. Since then, the grid has been used in much wider settings (educational, occupational, organisational) and so any well-defined set of words, phrases, or even brief behavioral vignettes can be used as elements. For example, to see how a person construes the purchase of a car, a list of vehicles within that person's price range could be a set of elements. # A set of constructs. These are the basic terms that the client uses to make sense of the elements, and are always expressed as a contrast. Thus the meaning of \\"good\\" depends on whether you intend to say \\"good versus poor\\", as if you were construing a theatrical performance, or \\"good versus evil\\", as if you were construing the moral or ontological status of some more fundamental experience. # A set of ratings of elements on constructs. Each element is positioned between the two extremes of the construct using a 5- or 7-point rating scale system; this is done repeatedly for all the constructs that apply; and thus its meaning to the client is modeled, and statistical analysis varying from simple counting, to more complex multivariate analysis of meaning, is made possible. Constructs are regarded as personal to the client, who is psychologically similar to other people depending on the extent to which s/he would tend to use similar constructs, and similar ratings, in relating to a particular set of elements. The client is asked to consider the elements three at a time, and to identify a way in which two of the elements might be seen as alike, but distinct from, contrasted to, the third. For example, in considering a set of people as part of a topic dealing with personal relationships, a client might say that the element \\"my father\\" and the element \\"my boss\\" are similar because they are both fairly tense individuals, whereas the element \\"my wife\\" is different because she is \\"relaxed\\". And so we identify one construct that the individual uses when thinking about people: whether they are \\"tense as distinct from relaxed\\". In practice, good grid interview technique would delve a little deeper and identify some more behaviorally explicit description of \\"tense versus relaxed\\". All the elements are rated on the construct, further triads of elements are compared and further constructs elicited, and the interview would continue until no further constructs are obtained.  Using the repertory grid  Careful interviewing to identify what the individual means by the words initially proposed, using a 5-point rating system could be used to characterize the way in which a group of fellow-employees are viewed on the construct \\"keen and committed versus energies elsewhere\\", a 1 indicating that the left pole of the construct applies (\\"keen and committed\\") and a 5 indicating that the right pole of the construct applies (\\"energies elsewhere\\"). On being asked to rate all of the elements, our interviewee might reply that Tom merits a 2 (fairly keen and committed), Mary a 1 (very keen and committed), and Peter a 5 (his energies are very much outside the place of employment). The remaining elements (another five people, for example) are then rated on this construct. Typically (and depending on the topic) people have a limited number of genuinely different constructs for any one topic: 6 to 16 are common when they talk about their job or their occupation, for example. The richness of people's meaning structures comes from the many different ways in which a limited number of constructs can be applied to individual elements. A person may indicate that Tom is fairly keen, very experienced, lacks social skills, is a good technical supervisor, can be trusted to follow complex instructions accurately, has no sense of humour, will always return a favour but only sometimes help his co-workers, while Mary is very keen, fairly experienced, has good social and technical supervisory skills, needs complex instructions explained to her, appreciates a joke, always returns favours, and is very helpful to her co-workers: these are two very different and complex pictures, using just 8 constructs about a person's co-workers. Important information can be obtained by including self-elements such as \\"Myself as I am now\\"; \\"Myself as I would like to be\\" among other elements, where the topic permits.  Analysis of results  A single grid can be analysed for both content (eyeball inspection) and structure (cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and a variety of structural indices relating to the complexity and range of the ratings being the chief techniques used). Sets of grids are dealt with using one or other of a variety of content analysis techniques. A range of associated techniques can be used to provide precise, operationally defined expressions of an interviewee's constructs, or a detailed expression of the interviewee's personal values, and all of these techniques are used in a collaborative way. The repertory grid is emphatically not a standardized \\"psychological test\\"; it is an exercise in the mutual negotiation of a person's meanings. The repertory grid has found favour among both academics and practitioners in a great variety of fields because it provides a way of describing people's construct systems (loosely, understanding people's perceptions) without prejudging the terms of reference‚Äîa kind of personalized grounded theory. Unlike a conventional rating-scale questionnaire, it is not the investigator but the interviewee who provides the constructs on which a topic is rated. Market researchers, trainers, teachers, guidance counsellors, new product developers, sports scientists, and knowledge capture specialists are among the users who find the technique (originally developed for use in clinical psychology) helpful.For example:  Relationship to other tools  In the book Personal Construct Methodology, researchers Brian R. Gaines and Mildred L.G. Shaw noted that they \\"have also found concept mapping and semantic network tools to be complementary to repertory grid tools and generally use both in most studies\\" but that they \\"see less use of network representations in PCP [personal construct psychology] studies than is appropriate\\". They encouraged practitioners to use semantic network techniques in addition to the repertory grid.On constructivist multimethodology see also, for example:  See also  * Graph (abstract data type) * Idea networking * Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure * Knowledge representation and reasoning * Q methodology * Tree (data structure)  Notes   Further reading   *  External links  = Software = * OpenRepGrid ‚Äì An R package for the analysis of repertory grids * Repertory Grid Tool ‚Äì An open source web tool for repertory grids * rep:grid ‚Äì repertory grid software, 3D Grid Analysis * WebGrid 5 * nextexpertizer ‚Äì computer supported repertory grid interview and analysis tool * Idiogrid ‚Äì Idiographic Analysis with Repertory Grids * Gridsuite ‚Äì Repertory Grid Software Constructivism (psychological school) Factor analysis Knowledge representation Psychological testing ","title":"Repertory grid"},{"id":"1201360","text":"There are two municipalities named Webster in Wisconsin: *Webster, Burnett County, Wisconsin, a village *Webster, Vernon County, Wisconsin, a town vo:Webster (Wisconsin) ","title":"Webster, Wisconsin"},{"id":"1201366","text":"Sir Gordon Ivan Hobday (1 February 1916 ‚Äì 27 May 2015) was a British scientist who worked on penicillin with Alexander Fleming and is noted for his role as director of the Boots research team that developed ibuprofen.

Established in 1846, it was the first United States Army military outpost of the recently annexed state. Confederate Army troops stationed there saw action during the American Civil War. In the early 20th century, it was garrisoned in relation to military activity over border conflicts with Mexico. Surviving elements of the fort were designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Early years In 1846, Captain Joseph K. MansfieldBauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York: Macmillan, directed the construction of a star-shaped earthwork for 800 men called \\"Fort Texas\\" on the northern side of the Rio Grande, \\"by the order from General [Zachary] Taylor to command the city of Matamoros\\" south of the river.Ashcroft, A.C., 1963, \\"Fort Brown, Texas, in 1861,\\" in Texas Military History, A Quarterly Publication of The National Guard Association of Texas, Vol. 3, Winter, 1963, No. 4, pp. 246-247 The next year, the fort was besieged during the opening of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. During the Siege of Fort Texas, two Americans were killed, including Major Jacob Brown and George Oakes Stevens (of Vermont) of the 2nd Dragoons. In honor of the fallen major, General Taylor renamed the post as Fort Brown. In 1849, the city of Brownsville, Texas, was established not far from the fort's grounds, after the United States had acquired Texas following the war. Cortina While in command at the fort, Major Samuel P. Heintzelman coordinated with John Salmon Ford in the Cortina Troubles, culminating in the Battle of Rio Grande City in 1859. Civil War In 1861 Confederate Col. John \\"Rip\\" Ford occupied the fort,Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, with a garrison there until 1863. The Confederate forces were finally driven out by Union forces under General Nathaniel P. Banks, who had his troops camped in tents erected at the fort site. This Union occupation ended in 1864, when Confederate forces under General James E. Slaughter and Colonel Ford took control of the area. They held the post until the end of the war, when it was occupied again by Union forces under General Egbert Brown. Postbellum From 1867-1869, a permanent US Army fort was constructed under the supervision of Capt. William A. Wainwright. =William C. Gorgas= In 1882, Dr. William Crawford Gorgas was assigned to the hospital at Fort Brown during the height of a yellow fever outbreak. Using Fort Brown as his base of operations, Gorgas studied the disease for several years. He was sent to Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Brownsville raid A unit of African-American soldiers, known as Buffalo Soldiers, were stationed at Fort Brown. White residents of town resented the presence of the black soldiers, and tensions rose. On August 13 and 14, 1906, unknown persons \\"raided\\" Brownsville, indiscriminately shooting bystanders. They wounded one white man and killed white resident Frank Natus. The townspeople of Brownsville quickly blamed the black soldiers for the incident. The Army investigated the matter and concluded that the black soldiers were guilty, although their supervising officers supported them and said they had been at the fort. William H. Taft, then President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War and soon to be elected as president, ordered all 168 black soldiers to be discharged \\"without honor\\". Sixty years later, the Army conducted another investigation, concluding that the African Americans were not responsible. They were given posthumous honorable discharges. But, by then, only two of the original 168 men were still alive. The Army did not restore the pensions to which the men would have been entitled to their descendants. Since the late 20th century, historians have speculated about the incident. The History Channel's program History's Mysteries attributed the incident to Brownsville residents' shooting up the town with rifles using the same caliber ammunition (45-70 ?) as the soldiers and then framing the soldiers. (Academic press books about the Brownsville Raid include The Brownsville Raid (1970/1992) and The Senator and the Sharecropper's Son: Exoneration of the Brownsville Soldiers (1997) by John D. Weaver, and Racial Borders: Black Soldiers along the Rio Grande (2010) by James Leiker.) First airplane to be attacked by hostile fire On April 20, 1915, U.S. Signal Corps Officers Byron Q. Jones and Thomas Millings flew a Martin T over the fort to spot movements of Mexican Revolutionary leader Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa. The plane reached an altitude of 2,600 ft. and was up for 20 minutes. It did not cross the border into Mexico, although it was fired upon by machine guns and small arms. These frequent patrols lasted for a period of 6 weeks and were used more effectively in 1916. 124th Cavalry The troopers stationed at Fort Brown from 1929-45 were from the 124th Cavalry Regiment, Texas National Guard, which was one of the last mounted cavalry regiments in the United States Army. On November 18, 1940, they went into active military training. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the division served with distinction, dismounted, in the China Burma India Theater, where a member of the unit from Fort Brown earned the theater's only Medal of Honor (awarded to Jack L. Knight, commanding F Troop). United States Army Air Forces use During World War II, Fort Brown was transferred to the USAAF Training Command on July 7, 1943. The USAAF Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command) used the fort for flexible gunnery training until the fort was inactivated on February 1, 1946.Manning, Thomas A.

It was acquired by the City of Brownsville and Texas Southmost College in 1948. Three areas that were once part of the post were designated a discontiguous National Historic Landmark District in 1960, in recognition of its historic importance.

Some records render his name as \\"Jin Hwon\\" (ÏßÑÌõ§). He was also the progenitor of the Hwanggan Gyeon clan. Substantial accounts of his life are preserved in the Samguk Sagi, which presents a single narrative, and the Samguk Yusa, which presents excerpts about him from various sources. Gyeon Hwon at Doosan Encyclopedia Gyeon Hwon at Britannica Korea Background Records say that Gyeon Hwon was born Lee, not Gyeon. Most accounts agree that Gyeon Hwon's father was Ajagae, a farmer of the Lee clan, and that he was born in what is today Gaeun-eup in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang province, as the oldest of six children. However, Gyeon Hwon later changed his family name to Gyeon. Some argue that he changed his surname to start afresh as the founder of Hubaekje. Gyeon Hwon is also the founder of the Hwanggan clan of the Gyeons. His sons, Singeom, Yanggeom, Yonggeom and Geumgang, are also listed as gyeon (Jin), not Lee. His mother was from the Gwangju area, but her exact identity is not known; Ajagae had two wives, Lady Sangwon and Lady Namwon, and Gyeon Hwon was born to his first wife. However, legend says that his mother was from Gwangju and gave birth to her firstborn son after having physical contact with a worm disguised as a man, and that Gyeon Hwon grew up drinking the milk of a tiger.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 125. Silk Pagoda (2006). Gyeon Hwon at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture The Silla court of Queen Jinseong was heavily corrupted and embroiled with political confusion. Widespread famine ravaged the country, driving many of the people into rebel forces. Village headmen, and new military forces arose and created power bases all over the country. The government who had tried to implement a forceful taxation plan found itself in the face of rebellions led by bandits, local nobles, and rebel leaders. It was during this time that Gyeon Hwon's father Ajagae led a local peasant revolt and set up base in Sangju. Ajagae at Doosan EncyclopediaPark Yeonggyu (Î∞ïÏòÅÍ∑ú), Annals of the Silla Dynasty (Ïã†ÎùºÏôïÏ°∞Ïã§Î°ù) pp 427-433, Woongjin, Seoul, 2004. Early life and founding of Hubaekje Gyeon Hwon is said to have left home at 15 to join the Silla army and became the commander of Silla forces in the Jeolla region.Choi Yong Beom (ÏµúÏö©Î≤î), Korean History in One Night (ÌïòÎ£ªÎ∞§Ïóê ÏùΩÎäî ÌïúÍµ≠Ïó≠ÏÇ¨), Paper Road, Seoul, 2008. While his father grabbed power in the Sangju region, he independently marshalled local peasants to his cause, and soon gathered many followers. In 892, Gyeon Hwon seized the cities of Wansanju and Mujinju, taking over the old territory of Baekje and winning the support of the people in the area who were hostile to Silla.Lee Hyun-hee, Park Sung-soo, Yoon Nae-hyun, translated by The Academy of Korean Studies, New History of Korea pp 263-265, Jimoondang, Paju, 2005. Gyeon Hwon declared himself the king of Hubaekje (\\"later Baekje\\") and established his capital at Wansanju in 900. He established government, made diplomatic ties with China, and continuously pursued the expansion of his kingdom amidst much conflict with Gung Ye of Hugoguryeo. Reign After crowning himself as ruler of Hubaekje, Gyeon Hwon sent his army to present-day Hapcheon, southwest of the Silla capital Gyeongju, but the campaign failed and the army retreated. Then in 910, when Wang Geon, the general of the rival kingdom of Hugoguryeo, attacked and captured the city of Naju, the very city in which Gyeon Hwon had started his rebellion, he made an attempt to retake the city from Wang but failed. In 918, Gung Ye, who had been maintaining his rule by acts of terror, was dethroned and murdered by his own army commanders. General and chief minister Wang Geon was crowned as their new ruler, marking the beginning point of Goryeo. Taejo at Doosan Encyclopedia Gyeon Hwon sent another major expedition to Hapcheon in 920 and finally succeeded in taking over the region, forcing King Gyeongmyeong into an alliance with Goryeo. Then he invaded the present-day Andong area, but his troops were defeated by local Silla guards. Gyeon Hwon was forced to make peace with Goryeo after the battle, through a hostage exchange of royal family members. However, when his nephew Jin Ho died, he killed the Goryeo hostage Wang Shin, cousin of Wang Geon, and resumed war against Goryeo. In 927, Gyeon Hwon led his army himself and directly attacked the Silla capital of Gyeongju. King Gyeongae was unprepared for this attack, and he chose suicide over capture by the invading army of Hubaekje. Gyeon Hwon then established Kim Bu (who became King Gyeongsun) as the next Silla king. On his way back, he was met by the forces led by Wang Geon, and easily defeated the Goryeo army, killing many of Wang's notable generals and warriors, with Wang barely escaping through the daring self-sacrifice of his general Shin Sung-gyeom and Kim Nak. One year later he took over the city of Jinju from Silla. Decline and fall Hubaekje and Goryeo were in constant state of hostilities without one being completely dominant over the other. However, in 930, the Hubaekje troops faced a heavy defeat at the Battle of Gochang (present-day Andong) and was unable to recover from the loss. Gyeon Hwon attempted to reverse the current by sacking the Goryeo capital of Gaeseong, but his army suffered another defeat in 934. Not only was Hubaekje reeling from military defeats, the kingdom was in internal disarray. In 935, Gyeon Hwon's eldest son Singeom, who had been slighted as heir to the throne in favor of his younger brother Geumgang, overthrew Gyeon Hwon with the aid of his brothers Yanggeom and Yonggeom. Singeom killed Geumgang and confined Gyeon Hwon to Geumsan Temple, but Gyeon Hwon escaped and fled to Goryeo and his old enemy Wang Geon, who welcomed him and provided him with land and slaves. King Gyeongsun of Silla formally surrendered to Goryeo in 935. The following year, at Gyeon Hwon's request, he and Wang Geon led a massive Goryeo army to Hubaekje and the kingdom fell. Gyeon Hwon died the same year of an inflamed tumor. Diplomacy Unlike his rival Gung Ye, Gyeon Hwon was active in diplomacy; he was formally confirmed by the Chinese kingdoms of Wuyue and Later Tang as the legitimate ruler of Hubaekje. In addition, he sought an alliance with the newly formed Liao Dynasty in the north, which was founded by the Khitans, in order to surround Goryeo from both north and south. Gyeon Hwon also sent envoys to Japan during his reign for mainly commercial reasons; the Jeolla region, where Gyeon Hwon began his kingdom, was the center of trade in East Asia during the period and had already served as the base for traders such as Jang Bogo. However, despite all of his diplomatic, military and trade abilities Gyeon Hwon lacked the political astuteness to found a viable state; his Hubaekje government system was not very much different from the one of Silla, which had been proven to be ineffective in centralizing the power of the local landlords and merchants. In the end, Hubaekje was not able to exercise influence over many of its people, paving the way for Goryeo to incorporate the kingdom and unify the Korean peninsula.

Born in Livorno, he began his career at Piaggio, makers of the Vespa scooter, but quickly moved up to larger engines. He worked at Isotta Fraschini before World War II, and then joined Reggiane to design aircraft engines. Lampredi's fame brought him to Ferrari in 1946. He temporarily quit the company to go back to Isotta Fraschini in March 1947 but returned to Ferrari at the beginning of 1948 where he designed large 3.3, 4.1 and 4.5 L displacement V12 family of engines (the \\"Lampredi engine\\") which first saw use in the 1950s 275 S, 275 F1, 340 F1 and 375 F1 race cars. Lampredi's engines were used as large naturally aspirated alternatives to the diminutive Gioacchino Colombo-designed V12s used in most Ferrari cars until that time. Especially after the failure of Colombo's supercharged engine in Formula One, Lampredi's design began to find favor in the company. Lampredi oversaw Ferrari's racing effort during its early success in 1952 and 1953. A Lampredi four cylinder engine in a Ferrari 500 TR (Testa Rossa) In 1951, Enzo Ferrari saw a good opportunity to make a competitive car for Formula Two racing. And the rules for Formula One made it possible that the Formula Two car could also be competitive in Formula One for two years, until new engine regulations came into effect in 1954.Ferrari 500, F1technical So, he suggested to Lampredi that he design a four cylinder racing engine. This Lampredi twin- cam four cylinder proved very successful in Formula Two, Formula One and sports racing cars. My Auutoworld - Ferrari history Lampredi's work at Ferrari ended permanently in 1955 when Ferrari bought Lancia's racing team and famed engine designer Vittorio Jano, formerly of Alfa Romeo. Though Lampredi's engine designs lived on in Ferrari road cars, Jano's V6 and V12 engines quickly replaced Lampredi's large V12s for racing use. After Ferrari, Lampredi went to Fiat, where he oversaw that company's engine design efforts until 1977. It was at Fiat where he designed the famous Fiat Twin-Cam and SOHC engines, which provided motive-force for most Fiat and Lancia automobiles for over 32 years. He was also made manager of Fiat's Abarth factory racing group from 1973 through 1982. He was responsible for designing the engine that allowed Fiat to allocate in the Brazilian market in 1976, the FIASA (acronym of Portuguese \\"Fiat Autom√≥veis S.A). That engine equipped the Fiat 147, direct derivation of the European Fiat 127 but exclusively Brazilian. That was a big impact for the Brazilian automotive industry, because the Fiat 147 was the first national vehicle to have transverse mounted engine with belt driven overhead camshaft. It was also the first engine made on a large scale to be powered by Ethanol. Then, in 1979 the Fiat 147 is known to be the world's first car sold on a large scale to be moved by Ethanol. The Engine went so successful, that Fiat re-used it with small changes in the original project until 2001 (25 years), when the FIASA was superseded by the FIRE engine, also a straight-four engine, but bi-fuelled (Ethanol and Gasoline) and much lighter.

These are the analog telecommunications standards that were introduced in the 1980s and continued until being replaced by 2G digital telecommunications. The main difference between the two mobile cellular systems (1G and 2G), is that the radio signals used by 1G networks are analog, while 2G networks are digital. Although both systems use digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the handsets) to the rest of the telephone system, the voice itself during a call is encoded to digital signals in 2G whereas 1G is only modulated to higher frequency, typically 150 MHz and up. The inherent advantages of digital technology over that of analog meant that 2G networks eventually replaced them everywhere. One such standard is Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT), used in Nordic countries, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Eastern Europe and Russia. Others include Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) used in North America and Australia, TACS (Total Access Communications System) in the United Kingdom, C-450 in West Germany, Portugal and South Africa, Radiocom 2000 in France, TMA in Spain, and RTMI in Italy.

(DDI) used the Japan Total Access Communications System (JTACS) standard. The antecedent to 1G technology is the mobile radio telephone.  History  The first commercially automated cellular network (the 1G generation) was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1979, initially in the metropolitan area of Tokyo. Within five years, the NTT network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan and became the first nationwide 1G network. In 1981, the NMT system simultaneously launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. NMT was the first mobile phone network to feature international roaming. In 1983, the first 1G network launched in the USA was Chicago-based Ameritech using the Motorola DynaTAC mobile phone. Several countries then followed in the early to mid-1980s including the UK, Mexico and Canada. As of 2018, a limited NMT service in Russia remains the only 1G cellular network still in operation.

Krishnadevaraya (Kannada: ‡≤ï‡≥É‡≤∑‡≥ç‡≤£‡≤¶‡≥á‡≤µ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤Ø) was a Telugu emperor of the Vijayanagara Empire who reigned from 1509‚Äì1529. He was the third ruler of the Tuluva Dynasty and is considered to be its greatest ruler.https://www.ancient- origins.net/history-famous-people/krishnadevaraya-kingly-diplomat-patron-arts- military-0010286 He possessed the largest empire in India after the decline of the Delhi Sultanate.Keay, John, India: A History, New York: Harper Collins, 2000, p.302 Presiding over the empire at its zenith, he is regarded as an icon by many Indians. Krishnadevaraya earned the titles Kannada Rajya Rama Ramana (lit, \\"Lord of the Kannada empire\\"), Andhra Bhoja (lit, \\"Andhra Scholar King\\") and Mooru Rayara Ganda (lit, \\"King of Three Kings\\"). He became the dominant ruler of the peninsula of India by defeating the Sultans of Bijapur, Golconda, the Bahmani Sultanate and the Gajapatis of Odisha, and was one of the most powerful Hindu rulers in India.Advanced Study in the History of Medieval India by Jl Mehta p.118 Indeed, when the Mughal Emperor Babur was taking stock of the potentates of north India, Krishnadevaraya was rated the most powerful and had the most extensive empire in the subcontinent. Portuguese travellers Domingo Paes and Fernao Nuniz also visited the Vijayanagara Empire during his reign. Travelogues indicate that the king was not only an able administrator but also an excellent general, leading from the front in battle and even attending to the wounded.On occasion, the king changed battle plans abruptly, turning a losing battle into victory.The south Indian poet Muku Timmana praised him as the destroyer of the Turkics.Vijayanagara Voices: Exploring South Indian History and Hindu Literature William Joseph Jackson: p.124 Krishnadevaraya benefited from the able prime minister Timmarusu, who was regarded by the emperor as a father figure and was responsible for his coronation. Early life Krishna Deva Raya was the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka,Prof K.A.N. Sastri, History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar, 1955, pp 250,258 an army commander under Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya, who later took control of the empire to prevent its disintegration and became the founder of the Tuluva Dynasty, the third Hindu Dynasty to rule Vijayanagara. Military career His main enemies were the Bahamani Sultans (who, though divided into five small kingdoms, remained a constant threat), the Gajapatis of Odisha, who had been involved in constant conflict since the rule of Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya and the Portuguese, a rising maritime power which controlled much of the sea trade. =Success in Deccan= The annual affair of the raid and plunder of Vijayanagar towns and villages by the Deccan sultans came to an end during the Raya's rule. In 1509, Krishnadevaraya's armies clashed with the Sultan Samshuddin Zafar Khan of Bijapur at Diwani and the Sultan Mahmud was severely injured and defeated. Yusuf Adil Shah was killed and the Raichur Doab was annexed. Taking advantage of the victory, the Raya reunited Bidar, Gulbarga, and Bijapur into Vijayanagar and earned the title \\"establisher of the Yavana kingdom\\" when he released Sultan Mahmud and made him de facto ruler. The Sultan of Golconda Sultan Quli Qutb Shah was defeated by Timmarusu, who was the prime minister of Sri Krishnadevaraya. =War with Feudatories= He defeated many local rulers like the Dharanikota Kammas, who were feudatory. =War with Kalinga= The Gajapatis of Odisha ruled a vast land comprising Andhra region, Odisha. Krishna Deva Raya's success at Ummatur provided the necessary impetus to carry his campaign into Coastal Andhra region which was in control of the Gajapati Raja Prataparudra Deva. The Vijayanagar army laid siege to the Udayagiri fort in 1512. The campaign lasted for a year before the Gajapati army disintegrated due to starvation. Krishna Deva Raya offered prayers at Tirupati thereafter along with his wives Tirumala Devi and Chinnama Devi. The Gajapati army was then met at Kondaveedu, where the armies of Vijayanagara, after establishing a siege for a few months, began to retreat due to heavy casualties. Then, Timmarusu, upon discovering a secret entrance to the unguarded eastern gate of the fort, launched a night attack that culminated with the capture of the fort and the imprisonment of Prince Virabhadra, the son of Gajapati Emperor Prataparudra Deva. Saluva Timmarusu took over as governor of Kondaveedu thereafter. Krishnadevaraya planned for an invasion of Kalinga, but the Gajapati Emperor, Prataparudra, was made privy to this plan. Prataparudra formulated his own plan to defeat Krishandevaraya and the Vijayanagara Empire. The confrontation was to happen at the fort of Kalinganagar. But the wily Timmarusu secured the information of Prataparudra's plan by bribing a Telugu deserter, who was formerly under the service of Prataparudra. When the Vijayanagara Empire did invade, Prataprudra was driven to Cuttack, the capital of the Gajapati empire. Prataparudra eventually surrendered to Vijayanagara Empire, and he gave his daughter, Princess Jaganmohini, in marriage to Sri Krishnadevaraya. Krishandevaraya returned all the lands that the Vijayanagara Empire captured to the North of the Krishna River; this made the Krishna river boundary between the Vijayanagar and the Gajapati Kingdoms. Krishnadevaraya established friendly relations with the Portuguese, who set up the Portuguese Dominion of India in Goa in 1510. The Emperor obtained guns and Arabian horses from the Portuguese merchants. He also utilized Portuguese expertise in improving water supply to Vijayanagara City. =Final conflict and death = Kannada inscription dated 1524 A.D., of Krishnadeva Raya at the Anathasayana temple in Anathasayanagudi near Hampi. The temple was built in memory of his deceased son The complicated alliances of the empire and the five Deccan sultanates meant that he was continually at war. In one of these campaigns, he defeated Golconda and captured its commander Madurul-Mulk, crushed Bijapur and its Sultan Ismail Adil Shah, and restored Bahmani sultanate to the son of Muhammad Shah II. The highlight of his conquests occurred on 19 May 1520 where he secured the fortress of Raichur from Ismail Adil Shah of Bijapur after a difficult siege during which 16,000 Vijayanagara soldiers were killed. The exploits of the military commander, Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayudu of the Pemmasani Nayaks, during the Battle of Raichur were distinguished and lauded by Krishnadevaraya.Tidings of the king : a translation and ethnohistorical analysis of the RƒÅyavƒÅcakamu.

It is said that 700,000-foot soldiers, 32,600 cavalry, and 550 elephants were used in the Battle of Raichur. Finally, in his last battle, he razed to the ground the fortress of Gulburga, the early capital of the Bahmani sultanate. His empire extended over the whole of South India. In 1524, Krishnadevaraya made his son Tirumala Raya the Yuvaraja (crown prince). The prince did not survive for long: he was poisoned to death. Suspecting the involvement of Timmarusu, Krishna Deva Raya had his trusted commander and adviser blinded. At the same time, Krishnadevaraya was preparing for an attack on Belgaum, which was in the Adil Shah's possession. Around this time, Krishnadevaraya took seriously ill. He died soon after in 1529. Before his death, he nominated his brother, Achyuta Deva Raya as his successor. Internal affairs During his reign he kept a strict control over his ministers, and any minister who committed misdeeds was dealt with severely.A Comprehensive History of India: Comprehensive history of medieval India by B.N. Puri, M.N. Das p.94 He abolished some of the obnoxious taxes such as the marriage fee. To increase revenues, he brought new lands under cultivation by ordering deforestation of some areas. A large-scale work to obtain water for irrigation around Vijayanagar was also undertaken by him.Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500 p.194History of Medieval India: From 1000 A.D. to 1707 A.D. by Radhey Shyam Chaurasia p.111 Foreign travelers, such as Paes, Nunez and Barbosa, who visited Vijayanagar spoke highly of the efficiency of administration and prosperity of the people during his reign. The administration of the empire was carried along the lines indicated in his Amuktamalyada. He was of the opinion that the King should always rule with an eye towards Dharma. His concern for the welfare of the people is amply proved by his extensive annual tours all over the empire, during which he studied everything personally and tried to redress the grievances of the people and to punish the evil doers. With regard to the promotion of the economic progress of his people, Krishnadevaraya says: \\"the extent of the kingdom is the means for the acquisition of wealth.Medieval Indian History by Krishnaji Nageshrao Chitnis p.82 Therefore even if the land is limited in extent, excavate tanks and canals and increase the prosperity of the poor by leasing him the land for low ari and koru, so that you may obtain wealth as well as religious merit.\\" Art and literature Vitthala temple with musical pillars, Hoysala style multigonal base Hampi The rule of Krishna Deva Raya was an age of prolific literature in many languages, although it is also known as a golden age of Kannada literature. Many Telugu, Kannada, Sanskrit, and Tamil poets enjoyed the patronage of the emperor. Emperor Krishna Deva Raya was fluent in many languages. There remains a debate whether he was a Kannadiga or Telugu http://www.hindu.com/2010/09/14/stories/2010091462650700.htm or Tuluva by lineage.http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/12/30/stories/2005123002710600.htm The poet Mukku Timma praised him as a great general and stated: \\"O Krishnaraya, you Man-Lion.

However, it is not yet clear if the record was written by the king himself. =Telugu literature= The rule of Krishna Deva Raya is known as golden age of Telugu literature. Eight Telugu poets were regarded as eight pillars of his literary assembly and known as Ashtadiggajas. Krishna Dev Raya himself composed an epic Telugu poem Amuktamalyada. During the reign of Krishnadevaraya Telugu culture and literature flourished and reached their heyday. The great emperor was himself a celebrated poet having composed Amuktamalyada. In his court, eight Telugu poets were regarded as the eight pillars of the literary assembly. In the olden days, it was believed that eight elephants were holding the earth in eight different directions. The title Ashtadiggajas celebrates this belief and hence the court was also called Bhuvana Vijayam (Conquest of the World). The period of the Empire is known as \\"Prabandha Period,\\" because of the quality of the prabandha literature produced during this time. Among these eight poets, Allasani Peddana is considered to be the greatest and is given the title of Andhra Kavita Pitamaha (the father of Telugu poetry). Svarocisha Sambhava or Manucharita is his popular prabandha work and was dedicated to Krishnadevaraya. Nandi Thimmana wrote Parijathapaharanam. Madayyagari Mallana wrote Rajasekhara Charitramu. Dhurjati wrote Kalahasti Mahatyamu and Ayyalaraju Ramabhadrudu wrote Sakalakatha Sangraha and Ramaabhyudayamu. Pingali Surana wrote Raghava Pandaviyamu, Kalapurnodayam, Prabhavate Pradyamana. Raghavapandaveeyamu is a dual work with double meaning built into the text, describing both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Kalapurnodayam(means full bloom of art) has been treated as the first original poetic novel in Telugu literature. Battumurthy alias Ramarajabhushanudu wrote Kavyalankarasangrahamu, Vasucharitra, Narasabhupaliyam and Harischandranalopakhyanamu. Among these works the last one is a dual work which tells simultaneously the story of King Harishchandra and Nala and Damayanti. Tenali Ramakrishna first wrote Udbhataradhya Charitramu, a Shaivite work. However, he converted to Vaishnavism later and wrote Vaishnava devotional texts Panduranga Mahatmyamu, and Ghatikachala Mahatmyamu. Tenali Rama remains one of the most popular folk figures in India today, a quick- witted courtier ready even to outwit the all-powerful emperor. Other well- known poets were Sankusala Nrisimha Kavi, who wrote KavikarnaRasayana, Chintalapudi Ellaya, who wrote Radhamadhavavilasa and Vishnumayavilasa, Molla, a poet wrote a version of Ramayana, Kamsali Rudraya wrote Nirankusopakhyana, and Addanki Gangadhara wrote Basavapurana. Manumanchi Bhatta wrote a scientific work called Hayalakshana Sastra. =Tamil literature= Tamil inscription of Krishnadevaraya, Severappoondi Krishna Deva Raya patronised the Tamil poet Haridasa, and Tamil literature soon began to flourish as the years passed by.Dr. S.U.

Since they were the predecessors of the first generation of cellular telephones, these systems are sometimes retroactively referred to as pre-cellular (or sometimes zero generation, that is, 0G) systems. Technologies used in pre-cellular systems included the Push to Talk (PTT or manual), Mobile Telephone Service (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS) systems. These early mobile telephone systems can be distinguished from earlier closed radiotelephone systems in that they were available as a commercial service that was part of the public switched telephone network, with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatch system. These mobile telephones were usually mounted in cars or trucks (thus called car phones), although briefcase models were also made. Typically, the transceiver (transmitter-receiver) was mounted in the vehicle trunk and attached to the \\"head\\" (dial, display, and handset) mounted near the driver seat. They were sold through WCCs (Wireline Common Carriers, a.k.a. telephone companies), RCCs (Radio Common Carriers), and two-way radio dealers.  Origins  Early examples for this technology: *Motorola, in conjunction with the Bell System, operated the first commercial mobile telephone service (MTS) in the US in 1946, as a service of the wireline telephone company. *The A-Netz launched 1952 in West Germany as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. * System 1 launch in 1959 in the United Kingdom, the 'Post Office South Lancashire Radiophone Service', covering South Lancashire and operated from a telephone exchange in Manchester is cited as the country's first mobile phone network.http://www.btplc.com/today/art91356.html However it was manual (needed to be connected via an operator) and with very little coverage for several decades. *First automatic system was the Bell System's IMTS which became available in 1964, offering automatic dialing to and from the mobile. *\\"Altai\\" mobile telephone system was launched into the experimental service in 1963 in the Soviet Union, becoming fully operational in 1965, a first automatic mobile phone system in Europe. *The Televerket opened its first manual mobile telephone system in Norway in 1966. Norway was later the first country in Europe to get an automatic mobile telephone system. *The Autoradiopuhelin (ARP) launched in 1971 in Finland as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network *The Automatizovan√Ω mƒõstsk√Ω radiotelefon (AMR) launched in 1978, fully operational in 1983, in Czechoslovakia as the first analog mobile radio telephone in the whole Eastern Bloc *The B-Netz launched 1972 in West Germany as the country's second public commercial mobile phone network (albeit the first one that did not require human operators to connect calls)  Radio Common Carrier  Parallel to Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) in the US until the rollout of cellular AMPS systems, a competing mobile telephone technology was called Radio Common Carrier or RCC. The service was provided from the 1960s until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete. These systems operated in a regulated environment in competition with the Bell System's MTS and IMTS. RCCs handled telephone calls and were operated by private companies and individuals. Some systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent RCCs to use their facilities but the universe of RCCs did not comply with any single interoperable technical standard (a capability called roaming in modern systems). For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraska-based RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. At the end of RCC's existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would potentially have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers. Roaming was not encouraged, in part because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile or handheld that a wired phone was trying to call them. Other systems used DTMF. Some used a system called Secode 2805 which transmitted an interrupted 2805 Hz tone (in a manner similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets, rotary or push- button dialing, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (which were radically advanced for their day). RCCs used paired UHF 454/459 MHz and VHF 152/158 MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS.

He began work as an apprentice to Vittorio Jano at Alfa Romeo. Ferrari 212 2.6 L engine In 1937, Colombo designed the 158 engine for the Alfetta and caught the attention of Enzo Ferrari. Ferrari asked Colombo to design a small V12 for use in the new Ferrari marque's racing and road cars. The first Ferrari-Colombo engine appeared on 11 May 1947. Colombo's great work for Ferrari was a tiny 1.5 litre V12, first used in the Tipo 125, 159, and then 166 sports cars. This engine, known in Ferrari circles as the \\"Colombo engine\\", was produced for road cars and endurance racing cars for more than 40 years in displacements up to 4.8 L. These included the 3.0 litre Ferrari 250 racing, sports, and GT cars. Colombo's engine was not as successful in Formula One racing. After stunning early success in the 166, the engine was supercharged for use in Formula One but failed to perform well. Ferrari hedged his bets, as he often did, by bringing on competing designer Aurelio Lampredi to create a large naturally aspirated V12, which replaced Colombo's. Later, Colombo's former mentor, Vittorio Jano, came to Ferrari and displaced the work of both men. Colombo left Ferrari in 1950 and returned to Alfa Romeo. Where, he oversaw the company's racing efforts, including the success that year of Nino Farina and, in 1951, Juan-Manuel Fangio. In 1953, Colombo turned to Maserati and created the 250F Grand Prix car. Two years later, Colombo headed to newly restarted Bugatti to work on the 251. He then worked for MV Agusta in 1957-1970.

It also was the first racing game from Konami. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively. A Japan-only rebooted sequel was also released in 2010, 14 years after Winding Heat. Ports and related releases NES version of Road Fighter. The game was later released for the MSX home computer system in 1985 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan (1985) and in Europe (1992), and followed the same format as the original. The game was included on Konami Arcade Classics in 1999 and on Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the Nintendo DS. The arcade game was released for i-mode phones in Japan in 2005. Road Fighter was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows- based PCs on March 24, 2010. Gameplay The first and second levels contain 4 courses, ranging from grassy plains to an over water bridge to a seashore, mountains and finally a forest area. In the arcade version, 6 stages were contained. Pressing the 'B' button raises the player's speed to around 196 km/h while pressing the 'A' button skyrockets the speed to 400. The player has a limited amount of fuel and can earn more by touching special multi-colored cars. If the player collides into any other car or slips on occasionally appearing patches of oil, the car will begin to spin out and if not corrected may crash into the side barriers, causing a loss of 5-6 fuel units. The NES and Famicom version have a total of 6 types of cars, 1 yellow and red, three blue and one truck. Yellow cars will travel along a straight line and occur in large numbers. Red cars are a little less likely to appear, but they will change the lane they are travelling in once to get in the way of the player. Blue cars vary in the way they change their lane. Trucks go on a straight way, but colliding with them causes the player to crash. Konami Man will make a cameo appearance, flying by the side of the road if the player progresses to a certain point in the level without crashing (not included on course 2 in NES and Famicom versions).  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Road Fighter on their January 1, 1985 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Konami GT Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 is the sequel to Road Fighter, released in arcades in March 1996, and on the PlayStation in 1997. While the arcade version was released worldwide, the PlayStation version was only released in Japan and Europe. In Europe, the PlayStation version is just titled Midnight Run, removing the Road Fighter connection. Its main selling point was that it allows the player to shift back and forth between manual and automatic transmission during races. Although different from the 2-D Road Fighter, the scenery is similar to other racing games set in Japan such as Initial D Arcade Stage and Wangan Midnight, except the cars are not licensed. The player also has a unique selection of normal cars and tuned cars. =Car list= *Honda NSX *Toyota Supra *Mazda RX-7 *Nissan Skyline GT-R *Porsche 911 (non-playable) *Mercedes-Benz SL500 (non-playable) =Reception= Reviewing the arcade version, Next Generation praised the support for up to four players, challenging AI, multiple tracks, ability to switch between manual and automatic mid-race, tight controls, powerslides, car selection, and generally fast-paced racing, but nonetheless concluded the game to be only slightly above average, and scored it three out of five stars. Winding Heat Winding Heat is the sequel to Road Fighter and Midnight Run, released in arcades in 1996. It first appeared in arcades in September, though most arcades did not receive their units until later. It is an improved version of Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2, though it has more of the normal or tuned cars, and the rules remain the same. Unlike Midnight Run, it takes place on touge roads. The cabinet came in two configurations: a sitdown version with a 50-inch monitor and an upright version with a 25-inch monitor. Cabinets can be linked to support up to four players. Road Fighters (2010) Road Fighters is the Japan-only sequel to the original Road Fighter, released in arcades in 2010. The game features 3D-enhanced graphics, with a mounted pair of goggles used to view the effect. Tracks are set in real-life locations and are all based on race courses from previous Konami racing titles, including Enthusia Professional Racing and the GTI Club series. The game includes numerous licensed vehicles, which can be saved using Konami's e-AMUSEMENT Pass containing tuning and customization data. This game is Konami's answer to Sega's Initial D Arcade Stage 4 and Namco's Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune in terms of card-based games, or Taito's Chase H.Q. 2 in terms of rebooted sequels. Its opening theme \\"Take Me Higher\\" was composed (together with the system music) by Sota Fujimori and it was included on beatmania IIDX 18 Resort Anthem as a playable song. In addition, the game includes music from beatmania IIDX and Dance Dance Revolution series, as a form to promote another Konami arcade games. =Game Modes= *Road Fighter Challenge - Basic Chase HQ-esque mode which offers the players visual upgrades and tuning points for cars. *National Online Match - Online multiplayer against a single opponent. Losers can request a rematch. Winners earn \\"game points,\\" which accumulate toward a ranking. Players who reach the top rank earn a medal.

However, if the player loses all of their medals, they are demoted to a lower rank. *Versus - Local multiplayer against up to three opponents (4-player). Players can use any of the cars on their e-Amusement Pass. *Time Attack - Basic time attack mode. Due to online connectivity, there are national leaderboards, visible in-game. *Event Mode - Special events held over a limited time period, updated through the internet.

St√∂lzel was an accomplished German stylist who wrote a good many of the poetic texts for his vocal works. Biography Melchior Hoffmann's 1707 Magnificat in A minor (BWV Anh. 21, formerly attributed to Bach): this copy was likely written by a young St√∂lzel.Hoffmann, Melchior: Magnificat in a-Moll at RISM website Sondershausen Palace and Market Square Schloss Friedenstein, St√∂lzel was born in Gr√ºnst√§dtel, in the Erzgebirge, on 13 January 1690. His father, organist in Gr√ºnst√§dtel, gave him his first music education. When he was thirteen, he was sent to study in Schneeberg, where he was taught music, including thoroughbass, by cantor Christian Umlaufft, a former student of Johann Kuhnau. A few years later he was admitted to the gymnasium in Gera, where he further practiced music under Emanuel Kegel, the director of the court chapel. Some of his educators took a dim view of music, and tried to divert his attention from it: apart from engaging in poetry and oratory, St√∂lzel nonetheless continued to develop his interest in music.Mattheson 1740Mizler 1754Melvin P. Unger, editor. \\"Introduction\\" pp. vii‚Äìxi of Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel ‚Äì German Te Deum: a setting of Martin Luther's translation. A-R Editions, 2010. In 1707 he became a student of theology in Leipzig. The city had a lot to offer from a musical point of view: its opera had been reopened shortly before, which St√∂lzel liked to visit. He became acquainted with Melchior Hoffmann, at the time music director of the Neukirche and conductor of the Collegium Musicum, both in succession of Georg Philipp Telemann, who had left Leipzig in 1705. Perfecting his art under Hoffmann, St√∂lzel also acted as his copyist, and started composing: initially Hoffmann performed these compositions as his own, St√∂lzel gradually coming to the open as their composer. In 1710 St√∂lzel went to Breslau in Silesia, where his first opera, Narcissus, on his own libretto, was performed in 1711. Returning to Halle after over two years in Silesia, he composed the operas Valeria, instigated by Johann Theile, for Naumburg, and Rosen und Dornen der Liebe for Gera. In 1713 he composed two further operas on his own librettos, Artemisia and Orion, both premiered in Naumburg.Narcissus at Late in 1713 he travelled to Italy, where he met composers like Johann David Heinichen and Antonio Vivaldi in Venice, Francesco Gasparini in Florence and Antonio Bononcini in Rome. Returning after more than a year, he spent some time in Innsbruck, and travelled over Linz to Prague where he worked for nearly three years (1715‚Äì17). In 1715 the post of Kapellmeister at the court of Schwarzburg- Sondershausen became vacant. St√∂lzel applied, but Prince Christian William I promoted Johann Balthasar Christian Frei√ülich, the court organist, to Kapellmeister in 1716. Court musicians such as Johann Christoph R√∂diger felt disappointed with their master's choice.Cantatas for Pentecost review of the 2002 recording by Johan van Veen, 2005 In Prague St√∂lzel premiered three more operas, several oratorios, masses, and many instrumental compositions. St√∂lzel was for a short time court Kapellmeister in Bayreuth (1717‚Äì18) and in Gera (1719). His opera Diomedes was premiered in 1718 in Bayreuth. St√∂lzel married with Christiana Dorothea Knauer on 25 May 1719. They had nine sons and one daughter. Three sons died at a young age. On 24 November 1719 St√∂lzel assumed the position of Kapellmeister at the court in Gotha, where he worked under the dukes Frederick II and Frederick III of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg until his death in 1749.Owens et al. 2011/2015, p. 203 St√∂lzel initiated several theoretical works about music, but only one of these was published during his lifetime: a treatise on the composition of canons, of which 400 copies were printed in 1725.Hiller 1784Gerber 1792Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel. Practischer Bewei√ü wie aus einem nach dem wahren Fundamente solcher Noten-K√ºnsteleyen gesetzten Canone perpetuo in hypo dia pente quatuor vocum viel und mancherley ... Canones perpetui √† 4 zu machen seyn. S.l., 1725 In 1720 Prince G√ºnther I succeeded his father in Sondershausen. He too regretted his father's choice for the court Kapellmeister. He asked St√∂lzel to provide music for the court chapel. St√∂lzel did however not comply to this request until 1730, when Frei√ülich was leaving for Danzig (where he was appointed in 1731). Until G√ºnther's death in 1740 St√∂lzel provided music for the Sondershausen court, which included four cycles of church cantatas, other sacred music, and secular music such as serenatas.Scheitler 2005, pp. 338‚Äì345 In 1739 St√∂lzel became a member of Lorenz Christoph Mizler's . As a member of this Society he composed a cantata and wrote a treatise on the recitative, which was published as Abhandlung vom Recitativ in the 20th century.Steger 1962 The last two years of his life St√∂lzel suffered from ill health, becoming feeble-minded (\\"im Haupte schwach\\"). Some of St√∂lzel's manuscripts were sold to cover expenses.Ahrens 2009 He died 27 November 1749, less than 60 years old. Mizler printed St√∂lzel's obituary as second of three (of which Johann Sebastian Bach's was the third), in the fourth volume of his ', the organ of the Society of Musical Sciences. Compositions Court chapel of Friedenstein Palace, where, from late 1719, most of St√∂lzel's sacred music was first performed Court chapel of Sondershausen Palace According to an 18th-century source St√∂lzel would have composed eight double cantata cycles. St√∂lzel composed twelve complete annual cycles of sacred cantatas, which amounts to 1,358 cantatas. 1,215 of these are at least partially extant, 605 surviving with music.Siegmund 2007 Additionally, St√∂lzel set cantatas to secular texts. Among his extant compositions are a Brockes Passion of 1725, two Christmas Oratorios, made of cantatas,St√∂lzel: Christmas Oratorio - Epistle Cantatas on ArkivMusik, review of David Vernier, 2005 and a Deutsche Messe (German Mass), a Lutheran Mass consisting of Kyrie and Gloria, in German, set for four-part choir, strings and basso continuo. Extant instrumental works include four concerti grossi, many sinfonias, and a concerto for oboe d'amore. He also wrote for organ and harpsichord. His five operas, Diomedes (1718), Narcissus, Valeria, Artemisia, and Orion, have not survived. St√∂lzel is reputed to have composed over 18 orchestral suites alone (none survive), as well as 90 serenatas (vocal pieces performed as \\"table music\\"). Half of St√∂lzel's output, never engraved, is lost. Out of what had to have been thousands of compositions in Gotha, only twelve manuscripts survive there today. The archive at Schloss Sondershausen retains many of his manuscripts, found in a box behind the organ in 1870. =Cantatas= In his catalogue published in 1976 Fritz Hennenberg numbered 442 of St√∂lzel's church cantatas and 27 of his secular cantatas as surviving with music. Hennenberg also numbered the cantata cycles, although some of his assumptions in that regard were later revised after further research. After the publication of Hennenberg's catalogue over 50 other extant church cantatas have been authenticated as St√∂lzel's.Hennenberg 1976 In the listing below Hennenberg (H., also HenS) numbers are indicated where available. H. numbers can be preceded by \\"KK\\" (for church cantatas), \\"WK\\" (secular cantatas) or \\"apokr.\\" (apocryphal composition with lyrics by St√∂lzel). \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" respectively indicate cantatas surviving with music, cantatas surviving by their libretto exclusively and cantatas only known by their title. If there is no indicator between the \\"H.\\" abbreviation and the number, then the number refers to a church cantata with extant music (e.g., H. 438 = ). Alternatively the sublist to which a cantata belongs can be indicated by a page number: e.g. = and = .Stoelzel catalogue at St√∂lzel, Gottfried Heinrich: Sei du mein Anfang und mein Ende at RISM websiteSt√∂lzel, Gottfried Heinrich: Kommt ihr frohen Morgenl√§nder at RISM website Church cantatas Shortly after assuming his office in Gotha St√∂lzel wrote a cycle of six Christmas cantatas.Owens et al. 2011/2015, p. 204 Year cycles of church cantatas include: * 1720‚Äì21: on a cycle of librettos by Johann Oswald Knauer, published as Gott-geheiligtes Singen und Spielen * Probably 1722‚Äì23: on librettos from Erdmann Neumeister's Neue Geistliche Gedichte * \\"Saitenspiel\\" (String-Music) cycle, thus named after Benjamin Schmolck's second libretto cycle, published in 1720, an \\"ideal cycle\\" containing 88 cantata texts. Schmolck provided more than one cantata text for some of the most important feasts. Schmolck's librettos have five sections: Aria, Recitative, Aria, Recitative and Aria. St√∂lzel split the librettos he used in two halves, adding a chorale from the hymnal used in Gotha as a conclusion of each half: thus the structure of his cantatas based on Schmolck's librettos became (Part I:) Aria ‚Äì Recitative ‚Äì Aria ‚Äì Chorale, and (Part II:) Recitative ‚Äì Aria ‚Äì Chorale. The cycle was performed in Zerbst (1724‚Äì25), after a presumed earlier performance of the cycle in Gotha.

Christmas cantatas of this cycle as oratorio: see below.Texte zu einem Weihnachts- Oratorium 1728 at From 1730 to 1745 St√∂lzel wrote six more cantata cycles, including:Owens et al. 2011/2015, p. 208 * 1731‚Äì32: \\"Namenbuch\\" (Namebook) double cantata cycle, consisting of 70 settings of librettos found in Schmolck's third cycle (published in 1726). The structure of these librettos is comparable to those of the \\"Meiningen\\" cycle published in 1704. Extant scores of the Namebook cycle indicate the cantatas were later performed in halves in Sondershausen (i.e. the first half having been performed in the morning, the second half in the afternoon). In addition to Schmolck's texts, St√∂lzel added a chorale as conclusion of the first part to each cantata. For 36 of these cantatas most of both halves survives, while for one of them (for Ascension) only the first half is extant. * 1732‚Äì33 and 1733‚Äì34: two single cycles * 1735‚Äì36: double cycle based on librettos from Johannes Caspar Manhardt's Erbauliche Kirchen-Andachten * 1737‚Äì38: St√∂lzel's 10th cycle, Musicalische Lob- und Danck-Opfer, was a single cycle based on his own librettos.St√∂lzel, Gottfried Heinrich: 51 Cantatas at RISM website * 1743‚Äì44: single cycle based on St√∂lzel's own librettos. Most of the sacred cantatas are for occasions of the liturgical year, although there are also church cantatas for other occasions such as birthday celebrations of his employer.St√∂lzel, Gottfried

According to the obituary published by Mizler St√∂lzel would have written around fourteen Passions and Christmas oratorios. St√∂lzel's librettos for his Passions and oratorios approach the cantata format: they are reflective in nature, and lack the dramatic-narrative component of, for instance, a sung Gospel reading. Passion oratorios premiered on Maundy Thursday and/or Good Friday: * Die leidende und am Creutz sterbende Liebe Jesu, also known by its incipit Ein L√§mmlein geht und tr√§gt die Schuld, in two sections for performance on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday (Gotha 1720, updated version 1730, and several repeat performances including likely in Sondershausen)St√∂lzel, Gottfried Heinrich: Ein L√§mmlein geht und tr√§gt die Schuld and St√∂lzel, Gottfried Heinrich: Ein L√§mmlein geht und tr√§gt die Schuld at RISM websiteDie leidende und am Creutze sterbende Liebe Jesu and Ein L√§mmlein geht und tr√§gt die Schuld at * 1723: Sechs Andachten, aus der von denen vier Evangelisten zusammen getragenen und mit Geistlichen Arien und Choralen untermischten Historie des bitteren Leidens und Sterbens unsers allertheuresten Erl√∂sers Jesu Christi, davon die ersten zwey am Gr√ºnen Donnerstage Nachmittage; die andern aber am Char-Freytage, in der Hoch-F√ºrstl.

Shortly after his death some of his compositions were still performed, and Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg rated him slightly above Bach in his list of prominent composers of the 18th century. By the 19th century he was largely forgotten.. Article in Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung. 1832, pp. 639f. From the second half of the 20th century there was an increase of musicological research about the composer, and recordings of his work. =Contemporaries= Before he settled in Gotha for the last thirty years of his life St√∂lzel had already seen his music performed from Germany to Italy. His operas had been staged in several major cities in the 1710s. His sacred music was performed from Catholic Prague to the Protestant German principalities. Even after his music production became concentrated on Gotha and Sondershausen, his music was still performed outside these places. One of his operas was performed in Altenburg in 1722, the Saitenspiel cantata cycle was performed under Johann Friedrich Fasch in Zerbst in 1724‚Äì25, and the first Passion he had composed for Gotha, and reworked around 1730, was taken up in several German cities: * Johann Sebastian Bach performed Ein L√§mmlein geht und tr√§gt die Schuld on Good Friday in Leipzig. * In 1736 the Passion was performed as Geistliche Und Heilige Betrachtungen der Gl√§ubigen Seele √ºber Ihren Leidenden und Sterbenden Jesum in Rudolstadt, and in a similar version (Der Glaubigen Seele geistliche Betrachtungen Ihres leidenden Jesu) in N√ºrnberg. Page 58r of the Klavierb√ºchlein f√ºr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, written by J. S. Bach, containing the end of St√∂lzel's Partia and Bach's complement to its last movement (BWV 929). Bach didn't only perform the work: around 1742‚Äì43 he reworked the aria \\"Dein Kreuz, o Br√§utgam meiner Seelen\\" from Die leidende und am Kreuz sterbende Liebe Jesu into Bekennen will ich seinen Namen, BWV 200.Bach Digital Work The music of this work had originally been believed to have been Bach's own.Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (1998), p. 202 Before that, Bach and his family had shown their interest in various genres of St√∂lzel's music: * Klavierb√ºchlein f√ºr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach: in the 1720s Bach copied a four-movement harpsichord suite Partia di Signore Steltzeln (Partita by Mr. St√∂lzel) as 48th piece in the Klavierb√ºchlein (keyboard-booklet) of his eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann, adding a Trio (BWV 929) of his own hand to its last movement, a Minuet.Alfred D√∂rffel, editor. BGA Vol. 451 (1897), pp. 213‚Äì231Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (1998), pp. 391‚Äì392Bach Digital Work * Possibly in the period 1732‚Äì35 Bach performed cantatas of St√∂lzel's Namebook cycle in Leipzig. * From the first Sunday after Trinity 1735 to Trinity Sunday the next year Bach probably performed St√∂lzel's entire String-Music cantata cycle in Leipzig's churches. Text booklets containing Schmolck's librettos and the chorales St√∂lzel had added to his settings of these librettos, were printed for the Leipzig church services in that period.Tatiana Shabalina \\"Recent Discoveries in St Petersburg and their Meaning for the Understanding of Bach‚Äôs Cantatas\\" pp. 77-99 in Understanding Bach 4, 2009 * Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach: some time after 1733‚Äì34 Anna Magdalena Bach noted \\"Bist du bei mir\\", BWV 508, based on the aria \\"Bist du bei mir geh ich mit Freuden\\" from St√∂lzel's opera Diomedes, in her notebook. For a long time the music of this aria was misattributed to her husband Johann Sebastian.Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (1998), pp. 308‚Äì309Bach-Jahrbuch 2002, pp. 172‚Äì174.Bach Digital Work Johann Mattheson reckoned St√∂lzel among \\"the level-headed, learned, and great music masters\\" of his century. Lorenz Christoph Mizler rated St√∂lzel as great as Johann Sebastian Bach. =Next generation= In 1761 Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel published St√∂lzel's Enharmonische Claviersonate (enharmonic keyboard sonata) in the second volume (13th instalment) of his . Georg Benda, St√∂lzel's immediate successor at the court in Gotha, restaged church music of his predecessor, sometimes with score revisions, until 1768: Passion settings and many cantatas such as the 1728‚Äì29 double cantata cycle (restaged in the liturgical years 1752‚Äì53, 1763‚Äì64 and 1765‚Äì66) were included in such repeat performances. St√∂lzel's legacy was however disintegrating through sales of manuscripts, which court musicians had continued after the composer's death. In 1778 Benda wrote: \\"... Only the best works of my predecessor, which could be used even today for church music, are saved, because already a long time ago I separated them from useless junk and kept them in my own house.\\"\\"Nur die besten Arbeiten meines Vorg√§ngers, von welchen man noch izt be√ø den Kirchen- Musiken einigen Gebrauch machen k√∂nnte, sind gerettet, weil ich solche schon vor langer Zeit von dem unbrauchbaren Wuste abgesondert und eigends in meinem Hause verwahrt habe.\\", quoted in Hennenberg 1976, p. 22 Through Benda's neglect manuscripts of St√∂lzel's works in Gotha were lost. In Sondershausen St√∂lzel's works were copied, performed and conserved. Surprisingly Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf did not list any church cantatas by St√∂lzel in his catalogues of 1761, 1764 and 1770. Johann Kirnberger considered St√∂lzel to be one of the greatest contrapuntists, and illustrated his Die Kunst des reinen Satzes with music by St√∂lzel. C. P. E. Bach adopted several movements of St√∂lzel's Sechs geistlichen Betrachtungen des leidenden und sterbenden Jesus in his 1771 Lukas-Passion and his 1772 Johannes-Passion pasticcios. After C. P. E. Bach's death in 1788 three of St√∂lzel's cantata cycles were found in his legacy.A. B. Marx. \\"2.

Los Altos, CA: The Packard Humanities Institute, 2007. Passion according to St. John : (1772) / Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach ; based on a setting by Georg Philipp Telemann ; incorporating music by Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel, Gottfried August Homilius, and Johann Sebastian Bach ; edited by Paul Corneilson at Reference works by Johann Adam Hiller (1784) and Ernst Ludwig Gerber (early 1790s) contain biographies of St√∂lzel. Hiller describes part of St√∂lzel's music production as \\"heard today and forgotten tomorrow\\": over-all light in spirit and, according to the standards of the time when these pieces originated, with pleasurable singing lines over a sparse instrumental accompaniment. Hiller qualifies St√∂lzel's choral music as full in texture and rich in harmony, and names the Canonic Mass in thirteen real voices and the German Te Deum as examples of St√∂lzel's accomplished style, fully mastering the composition of canons and fugues. Gerber largely repeats Hiller's biographical notes and judgement about St√∂lzel's music, adding descriptions of St√∂lzel's 1736 double cantata cycle and vocal chamber music, where the singing voice is treated as an instrumental part, in some passages rather an accompaniment than the leading voice. Gerber praises St√∂lzel for his art of composing recitatives and summarizes the content of the then still unpublished Abhandlung vom Recitative. =Manuscript conservation and publications= collected manuscripts of St√∂lzel's music, many of these ending up in the Berlin State Library.

There are four main Women's Aid Federations, one for each of the countries of the United Kingdom. Its aim is to end domestic violence against women and children. The charity works at both local and national levels to ensure women's safety from domestic violence and promotes policies and practices to prevent domestic violence. Women's Aid Federation of England is the sole national co-ordinating body for the England-wide network of over 370 local domestic violence organisations, providing over 500 refuges, outreach, advocacy and children's support services. Women's Aid campaigns for better legal protection and services and in partnership with its national network, runs public awareness and education campaigns. Any woman can stay at a refuge (and take their children) and proof of abuse is not needed to stay at a refuge. Women's Aid provides services through its publications and website, and runs a Freephone 24-Hour National Domestic Violence Helpline in partnership with Refuge. History =Origins= Women's Aid was set up as a national United Kingdom federation to co-ordinate almost 40 services that had been established over the country. It was originally known as the National Women's Aid Federation, before the launch of Scottish Women's Aid in 1976, and both Welsh Women's Aid and the Women's Aid Federation Northern Ireland in 1978. The first Women's Aid federation was set up in 1974, shortly after the founding of the first refuge for women experiencing domestic violence. The organisation provided practical and emotional support as part of a range of services to women and children experiencing violence.http://www.womensaid.org.uk/landing_page.asp?section=0001000100190004 The charity was instrumental in lobbying for the 1976 Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, and for having women and children at risk of domestic violence to count as homeless under the 1977 Housing Act. During the 1980s, Women's Aid established the first ever National Domestic Violence Helpline service to meet the increasing number of calls to Women's Aid national office. The Helpline not only provided help and support for abused women and children, as well as agency professionals seeking advice, it also became a national referral point for access to the national network of refuge and support services.http://www.womensaid.org.uk/landing_page.asp?section=00010001001900040003 The charity continued to lobby for greater consideration and support for women and children experiencing domestic violence. Through the 1990s, Women's Aid continued its lobbying work, as well as increasing its public campaigning. In 1994, the charity released the first ever domestic violence cinema advert, and supported the television soap opera Brookside in a long-running, high-profile storyline on a family affected by domestic violence. In 1999, Women's Aid launched the first comprehensive domestic violence website in the UK and The Gold Book, the first ever UK-wide public directory of local refuge and helpline services.http://www.womensaid.org.uk/landing_page.asp?section=00010001001900040002 Since 2000, Women's Aid has run a number of high-profile campaigns, continued its work lobbying government, and launched a number of educational resources aimed at schools and teachers to encourage the teaching of healthy relationships as a preventative measure against domestic violence.http://www.womensaid.org.uk/landing_page.asp?section=00010001001900040001 Katie Ghose was the CEO of Women's Aid, having started in July 2017. She took over the post from Polly Neate, and stepped down in February 2019, after complaints from a number of women groups after her public praise of UKIP. Research In 1978, Women's Aid carried out a study of 1,000 women living in refuges, in light of statistics demonstrating that 1 in 4 crimes in Scotland was 'wife assault.' This was the beginning of significant amounts of research performed by Women's Aid and a number of partners into issues around domestic violence, which has developed into the release of Women's Aid's 'Annual Survey of Members', which gives details of the services in England working to support women experiencing domestic violence, and the women who use them. Activities Women's Aid states that: :Domestic violence against women is a violation of women and children's human rights, that it is the result of an abuse of power and control, and that it is rooted in the historical status of women in the family and in society. Women and children have a right to live their lives free from all forms of violence and abuse, and society has a duty to recognise and defend this right. Women's Aid advocate for abused women and children in three main ways. Firstly, they aim to affect policy decisions and laws by working with local and national government. Secondly, they attempt to raise awareness of the problem of domestic violence by campaigning and running websites such as The Hideout. Thirdly, they provide services to abused women and children, for example UKROL and the National Domestic Violence Helpline.

It combines the effects of the van der Waals attraction and the electrostatic repulsion due to the so-called double layer of counterions. The electrostatic part of the DLVO interaction is computed in the mean field approximation in the limit of low surface potentials - that is when the potential energy of an elementary charge on the surface is much smaller than the thermal energy scale, k_{rm B} T. For two spheres of radius a each having a charge Z (expressed in units of the elementary charge) separated by a center-to-center distance r in a fluid of dielectric constant epsilon_r containing a concentration n of monovalent ions, the electrostatic potential takes the form of a screened-Coulomb or Yukawa potential, : beta U(r) = Z^2 lambda_{rm B} , left(frac{e^{kappa a}}{1 + kappa a}right)^2 , frac{e^{-kappa r}}{r}, where lambda_{rm B} is the Bjerrum length, kappa^{-1} is the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel screening length, which is given by kappa^2 = 4 pi lambda_{rm B} n, and beta^{-1} = k_{rm B} T is the thermal energy scale at absolute temperature T.  Overview  DLVO theory is a theory of colloidal dispersion stability in which zeta potential is used to explain that as two particles approach one another their ionic atmospheres begin to overlap and a repulsion force is developed. In this theory, two forces are considered to impact on colloidal stability: Van der Waals forces and electric double layer forces. The total potential energy is described as the sum of the attraction potential and the repulsion potential. When two particles approach each other, electrostatic repulsion increases and the interference between their electrical double layers increases. Meanwhile, the Van der Waals attraction increases as they get closer. At each distance, the net potential energy of the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value. The combination of these forces results in a deep attractive well, which is referred to as the primary minimum. At larger distances, the energy profile goes through a maximum, or energy barrier, and subsequently passes through a shallow minimum, which is referred to as the secondary minimum. At the maximum of the energy barrier, repulsion is greater than attraction. Particles rebound after interparticle contact, and remain dispersed throughout the medium. The maximum energy needs to be greater than the thermal energy. Otherwise, particles will aggregate due to the attraction potential. The height of the barrier indicates how stable the system is. Since particles have to overcome this barrier in order to aggregate, two particles on a collision course must have sufficient kinetic energy due to their velocity and mass. If the barrier is cleared, then the net interaction is all attractive, and as a result the particles aggregate. This inner region is often referred to as an energy trap since the colloids can be considered to be trapped together by Van der Waals forces. For a colloidal system, the thermodynamic equilibrium state may be reached when the particles are in deep primary minimum. At primary minimum, attractive forces overpower the repulsive forces at low molecular distances. Particles coagulate and this process is not reversible. However, when the maximum energy barrier is too high to overcome, the colloid particles may stay in the secondary minimum, where particles are held together weaker than the primary minimum. Particles form weak attractions but are easily redispersed. Thus, the adhesion at secondary minimum can be reversible. History In 1923, Debye and H√ºckel reported the first successful theory for the distribution of charges in ionic solutions. . The framework of linearized Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory subsequently was applied to colloidal dispersions by Levine and Dube . . who found that charged colloidal particles should experience a strong medium-range repulsion and a weaker long-range attraction. This theory did not explain the observed instability of colloidal dispersions against irreversible aggregation in solutions of high ionic strength. In 1941, Derjaguin and Landau introduced a theory for the stability of colloidal dispersions that invoked a fundamental instability driven by strong but short- ranged van der Waals attractions countered by the stabilizing influence of electrostatic repulsions. . Seven years later, Verwey and Overbeek independently arrived at the same result. . This so-called DLVO theory resolved the failure of the Levine‚ÄìDube theory to account for the dependence of colloidal dispersions' stability on the ionic strength of the electrolyte. . Derivation DLVO theory is the combined effect of van der Waals and double layer force. For the derivation, different conditions must be taken into account and different equations can be obtained.M. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. A. Williams, Particle Deposition and Aggregation Measurement: Modelling and Simulation (Boston: 1995). But some useful assumptions can effectively simplify the process, which are suitable for ordinary conditions. The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together. =van der Waals attraction= van der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole- dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces,Jacob N. Israelacvili, Intermolecular and Surface Forces (London 2007). in which dispersion forces are the most important part because they are always present. Assume that the pair potential between two atoms or small molecules is purely attractive and of the form w = -C/rn, where C is a constant for interaction energy, decided by the molecule's property and n = 6 for van der Waals attraction.London, F. (1937), Trans Faraday Soc, 33, 8‚Äì26. With another assumption of additivity, the net interaction energy between a molecule and planar surface made up of like molecules will be the sum of the interaction energy between the molecule and every molecule in the surface body. So the net interaction energy for a molecule at a distance D away from the surface will therefore be : w(D) = -2 pi , C rho _1, int_{z=D}^{z= infty ,}dz int_{x=0}^{x=infty ,}frac{xdx}{(z^2+x^2)^3} = frac{2 pi C rho _1}{4}int_D^{infty }frac{dz}{z^4} = - frac{ pi C rho _1 }{ 6 D^3 } where **w(r) is the interaction energy between the molecule and the surface ** rho_1 is the number density of the surface. **z is the axis perpendicular with the surface and passes across the molecule. z = D at the point where the molecule is and z = 0 at the surface. **x is the axis perpendicular with z axis, where x = 0 at the intersection. Then the interaction energy of a large sphere of radius R and a flat surface can be calculated as : W(D) = -frac{2 pi C rho _1 rho _2}{12} int_{z=0}^{z=2R}frac {(2R-z)zdz}{(D+z)^3} approx -frac{ pi ^2 C rho _1 rho _2 R}{6D} where ** W(D) is the interaction energy between the sphere and the surface. ** rho_2 is the number density of the sphere For convenience, Hamaker constant A is given as : A = pi^2Crho_1rho_2 and the equation will become : W(D)=-frac{AR}{6D} With a similar method and according to Derjaguin approximation,Derjaguin B. V. (1934)Kolloid Zeits 69, 155‚Äì164. the van der Waals interaction energy between particles with different shapes can be calculated, such as energy between : two spheres: W(D) = -frac{A}{6D} frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1 +R_2 )} : sphere- surface: W(D) = -frac{AR}{6D} : Two surfaces: W(D) = -frac{A}{12 pi D^2} per unit area =Double layer force= A surface in a liquid may be charged by dissociation of surface groups (e.g. silanol groups for glass or silica surfaces Behrens, S. H. and Grier, D. G., \\"The charge on glass and silica surfaces,\\" Journal of Chemical Physics 115, 6716‚Äì6721 (2001) ) or by adsorption of charged molecules such as polyelectrolyte from the surrounding solution. This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced counterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the Gibbs free energy of EDL formation. The thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the Debye screening length 1/kappa. At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall. : kappa = sqrt{sum_i frac{rho_{infty i} e^2z^2_i}{epsilon_r epsilon_0 k_{rm B} T}} with unit of m‚àí1 where *rho_{infty i} is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution. *z is the valency of the ion. For example, H+ has a valency of +1 and Ca2+ has a valency of +2. *varepsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity, epsilon_r is the relative static permittivity. *kB is the Boltzmann constant. The repulsive free energy per unit area between two planar surfaces is shown as : W = frac{64k_{rm B} Trho_{infty } gamma ^2}{kappa}e^{-kappa D} where *gamma is the reduced surface potential gamma =tanhleft(frac{zepsi_0}{4k_{rm B}T}right) *psi_0 is the potential on the surface. The interaction free energy between two spheres of radius R is : W = frac{64pi k_{rm B} TRrho_{infty} gamma ^2}{kappa ^2}e^{-kappa D} . Combining the van der Waals interaction energy and the double layer interaction energy, the interaction between two particles or two surfaces in a liquid can be expressed as: : Wleft(Dright) = W(D)_A + W(D)_R , where W(D)R is the repulsive interaction energy due to electric repulsion and W(D)A is the attractive interaction energy due to van der Waals interaction. Effect of shear flows The DLVO theory of colloidal stability has been extended to take into account the effect of shear flow in fluid dynamic systems, which is relevant for many applications e.g. microfluidics, chemical reactors, atmospheric and environmental flows, in the work of Alessio Zaccone and collaborators. In this extended DLVO theory for sheared systems, the DLVO energy barrier for aggregation gets reduced by a negative contribution which is proportional to the P√©clet number of the particles, i.e. proportional to the shear rate, to the viscosity of the medium, and to the cube of the colloidal particle size, while the proportionality coefficient depends on the flow geometry. This result is obtained from an approximate solution to the governing Smoluchowski convection-diffusion equation obtained via the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The theory explains a characteristic lag- time in the shear-induced aggregation of the particles, which decreases exponentially with the shear rate. It also explains the subsequent runaway (autocatalytic) regime of aggregation kinetics after the lag-time, as well as the characteristic bimodal cluster size distribution of aggregates found typically in shear-induced aggregating and self-assembling systems. Furthermore, the theory has been verified across widely different flow conditions, in terms of different particles and microfluidic systems, and viscoelastic properties of the liquid phase. Application Since the 1940s, the DLVO theory has been used to explain phenomena found in colloidal science, adsorption and many other fields. Due to the more recent popularity of nanoparticle research, DLVO theory has become even more popular because it can be used to explain behavior of both material nanoparticles such as fullerene particles and microorganisms. Shortcomings Additional forces beyond the DLVO construct have been reported to also play a major role in determining colloid stability. DLVO theory is not effective in describing ordering processes such as the evolution of colloidal crystals in dilute dispersions with low salt concentrations. It also can not explain the relation between the formation of colloidal crystals and salt concentrations. N. Ise and I. S.

It is prepared by soaking broken-up stale bread in a broth prepared from offal, the resulting mixture then being seasoned with ground pepper and onion. Further refinements include the addition of various types of cheese and yogurt - as recorded in certain Hatay cookery books.What is Tirit?

Tirit sometimes features also in the cuisine of Mecca, where the story is told that the morale of a community hungry from famine brought about by a drought was boosted by being sustained by this dish until the return of times of greater plenty. The origins of Tirit can be traced back centuries to cooking techniques practiced on the steppes of Central Asia, where similar dishes were prepared using lamb and leftovers of various kinds - often including stale bread - re. which see also kuurdak. Khash is a similar frugal and sustaining offal-based dish eaten in many countries in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, including the southern Caucasus. Edelstein, Sari (2009). Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals. Jones & Bartlett Learning. p. 236. . The practice of creating a tasty dish by eking-out inexpensive offal with even cheaper forms of starch may also be observed in the preparation of haggis and the simpler forms of white pudding, in which the northern staple oatmeal fulfills the function of the stale bread used to make tirit. The forms of tirit involving cheese also bear some comparison to the barley-based, Tibetan staple Tsampa.

History Wales has one of the earliest literary traditions in Northern Europe, stretching back to the days of Aneirin (fl. 550) and Taliesin (second half of the 6th century), and the haunting Stafell Cynddylan, which is the oldest recorded literary work by a woman in northern Europe. The 9th century Canu Llywarch Hen and Canu Heledd are both associated with the earlier prince Llywarch Hen. Welsh poetry is connected directly to the bardic tradition, and is historically divided into four periods.Loesch, K. T. (1983). Welsh bardic poetry and performance in the middle ages. In D. W. Thompson (Ed.), Performance of Literature in Historical Perspectives (177‚Äì190). Lanham, MD: University Press of America. The first period, before 1100, is known as the period of Y Cynfeirdd (\\"The earliest poets\\") or Yr Hengerdd (\\"The old poetry\\"). It roughly dates from the emergence of the Welsh language from Common Brittonic in the sixth century to the arrival of the Normans in Wales towards 1100. The second period, the period of the \\"Poets of the Princes\\" (Beirdd y Tywysogion, also called Y Gogynfeirdd), lasted from about 1100 until 1350, or until 1282, the date of the overthrow of Llywelyn. The final classical period of Welsh poetry, referred to as the period of the Poets of the Nobility (Beirdd yr Uchelwyr) or simply Cywyddwyr, lasted from 1350 to 1600. These included Dafydd ap Gwilym and Iolo Goch, and they produced many cywyddau. There was a lull in the production of poetry after the union with England in the 16th century. The year 1600 is generally taken to mark the beginning of modern Welsh poetry. Throughout this time, serving as a bard was one of the few ways that one might better oneself socially, by becoming either a chief poet or a household poet. Both of these categories of bards could achieve status through a grading system, with the lowest being a minstrel (who was technically an ungraded bard), the lowest graded status of a disciple, a graduated disciple of poetry, a disciplined disciple, a disciple of chief- poet-craft, and finally a chief poet.Parry, T. (1929). Statud Gruffudd ap Cynan. Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies, 5(1), 29-33. The earliest poem in English by a Welsh poet dates from about 1470. More recently, Anglo-Welsh poetry has become an important aspect of Welsh literary culture, as well as influencing English literature. The works of the great hymn writers of the 18th and 19th centuries are also poetic: in particular William Williams Pantycelyn and Ann Griffiths. Around 1900, there was a renaissance with poets such as T. Gwynn Jones. Other notable writers were T. H. Parry-Williams and D. Gwenallt Jones; and around 1950 others such as Waldo Williams. Many poets in the late 20th century produced work of a high standard, many of them in cynghanedd. Welsh poets often write under bardic names to conceal their identity in Eisteddfod competitions.

It was developed by German studio Cyparade, published by Atari and first released in Europe on 2 April 2004. The gameplay is similar to Marble Madness: the player controls a ball via mouse and keyboard, moving it along a course while trying not to fall off the screen. Gameplay Screenshot from level 6 In the game, the player can change the ball's material with special transformers throughout the game's 13 levels (12 levels originally; another downloadable level, level 13 \\"Speed\\", is available on the developer's homepage). It can be transformed into a wood, stone, or paper ball. The wooden ball is very stable and can be used for several puzzles in the game. The player initially launches into and leaves all levels with a wooden ball. The stone ball is extremely heavy, and can be accidentally rolled off an edge very easily, but this ball can easily push down boxes and bridges. Furthermore, rolling a stone ball through a bridge made of planks will make the bridge collapse. The paper ball is very light. Its surface is not smooth, unlike the wooden and stone balls, and so its movement is slightly variable. A paper ball can be blown into the air by ventilators and can roll up steep hills easily. Two power-ups are available. If the ball rolls into them they provide either an extra ball or extra points. Checkpoints are scattered evenly across levels so that if a player falls off the course they only have to restart the game from the last checkpoint reached. There are 12 different levels. As the player navigates the ball along a path each become more difficult than the last. On occasion, the player has to push other balls down holes or onto rails to continue rolling along the path. Each level requires the player to complete physical challenges, which often have more than one puzzle to solve. The side-rail is introduced in level 3. The player's ball needs to roll on its side along two rails which are aligned vertically one above the other. In level 12, the player's ball has to balance on the center of the mono-rail, which composed of only one rail. An additional level 13 called \\"Speed\\" and located in Twilight Zone was available for free on the developer's homepage a few months after the release of the game. Reception An Adrenaline Vault review by Bob Mandel described the game's graphics as \\"heavenly\\", particularly admiring the \\"exquisite detail\\". Mandel thought the sounds were \\"absolutely outstanding\\", enjoyed the music and thought the gameplay was exciting and intense.

Vittorio Jano (; 22 April 1891 - 13 March 1965) was an Italian automobile designer of Hungarian descent from the 1920s through 1960s. Jano was born Viktor J√°nos in San Giorgio Canavese, in Piedmont, to Hungarian immigrants, who arrived there several years earlier. He began at the car and truck company Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid owned by G.B. Ceirano. In 1911 he moved to Fiat under Luigi Bazzi. He moved with Bazzi to Alfa Romeo in 1923 to replace Giuseppe Merosi as chief engineer. At Alfa Romeo his first design was the 8-cylinder in-line mounted P2 Grand Prix car, which won Alfa Romeo the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. In 1932, he produced the sensational P3 model which later was raced with great success by Enzo Ferrari when he began Scuderia Ferrari in 1933. For Alfa road cars Jano developed a series of small-to-medium-displacement 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder inline power plants based on the P2 unit that established the classic architecture of Alfa engines, with light alloy construction, hemispherical combustion chambers, centrally located plugs, two rows of overhead valves per cylinder bank and dual overhead cams. In 1936 he designed the Alfa Romeo 12C using a V12 engine. The car was not successful and this is given as the reason for Vittorio Jano's resignation from Alfa Romeo at the end of 1937. That same year, Jano moved to Lancia. Among his designs at Lancia was the Grand Prix effort. The car, the Lancia D50, was introduced in 1954, but 1955's loss of Alberto Ascari and the 1955 Le Mans disaster soured the company on GP racing. Ferrari took over the effort and inherited Jano that same year. Jano's contribution to Ferrari was significant. Immediately he began work on new V12 engine to replace existing inline-4-engined sports cars. In 1956 his new Jano V12 engine was introduced in the Ferrari 290 MM. New series of the Jano- engined sports cars helped secure two World Sportscar Championship titles. With the encouragement of Enzo's son, Alfredo, the Jano's V6 engines pushed the bigger Lampredi and Colombo engines aside in some races. After Dino's death, Jano's \\"Dino\\" V6 became the basis for the company's Formula Two and Tasman Series efforts. Later, with experience in both Ferrari and Dino mid- engine sports prototypes it laid a groundwork for their first mid-engined road car, the 1967 Dino 206 GT. The V6 and V8 went on to displace Ferrari's V12 focus and their descendants continue to be used today. Like Enzo Ferrari, Jano lost his own son in 1965. He became gravely ill that same year and committed suicide in Turin. Image:Vittorio Jano.jpgVittorio Jano, on the far right, with drivers Luigi Villoresi, Alberto Ascari and Eugenio Castellotti.

Details Mullun was born in Portland, Oregon, and his parents brought him to Moosomin, Saskatchewan at the age of two. He enlisted in the Army in December 1914. Action He was 26 years old, and a sergeant in Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 30 October 1917 at Passchendaele, Belgium, Sergeant Mullin single-handed captured a pill-box which had withstood heavy bombardment and was causing heavy casualties and holding up the attack. He rushed the snipers' post in front, destroyed the garrison with bombs, shot two gunners and then compelled the remaining 10 men to surrender. All the time rapid fire was directed on him and his clothes were riddled with bullets, but he never faltered in his purpose and he not only helped to save the situation but indirectly saved many lives. =Citation= The citation reads: Further Information Mullin had earlier received the Military Medal and finished the war as a lieutenant. In 1934 he was appointed as Sergeant at Arms of the Saskatchewan legislature. Mullin served as a captain in the Veterans Guard during the Second World War.

It was passed by Congress and set goals, created mandates, and amended utility laws to increase clean energy use and improve overall energy efficiency in the United States. The Act consists of twenty-seven titles detailing various measures designed to lessen the nation's dependence on imported energy, provide incentives for clean and renewable energy, and promote energy conservation in buildings. Amendment of prior energy acts It reformed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) to help small utility companies stay competitive with larger utilities and amended the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, broadening the range of resource choices for utility companies and outlined new rate-making standards. It also amended parts of the Federal Power Act of 1935 (Title VII). Titles The act addressed: *energy efficiency, energy conservation and energy management (Title I), *natural gas imports and exports (Title II), *alternative fuels and requiring certain fleets to acquire alternative fuel vehicles, which are capable of operating on nonpetroleum fuels (Title III-V), *electric motor vehicles (Title VI), *radioactive waste (Title VIII), *coal power and clean coal (Title XIII), *renewable energy (Title XII), *and other issues. =Title I--energy efficiency= Title I established a comprehensive energy efficiency program that included incentives for energy conservation in buildings and created efficiency standards for appliances. The EPAct directed the federal government to decrease energy consumption in federal buildings when feasible, and to integrate the use of alternative fuel vehicles in federal and state fleets. There are separate sections dedicated to coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy detailing clean energy incentives, research & development strategies, conservation goals, and responsible management practices. Energy efficiency provisions *Buildings - Requires states to establish minimum commercial building energy codes and to consider minimum residential codes based on current voluntary codes. This gave impetus to the creation and modification of ASHRAE 90.1/1999, 2001, ASHRAE 90.2, the Model Energy Code etc. *Utilities - Requires states to consider new regulatory standards that would require utilities to undertake integrated resource planning; allow the energy efficiency programs to be at least as profitable as new supply options; and encourage improvements in supply system efficiency. *Equipment Standards - Establishes efficiency standards for: Commercial heating and air-conditioning equipment; electric motors; and lamps. *Renewable Energy - Establishes a program for providing federal support on a competitive basis for renewable energy technologies *Alternative Fuels *Electric Vehicles *Electricity - Removes obstacles to wholesale power competition in the Public Utilities Holding Company Act (PUHCA). = TITLE III--alternative fuels = Title III of the 1992 Energy Policy Act addresses alternative fuels. It gave the U.S. Department of Energy administrative power to regulate the minimum number of light duty alternative fuel vehicles required in certain federal fleets beginning in fiscal year 1993. Title III includes: *Federal Fleet Requirements. *State and Alternative Fuel Provider Rule. *Private and Local Government Fleet Rule. *Alternative Fuel Designation Authority. = TITLE VI-- electric motor vehicles = The United States Department of Energy, which has EPACT92 implementation authority, ruled that diesel-electric or gasoline- electric hybrids are not \\"alternative fuel vehicles.\\" http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/datatables/atf14-20_05.html =Title VIII--radioactive waste= Section 801 directed the United States Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate radiation protection standards for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which had been designated by the Federal government to serve as the permanent disposal site for used nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials from commercial nuclear power plants and U.S. Department of Defense activities. =Title XII--renewable energy= Title XXII in the EPAct authorized tax incentives and marketing strategies for renewable energy technologies in an effort to encourage commercial sales and production.

His highly technical playing is extremely accurate at very high and challenging tempos, earning him the nicknames \\"The Atomic Clock\\" and \\"Human Drum Machine\\". He is best known for his work with Dark Angel, Death, Strapping Young Lad, Devin Townsend, Fear Factory, Dethklok and Testament. Hoglan completed work on Dethklok's fourth album The Doomstar Requiem, which was released in October 2013. He released the highly successful Gene Hoglan: The Atomic Clock DVD, and rejoined Testament to record the drum tracks for their tenth album, Dark Roots of Earth, released in July 2012. Hoglan was featured on the cover of Modern Drummer magazine November 2010. He also won Terrorizer magazine's Reader's Poll for Best Drummer 2010, and Modern Drummer magazine nominated Hoglan for Best Metal Drummer, and Best Recorded Performance (for Dethklok's Dethalbum II) on their 2011 ballot. He was nominated for Best Drummer in Revolver magazine's 2010 Reader's Poll. Biography Hoglan got his first drum kit when he was 13 and is completely self-taught. He started jamming along to his Kiss and Rush records, with Peter Criss and Neil Peart being his early influences. Later Cozy Powell, Tommy Aldridge, Robb Reiner of Anvil, Rob \\"Wacko\\" Hunter of Raven and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor got him into double bass drumming. Other influences include Stevie Wonder, Alex Van Halen, Steve Smith, Deen Castronovo, Mark Craney, Terry Bozzio, Bill Bruford, Steve Gadd, Sonny Emory, Rick Colaluca of Watchtower, Bobby Jarzombek, Dave Culross. In 1983, Hoglan began his music career as a roadie (lighting engineer) for the thrash metal band Slayer, where he also played the drums during concert soundchecks. He also did backing vocals on the song \\"Evil Has No Boundaries\\", from the first Slayer album Show No Mercy. He contributed in the recording of Haunting the Chapel, holding Dave Lombardo's drum kit together while recording \\"Chemical Warfare\\" because there was no carpet in the studio, said drum kit including a china cymbal owned by Hoglan. He became an influence in Lombardo's drumming style and speed. Lombardo had just had the double bass added to his kit and it was the first double bass Hoglan ever played. Lombardo was impressed with Hoglan's playing, and Hoglan gave Lombardo tips regarding the use of the double kick drum. In 1984, Hoglan was part of the band War God with Michelle Meldrum. At the end of the same year he was asked to join the thrash metal band Dark Angel as the drummer. He penned most of the lyrics for Dark Angel's next three albums. He achieved greater fame during the mid-1990s playing with Death, at the same time that bandleader Chuck Schuldiner was taking that group into a more progressive style. Subsequently, he recorded one album with the thrash metal band Testament, and made the acquaintance of Canadian multi-instrumentalist Devin Townsend, forging a lasting friendship. He has since recorded several albums with Townsend, both as part of the speed/industrial/death metal band Strapping Young Lad and under Devin Townsend's name. Hoglan was also part of thrash metal band Tenet, a side project of Strapping Young Lad guitarist Jed Simon, from 2003 to 2007. Hoglan left the band on amicable terms in January 2007. He was replaced by Adrian Erlandsson only to return to the group in June of the same year. Hoglan recorded his drum parts for the entirety of the following album in a mere two days. On the Vancouver stop of Opeth's 2004 Lamentations tour, Hoglan stood in for drummer Martin Lopez, who was said to be having panic attacks.\\"Blabbermouth.net - April, 2006 - OPETH Mainman: We Don't Know If Drummer MARTIN LOPEZ Is Ever Coming Back\\" April 11, 2006 Opeth's drum tech had filled in for the two previous dates on the tour and Lopez rejoined the band for the Seattle, Washington, show. Hoglan at the upright In 2005, Hoglan stood in for Lopez for the majority of the Sounds of the Underground tour when Lopez began having more panic attacks. Hoglan played double duty by playing a set with Strapping Young Lad then performing with Opeth later in the evening. It was later announced Lopez had a rare blood disorder and was seeking treatment. Hoglan also appeared in Opeth's music video \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" as they filmed it on the tour while in Los Angeles, California. Other bands have also recruited Hoglan as a session drummer. He has recorded albums with the Norwegian black metal band Old Man's Child and the Danish death metal band Daemon. Additionally he has done production and engineering work for other albums and demos. Hoglan also was recruited by Vancouver thrash metal band The Almighty Punchdrunk, and appeared as a band member for their only album to date, Music for Them Asses, released in 2001. Hoglan is working with Dethklok, the band from the animated TV show Metalocalypse. The show was co-created by stand-up comedian/actor/musician Brendon Small, who also composes or performs all of the music. Hoglan features in Dethklok's debut album, The Dethalbum, which was released on September 25, 2007.\\"STRAPPING YOUNG LAD's GENE HOGLAN Laying Down Tracks For DETHKLOK Album\\" December 23, 2006. He toured with Brendon Small and the live band during the summer of 2008. Besides working with Dethklok, Hoglan is also a guest star by voicing a health inspector in one episode of the series. He later performed on Dethalbum II, the sequel album released on September 29, 2009, and again toured with Dethklok. The two later collaborated to make Brendon Small's Galaktikon using extra studio time from the Dethklok studio sessions. Hoglan filled in as the drummer for Unearth when their then drummer, Mike Justian, quit while on tour. He has also joined the metal band Pitch Black Forecast, with Mushroomhead singer Jason Popson, as the band's permanent drummer. Even more recently, Hoglan was announced as the drummer for the reunited Bay Area Thrash metal band Forbidden's reunion tour, replacing original drummer Paul Bostaph. Hoglan played drums on Zimmers Hole's third studio album When You Were Shouting at the Devil...We Were in League With Satan in 2008. Gene Hoglan with Testament at Ruhrpott Metal Meeting 2017 In June 2011, he reunited with Testament, to record their tenth studio album Dark Roots of Earth. On that album, he filled in for Paul Bostaph, who was unable to participate in the recording sessions because of a \\"serious injury\\". In 2012, he began touring with Testament, and on January 27 filled in for Charlie Benante of Anthrax. Gene was the drummer for Fear Factory from 2009 to 2012 and played on their release Mechanize; his association with the band ended when he was \\"no longer needed\\", and he expressed both a reluctance to join and a disappointment in the ultimate resolution of his tenure.https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gene-hoglan-found-out-via- blabbermouth-net-that-he-was-no-longer-needed-by-fear-factory/ He also participated in the recording sessions of Viking's reunion album, No Child Left Behind (2015). In October 2013, it was announced that Hoglan would be participating in the reunion of Dark Angel, who still play live occasionally to this day. The band is also planning to release a new album in the future.

It runs from the intersection with Illinois Route 73 north of Lanark east to Illinois Route 43 (Harlem Avenue) in Chicago. This is a distance of .  Route description  Looking east at Illinois Route 72 just west of Illinois Route 43 (Harlem Avenue). Due to a lack of right-of-way, the western lanes are routed onto a two-lane bridge over the eastbound exit ramp from Interstate 90 (Kennedy Expressway) to Harlem Avenue. Illinois 72 is called Higgins Road for most of its length in the Chicago area, and has been redirected in parts of the area to accommodate for new features. Near Rosemont, the road has been shifted to make way for O'Hare International Airport -- further east, parts of the road have been moved to make room for the Northwest Tollway (Interstate 90). The road serves as a major six-lane thoroughfare for several western suburbs, including Schaumburg, Elk Grove Village, and Hoffman Estates. Illinois 72 runs concurrently for one block with Illinois Route 83 in Elk Grove Township, and Illinois Route 47 and U.S. Highway 20 by Starks, an unincorporated village approximately from Chicago. The latter is a Wrong-way concurrency, where one can be driving both west on Illinois 72 and east on U.S. 20 at the same time. West from Chicago, Illinois 72 largely parallels Interstate 90 until Starks, crossing over and under the highway six times without an intersection. On a larger scale, it is the main east-west artery to Chicago between Interstate 90 and Illinois Route 64. It serves the towns and cities of, from west to east, Lanark, Shannon, Forreston, Leaf River, Byron, Stillman Valley, Kirkland, Kingston, Genoa, Hampshire, Gilberts, Sleepy Hollow, West Dundee, East Dundee, South Barrington, Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Elk Grove Village, Des Plaines, Rosemont, and Chicago. Higgins Road/Higgins Avenue continues east-southeast from Harlem Avenue in Chicago to Milwaukee Avenue near Lawrence Avenue. Route 72 is one of seven state roads to enter the city of Chicago. It was once part of the Galena-Chicago Stagecoach Trail.  History  SBI Route 72 originally ran from Lanark to Starks. It was extended east in 1937 and 1938 to East Dundee, and then to Chicago. In 1968, the designation of IL 72 was truncated back to IL 43 (Harlem Avenue), lopping off . In 1982, it was shortened again, this time to Illinois Route 73.

Background The Kansas Territory was created in 1854. The largest issue by far in territorial Kansas was whether slavery was to be permitted or prohibited; aside from the moral question, which at the time was seen as a religious question, the admission of Kansas to the highly polarized Union would help either the pro- or anti-slavery faction in Congress. As a procedure for resolving the issue, Congress accepted the proposal of Senator Stephen Douglass, that the question be settled by popular sovereignty: the residents of the territory would decide the question by vote. This seemingly wise solution did not work, because there was no accepted definition of who was a resident of the territory and could therefore vote. Hoping to make Kansas a slave state, thousands of \\"Border Ruffians\\" from the neighboring slave state of Missouri poured into Kansas, some with the intent to live in Kansas, but more planning to return to Missouri as soon as they had voted. The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and similar groups sponsored free-state farmers who would move to Kansas. The most famous of these was John Brown, who told the free-state Kansans that violence was unfortunately necessary if Kansas were to be a free state. He put this into practice himself at the Pottawatomie massacre of 1856. As it was put later by his son John Brown, Jr., \\"only force and fire-arms kept slavery out of Kansas\\". The upshot was that there were sizeable pro- and anti-slavery factions in Kansas, although the former were more numerous, if one accepted at face value their claim to be genuine Kansas residents. The upshot was duelling constitutions: for several years Kansas had two governments, in two different cities (Lecompton and Lawrence), with two constitutions, one pro- and one anti-slavery, each claiming to be the only legitimate government of the entire territory.. Duelling constitutions During the Bleeding Kansas period The Wyandotte Constitution admitted Kansas as a free state, although it was not the only choice. There were four constitutions made for Kansans to vote on, the Topeka Constitution, the Leavenworth Constitution, the Lecompton Constitution and the Wyandotte Constitution. After voting took place in a climate of intimidation and open violence, the Lecompton Constitution was voted to be the constitution of Kansas, and would have made Kansas a slave state. All that was left to do was send it to Washington D.C. After a rigorous national debate over the topic, it was overruled. The people of Kansas were set to vote on the four constitutions again. After another voting session, the Wyandotte Constitution was to be voted as the constitution of Kansas. Washington approved it and it was decided that the Wyandotte Constitution was the constitution for Kansas. Contents of the Wyandotte Constitution The convention drafting the constitution was held between July 5, 1859 and on July 29, 1859,https://www.kshs.org/publicat/khc/1883_1885_thacher.pdf at Lipman Meyer's Hall just north of Kaw Point in the former community of Wyandotte (which is now part of Kansas City, Kansas in Wyandotte County, Kansas).http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/wyandott/history/1911/volume1/146.html Adoption The Wyandotte Constitution was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530 on October 4, 1859.\\"Kansas Constitutions.\\" KSHS.org. Kansas Historical Society. In April, 1860, the United States House of Representatives voted 134 to 73 to admit Kansas under the Wyandotte Constitution; however, there was resistance in the United States Senate. As 11 slave states seceded from the Union, their senators left their seats and on January 21, 1861, the Senate passed the Kansas bill. The admission of Kansas as a free state became effective January 29, 1861. Terms The constitution settled the terms of Kansas' admission to the United States, particularly establishing that it would be a free state rather than a slave state.Buescher, John. \\"With or Without Slavery.\\" TeachingHistory.org. Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. Retrieved 2 September 2011. The constitution represented a pragmatic compromise over hotly contested issues: it rejected slavery and affirmed separate property rights for married women and their right to participate in school elections, but also denied universal suffrage for women, blacks, and Indians. Solon O. Thacher of Lawrence gave a rousing speech opposing the exclusion of African-Americans from Kansas. The motion to exclude was subsequently defeated, despite the fact that previously, \\"all the Democrats and a few of the Republicans favored the exclusion.\\"Few Republicans and All Democrats favored Exclusion Another issue delegates considered was that of women's rights. Clarina Nichols, social activist and associated editor of Quindaro Chindowan, an abolitionist newspaper, was asked to address the convention. As a result of her efforts, women gained the rights to own property and to participate in school district elections. In addition, the constitution assured that the state would provide for women's equal rights \\"in the possession of their children.\\" Clarina NicholsKSHS Constitution The constitution dramatically reduced the size of the state so its western border did not extend as far as the Rocky Mountains which was part of Kansas Territory and at the time was the height of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush.https://civilwaronthewesternborder.org/encyclopedia/wyandotte- constitution The three earlier constitutions had set the western border as the Rockies.http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/wyandott/history/1911/volume1/146.html The land that was given up became part of Colorado Territory. The previous proposed state constitutions were the Topeka Constitution of 1855, the Lecompton Constitution of 1857 and the Leavenworth Constitution of 1858. Amended many times (including a universal suffrage amendment in 1912), the Wyandotte Constitution is still the constitution of Kansas. Slavery is prohibited: \\"SEC. 6. There shall be no slavery in this State, and no involuntary servitude, except for the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\\" Preamble Kansas's constitution is the only state constitution to attempt to recognize \\"civil privileges\\" through \\"Almighty God\\" distinct from rights of citizens of the United States. The preamble also conflates \\"America\\" with \\"United States\\" in its reference to seeking \\"to insure the full enjoyment of our rights as American citizens\\" rather than citizens of the United States.

The city of Frederick convinced the owners of the then-Hagerstown Suns to move the team to Frederick and promised a 4,000-seat stadium to be built for the 1990 season. For the 1989 season, the Keys played at McCurdy Field, a Babe Ruth League stadium, while waiting for the construction of the new stadium to be completed. The Keys opened by losing both ends of a doubleheader (including a seven-inning perfect game by Dennis Burlingame) against the Durham Bulls. Their first win came on April 11, 1989, with a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Kinston Indians in the Keys' first-ever home game.

It is one of the few state roads in Illinois to be shorter than the name of the road that it marks, as Algonquin Road continues westward as McHenry CR A48 to IL 47 (about ), eastward as a local road to Oakton Street and Riverside Drive by I-294 (about ), and northward as a local road to U.S. Route 14 (US 14, about ) in Fox River Grove. The eastward extent of Algonquin Road is mainly residential, however. It is a four lane street through downtown Algonquin and then shifts to a two lane rural road east of IL 25. It returns to a four lane urban artery east of IL 59. In 2017, IL 62 had an average daily traffic (ADT) of 35,000 on the segment between in Algonquin west of IL 25; 27,000 on the segment between IL 25 and Helm Road; and 39,000 on the segment east of IL 68. History SBI Route 62 was Algonquin to Chicago along the current IL 62. It followed Oakton Street and Talcott Road (in Park Ridge) to reach IL 43. By 1979, IL 62 was dropped east of IL 83. In 2014, the western terminus of IL 62 was extended west from Main Street to Western Algonquin Bypass. Future The Western Algonquin Bypass opened to traffic in September 2014. The bypass has a diamond interchange with Algonquin Road. The bypass removes through north-south traffic on IL-31 from Main Street at the intersection of Main Street and Algonquin Road/IL 62 in downtown Algonquin. The Western Algonquin Bypass is not the only limited access bypass on the table anymore as of 2015. A southern Algonquin bypass is also being constructed as the Longmeadow Parkway which terminates at IL 62 in Barrington Hills. Starting in 2017, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) conducted a study of IL 62 from IL 25 to IL 68. The recommended alternative is to convert this section of IL 62 into a four-lane divided highway with a separate multi-use trail. When this upgrade is completed, IL 62 will be four lanes for substantially its entire length.

It is a member of the Single-A South Atlantic League (SAL) and an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. Its home games are played at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium. The ballclub has won two South Atlantic League championships, in 1997 and 2000. Also in 1997, the Shorebirds received Baseball America‚Äôs Bob Freitas Award for Class A baseball. In July 2018, Baltimore Orioles extended their contract with the Delmarva Shorebirds. History Frank Perdue's desire for a professional baseball team based in Maryland's Eastern Shore was the driving force in bringing a franchise to Salisbury. Joining the Maryland Baseball Limited Partnership, owners of the Bowie Baysox and Frederick Keys, set the concept in motion. By Autumn 1995 Maryland Baseball purchased the Albany Polecats from Richard M. Holtzman, relocated the franchise to Salisbury and renamed it the Delmarva Shorebirds. The name \\"Shorebirds\\" refers to the marine waterfowl of the Delmarva Peninsula. The team name was chosen by 7-year-old Katie Duffy of Newark, Delaware. The team's geographic appellation is a portmanteau of the states that govern counties on the peninsula: Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia (abbreviated VA). The Shorebirds' first-ever game at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium was a 4-2 win over the Columbus RedStixx before a crowd of 5,787 on April 17, 1996. After fulfilling its two-year Player Development Contract with the Montreal Expos, it officially became an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles on September 26, 1996. The Shorebirds hosted the 2011 South Atlantic League \\"Strike Out Hunger\\" All-Star Game on June 21, 2011. The Shorebirds partnered with Perdue Farms, the Community Foundation of the Eastern Shore and Delmarva's three food banks: Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Food Bank, the Food Bank of Delaware, and the Eastern Shore Branch of the Food Bank of Southeastern Virginia; to help \\"Strike Out Hunger\\". Perdue and the Community Foundation of the Eastern Shore donated $20 to the food banks for each strike out by a Shorebirds pitcher during the Shorebirds 2011 season. The Kyle Moore-managed Shorebirds in 2019 clinched their first postseason berth since 2005 by winning the SAL Northern Division first-half title with the minors' best midseason record at 48-21. A franchise-best 90-48 finish made them the 14th SAL team since 1980 to reach 90 wins in a regular season and the first since the Augusta GreenJackets in 2006. The season ended when the Shorebirds were swept by the Hickory Crawdads in the best-of-three SAL Northern Division Championship Series.Jellinek, Sam. \\"'Birds Season Ends in Sweep to Hickory,\\" Delmarva Shorebirds, Friday, September 6, 2019.

Born and raised in Kansas, Christy took an interest in rock and heavy metal music in his youth, and started playing the drums at age ten. He played in several bands while at school. Christy's music career began in 1992 when he joined the Springfield, Missouri group Public Assassin, and also worked as an electrician. In 1996, Christy formed Burning Inside and relocated to Orlando, Florida, where he joined and toured with several popular heavy metal bands until 2004, including Acheron, Death, Control Denied, Iced Earth, and Leash Law. In 2004, Christy took a break from music and relocated to New York City to join The Howard Stern Show. He has written, directed, and acted in several home made independent films and has performed as a stand-up comedian. He returned to music in 2009 when he formed his own metal band, Charred Walls of the Damned.  Early life  Thomas Richard Christy was born in Fort Scott, Kansas on April 1, 1974.http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/bandmember.php?member_id=77 Richard Christy - Metal Storm His father is a Vietnam veteran. Christy grew up in the nearby town of Redfield, on a \\"farm in the middle of nowhere\\". According to the 2010 census, the town has a population of 146. He became a fan of Kiss and Meat Loaf from four years old when his aunt introduced him to them and bought him their albums a year later. His elder neighbor, a fan of heavy metal music, introduced him to Metal Health (1983) by Quiet Riot which had a considerable effect on Christy. He recalled, \\"I heard those drums and that music and was just blown away. I was new to that whole sound ... Quiet Riot felt like the next step up in terms of heaviness\\". He proceeded to save up his pocket money to purchase the album on audio cassette. Albums that influenced him during this time included Stay Hungry (1984) by Twisted Sister and Powerslave (1984) by Iron Maiden. In 1992, he started playing the guitar. Christy wished to learn the drums after he heard \\"Hot for Teacher\\" by Van Halen, in 1984. His parents had no issue with his decision, and to this day, they remain supportive of his career. When he turned ten, his parents bought him his first drum pad and sticks, practicing on it before they purchased his first full professional kit at a junkyard for $100. Christy bought instructional videos to improve his technique, including tapes from Terry Bozzio. Later in his development, drummers Dave Lombardo and Pete Sandoval inspired him to play fast. He was also influenced by drummers Frankie Banali, Mikkey Dee, Bobby Jarzombek, Sean Reinert, Gene Hoglan. At fourteen, Christy attended his first concert, seeing Stryper and White Lion. Christy's first group was playing in a school band in the mid-1980s which included a position in the school's marching band, playing the snare drum and tympani, which he particularly enjoyed, and wrote a song dedicated to the experience and his teachers named \\"Forever Marching On\\". He passed his school music exams, and played in his first \\"legitimate\\" rock group, Syzygy, at around fifteen which involved live gigs in local bars. Around this time, Christy formed a short lived \\"joke band\\", Bung Dizeez, along with Paul Brewer, Gary White, and sometimes Les Henderson. Their first gig took place \\"on a hay wagon at a keg party.\\" The three wore jock straps over their clothes and performing parody songs and Judas Priest covers. In 1992, Christy graduated from Uniontown High School in Uniontown, Kansas.  Career  = Music = In 1992, the 18-year-old Christy decided to pursue music in college in Kansas. In the week before he was set to begin, he heard one of his favourite bands, Public Assassin from Springfield, Missouri, were looking for a new drummer. After a successful audition in August 1992, he chose to join them rather than study. He then moved from his Fort Scott home and into \\"an old warehouse\\" in Springfield, and played on \\"Raw as Fuck\\", a same-titled mini-CD, and a demo titled Murdered. They toured the midwest across 1993, playing covers. As he needed further income to support himself, Christy learned to become a residential electrician. In December 1993, Christy and Public Assassin guitarist Steve Childers formed a comical group, Skip Skiffington and The Elite, with Skiffington on vocals and Rick Granberg on keyboards. During this time, Christy played in a \\"joke punk band\\" with several friends named Pisser, playing GG Allin and Cocknoose covers. In 1995, Public Assassin disbanded after Christy and Childers had several differences with singer/bassist Greg Ponder. In late 1995, Christy and Childers formed Burning Inside new recruits Jamie Prim on vocals/bass and, later on, Michael Estes on guitar. To increase their potential, the group relocated in February 1996 to Orlando, Florida, an area favourable for the metal scene. Christy arrived by car, carrying everything he owned. They toured, recorded songs for five metal tribute albums, and produced a six-song demo tape of new material released as The Eve of the Entities (2000). Christy stayed in Florida for eight years. His income from music and electric work was limited, so he could only afford accommodation in a storage unit where he also kept and practised his drums for as much as six hours each day. With only an outside garden hose to shower with, he later wrote a song about his appreciation for more comfortable living named \\"The Beast Outside My Window\\". Christy joined local metal group Acheron, touring and playing on Anti-God, Anti-Christ (1996) and Necromanteion Communion (1998). His boss at his electrical company allowed him to spend time away to record and tour with his bands. In 1997, Christy met fellow Orlando resident, singer and guitarist Chuck Schuldiner, in a chance encounter at a Florida book store in Altamonte Mall. Schuldiner was, and remains, an influential figure in Christy's career. Christy was a big fan of Schuldiner's metal band Death, so when he learned the group needed a drummer his friends suggested his name and he was offered an audition. Christy knew \\"all of their albums ... back and forth\\", and auditioned with only Schuldiner and himself present. The audition was a success, and Christy played on The Sound of Perseverance (1998), an album he called \\"the album I'm most proud of\\". In May 1998, Christy toured Europe for four months with Death, which included a spot at the Dynamo Open Air festival in the Netherlands in front of 35,000 people. A friendship and musical camaraderie with Schuldiner also brought Christy into the line-up of Schuldiner's progressive metal group, the more melodic Control Denied. Christy played drums on their debut album, The Fragile Art of Existence (1999) and When Man and Machine Collide, an incomplete album that is yet to be released. The two became close friends, and Christy would spend several Thanksgiving holidays with Schuldiner's family. In December 2001, Schuldiner died from brain cancer. Christy remains close with the family. Between 1999 and 2004, Christy became a member of Iced Earth and Leash Law, timing his schedule in order to perform in multiple bands at once. In April 2000, he played with Incantation on their tour in support of The Infernal Storm (2000), playing to audiences of several hundred at each show. Afterwards, he toured Europe with Demons and Wizards, playing festivals of up to 20,000 people in attendance. He landed the gig in Iced Earth through contacts he knew at Century Media Records, a prominent heavy metal label. His first live gigs with them followed in August 2000, playing festivals including the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany. In 2004, Christy began a five-and-a-half year hiatus as an active musician, but kept in touch with the metal scene by practicing his drums, attending local concerts, and writing articles for several publications. By 2008, he started to write new material, playing the guitar more than he had done previously, and ended up with an entire album in demo form. He signed a recording deal with Metal Blade Records in 2009 to release an album with his metal supergroup, Charred Walls of the Damned. He asked his first choice of musicians to take part in the project: bassist Steve DiGiorgio, vocalist Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens and guitarist Jason Suecof. It took roughly three months for Christy to settle on the band's name, and had around 200 possible names as \\"every good band name has been taken\\". Their self-titled debut album was released in 2010. Their second, Cold Winds on Timeless Days, followed in 2011. Christy named the latter as the first letter of each word matched the band's initials. Christy has performed live with Dream Theater, \\"A Favor House Atlantic\\" with Coheed and Cambria, Tiwanaku, Rick Renstrom, and Wykked Wytch. Sometime after 2011, Christy put together music that featured his three guinea pigs. Three of the songs were released under the band name Boar Glue as part of a split EP with Hatebeak, another band that features an african grey parrot. = The Howard Stern Show = Christy became an avid listener of The Howard Stern Show in 1996 when he moved to Florida, listening to the program \\"every morning religiously\\" with headphones while he worked as an electrician. After he obtained the number to reach the show's answering machine from the Internet, he began to submit comical voicemail messages in 1999, that were played frequently on the air. From 2001, Christy began to send in song parodies and bits about staffers Robin Quivers and K.C. Armstrong. He made his debut appearance on April 24, 2003 when the show was broadcast from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Christy lost a round of blackjack in hope of winning a date with a porn star. Following the departure of \\"Stuttering John\\" Melendez in February 2004, Stern announced the Get John's Job contest a month later, pitting ten listeners who had contributed to the show against each other in competition for the vacated position. Each contestant was given a week to display their talents they could bring to the show, after which the listeners voted online for their favorite. Christy produced a required demo CD of his bits, and was selected to compete for the prize of an initial three- month contract and $25,000. Leaving Iced Earth was a difficult decision for Christy, but felt he could not waste the opportunity to pursue his \\"dream job\\" and work for Stern. He had also grown tired of living in Florida, and wished to move. On July 1, 2004 Christy won the contest with 30% of the vote; Sal Governale was second with 24%. By September 2004, both had joined the show as full-time staff members. Christy then relocated from Florida to New York City, where the show is based. Christy has become known on the show for his prank calls, song parodies, and outrageous stunts, usually performed with Governale. He faced challengers in porn trivia in Stump the Perv, vomited on guests, received a bikini wax, and painted his genitals. From 2005, Christy performed nationwide as a stand-up comedian as part of the Killers of Comedy Tour with other show cast members. In 2006, the show relocated to Sirius XM Radio. Christy hosted a semi-regular metal show on the Liquid Metal channel named Richard Christy's Heavy Metal Hoedown. Christy also hosted Inside the Porn Actors Studio on Howard 101, an interview series that parodied the television series Inside the Actors Studio with porn actresses, with Christy filling the role of host James Lipton. Equipment Christy endorses DDrum drums, Aquarian drumheads, Sabian cymbals, and Vater drumsticks. = Film and television = Christy once dreamed of a career in film after he saw Brad Pitt, from nearby Springfield, Missouri, in Interview with the Vampire. He hung up posters of Pitt in his New York City apartment, and once worked at a computer store owned by Pitt's parents.SIRIUS XM Radio, Howard 100 - The Wrap- Up Show from November 5, 2007 He has been a fan of horror films since his youth, and rates Halloween (1978) as his ‚Äúfaaavorite‚Äù. In the mid-1990s, while living in Missouri, he started to make his own independent, low budget films. His first, Evil Ned 2, a horror comedy was made in 1994. This was followed by its sequel, Evil Ned 3: The Return of Evil Ned 2 ‚Äì Electric Boogaloo, in 1995, with a plot involving \\"dirty magazines, huge hog testicles, gay monsters, Amish erotica, and evil talking ducks\\". The film was produced for $250, \\"200 of which was spent on beer\\". The film premiered at a Missouri hotel, and was made available online in 2007. In 2001, Christy released his feature-length film, Leaving Grunion County. Its premiere was held at the Enzian Theater in Maitland, Florida that April. In 2006, Christy and Governale wrote, directed, and starred in the 30-minute comedy film Supertwink for Stern's on-demand digital cable service Howard Stern On Demand. It premiered at the Pioneer Theater in New York City on January 4, 2006. The film was reviewed by critic Richard Roeper, who panned it. In 2007, Christy appeared in Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay playing the role of a Ku Klux Klansman named Kenny. In the same year, he landed his first television role Rescue Me, portraying a \\"really creepy guy at end of bar\\". In 2009, he appeared as Caleb in the horror film Albino Farm. Also in 2009, Christy and Governale appeared in the 2009 horror novel Castaways, written by horror and crime novelist Brian Keene. Christy has recorded voiceovers for the Adult Swim shows Metalocalypse and Rick and Morty. He guest appeared on the Cartoon Network series Uncle Grandpa, playing Ric. Christy later made a cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as a character simply named \\"Down There!\\". Christy has written articles for Decibel magazine about his love for horror films, named \\"Richard Christy's Horrorscope\\".  Personal life  In 2003, Christy revealed he had been celibate for ten years. Christy married Kristin Jenco on July 30, 2011, in New York City. They have one son, Carson Cain Christy, born in 2017, and affectionately known as \\"Bubby\\". Carson is named after Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, Carson Wentz. The Eagles are Kristin's favorite team. If they have another son, they plan to name him Patrick after Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs are Richard's favorite team. Prior to Super Bowl LIII, on the Howard Stern Wrap Up Show, Christy met Patrick Mahomes and tearfully told him that he loved him and explained his intention to name his next son after him.February 1, 2019 Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show (radio) (Live from Atlanta [Super Bowl LIII media event]) He is also a Kansas City Royals fan and attended the 2015 World Series with fellow Howard Stern Show co-worker Gary Dell'Abate (who is an avid New York Mets fan).

Bands of connective tissue called the tendinous intersections traverse the rectus abdominis, which separates this parallel muscle into distinct muscle bellies. The outer, most lateral line, defining the \\"abs\\" is the linea semilunaris. In the abdomens of people with low body fat, these muscle bellies can be viewed externally and are commonly referred to as \\"four\\", \\"six\\", \\"eight\\", or \\"ten packs\\", depending on how many are visible; although, six is the most common. Structure The rectus abdominis is a long flat muscle, which extends along the whole length of the front of the abdomen, and is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the linea alba. Tendinous intersections (intersectiones tendineae) further subdivide each rectus abdominis muscle into a series of smaller false muscle bellies. Tensing of the rectus abdominis causes the muscle to expand between each tendinous intersection, resulting in the characteristic six or eight pack observed in individuals with low body fat.Abdomen, in Moore, K.L., Dalley, A.F., Agur, A.M.R. (eds). 2014. Clinically Oriented Anatomy: Seventh Edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Philadelphia. PA. pg:191. The upper portion, attached principally to the cartilage of the fifth rib, usually has some fibers of insertion into the anterior extremity of the rib itself. =Size= It is typically around 10 mm thick (compared to 20 mm thick superficial fat),Thickness of the rectus abdominis muscle and the abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue. or 20 mm thick in young athletes such as handball players.Anteroposterior diameter comparison of dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) rectus abdominis in elite handball players. Typical volume is around 300 cm¬≥ in non-active individuals, or almost 500 cm¬≥ in athletes. =Blood supply= The rectus abdominis has many sources of arterial blood supply. Classification of the vascular anatomy of muscles: First, the inferior epigastric artery and vein (or veins) run superiorly on the posterior surface of the rectus abdominis, enter the rectus fascia at the arcuate line, and serve the lower part of the muscle. Second, the superior epigastric artery, a terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery, supplies blood to the upper portion. Finally, numerous small segmental contributions come from the lower six intercostal arteries as well. =Nerve supply= The muscles are innervated by thoraco-abdominal nerves, these are continuations of the T7-T11 intercostal nerves and pierce the anterior layer of the rectus sheath. Sensory supply is from the 7-12 thoracic nerves =Variation= The sternalis muscle may be a variant form of the pectoralis major or the rectus abdominis. Some fibers are occasionally connected with the costoxiphoid ligaments, and the side of the xiphoid process. Function The rectus abdominis is an important postural muscle. It is responsible for flexing the lumbar spine, as when doing a so-called \\"crunch\\" sit up. The rib cage is brought up to where the pelvis is when the pelvis is fixed, or the pelvis can be brought towards the rib cage (posterior pelvic tilt) when the rib cage is fixed, such as in a leg-hip raise. The two can also be brought together simultaneously when neither is fixed in space. The rectus abdominis assists with breathing and plays an important role in respiration when forcefully exhaling, as seen after exercise as well as in conditions where exhalation is difficult such as emphysema. It also helps in keeping the internal organs intact and in creating intra- abdominal pressure, such as when exercising or lifting heavy weights, during forceful defecation or parturition (childbirth). Clinical significance An abdominal muscle strain, also called a pulled abdominal muscle, is an injury to one of the muscles of the abdominal wall. A muscle strain occurs when the muscle is stretched too far. When this occurs the muscle fibers are torn. Most commonly, a strain causes microscopic tears within the muscle, but occasionally, in severe injuries, the muscle can rupture from its attachment. A rectus sheath hematoma is an accumulation of blood in the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. It causes abdominal pain with or without a mass. The hematoma may be caused by either rupture of the epigastric artery or by a muscular tear. Causes of this include anticoagulation, coughing, pregnancy, abdominal surgery and trauma. With an ageing population and the widespread use of anticoagulant medications, there is evidence that this historically benign condition is becoming more common and more serious. On abdominal examination, people may have a positive Carnett's sign. Most hematomas resolve without treatment, but they may take several months to resolve. Other animals The rectus abdominis is similar in most vertebrates. The most obvious difference between animal and human abdominal musculature is that in animals, there are a different number of tendinous intersections.

Interior architecture is the design of a building or shelter from inside out, or the design of a new interior for a type of home that can be fixed. It can refer to the initial design and plan used for a building's interior, to that interior's later redesign made to accommodate a changed purpose, or to the significant revision of an original design for the adaptive reuse of the shell of the building concerned. The latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices, whereby resources are conserved by \\"recycling\\" a structure through adaptive redesign. Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design, interior architecture also refers to the process by which the interiors of buildings are designed to address all aspects of the human use of their structural spaces. Put simply, interior architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms. Interior architecture may refer to: * the art and science of designing and erecting buildings and their interiors, along with other related physical features, by a licensed architect. * the practice of an interior architect, where architecture means to offer or render professional services in connection with the design and construction of a building's interior that has as its principal purpose relating interiors' design to human occupancy or use. * a general term to describe building interiors and related physical features. * a style or method of design and construction for a building's interiors and related physical features. Evolution =Adaptive reuse= Real Estate Opportunities were granted to redevelop the Battersea Power Station of England in November 2010 The Battersea Power Station of England has become an iconic structure through adaptive reuse and has been featured in many forms of culture during its more-than-seventy-year-long history. One of the most successful residential reuse projects was Gasometer City, in Vienna Austria. Four immense disused gasometers were successfully revamped in the late ‚Äò90s and have since become famous in the world of adaptive reuse. This unique redevelopment has since become a sought after place to live with a close-knit inner community, and is looked upon as a very successful example of adaptive reuse. The World Food Prize Hall of Laureates, formerly the Des Moines Public Library on the western bank of the Des Moines River in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Although the original spatial hierarchy of a building is always established by its first architect, subsequent iterations of the interior may not be, and for obvious reasons, older structures are often modified by designers of a different generation according to society‚Äôs changing needs as our cities evolve. This process often re-semanticizes the building as a consequence, and is predicated on the notion that buildings can never really be complete and unalterable. An altered building may look the same on the exterior, but its interior may be completely different spatially. The interior architect must therefore be sensitive not only to the place of the building in its physical and socio-political context, but to the temporal requirements of changing owners and users. In this sense, if the building has ‚Äúgood bones‚Äù the original architectural idea is therefore the first iteration of an internal spatial hierarchy for that structure, after which others are bound to follow Cities are now dense with such buildings, perhaps originally built as banks that are now restaurants, perhaps industrial mills that are now loft apartments, or even railway stations that have become art galleries. In each case the collective memory of the shape and character of the city is generally held to be more desirable than the possibility of a new building on the same site, although clearly economic forces apply. It is also possible to speculate that there might well be further new interiors for these structures in future years, but for each alteration the technical and technological expertise of the era will determine the extent to which the building is modified in its building life cycle. Certain structure's interiors remain unaltered over time due to historic preservation, unchanged use, or financial limitations. Nevertheless, most buildings have only three possible long-range internal futures: First, designated significantly important to maintain visually unchanged, only accommodating unseen modern utilities, access, and structural stabilization, and restoration needs. Second, demolished to make way for a new building on the same site, or abandoned, becoming ruins. Finally, redesigned and altered to accommodate new uses. There are many different degrees of alteration ‚Äì a minor one to enable the building to conform to new legal codes is likely to prolong the first (or indeed later) iteration of interior space, but a major alteration, such as the retention of only the facade, is to all intents and purposes a new building. All possibilities within and between the two extremes are the domain of the interior architect. If the practice of architecture is concerned with the art and science of new building, then the practice of Interior architecture is concerned with the alteration of existing buildings for new uses. = Sustainability = A critical part in the evolution of interior architecture and design is sustainability and consciously thinking of the environment and the materials being sourced- energy use, site selection, water usage, and material selection (Leigh Bacon). This sub-category of Interior Architecture focuses on finding creative and holistic ways of building new or retro fitting existing structures that have little to no impact on the environment. The eco-friendly movement became an important issue around the 1970s when the major energy crisis struck, making individuals aware of their contributions and what can be done to help lighten the impacts (BStone). Sustainability in Interior Architecture has really taken off in the last few decades with the help and advancements of technology, discovering new materials and efficient concepts that still lend the aesthetically pleasing aspect of a design. In past years, when it came to eco- design it had a stale and lack of luxury, elegance, and overall design; which inevitably received the reputation of being a \\"hippies\\" style or way of living. This is far from the case today with the overall known importance of being environmentally responsible, having an abundant amount of material options, and wanting to withhold an aesthetic design. Sustainable design is now a preferred and desired way of thinking and building that has and will be an ever-expanding and growing field. Earnings =Statistics= Median annual wages of wage-and-salary architects were $70,320 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $53,480 and $91,870. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $41,320, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $119,220. Those just starting their internships can expect to earn considerably less. Earnings of partners in established architectural firms may fluctuate because of changing business conditions. Some architects may have difficulty establishing their own practices and may go through a period when their expenses are greater than their income, requiring substantial financial resources. Many firms pay tuition and fees toward continuing education requirements for their employees. Education =Purpose= Education in interior architecture should include the study of historic architectural and design styles, building codes and safety, preserving and restoring old buildings, drawing plans of original designs, and building physical and virtual (computer-based) models. The field of interior architecture has a lot in common with interior design and decorating; however, it typically focuses on architecture and construction. Students of both fields learn to design comfortable, safe, and useful indoor spaces, from downtown penthouses to high school classrooms. A student of interior architecture will learn about much more than artistic concerns, such as choosing which style of furnishings works well in an open, loft-like apartment. Study will also include information on technical issues, such as seismic retrofitting (making old buildings safe from earthquakes).College Board http://www.collegeboard.com/csearch/majors_careers/profiles/majors/04.0501.html =Degree programs= Interior architecture stands at the intersection of architecture, design of the built environment, and conservation. Interior architecture programs address the design issues intrinsic to the re-use and transformation of existing structures through both an innovative and progressive approach. The National Center for Education Statistics states that the definition of a degree program in interior architecture is: \\"A program that prepares individuals to apply architectural principles in the design of structural interiors for living, recreational, and business purposes and to function as professional interior architects. Study includes instruction in architecture, occupational and safety standards, structural systems design, heating and cooling systems design, interior design, specific end-use applications, and professional responsibilities and standards.\\"The National Center for Education Statistics: Definition of Interior Architecture http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/ciplist.asp?CIP2=04/ In addition to earning a degree in interior architecture, general licensure is required to work within the United States and some states have further licensing requirements. In many European countries and in Australia the use of the title \\"Interior Architect\\" is legally regulated. This means that a practicing professional cannot use the title of \\"Interior Architect\\" unless they complete the requirements for becoming a registered or licensed architect as well as completing a degree program.ECIA: European Council of Interior Architects http://www.ecia.net =Example programs= Degree programs in Interior Architecture include: * Woodbury University, BFA and MIA Degree Programs * George Washington University, School of Interior Architecture and Design, BFA and MFA programs * Boston Architectural College, School of Interior Architecture, Bachelor of Interior Architecture/ Master of Interior Architecture * German-Jordanian University, School of Architecture and Built Environment, Department of Architecture and Interior Architecture, Bachelor of Science in Architecture/ Interior Architecture * University of Houston, Gerald D.

Pulse generators are used primarily for working with digital circuits, related function generators are used primarily for analog circuits. Bench pulse generators Simple bench pulse generators usually allow control of the pulse repetition rate (frequency), pulse width, delay with respect to an internal or external trigger and the high- and low-voltage levels of the pulses. More-sophisticated pulse generators may allow control over the rise time and fall time of the pulses. Pulse generators are available for generating output pulses having widths (duration) ranging from minutes down to under 1 picosecond. Pulse generators are generally voltage sources, with true current pulse generators being available only from a few suppliers. Pulse generators may use digital techniques, analog techniques, or a combination of both techniques to form the output pulses. For example, the pulse repetition rate and duration may be digitally controlled but the pulse amplitude and rise and fall times may be determined by analog circuitry in the output stage of the pulse generator. With correct adjustment, pulse generators can also produce a 50% duty cycle square wave. Pulse generators are generally single-channel providing one frequency, delay, width and output. =Optical pulse generators= Light pulse generators are the optical equivalent to electrical pulse generators with rep rate, delay, width and amplitude control. The output in this case is light typically from a LED or laser diode. =Multiple-channels= A new family of pulse generators can produce multiple- channels of independent widths and delays and independent outputs and polarities. Often called digital delay/pulse generators, the newest designs even offer differing repetition rates with each channel. These digital delay generators are useful in synchronizing, delaying, gating and triggering multiple devices usually with respect to one event. One is also able to multiplex the timing of several channels onto one channel in order to trigger or even gate the same device multiple times. A new class of pulse generator offers both multiple input trigger connections and multiple output connections. Multiple input triggers allows experimenters to synchronize both trigger events and data acquisition events using the same timing controller. In general, generators for pulses with widths over a few microseconds employ digital counters for timing these pulses, while widths between approximately 1 nanosecond and several microseconds are typically generated by analog techniques such as RC (resistor-capacitor) networks or switched delay lines. Microwave pulsers Pulse generators capable of generating pulses with widths under approximately 100 picoseconds are often termed as \\"microwave pulsers\\" and typically generate these ultra-short pulses using Step recovery diode (SRD) or Nonlinear Transmission Line (NLTL) methods (for example ). Step Recovery Diode pulse generators are inexpensive but typically require several volts of input drive level and have a moderately high level of random jitter (usually undesirable variation in the time at which successive pulses occur). NLTL-based pulse generators generally have lower jitter, but are more complex to manufacture and do not suit integration in low-cost monolithic ICs. A new class of microwave pulse generation architecture, the RACE (Rapid Automatic Cascode Exchange) pulse generation circuit ,, is implemented using low-cost monolithic IC technology and can produce pulses as short as 1 picosecond, and with repetition rates exceeding 30 billion pulses per second. These pulsers are typically used in military communications applications, and low-power microwave transceiver ICs. Such pulsers, if driven by a continuous frequency clock, will act as microwave comb generators, having output frequency components at integer multiples of the pulse repetition rate, and extending to well over 100 gigahertz (for example ). Applications Pulses can then be injected into a device that is under test and used as a stimulus or clock signal or analyzed as they progress through the device, confirming the proper operation of the device or pinpointing a fault in the device. Pulse generators are also used to drive devices such as switches, lasers and optical components, modulators, intensifiers as well as resistive loads. The output of a pulse generator may also be used as the modulation signal for a signal generator. Non-electronic applications include those in material science, medical, physics and chemistry.

One small species, E. chamaecereus, is known as the peanut cactus. The 128 species range from large and treelike types to small globose cacti. The name derives from echinos hedgehog or sea urchin, and opsis appearance, a reference to these plants' dense coverings of spines. Echinopsis is distinguished from Echinocactus by the length of the flower tube, from Cereus by the form and size of their stems, and from both in the position on the stem occupied by the flowers. They are remarkable for the great size, length of tube, and beauty of their flowers, which, borne upon generally small and dumpy stems, appear much larger and more attractive than would be expected.  Taxonomy  Studies in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in several formerly separate genera being absorbed into Echinopsis: Echinopsis chamaecereus at the Talcott Greenhouse. Some have proposed merging Rebutia as well. Like several other taxonomic changes in Cactaceae, this one has not been universally accepted. Amateur and professional growers still use names like Echinopsis (in the older sense), Lobivia, Setiechinopsis and Trichocereus, although many of the others listed above fell out of common usage long before the change. Changing the genus name necessitated using some different specific epithets to avoid creating duplicate names. Thus both Echinopsis bridgesii and Trichocereus bridgesii previously existed. These are very different plants: Echinopsis bridgesii is a short clumping cactus, whereas Trichocereus bridgesii is a tall columnar cactus similar to E. (or T.) pachanoi. Under the new classification, Trichocereus bridgesii becomes Echinopsis lageniformis. The genus name Trichocereus was given to a number of columnar cacti in 1909 by Vincenzo Riccobono, before the genus was subsumed‚Äîalong with Lobivia‚Äîinto Echinopsis in 1974 by Friedrich. A 2012 genetic and morphological study by Albesiano found Trichocereus to be monophyletic if it included three species of Harrisia. A 2012 genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA indicates Echinopsis is made up of several divergent lineages. E. spachiana was not included in the study but is thought to be related to a Helianthocereus clade. = Species = :Note: some of the species listed below may be synonyms, subspecies, or varieties of others. * Echinopsis adolfofriedrichii G.

Distribution Echinopsis species are native to South America (Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay). They grow only in situations where the soil is sandy or gravelly, or on the sides of hills in the crevices of rocks. Cultivation The growing and resting seasons for Echinopsis are the same as for Echinocactus. Research by J. Smith (former Curator at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) showed that species like the Chilean Echinopsis cristata and its Mexican relatives thrive if potted in light loam, with a little leaf mould and a few nodules of limestone. The limestone keeps the soil open; it is important that the soil should be well drained. In winter, water must be given very sparingly, and the atmosphere should be dry; the temperature need not exceed during the night, and in very cold weather it may be allowed to fall to , provided a higher temperature of is maintained during the day. In spring, the plants should receive the full influence of the increasing warmth of the sun; and during hot weather, they will be benefited by frequent spraying overhead, which should be done in the evening. The soil should never be saturated, as the soft fibrous roots will rot if kept wet for any length of time. None of the species need to be grafted to grow freely and remain healthy, as the stems are all robust enough and of sufficient size to take care of themselves. The only danger is in keeping the plants too moist in winter, for although a little water now and again keeps the stems fresh and green, it deprives them of that rest which is essential to the development of their large, beautiful flowers in summer.

Starting with the 2001 novel Pashazade and continuing with Effendi (2002) and Felaheen (2003), the point of divergence occurs in 1915 by US President Woodrow Wilson brokering an earlier peace so that World War I never expanded outside the Balkans. The books are set in a liberal Islamic Ottoman North Africa in the 21st century, mainly centring on Alexandria, referred to as El Iskandriyah. The central character, Raf, is an enigma. Genetically enhanced, frequently wired on various drugs, occasionally accompanied by the hallucinatory fox Tiriganiaq, and strongly conscientious in everything he does, Raf's past is as much a mystery as his future.  Pashazade  Pashazade (shortlisted for the 2002 Arthur C. Clarke Award, BSFA award for Best Novel and John W. Campbell Memorial Award) The first book centres on the arrival in Alexandria of Bey Ashraf al-Mansur, claimed to be the son of the Emir of Tunis. Shortly after his arrival, though, Raf's tendency to do exactly what he thinks is right leads to unexpected consequences. Between caring for his niece, Hani, and attempting to understand Zara, the girl he was to marry, Raf ends up suspected of his Aunt Nafisa's murder, running from the police as he tries desperately to work out who really killed her. The main story is intercut with out-of-order flashbacks to Raf's past as a schoolboy in Swiss and Scottish boarding schools and as 'ZeeZee', a low-ranking agent of Hu San, an influential Triad boss in Seattle.  Effendi  Effendi Effendi was shortlisted for the BSFA award for Best Novel. The second book opens with the discovery of a body near the mansion of billionaire Hamzah Effendi, Zara's father. As the new Chief of Detectives, Raf is obliged to investigate, he uncovers a past as a child soldier under the infamous Colonel Abad that Hamzah would rather forget. Meanwhile, as agents from Berlin, Washington, DC, and Paris battle diplomatically for influence over North Africa's most influential port, its nominal ruler, the young Khedive, is sent on holiday by the Governor General Koenig Pasha, whose cryptic notes Raf is left struggling to understand. The whole city hangs in the balance, and this time, Raf will need help to save it. This novel includes a second narrative dealing with the young Hamzah's actions as a prepubescent soldier surviving famine and desert to carry out his lethal mission for the mysterious Abad.  Felaheen  Felaheen Felaheen was the winner of the BSFA award for Best Novel and shortlisted for the British Fantasy Award. The third book starts with the near-death of the Emir of Tunis, forcing Raf to investigate the biggest mystery of all, his own origins. As the 11-year-old Hani races to get to the Emir's banquet, Raf is forced underground to discover the truth about his father. Kashif Pasha, the Emir's other son, is intent on removing any threat Raf might pose to his own claim to the throne, but he could get more than he bargained for if Raf's djinn-like abilities are as real as Hani thinks. Frequent flashbacks tell the story of Sally Welham, Raf's mother, from New York to Tunis via Thailand as she sets out to get what she wants.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, LePan was educated at the University of Toronto, at Harvard (where he also taught briefly in the late 1930s), and at Merton College, Oxford. During the Second World War, he was on staff at the Canadian High Commission in London and then served in the Canadian Army as an artilleryman during the Italian campaign. He joined the Canadian diplomatic service in 1946, and during his years as a diplomat served in London (as special assistant to Lester Pearson in the late 1940s) and in Washington, as well as in Ottawa. He was formally in the employ of the Department of External Affairs until 1959, though for several years during that time he was seconded by the Department of Finance to serve as Secretary for the Royal Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects (the \\"Gordon Commission\\"); his work drafting the multi-volume Report of the commission was widely praised. LePan left the diplomatic service in 1959 to return to academic life; he taught at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, and at the University of Toronto, where he was Principal of University College (1964‚Äì1970) and then University Professor and Senior Fellow at Massey College. LePan's wartime experience with the Canadian Army in Italy inspired much of his poetry and one novel, The Deserter (1964). LePan is one of only a few people (Michael Ondaatje and George Bowering are two others) to have won the Governor General's Award both for poetry (1953 for The Net and the Sword) and fiction (1964 for The Deserter, in a highly controversial win over Margaret Laurence's The Stone Angel). In 1982 LePan published his first volume of poetry in almost 30 years (Something Still to Find), and in 1990 he created something of a sensation with Far Voyages, a volume largely composed of gay love poetry. (LePan had married, in 1948 to the former Sarah Katharine Chambers; the two remained together until 1971 and had two children, but the marriage was a difficult one, not least of all over issues relating to sexual orientation.) LePan's 1989 book of memoirs Bright Glass of Memory recounts his involvement with several leading lights of the twentieth century, including John Maynard Keynes and T.S. Eliot. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1998; among his other awards were a Guggenheim Fellowship (1948), the Royal Society of Canada's Lorne Pierce Medal (1976), and several honorary degrees. He remains well known for his war poetry (long poems from the post- war period such as \\"Tuscan Villa\\" and \\"Elegy for the Romagna,\\" as well as shorter, punchier 1980s poems such as \\"Below Monte Cassino\\" in which he recalled the events of a generation earlier); for his poems relating to the landscape of Georgian Bay in Ontario; for his love poems; and for lyric poems in which the poet's passion for the natural world is infused with the suggestion of homoerotic passion (\\"Coureurs de Bois,\\" \\"A Country Without a Mythology\\"). His work has been included in many anthologies, including The Norton Anthology of Poetry, Canadian Literature in English: Texts and Contexts, The Harbrace Anthology of Poetry, The Broadview Anthology of Poetry, and Modern Canadian Poets.

H. (1999). \\"Round Numbers.\\" Ch. 3 in Ramanujan: Twelve Lectures on Subjects Suggested by His Life and Work, 3rd ed. New York: Chelsea, pp. 48‚Äì57. as compared to its neighbouring numbers, such as 24 = 2*2*2*3 (4 factors, as opposed to 3 factors for 27; 2 factors for 21, 22, 25, and 26; and 1 factor for 23). A round number is informally considered to be an integer that ends with one or more \\"0\\"s (zero-digit) in a given base.Sadock, J. M. (1977). Truth and approximation. Berkeley Linguistics Society Papers 3: 430‚Äì439. So, 590 is rounder than 592, but 590 is less round than 600. In both technical and informal language, a round number is often interpreted to stand for a value or values near to the nominal value expressed. For instance, a round number such as 600 might be used to refer to a value whose magnitude is actually 592, because the actual value is more cumbersome to express exactly. Likewise, a round number may refer to a range of values near the nominal value that expresses imprecision about a quantity.Ferson, S., J. O'Rawe, A. Antonenko, J. Siegrist, J. Mickley, C. Luhmann, K. Sentz, A. Finkel (2015). Natural language of uncertainty: numeric hedge words. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 57: 19‚Äì39. Thus, a value reported as 600 might actually represent any value near 600, possibly as low as 550 or as high as 650, all of which would round to 600. In decimal notation, a number ending in the digit \\"5\\" is also considered more round than one ending in another non-zero digit (but less round than any which ends with \\"0\\").de Lusignan, S., J. Belsey, N. Hague and B. Dzregah (2004). End-digit preference in blood pressure recordings of patients with ischaemic heart disease in primary care. Journal of Human Hypertension 18: 261‚Äì265. For example, the number 25 tends to be seen as more round than 24. Thus someone might say, upon turning 45, that their age is more round than when they turn 44 or 46. These notions of roundness are also often applied to non-integer numbers; so, in any given base, 2.3 is rounder than 2.297, because 2.3 can be written as 2.300. Thus, a number with fewer digits which are not trailing \\"0\\"s is considered to be rounder than others of the same or greater precision. Numbers can also be considered \\"round\\" in numbering systems other than decimal (base 10). For example, the number 1024 would not be considered round in decimal, but the same number ends with a zero in several other numbering systems including binary (base 2: 10000000000), octal (base 8: 2000), and hexadecimal (base 16: 400). The previous discussion about the digit \\"5\\" generalizes to the digit representing b/2 for base-b notation, if b is even. Psychology and sociology Psychologically round numbers form waypoints in pricing and negotiation. So, starting salaries are usually round numbers. Prices are often pitched just below round numbers in order to avoid breaking such a psychological barrier. Culture Round-number anniversaries are often especially celebrated. For example, a fiftieth birthday, the centenary of an event, or the millionth visitor or customer to a location or business.

Set during World War II, the novel describes the struggle for survival of American, Australian, British, Dutch, and New Zealander prisoners of war in a Japanese camp in Singapore. Clavell was a prisoner in the Changi Prison camp, where the novel is set. One of the three major characters, Peter Marlowe, is based upon Clavell. King Rat was the first book published of Clavell's sweeping series, the Asian Saga, and the fourth chronologically. Two characters from King Rat also appear in Noble House (1981). Plot summary The novel opens in early 1945. Peter Marlowe, a young British RAF Flight Lieutenant, has been a P.O.W. since 1942. Marlowe comes to the attention of the \\"King\\" (an American corporal who has become the most successful trader and black marketeer in Changi), when King sees him conversing in Malay. Marlowe's languages, intelligence, honesty, and winning personality cause King to befriend him and attempt to involve him in black market deals, which bring Marlowe to the attention of Robin Grey, a British officer and Provost Marshal of the camp, who has developed a Javert-like obsession with King and hopes to arrest him for violating camp regulations. Grey is attempting to maintain military discipline among the prisoners and sees King as the antithesis of his beliefs. As the son of a working-class family, Grey follows the rules for their own sake using his position as Provost Marshal to gain a status otherwise unavailable to him in British society. Despite being an enlisted man and undistinguished in civilian life, King has become a major power in the closed society of the P.O.W. camp through his charisma and intelligence. Trading with Korean guards, local Malay villagers, and other prisoners for food, clothing, information, and what few luxuries are available, King keeps himself and his fellow American prisoners alive. Senior officers come to him for help in selling their valuables to buy food, and other officers are secretly on his payroll. Marlowe is initially put off by King's perspective and behaviour, which clash with the British upper class ideals he has been taught. He turns down a lucrative business partnership with King because \\"Marlowes aren't tradesmen. It just isn't done, old boy\\". Marlowe soon understands that King is not the thief and con artist that Grey would have him believe. Rather, King asks for the best of each man and rewards him accordingly, irrespective of class or position. Through the experiences of Marlowe, King, and other characters, the novel offers a vivid, often disturbing portrayal of men brought to the edge of survival by a brutal environment. The P.O.W.s are given nothing by the Japanese other than filthy huts to live in and the bare minimum of food. Officers from various parts of Britain's Asian empire, accustomed to having native servants provide them with freshly laundered uniforms daily, are reduced to wearing rags and homemade shoes. For most, the chief concern is obtaining enough food to stay alive from day to day and avoiding disease or injury, since almost no medical care is available. Some are degraded and come close to losing their humanity, while others display levels of courage and compassion beyond expectations. Some literally steal food out the mouths of their comrades, while others give away what they have or take terrible risks to help their friends. King decides he and his friends should breed rats to sell for food. His comrades, though nearly starving themselves, are repulsed at the idea of eating rat meat, so King comes up with the plan of only selling the meat to officers without telling them the true source. A group of officers who stole money from their underlings are later seen greedily enjoying a meal of \\"Rusa tikus\\" not knowing they are actually eating rat meat. When the camp is ultimately liberated, most of the soldiers have trouble adjusting to freedom. King loses his power and is shunned by the others. Grey ironically thanks King on the grounds that his hatred of King was the only thing keeping him alive. At the end the rats are abandoned in their cages when the camp is abandoned. The final scene shows the rats consuming each other one by one, with the final survivor becoming \\"king of the rats\\".

Two characters from King Rat also appear in Noble House (published 1981), a novel set in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, when Marlowe is a writer visiting Hong Kong to conduct research about the great British trading companies there. Grey, embittered by his failure to obtain a commission in the postwar British Army despite his suffering during the war, has become a radical socialist Member of UK Parliament and is also in Hong Kong on an official visit. Unknown to Marlowe, Grey has become a secret Communist and a Soviet agent who tries to thwart efforts to improve relations between China and the West.

It is distinctive from other Japanese green teas because it is roasted in a porcelain pot over charcoal, whereas most Japanese teas are steamed.

Description H≈çjicha is often made from bancha (, \\"common tea\\"), tea from the last harvest of the season; however, other varieties of H≈çjicha also exist, including a variety made from sencha, and kukicha, tea made from the twigs of the tea plant rather than the leaves. H≈çjicha infusions have a light- to reddish-brown appearance and are less astringent due to losing catechins during the high-temperature roasting process. The roasted flavors are extracted and dominate this tea: the roasting replaces the vegetative tones of other varieties of Japanese green tea with a toasty, slightly caramel-like flavor. The roasting process used to make H≈çjicha also lowers the amount of caffeine in the tea.

History  Founded by Clifford W. Holmes and the Riverside Astronomical Society, the RTMC Astronomy Expo began in 1969 as the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference at Riverside City College in Riverside, California. It consisted of a series of lectures about astronomy and telescope making with a competition for quality and innovative telescopes. In 1973 it was moved to a dark-sky site near Idyllwild and in 1975 it was moved to its current home near Big Bear City. It is held on the three-day Memorial Day weekend. In 2010, it was held in May on the weekend that corresponded with new moon to allow amateur astronomers the best viewing conditions. Due to low attendance the date was moved back to the Memorial Day weekend in 2011 RTMC Dates The organization annually presents the Clifford W. Holmes Award for \\"Major Contribution to Popularizing Astronomy, the Warren Estes Memorial Award for \\"Best Use of Simple Materials and Technique\\" in making telescopes, and the Clyde Tombaugh Award \\"Creative Innovation in Telescope Design\\". To better reflect the evolution of amateur astronomy, the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference was renamed the RTMC Astronomy Expo in 2003. Each year the scope of activities continues to grow and evolve and has lectures, workshops, extensive beginners activities, a swap meet, astronomy clubs and other organizations, and vendors demonstrating and selling astronomical products. The Expo continues to promote family activities with swimming, canoeing, horseback riding, archery, wall climbing. Extensive hiking and mountain biking trails are also available. On 12 October 2019, the Board of the RTMC announced that 2019 was the last year that the Astronomy Expo will be heldhttp://rtmcastronomyexpo.org/.  Nightfall  The RTMC also produces an early autumn star party called Nightfall in Borrego Springs, CA. Nightfall is held on the weekend in October that corresponds with the new moon.  Pacific Astronomy and Telescope Show (PATS)  In 2007, the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference, Inc. announced a fall event to be held in Pasadena named the Pacific Astronomy and Telescope Show (PATS). This annual event was held annually 2008 thru 2012 at the Pasadena Convention Center and focused displays by commercial vendors, astronomy clubs and other organizations as well as talks and workshops. The first PATS was held September 13‚Äì14, 2008. The 2013 event was cancelled. PATS was designed to complement the ongoing RTMC Astronomy Expo.

A lawyer by profession, Brandt was the Personal Administrative Officer to Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (Pers√∂nlicher Referent vom Reichsf√ºhrer SS) Heinrich Himmler and a defendant at the Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg for his part in securing the 86 victims of the Jewish skeleton collection, an attempt to create an anthropological display of plaster body casts and skeletal remains of Jews.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, second revised edition, Frankfurt am Main 2005, p. 71 He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and executed in 1948. Life and work Rudolf Brandt, the son of a railway worker, was born on 2 June 1909, and raised in modest circumstances in the town of Frankfurt an der Oder. Brandt was a member of the student's stenography (shorthand) club at the Realgymnasium, and in 1927, at the age of 18, won a competition with a transcription speed of 360 syllables per minute. He attended the University of Berlin and the University of Jena (1928‚Äì1932), simultaneously working from 1928 to 1930 as a court reporter at the Provisional National Economic Council. Brandt would continue to practice stenography in the evenings with his colleague and former Frankfurt schoolmate Gerhard Herrgesell.Peitz, Detlef. Gerhard Herrgesell: SS-judge and parliamentary stenographer. Simultaneously a contribution to the beginnings of the administration of the German Bundestag. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr Parlamentsfragen, vol. 45, no. 1, pp. 141‚Äì157 Brandt was awarded a doctorate of law from the University of Jena in July 1933. He joined the Nazi Party in January 1932 (membership number 1,331,536) and the SS in October 1933 (membership number 129,771). Brandt and his skills in transcription were noticed by Heinrich Himmler, who had him transferred to his staff. On 11 December 1933, he joined the Staff of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Himmler in the capacity of clerk. In November 1935, he was commissioned an Untersturmf√ºhrer (second lieutenant) and ultimately rose to the rank of Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel).Statement of Rudolf Brandt from 10 December 1946 on Nuremberg trials Project In 1936, Brandt was named Chief of the Personal Staff of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (Leiter des Pers√∂nlichen Stabes RFSS), and in 1937, Pers√∂nlicher Referent des RFSS, a position he held until the end of the war in May 1945. In this position Brandt handled Himmler's entire correspondence with the exception of matters pertaining to the Waffen-SS or the Police. Walter Schellenberg, the Ausland-SD department chief who reported directly to Himmler, said of Brandt: In 1938 or 1939, Brandt became Himmler's liaison officer to the Reich Ministry of the Interior and particularly to the Office Secretary of the Interior. In 1943, when Himmler became Minister of the Interior, Brandt was Ministerial Councilor and Head of the Minister's Office in the Reich Ministry of the Interior. Brandt was also a member of the Ahnenerbe society, of which Himmler was President. On account of his position, Brandt was also the liaison officer to the Reich Secretary of the Ahnenerbe Society, Wolfram Sievers. Brandt was briefly absent from Himmler's office, from 30 March 1941 to 11 May 1941. During this time he fought with the Artillery Regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler in the campaign against Greece. Jewish skeleton collection Originally the \\"specimens\\" to be used in the collection were to be Jewish commisars in the Red Army captured on the Eastern front by the Wehrmacht. The individuals ultimately chosen for the collection were obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at Auschwitz concentration camp in Occupied Poland. They were chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. The initial selections were carried out by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Dr. Bruno Beger and Dr. Hans Fleischhacker, who arrived in Auschwitz in the first half of 1943 and finished the preliminary work by 15 June 1943. Due to a typhus epidemic at Auschwitz, the candidates chosen for the skeleton collection were quarantined in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens. In February 1942, Sievers submitted to Himmler, through Rudolf Brandt, a report from which the following is an extract read at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial by General Telford Taylor, Chief Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg:''' End of the war In August 1944, Brandt informed Standartenf√ºhrer Guntram Pflaum, whom Himmler had appointed head of pest control, of Himmler's desire to create a \\"Fly and Gnat Room\\", where \\"all SS leaders and police who are either uninterested in the nuisance created by flies or even dismiss it with a superior smile will find they will be taken into care there for some considerable time, during which they will have the opportunity to study the question of flies and gnats from a theoretical angle as well as to enjoy the attentions of the hundreds and thousands of flies and gnats in the room itself.\\" Brandt was a member of the entourage which accompanied Himmler into hiding, leaving Flensberg on 10 May 1945, with the goal of reaching Bavaria. He became separated from Himmler and surrendered along with half of the six-man group to British troops on 21 May. On the same day, Himmler and his two aides Werner Grothmann and Heinz Macher were stopped and detained at a checkpoint set up by former Soviet POWs. On 23 May Himmler was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near L√ºneburg. Brandt watched from inside the wire of the detention camp when Himmler was brought in. Himmler identified himself to the duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester. Himmler was then taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army in L√ºneburg, where during a medical exam he committed suicide by biting down on a hidden cyanide ampule. Trial and execution Rudolf Brandt was indicted after the war by the US Military Tribunal, on charges of: # Conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity; # War crimes, to wit performing medical experiments without the subjects' consent on prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, as well as participation in the mass-murder of concentration camp inmates; # Crimes against humanity: committing crimes described under count 2 also on German nationals; and # Membership in a criminal organization, the SS. Brandt, in common with most of the defendants at the Doctor's Trial, was acquitted on the first count as the Tribunal felt that it fell outside their jurisdiction. He was found guilty on the other three counts, as he had been responsible for the administration and coordination of the experiments at the camps. He was hanged on 2 June 1948, his 39th birthday.

Early life Mariette H√©l√®ne Delangle was the daughter of Alexandrine Bouillie and L√©on Delangle, the postman in Aunay-sous-Auneau, Eure-et-Loir, a village 47 miles from Paris. She went to Paris at age 16, initially working as a nude model for artist Rene Carrere, who encouraged her to take up ballet, leading to her becoming a very successful dancer under the stage name H√©l√®ne Nice which eventually became Hell√© Nice. She built a solid reputation as a solo act but in 1926 decided to partner with Robert Lisset and performed at cabarets around Europe. Her income from dancing as well as modelling became such that she could afford to purchase a home and her own yacht. However, her dancing career was cut short in 1929 after she had an accident whilst evading an avalanche while skiing, saving her life but injuring her knee badly. In addition to the fast cars of her racing career, Nice lived a fast life. Her growing fame meant there was no shortage of suitors. Some of her affairs were brief while others were of longer duration that, beyond the wealthy and powerful Philippe de Rothschild, included members of the European nobility and other personalities such as Henri de Courcelles, Jean Bugatti and Count Bruno d'Harcourt. Racing career Nice was introduced to motor racing by racing driver de Courcelles. At the time, the Paris area was one of the principal centres of the French car industry and there were numerous competitions for auto enthusiasts. Nice loved the thrill of driving fast cars and so snatched the chance to perform in the racing event at the annual fair organized by fellow performers from the Paris entertainment world. She was an avid downhill skier but an accident on the slopes damaged her knee and ended her dancing career. Hell√© Nice decided to try her hand at professional auto racing. In June 1929, driving an Om√©ga-Six, she won a short (50km) 5-car race (entitled the \\"Grand Prix f√©minin\\") and finished 15th in the main (150km) Women's Championship race (both races run on a handicap basis) at the all-female Journ√©e F√©minine at Autodrome de Montlh√©ry. In December of the same year and at the same venue she recorded a speed of 196.871km/h over 5km (with a best lap at 197.7km/h (123.56mph)) in a 2-litre supercharged Bugatti, unofficially a world record speed for women. Capitalising on her fame, the following year she toured the United States, racing at a variety of tracks in an American- made Miller racing car. Philippe de Rothschild introduced himself to her shortly after her return from America. For a time, the two shared a bed and the love of automobile racing. Rothschild had been racing his Bugatti and he introduced her to Ettore Bugatti. The owner of the very successful car company thought Nice would be an ideal person to add to the male drivers of his line of racing vehicles. She achieved her goal and in 1931 and drove a Bugatti Type 35C in a number of minor Grands Prix in France and in the non-championship Monza Grand Prix. Hell√© Nice was easily recognizable in her bright-blue race car. She wowed the crowds whenever she raced while adding to her income with a string of product endorsements, including advertising for Esso and Lucky Strike, which saw her featured on thousands of posters, helping her to become one of the most famous people in France. She also earned significant amounts from racing, receiving entry fees worth the equivalent of $100,000 per race when inflation-adjusted to the 2018 value of the dollar. Although she never competed in a major Grande Epreuve and never won a Grand Prix race, she was a regular participant, and occasionally finished ahead of some of her male rivals. Over the next several years, as the only female appearing on the Grand Prix circuit, Nice continued to race Bugattis and Alfa Romeos against the greatest drivers of the day. She competed not only in minor Grand Prix races but also hillclimbs and rallies all over Europe, winning the 1932 Rallye Paris ‚Äì Saint-Rapha√´l F√©minin, and also appearing in the famous Monte Carlo Rally. On 10 September 1933, she was a competitor at one of the most tragic races in history. During the 1933 Monza Grand Prix - a formula libre event held on the same day as the Italian Grand Prix, but on different circuit layout - at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Giuseppe Campari, Baconin \\"Mario Umberto\\" Borzacchini, and the Polish count Stanislas Czaikowski, three of the leading race drivers of the day, were killed.\\"La Rivista di Monza\\", 1933, settembre, p. 21‚Äì25 Nice finished third (and last of the finishers) in the race's second heat, in which Campari and Borzacchini had been killed and was flagged off in 9th place, two laps behind the winner, in the shortened final in which Czaikowski had died. =Crash= In 1936, she travelled to Brazil to compete in two Grand Prix races. During the S√£o Paulo Grand Prix, she was in third place behind Brazilian champion Manuel de Teff√© when a freak accident resulted in her nearly being killed. Her Alfa Romeo somersaulted through the air and crashed into the grandstand, killing six people and injuring more than thirty others. Nice was thrown from the car and landed on a soldier who absorbed the full impact of her body, saving her life. The force of the impact killed the soldier and because she lay unconscious, she too was thought to be dead. Taken to hospital, she awoke from a coma three days later and two months later was discharged from the hospital. The tragedy turned her into a national hero among the Brazilian population. In 1937, she attempted a racing comeback, hoping to compete in the Mille Miglia and at the Tripoli Grand Prix, which offered a very substantial cash prize. However, she was unable to get the necessary backing and instead participated in the \\"Yacco\\" endurance trials for female drivers at the Montlh√©ry racetrack in France. There, alternating with three other women, Nice drove for ten days and ten nights, the team breaking ten world records over distances and periods from 20,000km to 10 days. World War 2 For the next two years, she competed in rallying while hoping to rejoin the Bugatti team. However, in August 1939, her friend Jean Bugatti was killed while testing a company vehicle and a month later, racing in Europe came to a halt with the onset of World War II. In 1943, during the German occupation of France, she moved to the French Riviera and acquired a home in Nice, where she lived for the remainder of the war. =Accusations of collaboration = In 1949 fellow driver Louis Chiron accused her at a party in Monaco to celebrate the first postwar Monte Carlo Rally of \\"collaborating with the Nazis\\". However, her biographer Miranda Seymour is \\"circumspect on Nice's guilt\\", setting out various ways in which (hypothetically) she might have been considered to have collaborated, but noting that her enquiries at the Bundesarchiv in Berlin yielded no record of Nice having been a \\"Gestapo agent\\", as Chiron had appeared to claim. Despite the absence of definitive evidence, the accusation nevertheless left her \\"unemployable\\"., being enough to deter sponsors and effectively ending her career.  Final years and death  One of the 20th century's most colourful women, who had competed with some success in more than 70 events at the higher echelons of automobile racing, spent her final years in a sordid rat-infested apartment in the back alleys of the city of Nice, living under a fictitious name to hide her shame. Neighbours recalled Nice \\"taking the milk out of the cats' saucers because she had nothing to eat or drink\\". Estranged from her family for years, she died penniless, friendless, and completely forgotten by the rich and glamorous crowd involved in Grand Prix motor racing. Her cremation was paid for by the Parisian charity organisation that had helped her, and the ashes were sent back to her sister in the village of Sainte-Mesme near her birthplace and where her parents were buried. She is not mentioned on the family's cemetery memorial. In 2008 a memorial plaque was erected on her previously unmarked grave by a foundation established in her name.

In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, depending on the context, Ishvara can mean supreme soul, ruler, lord, king, queen or husband. In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, Ishvara means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self. In Vaishnavists and for many Hindus, Ishvara is synonymous with Vishnu, sometimes as Parabrahman or Parameshvara meaning the \\"Supreme lord\\", or as an Ishta-deva (personal god). Similarly for Shaivism and many Hindus, it is synonymous with Shiva or Maheshwara. In traditional Bhakti movements, Ishvara is one or more deities of an individual's preference from Hinduism's polytheistic canon of deities. In modern sectarian movements such as Arya Samaj and Brahmoism, Ishvara takes the form of a monotheistic God.RK Pruthi (2004), Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization, , pages 5‚Äì6, 48‚Äì49 In the Yoga school of Hinduism, it is any \\"personal deity\\" or \\"spiritual inspiration\\". Etymology The root of the word Ishvara comes from ƒ´≈õ- (‡§à‡§∂, Ish) which means \\"capable of\\" and \\"owner, ruler, chief of\\".Arthur Anthony Macdonell (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 47 The second part of the word Ishvara is vara which means depending on context, \\"best, excellent, beautiful\\", \\"choice, wish, blessing, boon, gift\\", and \\"suitor, lover, one who solicits a girl in marriage\\".Arthur Anthony Macdonell (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 270 The composite word, Ishvara literally means \\"owner of best, beautiful\\", \\"ruler of choices, blessings, boons\\", or \\"chief of suitor, lover\\". As a concept, Ishvara in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, variously means God, Supreme Being, Supreme Soul, lord, king or ruler, rich or wealthy man, god of love, deity Vishnu.Monier Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, Search for Izvara, University of Cologne, GermanyApte Sanskrit-English dictionary, Search for Izvara, University of Cologne, GermanyJames Lochtefeld, \\"Ishvara\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing. , page 306 The word ƒ™≈õvara never appears in Rigveda. However, the verb ƒ´≈õ- does appear in Rig veda, where the context suggests that the meaning of it is \\"capable of, able to\\".Madhav Deshpande (1991), Sense and Syntax in Vedic (Editors: Joel Brereton and Stephenie Jamison), Volumes 4‚Äì5, Brill, , pages 23‚Äì27 It is absent in Samaveda, is rare in Atharvaveda, appears in Samhitas of Yajurveda. The contextual meaning, however as the ancient Indian grammarian PƒÅ·πáini explains, is neither god nor supreme being. The word Ishvara appears in numerous ancient Dharmasutras. However, Patrick Olivelle states that there Ishvara does not mean God, but means Vedas. Deshpande states that Ishvara in Dharmasutras could alternatively mean king, with the context literally asserting that \\"the Dharmasutras are as important as Ishvara (the king) on matters of public importance\\".Patrick Olivelle (2006), Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE: Society in India, Oxford University Press, , page 176 In Saivite traditions of Hinduism, the term is used as part of the compound \\"Maheshvara\\" (\\"great lord\\") as a name for Shiva. In Mahayana Buddhism it is used as part of the compound \\"Avalokite≈õvara\\" (\\"lord who hears the cries of the world\\"), the name of a bodhisattva revered for his compassion. When referring to divine as female, particularly in Shaktism, the feminine ' is sometimes used. In Advaita Vedanta school, Ishvara is a monistic Universal Absolute that connects and is the Oneness in everyone and everything.Lance Nelson (1996), Living liberation in Shankara and classical Advaita, in Living Liberation in Hindu Thought (Editors: Andrew O. Fort, Patricia Y. Mumme), State University of New York Press, , pages 38‚Äì39, 59 (footnote 105) Schools of thought Among the six systems of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya and Mimamsa do not consider the concept of Ishvara, i.e., a supreme being, relevant. Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings. Desmarais states that Isvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras.Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 131 It does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (Bhakti), nor does it give Ishvara characteristics typically associated with a deity. In Yoga school of Hinduism, states Whicher, Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, explain the term Ishvara as the \\"Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings\\".Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, , pages 82‚Äì86 Malinar states that in Samkhya-Yoga schools of Hinduism, Isvara is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.A Malinar (2014), Current Approaches: Articles on Key Themes, in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, , page 79 Zimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school.Zimmer (1951), Philosophies of India, Reprinted by Routledge in 2008, , pages 242‚Äì243, 309‚Äì311 Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, Hare Krishna movement considers Krishna as the Lord,Karel Werner (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism, Routledge, , page 54 Brahmoism movement influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India probably conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord. In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the Vishishtadvaita Vedanta of Ramanuja and Dvaita Vedanta of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the prakriti (material world) and purusha (soul, spirit). Radhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in Isvara concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of \\"personal God\\" where the \\"ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed\\".Radhakrishnan and Moore (1967, Reprinted 1989), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 37‚Äì39, 401‚Äì403, 498‚Äì503 Riepe, and others,Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 73‚Äì76 state that schools of Hinduism leave the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Isvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of \\"deity of one's choice\\" or \\"formless Brahman (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)\\".Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 177‚Äì184, 208‚Äì215RC Zaehner (1975), Our savage god: The perverse use of eastern thought, , pages 69‚Äì72R.C.

Isvara is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 76‚Äì77 =In Yoga= The Yogasutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of Yoga school of Hinduism, uses the term Ishvara in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra's release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is Isvara? These commentaries range from defining Isvara from a \\"personal god\\" to \\"special self\\" to \\"anything that has spiritual significance to the individual\\".HariharƒÅnanda ƒÄra·πáya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; HariharƒÅnanda ƒÄra·πáya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126‚Äì129 Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of Isvara in Yoga philosophy functions as a \\"transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation\\".Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, , page 86 Patanjali defines Isvara (Sanskrit: ‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) in verse 24 of Book 1, as \\"a special Self (‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑, puru·π£a-vi≈õe·π£a)\\", > Sanskrit: > ‚Äì Yoga Sutras I.24 This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of Isvara as that special Self which is unaffected (‡§Ö‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü, aparamrsta) by one's obstacles/hardships (‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§∂, klesha), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ, karma), one's life fruits (‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§æ‡§ï, vip√¢ka), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (‡§Ü‡§∂‡§Ø, ashaya).aparAmRSTa , kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya ; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, GermanyLloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 31‚Äì45 Patanjali's concept of Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 77 =In Vaisesika school of Hinduism= Vai≈õe·π£ika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on Ishvara for its atomistic naturalism philosophy. To it, substances and paramƒÅ·πáu (atoms) were eternal, they moved and interacted based on impersonal, eternal adrsta (‡§Ö‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü, invisible) laws of nature.A Goel (1984), Indian philosophy: NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika and modern science, Sterling, , pages 149‚Äì151 The concept of Ishvara, among others, entered into Vaisheshika school many centuries later in 1st millennium AD.R Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies, Harvard University Press, , page 836 This evolution in ideas aimed to explain how and why its so-called \\"atoms\\" have a particular order and proportions. These later-age ancient Vai≈õe·π£ika scholars retained their belief that substances are eternal, added Ishvara as another eternal who is also omniscient and omnipresent (not omnipotent). Ishvara did not create the world, according to this school of Hindu scholars, but He only created invisible laws that operate the world and then He becomes passive and lets those hidden universal laws do its thing. Thus, Vaisheshika's Ishvara mirrors Deus otiosus of Deism. Vaisheshika school's Ishvara, states Klaus Klostermaier, can be understood as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He \\"winds up the clock, and lets it run its course\\".Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York, , page 337 =In Nyaya= Early Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits.

Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34 Over time, the Nyaya school became one of the most important defenders of theism in Hindu philosophy.Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, , pages 18‚Äì19, 35‚Äì39 In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including Ishvara. Verses 19‚Äì21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid. Centuries later, the 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada revisited the premise of Ishvara. He was followed by Udayana, who in his text Nyayakusumanjali, interpreted \\"it\\" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as \\"human action\\" and \\"him\\" as \\"Ishvara\\", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara.Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 209-10 In developing his arguments, he inherently defined Ishvara as efficient cause, omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, giver of gifts, ability and meaning to humanity, divine creator of the world as well as the moral principles, and the unseen power that makes the karma doctrine work.VR Rao (1987), Selected Doctrines from Indian Philosophy, , pages 11‚Äì12 =In Mimamsa= Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ scholars of Hinduism questioned what is Ishvara (God)?FX Clooney (1997), What‚Äôs a god? The quest for the right understanding of devatƒÅ in BrƒÅhma·πÖical ritual theory (Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ), International Journal of Hindu Studies, August 1997, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 337‚Äì385 They used their pramana tools to cross examine answers offered by other schools of Hinduism. For example, when Nyaya scholars stated God is omnipotent, omniscient and infallible, that the world is the result of God's creation which is proved by the presence of creatures, just like human work proves human existence, Mimamsa scholars asked, why does this God create the world, for what reason? Further, they added, it cannot be because of Ishvara's love to human beings because this world ‚Äì if Ishvara created it ‚Äì is imperfect and human souls are suffering in it. Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism raised numerous objections to any definition of Ishvara along with its premises, deconstructed justifications offered, and considered Ishvara concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).P. Bilimoria (2001), Hindu doubts about God: Towards Mimamsa Deconstruction, in Philosophy of Religion: Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 4, Routledge, , pages 87‚Äì106 =In Vedanta= Advaita Vedanta Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism proclaims that at the empirical level Ishvara is the cause of the universe and the one who awards the fruits of every action. He is defined as the one without likes and dislikes, as well embodied with compassion (vaiShamya NairgghruNya doSha vihInaH). Ishvara is that which is \\"free from avidya (ignorance), free from ahamkrti (ego-sense), free from bandhana (bondage)\\", a Self that is \\"pure, enlightened, liberated\\".John Koller (2012), Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, , pages 99‚Äì107 Having accepted and established Ishvara, Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the real nature of Ishvara (existence, consciousness and bliss) is non different from the real nature of an individual. This gives room in Advaita Vedanta to show the nature of Ishvara as both the material and instrumental cause of this universe and the individual who is limited in his own capacities as unreal and declare that there is oneness between the two having negated the qualities. This establishes Ishvara as 'saguNa' or with attributes from the empirical existence and 'nirguNa' from the absolute sense. This oneness is accepted only at the level of 'mukti' or ultimate realization and not at the 'vyavahara' or empirical level. At the absolute level there is no otherness nor distinction between Jiva (living being) and Ishvara, and any attempts to distinguish the two is a false idea, one based on wrong knowledge, according to Advaita Vedanta.Paul Hacker (1978), Eigentumlichkeiten dr Lehre und Terminologie Sankara: Avidya, Namarupa, Maya, Isvara, in Kleine Schriften (Editor: L. Schmithausen), Franz Steiner Verlag, Weisbaden, pages 101‚Äì109 (in German), also pages 69‚Äì99 Other Advaitin Hindu texts resonate with the monist views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is \\"above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything\\"; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself ‚Äì he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free from fears, from delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 23-25Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 547‚Äì551 Vishishtadvaita Vedanta Ishvara, in Vishishtadvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is a composite concept of dualism and non-dualism, or \\"non-dualism with differentiation\\".McCasland et al. (1969), Religions of the world, Random House, , page 471 Ishvara, Vishishtadvaitin scholars such as the 11th century Ramanuja state, is the supreme creator and synonymous with Brahman. Equated with Vishnu in Vishishtadvaita or one of his avatar, he is both the material and efficient cause, transcendent and immanent. Ishvara manifests in five forms, believe Vishishtadvaitins: para (transcendent), vyuha (emanations), vibhava (incarnations), antaryamin (dwells inside), and arca (icons). According to this sub-school, states John Grimes, Ishvara possesses six divine qualities: jnana (knowledge), bala (strength), aisvarya (lordship), sakti (power), virya (virility) and tejas (splendor).John Grimes (1996), A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, , page 143 Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita concepts provided the foundation for several Bhakti movements of Hinduism, such as those by Sri AurobindoThomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, , page 151 and has been suggested as having influenced Basava's Lingayatism.Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, , pages 243‚Äì244 Dvaita Vedanta The Dvaita (dualism) sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded by 13th century Madhva, defines Ishvara as creator God that is distinct from Jiva (individual souls in living beings).R. Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, , pages 345‚Äì347 Narayana (Vishnu) is considered to be Ishvara, and the Vaishnavism movement arose on the foundation developed by Dvaita Vedanta sub-school.Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, , page 251 Ishvara (God) is a complete, perfect and the highest reality to Dvaitins, and simultaneously the world is a separate reality for them, unlike competing thoughts in other sub-schools of Vedanta. In Dvaita sub-school, Jiva (individual soul) is different, yet dependent on Ishvara (God). Both possess the attributes of consciousness, bliss and existence, but the individual soul is considered atomic, while God is all encompassing. The attributes of Jiva struggle to manifest, while of God it is fully manifested. Madhva states there are five permutations of differences between Jiva (individual souls) and Ishvara (God): between God and souls, between God and matter, between souls and matter, between one soul and another soul, and between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative. Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with everyone and everything as well as fusion with the Universal Timeless Absolute, to the state of moksha in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, , pages 155‚Äì157 The world, called Maya, is held as the divine will of Ishvara. Jiva suffers, experiences misery and bondage, state Dvaitins, because of \\"ignorance and incorrect knowledge\\" (ajnana). Liberation occurs with the correct knowledge and attainment unto Lord Narayana. It is His grace that gives salvation according to Dvaita sub-school, which is achievable by predominance of sattva guna (moral, constructive, simple, kindness-filled life), and therefore Dvaitins must live a dharmic life while constantly remembering, deeply loving Ishvara. Achintya-Bheda-Abheda is a sub- school of Vedanta representing the philosophy of inconceivable one-ness and difference, in relation to the creation, Prakriti, and the creator, Ishvara (Krishna).Madhya 20.108-109 \\"It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of Krishna because he is the marginal energy of Krishna and a manifestation simultaneously one with and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of sunshine or fire.\\" 1.25: ' In Sanskrit achintya means 'inconceivable', bheda translates as 'difference', and abheda translates as 'one-ness'. Spirit souls (their English phrase for the Sanskrit word: jiva) are considered parts of God, and thus one with Him in quality, and yet at the same time different from Him in quantity. This is called acintya- bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference. Caitanya's philosophy of acintya-bhedƒÅbheda-tattva completed the progression to devotional theism. RƒÅmƒÅnuja had agreed with that the Absolute is one only, but he had disagreed by affirming individual variety within that oneness. Madhva had underscored the eternal duality of the Supreme and the Jƒ´va: he had maintained that this duality endures even after liberation. Caitanya, in turn, specified that the Supreme and the jƒ´vas are \\"inconceivably, simultaneously one and different\\" (acintya-bheda-abheda). =In Carvaka= CƒÅrvƒÅka, another atheist tradition in Hinduism, was materialist and a school of philosophical scepticism. They rejected all concepts of Ishvara as well as all forms of supernaturalism.Robert Flint, , Appendix Note VII - Hindu Materialism: The Charvaka System; William Blackwood, LondonV.V.

Corvinus University of Budapest is a research university oriented towards education. The university currently has an enrollment of approximately 14,500 students, offering educational programmes in business administration, economics, and social sciences. Corvinus University accepts students at six faculties and offer courses leading to degrees at the bachelor, master and doctoral level in specialisations taught in Hungarian, English, French or German. The University was listed in the top 50 in the Financial Times European Masters in Management rankings, and was the first Hungarian university mentioned among the best in the area of agriculture. Ministers of finance, chairmen of the National Bank of Hungary and prime ministers studied at Corvinus. History In 1846, J√≥zsef Industrial School opened its gates with departments for economics and trade for upper grade students. The immediate forerunner of the Corvinus University of Budapest, the Faculty of Economics of the Royal Hungarian University, was established in 1920. The faculty was an independent organization that was granted the same status as faculties of other universities. In 1934, the faculty was merged with other institutions including the University of Technology to form the Hungarian Royal Palatine Joseph University of Technology and Economics. Modern economist training began in 1948, when the Hungarian University of Economics was established as a separate universitas. Since then, the institution has undergone multiple name changes. In 1953 it was renamed Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences. In 1990 the political system changed in Hungary. After 43 years democratic and free parliamentary elections were held. Following that the name of the university was changed to the University of Economics of Budapest. In 2000, with the integration of the College of Public Administration, the institution was named Budapest University of Economic Sciences and Public Administration (BUESPA). The College of Public Administration was founded in 1977. In 2003, the three faculties of the former University of Horticulture (then part of the Szent Istv√°n University) were integrated into the BUESPA. The first predecessor of the horticulture faculties, the School for practical Gardening (1853 - 1860) was the first institution of horticultural professional training in Hungary. The school was founded and managed by the horticultural scholar and publicist Dr Ferenc Entz (1805 - 1877), who was also a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS). In 1939 an independent Royal Horticultural Academy was launched. It included three departments: agriculture, horticulture and landscape architecture. The latter was one of a kind in Hungary at the time. In 2004, the university received its present name. The name the Corvinus University of Budapest refers to the name of Corvinae (codices). Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of the most renowned libraries of the Renaissance world, established by the king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The Faculty of Public Administration was appended to the newly formed National University of Public Service on January 1, 2012. From 2013 Corvinus University of Budapest offered a Summer School program. In February 2019, the government announced that it would place Corvinus University under the newly created Maecenas Universitatis Corvini Foundation from July 2019. The foundation will be allocated 10% of the government's stake in MOL and Gedeon Richter worth HUF 380 billion at the time, with the operational expenses to be paid with the dividends from these companies. For all intents and purposes, the university will become independent of the government. Faculties As of 2016, the university has three faculties: Fa√ßade of the university * Faculty of Business Administration * Faculty of Economics * Faculty of Social Sciences Setting and architecture Main building The university is in an urban setting. The faculties operate in multiple buildings that stand in the city centre of Budapest. The university's main building ‚Äì now part of the UNESCO Heritage Site ‚Äì is located in Pest on the left bank of the Danube, next to the Great Market Hall and facing the Budapest University of Technology and Economics on the river's other bank. The main building was planned by Mikl√≥s Ybl as the Main Customs Office in Neo-Renaissance style. It was finished in 1874. The building was called \\"V√°mh√°z\\" (Customs House) and \\"F≈ëv√°mpalota\\" (Chief Customs Palace). This is also the name of the nearby avenue. The building was connected to ports of the Danube by four tunnels. It had a railroad connection. During WW2 the Hungarian, German and Soviet troops used the building as a military base. The Customs House suffered serious damage during the war. In 1948 it became the main building of the University of Economics. It underwent major renovations in 1950 and later in 1989‚Äì1990. Much of the education of the business faculties (Faculty of Business Administration, Economics, Social Sciences) takes place in the main building. This is the location of the rector's offices as well. The K√∂zrakt√°r Street building The university's K√∂zrakt√°r Street building was completed in 2007. It offers of floor space, which includes an office building and education areas. The building has community areas, and hosts the 450-seat central library of the university which contains 100,000 books and journals. Student life Lecture hall Central library at the new K√∂zrakt√°r building Seven colleges for advanced studies are connected to the university.

It is unfinished, perhaps deliberately, and comes first in group F, followed by the Franklin's interruption, prologue and tale. The Squire is the Knight's son, a novice warrior and lover with more enthusiasm than experience. His tale is an epic romance, which, if completed, would probably have been longer than rest of the Tales combined. It contains many literary allusions and a great deal of vivid description. The original source of the tale remains unknown.Michael Delahoyde, Washington State University. Accessed 14 October 2015 Plot Genghis Khan (\\"Cambyuskan\\" in Chaucer's version) leads the Mongol Empire with two sons, Algarsyf and Cambalo, and a daughter, Canace. At the twentieth anniversary of his reign, he holds a feast, and a strange knight sent from \\"the kyng of Arabe and of Inde\\" approaches him bearing gifts, a motif common in Arthurian legends. These are a brass horse with the power of teleportation, a mirror which can reveal the minds of the king's friends and enemies, a ring which confers understanding of the language of birds (as some legends say King Solomon owned), and a sword which deals deadly wounds that only its touch can heal again (both the spear of Achilles and the Holy Lance have these powers). After much learned talk of the gifts, digressing into astrology, the first part of the tale ends. A subplot of the tale deals with Canace and her ring. Eagerly rising the next morning, she goes on a walk and discovers a grieving falcon. The falcon tells Canace that she has been abandoned by her false lover, a tercelet (male hawk), who left her for a kite. (In medieval falconry, kites were birds of low status.) Canace heals the bird and builds a mew for it, painted blue for true faith within and green for falsity, with pictures of deceitful birds, outside. (This image is based on flower painted walls of the garden of the Romance of the Rose.) The second part ends with a promise of more to come involving Genghis Khan's sons and the quest of Cambalo to win Canace as his wife. (The prologue hints that Canace and her brothers commit incest, as in John Gower's version of the story.II 78-9) However, it is extremely unlikely that Chaucer ever intended to finish the tale. Instead the Franklin breaks into the very beginning of the third section with elaborate praise of the Squire's gentility‚Äîthe Franklin being something of a social climber‚Äîand proceeds to his own tale. Criticism and continuations Early critics were very admiring of the Squire's tale, and John Milton, for instance, was convinced that Chaucer had intended to conclude it. Many authors of the Elizabethan period, including Edmund Spenser, used characters from the tale in their own works, and some, like John Lane, even wrote complete continuations of it. In general, modern critics have not paid it much attention, and consider it Chaucer's way of poking gentle fun at the young Squire's love of romance literature, which frequently contains somewhat pretentious digressions, and his lack of narrative self-control. Compared to the tale told by his father, the Knight, which is formal, serious, and complete, the rambling and fantastical story shows the Squire's inexperience. Some critics see the gifts as symbolic of the powers of poetry, which the Squire is still learning to use. There is no clear source for the story; it is instead a collection of ideas and themes from many romances, as befits the Squire, a lover of such literature. The extravagant details on Eastern kingdoms come from the travel literature of the time, such as Giovanni da Pian del Carpini, Simon of St Quentin and John Mandeville. The episode of the falcon and the tercelet is similar to part of Anelida and Arcite, an early work of Chaucer's.

Serving three terms (March 4, 1825 ‚Äì March 4, 1831), Alston chaired the Committee on Elections during the 21st Congress. He declined to seek re- election in 1830 and returned to agriculture. Relationship with John Randolph Alston and John Randolph of Roanoke had an intense dislike for each other, and once had a pitched fight in a Washington boarding house, where heated words led to them throwing tableware at each other. Six years later, they fought again in a stairwell at the House after Alston loudly referred to Randolph as a \\"puppy\\". Randolph beat Alston bloody with his cane and the two had to be separated by other congressmen. Randolph was fined $20 for this breach of the peace. Death and legacy Alston died on April 10, 1837 in Halifax and is buried at his plantation home of Butterwood, near Littleton.

As a result, Fedor served the remainder of her Senate career without a leadership position. Ohio House of Representatives, Second Tenure In 2009, Fedor stated that she would be a candidate for the Ohio House of Representatives in 2010, to replace the term limited Peter Ujvagi. However, Ujvagi resigned early after he was hired as Lucas County Administrator. The appointment of Ujvagi set up what many thought was going to be a legislative shuffle, where Fedor was appointed to Ujvagi's seat, and Representative Edna Brown then appointed to Fedor's Senate seat.Dems seek applicants to hold Ujvagi House seat for 9 months However, this plan was foiled when Toledo City Councilman Joe McNamara opted also to be appointed to the Senate.

She again won the seat and was sworn into office on January 6, 2019. Initiatives, policies and positions =Human trafficking= One of Fedor's landmark legislative victories relate to human trafficking. She has stated, \\"Traffickers have walked away from the halls of justice,\\" and has vowed to help stop and continue to fight for those victimized as victims. She has received support form both former Governor Ted Strickland and current Ohio Governor John Kasich on stopping human trafficking,Sex trafficking still booming, panel laments and has successfully passed one measure. Along with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, Fedor has also introduced the safe harbor bill, which would prevent a young person with being charged with prostitution if they were victims of human trafficking. She has stated it is a critical portion of tackling the problem. =Education= Fedor has also voiced concerns over the elimination of some education measures that would eliminate all-day kindergarten requirements. While new legislation has come forth to give more communities education choices, Fedor has stated that she thinks districts were offered some choice with the waiver for all-day kindergarten that were provided in the past. =Economic issues= Fedor opposed initiatives to raise funds by selling rights to state lands, including state parks to drill for crude oil and natural gas. \\"Our picture-perfect parks in Ohio may certainly ‚Ä¶ be turned into picture-perfect toxic wastelands,she had stated. The General Assembly ultimately voted for allowing for oil exploration on state lands. =Abortion= On 25 March 2015, Teresa Fedor got so frustrated during a debate on abortion in the lower chamber of the state's legislature that she stood up and revealed that she had been raped and terminated the resulting pregnancy. \\"You don't respect my reason, my rape, my abortion, and I guarantee you there are other women who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak,\\" she said. \\"What you're doing is so fundamentally inhuman, unconstitutional, and I've sat here too long.\\" Fedor was raped many years ago, while she was in the military. The so-called Heartbeat Bill that was being discussed in the Ohio legislature at the time would have doctors test for a heartbeat in the fetus, which could be as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. If one is detected, and the doctor proceeds with the abortion, they would face felony charges. If the bill becomes law, it would ban all abortions, except when the pregnancy endangered the mother's life or health, but including cases of rape and incest. The bill passed, 50 votes to 44.

He was forced into exile from Germany in 1937 due to anti-Semitic laws in pre-war Nazi Germany. He was interned on the Isle of Man during World War II where he made several significant archaeological discoveries such as the Viking boat burial at Balladoole.  Early life  He was born in Jauer in Silesia in 1889 to a Jewish father. He was interested in prehistory from a young age and began his archaeological career while still a school boy, by joining in Carl Schuchhardt's excavations near Potsdam in 1907. In successive years Bersu dug in several European countries such as France, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece. He worked under Hubert Schmidt in the excavations at Cucuteni. Romania. During the First World War he worked for the Office for the Protection of Monuments and Collections on the Western Front. After the war he was attached to the German Armistice and Peace delegations. In 1924 he began working with the German Archaeological Institute at Frankfurt-am-Main. In 1928 he became the institution's Second Director and oversaw the acquisition of new buildings. He rose to the position of Director in 1931 and the institution became a \\"centre at which scholars from all Europe and beyond met to discuss the problems of archaeology\\" under his guidance. After the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, Bersu was forced to resign his post as a director due to his Jewish heritage.

Little Woodbury excavations  alt= Following his forced resignation from the German Archaeological Institute and the worsening anti- Semitic laws in Germany Bersu emigrated to Britain with his wife in 1937. At the invitation of British archaeologist Osbert Crawford as the president of the Prehistoric Society, Bersu conducted excavations in 1938 and 1939 at Little Woodbury in Wiltshire, introducing novel continental methods to the study of British prehistoric sites.\\"Gerhard Bersu (1889‚Äî1964)\\". The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology. Retrieved 29 Aug. 2020 The site had been first identified as a crop mark from an aerial photograph of the area, but it wasn't until Bersu's excavations that the significance of the site was realised. Bersu's systematic investigation was revolutionary for it's time in England, and his excavation helped to reinterpret earlier misconceptions of Iron Age Britain. Before Bersu's investigations, it was believed that the inhabitants of these sites lived in holes in the ground due to the discovery of dug pits from similar sites. But Bersu's identification of cereal grains and animals bones showed that these were storage pits for food, and the discovery of large postholes helped Bersu to convince British archaeologists that the inhabitants lived in a large Iron Age roundhouse that was also excavated on the site. Bersu also introduced new methods from continental Europe regarding the digging of trenches and the investigation of timber post remains that were one of the few remnants of the domestic dwellings on the site.  Internment  Douglas - the site of Hutchinson Internment Camp where Bersu was initially interned.alt=left Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Bersu and his wife were interned on the Isle of Man as \\"enemy aliens\\" with other German born residents. Initially they were separated, with neither aware of the others location, with Maria in Rushen Camp, and Bersu in Hutchinson Internment Camp, Douglas. But in October 1940, they were reunited when interned married couples were permitted to meet at Derby Castle in Douglas. Later they were able to live together at Rushen Camp, which was Europe's only internment camp for married couples during World War II. Director of the Manx Museum, Basil Megaw immediately saw the potential of having Bersu investigate some of the Isle of Man's significant archaeological sites. Bersu's fellow archaeologists and friends such Gordon Childe and Christopher Hawkes lobbied on his behalf to allow excavations on the Island to be conducted. Bersu was allowed to continue his research with the help of other internees and his wife Maria who did much of the recording of the excavation. They excavated a number of later prehistoric and Viking‚Äêage sites and several important discoveries were made at Chapel Hill at Balladoole, Ballanorris, Ronaldsway, and Ballacagan.\\"Ronaldsway Culture\\". The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology. Retrieved 29 Aug. 2020 At Balladoole, Bersu expected to excavate an Iron Age hill fort, but instead also discovered Mesolithic remains; a Bronze Age cist; a Christian keeill (a small chapel); a Christian burial ground, and a Viking Age boat burial. The discovery of additional human remains at Ballateare and Balladoole have been interpreted as examples of Viking ritual slave sacrifice. Most of Bersu's investigations on the Isle of Man were at locations accessible by public transports, as neither he nor any of the other internees had cars. As Bersu used fellow internees for the excavations, however despite the presence of armed guards, they were not permitted to use pickaxes. Instead, the digging was done with trowels. Bersu and his wife continued living and excavating on the Isle of Man after the end of World War II until 1947.

Born near Nashville, North Carolina in 1809, Arrington attended a local academy in Hilliardston and then Louisburg College. Although he studied law, he was also a significant landowner and slave owner. In 1840, Arrington was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House; he served for two terms, in the 27th and 28th Congresses.

Law career and state Senate Dann earned a B.A. in 1984 from the University of Michigan and a law degree in 1987 from Case Western Reserve University. He practiced law in Youngstown, Ohio, and became active in Democratic Party politics. Dann ran for the Ohio state Senate in the district then comprising Trumbull and Geauga counties. He finished third in the party primary behind eventual winner Tim Ryan and a local township trustee. From 2001 to 2002, Dann served as a member of the Liberty Local School District board of education. After Ryan won election to the Ohio State Senate in 2002, Dann convinced the state Senate's Democratic caucus to appoint him to fill the balance of Ryan's term. He easily won election to a full term in 2004. He was reprimanded in 2004 by the Ohio Supreme Court for handling a 2002 alimony case without proper preparation. Dann was a leading figure in the exposure of a variety of ethics and criminal scandals in the administration of Republican Governor Bob Taft, who became the first sitting governor in Ohio history to plead guilty to a crime. Dann was a leading critic of \\"Coingate,\\" an investment plan in which $50 million of the state's workers compensation reserve fund was given to Republican Tom Noe, a politically connected coin dealer. When the Coingate scandal broke, Taft, who was a regular golf partner of Noe's, denied having knowledge of the Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC) decision to invest money in Noe's coin funds. Dann demanded, then sued to see memos, e-mails, and other communications transmitted between Gov. Taft's office and the BWC. Dann was a vociferous critic of then-Attorney General Jim Petro, a Republican, who had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission more than two years earlier that the SEC had serious reservations about investment practices at the BWC. Dann charged that Petro ignored those warnings and the misuse of funds at the agency continued unabated until the Toledo Blade and Dann began to expose the corruption. Attorney General Dann announced his candidacy for Attorney General of Ohio on November 14, 2005, saying he would use the office to both help local police and prosecutors deal with street crime and to actively and aggressively pursue white collar criminals. Dann won 71% of the vote in the Democratic primary against former Cleveland Law Director Subodh Chandra. He won the general election in November 2006 by upsetting Ohio State Auditor Betty Montgomery, a former attorney general. In the general-election campaign, Montgomery tried to distance herself from the scandals of the Taft administration, while criticizing Dann for wanting to use the attorney general's office as a platform for activism. In a television advertisement, the Montgomery campaign attacked Dann for the above-mentioned 2004 reprimand and for defending a man convicted of showing nude pictures to children. Dann responded to the latter attack by saying he was simply doing his job as an attorney. Dann received 2.04 million votes to 1.83 million for Montgomery, a margin of 52% to 48%. He ran up huge margins in traditionally Republican areas and also won bellwether counties such as Franklin and Stark. Before her defeat by Dann, Montgomery had never lost a statewide election and had been the top Republican vote-getter in the previous two non-presidential statewide contests. He was sworn in as the 47th Ohio Attorney General on January 8, 2007. Controversies Dann had been questioned by some for supporting Capri Cafaro's successful bid to fill Dann's unexpired term in the state Senate. Cafaro, heiress to part of the Cafaro shopping-mall empire, had never won election to office. In addition, Cafaro's father, J. J. Cafaro, had pleaded guilty in 2001 to bribing then-Congressman Jim Traficant to push legislation that would benefit his aviation-equipment company. Capri, then in her early 20s, was president of the aviation company but was not charged with any wrongdoing. In a related trial, Capri testified she had never conspired with Traficant. As of October 18, 2006, the Cafaro family had contributed $30,500 to Dann's campaign for attorney general, in addition to the $26,000 they had donated to his state Senate campaigns. Of that money, $10,000 came from J. J. Cafaro. Dann defended his recommendation of Capri Cafaro by saying he believed she was the only qualified candidate to replace him. Dann faced criticism from the Mansfield News Journal and others for telling (Warren, Ohio) Tribune Chronicle reporter Steve Oravecz to \\"go ... fuck yourself\\" at a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Dann was upset about an article Oravecz had written entitled \\"Locals with ties to Dann get jobs\\". The article described how two people with ties to Dann's election campaign, including a woman who he raised as a daughter, were given state jobs. The incident was caught on tape. According to the Associated Press, the Attorney General's office missed a legal deadline to join an appeal of a Medicaid- related court decision the state government opposes. The deadline for filing the documents was Dann's inauguration day. The failure to join the appeal does not prevent the state from filing briefs in the case. =Scandal and resignation= A sexual harassment scandal arose during Dann's tenure as attorney general, eventually leading to his resignation. In April 2008, Dann placed Communications Director Leo Jennings on leave, pending the outcome of an ongoing investigation in his office. The investigation focused on allegations of sexual harassment, filed by two women Cindy Stankoski and Vanessa Stout, who worked in Dann‚Äôs office under the supervision of Anthony Gutierrez. Jennings and Gutierrez were non-attorney friends of Dann from Youngstown; the three shared a condominium in Columbus. Jennings joined Gutierrez, Dann‚Äôs director of general services, on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation. The female employees alleged Gutierrez, who was paid $87,500 a year, repeatedly sexually harassed them. A statement from Dann released to reporters gave no details on what led to Jennings being included in the investigation. It said only: \\"This action comes as a result of new information received over the weekend related to the ongoing investigation into charges of sexual harassment.\\" Dann agreed to conditionally release emails between himself and his former scheduler, Jessica Utovich. Utovich, 28, began as Dann's scheduler, but was transferred to the position of director of travel in late 2007. Upon being transferred, Utovich received a 27% pay raise. =Extramarital affair= On May 2, 2008, following the firing and resignation of a number of his aides in a sexual harassment scandal, Dann admitted he had an extramarital affair with an unidentified subordinate in his office. However, he initially refused to resign saying his admission and punishment were enough. In the wake of these admissions a number of Ohio papers called for Dann to resign and the Tribune Chronicle even apologized to its readers for their endorsement of Dann during the 2006 election. On May 4, 2008, the three largest Ohio newspapers ran editorials condemning Dann. The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio) opined \\"Dann has turned the attorney general's office into a laughingstock\\" and \\"it's impossible to see how he can recover\\" The Columbus Dispatch said Dann was \\"not fit to serve\\", and the Cincinnati Enquirer called for Dann's resignation. The Plain Dealer had previously reported that Republicans said that if Dann doesn't step down, they could try to impeach him. On the evening of May 5, Democratic Governor Strickland issued a statement which appeared to support Dann's impeachment should he decide not to resign. Dann showed no interest in departure, even after Strickland's statement. On May 5, 2008, the Columbus Dispatch reported that seven separate investigations were either underway or being considered responsive to misconduct at the Attorney General's office. On May 10, 2008, the Ohio Democratic Party voted to remove their endorsement of Dann, remove him of his membership in the Ohio Democratic Party Executive Committee, and called for his immediate resignation as attorney general.Dems pull endorsement .

In March 2009, Dann and his campaign were each fined $1000 by the Ohio Elections Commission for violating campaign-finance laws by using his political account for personal cell phones for his family and for security renovations to his Youngstown-area home. In June 2009, Dann reached a plea agreement with the inspector general of the Elections Commission, Thomas P. Charles, to plead guilty to a single violation of misuse of campaign funds, which he used for travel expenses for family members to San Francisco for a vacation that was to be packaged with a political fundraiser, and pay another fine of $1000 which the Commission agreed to accept in a 5 to 1 vote. Charles filed complaints against Dann with the Elections Commission on accusations of illegally using his political account to pay Leo Jennings who used the money to pay for rent and utilities for the condominium they shared with Anthony Gutierrez. Gutierrez is scheduled to go on trial in August regarding different allegations relating to his tenure in Dann's office. Personal Dann's former spouse, Alyssa Lenhoff, is director of the journalism program at Youngstown State University. Lenhoff won several awards for investigative reporting at the Tribune Chronicle in Warren, Ohio. Lenhoff's former partner at the Tribune, Ed Simpson, was Dann's chief of staff until he resigned under fire on May 2, 2008. Dann was a Sigma Chi at the University of Michigan. Dann and Lenhoff have three children. Lenhoff filed for divorce from Dann on April 15, 2010, after Dann was caught having an extramarital affair. Their divorce was finalized in July 2010. Dann was suspended from the practice of law by the Ohio Supreme Court effective November 20, 2012, and was reinstated effective June 11, 2013. Dann now has a private legal practice in Cleveland, Ohio, reportedly specializing in combating home foreclosures.

This technology has been exploited in a variety of spacecraft by the European Space Agency, the Japanese Space Agency, Indian Space Research Organisation and NASA. SEP has a significantly higher specific impulse than normal chemical rockets, thus requiring less propellant mass to be launched with a spacecraft and it has been evaluated for missions to Mars.Solar Electric Propulsion for Mars Exploration NASA, 2005-01-08. Overview Solar electric propulsion combines solar panels on spacecraft and one or more electric thrusters, used in tandem. There are many different types of electric thrusters, including a so-called ion thruster, a term that is often incorrectly used to describe all types of electric thrusters. It is also possible to generate electricity from the Sun without using photovoltaic panels, such as with solar concentrators and a Stirling engine. A 50 kilowatt SEP system was studied in the 2010s for a mission to an asteroid. In February 2012 NASA awarded a contract for a Solar Electric Propulsion Flight System . An example of work on this type of technology is Advanced Electric Propulsion System. The NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) ion engine has been used with photovoltaic solar panels, which was tested on the Deep Space 1 mission along with Solar Concentrator Arrays (Launched in 1998 as part of the New Millennium Program) SEP has been studied as a technology for a mission to Mars. In particular the high specific impulse of the ion engines could lower overall mass and avoid having to use nuclear technology for power when coupled with solar panels.A 1998 study for SEP for a human mission suggest that a human-sized spacecraft would need 600 to 800 kilowatts of electrical power coupled with ion engines with a specific impulse of 2000 to 2500 seconds.[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050181421.pdf Mission examples * BepiColombo mission to Mercury (launched) BepiColombo Fact Sheet European Space Agency, 2010-07-05. * Dawn asteroids mission (launched) * Deep Space 1 asteroid and comet mission (launched) * Hayabusa asteroid mission (launched) * PSLV-C45 EMISAT Mission (launched) * Asteroid Redirect Mission (cancelled) * Lunar Gateway (proposed) * Psyche asteroid mission (planned) Electric propulsion technologies *Resistojet rocket *Ion thruster **High Power Electric Propulsion *Pulsed plasma thruster *Hall-effect thruster *Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster *Field-emission electric propulsion *Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASMIR) :Ion engines See also *Batteries in space *Liquid-propellant rocket *List of spacecraft with electric propulsion *Nuclear electric rocket *Solar panels on spacecraft *Solar sail *Solar thermal rocket *Sterling engine References Solar power and space Spacecraft propulsion ","title":"Solar electric propulsion"},{"id":"1201890","text":"The ' refers to the assassination of Oda Nobunaga at the Honn≈ç-ji temple in Kyoto on 21 June 1582. Nobunaga was betrayed by his general Akechi Mitsuhide during his campaign to consolidate centralized power in Japan under his authority. Mitsuhide ambushed the unprotected Nobunaga at Honn≈ç-ji and his eldest son Oda Nobutada at Nij≈ç Palace which resulted in both committing seppuku. Nobunaga was avenged by his retainer Toyotomi Hideyoshi who defeated Mitsuhide in the Battle of Yamazaki, paving the way for Hideyoshi's supremacy over Japan. Mitsuhide's motive for assassinating Nobunaga is unknown and there are multiple theories for his betrayal. Context By 1582, Oda Nobunaga was at the height of his power as the most powerful daimy≈ç in Japan during his campaign of unification under his authority. Nobunaga had destroyed the Takeda clan earlier that year at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, and had central Japan firmly under his control, with his only rivals, the M≈çri clan, the Uesugi clan, and the H≈çj≈ç clan, each weakened by internal affairs. After the death of M≈çri Motonari, his grandson Terumoto strove only to maintain the status quo, aided by his two uncles, as per Motonari's will. H≈çj≈ç Ujiyasu, a renowned strategist and domestic manager, had also died, leaving his less prominent son Ujimasa in place. Finally, the death of Uesugi Kenshin left the Uesugi clan, devastated also by an internal conflict between his two adopted sons, weaker than before. It was at this point that Nobunaga began sending his generals aggressively into all directions to continue his military expansion. Nobunaga ordered Hashiba Hideyoshi to attack the M≈çri clan; Niwa Nagahide to prepare for an invasion of Shikoku; Takigawa Kazumasu to watch the H≈çj≈ç clan from K≈çzuke Province and Shinano Province; and Shibata Katsuie to invade Echigo Province, the home domain of the Uesugi clan. At the same time, Nobunaga also invited his ally Tokugawa Ieyasu to tour the Kansai region in celebration of the demise of the Takeda clan. Around this time, Nobunaga received a request for reinforcements from Hashiba Hideyoshi, whose forces were stuck besieging the M≈çri-controlled Takamatsu Castle. Nobunaga then parted ways with Ieyasu, who went on to tour the rest of Kansai while Nobunaga himself made preparations to aid Hashiba in the frontline. Nobunaga ordered Akechi Mitsuhide also to go to Hideyoshi's aid and travelled to Honn≈ç-ji temple in Kyoto, his usual resting place when he stopped by in the capital. Nobunaga was unprotected at Honn≈ç-ji, deep within his territory, with the only people he had around him being court officials, merchants, upper-class artists, and dozens of servants. Akechi's treachery Upon receiving the order, Mitsuhide returned to Sakamoto Castle and moved to his base in Tanba Province. Around this time, Mitsuhide had a session of renga with several prominent poets, where he made clear his intentions of uprising against Nobunaga. Mitsuhide saw an opportunity to act, when not only was Nobunaga resting in Honn≈ç-ji and unprepared for an attack, but all the other major daimy≈ç and the bulk of Nobunaga's army were occupied in other parts of the country. Mitsuhide led his army toward Kyoto under the pretense of following the order of Nobunaga. It was not the first time that Nobunaga had demonstrated his modernized and well- equipped troops in Kyoto, so the march toward Kyoto did not raise any suspicion from Mitsuhide's men. As they were crossing Katsura River, Mitsuhide announced to his troops that . Before dawn, the Akechi army had the Honn≈ç-ji temple surrounded in a coup d'√©tat. Nobunaga and his servants and bodyguards resisted, but they realized it was futile against the overwhelming numbers of Akechi troops. Nobunaga then, with the help of his young page, Mori Ranmaru, committed seppuku. Reportedly, Nobunaga's last words were \\"Ran, don't let them come in ...\\" to Ranmaru, who then set the temple on fire as Nobunaga requested so that no one would be able to get his head. Ranmaru then followed suit, committing seppuku himself. His loyalty and devotion makes him a revered figure in Japanese history. Nobunaga's remains were never found, a fact often speculated about by writers and historians. After capturing Honn≈ç-ji, Mitsuhide attacked Nobunaga's eldest son and heir, Oda Nobutada, who was staying at the nearby Nij≈ç Palace. Nobutada also committed seppuku. Mitsuhide tried to persuade Oda vassals in the vicinity of Kyoto to recognize him as the new master of former Oda territories. Then, Mitsuhide entered Nobunaga's Azuchi Castle east of Kyoto and began sending messages to the Imperial Court to boost his position and force the court to recognize his authority as well.  Reasons for the coup Akechi Mitsuhide's reasons for the coup are a mystery and have been a source of controversy and speculation. Although there have been several theories, the reason the historian Kuwata Tadachika put forth was that Mitsuhide bore a personal grudge. Other theories maintain that Mitsuhide acted out of fear, had the ambition to take over Japan, was simply acting to protect the Imperial Court (whose authority Nobunaga did not respect), or was trying to remove the iconoclastic revolutionary. Another theory is that Mitsuhide did not enjoy the cruelty of Nobunaga. Many think it was a combination of at least some of the above assumed reasons. When Nobunaga invited Tokugawa Ieyasu to Azuchi Castle, Akechi was the official in charge of catering to the needs of Ieyasu's group. He was later removed from this post for unknown reasons. One story spoke of Nobunaga yelling at him in front of the guests for serving rotten fish. Another story tells that when Nobunaga gave Akechi the order to assist Hashiba Hideyoshi, it was somehow hinted that Akechi would lose his current territories and would have to fight for land which was not even under Oda control yet. As Nobunaga had sent two senior retainers under him, Sakuma Nobumori and Hayashi Hidesada, into exile for poor performance, Akechi might have thought that he could suffer a similar fate. Akechi was already in his early fifties, and some believe he might have felt insecure about such a grim future. Furthermore, when invading Tanba Province, Akechi Mitsuhide supposedly sent his mother as hostage to Hatano Hideharu, the castellan of Yakami Castle, to convince him to surrender. Nobunaga, however, had Hatano Hideharu executed, and this action caused former Hatano retainers to kill Akechi‚Äôs mother. Akechi Mitsuhide felt humiliated and depressed by this and eventually decided to kill his master. This story, however, began to circulate only during the Edo period, and is of dubious historical origin. Lu√≠s Fr√≥is wrote that Mitsuhide liked to use treachery and diversion as his strategy. He also suggested daimy≈çs disliked Mitsuhide because he did not belong to the fudai clan which had served his master's clan for a long time. Many books said Nobunaga insulted and kicked, or even forced Mitsuhide to drink sake at a party, even though he was not a heavy drinker. Before Akechi began his march toward Chugoku, he held a renga session at the shrine on Mount Atago. The beginning line, Toki wa ima, ame ga shita shiru satsuki kana (), translates to \\"The time is now, the fifth month when the rain falls.\\" However, there are several homonyms in the line, such that it could be taken as a double entendre. An alternate meaning, without changing any of the pronunciations, would be: . Thus it has also been translated as \\"Now is the time to rule the world: It's the fifth month!\\" In this case, the word toki, which means \\"time\\" in the first version, sounds identical to Akechi's ancestral family name, \\"Toki\\" (). It is also believed Akechi may have been manipulated by Ieyasu or Hideyoshi, since it had clear prospects of profit for both of them (Hideyoshi ruled the country, and Ieyasu became the number two, avenging his wife and child). Oda Nobutaka, third son of Nobunaga, wrote a poem before his death cursing Toyotomi Hideyoshi under his court title of Hashiba Chikuzen(-no-kami), which he used before becoming Kampaku. After the Honn≈ç-ji Incident Quickly making peace with the M≈çri clan, Hideyoshi headed to Kyoto, joined by Niwa Nagahide and Oda Nobutaka in Osaka. Marching toward Kyoto, he defeated Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki, and Mitsuhide himself was killed by bandits as he tried to flee. With the help of his retainer and ninja leader Hattori Hanz≈ç, Ieyasu first toured Sakai, then fled through several provinces and crossed the mountains of Iga Province, finally reaching the shore in Ise Province. He returned to his home Mikawa Province by sea, and it took him so long that by the time he consolidated his position, Hideyoshi had already had most of Nobunaga's territories under firm control. Takigawa Kazumasu suddenly faced the assault of the H≈çj≈ç clan and lost most of his land there, a defeat that cost him his previous prestige in the Oda clan. Shibata Katsuie and his forces in the north were bogged down by an Uesugi counterattack in Echizen Province, and remained unable to act for quite a while. He would later fall in the Battle of Shizugatake against Hideyoshi a year later. The fact that no one else had the chance, resources, or ability to act decisively ensured Hashiba Hideyoshi's supremacy and spiritual inheritance of Oda Nobunaga's legacy.

Actin filaments are linked to Œ±-actinin and to membrane through vinculin. The head domain of vinculin associates to E-cadherin via Œ±-, Œ≤-, and Œ≥-catenins. The tail domain of vinculin binds to membrane lipids and to actin filaments. Cadherins (named for \\"calcium-dependent adhesion\\") are a type of cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that is important in the formation of adherens junctions to bind cells with each other. Cadherins are a class of type-1 transmembrane proteins. They are dependent on calcium (Ca2+) ions to function, hence their name. Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular cadherin domains, whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic tail associates with numerous adaptor and signaling proteins, collectively referred to as the cadherin adhesome. The cadherin superfamily includes cadherins, protocadherins, desmogleins, desmocollins, and more. In structure, they share cadherin repeats, which are the extracellular Ca2+-binding domains. There are multiple classes of cadherin molecule, each designated with a prefix (in general, noting the type of tissue with which it is associated). It has been observed that cells containing a specific cadherin subtype tend to cluster together to the exclusion of other types, both in cell culture and during development. For example, cells containing N-cadherin tend to cluster with other N-cadherin- expressing cells. However, it has been noted that the mixing speed in the cell culture experiments can have an effect on the extent of homotypic specificity. In addition, several groups have observed heterotypic binding affinity (i.e., binding of different types of cadherin together) in various assays. One current model proposes that cells distinguish cadherin subtypes based on kinetic specificity rather than thermodynamic specificity, as different types of cadherin homotypic bonds have different lifetimes.  Structure  Domain organization of different types of cadherins Cadherins are synthesized as polypeptides and undergo many post-translational modifications to become the proteins which mediate cell-cell adhesion and recognition. These polypeptides are approximately 720‚Äì750 amino acids long. Each cadherin has a small C-terminal cytoplasmic component, a transmembrane component, and the remaining bulk of the protein is extra-cellular (outside the cell). The transmembrane component consists of single chain glycoprotein repeats. Because cadherins are Ca2+ dependent, they have five tandem extracellular domain repeats that act as the binding site for Ca2+ ions. Their extracellular domain interacts in two separate trans dimer conformations: strand-swap dimers (S-dimers) and X-dimers. To date, over 100 types of cadherins in humans have been identified and sequenced. The functionality of cadherins relies upon the formation of two identical subunits, known as homodimers. The homodimeric cadherins create cell-cell adhesion with cadherins present in the membranes of other cells through changing conformation from cis-dimers to trans-dimers. Once the cell- cell adhesion between cadherins present in the cell membranes of two different cells has formed, adherens junctions can then be made when protein complexes, usually composed of Œ±-, Œ≤-, and Œ≥-catenins, bind to the cytoplasmic portion of the cadherin.  Function  =Development= Cadherins behave as both receptors and ligands for other molecules. During development, their behavior assists in properly positioning cells: they are responsible for the separation of the different tissue layers, and for cellular migration. In the very early stages of development, E-cadherin (epithelial cadherin) is most greatly expressed. Many cadherins are specified for specific functions in the cell, and they are differentially expressed in a developing embryo. For example, during neurulation, when the neural plate is forming in the embryo, the tissues residing near the cranial neural folds have decreased N-cadherin expression. Conversely, the expression of the N-cadherins remains unchanged in the other regions of the neural tube that is located on the anterior-posterior axis of the vertebrate. The expression of the different types of cadherins in the cell are varying dependent upon the specific differentiation and specification of the organism during development. Cadherins play a vital role in the migration of cells through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which requires cadherins to form adherents junctions with neighboring cells. In neural crest cells, which are transient cells that arise in the developing organism during gastrulation and function in the patterning of the vertebrate body plan, the cadherins are necessary to allow migration of cells to form tissues or organs. In addition, cadherins responsible in the EMT event in early development have also been shown to be critical in the reprogramming of specified adult cells into a pluripotent state, forming induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). After development, cadherins play a role in maintaining cell and tissue structure, and in cellular movement. Regulation of cadherin expression can occur through promoter methylation among other epigenetic mechanisms. =Tumour metastasis= The E-cadherin‚Äìcatenin complex plays a key role in cellular adhesion; loss of this function has been associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis of tumors. The suppression of E-cadherin expression is regarded as one of the main molecular events responsible for dysfunction in cell-cell adhesion, which can lead to local invasion and ultimately tumor development. Because of its important role tumor suppression, E-cadherin is also referred to as the \\"suppressor of invasion\\". = Correlation to cancer = It has been discovered that cadherins and other additional factors are correlated to the formation and growth of some cancers and how a tumor continues to grow. The E-cadherins also known as the epithelial cadherins on the surface of one cell can bind with those of the same kind on another to form bridges. It is indicated that the loss of the cell adhesion molecule E cadherin is causally involved in the formation of epithelial types of cancers such as carcinomas. The changes in any type of cadherin expression may not only control tumor cell adhesion but also affect signal transduction leading to the cancer cells growing uncontrollably. In epithelial cell cancers, disrupted cell to cell adhesion might lead to the development of secondary malignant growths that are distant from the primary site of cancer, can result from the abnormalities in the expression of E-cadherins or its associated catenins. CAMs such as the cadherin glycoproteins normally function as the glue that holds cells together and act as important mediators of cell to cell interactions. E-cadherins, on the surface of all epithelial cells, are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with catenins in the cytoplasm. Thus, anchored to the cytoskeleton, E-cadherins on the surface of one cell can bind with those on another to form bridges. In epithelial cell cancers, disrupted cell-cell adhesion that might lead to metastases can result from abnormalities in the expression of E-cadherin or its associated catenins. Correlation to endometrium and embryogenesis This family of glycoproteins are responsible for calcium-dependent mechanism of intracellular adhesion. E-cadherins are crucial in embryogenesis during several processes, including gastrulation, neurulation and organogenesis. Furthermore, suppression of E-cadherin impairs intracellular adhesion. The levels of this molecule increases during the luteic phase, while its expression is regulated by progesterone with endometrial calcitonin. Types There are said to be over 100 different types of cadherins found in vertebrates, which can be classified into four groups: classical, desmosomal, protocadherins, and unconventional. This large amount of diversity is accomplished by having multiple cadherin encoding genes combined with alternative RNA splicing mechanisms.

It had come from Vancouver, Canada through Canadian Pacific Flight 003 and was transiting through the airport for Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok, Thailand. It was established that Canadian khalistanis, Sikh extremists, wished for the bomb to explode at the same time as another bombing just one hour later of Air India Flight 182 over the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Ireland, but had failed to account for daylight saving time. The bomb inadvertently had exploded even earlier than what the perpetrators had planned due to being manhandled at the airport. If the plan had worked, then the bomb would have exploded inside Air India Flight 301 instead of the airport. Extensive analysis by the Japanese investigators identified bomb parts through serial numbers and narrowed the pieces to less than 2000 possible electronic tuners of an older model shipped to Vancouver, allowing Canadian police to identify a single person who had bought this older model recently. At the same time in the inquiry to the Air India Flight 182 bombing, investigators had identified that the man checked-in luggage without boarding the plane. Canadian investigators were able to establish that khalistanis, Sikh extremists, who were living in Canada at that time were responsible for both bombings, but only Inderjit Singh Reyat, who lived in Duncan, British Columbia, was convicted in Canadian court. He was found guilty in 1991 in the Narita bombing. In 2003, shortly before the start of the Air India trial, he made a plea bargain on reduced charges and a promise of testimony against other suspects. He made the bombs used in both attacks.  Timeline of the incident  On June 22, 1985, the bags of a passenger named L. Singh were checked in at Vancouver for Canadian Pacific Airlines (CP Air) 003 to New Tokyo International Airport in Narita, Japan, near Tokyo. This bag was interlined to Air India Flight 301 leaving for Don Muang International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand. L. Singh was assigned seat 38H. At 2037 UTC, CP Air Flight 003 (named Empress of Australia), departed Vancouver; no L. Singh was on board. At 0541 UTC (now June 23), CP Air 003 arrived in Tokyo Narita 14 minutes early. At 0619 UTC, a piece of luggage that had come from CP Air 3 exploded as it was being transferred to Air India Flight 301; the explosion killed two Japanese baggage handlers (Hideo Asano and Hideharu Koda) in Narita Airport and injured four other people. At 0714 UTC, Air India Flight 182 exploded in mid-air off the west coast of Ireland, falling into the sea. All 329 people on board were killed. Investigation by Canada has revealed connections between the two bombings. At 0805 UTC, Air India Flight 301 left Narita and arrived in Thailand unscathed and with no incidents. February 1988 ‚Äì Inderjit Singh Reyat is arrested by West Midlands Police in Coventry, United Kingdom. December 8, 1989 ‚Äì The British government agrees to extradite Reyat to Canada, following a lengthy court battle and trial. May 10, 1991 ‚Äì Inderjit Singh Reyat receives a ten-year sentence after being convicted of two counts of manslaughter terms and four explosives charges relating to the Narita Airport 1985 bombing. Second bombing Fifty-five minutes after, at 08:14 Irish time, Air India Flight 182 exploded mid-air and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Ireland, killing 329 people. Canadian security forces believe that the incidents were related, as noted in a 2010 report by a government commission. They were both developed by Babbar Khalsa, the Sikh separatist group operating in Canada. Investigators believe the bombings were intended to be simultaneous, but the terrorist planners were not aware that while Canada observes daylight saving time, Japan does not. Trials The trial for the Narita bombing took place in Canada in 1991. The only man convicted of any involvement in the bombings was Inderjit Singh Reyat, a British Columbia resident who had built the bombs used. He received a ten-year sentence of two counts of manslaughter and four explosives charges after being found guilty in May 1991 of the Narita bombing in federal court in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 2003, weeks before the start of the Air India Flight 182 trial, Reyat made a deal with prosecutors. In exchange for pleading guilty to the charge of manslaughter in the Flight 182 bombing, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also had to testify against the two other men tried in Canada for these incidents, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri. Justice Ian Josephson acquitted them, as he believed that the prosecutors had not been able to meet the standard of proof \\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" In reading the verdicts of Malik and Bagri, Justice Josephson commented about Reyat's testimony at their trial: > Even the most sympathetic of listeners could only conclude, as do I, that > his evidence was patently and pathetically fabricated in an attempt to > minimize his involvement in his crime to an extreme degree, while refusing > to reveal relevant information he clearly possesses. His hollow expression > of remorse for his crime must have been a bitter pill for the families of > the victims. In 2006 Crown Counsel in British Columbia announced they would be charging Reyat with perjury, based on his testimony at the Air India Flight 182 trial. It is alleged that he committed perjury 27 times during his testimony. In 2008, the court granted bail; he had already served 20 years in jail since his first arrest. The trial on perjury charges was scheduled for 2009. He was convicted of perjury in 2011 and sentenced to nine years, with 17 months' credit for time already served.

Written by Judy Burns and Chet Richards and directed by Herb Wallerstein, it was first broadcast on November 15, 1968. In the episode, Captain Kirk is caught between dimensions while the crew of the Enterprise works to retrieve him. All the while, the Tholians are weaving a destructive energy web around the Enterprise. Plot The starship USS Enterprise enters an uncharted region of space searching for her sister ship, the USS Defiant. Sensors detect fractures in space, and a power loss affects all systems. Defiant is found adrift, and Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Navigator Ensign Chekov transport across wearing environmental suits for protection. Aboard Defiant, they find the crew dead, apparently having killed one another. The boarding party discovers that Defiant is slowly fading out of our universe. At one point, McCoy passes his hand through an almost invisible man and a table. With limited transporter functionality due to the unexplained malfunctions, Kirk orders his men to return to Enterprise first. The beaming takes longer than usual, and as Chief Engineer Scott tries to beam Kirk aboard, the Defiant vanishes. Spock determines that the local space is experiencing periods of \\"interphase\\", when two parallel dimensions touch each other and objects in one can move to the other, and believes Kirk will reappear during the next one. As he explains the situation, Chekov lashes out in anger, a symptom that McCoy believes is due to their proximity to Defiant. Spock, however, refuses to move the ship, fearful of disrupting local space, which could result in the loss of the Captain. Loskene, one of the Tholian aliens With two hours before the next interphase, the Enterprise is approached by a small, unfamiliar ship. Its captain, Commander Loskene of the Tholian Assembly, asserts that Enterprise has violated Tholian space and must leave. Spock persuades Loskene to wait one hour and fifty-three minutes. When the time is up, Kirk does not reappear, and Spock concludes that the arrival of the Tholian ship disrupted the interphase. When the Enterprise is attacked by Loskene, McCoy again urges Spock to leave, believing Kirk is lost. Spock chooses to return fire and the Tholian ship is disabled, but the Enterprise takes damage as well. Scott warns that because of the damage he cannot guarantee that he can hold their position. A second Tholian ship joins the first, and the two begin weaving an energy web that cages the Enterprise. Spock determines that if the web is completed before repairs are done, they will be unable to escape. Spock conducts a memorial service for Kirk, during which another man goes insane. Spock and McCoy then view a tape left by Kirk, to be played in the event of his death, which implores the two of them to work together for the benefit of the ship. Lieutenant Uhura and Scott both report seeing ghostly manifestations of Kirk. Finally, the apparition is seen on the bridge; Kirk is still in his environmental suit and appears to be urging Spock to \\"hurry\\". With the Tholian web nearly complete, McCoy dispenses an antidote to the effects of the local space, and Spock determines the time of Kirk's next appearance. They lock onto Kirk's coordinates, and Spock orders the activation of the ship's engines, which carries them through the spatial rift to a point 2.72 parsecs away. Kirk is brought along by the transporter lock, and beamed aboard just as his oxygen runs out. On the bridge, Kirk questions Spock and McCoy about their handling of the emergency, particularly concerning the tape with his final orders. McCoy claims they did not have time to watch it, Spock confirms that they were very busy, and Kirk accepts their answers. Subsequent appearances The completed Tholian web around the alternate universe ISS Enterprise (NX-01) from Star Trek: Enterprise. In a two-part episode of Star Trek: Enterprise called \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\", it is revealed that the Defiant has reappeared in the Mirror Universe of Archer's time, where it is first salvaged by the Tholians and then stolen by the Terran Empire. The Defiant bridge is recreated in precise detail, even to the positions of the dead crewmen. Reception In 2015, SyFy ranked this episode as one of the top ten essential Star Trek original series Spock episodes. In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter rated \\"The Tholian Web\\" the 75th best television episode of all Star Trek franchise television shows prior to Star Trek: Discovery including live-action and animated series but not counting the films. A 2018 Star Trek binge-watching guide by Den of Geek, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series. Popular culture In 1997 it became known that United States Customs investigators had used the name \\"Tholian Web\\" for a technique for embroiling child porn enthusiasts in internet conversations to trick them into illegal activity. By 1997 it had triggered hundreds of prosecutions. In 2010 Gerry W. Beyer, of the Texas Tech University School of Law, cited a video recording introduced in this episode, which Captain Kirk, Captain of the starship Enterprise, had left for his two most senior officers to play in the event of his death, urging them to overcome their personal animosity. Beyer described this fictional recording as one of the first recorded instances of what he called a \\"video-will\\". Political scientists have compared the metaphor of the entrapment in this episode with the deep challenges politicians and administrators feel when confronted with competing factions and lobby groups.

The Journal-American was the product of a merger between two New York newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst: The New York American (originally the New York Journal, renamed American in 1901), a morning paper, and the New York Evening Journal, an afternoon paper. Both were published by Hearst from 1895 to 1937. The American and Evening Journal merged in 1937. The Journal-American was a publication with several editions in the afternoon and evening. Circulation war Joseph Pulitzer's younger brother Albert founded the New York Morning Journal in 1882. John R. McLean briefly acquired the paper in 1895, but quickly sold it to Hearst.(23 June 1937) (Hearst to Merge New York Papers: American will cease as separate publication, Miami News (Associated Press story) Hearst founded the Evening Journal about a year later. Hearst entered into a circulation war with the New York World, the newspaper run by his former mentor Joseph Pulitzer and from whom he stole the cartoonists George McManus and Richard F. Outcault. In October 1896, Outcault defected to Hearst's New York Journal. Because Outcault had failed in his effort to copyright The Yellow Kid both newspapers published versions of the comic feature with George Luks providing the New York World with their version after Outcault left.Ian Gordon (historian), Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890-1945. (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998), p. 33 The Yellow Kid was one of the first comic strips to be printed in color and gave rise to the phrase yellow journalism, used to describe the sensationalist and often exaggerated articles, which helped, along with a one-cent price tag, to greatly increase circulation of the newspaper. Many believed that as part of this, aside from any nationalistic sentiment, Hearst may have helped to initiate the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898 with lurid exposes of Spanish atrocities against insurgents and foreign journalists. Comics In the early 1900s, Hearst weekday morning and afternoon papers around the country featured scattered black-and-white comic strips, and on January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation's first full daily comics page in the Evening Journal. On January 12, 1913, McManus launched his Bringing Up Father comic strip. The comics expanded into two full pages daily and a 12-page Sunday color section with leading King Features Syndicate strips. By the mid-1940s, the newspaper's Sunday comics included Bringing Up Father, Blondie, a full-page Prince Valiant, Flash Gordon, The Little King, Buz Sawyer, Feg Murray's Seein' Stars, Tim Tyler's Luck, Gene Ahern's Room and Board and The Squirrel Cage, The Phantom, Jungle Jim, Tillie the Toiler, Little Annie Rooney, Little Iodine, Bob Green's The Lone Ranger, Believe It or Not!, Uncle Remus, ', Donald Duck, Tippie, Right Around Home, Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, and The Katzenjammer Kids.A Week in New York April 1945. Tad Dorgan, known for his boxing and dog cartoons, as well as the comic character Judge Rummy, joined the Journal's staff in 1905. In 1922, the Evening Journal introduced a Saturday color comics tabloid with strips not seen on Sunday, and this 12-page tabloid continued for decades, offering Popeye, Grandma, Don Tobin's The Little Woman, Mandrake the Magician, Don Flowers' Glamor Girls, Grin and Bear It, and Buck Rogers, and other strips.DailyINK Rube Goldberg also became a cartoonist with the Journal-American. Reporters The Evening Journal was home to famed investigative reporter Nellie Bly, who began writing for the paper in 1914 as a war correspondent from the battlefields of World War I. Bly eventually returned to the United States and was given her own column that she wrote right up until her death in 1922.

Kilgallen also wrote articles that appeared on the same days as her column on different pages, sometimes the front page. Regular Journal-American contributor Jimmy Cannon was one of the highest paid sports columnists in the United States. Society columnist Maury Henry Biddle Paul, who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Cholly Knickerbocker\\", became famous and coined the term \\"Caf√© Society\\". John F.

Ford Frick (1894‚Äì1978) was a sportswriter for the American before becoming president of baseball's National League (1934‚Äì1951), then commissioner of Major League Baseball (1951‚Äì1965).

Bill Corum was a sportswriter for the Journal-American who also served nine years as president of the Churchill Downs race track. Frank Graham covered sports there from 1945‚Äì1965 and was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame, as were colleagues Charley Feeney and Sid Mercer.

Photographs The newspaper was famous for publishing many photographs with the \\"Journal-American Photo\\" credit line as well as news photographs from Associated Press and other wire services. Decline With one of the highest circulations in New York in the 1950s and 1960s, the Journal-American nevertheless had difficulties attracting advertising as its blue-collar reading base turned to television, a situation compounded by the fact that television news was affecting evening newspapers more than their morning counterparts. The domination of television news became evident starting with the four-day period of JFK's assassination, Jack Ruby's shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald and both men's funerals.Kluger, Richard, The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune. New York; Alfred A. Knopf, 1986, p. 696. New York newspapers in general were in dire straits by then, following a devastating newspaper strike in late 1962 and early 1963. Journal-American editors, apparently sensing that psychotherapy and rock music were starting to enter the consciousness of both blue-collar and white-collar New Yorkers, enlisted Dr. Joyce Brothers to write front-page articles in February 1964 analyzing the Beatles. While the Beatles were filming Help! in the Bahamas, columnist Phyllis Battelle interviewed them for articles that ran on the Journal-American front page and in other Hearst papers, including the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, for four consecutive days, from April 25 to 28, 1965. During every visit that the Beatles made to New York in 1964 and 1965, including their appearances at Shea Stadium, various Journal-American columnists and reporters devoted a lot of space to them.This web page, legitimate as a Wikipedia source, displays many New York Journal-American clippings of comments about the Beatles in 1964 and 1965. Throughout 1964 and 1965, Dorothy Kilgallen's Voice of Broadway column, which ran Sunday through Friday, often reported short news items about trendy young rock groups and performers such as The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Dave Clark Five, Mary Wells and Sam Cooke. The newspaper was trying to keep up with the many mid-1960s changes in popular music and its interracial fan bases.edition of Friday afternoon, September 25, 1964 It published enlarged photographs of civil rights demonstrations, Dorothy Kilgallen's skepticism about the Warren Commission report as well as many reporters' stories on the increasing crime rate in New York's five boroughs. Most of the front page of the Sunday edition of January 12, 1964 ran stories that were relevant to the previous day's announcement by U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry that \\"a blue ribbon committee of scientists and doctors,\\" in the words of reporter Jack Pickering, had concluded that cigarette smoking was dangerous. The Journal-Americans feel of the pulse of the changing times of the mid-1960s hid the trouble that was going on behind the scenes at the paper, which was unknown to many New Yorkers until after it had ceased publication. Besides trouble with advertisers, another major factor that led to the Journal-Americans demise was a power struggle between Hearst CEO Richard E. Berlin and two of Hearst's sons, who had trouble carrying on the father's legacy after his 1951 death. William Randolph Hearst, Jr. claimed in 1991 that Berlin, who died in 1986, had suffered from Alzheimer's disease starting in the mid-1960s and that caused him to shut down several Hearst newspapers without just cause.Hearst, Jr. William Randolph and Jack Casserly. The Hearsts: Father and Son. New York: Roberts Rinehart, 1991. Merger The Journal-American ceased publishing in April 1966, officially the victim of a general decline in the revenue of afternoon newspapers. While participating in a lock-out in 1965 after The New York Times and New York Daily News had been struck by a union, the Journal- American agreed it would merge (the following year) with its evening rival, the New York World-Telegram and Sun, and the morning New York Herald-Tribune. According to its publisher, publication of the combined New York World Journal Tribune was delayed for several months after the April 1966 expiration of its three components because of difficulty reaching an agreement with manual laborers who were needed to operate the press. The World Journal Tribune commenced publication on September 12, 1966, but folded eight months later. Archives Other afternoon and evening newspapers that expired following the rise of network news in the 1960s donated their clipping files and many darkroom prints of published photographs to libraries. The Hearst Corporation decided to donate the \\"basic back-copy morgue\\" of the Journal-American, according to a book about Dorothy Kilgallen, plus darkroom prints and negatives, according to other sources, to the University of Texas at Austin.Israel, Lee. Kilgallen. New York: Delacorte Press, 1979. Office memorandums and letters from politicians and other notables were shredded in 1966. The newspaper is preserved on microfilm in New York City, Washington, DC, and Austin, Texas. Interlibrary loans make the microfilm accessible to people who cannot travel to those cities. The Journal-American photo morgue is housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The photographic morgue consists of approximately two million prints and one million negatives created for publication, with the bulk of the collection covering the years from 1937 to the paper's demise in 1966. The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, also at the University of Texas at Austin, has the Journal-American morgue of clippings, numbering approximately nine million.

This social satire placed the director Ephraim Kishon and producer Menahem Golan among the first Israeli filmmakers to achieve international success. It also introduced actor Chaim Topol (Fiddler on the Roof) to audiences worldwide. The protagonist's name, Sallah Shabati, is perhaps a play on the phrase ◊°◊ú◊ô◊ó◊î ◊©◊ë◊ê◊™◊ô, Sli·∏•a she'bati, \\"I apologise for coming\\". In earlier print versions of Kishon's short stories which were revised for the film, the character was known as Saadia Shabtai. Plot The film begins with Sallah Shabati, a Mizrahi Jewish immigrant, arriving in Israel with his family. Upon arrival he is brought to live in a ma'abara, or transit camp. He is given a broken-down, one-room shack in which to live with his family and spends the rest of the movie attempting to make enough money to purchase adequate housing. His money-making schemes are often comical and frequently satirize the political and social stereotypes in Israel of the time.

It is now part of HSBC. The bank was founded as the Birmingham and Midland Bank in Union Street, Birmingham, England in August 1836. It expanded in the Midlands, absorbing many local banks, and merged with the Central Bank of London Ltd. in 1891, becoming the London City and Midland Bank. After a period of nationwide expansion, including the acquisition of many smaller banks, the name Midland Bank Ltd was adopted in 1923. By 1934, it was the largest deposit bank in the world. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but in June 1992, it was taken over by HSBC Holdings plc, who phased out the Midland Bank name by June 1999, in favour of HSBC Bank. On 10 June 2015, HSBC announced that it would be rebranding its branches in the United Kingdom. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint described the Midland brand as \\"odds on favourite\\" for a return to the high street. In September 2015, it was announced that the Midland Bank name would not be revived, and the branch network in the United Kingdom would be branded \\"HSBC UK\\".  History  =Early history= Former Threadneedle Street head office of The City Bank, which became London, City & Midland Bank The Lutyens designed Midland Bank Head Office building, London. The Lutyens designed 100 King Street, Manchester. Midland Bank was founded by Charles Geach, its first manager in Union Street, Birmingham, England, in August 1836. Geach had formerly worked at the Bank of England; he secured the business support and capital backing of leading merchants and manufacturers in Birmingham.HSBC Group in Europe 1967 letter to a customer, informing on the introduction of electronic data processing In the 1830s and 1840s, Midland offered discounted bills of exchange for customers. By the 1850s, the bank's customers included railways, iron founders and engineering concerns, utilities and municipal corporations. Midland acquired Stourbridge Old Bank in 1851 and Nichols, Baker and Crane of Bewdley in 1862. =Acquisitions and development in its first 50 years= From the 1880s, it expanded its customer base by opening new branches and acquiring other banks. In 1891 it acquired the Central Bank of London (which gave Midland a seat in the London Clearing House), in 1898 it bought the City Bank (which provided a London head office) and, in 1914, it acquired the Birmingham Banking Company. By 1918, with deposits of ¬£335 million, it ranked as the largest bank in the world. Edward Hopkinson Holden led the bank at this time first as Managing Director from 1898 to 1908 and then as Chairman and Managing Director from 1908 until his death in 1919. He oversaw more than twenty bank amalgamations between 1891 and 1918, and opened new branches throughout England and Wales. Holden also expanded overseas; it was the first British bank to set up a foreign exchange department and, by 1919, it was acting as London bank to some 650 correspondent banks throughout the world. From 1907, these correspondents included The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. After the First World War, the leading British banks entered an agreement with the government that they would not attempt further amalgamations without Treasury approval. As a result, Midland turned its attention to expanding its branch network, adding new banking services, mechanising its systems (from 1928) and advertising its activities. =Post war recovery and international alliances= Midland responded to the ending of credit restrictions in 1958, by extending its branch network and by introducing a series of innovative services, including personal loans (1958), personal cheque accounts (1958) and cheque cards (1966). In 1958, it acquired Forward Trust, which became a leader in installment finance, leasing and factoring services. In 1967, Midland acquired a share in Montagu Trust, the owner of Samuel Montagu & Co., and thereby became the first British clearing bank to own a London merchant bank. Samuel Montagu, with its own history dating back to 1853, became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1974, and is now part of HSBC's private banking business. Through the acquisition of Samuel Montagu & Co, Midland also gained a majority share in Guyerzeller Bank AG (now HSBC Guyerzeller Bank) in Switzerland. Further diversification followed in 1972, when Midland was the leading member of the consortium that acquired the Thomas Cook travel business. After becoming sole owner in 1977, Midland sold its interest in 1992. In 1974, Midland began to open branches or representative offices in overseas countries and to acquire other international banks. The largest of these was the purchase of a majority share in Crocker National of California, United States: this was not a success and Midland was forced to take full ownership in 1985 so that it could sell it to Wells Fargo the following year. In 1980, Midland acquired a controlling interest in Trinkaus & Burkhardt KGaA, a private bank in Germany with a long history of its own, today HSBC Trinkaus. In 1984, in a bid to grab market share Midland scrapped current account charges. It was so successful that all other banks in the United Kingdom had to quickly follow and offer the same or risk losing their customers. The country has had free banking ever since. =Midland joins the HSBC Group= The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation acquired a 14.9% equity interest in Midland Bank in 1987, and a strong working relationship developed. In October 1989, First Direct was established and was at the forefront of telephone banking, with person to person service available twenty four hours a day, 365 days a year. In June 1992, HSBC Holdings plc acquired full ownership of Midland Bank. At the time, it was one of the largest acquisitions in banking history, and gave HSBC a major foothold in Europe, which it needed to complement its existing business in Asia and the Americas, when it had to move its Hong Kong based headquarters to London on 1 January 1993, accepting primary banking supervision by the Bank of England. Midland Bank was renamed HSBC Bank in June 1999, as part of the adoption of the HSBC brand throughout the Group. The last head office of the Midland Bank, opposite the Bank of England in Poultry and Princes Street, was sold in October 2006 to a tycoon from Russia, with HSBC vacating the banking hall on the ground floor and huge underground deposit vaults in 2007. The ground floor is now used in the Channel 4 game show The Bank Job. The architect John Alfred Gotch designed the building, with assistance from Sir Edwin Lutyens. Built between 1921 and 1939, and symbol of the 1930s pride of the biggest bank in the world, the building is currently (2015) under development as a hotel.Russian tycoon buys former Midland HQ HSBC UK swift code (all offices in the United Kingdom) being MIDLGB22 reflects its past as the Midland Bank.

Advertisements for the bank appeared in the popular computer game Theme Park.

It was directed by Ronny Yu and is a remake of the 1937 film Song at Midnight. The film itself is a loose adaptation of the classic Romeo and Juliet romance where love between two passionate lovers were ultimately doomed when parental opposition was the major obstacle. The main theme of the film was, however, a strong adaptation of Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera. The film's language is entirely in Mandarin. Plot The film is loosely based on real life \\"Phantom Lover\\" Dan Cheung, known as such due to the ghostlike (that is, not real) nature of the women he romances. The film is set in China in the 1940s. Song Dan Ping (Leslie Cheung) was an ambitious theatre actor and owner who built his dream magnificent playhouse from where he entertained and dazzled the theatre-loving populace with his adaptation of classics such as Romeo and Juliet and other tragic love stories. His passionate and devoted performances drew the attention of To Wan-Yin (Jacqueline Wu), the beautiful daughter of a corrupt and despotic official. To Wan-Yin would sneak out of her house with her personal maid in the night to watch Dan Ping's play (he was acting as Romeo in Shakespeare's play--'Romeo and Juliet'). During the patriarchal era, romance between an actor (considered useless and without a bright future) and a rich man's daughter was definitely a taboo (it was an irony that the couple were 're-enacting' Romeo and Juliet in the movie). Hence after each performance, Dan Ping and Wan-Yin would have a rendezvous at the theatre and their love deepened to the extent that they vowed to run away from the city and to get married elsewhere. However, Wan-Yin was betrothed to a man she did not love who was reputed to be cruel and sadistic; this persuaded her to throw caution to the wind and run away from home with Song. It also turned out that Wan-Yin's father arranged the marriage (as was the custom of China at that time) to benefit himself as he sought to become allies with another official of great influence, whose friendship would help to improve his social standing. As fate dictated, the eloping couple was caught before the plan came to fruition and Wan-Yin's maid, who had assisted the eloping couple in their attempt to escape, was brutally beaten until she was crippled. Meanwhile, Wan-Yin was locked up in the house by her father to prevent her from eloping. This did not end the couple's tragic fate. Wan-Yin's fiance had arranged his men to harm Dan Ping. After disfiguring Dan Ping's face with burning acid, they set the theatre ablaze with Dan Ping and many other innocent people in it. After Wan-Yin came to know about the fire and Dan Ping's disappearance, she resigned to fate and married her fiance. On her wedding night, Wan-Yin's husband found out that she was not a virgin (he did not 'see red' on their nuptial night). Wan-Yin was then abused and eventually drove out of the house and was forced to lead a wandering life with her crippled maid. Wan-Yin soon lost all her senses as her longing for Dan Ping drove her crazy. Many years later, a group of performing arts students traveled from Beijing to perform in the city where Song Dan Ping had performed, eager to adapt his exploits and to improvise on his legendary performances. They came to the theatre hall, with its outer foundations still intact but with the internal sections terribly destroyed, and made their temporary quarters there. Many people believed Song to have perished in the fire but he was indeed still living as the students made their home in his theatre. Song, however, was badly scarred in the face and was never to reveal his once-handsome face to the outside world and earned the nickname 'The Phantom lover' by his once-loving audience. His personality was also changed as he was severely depressed and morose after the tragic incidents and had lived the life of a hermit ever since. When the students arrived at the theatre, he was slightly encouraged to reveal himself when one of the more talented students tried unsuccessfully to sing his ultimate love serenade whom he dedicated to Wan-Yin. Song later lashed out at the students' incompetence when he could no longer bear such disparaging performances of his efforts and decided to reveal himself and his scarred face to them. When the officials heard that the students tried to popularise Song in their theatre performances and reenact his glorious days, they came to arrest the students. Little did they know their evil deeds were exposed to the public who came for the performances. One by one, the accomplices to the plot to burn down the theatre were forced to confess in detail, to their crimes. Justice was finally achieved but only as a hollow victory on Song's part. In the closing moments, Song was seen holding his lover's hands. Wan-Yin had since become an invalid, and she had also become blind as a result of her ex-husband shooting her. She recognized Song, but lamented that she could not see him - a blessing for him, since she couldn't see how ugly his face had become. The two lovers finally departed the town in a coach, together at last. An epilogue reveals that Wan- Yin died a year later‚Äîprobably due to the shooting injuries‚Äîand that Song never loved another woman in his lifetime.

He was posthumously awarded the Republic of Korea Medal of Order of Merit for National Foundation in 1962 by the South Korean government. Yun Bong-gil memorials were built in South Korea (Seoul), China (Shanghai) and Japan (Kanazawa). Early life Yun Bong- gil was born in Yesan County in the twilight years of the Korean Empire in June 1908. He attended Deoksan Elementary School and also studied in Ochi Seosuk (a village school that taught Korean and Chinese). As Korea had been made a protectorate within the Japanese empire in 1905, Yun grew up in a troubled country. Local resistance grew considerably with the annexation of Korea in 1910. It culminated in the March 1st Movement in 1919 that was aggressively crushed by the Japanese authorities (hundreds of protesters were massacred by the Japanese police force and army). The brutal repression that followed made many activists flee into China. In 1921, Yun began studying Mathematics. By 1926 Yun had become an independence activist, starting evening classes in his home town to help educate people from rural communities about the issues. At the age of 20, he had organized a reading club and published several pamphlets. Farmers Readers, the textbook written by Yun for rural education In 1928, he had become involved in several rural social movements, which were known as \\"farmers' enlightenment and reading societies\\". Yun wrote a textbook called Farmers Readers. It was used at evening classes to teach literacy to poor young adults who could not attend school in rural areas. He also founded a group called \\"Re-invigoration\\" to promote the revival of farming villages. After successfully organizing a well-attended rural cultural festival in which he performed a sketch entitled \\"The Rabbit and the Fox\\", he came to the to attention of the Tokubetsu K≈çt≈ç Keisatsu, the Japanese Secret police in Korea tasked with investigating people and political groups that might threaten the Empire of Japan. Despite the survelliance, Yun continued his activities and was appointed chairman of a Farmers' Association. Promoted through the Suam Sports Council to improve the health of farmers, he also created rural sports clubs because he believed that rural development and the spirit of national independence could be achieved through having a healthy mind and body. By 1930, after establishing two more rural athletic associations for the nationalist movement, Yun decided to go to China because of the harsher Japanese crackdowns on the independence movement.  China After being briefly arrested and sent to prison, Yun fled to Manchuria. In a letter he left behind he wrote: \\"I will not return home alive with the belief that I must die for my country and do something big\\". In China he met fellow activists Kim Tae-sik and Han Il-jin from the Korean independence movement. Yun headed for Shanghai, judging that he would be able to push for a successful independence movement only if he went directly to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. He travelled alone through Dalian, south of the Liaodong Peninsula, to Qingdao, Shandong Province where he worked at a factory run by Park Jin, a Korean businessman, to save money. In August 1931, he finally arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the home of An Jung-geun in the French quarter. Yun also studied English at the Shanghai English School. He visited Kim Gu (1876-1976), the leader of Korea's government-in-exile pledging to work for the independence of Korea. Hongkew Park Bombing Yun Bong-gil with the pledge he made to the Korean Patriotic Corps pinned to his chest. It reads: \\"I make this oath as a member of Korean Patriotic Association to kill the military leaders of the enemy who are invading Korea in order to redeem the independence and freedom of our country.\\" On 29 April 1932, Yun took a bomb disguised as a water bottle to a celebration arranged by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in honor of Emperor Hirohito's birthday at Hongkew Park, Shanghai (one contemporary news report states Yun threw a hand grenade but they also say he was killed at the scene). The bomb killed the government minister for Japanese residents in Shanghai, , and mortally wounded General Yoshinori Shirakawa, who died of his injuries on 26 May 1932. Among the seriously injured were Lieutenant General Kenkichi Ueda, the commander of the 9th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, and Mamoru Shigemitsu, Japanese Envoy in Shanghai, who both lost a leg, and IJN Admiral Kichisabur≈ç Nomura who lost an eye. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, , was seriously injured in the head and body.

Yun then tried to kill himself by detonating a second bomb disguised in a bento box. It did not explode and he was arrested at the scene. The Illustrated London News reported that: > The Japanese National Anthem was being played, when a youth was seen to step > forward and place a cylinder on the front of the dais and then dart > backwards. A dull explosion immediately followed, but it attracted so little > attention that the music continued playing. [...] others were seen to > collapse wounded and bleeding, while soldiers seized the youth and battered > him. Subsequently, another bomb of the same pattern was found near the dais > unexploded.\\" After being convicted by a Japanese military court in Shanghai on 25 May, he was transferred to Osaka prison on 18 November. He was then moved to Kanazawa, Ishikawa: the headquarters of the IJA's 9th Division. Yun was executed by firing squad on 19 December. His body was buried in Nodayama cemetery in Kanazawa. The then-President of the Chinese Republic, Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang government, praised Yun's actions, stating he was \\"a young Korean patriot who has accomplished something tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers could not do\\". However the future South Korean president, Syngman Rhee, disapproved of the incident and Kim Koo's strategy of assassinations as a means to achieve independence because the Japanese could use such attacks to justify their oppression in Korea. Legacy =Funeral and honours= In May 1946, Korean residents in Japan exhumed Yun's remains from Nodayama cemetery. After being transferred to Seoul, they were given Korean funeral rites and reburied in the Korean National Cemetery. On 1 March 1962, the South Korean government posthumously bestowed on him the Republic of Korea Cordon (the highest honor) of the Order of Merit for National Foundation. On 27 March 1968, Chiang Kai-shek, the president of Republic of China in exile in Taiwan, wrote a prose to applaud Yun's action in the request of Yun's biographer, which was not revealed until 18 Dec 2013. =Memorials= Statue of Yun Bong- gil within Yangjae Citizens' Forest in Seoul. Yun Bong-gil Memorial Hall was built in commemoration of the 55th anniversary of his death. It is located in Yangjae Citizen's Forest, Seocho-gu, Seoul Yangjaedong. Second name of Yangjae Citizen's Forest Station is 'Maeheon' which is named after his pen name. There is also a memorial hall called the Plum Pavilion in Lu Xun Park, Shanghai where the bomb throwing incident happened. In Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan, a monument was built on the site where Yun Bong-gil was buried after being executed by the Imperial Japanese Army. =Modern re-evaluation= Today it is a sensitive issue in South Korea to discuss whether Yun's bombing attack in 1932 would be have been considered as terrorism in the modern context. In 2007, Anders Karlsson, a visiting Swedish scholar from SOAS, University of London, compared Yun Bong-gil and Kim Gu to terrorists in his lecture on Korean history. His terming provoked strong criticism from the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. Prof. Jeong Byeong-jun, interviewed by JoongAng Ilbo, dismissed Karlsson's description as the \\"view of Westerners\\". Later he explained his purpose was to highlight \\"how the implications of the 'terrorism' have changed over the course of the past century\\". In 2013, Tessa Morris-Suzuki, an English historian and professor at Australian National University, concurred with Karlsson's explanation and wrote in her academic article, \\"If we accept the literal dictionary definition of the term terrorists as partisan, member of a resistance organization or guerrilla force using acts of violence then Yoo was self-evidently a terrorist.\\" On the other hand, at the \\"International Research Conference in Memory of the 70th Anniversary of Yun Bong-gil & Lee Bong- chang's Patriotic Acts\\" held on 29 April 2002 in Shanghai, some scholars present pointed out that Yun's patriotic acts have distinct differences from modern day terrorism, which targets civilians. Yun only attacked the Japanese top military and political officials attending the event, and no other civilians were hurt by the bombing. To protect civilians, Yun waited until all the diplomats had left the scene.

It won a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1972 at the 30th Worldcon. The title is derived from the 7th of the \\"Holy Sonnets\\" by English poet John Donne: Plot British adventurer Richard Francis Burton dies on Earth and is revived in mid- air in a vast dark room filled with human bodies, some only half formed. There, he is confronted by men in a flying vehicle who then blast him with a weapon. He next awakes upon the shores of a mysterious river, naked and hairless. All around him are other people in a similar situation. Shortly after they awaken, a nearby structure, nicknamed a \\"grailstone,\\" causes food and other supplies to appear in the \\"grails\\" bound to each individual. Burton quickly attracts a group of companions: the neanderthal Kazzintuitruaabemss (nicknamed Kazz), the science fiction author Peter Jairus Frigate, and Alice Liddell. Among these is the extraterrestrial Monat Grrautut, earlier part of a small group of beings from Tau Ceti who had arrived on Earth in the early 21st century. When one of their number was accidentally killed by humans, their spaceship automatically killed most of the people on Earth. Frigate and others alive at the time confirm Monat's story. Retreating into the nearby woods for safety, Burton's party chew gum provided by their grails, and discover that this gum is a powerful hallucinogen. As days and weeks pass, people's physical wants are provided for by the grails, which eventually produce a set of cloths used for clothing. Rumors reach Burton's region that the river continues seemingly forever. One night, Burton is visited by a mysterious cloaked figure, whom Burton dubs \\"The Mysterious Stranger,\\" who explains that he is one of the beings who has constructed this world and resurrected humanity on its shores, and tells Burton to approach the headwaters of the river. After setting off, Burton's group encounters many adventures; but are enslaved by a riverbank kingdom run by Tullus Hostilius and Hermann G√∂ring, against whom Burton leads a successful revolt. G√∂ring himself is killed by Alice. After the revolt, Burton is part of the nation's ruling council. Later, the protagonists discover a person among them who they conclude is an agent of the beings who created this world. Before the man can be questioned, he dies of no apparent cause. An autopsy reveals a small device planted in the man's brain which apparently allowed him to kill himself at will. Burton is visited by the Mysterious Stranger and is warned that the beings who created this world, to whom the Stranger refers as \\"Ethicals\\", are close to capturing Burton. Desperate to escape, Burton kills himself to be resurrected elsewhere in the river valley, and continues thus to explore it. He often finds himself resurrected near Hermann G√∂ring, who undergoes a moral and religious conversion and joins the pacifist Church of the Second Chance. After many resurrections, Burton finds himself resurrected not in the river but in the Dark Tower at the headwaters, and is interrogated by a council of Ethicals to discover the identity of Burton's \\"Mysterious Stranger\\". After fruitlessly questioning him, the Ethicals inform him that they will return him to the river valley, remembering nothing of themselves, and restore him to his friends; but the Mysterious Stranger prevents them from removing his memory and Burton resolves to continue pursuing the truth about the Ethicals and their intentions for the Riverworld.

A shorter version of the novel was serialized in If magazine as \\"The Felled Star\\" (July and August 1967) and \\"The Fabulous Riverboat\\" (June and August 1971). Overview Departing from the exploits of Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton in the first Riverworld novel, To Your Scattered Bodies Go, The Fabulous Riverboat follows the efforts of Samuel Clemens to find a way to build a riverboat on the metal- poor Riverworld. In the process, he confronts a tenth-century Viking, makes friends with a member of another hominid species and forms an uneasy alliance with King John Lackland. Plot summary Twenty years after humanity was resurrected on Riverworld, Sam Clemens is traveling with the crew of a Viking longboat, captained by Eric Bloodaxe, who is notable for having an axe made of metal. On the metal-poor Riverworld, where even a few ounces of metal is a treasure, this is a rarity. Clemens and Bloodaxe have allied in order to find the source of this metal. Clemens is accompanied on his quest by a gigantic prehistoric hominid whom he has named Joe Miller. Miller, despite being very cordial, and talking with a lisp, is a fearsome warrior because of his size, and protects Clemens from Bloodaxe's crew. Clemens is also motivated in his quest by his desire to be reunited with his terrestrial wife, Livy. Unknown to the others, Clemens had been contacted by a mysterious being whom he named X. X claimed to be a member of the beings who were responsible for resurrection, although he disagreed with their goals. He was aware of Clemens's desire to build a metal riverboat, and assured the author that the metal needed to realise this dream could be found upriver. X manages to send a nickel-iron meteorite crashing into Riverwold, not far from Clemens. Clemens and his crew manage to survive the resulting tidal wave that kills nearly everyone in the vicinity. Sadly, Clemens discovers Livy is one of the dead when her body washes up on deck. She had been in the area but will now be resurrected thousands of miles from him. In the wake of the tidal wave all the survivors in the region are put to sleep by a strange fog, and awake to discover the valley has been restored to a pristine condition. Clemens realizes that the meteor likely contains a source of metal and the crew sets out to look for it. They are soon joined by German aviator Lothar von Richthofen, a World War One ace and brother of the famous Red Baron. Lothar becomes a trusted ally of Clemens and an additional ally against Bloodaxe. When the crew reaches the area where the meteor fell, they find a new group of resurrectees who have formed a nascent kingdom. The crew quickly kill the leaders and assume control of the region for themselves. They begin mining the metal from the meteorite. However, Clemens does not trust Bloodaxe, and has his co-leader assassinated. As more metal is exhumed from the ground the technology level of the area begins to rise, including the reintroduction of firearms. While the meteorite is rich in nickel and iron Clemens needs other materials to manufacture modern conveniences. To get these resources he must trade much of his metal to neighboring kingdoms. Many of these kingdoms eye his own kingdom jealously and Clemens is constantly on guard lest he be invaded and his precious mine taken from him. Of particular concern is a neighboring kingdom led by the English King John Lackland. Eventually King John and another kingdom join forces to invade Clemens's land. However, Clemens makes a deal with King John to unite their lands. John betrays his one-time ally and forms the nation of Parolando with Clemens. As production begins on the boat, Clemens receives a rude shock when his wife arrives in the company of Cyrano de Bergerac. In the intervening years Livy has become Cyrano's lover. When the Frenchman, who is noted as one of the best swordsmen in the world, had heard of a kingdom with metal, he became obsessed with traveling there in order to obtain a proper sword. Despite his discomfort with the situation, Clemens quickly warms to Cyrano, and the Frenchman becomes part of Clemens' inner circle. The protagonists meet a later time American astronaut Firebrass, who claims to have visited the Moon, Mars, Ganymede, and orbited Jupiter. Diplomatic problems continue for Parolando, most notably with nearby \\"Soul City\\", a kingdom founded by a black nationalists. Demanding ever increasing payments for its resources, Soul City eventually attacks Parolando, almost conquering the nation until agents of John Lackland dynamite a dam, sending a wave of water to sweep the invading enemies into the river. Despite such setbacks, Clemens builds his riverboat, a side paddle wheeler which is named the Not for Hire. However, on the day of its christening, King John betrays Clemens and steals the ship. As the boat steams away, Clemens vows to build an even bigger and better boat and to exact revenge on King John. Reception Lester del Rey found the novel to be \\"a major piece of fiction. . . .

It is still an open question () whether or not there are non-trivial smooth homotopy spheres in dimension 4. References * A. Kosinski, Differential Manifolds. Academic Press 1993.

The title is derived from lines in Sir Richard Francis Burton's poem The Kas√Ædah of H√¢j√Æ Abd√ª El- Yezd√Æ: Plot The plot, set 30 years after humanity's resurrection, consists of three distinct plot lines, which come together towards the conclusion. In the first plot line, Richard Burton and his friends continue their journey up river. On their journey they encounter a group of ancient Egyptians who tell them of a mission which their Pharaoh had undertaken to reach the source of the River. Accompanied by the Titanthrop Joe Miller, who they believed to be an avatar of Thoth, they scaled the mountains at the River's headwaters and descended into a polar sea, with a large black tower in the center. On the shores they found a cave with supplies and boat. One of their number died there, bringing the story back to the Valley. Burton also discovers that his group has been infiltrated by traitors. Through hypnosis, the Neanderthal Kaz identifies Monat and Pete Frigate as agents of the alien creators of the Riverworld. When Burton goes to confront them he discovers that they have disappeared. The second plot line deals with the real Peter Jairus Frigate, who is unaware that someone has been impersonating him. One day, a ship docks near his home and Frigate recognizes its captains as two of his childhood heroes, Tom Mix and Jack London. He signs on to the crew, joining the Sufi mystic Nur-ed-Din and the African warrior Umslopogas. For years he travels with them without revealing that he knows Mix and London's identities. When he finally confronts the men, they reveal that they had been recruited by the Mysterious Stranger to find the source of the River. Eventually they come upon the metal rich nation of New Bohemia and Frigate suggests they build a balloon to reach the pole faster. However, soon after launch their balloon is destroyed after an encounter with another airship. In the third plot line, the nation of Parolando, now under the rule of President Milton Firebrass, is building an airship, which will allow them to reach the pole faster than Clemens' steamboat. Cyrano de Bergerac has opted to stay behind to help with the project and proves to be a competent pilot. Training is overseen by new arrival Jill Gulbirra, an Australian dirigible pilot and strident feminist. The airship launches and rapidly makes the journey to the pole, where they discover the sea and the dark tower described by the Egyptians. Firebrass and several others abruptly board a helicopter to fly down to the tower, but it explodes, killing them. Engineer Barry Thorne is jailed after it is discovered that he planted a bomb on the helicopter. The crew discover a doorway on the roof of the tower, but all attempts to enter it are stymied by an invisible force field. Japanese Sufi Piscator is able to make it farther than anyone and disappears into the tower. After he does not return, Jill Gulbirra decides to cut their losses and return home. On the way back, they are persuaded by Clemens to mount an attack on King John's steamship. Cyrano leads the attack, which nearly succeeds in kidnapping John, but the king escapes. In the confusion, Barry Thorne escapes and parachutes from the airship, which explodes behind him. * During the third plot line, it is revealed that Firebrass knew the alien from Arcturus and the death of most of humanity in the year 2003 AD.

It was the only male single-sex secondary school in East Sussex and is now a co- educational Academy spread over two sites after Ark Helenswood Academy merged with Ark William Parker on 1 September 2019. History In 1619 The Rev. William Parker, Rector of All Saints Church, Hastings died, leaving a will which said: :\\"I give unto the Mayor, Jurates and Comynaltye of Hastings and to their successors for ever towards the maynteynance of a Religious and godlie Schoolemaster in the sayd towne w'ch shall instructe and teach the youthe of the Inhabitants of Hastings in learninge, manners and other vertuous education to gette their livinge. To which sayd use I give all my land in the parishe of Oer.\\"From a school prospectus. A shorter version with modernised spelling is given in John Manwaring Baines FSA, Historic Hastings. F J Parsons Ltd, Hastings, 1955 and 1963, Page 275. This is taken as the foundation of the school, although Parker's will also stated that his widow should enjoy the income from all his property until her death, so no money was available to appoint the first master until twenty years later. The will stipulated that the master should be chosen by the jurates (town councillors) living within the parish of All Saints, rather than by the town council as a whole, and by any heir of William Parker still living in Hastings. Parker's nephew William became Mayor of Hastings, and his nephew's son (also William) later became master of the school. Titus Oates, son of the rector of All Saints, Samuel Oates, and later infamous for fabricating the notorious Popish Plot, started his career by bringing false charges against both William Parkers in an attempt to create a vacancy for the post of master. Records of early masters are incomplete, but in 1759 John Shorter was appointed master, once again by another William Parker, mayor elect. In 1708 a Kentish landowner by the name of James Saunders made various charitable legacies in his will, including provisions for a schoolmaster in Rye and a schoolmaster and two school mistresses in Hastings. One of the mistresses was to teach 30 pupils in the parish of All Saints and the other in the parish of St Clements, at a salary of ¬£10 per year. The master was to teach reading, writing, Latin, accounting, mathematics and navigation to any poor child in Hastings \\"from the Seagate next the Fish Market\\", at a salary of ¬£40 per year, subject to a maximum of 70 pupils. Saunders stipulated that the corporation of each of the towns concerned should oversee the way the other operated their school, with the penalty for failing to comply with the terms of the bequest that all the funds should go to the other town. neo-Gothic building: built 1883; demolished 1965‚àí1966 Falling income from the two charities meant that by 1809 one master, Joseph Hannay, was employed to teach forty boys on behalf of the Parker school, and fifteen for the Saunders school. The Saunders fund continued to pay two schoolmistresses ten pounds each per year, while the master received three pounds per child. Local complaints about the low rents being charged by the corporation for the Parker fund lands had led to increases from ¬£49 in 1787 to ¬£134 in 1809, but the council also turned down an offer from one James Halloway to rent the estate for ¬£205. Thomas Breeds, another prominent local man, applied to the High Court of Chancery arguing that the funds were being improperly administered, with the result that he himself rented them for ¬£210, no higher bid being received at a public auction. The expenses of the case were paid by the funds, with the result that the Saunders school had to close for five years, but afterwards two separate masters were appointed. The two were permanently re-merged in 1878, together with part of the Magdalen trust, to form the Hastings Grammar School Foundation. A Victorian Gothic Revival building was constructed by John Howell & Son to the design of Jeffery & Skiller on a slope overlooking Hastings, at Standen's High Field which became Nelson road, and occupied in July 1883. The school was originally designed as a central tower with wings either side. Owing to lack of funds, the wing intended as accommodation for the headmaster and boarders was never built. =Modern educational reforms= Following the Education Act of 1902, the school began to receive a grant from the British Government. Under the Education Act of 1944, secondary schools in England were reorganised in three categories: grammar schools, technical schools, and secondary modern schools. The school was naturally classed as a grammar school under this scheme, and had voluntary aided status: in other words the income from the Foundation was supplemented by a grant from the Local Education Authority. From now on, admission to the school was solely via the eleven-plus examination, and education was free (previously there had been fees of five guineas a year). Classes were held six days a week, with no lessons on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. Saturday morning school was abolished in 1967. =Voluntary controlled status= In 1959 the school governors decided to change the status of the school from voluntary aided to voluntary controlled. The school was now controlled by a board of ten governors appointed by the borough of Hastings and five appointed by the charitable foundation. The charitable funds remained under the control of the foundation governors, but responsibility for providing buildings now fell to the education authority. A new modern building was constructed further from the town centre, on of land which had long been used as the school's playing fields. The new school was designed for 570 boys, including a sixth form of 120, and is now the Parkstone Road half of the school. The foundation stone of the new school was laid on 4 July 1962, and the school occupied in 1964. =Comprehensive school= The incoming Labour government of 1965 introduced a change in national education policy intended to phase out grammar school education and replace it with comprehensive education. This was resisted by the borough of Hastings, but local government reorganisation under the following Conservative administration meant that the autonomous county borough was abolished and replaced by East Sussex County Council as the education authority. A decision was taken to change to a comprehensive school intake, and at the same time to merge the school with Hastings Secondary School. A further new building was constructed on the same site, but reached by a separate road entrance in Park Avenue. The school was renamed \\"the William Parker School\\" and had its first comprehensive system intake in 1978. This first year of comprehensive students were temporarily taught in Priory Road School, with occasional lessons at the old Grammar School while the new building was being completed, and moved across to the new location for 1979 start of school year. =College= In 1998, the school achieved specialist Sports College status, following the new opening of an athletics arena. Towards 2000 the Alan Booth Jones Cricket centre opened, which featured indoor cricket and other sports facilities used both by the school and externally. In 2006, the school re-instated the roles of Head Boy, Deputy Head Boy and Prefects for the Year 7-11 year group. They were chosen from Year 11 and distinguished from the rest of the year group by their tie, which wasdark blue with the school crest. In 2013, William Parker Sports College was graded Inadequate by Ofsted and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Care and Skills placed the college into Special Measures. As a result, the Secretary of State issued an academy order in accordance with Section 44 of the Education Act 2005. =Academy= In 2013, the governing body applied with Ark to become an academy. On 1 September 2013, ARK William Parker opened, replacing William Parker Sports College, with a capacity of 1400 including a sixth form of 200 places. The school shared a sixth form with Ark Helenswood which at its latest inspection was graded Good and shares the highest results, for progress, in East Sussex. After becoming an Ark academy, the school received two Section 5 Ofsted inspections each grading the school Requires Improvement and despite encouraging signs of improvement, it was plagued by a falling roll, budget deficits and high staff turnover. From its inception as an academy in 2013 to its merger in 2019, the academy had been led by four Principals. Mr Daniel Hatley served as the second principal of Ark William Parker, however, he had been appointed as the principal by East Sussex County Council of William Parker Sports College prior to the school's conversion into a Sponsored Academy. He later became the Associate Principal and, finally, the Principal again of Ark WIlliam Parker. In 2017, Ofsted praised the 'School leaders, governors and members of the academy trust' for 'focusing on the right things' leading to 'already encouraging signs of improvement.' However, the academy still maintained its Requires Improvement judgement. While the final results of Ark William Parker moved in line with the national average (2018-19), the school had continually performed below the government's floor standards. Attendance, however, had improved by 2018 to the joint highest in East Sussex. In 2018-19, Ark William Parker achieved the second highest results in Hastings with an average Progress 8 score finishing above the largest academies in Hastings, The St Leonards Academy and The Hastings Academy. = Ark Alexandra = After continual budget deficits, Ark took the contentious decision to bring Ark Helenswood and Ark William Parker together as one school on two sites. The Helenswood campus would house KS3, years 7-8 and the William Parker campus years 9-13 which includes the sixth form. The Minister approved this proposed merger on 19 December 2018 and on 1 September 2019, Ark Helenswood closed and merged with Ark William Parker. Ark Alexandra assumed the legal identity of Ark William Parker with an expanded co-educational capacity of 2100 students across two sites and it opened on 1 September 2019. The Principal and Executive Principal of Ark William Parker assumed their same roles at Ark Alexandra Academy and they are assisted by an Associate Regional Principal and a Regional Director. In January 2020, the Principal, Stephanie Newman, announced she was stepping back. She was appointed in 2017 as the Acting Principal which makes her the longest serving Principal of Ark William Parker. Campus After Ark Helenswood merged into Ark William Parker to become Ark Alexandra, the academy now educates students across two sites: the Helenswood (Lower) Campus and the William Parker (Upper) Campus. Below are the details of the William Parker Campus: =Upper Block= * Art * Science * History *English *French * Food Technology * Cricket Pavilion and Sports field. =Middle Block= The middle block is the newest classroom building on the site and it houses the library and two IT classrooms. * Library * Geography * Spanish *Politics =Lower Block= The lower block is a 1/2 storey building with a 'bare-brick' style. The classrooms here are: Mathematics, DT, Graphics, ICT, Business, Economics, Politics, Drama, PE and SEN (Special Educational Needs). Also on the Lower School grounds is a Sports Centre, Engineers Garage and Athletics Track. The lessons taught in the Lower block are: * Business and Economics * Mathematics * Design Technology * Graphics * Literacy * RE * ICT * History * PE * PSHE * ISEND * Music =Other Facilities= William Parker School, Parkstone road building * 465 Computers for student use * Drama studio * Nine science laboratories * Three Art and design suites * Fully equipped graphics studio capable of working with up to 28 students * Open-plan Resource and Library Centre * Air- conditioned classrooms * New Sports Centre * Old Sports Hall * Classrooms equipped with interactive whiteboards * ABJ indoor cricket school (built in commemoration of Alan Booth Jones) * Dance Studio * Small theatre * Train 2 Learn Centre * William Parker Community Athletics Arena Sports, clubs, and traditions William Parker community athletics arena = William Parker = Apart from football and cricket, many other sports are played like Rugby, Badminton and Basketball. William Parker was divided into three houses for sporting events and for students to wear during PE lessons. * Parker (yellow) * Saunders (green) * Saxon (red) The house system was incorporated into the pastoral system for 2017-18 and 2018-19, and as a result, there were three Heads of Houses with responsibility for charity fundraising and house events as well as, the behaviour, attendance and tutor activities of students in their house. = Ark Alexandra Academy = Ark Alexandra maintains William Parker's Church of England distinctiveness and aims to preserve and build on the legacy of both William Parker and Helenswood. It has five houses including two from William Parker, however, the house system has yet to be embedded into the academy fully. The school has three values: Faith, Excellence and Kindness. Uniform There are currently three uniforms that are worn at Ark Alexandra Academy including at the William Parker campus. For Year 7s, the new Ark Alexandra Academy uniform is cumpolsory, however, for the other years, excluding the sixth form, they are free to wear either their old Ark Helenswood/Ark William Parker uniform or buy and wear the new uniform. The various uniforms are as follows: * Blazer with William Parker/Helenswood/Alexandra badge * Plain white shirt * Tie (Alexandra- blue and gold/ William Parker- red and green/red/yellow) * Trousers (Navy- Ark Alexandra/Black- Ark William Parker/Helenswood) *Skirt (Helenswood) * Black shoes * Jumper with logo, optional Notable former pupils =Hastings Grammar School= * Archibald Belaney (1888‚Äì1938), who emigrated to Canada, claimed to be half-Apache, and wrote a number of books under the name of Grey OwlGrey Owl's Hastings 1066.net. * Timothy Booth Jones (born 1952), Sussex cricketer * Sir Herbert Butcher, National Liberal MP for Holland with Boston from 1937‚Äì1966 * Edwin Constable, Professor of Chemistry, University of Basel, 1966‚Äì1972 * Michael Jabez Foster, Labour MP for Hastings and Rye from 1997‚Äì2010 * Simon Fuller, Manager of The Spice Girls and David Beckham; creator of \\"Pop Idol\\" * Simon Kirby, Conservative MP for Brighton Kemptown from 2010‚Äì2017 * Alan Oakman, England and Sussex cricketer.

It is often used in analyzing data from spectroscopy or diffraction. Definition Without loss of generality, we can consider only centered profiles, which peak at zero. The Voigt profile is then : V(x;sigma,gamma) equiv int_{-infty}^infty G(x';sigma)L(x-x';gamma), dx', where x is the shift from the line center, G(x;sigma) is the centered Gaussian profile: : G(x;sigma) equiv frac{e^{-x^2/(2sigma^2)}}{sigma sqrt{2pi}}, and L(x;gamma) is the centered Lorentzian profile: : L(x;gamma) equiv frac{gamma}{pi(x^2+gamma^2)}. The defining integral can be evaluated as: : V(x;sigma,gamma)=frac{operatorname{Re}[w(z)]}{sigmasqrt{2 pi}}, where Re[w(z)] is the real part of the Faddeeva function evaluated for : z=frac{x+igamma}{sigmasqrt{2}}. In the limiting cases of sigma=0 and gamma =0 then V(x;sigma,gamma) simplifies to L(x;gamma) and G(x;sigma), respectively. History and applications In spectroscopy, a Voigt profile results from the convolution of two broadening mechanisms, one of which alone would produce a Gaussian profile (usually, as a result of the Doppler broadening), and the other would produce a Lorentzian profile. Voigt profiles are common in many branches of spectroscopy and diffraction. Due to the expense of computing the Faddeeva function, the Voigt profile is often approximated using a pseudo-Voigt profile. Properties The Voigt profile is normalized: : int_{-infty}^infty V(x;sigma,gamma),dx = 1, since it is a convolution of normalized profiles. The Lorentzian profile has no moments (other than the zeroth), and so the moment-generating function for the Cauchy distribution is not defined. It follows that the Voigt profile will not have a moment-generating function either, but the characteristic function for the Cauchy distribution is well defined, as is the characteristic function for the normal distribution. The characteristic function for the (centered) Voigt profile will then be the product of the two: : varphi_f(t;sigma,gamma) = E(e^{ixt}) = e^{-sigma^2t^2/2 - gamma t}. Since normal distributions and Cauchy distributions are stable distributions, they are each closed under convolution (up to change of scale), and it follows that the Voigt distributions are also closed under convolution. = Cumulative distribution function = Using the above definition for z , the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be found as follows: :F(x_0;mu,sigma) =int_{-infty}^{x_0} frac{operatorname{Re}(w(z))}{sigmasqrt{2pi}},dx =operatorname{Re}left(frac{1}{sqrt{pi}}int_{z(-infty)}^{z(x_0)} w(z),dzright). Substituting the definition of the Faddeeva function (scaled complex error function) yields for the indefinite integral: : frac{1}{sqrt{pi}}int w(z),dz =frac{1}{sqrt{pi}} int e^{-z^2}left[1-operatorname{erf}(-iz)right],dz, which may be solved to yield : frac{1}{sqrt{pi}}int w(z),dz = frac{operatorname{erf}(z)}{2} +frac{iz^2}{pi},_2F_2left(1,1;frac{3}{2},2;-z^2right), where {}_2F_2 is a hypergeometric function. In order for the function to approach zero as x approaches negative infinity (as the CDF must do), an integration constant of 1/2 must be added. This gives for the CDF of Voigt: :F(x;mu,sigma)=operatorname{Re}left[frac{1}{2}+ frac{operatorname{erf}(z)}{2} +frac{iz^2}{pi},_2F_2left(1,1;frac{3}{2},2;-z^2right)right]. = The uncentered Voigt profile = If the Gaussian profile is centered at mu_G and the Lorentzian profile is centered at mu_L, the convolution is centered at mu_G+mu_L and the characteristic function is : varphi_f(t;sigma,gamma,mu_mathrm{G},mu_mathrm{L})= e^{i(mu_mathrm{G}+mu_mathrm{L})t-sigma^2t^2/2 - gamma t}. The mode and median are both located at mu_G+mu_L. = Derivative profile = The first and second derivative profiles can be expressed in terms of the Faddeeva function as follows: : frac{partial}{partial x} V(x;sigma,gamma)= -frac{operatorname{Re}[z ~w(z)]}{sigma^2sqrt{pi}} = -frac{x}{sigma^2} frac{operatorname{Re}[w(z)]}{sigmasqrt{2 pi}}+frac{gamma}{sigma^2} frac{operatorname{Im}[w(z)]}{sigmasqrt{2 pi}}; : frac{partial^2}{partial x^2} V(x;sigma,gamma) = frac{x^2-gamma^2-sigma^2}{sigma^4} frac{operatorname{Re}[w(z)]}{sigmasqrt{2 pi}} -frac{2 x gamma}{sigma^4} frac{operatorname{Im}[w(z)]}{sigmasqrt{2 pi}} +frac{gamma}{sigma^4}frac{1}{pi}, using the above definition for z. Voigt functions The Voigt functions U, V, and H (sometimes called the line broadening function) are defined by :U(x,t)+iV(x,t) = sqrt frac{pi}{4t} e^{z^2} operatorname{erfc}(z) = sqrt frac{pi}{4t} w(iz), :H(a,u) = frac{U(u/a,1/4 a^2)}{asqrt pi}, where :z=(1-ix)/2sqrt t, erfc is the complementary error function, and w(z) is the Faddeeva function. = Relation to Voigt profile = : V(x;sigma,gamma) = H(a,u) / (sqrt 2 sqrt pi sigma), with : a = gamma / (sqrt 2 sigma) and : u = x / (sqrt 2 sigma).  Numeric approximations  = Pseudo-Voigt approximation = The pseudo-Voigt profile (or pseudo-Voigt function) is an approximation of the Voigt profile V(x) using a linear combination of a Gaussian curve G(x) and a Lorentzian curve L(x) instead of their convolution. The pseudo-Voigt function is often used for calculations of experimental spectral line shapes. The mathematical definition of the normalized pseudo-Voigt profile is given by : V_p(x,f) = eta cdot L(x,f) + (1 - eta) cdot G(x,f) with 0 < eta < 1 . eta is a function of full width at half maximum (FWHM) parameter. There are several possible choices for the eta parameter. A simple formula, accurate to 1%, is : eta = 1.36603 (f_L/f) - 0.47719 (f_L/f)^2 + 0.11116(f_L/f)^3, where now, eta is a function of Lorentz ( f_L ), Gaussian ( f_G ) and total ( f ) Full width at half maximum (FWHM) parameters. The total FWHM ( f ) parameter is described by: : f = [f_G^5 + 2.69269 f_G^4 f_L + 2.42843 f_G^3 f_L^2 + 4.47163 f_G^2 f_L^3 + 0.07842 f_G f_L^4 + f_L^5]^{1/5}. = The width of the Voigt profile = The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Voigt profile can be found from the widths of the associated Gaussian and Lorentzian widths. The FWHM of the Gaussian profile is :f_mathrm{G}=2sigmasqrt{2ln(2)}. The FWHM of the Lorentzian profile is :f_mathrm{L}=2gamma. A rough approximation for the relation between the widths of the Voigt, Gaussian, and Lorentzian profiles is: :f_mathrm{V}approx f_mathrm{L}/2+sqrt{f_mathrm{L}^2/4+f_mathrm{G}^2}. This approximation is exactly correct for a pure Gaussian. A better approximation with an accuracy of 0.02% is given by :f_mathrm{V}approx 0.5346 f_mathrm{L}+sqrt{0.2166f_mathrm{L}^2+f_mathrm{G}^2}. This approximation is exactly correct for a pure Gaussian, but has an error of about 0.000305% for a pure Lorentzian profile.

(), formerly Liann Yee Production Co., Ltd. (), is a Taiwanese commercial television broadcasting company. It was originally established as a joint venture between TVB in Hong Kong and Era Group in Taiwan, but TVB took over Era's shares in the company in 2005. Later, TVB sold all of its shares in the company to other Taiwanese companies. As of 2019, TVBS operates four domestic channels and one international channel: TVBS, the flagship channel; TVBS News, 24-hour news channel; TVBS Entertainment, which shows variety and drama series; TVBS E! (formerly TVB8), an alternative channel available on CHT MOD IPTV platform; and TVBS Asia, available outside Taiwan. History The company's flagship channel, TVBS, began its broadcast through satellite DTH and local cable systems on 28 September 1993. The name originally stood for \\"TVB Superchannel\\", while its Chinese name was Wuhsien Weihsing Tienshiht'ai (). It was originally a part of the so-called \\"Gang of Five\\", which was a consortium that was set up to compete against Star TV across Asia. (The others in the group were CNN International, HBO, ESPN International [with its Asian operations] and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation [with Australia Television International]) The consortium's channels were initially transmitted via Palapa satellite, but were later also added to Apstar satellite. TVBS later launched an international version named TVBS Asia in 1997, and TVB launched separate satellite channels that targeted East and Southeast Asia in 1998. As the first privately owned broadcaster, it broke the decades-long oligopoly of the three state-owned terrestrial television stations in the Taiwan market. TVBS Media was the first Taiwanese broadcasting company to go full HD, from filming to production to broadcast.

Normally applied to metal, it can also be used on glass, plastic and other materials. A photoresist is selected which is resistant to the particular acid or other etching compound to be used. It may be a liquid applied by brushing, spraying, pouring or other means and then allowed to set, or it may come in sheet form and be applied by laminating. It is then exposed to light‚Äîusually strong ultraviolet (UV) light‚Äîthrough a photographic, mechanically printed, or manually created image or pattern on transparent film. Alternatively, a lens may be used to project an image directly onto it. Typically, the photoresist is hardened where it receives sufficient exposure to light, but some photoresists are initially hard and are then softened by exposure. A solvent is used to wash away the soft parts, laying bare the underlying material, which is then bathed in or sprayed with the acid or other etchant. The remaining photoresist is usually removed after the operation is complete. In the graphic arts, photoengraving is used to make printing plates for various printing processes, reproducing a wide variety of graphics such as lettering, line drawings and photographs. The same procedure is used to make printed circuit boards, foil-stamping dies and embossing dies. It is also used to make nameplates, commemorative plaques and other decorative engravings. It can be used to make flat springs, levers, gears and other practical components that would otherwise be fabricated from sheet metal by cutting, drilling, jigsawing or stamping. A very high degree of precision is possible. In these applications, it is properly called photochemical machining, but the terms photochemical milling, chemical milling and photoetching are sometimes used. A similar process called photolithography is used to make integrated circuits. Methods One method of photoengraving produces a shallow depression in the metal. This is used for intaglio printing plates or for decorative purposes. It is also the same method used for printed circuit boards. The engraving is usually made in copper or brass. The process can be done in open trays but is much more effective if the etchant (often ferric chloride) is sprayed onto the metal. When ferric chloride is used as the etchant, no metal parts other than titanium can be used in the etching equipment. Decorative engraving is often filled by spray-painting then sanding to remove the paint from the raised parts of the engraving. Another method produces a deep engraving with sloped shoulders. In this method, the metal (usually zinc or magnesium) is held face down and a mixture of nitric acid and a soap-like oil is splashed onto it. As the acid etches the surface, the oil adheres to the edges of the exposed area. This progressively reduces the area being etched, resulting in a sloped edge; a single dot will end up as a cone- shaped mound protruding from the etched area. This method is used for printing plates (the shoulder supports the printing surface), foil stamping dies and embossing dies. Decorative engravings made by this method may go through a second process to produce a decorative background. The raised parts and their shoulders are painted with an etchant-resistant material and a pattern of etchant-resistant material is applied to the deep parts of the engraving. The resist for the background may be another photoengraving or may be randomly splashed on. The engraving is etched again for a short time to produce a raised pattern in the background. Decorative engravings of this type may also be spray-painted and sanded as in the previous method. In traditional print shop practice, a special very-large-format camera is used to image the source material either directly onto the photosensitive coating, or onto a sheet of photographic film which is then developed and contact-printed onto the coated plate. In large-scale commercial printing, computer-driven optoelectronic equivalents began to replace these methods in the 1970s. In the case of line cuts (graphics in solid blacks and whites without gradations of gray or color), the photoengraving is done on zinc, and the result is called a zinc etching. In the case of halftone cuts, the work is done on copper. The halftone effect is accomplished by photographing the subject through a wire or glass screen, which breaks the image up into a pattern of dots with sizes corresponding to the local brightness of the image; the larger dots create the darker areas, the smaller dots the highlights. The finer the screen, the finer the detail possible in the printed product. Halftones made with a screen having 65 lines to the inch are considered coarse. Those having 150 lines to the inch are considered fine. History The oldest known print made from a photoengraved plate, by Nic√©phore Ni√©pce in 1825. It reproduces a 17th-century Flemish engraving. Ni√©pce called the process \\"Heliography\\". The first photoengraving process was developed in the 1820s by Nic√©phore Ni√©pce, which used photoresist to make a one-off camera photograph rather than a printing plate. His usual test subjects were paper prints of conventional engravings, and exposure was by contact under direct sunlight rather than by the use of a camera. Several metals were tried for the printing plate, as well as glass and lithographic stone. His first success came in 1822. The earliest known surviving example of a paper print made from one of his photoengraved plates dates to 1825 and reproduces a 17th-century engraving. Ni√©pce used Bitumen of Judea as the photoresist. Initially soluble in various spirits and oils, a thin coating of bitumen hardens (polymerizes) where it is exposed to light. The unexposed parts can then be rinsed away with a solvent, baring the underlying material, which can then be etched to the desired depth. Ni√©pce's process lay dormant for many years, but it was revived in the 1850s and bitumen was widely used as a photoresist far into the 20th century. Very long exposures in bright light were required, but bitumen had the advantage that it was superbly resistant to strong acids.Niepce House Museum history pages. Retrieved 28 May 2013. The use of photoengraving for a halftone process that could be used to print grayscale photographic images dates all the way back to the 1839 introduction of the daguerreotype, the first practical photographic process. The daguerreotype image consisted of a microscopically fine granular structure on the surface of a silver-plated copper sheet that had been polished to a mirror finish. Methods were soon devised for differentially etching the image grains and the ground so that the daguerreotype could be used as a printing plate. In some instances, very pleasing results were obtained, but exceptional skill and care were required and the very fine structure of the image limited the useful life of each plate to a few hundred prints at best. Henry Fox Talbot is usually credited with the first workable process for converting a grayscale image into a varying structure of stark black and white that resulted in a reasonably durable printing plate. As with other early halftone processes, the plate could not be combined with ordinary type, so for inclusion in a book or periodical each image had to be printed separately and either bound in or tipped in with an adhesive. Frederic E. Ives is usually credited with the first commercially successful process that was compatible with ordinary letterpress printing, so that halftone blocks could be printed along with blocks of text in books, periodicals and newspapers. His process came into widespread use during the 1890s, largely replacing the hand- engraved wood and metal blocks that had previously served to provide illustrations. As in many other fields of invention, there are conflicting claims of priority, instances of simultaneous invention, and variously nuanced definitions of the terminology, so sorting out the merits of the \\"first\\" claims made on behalf of the many inventors in the field of halftone reproduction‚Äînot infrequently biased by nationalistic sentiments‚Äîcan be very problematic.

It was released in the United States on September 22, 1992. The story deals with a group of time-travelling white supremacist members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) from an imagined 21st-century South Africa, who supply Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia with AK-47s and other advanced technology, medicine and intelligence. Their intervention results in a Confederate victory in the war. Afterwards, however, the AWB members discover that their ideas for the Confederate States and Lee's are not one and the same as they believed and the general and the men of the South have a violent falling out with the white supremacists from the future.  Plot  = Alteration of the Civil War = In January 1864, the Confederate States is on the verge of losing the Civil War against the United States. Men with strange accents and oddly-mottled clothing approach Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the headquarters of the Army of Northern Virginia. They demonstrate a rifle far superior to all other firearms of the time, operating on chemical and engineering principles that are unknown to Confederate military engineers. They offer to supply the Confederate Army with the rifles, which they refer to as AK-47s. The men, who call their organization \\"America Will Break\\" (or \\"AWB\\"), establish a base in Rivington in Nash County, North Carolina, along with offices in the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. The AWB continues to offer inexplicable intelligence and technology to the Confederacy, including nitroglycerine tablets for treating Lee's heart condition. Finally, Lee questions their leader, Andries Rhoodie, who provides Lee a partially true explanation. The men of AWB are Afrikaner Neo-Nazi ultra- nationalists from post-apartheid South Africa, having traveled back 150 years from the year 2014 to change the outcome of the Civil War. The newcomers claim that white supremacy has not endured to the modern era and that blacks have marginalized whites. Lee is told that President Abraham Lincoln will act as a vicious tyrant during his second term and that his successor, Thaddeus Stevens, will continue his work to ensure that blacks will become the dominant political faction in the former Confederacy, as they outnumber whites in many areas. The AWB says that blacks will take over other countries, including the United Kingdom. The AWB men train soldiers to use their new weapons and issue ammunition. With the AWB's guns and some direct military aid from the time- traveling Afrikaners, the Army of Northern Virginia drives Union General Ulysses S. Grant's forces out of Virginia. In a surprise night attack they capture Washington City, thus ending the Civil War. Lincoln refuses to flee the capital during their advance and appears on the White House lawn, where he addresses them before personally surrendering to Lee. The United Kingdom and France recognize the Confederacy, and Lincoln is forced to accept the Confederate victory. = Events after Confederate victory = The results of the 1864 United States presidential election in the novel. The blue states are those won by Seymour/Vallandigham, the red states won by Lincoln/Hamlin, light gray states won by McClellan/Everett, yellow states won by Fremont/Johnson while dark gray represents the US territories After Lincoln loses the subsequent United States election, the Union reluctantly agrees to pay $90 million in gold (more than $1.4 billion in 2019) as reparations; the Confederacy, in turn, gives up any claim to Maryland and West Virginia. Kentucky ultimately votes to join the Confederacy and Missouri to remain in the Union. Many Confederate slaves freed by the Union during the war who served in the Union Army continue to fight Confederate forces long after the Union formally surrenders. That frightens many Confederate whites and infuriates the troops charged with fighting them, particularly Nathan Bedford Forrest and his men. Lee, already dubious about slavery and respectful of the courage of the United States Colored Troops during the war, becomes convinced that continuing to enslave blacks is both morally wrong and ultimately impracticable. Despite threats from Rhoodie and the AWB, Lee makes no effort to hide his views. The results of the 1867 Confederate States presidential election in the novel. The Red denotes states won by Lee/Brown, blue denotes those won by Forrest/Wigfall while dark gray represents the Indian Territory At the urging and with the full backing of Jefferson Davis, who may not be re- elected under the Constitution of the Confederate States after his six-year term, Lee runs for President in the 1867 Confederate States presidential election, on a pro-abolition Confederate Party ticket with Senator Albert Gallatin Brown of Mississippi as his running mate. The Rivington men back the pro-slavery Patriot Party ticket of General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Senator Louis Wigfall of Texas, putting their considerable resources into Forrest's campaign. Lee achieves a narrow victory, defeating Forrest 69-50 in the Electoral College and by 32,000 popular votes out of 963,437 cast. Following his loss, Forrest concedes defeat. = AWB's betrayal = Soon after the election, Lee receives a history book that was stolen from the Rivington men from a former Confederate soldier, which covers the Civil War and the original outcome that was supposed to happen without the AWB's intervention. Enraged at the lies that Rhoodie had told him about the future, Lee confronts the AWB leader by using the modern history book as proof of Rhoodie's dishonesty, and compares his fanaticism to that of John Brown. Faced with the accusations, Rhoodie promises to show the AWB's true colors to Lee. At Lee's inauguration on March 4, 1868, AWB men try to assassinate him by using Uzis, which results in the death of Lee's wife, Mary, Vice President Brown, various dignitaries and generals, and many civilians. Police forces seize the AWB offices in Richmond after a fierce battle. Lee enters the stronghold to find more technological marvels (such as fluorescent light bulbs and air conditioning), books that document the increasing marginalization of racism from 1865 into the 21st century, and the efforts made to improve race relations. Lee shows the books to the Confederate Congress, in the hope that the future's nearly- universal condemnation of slavery and racism will convince them to vote for his plan for gradual abolition. Confederate forces lay siege to Rivington and engage the AWB, which uses modern weaponry such as belt-fed machine guns, sniper rifles, mortars, barbed wire, and land mines to inflict heavy casualties on the Confederate forces. Ultimately, Confederate infantry destroy the AWB's time machine during the fighting and seize the town after they break through the AWB defenses. Those surviving AWB men who were unable to escape back to their own time lose hope and surrender. In Richmond, the Confederate Congress narrowly passes President Lee's gradual emancipation bill. Pharmacists have copied the nitroglycerin pills brought by the AWB, and Lee hopes, with their help, to live to see the effects of his plan for emancipation. Several of the stranded Afrikaners agree to help the Confederacy replicate their 21st-century technology so that Lee can counter the Union in both its replica AK-47s and its greater industrial strength. Though the Confederacy has maintained strict neutrality in a war that the Union had started with the British Empire by invading Canada, Lee fears that the Union may later attempt a war of revenge against the Confederacy. He rests assured that the Confederacy will, however, remain the most technologically advanced country in the world for many decades to come.

Known at the time as the Concrete Highway, the freeway was initially opened in 1975 as a route to avoid the city centre of Johannesburg and access for the western areas of the Witwatersrand. From the south, the Western Bypass begins at the Diepkloof Interchange in Soweto, where it splits from the N12 freeway and ends at the Buccleuch Interchange, where it merges with the N3 Eastern Bypass, M1 South and N1 Ben Schoeman freeways. The Western Bypass is the longest section of the Johannesburg Ring Road. The freeway is mostly four lanes wide in either direction, but fans out into six lanes between Rivonia and Buccleuch, where there is heavy traffic moving north towards Pretoria. The Western Bypass is part of the N1 road that spans the length of South Africa, which is the beginning of the famed Cape to Cairo Road. Route The N1 Western Bypass shaded in red The southern terminus of the N1 Western Bypass begins at Diepkloof Interchange where the co-signed N12 splits off and heads east, close to the M68 Chris Hani Road overpass, as the N12 Southern Bypass. At the same interchange, the N1 meets the M12 Rand Show Road (southbound only). The Western Bypass continues north, with the suburb of Diepkloof to the west, to intersect with the M70 Soweto Highway that connects Soweto to the Johannesburg CBD (northerly off-ramp & southerly on-ramp). Continuing north, near Riverlea, it intersects with a road that is part of the proposed extension of the N17 (northerly on-ramp and southerly off-ramp). It soon crosses under the R41 near Wisbey Dip heading north-west past the Newclare Cemetery. It then intersects the R24 Albertina Sisulu Road Interchange in Bosmont. Continuing in a roughly northerly direction it passes under the M18 Ontdekkers Road before interchanging Gordon Road in Florida Glen. Heading north-west, it intersects with the M8 14th Avenue Interchange at Quellerina. Turning north-east it passes between the suburbs of Weltevredenpark and Fairland. Here it intersects the M5 Beyers Naud√© Drive Interchange near Randpark Ridge. Continuing north- east it crosses under the M6 Ysterhout Drive in Bromhof. Continuing northwards, it intersects the R512 Malibongwe Drive Interchange in Strijdompark. The N1 continues north-east through the northern suburbs of Meadowhurst, Olivedale and Douglasdale before intersects the R511/M81 William Nicol Drive, Bryanston. Now taking an easterly direction it passes under the M71 Main Road, Bryanston, then runs parallel with R564 Witkoppen Road to its north until it intersects with the M9 Rivonia Road Interchange in Woodmead. Here, it becomes 6 lanes in each direction. Continuing east it passes under the M85 Bowling Avenue and then under the R55 Woodmead Drive where it reaches the Buccleuch Interchange. At this interchange, it has its eastern terminus, meeting the M1 Highway South to Johannesburg, N3 Eastern Bypass to the East Rand and the N1 Ben Schoeman Freeway to Midrand and Pretoria in the north. Improvements By creating a narrower emergency shoulder, the freeway was widened during the 1990s from two lanes to three lanes in either direction, to alleviate massive traffic congestion on Johannesburg's roads. From 2007, the Western Bypass was included in the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP), which will improve traffic conditions in the province and create jobs in construction. Three of the benefits for users of the bypass will include lighting for the full length of the bypass, increased lanes in most parts of the bypass and increased capacity at the northern interchanges with the bypass. The trade-off for this will be a toll project, aimed at the entire national road network in Johannesburg. Very noticeably, the road is no longer concrete in construction, but has been tarred for its entire length. This spells a death-knell for its Concrete Highway nickname. As with the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project the R511 William Nicol Drive and the M9/R556 Rivonia Road/Witkoppen Road interchanges were completely upgraded. The highway with the improvement project also upgraded all signage to new overhead signage.

It runs from Interstate 74 (I-74) in East Peoria north to IL 78 at Mt. Carroll, just south of U.S. Route 52 (US 52) and IL 64.  Route description  Bob Michel Bridge carrying Illinois Route 40 over the Illinois River. Illinois 40 is known as Knoxville Avenue in the Peoria area, generally south of Illinois Route 6. Route 40 crosses over Interstate 74 north of downtown, and then grows complex in the downtown area, as there are three turns in a one-block length. Illinois 40 then emerges onto William Kumpf Boulevard and crosses over the Illinois River using the Bob Michel Bridge. On the other side of the river, Illinois 40 is briefly called Washington Street. It then is routed onto an onramp to Interstate 74, where there is an exit to Camp Street before terminating at I-74.  History  Originally, SBI Route 40 ran from Sterling to Stockton. In 1935, IL 40 got cut back to Mount Carroll in favor of IL 78. By 1938, Illinois Route 88 entirely acquired IL 40 north of Sterling. In 1987, Illinois Route 5, a four-lane freeway which crosses Illinois 40, was designated Interstate 88 east of I-80. As of 1995, IDOT redesignated Illinois 88 as Illinois 40 to prevent confusion. Although the new number is also the number of a Federal Highway that passes through Illinois (U.S. Route 40), a great enough distance exists between them that the possibility of confusing one for the other is negligible. IL 40 in Peoria County, north of IL 90 Prior to 2003, the Illinois 40 exit on I-74 southeast of Peoria was called \\"Industrial Spur\\". As part of the Upgrade 74 Project, the exit was renamed by the Illinois Department of Transportation to Riverfront Drive.

The California-based investment group Bertram Capital purchased AuthorHouse in 2007 from Gazelle TechVentures, which had owned AuthorHouse since 2002. Later in 2007, Bertram established Author Solutions and acquired AuthorHouse competitor iUniverse, before relocating its operations to Indiana in early 2008. Brandewyne lawsuit In August 2006, a Kansas trial court ordered AuthorHouse to pay $240,000 in punitive damage as well as $230,000 in actual damage to romance author Rebecca Brandewyne and her parents for publishing a book by her ex-husband that was \\"harmful\\" and libelous of them. AuthorHouse was also ordered to pay $20,000 each to Brandewyne's parents for the damage. Although the court acknowledged that AuthorHouse employed a business model that placed a degree of responsibility for the content of works upon the authors, in this case they found that AuthorHouse had failed to act when it was informed that the book might include libelous content.

Historical overview  Archbishop's Palace in Uppsala, designed in the 18th century by the architect Carl H√•rleman, but built on older foundations. There have been bishops in Uppsala from the time of Swedish King Ingold the Elder in the 11th century. They were governed by the archbishop of Hamburg- Bremen until Uppsala was made an archbishopric in 1164. The archbishop in Lund (which at that time belonged to Denmark) was declared primate of Sweden, meaning it was his right to select and ordain the Uppsala archbishop by handing him the pallium. To gain independence, Folke Johansson √Ñngel in 1274 went to Rome and was ordained directly by the pope. This practice was increasing, so that no Uppsala archbishop was in Lund after Olov Bj√∂rnsson, in 1318. In 1457, the archbishop J√∂ns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) was allowed by the pope to declare himself primate of Sweden. Uppsala (then a village) was originally located a couple of miles to the north of the present city, in what is today known as Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala). In 1273, the archbishopric, together with the relics of King Eric the Saint, was moved to the market town of √ñstra Aros, which from then on is named Uppsala. Uppsala Cathedral, seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala. In 1531, Laurentius Petri was chosen by King Gustav I of Sweden (Vasa) to be archbishop, taking that privilege from the pope and in effect making Sweden Protestant. The archbishop was then declared primus inter pares i.e. first among equals. The archbishop is both bishop of his diocese and Primate of Sweden; he has however no more authority than other bishops, although in effect his statements have a more widespread effect. In 2000, the Archbishop of Uppsala was aided in the diocese by a bishop of Uppsala, most recently Ragnar Persenius until his retirement in 2019. Notable archbishops The labours of the archbishops extended in all directions. Some were zealous pastors of their flocks, such as Jarler and others; some were distinguished canonists, such as Birger Gregerson (1367‚Äì83) and Olof Larsson (1435-8); others were statesmen, such as J√∂ns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna (d. 1467), or capable administrators, such as Jacob Ulfsson √ñrnfot, who was distinguished as a prince of the Church, royal councillor, patron of art and learning, founder of the University of Upsala and an efficient helper in the introduction of printing into Sweden. There were also scholars, such as Johannes Magnus (died 1544), who wrote the \\"Historia de omnibus Gothorum sueonumque regibus\\" and the \\"Historia metropolitan√¶ ecclesi√¶ Upsaliensis\\", and his brother Olaus Magnus (d. 1588), who wrote the \\"Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus\\" and who was the last Catholic Archbishop of Upsala.Catholic Encyclopedia: Upsala The archbishops and secular clergy found active co-workers among the regular clergy (i.e. religious orders). Among the orders represented in Sweden were the Benedictines, Cistercians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Brigittines (with the mother-house at Wadstena) and Carthusians. A Swedish Protestant investigator, Carl Silfverstolpe, wrote: \\"The monks were almost the sole bond of union in the Middle Ages between the civilization of the north and that of southern Europe, and it can be claimed that the active relations between our monasteries and those in southern lands were the arteries through which the higher civilization reached our country.\\" See Birger Gregersson (1366‚Äì83; hymnist and author), Nils Ragvaldsson (1438‚Äì48; early adherent of Old Norse mythology), J√∂ns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) (1448‚Äì67; King of Sweden), Jakob Ulfsson (1470‚Äì1514; founder of Uppsala University), Gustav Trolle (1515‚Äì21; supporter of the Danish King), Johannes Magnus (1523-26: wrote an imaginative Scandianian Chronicle), Laurentius Petri (1531‚Äì73; main character behind the Swedish Lutheran reformation), Abraham Angermannus (1593‚Äì99; controversial critic of the King), Olaus Martini (1601‚Äì09), Petrus Kenicius (1609‚Äì36), Laurentius Paulinus Gothus (1637‚Äì46; astronomer and philosopher of Ramus school), Johannes Canuti Lenaeus (1647‚Äì69; aristotelean and logician), Erik Benzelius the Elder (1700‚Äì09; highly knowledgeable), Haquin Spegel (1711‚Äì14; public educator), Mattias Steuchius (1714‚Äì30), Uno von Troil (1786‚Äì1803; politician), Jakob Axelsson Lindblom (1805‚Äì19), Johan Olof Wallin (1837‚Äì39; beloved poet and hymnist), Karl Fredrik af Wing√•rd (1839‚Äì51; politician), Henrik Reuterdahl (1856‚Äì70) Anton Niklas Sundberg (1870‚Äì1900; outspoken and controversial) and Nathan S√∂derblom (1914‚Äì1931; Nobel Prize winner).  Earliest bishops  The first written mention of a bishop at Uppsala is from Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum that records in passing Adalvard the Younger appointed as the bishop for Sictunam et Ubsalam in the 1060s.See Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum , online text in Latin; scholia 94. Swedish sources never mention him either in Sigtuna or Uppsala. The medieval Annales Suecici Medii Aevi. The Annales were written in the Sigtuna Abbey. See an article by the Foteviken Museum. and the 13th century legend of Saint BotvidSaint Botvid in the New Catholic Dictionary . Botvid had been converted to Christianity in England. He was martyred around 1100 in Sweden. Some sources claim that he was murdered by a Finnish slave. See also . mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint's newly built church.See . In Swedish. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna. Also he is omitted from, or at least redated in, the first list of bishops made in the 15th century.Heikkil√§, Tuomas (2005), Pyh√§n Henrikin Legenda, SKS, . Page 60. In this list, the first bishop at Uppsala was Sverinius (Siwardus?), succeeded by Nicolaus, Sveno, Henricus and Kopmannus. With the exception of Henricus, the list only mentions their names.Article Gamla Uppsala, Nordisk Familjebok, 1908See . Hosted by the University of Columbia. In Latin. Archbishops before the Reformation Insignia of Stefan = 12th century = * 1164-1185 Stefan * 1185-1187 Johannes. Johannes was ordained by the Archbishop of Lund, Absalon by November 1185. In 1187, a ship from the pagan Estonia entered M√§laren, a lake close to Uppsala, on a plundering expedition. It sailed to Sigtuna, a prosperous city at that time, and plundered it. On its way back, barricades were set up at the only exit point at Almarest√§ket to prevent the ship from escaping. Johannes was there also. As the ship struggled to pass through, Johannes were among those killed. * 1187-1197 Petrus. He was ordained by Absalon. Sweden got a new king, Sverker II of Sweden in 1196, who was related to the Danish Royal Court, whereby Absalon extended his authority over Sweden. When Petrus in 1196 elected three bishops, Absalon requested that the pope decide since the bishops were the sons of other priests, and this was not allowed by papal decree. He also mentioned that several Swedish bishops refused to travel to his synods. Absalon was an authoritative person whom the pope trusted and gave him rights, but by the time the message reached Uppsala Petrus had already died. = 13th century= * 1198-1206 Olov Lambatunga. In 1200, Pope Innocent III demanded that Church estate be free from the king's taxes and that clerics be judged only by bishops and prelates, and not civil courts and judges. This was a step in the separation between worldly and spiritual matters, which the Swedish Church had not yet taken. Innocent also demanded that Olov dismiss the two bishops ordained by Petrus. When Uppsala burnt in 1204, Olov's pallium was burnt and he sent a request to Innocent III for a new one to be made. * 1207-1219 Valerius. Valerius was most likely the son of a church man - and the Archbishop of Lund appealed the election to Rome. The pope allowed a dispensation for Valerius on the grounds that there was no other suitable candidate and because Valierus was known as a learned man with good customs and virtues. Valerius joined sides with the King Sverker II of Sweden who belonged to the House of Sverker. The House of Sverker was one of the antagonists in a civil war that had been going on and off since 1130. In 1208 the opposing side, the House of Eric, besieged the capital Stockholm; Sverker and Valierus fled to Denmark. Sverker gathered a small army in Denmark and tried to conquer Sweden but was killed. Valerius then decided to accept King Eric X's authority, and as a result was allowed to return to Uppsala, where he crowned Eric X in 1210. Pope Innocent III sent a letter to Valerius where he proclaimed the procedure to be unauthorised and unlawful, but it seems to have had little impact. * 1219(1224)-1234 Olov Basat√∂mer. N/A * 1236-1255 Jarler He was one of the first known Swedish students at the University of Paris. As archbishop, he established several clerical regulations. * 1255-1267 Lars (Laurentius). Lars was recruited from the recently established Franciscan monastery in Enk√∂ping and was most likely a foreigner. The Pope expressed trust in the recently crowned Swedish monarch Birger Jarl who, unlike his predecessors, had promised to support the Church by granting it freedom from taxes and establish missionaries to yet un-Christianised parts - or parts who had returned to paganism - specifically Finland and the Baltic states. But this promise was not realised because of the shaky political situation in Sweden. There was an ongoing struggle for power, which eventually forced the antagonists to tax Church property in order to support the war. Lars tried to impose clerical celibacy, which still had not been enforced in Sweden because the low population figures in Sweden required priests to marry and have children. In 1258 Lars sent Pope Alexander IV a request that married clergy not be excommunicated, a request which indicates married clergy were not uncommon. Also in 1258 the move of the archdiocese to its present location was decided, but it would not take effect for another decade. * 1267-1277 Folke Johansson √Ñngel (Fulco Angelus). Folke belonged to the influential family √Ñngel, which used the Archangel Gabriel as a heraldic charge. He was, for unclear reasons, not ordained until 1274. Civil disturbances may have been a cause, but also the reluctance of the cathedral chapter to be under the authority of Lund. In 1274, Folke ignored the Primate of Lund by travelling to Rome and getting ordained by Pope Gregory X himself. Folke's most important contribution was to commission the moving of the episcopal see from its old location to its present location. At his death he was one of the first to be buried in Uppsala Cathedral.\\"√Ñngel\\", in NF (1894) * 1277-1281 Jakob Israelsson Was from the same family as his predecessor.

Had served as prior at the Sigtuna monastery and Bishop of √Öbo. Died in Avignon while travelling to Rome to receive the pallium. = 14th century= * 1292-1305 Nils Allesson (Nicolaus Allonius). He studied at the University of Paris in 1278. After returning to Sweden, he became deacon in Uppsala in 1286 and was elected archbishop in 1292. As Nils Allesson was the son of a priest, the cathedral chapter in Lund, Denmark - the primate over Uppsala - appealed the election to the pope. Nils travelled to Rome in 1295 to meet the Pope Boniface VIII and defend his case, which was eventually accepted. Nils was known as a vigorous archbishop. He founded and supervised institutions for safety and order around the archdiocese, such as accommodations for travellers.Article Nils Alleson in Nordisk Familjebok, 1887 * 1308-1314 Nils Kettilsson Little is known about him. * 1315-1332 Olov Bj√∂rnsson (Olov the Wise; Olavus sapiens). Under his time the chapter in Uppsala stopped accepting Archbishop of Lund as primate, and Olov was to be the last Uppsala archbishop to be ordained there.Article Olov Bj√∂rnsson in Nordisk Familjebok, 1888 * 1332-1341 Petrus Filipsson (Petrus Philippi). He came from a smaller town in Uppland, the son of the knight Filip Finnvedson, one of the most important men in Uppland (the land of Uppsala). Petrus held various clerical offices until he was elected archbishop. Following the election he travelled to Avignon, the residence of Pope John XXII, to be ordained as bishop. He had a strained relationship with the Franciscan order. At the request of Pope Benedict XII, Paul, Archbishop of Nidaros (now Trondheim) in Norway, was to make a judgement on the matter, and this led to a settlement between the two parties in 1339. In 1341 Petrus died and was buried in Sigtuna's Dominican order church which today is called Mariakyrkan.Article Petrus in Nordisk Familjebok, 1915 * 1341-1351 Hemming Nilsson. At the death of Petrus, Pope Benedict XII wished to occupy the archbishop's seat through commission, but following Hemming's election by the cathedral chapter, Hemming travelled to Avignon and persuaded Benedict to ordain him bishop. During his time, he helped in the political world, made a visitation through Norway and established Uppsala ecclesiastical records. His last will shows that he was also quite wealthy. * 1351-1366 Petrus Torkilsson (Petrus Tyrgilli; died 19 October 1366). The first mention of him is from 1320, when he was vicar in F√§rentuna. He was chancellor of the King Magnus II of Sweden in 1340 and continued to support him during through the 1360s when Sweden was in a civil war. In 1342 he was appointed Bishop of Link√∂ping, where he assisted the building of the Link√∂ping Cathedral. He was assessor during King Magnus monetary transactions, among them the repayment of a loan Magnus hade made from the Church. After the new King Albert of Sweden took power, Petrus supported him as well. * 1366-1383 Birger Gregersson. Was known as a vigorous archbishop. He was also a supporter of the Swedish, highly revered, Saint Birgitta (1303-1373), and wrote a biography of her. He also wrote in honour of her and of Saint Botvid, another Swedish saint. As a writer, he has a prominent place in early Swedish literature.Article Birger Gregersson, in Nordisk Familjebok, 1906 * 1383-1408 Henrik Karlsson (Henricus Caroli). Was also friends with Saint Birgitta, in Rome and took part in the important political decisions during his years as archbishop, such as the Kalmar Union in 1397. Had a good economical skill, was a wealthy man, and acquired many farms for the Church. At his death, he left them to the cathedral chapter, but Queen Margaret is said to have taken them in possession instead, which marked the beginning of disputes between the chapter and the states in the union (which lasted until 1520).Article Henrik Karlsson in Nordisk Familjebok, 1909 = 15th century= * 1408-1421 J√∂ns Gerekesson (Johannes Gerechini) J√∂ns originated the influential Danish family Lodehat. His uncle was bishop of Roskilde and a former chancellor of the Queen. J√∂ns himself became, thanks to his family's Royal connection, chancellor to the King of Scandinavia, Eric of Pomerania. At the death of the Archbishop Henrik, King Eric appointed J√∂ns, who had no connection to Uppsala, as new archbishop without regards to the candidates of the chapter. During his time, J√∂ns paid little respect to the duties of archbishop. He embessled Church property and mistreated Church officials. Eventually, the chapter complained to the Pope, who conducted an investigation and dismissed J√∂ns Gereksson in 1421. * 1421-1432 Johan H√•kansson (Johannes Haquini) Was originally a monk at Vadstena monastery. As archbishop, he freed clericals of taxation, and built a permanent house for the archbishop. * 1432-1438 Olov Larsson (Olaus Laurentii) * 1433-1434 Arnold of Bergen (unofficial) (Arend in Norwegian; died 1434) was bishop of Bergen, Norway, and was never ordained as archbishop. When Olaus Laurentii was elected by the Chapter to become Archbishop of Uppsala and Sweden, the Swedish King Eric of Pomerania was displeased because he was not consulted and therefore decided that Arnold of Bergen should become archbishop in 1433 while Olaus Laurentii was in Rome to be ordained. Arnold moved into the archbishopseat in Uppsala despite protests from the chapter. The quarrels were resolved when Arnold died in 1434; then the king decided to accept Olaus Laurentii who had just returned from Rome. * 1438-1448 Nils Ragvaldsson (Nicolaus Ragvaldi) * 1448-1467 J√∂ns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) * 1468-1469 Tord Pedersson (Bonde) (not ordained) * 1469-1515 Jakob Ulvsson * 1515-1517 and 1520-1521 Gustav Trolle Gustav Eriksson Trolle (1488‚Äì1533) was a controversial person. He was in dispute with the king, since he was a supporter of the Danish King Christian II. In 1515 he was removed from office, but barricaded himself in the archbishop's mansion/fortress at Almarest√§ket, until an assembly of chancellors ordered its destruction in 1517. In 1520, Danish King Christian conquered Swedish territory, and Gustav was reinstated. However, King Christian's reign in Sweden lasted but one year, and in 1521 Gustav was forced to flee to Denmark to seek refuge. When the Pope months later received news of the deposition of Trolle, he ordered the reigning Swedish King Gustav Vasa to reinstate Trolle, not realizing the severity of the matter. Not being allowed to have his selected archbishop consecrated, King Gustav Vasa in effect broke away from the Catholic tradition, making Sweden a Lutheran nation starting 1531. Archbishops during the Reformation Seal of Johannes Magnus * 1523-1544 Johannes Magnus Johannes Magnus was the last Catholic archbishop of Sweden. He was selected to be archbishop in 1523, but the Pope deemed the disposal of Gustav Trolle unlawful and demanded that he be reinstated. The Swedish king, Gustav Vasa, therefore broke with the Catholic Church and himself ordained Johannes Magnus. But before long, Magnus expressed disapproval of Lutheran teachings, so Gustav Vasa sent him to Russia as a diplomat in 1526. Gustav Vasa appointed a new archbishop, Laurentius Petri, in 1531, and Johannes realized that his time as archbishop was over. He travelled to Rome where he stayed for the rest of his life.Article Johannes Magnus, in Nordisk Familjebok, 1910 * 1544-1557 Olaus Magnus Brother of the previous, with whom he was in exile in Rome. After the death of his brother, Olaus was consecrated by the Pope in 1544, but he never returned home. He was the last Swedish archbishop to get papal consecration. Staying in Rome, Olaus wrote several highly regarded works about Scandinavia that still interest readers today. He also had works by his brother Johannes published.  Archbishops after the Reformation  = 16th century = * 1531-1573 Laurentius Petri (Nericius) He and his brother Olaus Petri were the main Protestant reformers in Sweden; while his brother was more energetic, Laurentius laid the theoretical foundation for the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571. * 1575-1579 Laurentius Petri Gothus Before becoming archbishop, Gothus appears to have been inclined towards King Johan III of Sweden's more Catholic viewpoint. He was for this reason ordained by the King in a Catholic ritual with all its apparatus, and wrote the introduction to the King's \\"red book\\". As the Jesuitic tendencies grew stronger in Sweden in the 1570s, he became more wary; he refused to support the views of the King any longer, and published Contra novas papistarum machinationes which, although it gives proper respect to the Church fathers, polemizes against the foundation of Catholicism and the Jesuits. * 1583-1591 Andreas Laurentii Bj√∂rnram He was vicar in G√§vle 1570 and is reported as one of the first priests to have used the King's \\"red book\\" in his sermons, which sparked the King's interest, and he subsequently appointed him archbishop after a four-year vacancy. Bj√∂rnram upset Church officials by declaring that the liturgy of the King was in accordance with the Apostles' Creed and that he supported it. Surprisingly, he nonetheless advocated the reading of Luther's works. * 1593-1599 Abraham Angermannus Angermannus first became known as a critic of the liturgy of King John, and the king had him put in jail in √Öbo, Finland. He managed to escape back to Stockholm with the protection of influential friends, but he eventually had to flee to Germany, where he lived for 11 years. He visited the renowned universities there and wrote several books with Lutheran contents aimed at Swedish readers. In 1593, the cathedral chapter of Uppsala elected him archbishop, and he moved back to Sweden. He was a harsh critic of Catholic remnants which were still adhered to in Sweden. In 1599, the king had had enough of him and prosecuted him. Angermannus was put in prison in Gripsholm, where he was forced to remain until his death in 1607.Article Abrahamus Andre√¶ Angermannus, in Nordisk Familjebok, 1904 * 1599-1600 Nicolaus Olai Bothniensis (not ordained) Like his predecessor Angermannus, Bothniensis was imprisoned for 1.5 years due to his resistance to John III's non-Lutheran liturgy.

The process starts at 0 and is stopped as soon as it hits 1. In probability theory, in particular in the study of stochastic processes, a stopping time (also Markov time, Markov moment, optional stopping time or optional time ) is a specific type of ‚Äúrandom time‚Äù: a random variable whose value is interpreted as the time at which a given stochastic process exhibits a certain behavior of interest. A stopping time is often defined by a stopping rule, a mechanism for deciding whether to continue or stop a process on the basis of the present position and past events, and which will almost always lead to a decision to stop at some finite time. Stopping times occur in decision theory, and the optional stopping theorem is an important result in this context. Stopping times are also frequently applied in mathematical proofs to ‚Äútame the continuum of time‚Äù, as Chung put it in his book (1982). Definition = Discrete time = Let tau be a random variable, which is defined on the filtered probability space (Omega, mathcal F, (mathcal F_n)_{n in N}, P) with values in mathbb N cup { +infty }. Then tau is called a stopping time (with respect to the filtration mathbb F= ((mathcal F_n)_{n in N} ), if the following condition holds: : { tau =n } in mathcal F_n for all n Intuitively, this condition means that the \\"decision\\" of whether to stop at time n must be based only on the information present at time n, not on any future information. = General case = Let tau be a random variable, which is defined on the filtered probability space (Omega, mathcal F, (mathcal F_t)_{t in T}, P) with values in T. In most cases, T=[0,+ infty) . Then tau is called a stopping time (with respect to the filtration mathbb F= (mathcal F_t)_{t in T} ), if the following condition holds: : { tau leq t } in mathcal F_t for all t in T = As adapted process = Let tau be a random variable, which is defined on the filtered probability space (Omega, mathcal F, (mathcal F_t)_{t in T}, P) with values in T. Then tau is called a stopping time iff the stochastic process X=(X_t)_{t in T}, defined by : X_t:= begin{cases} 1 & text{ if } t leq tau  0 &text{ if } t > tau end{cases} is adapted to the filtration mathbb F= (mathcal F_t)_{t in T} = Comments = Some authors explicitly exclude cases where tau can be + infty , whereas other authors allow tau to take any value in the closure of T. Examples To illustrate some examples of random times that are stopping rules and some that are not, consider a gambler playing roulette with a typical house edge, starting with $100 and betting $1 on red in each game: *Playing exactly five games corresponds to the stopping time œÑ = 5, and is a stopping rule. *Playing until he either runs out of money or has played 500 games is a stopping rule. *Playing until he is the maximum amount ahead he will ever be is not a stopping rule and does not provide a stopping time, as it requires information about the future as well as the present and past. *Playing until he doubles his money (borrowing if necessary) is not a stopping rule, as there is a positive probability that he will never double his money. *Playing until he either doubles his money or runs out of money is a stopping rule, even though there is potentially no limit to the number of games he plays, since the probability that he stops in a finite time is 1. To illustrate the more general definition of stopping time, consider Brownian motion, which is a stochastic process (B_t)_{tgeq 0}, where each B_t is a random variable defined on the probability space (Omega, mathcal{F}, mathbb{P}). We define a filtration on this probability space by letting mathcal{F}_t be the œÉ-algebra generated by all the sets of the form (B_s)^{-1}(A) where 0leq s leq t and Asubseteq mathbb{R} is a Borel set. Intuitively, an event E is in mathcal{F}_t if and only if we can determine whether E is true or false just by observing the Brownian motion from time 0 to time t. * Every constant tau:=t_0 is (trivially) a stopping time; it corresponds to the stopping rule \\"stop at time t_0\\". * Let ainmathbb{R}. Then tau:=inf {tgeq 0 mid B_t > a} is a stopping time for Brownian motion, corresponding to the stopping rule: \\"stop as soon as the Brownian motion exceeds the value a.\\" * Another stopping time is given by tau:=inf {tgeq 1 mid B_s > 0 text{ for all } sin[t-1,t]}. It corresponds to the stopping rule \\"stop as soon as the Brownian motion has been positive over a contiguous stretch of length 1 time unit.\\" * In general, if œÑ1 and œÑ2 are stopping times on left(Omega, mathcal{F}, left{ mathcal{F}_{t} right }_{t geq 0}, mathbb{P}right) then their minimum tau _1 wedge tau _2, their maximum tau _1 vee tau _2, and their sum œÑ1 + œÑ2 are also stopping times. (This is not true for differences and products, because these may require \\"looking into the future\\" to determine when to stop.) Hitting times like the second example above can be important examples of stopping times. While it is relatively straightforward to show that essentially all stopping times are hitting times, it can be much more difficult to show that a certain hitting time is a stopping time. The latter types of results are known as the D√©but theorem. Localization Stopping times are frequently used to generalize certain properties of stochastic processes to situations in which the required property is satisfied in only a local sense. First, if X is a process and œÑ is a stopping time, then XœÑ is used to denote the process X stopped at time œÑ. : X^tau_t=X_{min(t,tau)} Then, X is said to locally satisfy some property P if there exists a sequence of stopping times œÑn, which increases to infinity and for which the processes :mathbf{1}_{{tau_n>0}}X^{tau_n} satisfy property P. Common examples, with time index set I = [0, ‚àû), are as follows: > Local martingale process. A process X is a local martingale if it is c√†dl√†g > and there exists a sequence of stopping times œÑn increasing to infinity, > such that :mathbf{1}_{{tau_n>0}}X^{tau_n} is a martingale for each n. > Locally integrable process. A non-negative and increasing process X is > locally integrable if there exists a sequence of stopping times œÑn > increasing to infinity, such that :operatorname{E} left > [mathbf{1}_{{tau_n>0}}X^{tau_n} right ]<infty for each n. Types of stopping times Stopping times, with time index set I = [0,‚àû), are often divided into one of several types depending on whether it is possible to predict when they are about to occur. A stopping time œÑ is predictable if it is equal to the limit of an increasing sequence of stopping times œÑn satisfying œÑn < œÑ whenever œÑ > 0. The sequence œÑn is said to announce œÑ, and predictable stopping times are sometimes known as announceable. Examples of predictable stopping times are hitting times of continuous and adapted processes. If œÑ is the first time at which a continuous and real valued process X is equal to some value a, then it is announced by the sequence œÑn, where œÑn is the first time at which X is within a distance of 1/n of a. Accessible stopping times are those that can be covered by a sequence of predictable times. That is, stopping time œÑ is accessible if, P(œÑ = œÑn for some n) = 1, where œÑn are predictable times. A stopping time œÑ is totally inaccessible if it can never be announced by an increasing sequence of stopping times. Equivalently, P(œÑ = œÉ < ‚àû) = 0 for every predictable time œÉ. Examples of totally inaccessible stopping times include the jump times of Poisson processes. Every stopping time œÑ can be uniquely decomposed into an accessible and totally inaccessible time. That is, there exists a unique accessible stopping time œÉ and totally inaccessible time œÖ such that œÑ = œÉ whenever œÉ < ‚àû, œÑ = œÖ whenever œÖ < ‚àû, and œÑ = ‚àû whenever œÉ = œÖ = ‚àû. Note that in the statement of this decomposition result, stopping times do not have to be almost surely finite, and can equal ‚àû. Stopping rules in clinical trials Clinical trials in medicine often perform interim analysis, in order to determine whether the trial has already met its endpoints. However, interim analysis create the risk of false-positive results, and therefore stopping boundaries are used to determine the number and timing of interim analysis (also known as alpha-spending, to denote the rate of false positives). At each of R interim tests, the trial is stopped if the likelihood is below a threshold p, which depends on the method used. See Sequential analysis.

Her first anthology of poems, Amrit Lehran (\\"Immortal Waves\\") was published in 1936, at age sixteen, the year she married Pritam Singh, an editor to whom she was engaged in early childhood, and changed her name from Amrit Kaur to Amrita Pritam.Amrita Pritam ‚Äì Obituary The Independent, 2 November 2005. Half a dozen collections of poems were to follow between 1936 and 1943. Though she began her journey as a romantic poet, soon she shifted gears, and became part of the Progressive Writers' Movement and its effect was seen in her collection, Lok Peed (\\"People's Anguish\\", 1944), which openly criticised the war-torn economy, after the Bengal famine of 1943. She was also involved in social work to a certain extent and participated in such activities wholeheartedly, after Independence when social activist Guru Radha Kishan took the initiative to bring the first Janta Library in Delhi, which was inaugurated by Balraj Sahni and Aruna Asaf Ali and contributed to the occasion accordingly. This study centre cum library is still running at Clock Tower, Delhi. She also worked at a radio station in Lahore for a while, before the partition of India.Editorial Daily Times (Pakistan), 2 November 2005. M. S.

Subsequently, in 1947, while she was pregnant with her son, and travelling from Dehradun to Delhi, she expressed anguish on a piece of paperAn alternative voice of history Monica Datta, The Hindu, 4 December 2005. like the poem, \\"Ajj Aakhaan Waris Shah Nu\\" (I ask Waris Shah Today); this poem was to later immortalize her and become the most poignant reminder of the horrors of Partition.Juggling two lives The Hindu, 13 November 2005. The poem addressed to the Sufi poet Waris Shah, author of the tragic saga of Heer and Ranjah and with whom she shares her birthplace. Amrita Pritam worked until 1961 in the Punjabi service of All India Radio, Delhi. After her divorce in 1960, her work became more feminist. Many of her stories and poems drew on the unhappy experience of her marriage. A number of her works have been translated into English, French, Danish, Japanese, Mandarin, and other languages from Punjabi and Urdu, including her autobiographical works Black Rose and Rasidi Ticket (Revenue Stamp). The first of Amrita Pritam's books to be filmed was Dharti Sagar te Sippiyan, as Kadambari (1965), followed by Unah Di Kahani, as Daaku (Dacoit, 1976), directed by Basu Bhattacharya. Her novel Pinjar (The Skeleton, 1950) narrates the story of partition riots along with the crisis of women who suffered during the times. It was made into an award-winning Hindi movie by Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, because of its humanism: \\"Amritaji has portrayed the suffering of people of both the countries.\\" Pinjar was shot in a border region of Rajasthan and Punjab. She edited Nagmani, a monthly literary magazine in Punjabi for several years, which she ran together with Imroz, for 33 years; though after Partition she wrote prolifically in Hindi as well. Later in life, she turned to Osho and wrote introductions for several books of Osho, including Ek Onkar Satnam,A tribute to Amrita Pritam by Osho lovers Sw.

These destroyers retained their original hull numbers. Later, in March 1950, the post World War II ASW destroyer (DDK) classification was merged with the DDE classification, resulting in all DDK ships being reclassified as DDE, but again retaining their original hull numbers. On 30 June 1962, the DDE classification was retired, and all DDEs were reclassified as destroyers (DD). Escort destroyers should not be confused with the cheaper, slower, less capable, and more lightly armed World War II destroyer escorts. Weapon Alpha replacing mount 52. Concept Following the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had inadequate numbers of warships suitable for escort of trade convoys. While more modern destroyers were assigned to screen capital ships, destroyers built during World War I were modified to serve as trade convoy escorts. Four V and W-class destroyers were re-armed with modern anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons. Additional V & W destroyers received simpler modifications as shipyard resources became taxed by other wartime needs. The quarterdeck gun was removed to increase depth charge storage, and the after bank of torpedo tubes was replaced by a anti-aircraft gun for escort of convoys in European coastal waters. Destroyers escorting trans-Atlantic convoys also replaced the forecastle gun with hedgehog, removed all torpedo tubes to improve seaworthiness, and replaced one boiler with additional fuel storage to increase range. Similar modifications were made to former United States destroyers obtained through the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Anticipating a possible need to defend convoys supplying NATO allies, the United States Navy modified older destroyers during the Cold War. In the absence of hostilities requiring escort of merchant shipping, escort destroyers operated with anti-submarine warfare carrier (CVS) hunter-killer groups. Operational doctrine anticipated each CVS would be accompanied by eight DDEs. Four DDEs would provide a close screen for the CVS while the other four attacked submarines detected by aircraft. Gearing class conversions were modified by replacing the B position 5\\"/38 caliber guns (mount 52) with either RUR-4 Weapon Alpha or hedgehog. A second Weapon Alpha was sometimes installed at the aft end of the 01 level above the aft 5\\"/38 gun mount. Fletcher class conversions removed all torpedo tubes and three 5\\"/38 caliber gun mounts to retain only the main deck mounts fore and aft. A Weapon Alpha replaced the B position gun mount. Similar modifications were made by the Royal Navy, usually to older, World War I era vessels, to fit them for specific tasks such as convoy work.

Marie. The area is served by the Weymouth Fire Department. History The area was settled in the 1760s by New England Planters. The town was formally founded by Loyalist James Moody in 1783 (the year that the Treaty of Paris was signed to end the American Revolution). Current-day Weymouth was once called Weymouth Bridge, and Weymouth North was called Weymouth. Weymouth is supposed to have been named in honour of the previous settlement of the Strickland family from Weymouth, Massachusetts. Shipping and shipbuilding were the main industry in the mid-19th century. Remnants of docks can be seen on the Northeast side of the Sissiboo today. Goods such as lumber were loaded on ships at these docks and shipped all over the world. Until recently, Weymouth housed the oldest general store in Eastern Canada. Opened in 1837, the store was called The Trading Post, but closed in 2009. The village also houses one of the original offices of the Merchants Bank of Halifax (later renamed Royal Bank of Canada). This building is now part of the aforementioned Weymouth Trading Post building. The Dominion Atlantic Railway stopped running through Weymouth in March 1990. Sam LangfordNearby Weymouth Falls was home to one of the world's greatest boxers, Sam Langford (1886‚Äì1956). Although he was never officially crowned World Champion, he held titles from England, Spain and Mexico.http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~ai477/sam.html =Disasters= On 4 August 1909, 2 churches, a hotel, and several other buildings were destroyed by fire. On 2 October 1929 a fire started in the general store of Captain R.D. Barkhouse and swept through the downtown area destroying 25 buildings including retail shops, factories, and private homes. It was estimated that the fire caused approximately $250,000 in damages. No serious injuries or deaths occurred because of the fire. On 6 February 1958, another fire destroyed the boat and furniture plants of Weymouth Industries Ltd., and in June 1959 six businesses were wiped out due to fire. The Sissiboo River overflowed in March 2003, flooding the town under almost two feet of water. 2017 a fire destroyed 2 building. One of the buildings was one of the oldest buildings in Canada. The fire also damaged 3 other buildings. 9 fire Departments and over 130 firefighters were on scene = New France (\\"Electric City\\") = The lumber community of New France, located about inland from Weymouth, was founded by the Stehelin family who came to the area from Normandy, France in 1892. The community they established was notable for its early use of hydroelectric power generation, earning it the local nickname \\"The Electric City\\". Also notable was the Stehelin family's railroad, the Weymouth and New France Railway, constructed using logs as tracks, which they used to bring lumber to the company wharf at Weymouth. As many as 1.5 million board feet of timber were shipped annually from New France to South America and England. The railway was destroyed by fire in 1907 and the business ceased not long afterwards. There is little left of New France except for the foundations of the city buildings. J.D. Irving, recent owners of the land, established walking trails and interpretive signs at the site and fixed the foundations so they are safe for visitors to explore. The lands were purchased by the Province of Nova Scotia on 3 February 2010, thus assuring the protection of this unusual part of the province.Mike Parker, Buried in the Woods: Sawmill Ghost Towns of Nova Scotia, Pottersfield Press, 2010, pp. 93‚Äì118 Geography Modern day Weymouth straddles the Sissiboo River. This river swells approximately every six hours as salt water backs up from the high tides of the Bay of Fundy into St. Mary's Bay. Weymouth is situated on the border between the provincial electoral districts of Clare and Digby- Annapolis.Elections Nova Scotia, http://www.electionsnovascotia.ns.ca It is located 33 kilometres from Digby, 72 kilometres from Yarmouth and 250 kilometres from the capital of Nova Scotia, Halifax. Smaller villages surrounding Weymouth proper are Weymouth Falls, Weaver Settlement, Ohio, Southville, Riverdale, Danvers, Hassett, Saint Bernard and New Edinburgh. Two exits (27 and 28) on Highway 101 are the primary access to the town. Trunk 1 runs through the village and was the main thoroughfare from the Annapolis Valley to Yarmouth prior to the construction of Highway 101. =Climate= Economy Fur farming, especially mink, fishing, and logging are the principal industries in the area. Demographics The Village of Weymouth comprises many different ethnic backgrounds. Primarily populated by descendants of the loyalists, African-Canadian and White, it also is home to a few Acadians, Mi'kmaq and people of German ancestry.

It begins as a northern extension of Interstate 474 at Interstate 74 west of Peoria, and ends at Illinois Route 29 at the 9th Mile in Mossville, south of Chillicothe. The freeway currently has a total length of 10.11 miles (16.27 km), including the connector ramp to Illinois 29.  Route description  Although fairly short, Illinois 6 draws more traffic than a rural highway because it passes through the developing north and northwest edge of Peoria. A one-mile (1.6 km) stretch of road around the U.S. Route 150 (War Memorial Drive) exit has become a major commercial development area that now includes a major mall and a nearby strip mall with over 30 movie screens between them. In addition, new development is occurring rapidly around the other interchanges of Allen Road (old Illinois Route 174), Knoxville Avenue (Illinois Route 40), and Illinois Route 29.  History  SBI Route 6 initially ran from Fulton to Chicago. It roughly followed present-day US 30, Illinois Route 38, and Roosevelt Road. In 1935, Illinois 6 was decommissioned and was partly replaced with US 330 (now IL 38/Roosevelt Road) and US 30. The Illinois Route 6 designation remained decommissioned until the early 1980s when the present freeway north of Peoria was finished. By 1988, the freeway was extended to Illinois Route 29 near Mossville. Future Several plans have been considered for continuing the Illinois 6 corridor. One is extending Illinois 6 into a loop by building a bridge over the Illinois River and running the highway south to Interstates 74 and 474 near Interstate 155 in Morton. In 2013, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn proposed a $12.3 billion road plan that earmarked funds for engineering work and corridor studies, renewing interest in connecting Route 6 with I-74.

It commonly occurs as cleavable to compact masses with a rose-red color (the name comes from the Greek ·ø•œåŒ¥ŒøœÇ rhodos, rosy), often tending to brown because of surface oxidation. Rhodonite crystals often have a thick tabular habit, but are rare. It has a perfect, prismatic cleavage, almost at right angles. The hardness is 5.5‚Äì6.5, and the specific gravity is 3.4‚Äì3.7; luster is vitreous, being less frequently pearly on cleavage surfaces. The manganese is often partly replaced by iron, magnesium, calcium, and sometimes zinc, which may sometimes be present in considerable amounts; a greyish-brown variety containing as much as 20% of calcium oxide is called bustamite; fowlerite is a zinciferous variety containing 7% of zinc oxide. Pink rhodonite contrasting with black manganese oxides is sometimes used as gemstone material as seen in this specimen from Humboldt County, Nevada. The inosilicate (chain silicate) structure of rhodonite has a repeat unit of five silica tetrahedra. The rare polymorph pyroxmangite, formed at different conditions of pressure and temperature, has the same chemical composition but a repeat unit of seven tetrahedra. Rhodonite has also been worked as an ornamental stone. In the iron and manganese mines at Pajsberg near Filipstad and L√•ngban in V√§rmland, Sweden, small brilliant and translucent crystals (pajsbergite) and cleavage masses occur. Fowlerite occurs as large, rough crystals, somewhat resembling pink feldspar, with franklinite and zinc ores in granular limestone at Franklin Furnace in New Jersey.

Article 27 of TRIPS Article 27 paragraph 1 of TRIPS provides for that: The only allowable exceptions to this provision are laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same Article 27, and neither software nor computer programs are mentioned therein. The following elements may be excluded from patentability by WTO members under TRIPs: * (...) inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law.(paragraph 2) * diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; (paragraph 3(a)) and * plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes.

However, despite not being mentioned as an exception in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 27 TRIPs, 'pure software' is not considered an invention under European law.Software Patents in Europe, Chairman's Opening Remarks, Speaker: Paul Hartnack, Comptroller General, The Patent Office, Last updated 6 December 2000 (Archive.org). The decision of the contracting states of the TRIPS Agreement, i.e. the WTO member states, was that patents should be granted in all fields of technology, without discrimination (Art. 27(1) TRIPShttp://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips.pdf TRIPS Agreement). However, according to Paul Hartnack, former Comptroller-General of the UK Patent Office, it is arguable whether pure software is a technology, or is, in many cases, capable of industrial application. He argues that its acceptance as such under European jurisdiction would be a political matter based on economic interest. Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties requires \\"ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty\\". The same provision requires interpretation within the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_2_1986.pdf Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties There have been no dispute settlement procedures regarding software patents. Its relevance for patentability in the domains of, for example, computer-implemented business methods, computer science and software information technology remains uncertain, since the TRIPS agreement is subject to interpretation,John Moetteli, The Patentability of Software in the U.S. and Europe, presented at St. Gallen, Switzerland, 28 October 2005, p.3 (pdf), retrieved on 3 July 2006 like all legal texts.  Relationship with copyright protection  Article 10 paragraph 1 of TRIPS provides that a computer program is a type of work which is eligible for protection under copyright law: This argument was used by some adversaries of software patents to contend that software patents would not be allowed by the TRIPS agreement. TRIPS textbooks see no conflict, for instance Correa & Yusuf notes that software patents complement copyright because copyright does not protect underlying ideas.

It was intended that one-third of the Senate would begin new six-year terms with each Congress after the first. Preceding the names in the list below are Senate class numbers, which indicate the cycle of their terms. In this Congress, all Senators were newly elected. Senators of Class 1 served a two-year term, expiring at the end of this Congress, requiring a new election for the 1864‚Äì1870 term. Class 2 Senators served what was intended to be a four-year term, due to end on the expiry of the next Congress in 1866. Class 3 Senators were meant to serve a six-year term, due to expire at the end of the Third Confederate Congress in 1868. As the Confederate Congress lasted less than four full years, the distinction between classes 2 and 3 was ultimately academic. The members of the classes were selected by the drawing of lots, which was done during the meeting of the Senate on February 21, 1862.Permanent Constitution of the Confederate States and Confederate Senate Journal Alabama * 1.

It clearly shows developers how to manage the quality of their products, how to make a sound plan, and how to make commitments. It also offers them the data to justify their plans. They can evaluate their work and suggest improvement direction by analyzing and reviewing development time, defects, and size data. The PSP was created by Watts Humphrey to apply the underlying principles of the Software Engineering Institute's (SEI) Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to the software development practices of a single developer. It claims to give software engineers the process skills necessary to work on a team software process (TSP) team. \\"Personal Software Process\\" and \\"PSP\\" are registered service marks of the Carnegie Mellon University. Objectives The PSP aims to provide software engineers with disciplined methods for improving personal software development processes. The PSP helps software engineers to: * Improve their estimating and planning skills. * Make commitments they can keep. * Manage the quality of their projects. * Reduce the number of defects in their work. PSP structure PSP training follows an evolutionary improvement approach: an engineer learning to integrate the PSP into his or her process begins at the first level ‚Äì PSP0 ‚Äì and progresses in process maturity to the final level ‚Äì PSP2.1. Each Level has detailed scripts, checklists and templates to guide the engineer through required steps and helps the engineer improve their own personal software process. Humphrey encourages proficient engineers to customize these scripts and templates as they gain an understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses. ;Process The input to PSP is the requirements; requirements document is completed and delivered to the engineer. ;PSP0, PSP0.1 (Introduces process discipline and measurement) PSP0 has 3 phases: planning, development (design, code, compile, test) and a post mortem. A baseline is established of current process measuring: time spent on programming, faults injected/removed, size of a program. In a post mortem, the engineer ensures all data for the projects has been properly recorded and analysed. PSP0.1 advances the process by adding a coding standard, a size measurement and the development of a personal process improvement plan (PIP). In the PIP, the engineer records ideas for improving his own process. ;PSP1, PSP1.1 (Introduces estimating and planning) Based upon the baseline data collected in PSP0 and PSP0.1, the engineer estimates how large a new program will be and prepares a test report (PSP1). Accumulated data from previous projects is used to estimate the total time. Each new project will record the actual time spent. This information is used for task and schedule planning and estimation (PSP1.1). ;PSP2, PSP2.1 (Introduces quality management and design) PSP2 adds two new phases: design review and code review. Defect prevention and removal of them are the focus at the PSP2. Engineers learn to evaluate and improve their process by measuring how long tasks take and the number of defects they inject and remove in each phase of development. Engineers construct and use checklists for design and code reviews. PSP2.1 introduces design specification and analysis techniques (PSP3 is a legacy level that has been superseded by TSP.) The importance of data One of the core aspects of the PSP is using historical data to analyze and improve process performance. PSP data collection is supported by four main elements: * Scripts * Measures * Standards * Forms The PSP scripts provide expert-level guidance to following the process steps and they provide a framework for applying the PSP measures. The PSP has four core measures: * Size ‚Äì the size measure for a product part, such as lines of code (LOC). * Effort ‚Äì the time required to complete a task, usually recorded in minutes. * Quality ‚Äì the number of defects in the product. * Schedule ‚Äì a measure of project progression, tracked against planned and actual completion dates. Applying standards to the process can ensure the data is precise and consistent. Data is logged in forms, normally using a PSP software tool. The SEI has developed a PSP tool and there are also open source options available, such as Process Dashboard. The key data collected in the PSP tool are time, defect, and size data ‚Äì the time spent in each phase; when and where defects were injected, found, and fixed; and the size of the product parts. Software developers use many other measures that are derived from these three basic measures to understand and improve their performance. Derived measures include: * estimation accuracy (size/time) * prediction intervals (size/time) * time in phase distribution * defect injection distribution * defect removal distribution * productivity * reuse percentage * cost performance index * planned value * earned value * predicted earned value * defect density * defect density by phase * defect removal rate by phase * defect removal leverage * review rates * process yield * phase yield * failure cost of quality (COQ) * appraisal COQ * appraisal/failure COQ ratio Planning and tracking Logging time, defect, and size data is an essential part of planning and tracking PSP projects, as historical data is used to improve estimating accuracy. The PSP uses the PROxy-Based Estimation (PROBE) method to improve a developer's estimating skills for more accurate project planning. For project tracking, the PSP uses the earned value method. The PSP also uses statistical techniques, such as correlation, linear regression, and standard deviation, to translate data into useful information for improving estimating, planning and quality. These statistical formulas are calculated by the PSP tool. Using the PSP The PSP is intended to help a developer improve their personal process; therefore PSP developers are expected to continue adapting the process to ensure it meets their personal needs. =PSP and the TSP= In practice, PSP skills are used in a TSP team environment. TSP teams consist of PSP-trained developers who volunteer for areas of project responsibility, so the project is managed by the team itself. Using personal data gathered using their PSP skills; the team makes the plans, the estimates, and controls the quality. Using PSP process methods can help TSP teams to meet their schedule commitments and produce high quality software. For example, according to research by Watts Humphrey, a third of all software projects fail,Humphrey, Watts S. \\"Why Big Software Projects Fail: The 12 Key Questions.\\" CrossTalk Mar. 2005 http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue- archives/2005/200503/200503-Humphrey.pdf but an SEI study on 20 TSP projects in 13 different organizations found that TSP teams missed their target schedules by an average of only six percent.Davis, Noopur, and Julia Mullaney. The Team Software Process SM (TSP SM) in Practice: A Summary of Recent Results. Pittsburgh, PA: Software Engineering Institute, Sept. 2003. Successfully meeting schedule commitments can be attributed to using historical data to make more accurate estimates, so projects are based on realistic plans ‚Äì and by using PSP quality methods, they produce low-defect software, which reduces time spent on removing defects in later phases, such as integration and acceptance testing. =PSP and other methodologies= The PSP is a personal process that can be adapted to suit the needs of the individual developer. It is not specific to any programming or design methodology; therefore it can be used with different methodologies, including Agile software development. Software engineering methods can be considered to vary from predictive through adaptive. The PSP is a predictive methodology, and Agile is considered adaptive, but despite their differences, the TSP/PSP and Agile share several concepts and approaches ‚Äì particularly in regard to team organization. They both enable the team to: * Define their goals and standards. * Estimate and schedule the work. * Determine realistic and attainable schedules. * Make plans and process improvements. Both Agile and the TSP/PSP share the idea of team members taking responsibility for their own work and working together to agree on a realistic plan, creating an environment of trust and accountability. However, the TSP/PSP differs from Agile in its emphasis on documenting the process and its use of data for predicting and defining project schedules. =Quality= High-quality software is the goal of the PSP, and quality is measured in terms of defects. For the PSP, a quality process should produce low-defect software that meets the user needs. The PSP phase structure enables PSP developers to catch defects early. By catching defects early, the PSP can reduce the amount of time spent in later phases, such as Test. The PSP theory is that it is more economical and effective to remove defects as close as possible to where and when they were injected, so software engineers are encouraged to conduct personal reviews for each phase of development. Therefore, the PSP phase structure includes two review phases: * Design Review * Code Review To do an effective review, you need to follow a structured review process. The PSP recommends using checklists to help developers to consistently follow an orderly procedure. The PSP follows the premise that when people make mistakes, their errors are usually predictable, so PSP developers can personalize their checklists to target their own common errors. Software engineers are also expected to complete process improvement proposals, to identify areas of weakness in their current performance that they should target for improvement. Historical project data, which exposes where time is spent and defects introduced, help developers to identify areas to improve. PSP developers are also expected to conduct personal reviews before their work undergoes a peer or team review. Certification A certification covering PSP is offered by the SEI at Carnegie Mellon University. The steps to becoming an SEI-Certified PSP Developer are: learn the PSP; take the certification exam; maintain credentials. The PSP Developer examination is based on concepts found in the PSP Body of Knowledge. Freely downloadable Special Report CMU/SEI-2009-SR-018, 2009 The SEI maintains an FAQ on certification.

This surname is derived from the Watanabe clan, a branch of the Minamoto clan, and refers to a location called 'Watanabe no tsu' which was settled by the Watanabe clan, who took the name of the place. It was located in the medieval period near the mouth of the Yodogawa River in Settsu Province, in present-day city of Osaka. mon) 'Mitsuboshi ni ichimonji' of the Watanabe clan. The keep of Hirado Castle. History =Origin= The first to be named Watanabe were the samurai clan founded by Watanabe no Tsuna (953-1025) of the Saga Genji branch of the Minamoto clan, and his official name was Minamoto no Tsuna. He was the son of Minamoto no Atsuru (933-953) married to a daughter of Minamoto no Mitsunaka, grandson of Minamoto no Mototsuko (891-942), great-grandson of Minamoto no Noboru (848-918), and great-great-grandson of Minamoto no T≈çru (822-895), son of the Emperor Saga (786-842), the 52nd Emperor of Japan. Tsuna established the Watanabe branch of the Minamoto clan, taking the name from his stronghold at Watanabe, a port on the Yodo River in Settsu Province, and in 1020 he was appointed Tango no kami (Governor of Tango Province). He was the maternal grandson of the Seiwa Genji and Chinjufu-sh≈çgun Minamoto no Mitsunaka (912-997), was companion in arms to his maternal uncle Minamoto no Yorimitsu (944‚Äì1021), and was famous for his military exploits in a number of tales and legends. He is known as one of the Four Guardian Kings (Shitenn≈ç) of Yorimitsu, referring to the Buddhist Four Heavenly Kings. =Late Heian period to the Genpei war= Watanabe no Den, great-grandson of Tsuna, received the hereditary title of Shokan (Governing officer) of the huge Oe no Mikuriya estate. Dominating Settsu Province as a focal area of maritime transportation in medieval Japan, the Watanabe family spread its influence widely. Their descendants settled in other areas, including Kyushu. Watanabe Hisashi (1064-1148 or 1154), also called Minamoto no Hisashi, great-grandson of Watanabe no Tsuna, was appointed Kebiishi (Chief of police and justice), was granted the title of Shokan (Governing officer) of Uno no Mikuriya estate in Matsuura (Hizen province) and called himself Matsuura Hisashi. He ruled Matsuura, the province of Iki, and a part of Sonogi district, and is the ancestor of the Matsuura Watanabe branch, lords of Hirado castle. During the H≈çgen rebellion (1156), and the Genpei War (1180‚Äì1185), the Watanabe sided with Minamoto no Yorimasa (1106‚Äì1180), until his death at the Battle of Uji, then with Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147‚Äì1199). At the Battle of Uji (1180), the opening battle of the Genpei War, the Watanabe clan formed with the warrior monks of Miidera Temple most of the Minamoto clan army. The Heike Monogatari describes some of the Watanabe samurai present at this battle : * Watanabe Choshichi Tonau : \\"He was attired that day in a samurai clothing of light green, and body armour ornamented with cherry blossoms on a yellow ground, and wore a sword with mounts of red copper; in his quiver he carried twenty four arrows feathered with white and under his arm was a bow lacquered in black and bound with red bands\\". * Watanabe no Kiou : \\"clad in a brocaded hunting suit profusely embroidered with chrysanthemums, and wearing a general's armour of scarlet; its name was Kisenaga, and it had been a treasured heirloom for many generations. On his head was a helmet shining with silver stars, and a splendid sword hung at his side. In his quiver were twenty four arrows barred with black on their white feathers, not to speak of the special arrow, feathered with a hawk's wing, always carried by the Imperial Guard of the Takiguchi. His bow was a 'shigeto' of black lacquer with red binding. He rode on (the horse named) Nanryo, while one of his retainers followed with a remount and another bore his shield under his arm\\". The Watanabe had a powerful navy, and in 1185 they sent their navy ships to support the Minamoto cause. At the Battle of Yashima (1185) their mounted samurai proved to be decisive. At the Battle of Dan-no-ura, when the Dowager Empress Kenrei-mon-In, daughter of Taira no Kiyomori, tried to drown herself, she was pulled out by the samurai Watanabe no Mutsuru. The priest Mongaku Sh≈çnin who urged Minamoto no Yoritomo to start a war against the Taira clan, and who managed to get a letter from the Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127‚Äì1192) to Yoritomo, requesting that he set up an army and liberate the country from the tyranny of the Taira, which enabled Yoritomo to take up arms, was the son of Watanabe no Endo Mochito. =Kamakura to Muromachi periods= After the Genpei war, the Matsuura Watanabe received the additional titles of Gokenin (Direct retainer) of the Bakufu, and of Jit≈ç (Territory steward). During the Mongol invasions (1274 and 1281), the Matsuura Watanabe fought fiercely to repel the invaders. Sashibo, the Soryo (Heir) and his cousin Yamashiro Kai, both from the Matsuura Watanabe, were killed in battle fighting against the Mongols. The Kamachi clan descended from Minamoto no Noboru (848-918) like their relatives of the Watanabe clan, and had the titles of Shokan (Governing officer] of Kanzaki no sh≈ç estate (Hizen province), of Gokenin (Direct retainer) of the Bakufu, and Jit≈ç (Territory steward) of Mizuna district (Chikugo province). Minamoto no Nao, from the Matsuura Watanabe, was 'Uhyoe no jo' (Officer of the guards of the Middle Palace), and owner of Mikuriya no sh≈ç estate. After the Jokyu war (1221), Nao's son, Minamoto no Sanen, was adopted by the Kamachi as their son in law to succeed their estates and titles; he changed his name to Kamachi, and was the founder of the Kamachi Watanabe branch, lords of Kamachi castle. At the time of the Mongol invasions, Kamachi Morohisa went to the front as a member of the Matsuura Watanabe clan. In 1235, the Watanabe clan received from the Kamakura shogunate the responsibility of overseeing large shipments of tax and tributes due the shogunate from the provinces of western and central Japan Watanabe Toru Watanabe Mochi, descendant of Tsuna, rendered distinguished military service to the Shogun Ashikaga Takauji (1305-1358), and was granted the title of Jit≈ç (Territory steward) of Yamada (Bingo Province). He is the ancestor of the Yamada Watanabe branch, who owned the whole area of Numakuma Peninsula, and were lords of Ichijoyama castle. In the ≈ånin War (1467-1477), they sided with the Eastern camp. They were treated by the Ashikaga as equal to a Shugo (Governor), and were allowed to use the Shirokasabukuro and Mosen kuraoi seals allowed only to the Shugo in the Muromachi period. =Sengoku period= Watanabe Moritsuna During the 16th century wars, the following Watanabe samurai distinguished themselves: * Watanabe Toru (‚Ä† 1543), also called Kayo, descendant of the Matsuura Watanabe, was a vassal of M≈çri Motonari, and was the son of Watanabe Suguru (‚Ä† 1524), lord of Nagamiyama castle. In 1543, at the Battle of Gassan-Toda, he was killed in a fierce battle in place of Motonari. After that the Mori clan continued to give important posts to the Watanabe clan, and the Watanabe family members were honored at the head of the Choshu Domain's New Year's Kacchu-kaiki ceremony for generations. * Watanabe Hajime (1534-1612) of the Mori clan, son of Watanabe Toru, fought at the Battle of Kanbe (1548), against the Hiraga clan of Takayatozaki castle (1551), against the Miya clan of Takiyama castle (1552), at Miyajima (1555) and Moji (1561). In 1586, he took part in the invasion of Kyushu, and in 1588, he went to Kyoto with Mori Terumoto, and received from Toyotomi Hideyoshi the title of Hida no kami (Governor of Hida Province). He is listed as one of the eighteen Generals of the Mori. * Watanabe Tadasu (‚Ä† 1615) was a descendant of the Matsuura Watanabe, and a retainer of the Toyotomi clan, . He took a part in the Battle of D≈çmy≈çji (1615), in the Battle of Tenn≈çji (1615), and died at the fall of Osaka castle (1615). * The Matsuura Watanabe of Izumi, were Shugodai (vice- Governors) of Izumi province and lords of Kishiwada castle. At the battle of Sekigahara, they sided against the Tokugawa and were deprived of their fief. * Watanabe Motoharu, of the Yamada Watanabe branch, lord of Ichijoyama castle, was a direct retainer of the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki (1537-1597). At the Battle of Sekigahara, he fought against Tokugawa Ieyasu. After that his family became retainers of the Mizuno clan. * Watanabe Moritsuna (1542‚Äì1620), descended from the Matsuura Watanabe, through Watanabe Yasushi, grandson of Matsuura Hisashi, great-grandson of Watanabe no Tsuna. His ancestors were direct retainers of the Ashikaga Shoguns, and later moved to Mikawa province, thence they were called the Mikawa Watanabe branch. He joined Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1557, and fought at the battles of Anegawa (1570), Mikatagahara (1573), Nagashino (1575), Komaki and Nagakute (1584), and the Siege of Osaka (1614-1615). In 1613, he had a revenue of 14,000 koku, and was lord of Terabe castle. He is the ancestor of the Watanabe of Hakata Domain and the Hanzo Watanabe branch, and is listed as one of the sixteen Generals of the Tokugawa. =Edo period to the Meiji Restoration= Watanabe Sadatsuna (1668-1715), fifth head of the Hanzo Watanabe, Kar≈ç (Chief retainer) of the Tokugawa of Owari Domain, lord of Terabe and Hida no Kami (Governor of Hida province) Besides the mainstream of Watanabe, the Matsuura branch, Daimy≈ç of Hirado Domain (Hizen Province) until 1868, were the most famous and flourished branch, and had a revenue of 61,700 koku. The Matsuura Watanabe of Hirado Shinden, Daimy≈ç of Hirado Shinden Domain (Hizen Province) until 1868, descending from the fourth lord of Hirado, was given 10,000 koku, and established a branch domain. The Watanabe of Hakata, were Daimy≈ç of Hakata Domain (Izumi Province) until the Meiji Restoration (1868), had a revenue of 13,500 koku, and descend from Watanabe Yoshitsuna (1611-1668), grandson of Moritsuna. The Hanzo Watanabe branch, descending from Watanabe Shigetsuna (1574-1648), son of Moritsuna, were lords of Terabe estate, Hida no Kami (Governors of Hida province), senior retainers of the Tokugawa of Owari Domain, and had a revenue of 10,000 koku. After 1868, they were raised to the Peerage. The Watanabe of ≈åmura (Hizen Province) were ranked among the Peers after 1868. The Watanabe of Suwa (Shinano Province) were also raised to the Peerage after 1868. Several Watanabe were Hatamoto (Direct retainers 'Guardians of the banner') and high ranking samurai of the Tokugawa Shoguns and their principal branches, like the descendants of : * Watanabe Terutsuna, Noto no Kami (Governor of Noto province), and Hatamoto with a revenue of 6,000 koku. * Watanabe Zonosuke, a Taishin (high) Hatamoto. * Watanabe Tozutsuna, Kar≈ç (Chief retainer) of the Tayasu Tokugawa, and of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa. * Watanabe Naotsuna, Wakasa no Kami (Governor of Wakasa province), senior retainer of the Tokugawa of Kish≈´ Domain, had a revenue of 8,000 koku.

The surname Watanabe is a toponymic surname (and not an occupational surname), and refers to a location called 'Watanabe no tsu', and was located between Tenmabashi Station and Tenjinbashi Station, in the present day Osaka City. Watanabe no Tsuna took charge of Zama jinja Temple, also called Ikasuri jinja. The hereditary Guji (Chief Priest) of the temple were descending from Watanabe Kaoru, descendant of Watanabe no Tsuna. The original site of the shrine was different from the current one, and the main hall was in the place where Watanabe no tsu used to be. Toyotomi Hideyoshi relocated to its current location near Nishiyokoborikawa River, at the address 3 Watanabe, 4-chome Watanabe, Kyutaromachi, Chuo Ward, Osaka City. It is the fifth most common Japanese surname. In the context of the Japanese economy, Mrs. Watanabe is a generic name for housewives who deal in foreign exchange.

The NWCF is a revolving fund, an account or fund that relies on sales revenue rather than direct Congressional appropriations to finance its operations. It is intended to generate adequate revenue to cover the full costs of its operations, and to finance the fund's continuing operations without fiscal year limitation. A revolving fund is intended to operate on a break-even basis over time; that is, it neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss. United States Navy activities financed through the NWCF perform a wide variety of functions including Supply Management, Depot Maintenance, Research and Development, Transportation, and Base Support. The NWCF continues to pursue some important efforts to improve efficiency and maximize effectiveness. Success in these endeavors is critical to ensuring that the Department of the Navy can afford both the ongoing support costs of fleet operations and the necessary reinvestment in new platforms and weapons systems. History of the NWCF Historically, the U.S. military has had two categories of revolving funds; stock funds and industrial funds. Stock funds, in use by the Navy since the 1870s, were aimed at financing the procurement of material (spare parts and other items) in volume from commercial sources, to be held in inventory. This material was intended to be sold to customers, in order to achieve weapon systems readiness or to provide personnel support. Industrial funds, in use by the Navy since the 1940s, provided industrial and commercial goods and services such as depot maintenance, transportation, and research and development. The 1949 amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 authorized the United States Secretary of Defense to establish revolving funds as the business model for the operation of these funds. In 1991, all of DoD's stock and industrial funds were rolled into a single revolving fund, the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF), along with five additional defense commercial operations or business areas previously funded with direct appropriations. DBOF was capitalized at a level significantly less than the sum of the stock and industrial funds it replaced. The consolidation of stock and industrial funds caused overall cash levels to be reduced, by allowing funds or capital to be shared across all of the activities, resulting in cash flow problems. The Defense Authorization Act addressed this issue, requiring that DoD conduct a comprehensive study of DBOF and present its findings along with a proposed improvement plan to Congress for approval. In December 1996, DBOF was reorganized into four working capital funds (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense-Wide). With the addition of a fifth fund‚Äîthe Defense Commissary Agency in 1999‚Äîthe new organization was now officially called the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). The five funds and their corresponding business areas provide goods and services to DoD and authorized non-DoD activities. DWCF and NWCF operations The support functions financed through the NWCF, as part of the DWCF, are grouped together at the DWCF level into business areas that are managed within DoD. Business areas receive their initial working capital through an appropriation or transfer of resources from an existing revolving fund. This working capital is called the \\"corpus\\" and is used to finance the initial costs of goods and services. Resources to replenish the corpus are generated by acceptance of customer orders. Customer orders are obligations on the appropriations of the ordering activity. The business area delivers the goods or services ordered using the funds in the corpus, and then bills the customer based on the rates set for those goods and services. The fund is replenished when the customer pays the bill to the fund. Customer orders accepted by the NWCF activities must be either obligations of a federal government activity or cash advances from non-federal government customers. The acceptance of a customer order creates a quasi-contractual relationship between the NWCF activity and its customer. The customers of each NWCF activity are responsible for budgeting for and budgetary control of the cost of end products and services ordered from the NWCF activity. The customer cannot use its appropriated funds to do indirectly (through the NWCF activity) what it is not permitted to do directly. The availability of an appropriation cannot be expanded or otherwise changed by transfer to the NWCF. The customer bears the primary responsibility for the determination of the applicability of its appropriated funds in the orders placed with the NWCF activity. =Stabilized billing rates= One of the features of the NWCF that allows its customers to accurately plan and budget their appropriated funds for NWCF support requirements is the rate stabilization policy adopted by the NWCF. For each budget year, the NWCF establishes customer rates on an end product basis whenever feasible. These rates are set at levels estimated to recover the cost of products or services to be provided. This stabilized rate policy protects appropriated fund customers from unforeseen cost changes, and also minimizes fluctuations in planned NWCF work levels, permitting a more effective use of NWCF resources. In conjunction with the stabilized rate policy, the NWCF uses a cost recovery, or breakeven policy. With stabilized rates, gains or losses in operations may occur as a result of variations in program execution. To maintain full cost recovery and thereby to break even over the long term, NWCF activities generally adjust their rates each year to reflect such realized gains and losses. NWCF requirements To be included in the NWCF financial structure, a proposed business area must meet four criteria: # Outputs (i.e., goods produced and services provided) can be identified; #An approved accounting system is available; #Organizations (i.e., customers) that require and order products or services have been identified; #Advantages and disadvantages of establishing a buyer/seller relationship have been evaluated. Revolving funds The funding of the NWCF is based on a revolving-fund concept of operations, under which the NWCF activities received their initial working capital through an appropriation or through a transfer of resources from existing appropriations of funds and used those resources to finance the initial cost of products and services. Financial resources to replenish the initial working capital and to permit continuing operations are generated by the acceptance of customer orders. Revolving funds operate in a fashion similar to a personal checking account. An individual deposits income into their account. In order to maintain themselves as a \\"continuing operation,\\" necessary goods and services must be purchased, reducing the fund total. In order to keep the fund balanced, expenditures must not exceed income. By keeping a positive account balance, and by looking for ways to stretch capital further, revolving fund activities are exercising sound financial management. A revolving fund gets its name from the cyclic nature of the cash flow. Income from customer purchases is used to finance a service providers' continuing operations, i.e., the business areas in a working capital fund sell goods or services with the intent of recovering the total cost incurred in providing those goods and services. Income from sales is then used to buy or replace inventory and finance the production of future goods and services. NWCF funding process summary # Congress provides a one-time cash corpus to begin operation and in advance of customer orders. # Customers receive appropriations from Congress. # The customer sends a work order or project order to the working capital fund business area provider. # The business area furnishes the service or product, pays for expenses incurred, and bills the customer. # The customer pays the bill. # The business area incurs either a loss or a profit during the fiscal year, resulting in either an increase in the rate charged to the customer or a rebate (lowered rate) charged to the customer.

Occasionally used as a gemstone, phenakite occurs as isolated crystals, which are rhombohedral with parallel-faced hemihedrism, and are either lenticular or prismatic in habit: the lenticular habit is determined by the development of faces of several obtuse rhombohedra and the absence of prism faces. There is no cleavage, and the fracture is conchoidal. The Mohs hardness is high, being 7.5 ‚Äì 8; the specific gravity is 2.96. The crystals are sometimes perfectly colorless and transparent, but more often they are greyish or yellowish and only translucent; occasionally they are pale rose-red. In general appearance the mineral is not unlike quartz, for which indeed it has been mistaken. Its name comes from , meaning \\"deceiver\\" due to its close visual similarity to quartz,Firefly Guide to Gems By Cally Oldershaw p.94 named by Nils Gustaf Nordenski√∂ld in 1833. Occurrence Phenakite crystal from the Noumas II Pegmatite, South Africa. (Size:1.2x0.5x0.4cm) Crystal structure of Phenakite viewed along the c axis Phenakite is found in high-temperature pegmatite veins and in mica-schists associated with quartz, chrysoberyl, apatite and topaz. It has long been known from the emerald and chrysoberyl mine on the Takovaya stream, near Yekaterinburg in the Urals of Russia, where large crystals occur in mica- schist. It is also found with topaz and amazon-stone in the granite of the Ilmen Mountains in the southern Urals and of the Pikes Peak region in Colorado (US). Small, gem grade individual crystals of phenakite showing a prismatic habit are noted in beryl dissolution cavities at the Noumas II Pegmatite, part of the Orange River pegmatite belt in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Large crystals of prismatic habit have been found in a feldspar quarry at Krager√∏ in Norway. Framont near Schirmeck in Alsace is another well-known locality. Still larger crystals, measuring in diameter and weighing . have been found at Greenwood in Maine, but these are pseudomorphs of quartz after phenakite. For gem purposes the stone is cut in the brilliant form, of which there are two fine examples, weighing 34 and 43 carats (6.8 and 8.6 g), in the British Museum. The indices of refraction are higher than those of quartz, beryl or topaz; a faceted phenakite is consequently rather brilliant and may sometimes be mistaken for diamond.

The 737 then continued on to Rabat, Morocco, and Guantanamo Bay, the Marty Report said. In 2004 the plane was used to render LIFG leader Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Bouchar to Libya. \\"The registered owners of both planes [Boeing 737, N313P, and Gulfstream V, N379P] appear to be CIA front companies.

N379P N379P was a tailnumber assigned to a Gulfstream V executive jet. The aircraft has been reported in several press sources as a U.S. Department of Defense prisoner transport, also known as \\"Guant√°namo Bay Express\\". The craft has been reported to being used to transport suspected terrorists to undisclosed locations for either extraordinary rendition or into the CIA prison system. It has been the subject of criminal complaints\\"Criminal Complaint\\", Statewatch and parliamentary inquiries.\\"Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised)\\", Irish Government Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, December 20, 2005 According to an in-depth investigation into the worldwide network of detention and interrogation facilities employed in the War on Terror, by the British Guardian newspaper, (March 2005):\\"One Huge US Jail\\", The Guardian, March 19, 2005 =Background= The first media mention of N379P was six weeks after September 11, 2001, when, according to the Chicago Tribune, a Pakistani newspaper reported that a student at the University of Karachi and a citizen of Yemen, had been seen being forced onto the plane at Jinnah International Airport by Pakistani security officers on the morning of October 23, 2001. The Chicago Tribune reported on the aircraft again on February 6, 2007, stating that N379P departed Washington Dulles International Airport July 27, 2003, and flew to Frankfurt, Germany according to FAA records. The FAA then records the Gulfstream taking off from Tashkent, Uzbekistan on July 31, 2003, bound for Glasgow, Scotland, and then return to Dulles. The Tribune then states that Polish aviation records indicate that N379P landed at Szczytno-Szymany International Airport, a remote airfield at Szymany, Poland, at 2:58 a.m. on July 30, 2003, after a flight from Afghanistan. How the aircraft moved from Frankfurt to Tashkent remains unreported. The Szymany airport is located southwest of the Stare Kiejkuty intelligence base in northern Poland. The executive jet with the tail number N379P was again brought to public attention by Swedish TV4's documentary, Det brutna l√∂ftet (\\"The broken promise\\"), aired May 17, 2004. The documentary claimed that the expulsion of two men, Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery‚Äîordered by the Cabinet‚Äîto Egypt on December 18, 2001, was carried out by hooded U.S. agents. The plane booked by the Swedish Security Police (S√ÑPO) was cancelled when another plane arrived‚ÄîN379P‚Äîa Gulfstream V executive jet supplied by the firm (Premier Executive Transport Services, Inc.) which works exclusively for the U.S. Defense Department. Agiza and al-Zery were arrested and brought to Bromma airport in Stockholm where Swedish police handed them over to hooded operatives. The two prisoners had their clothes cut from their bodies by scissors, without their hand- and footcuffs being loosened. The naked and chained prisoners were given suppository of unknown kind inserted into their anus, and diapers were put on them. They were forcibly dressed in dark overalls. Their hands and feet are chained to a specially designed harness. On the plane, both men are blindfolded and hooded. The plane took off at 21.49 and set course towards Egypt. Later on, when the Gulfstream's log books came into a journalist's hands, the wider scope became clear:Not In Our Name.net = Appearance in fiction = N379P appears in the episode \\"Hundrede dage\\" of the Danish TV series Borgen which focuses on the problems for the Danish prime-minister caused by the revelation of rendition flights landing at Thule.

By the early 1960s, Synanon became an alternative community centered on group truth- telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game\\". Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s. Synanon disbanded in 1991The Cult That Spawned the Tough-Love Teen Industry. , Mother Jones, September/October 2007. due to members being convicted of criminal activities (including attempted murder) and retroactive loss of its tax-free status with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence, and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen\\". Beginnings Charles Dederich, a reformed alcoholic, cult leader, and member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), was said to be an admired speaker at A.A. meetings. Those suffering from addictions to illegal drugs were not always welcomed into AA because it was considered that their addiction issues were significantly different from those suffered by alcoholics. Dederich, after taking LSD, decided to create his own program to respond to their needs.

Sociological Analysis 41.2 (1980): 109-27. Web. Synanon is a word of his own invention integrating togetherness (‚Äúsyn‚Äù) with the unknown (‚Äúanon‚Äù). Synanon began as a two-year residential program, but Dederich soon concluded that its members could never graduate, because a full recovery was impossible. The program was based on testimony of fellow group members about their tribulations and urges of relapsing, and their journeys to recovery. Synanon differed from Alcoholics Anonymous in that it was directed toward both drug-users and drinkers. The Synanon organization also developed a business that sold promotional items. This became a successful enterprise that for a time generated roughly $10 million per year. In 1959, Synanon moved from their small storefront to an armory on the beach. In the early 1960s Charles was able to utilize the media and his Hollywood associates to promote his organization. In 1967, Synanon purchased the Club Casa del Mar, a large beachside hotel in Santa Monica, and this was used as its headquarters and as a dormitory for those undergoing treatment for drug addiction. Later on, Synanon acquired a large building that had been the home of the Athens Athletic Club, in Oakland, California, and then transformed it into a residential facility for Synanon's members.Janzen, Rod A. The Rise and Fall of Synanon: A California Utopia. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2001. Print. Outsiders were permitted to attend the \\"Synanon Game\\" there as well. Children were reared communally in the Synanon School. Juveniles in the justice system were often ordered to enroll in Synanon by California's courts. Professionals, even those without drug addictions, were invited to join Synanon. The New York psychiatrist Daniel Casriel M.D., founder of AREBA (today the oldest surviving private addiction treatment centre in the United States) and cofounder of Daytop Village (one of the world's largest therapeutic communities) visited in 1962, lived there in 1963 and wrote a book about his experiences.\\"So Fair A House: The story of Synanon\\", New York: Prentice-Hall. 1963. Control over members occurred through the \\"Game\\". The \\"Game\\" was presented as a therapeutic tool, and likened to a form of group therapy; but it has been criticized as a form of a \\"social control\\", in which members humiliated one another and encouraged the exposure of one another's innermost weaknesses.Where did it come from?, Synanon Church and the medical basis for the $traights, or Hoopla in Lake Havasu, by Wes Fager, 2000.

Robert Altman hired members of Synanon to be extras for the gambling scenes in his movie California Split. Practices Entrance into the Synanon community required a strong initial commitment. Newcomers were first interviewed by Synanon leadership to gain entrance into the community. Upon their arrival, those newcomers were forced to quit using drugs cold turkey, going through withdrawal for the first few days in the program.Sternberg, David. \\"Synanon House‚ÄîA Consideration for Its Implications on American Correction\\". Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science 54.4 (1963): n. pag. Print. Furthermore, for their first ninety days in the community, members were expected to cease contact with outside friends and family. During its first decade, Synanon members entered into a 1‚Äì2-year program in three stages aimed at preparing members to reenter greater society. During the first stage, members did community and housekeeping labor. During the second stage, members worked outside of the community but still resided within the community. Finally, during the third stage, members both worked and lived outside of the community, but still attended regular meetings. After Synanon's transition into an alternate society in 1968, this program changed to a \\"lifetime rehabilitation\\" program, with the premise that drug addicts would never truly be well enough to return to society. One of the most distinguishing practices of the Synanon community was a therapeutic practice commonly referred to as \\"The Game.\\" The game was a session during which one member would talk about themselves and then endure intense criticism by their peers.\\"Synanon: Toward Building a Humanistic Organization\\". Journal of Humanistic Psychology 18.3 (1978): 3‚Äì20. Web. During this practice, members were encouraged to be critical of everything, using harsh and profane language. However, despite the very aggressive nature of The Game, outside of The Game, members were required to act civilly to each other. While in The Game, members criticized each other, but left as friends and supportive community members. The Game served not only as Synanon's most prominent form of therapy and personal change, but also worked as a way for leaders to collect the opinions of community members. Because there was no hierarchy in The Game, members could freely criticize Synanon's highest leadership, who would then take member concerns into consideration when deciding policy. The game turned into a 72-hour version and was admitted by Dederich to be brainwashing. The game was eventually used to pressure people to submit to Dederich's will, abort pregnancies, undergo vasectomies, and commit violence. Dederich eventually changed his way of thinking about Synanon and transformed it into something resembling a human progressive group. Synanon moved to create schooling for members, and Dederich wanted members to mentally change in order to improve society on the outside. The school was headed by Al Bauman, who believed in an innovative philosophy and aimed to teach children in the same manner to think differently. The school attracted lawyers, screenwriters, and business executives, all wanting to educate their children in a progressive environment. Lifetime rehabilitation concept Beginning in 1964, , PDF of FBI file at governmentattic.org. the legal authorities began to investigate Synanon's practices. The concept of \\"lifetime rehabilitation\\" did not agree with therapeutic norms, and it was alleged that the Synanon group was running an unauthorized medical clinic. Synanon expanded an old Trans-Pacific Marconi RCA radio station in Tomales Bay now Marconi Conference Center State Historical Park. It was alleged that on remote properties in California such as at Marshall in Marin County and in Badger, Tulare County, Synanon had erected buildings without the legally-required permits, had created a trash dump, and built an airstrip. Taxation issues also arose. In response to these accusations, Dederich declared that Synanon was a tax exempt religious organization, the \\"Church of Synanon\\". Legal problems continued, despite this change. Children who had been assigned to Synanon began running away, and an \\"underground railroad\\" had been created in the area that sought to help them return to their parents. Beatings of Synanon's opponents and its ex-members, \\"splittees\\", occurred across California. Beatings occurred in Synanon basements. A state Grand Jury in Marin County issued a scathing report in 1978 that attacked Synanon for the very strong evidence of its child abuse, and also for the monetary profits that flowed to Dederich. The Grand Jury report also rebuked the governmental authorities involved for their lack of oversight, although it stopped short of directly interceding in the Synanon situation. Though many San Francisco area newspapers and broadcasters covered the Synanon case, they were largely silenced by legal action from Synanon's lawyers, who made claims of libel. These lawsuits ultimately turned out to be a large part of Synanon's undoing, by giving journalists access to Synanon's own internal documents.  Criminal activity and collapse  Synanon is purported to have been involved in several criminal activities, such as the disappearance of Rose Lena Cole in late 1972, or early 1973. Cole had received a court order to enroll in Synanon before she disappeared. She has not been seen or heard from since. Rose Cole's entry on The Charley Project. , accessed 20 May 2009 Initially Synanon did not support violence; Dederich later changed the rules to allow for violence in order to maintain control. Much of the violence by Synanon had been carried out by a group within Synanon called the \\"Imperial Marines\\". Over 80 violent acts were committed including mass beatings that hospitalized teenagers and ranchers who were beaten in front of their families. People who left the organization were at risk of physical violence for being a \\"splittee\\"; one ex-member, Phil Ritter, was beaten so severely that his skull was fractured and he subsequently fell into a coma with a near-fatal case of bacterial meningitis. In mid-1978, the NBC Nightly News produced a news segment on the controversies surrounding Synanon. Following this broadcast, several executives of the NBC network and its corporate chairman allegedly received hundreds of threats from Synanon members and supporters.Jack Anderson, \\"NBC Cancelled Jonestown Story\\", March 20, 1981. NBC continued with a series of reports on the Synanon situation on the NBC Nightly News. The Point Reyes Light, a small-circulation weekly newspaper in Marin County, would later receive the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their covering Synanon at a time when other news agencies avoided reporting. Several weeks after NBC began receiving threats, on October 10, 1978, two Synanon members placed a de-rattled rattlesnake in the mailbox of attorney Paul Morantz of Pacific Palisades, California.Janzen, Rod A. The Rise and Fall of Synanon, A California Utopia, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, p. 214. Morantz had successfully brought suit on behalf of people who were being held against their will by Synanon. The snake bit him, and he was hospitalized for six days. This incident, along with the press coverage, prompted an investigation by the police and government into Synanon. Six weeks later, the Los Angeles Police Department performed a search of the ranch in Badger that found a recorded speech by Dederich in which he said, \\"We're not going to mess with the old-time, turn-the-other-cheek religious postures... Our religious posture is: Don't mess with us. You can get killed dead, literally dead... These are real threats\\", he snarled. \\"They are draining life's blood from us, and expecting us to play by their silly rules. We will make the rules. I see nothing frightening about it... I am quite willing to break some lawyer's legs, and next break his wife's legs, and threaten to cut their child's arm off. That is the end of that lawyer. That is a very satisfactory, humane way of transmitting information. I really do want an ear in a glass of alcohol on my desk.\\"Light to celebrate 25th anniversary of its Pulitzer, The Point Reyes Light, April 15, 2004, By Dave Mitchell. During the investigations researchers also came across multiple lawsuits and arrests against Synanon members. Dederich was arrested while drunk on December 2, 1978. The two other Synanon residents, Joe Musico and Lance Kenton, the son of the musician Stan Kenton, pleaded \\"no contest\\" to charges of assault, and also conspiracy to commit murder. Lance Kenton was sentenced to a year in prison. While his associates went to jail, Dederich received probation because his doctors claimed that due to ill health he would most likely die in prison. As a condition of probation, he was disallowed from taking part in managing Synanon. Synanon struggled to survive without its leader, and also with a severely tarnished reputation. The Internal Revenue Service revoked the organization's tax-exempt status and ordered them to pay $17 million in back taxes. This bankrupted Synanon, which formally dissolved in 1991.Szalavitz, Maia, Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids, Riverhead Books, 2006, p. 33.  Synanon's influence in the behavior-modification field  Mel Wasserman, influenced by his Synanon experience, founded CEDU Education. CEDU's schools used the confrontation model of Synanon. Ever unconventional, long controversial , By Keith Chu, The Bend Bulletin, November 15, 2009 The CEDU model was widely influential on the development of parent-choice, private-pay residential programs. People originally inspired by their CEDU experience developed or strongly influenced a significant number of the schools in the therapeutic boarding school industry. Father William B. O'Brien, the founder of New York's Daytop Village, included Synanon's group encounters and confrontational approach in his research into addiction treatment methods. Daytop History , Daytop Homepage, retrieved 3/25/2010 The author, journalist and activist Maia Szalavitz claims to chart the influence of Synanon in other programs including Phoenix House, Straight, Incorporated and Boot Camps in addition to those mentioned above. Successes Despite its controversies and its downfall, the Synanon program is credited with curing some people of their addictions. For example, Synanon was credited with curing, at least temporarily, the heroin-addicted jazz musicians Frank Rehak, Arnold Ross, Joe Pass, and Art Pepper (Pepper discussed his Synanon experiences at length in his autobiography Straight Life), and the actor Matthew Beard. In 1962, Pass formed a band composed of Synanon patients who recorded an album titled Sounds of Synanon. The Synanon organization was praised by the motivational speaker Florrie Fisher in her speeches to high school students, and she credited Synanon with curing her of her heroin addiction. Synanon also inspired the creation of successful programs such as the Delancey Street Foundation, co-founded by John Maher, a former Synanon member. Many former members still value what they see as the positive aspects of Synanon, primarily its strong sense of community, and remain in close contact, in person or through on-line chat groups, and have gone into business together. A branch of Synanon that was founded in Germany in 1971 is still in operation. Popular depictions The 1965 Columbia Pictures movie Synanon, directed by Richard Quine, was set at (and filmed in) Synanon; it starred Edmond O'Brien as Chuck Dederich, as well as Chuck Connors, Stella Stevens, Richard Conte, and Eartha Kitt. The 1968 season 1, episode 22 of Mannix features Synanon. Synanon is referred to in Bob Dylan's song \\"Lenny Bruce\\", from his album Shot of Love (Bruce \\"never made it to Synanon\\"). It is also referred to in the song \\"Opening Doors\\" from Stephen Sondheim's musical Merrily We Roll Along, which mentions it as a hypothetical song title in a satirical revue of the 1960s. The 1993 science fiction TV series Babylon 5 included a version of the Synanon Game in the episodes \\"Signs and Portents\\" and \\"Comes the Inquisitor\\". The \\"New-Path\\" drug treatment centers in science fiction writer Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel A Scanner Darkly bear numerous similarities to Synanon. Dick's 1981 novel VALIS begins with the initial romantic interest jumping off the tenth floor of the Synanon building in Oakland, California. In Charles Alverson's 1977 novel Not Sleeping, Just Dead, private eye Joe Goodey attempts to solve a suspected murder at The Institute, an organization that bears more than a passing resemblance to Synanon. (Alverson had lived in Synanon for six months in 1967 as a straight, or non- addicted, resident.) Synanon is mentioned in Joan Didion's 1979 essay The White Album. Deborah Swisher, a former Synanon member, recounts her experiences growing up in several Synanon communes in her one-woman show Hundreds of Sisters and One Big Brother. Hollywood Park: A Memoir, by Mikel Jollett (founder of The Airborne Toxic Event) was published in May 2020 and describes Jollett's life in, and escape from Synanon.

Early life and ministry Phipps trained as a lawyer but in 1968, he felt called to ordained ministry. He studied theology at Chicago's McCormick Theological Seminary and was ordained in 1969. From 1974 to 1983, he was minister at Trinity-St. Paul's United Church in Toronto. He then moved to Alberta to work in church administration. Moderator of the United Church of Canada Phipps was elected to the post of Moderator at the 36th General Council of the United Church in August 1997. Only a short time after his installation, he ignited widespread controversy inside and outside the church when, in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen editorial board, he questioned the resurrection of Jesus as a scientific fact, said he was undecided on the question of the afterlife, and \\"I don't believe Jesus was God.\\" In October 1998, speaking on behalf of the United Church, Phipps apologized on behalf of the United Church to Canada's indigenous First Nations for abuse in church-run residential schools earlier in the century, saying in part, \\"To those individuals who were physically, sexually, and mentally abused as students of the Indian Residential Schools in which The United Church of Canada was involved, I offer you our most sincere apology. You did nothing wrong. You were and are the victims of evil acts that cannot under any circumstances be justified or excused.\\" Later career Following his time as moderator, Phipps was a community organizer, hospital chaplain and adult educator, and from 1993 until his retirement in 2007, he was minister at Scarboro United Church in Calgary. In 2002, Phipps was the New Democratic Party candidate in the Calgary Southwest by-election contested by newly elected Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper. Phipps challenged Harper's conservative economic and social views. During the campaign, Harper commented that he \\"despise[d]\\" Phipps,< and declined to participate in debates with him. In the election, Phipps came in second with just over 20 per cent of the vote.

History Johann Caspar Richter was a Saxon landowner and shipper-trader originally from Germany. He moved to a supposed German village of Kronenschieldt (sometimes spelled Cronenschieldt), near Leipzig, during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) and married Maria Hahn, from Annaburg in Saxony- Anhalt. His illegitimate son, Johannes Caspar Richter von Kronenschieldt, was born in Leipzig circa 1661 and occupied the village's name as part of his surname, together with an entirely spurious and canting coat of arms. After being educated briefly at the University of Leipzig, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts in about 1688. He anglicized his name to \\"John Caspar Crowninshield\\" and married Elizabeth Allen on December 5, 1694 in Lynn, Massachusetts, and bought the land near Spring Pond. Their children began the Crowninshield family known today. He died December 19, 1711. His great- granddaughter Mary Crowinshield (1778‚Äì1835) was the wife of Senator Nathaniel Silsbee, whose son-in-law was Jared Sparks. Influence in America =Seafaring= Shortly after moving to Essex County, Massachusetts, and especially the town of Salem, the Crowninshields began to make their impact on American seafaring. They helped settle Salem and led it to seafaring prominence, helping turn it into an important seaport as well as a settlement for affluent families by the late 18th century. George Crowninshield (1733‚Äì1815) founded the Crowninshield & Sons shipping business with his five sons. 1818 painting of Cleopatra's Barge by George Ropes, Jr. in Peabody Essex Museum George Crowninshield Jr. [1766-1817] sketch, circa 1813 In Salem, the family built Crowninshield's Wharf, one of three major town wharfs at the time. As a result, the Crowninshields became highly influential in the international trade in tea (including Bohea from as far as China), cod, molasses, Madeira wine, Valencia oranges, M√°laga grapes, salt, iron, and other goods. The family was responsible for starting the first major pepper sea trade. The earlier pepper trade between Asia and Europe had been land-based. Crowninshield's Wharf. This painting by George Ropes, Jr. is in the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. Lieutenant Benjamin Crowninshield (b. 1757) served from 17 October 1778 on the American privateer Black Prince during the American Revolution, threedecks.org: American Privateer ship Black Prince (1778) which raided Fishguard and disrupted British merchant shipping. He was a son of Jacob Crowninshield (1732‚Äì1774) and Hannah Carlton (1734‚Äì1824). A son of George Crowninshield (b. 1733), sea adventurer George Crowninshield Jr. (1766‚Äì1817) built and sailed the yacht Cleopatra's Barge, named after the ancient ship used by Cleopatra VII. It became the first yacht to cross the Atlantic Ocean. =Government and military= Photo of Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott Although the family's prominence was originally gained via seafaring, Crowninshields later became most noted for the public service, primarily in politics and the military. The early Crowninshields were Republicans and were noted for their strong support of Thomas Jefferson. The Crowninshields were particularly praised for their naval leadership. Benjamin Williams Crowninshield was United States Secretary of the Navy under both James Madison and James Monroe, while his great-great-grandson Charles Francis Adams III, also a noted yachtsman, was secretary under Herbert Hoover. Former U.S. Representative Jacob Crowninshield was appointed to be the second person to hold the position by Thomas Jefferson, but did not serve due to his ill health. His grandson Arent S. Crowninshield served as an admiral in the United States Navy and later as chief of the Navy's Bureau of Navigation during the McKinley Administration. William Crowninshield Endicott was United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland's first term as President of the United States. Caspar F. Crowninshield served as a Union Army captain and brevet brigadier general during the American Civil War, while Charles Francis Adams, Jr., great-grandson of Benjamin Williams Crowninshield, served as a general. Since the late 19th century, the family's political influence has been exercised primarily at the state and local levels, including in Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York, where multiple branches of the family settled, as well as in Massachusetts. =The arts and publishing= During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the Crowninshields were mostly visible in the arts and publishing. Frank Crowninshield created and edited Vanity Fair magazine, while Francis Boardman Crowninshield became an accomplished painter and architect. Stained-glass artist Frederic Crowninshield (1845‚Äì1918) was an instructor at the Museum of Fine Arts School of Drawing and Painting in Boston. Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee was the executive editor of The Washington Post during the publication of the Pentagon Papers and played a pivotal role in the newspaper's coverage of the Watergate scandal. He stepped down as executive editor and became a member of the editorial board and vice president at large in 1991. =Other contributions= The Crowninshields were responsible for bringing the first elephant to the U.S. The elephant arrived on April 12, 1796, brought by Jacob Crowninshield, who had purchased it in India. The two- year-old elephant was brought into New York City, costing Crowninshield a total of $450. It later toured the country extensively after Crowninshield sold it for $10,000. Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield, wife of Francis Boardman Crowninshield, is known as one of America's first major historical preservationists and was a founding member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Charles Francis Adams IV, great-great-great-grandson of Benjamin Williams Crowninshield and the son of Charles Francis Adams III, was the first president and later chairman of the Raytheon Company. Brahmin life =Marriages= The Crowninshields, like other Boston Brahmin families, often married into other noted families. Frances (Fanny) Cadwalader Crowninshield, daughter of George and Harriet Sears Crowninshield, married John Quincy Adams II, son of Charles Francis Adams, grandson of president John Quincy Adams and great grandson of president John Adams. William Crowninshield Endicott was a direct descendant of John Endecott, the first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Fellow Salem resident Nathaniel Hawthorne's father, Captain Nathaniel Hathorne, Sr., sailed ships owned by the Crowninshields, who were his in-laws. The Crowninshields were also intermarried with the Derby and Pickman families of Salem, two other dynastic families of merchants. George Crowninshield married Mary Derby, sister of Elias Hasket Derby, who married Elizabeth Crowninshield, George Crowninshield's sister, in 1761. Anstiss Derby, Elias Hasket's daughter by his Crowninshield wife, Derby married merchant Benjamin Pickman, Jr. Rebecca Crowninshield Browne married Robert F. Bradford, who was Governor of Massachusetts from 1947 to 1949. Francis Boardman Crowninshield married the former Louise Evaline du Pont (later Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield) of the Du Pont family. =First home= On June 20, 1700, in Massachusetts Bay Colony, Dr. John Casper Richter von Crowninshield (Johannes Kaspar Richter von Kronenscheldt, as first spelled), became a historic landowner of an estate by Spring Pond in Lynn and Salem, married Elizabeth, daughter of the former land owners of the estate. He was a physician from Germany, descended from a noble family of the Kingdom of Saxony. He bought the land near Spring Pond with all the ‚Äúhouses, buildings, waters, and fishings‚Äù from Elizabeth (Clifford) Allen of Salem, widow of Jacob Allen. He settled on the land in the interest of retreat and farming. =Friends and rivals= The Crowninshields also had close associations with other elite families, including the Monroes, Jeffersons, and Madisons. Robert Gould Shaw was a close friend of Benjamin W. Crowninshield (not to be confused with Benjamin Williams Crowninshield) at Harvard. The Crowninshields also periodically lived with other noted figures, such as William Bentley, who boarded with the family in Salem from 1791 to 1819; Andrew Jackson and his wife, who lived with Benjamin William Crowninshield and his family in Georgetown; and Cond√© Nast, who was Frank Crowninshield's New York City roommate. Although they were known for feuding with other noted families, particularly the anti-Jeffersonian Derby family of Salem, they also had close connections to the powerful. During the Salem witch trials, the Crowninshields were aligned on the side of John Hathorne, one of the associate magistrates of the trials; no Crowninshields were accused during the trials. =Education= Early Crowninshields were typically educated at institutions like St. Paul's School and Phillips Academy, followed by Harvard University, Harvard Law School, Williams College, or the service academies. Family members have held trusteeships and provost positions at Harvard College and Boston College, among other institutions. Historic sites The Crowninshield-Bentley House, Salem, Massachusetts The Crowninshield influence is particularly visible in Essex County, Massachusetts, and especially in their historical homebase of Salem. The homestead of Captain John Crowninshield, son of Johannes Caspar Richter von Kronenschieldt and Elizabeth Allen, survives as the Crowninshield- Bentley House, which is governed by the Peabody Essex Museum and is part of Salem's historical tourism industry. Benjamin Williams Crowninshield's federal-style waterfront mansion, once used by President James Monroe on a trip to Salem, is now used as home for the Brookehouse for Women. Some other sites, such as the Crowninshield Wharf have been lost to time and damage. Other places and things named for the family include Crowninshield Island, located off nearby Marblehead, and , a during World War I. There are also streets named for members of the Crowninshield family in Providence (Rhode Island); Brookline, Marblehead, and Peabody (Massachusetts); and The Bronx (New York City), all locations where noted Crowninshields lived. Family members are buried in several of New England's most prominent cemeteries, including Mount Auburn Cemetery and the ancient burial ground in Salem. In popular culture Although less common today, references to the Crowninshield family in popular culture were prevalent in earlier American society. Some examples include: * Across to Singapore, a film loosely based on seafaring adventures of the Crowninshields, featured Joan Crawford as the fictional Priscilla Crowninshield * The Running of the Tide, a novel by Esther Forbes, was based on the family * A nightclub at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada, replicates features of the original Cleopatra's BargeCleopatra's Barge Harrah's Caesar's palace web site * Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, a 1994 film, included a depiction of Frank Crowninshield played by Peter Benchley * \\"The Thing on the Doorstep,\\" a short story by H. P. Lovecraft set in a town based on Salem, mentions the Crowninshield-Bentley House * In one of E.E. 'Doc' Smith's novels in the Lensman series, an enemy base is disguised as an office building belonging to the wealthy Crowninshield family. * In The Devil and Tom Walker, a short story by Washington Irving, one of the damned souls is named Absalom Crowninshield, who is reputed to have been a buccaneer.

Autocovariance is closely related to the autocorrelation of the process in question.  Auto-covariance of stochastic processes  = Definition = With the usual notation operatorname{E} for the expectation operator, if the stochastic process left{X_tright} has the mean function mu_t = operatorname{E}[X_t], then the autocovariance is given by where t_1 and t_2 are two moments in time. = Definition for weakly stationary process = If left{X_tright} is a weakly stationary (WSS) process, then the following are true: :mu_{t_1} = mu_{t_2} triangleq mu for all t_1,t_2 and :operatorname{E}[X_t^2] < infty for all t and :operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_1,t_2) = operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_2 - t_1,0) triangleq operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_2 - t_1) = operatorname{K}_{XX}(tau), where tau = t_2 - t_1 is the lag time, or the amount of time by which the signal has been shifted. The autocovariance function of a WSS process is therefore given by: which is equivalent to :operatorname{K}_{XX}(tau) = operatorname{E}[(X_{t+ tau} - mu_{t +tau})(X_{t} - mu_{t})] = operatorname{E}[X_{t+tau} X_t] - mu^2 . = Normalization = It is common practice in some disciplines (e.g. statistics and time series analysis) to normalize the autocovariance function to get a time-dependent Pearson correlation coefficient. However in other disciplines (e.g. engineering) the normalization is usually dropped and the terms \\"autocorrelation\\" and \\"autocovariance\\" are used interchangeably. The definition of the normalized auto-correlation of a stochastic process is :rho_{XX}(t_1,t_2) = frac{operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_1,t_2)}{sigma_{t_1}sigma_{t_2}} = frac{operatorname{E}[(X_{t_1} - mu_{t_1})(X_{t_2} - mu_{t_2})]}{sigma_{t_1}sigma_{t_2}}. If the function rho_{XX} is well- defined, its value must lie in the range [-1,1], with 1 indicating perfect correlation and ‚àí1 indicating perfect anti-correlation. For a WSS process, the definition is :rho_{XX}(tau) = frac{operatorname{K}_{XX}(tau)}{sigma^2} = frac{operatorname{E}[(X_t - mu)(X_{t+tau} - mu)]}{sigma^2}. where :operatorname{K}_{XX}(0) = sigma^2. =Properties= Symmetry property :operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_1,t_2) = overline{operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_2,t_1)}Kun Il Park, Fundamentals of Probability and Stochastic Processes with Applications to Communications, Springer, 2018, 978-3-319-68074-3 respectively for a WSS process: :operatorname{K}_{XX}(tau) = overline{operatorname{K}_{XX}(-tau)} Linear filtering The autocovariance of a linearly filtered process left{Y_tright} :Y_t = sum_{k=-infty}^infty a_k X_{t+k}, is :K_{YY}(tau) = sum_{k,l=-infty}^infty a_k a_l K_{XX}(tau+k-l).,  Calculating turbulent diffusivity Autocovariance can be used to calculate turbulent diffusivity. Turbulence in a flow can cause the fluctuation of velocity in space and time. Thus, we are able to identify turbulence through the statistics of those fluctuations. Reynolds decomposition is used to define the velocity fluctuations u'(x,t) (assume we are now working with 1D problem and U(x,t) is the velocity along x direction): :U(x,t) = langle U(x,t) rangle + u'(x,t), where U(x,t) is the true velocity, and langle U(x,t) rangle is the expected value of velocity. If we choose a correct langle U(x,t) rangle, all of the stochastic components of the turbulent velocity will be included in u'(x,t). To determine langle U(x,t) rangle, a set of velocity measurements that are assembled from points in space, moments in time or repeated experiments is required. If we assume the turbulent flux langle u'c' rangle (c' = c - langle c rangle, and c is the concentration term) can be caused by a random walk, we can use Fick's laws of diffusion to express the turbulent flux term: :J_{text{turbulence}_x} = langle u'c' rangle approx D_{T_x} frac{partial langle c rangle}{partial x}. The velocity autocovariance is defined as :K_{XX} equiv langle u'(t_0) u'(t_0 + tau)rangle or K_{XX} equiv langle u'(x_0) u'(x_0 + r)rangle, where tau is the lag time, and r is the lag distance. The turbulent diffusivity D_{T_x} can be calculated using the following 3 methods:  Auto-covariance of random vectors   See also  * Autoregressive process * Correlation * Cross- covariance * Cross-correlation * Noise covariance estimation (as an application example)  References  Lecture notes on autocovariance from WHOI Fourier analysis Autocorrelation ","title":"Autocovariance"},{"id":"1202318","text":"New Millennium Program (NMP) was a NASA project with focus on engineering validation of new technologies for space applications.

It is considered to be one of the most beautiful castles in Slovakia. The castle was built in the Kingdom of Hungary in the thirteenth century. Many scenes of the 1922 film Nosferatu were filmed here, the castle representing Count Orlok's Transylvanian castle. Orava Castle stands on the site of an old wooden fortification, built after the Mongol invasion of Hungary of 1241. Its history follows a familiar pattern of construction, destruction, reconstruction, fire, various ownerships and territorial squabbles. The original design was in Romanesque and Gothic style; it was later reconstructed as a Renaissance and Neo-Gothic structure, hugging the shape of the 520-metre spur on which it perches. The mining magnate Thurzo family, who took charge in the mid-16th century, were responsible for a great deal of rebuilding work, although its present form was not finalised until 1611. It burned down again in 1800, after which it was no longer used as a residence. After a period of dilapidation dating until World War II, the castle became a national monument. Origins Orava Castle from above The natural rock formation known as \\"castle cliff\\" ‚Äì a limy spur 112 meters (367 ft) high, surrounded by the river Orava and its right tributary stream ‚Äì has been inhabited since primeval times. During its history a wooden rampart became a strong walled castle of which the first written record dates back to 1267. At that time only the ground floor was built of stone, while the upper floors were made of wood. In 1370 as part of the Hungarian Kingdom the castle became the center of √Årva county. A tetrahedral multi-story towerntury was built here in the 14th century, probably on older foundations, as a donjon ‚Äì the place of \\"last defense\\" within the castle. After 1474, King Matthias Corvinus gave orders to build a square and a residence-wing in the Middle Castle. The buildings were situated in front of the castle. In 1534 John of Dubovec obtained the castle and became head of the county. He started to rebuild the castle and to make new fortifications. He ordered the building of a half-round tower in the Upper Castle that in 1539 was followed by two large round fortifications for cannons in the Middle Castle. The middle platform was also configured for cannon firing. In the years 1539 to 1543 John of Dubovec built a five-story palace in the empty space between the tower and the stone wall of the Upper Castle. The threat of Ottoman invasion was the reason for building these new fortifications. A new gate with a ditch and drawbridge in the Lower Castle was completed in 1543. The Tower of the Archives was built against the castle walls. 16th‚Äì18th centuries View of the Castle After the death of John of Dubovec, his heirs quarreled over the inheritance and the situation became so bad that the castle even became a store-house. It was paid for by the mine owner Ferenc Thurz√≥. A lot of building activity took place at the castle following this time period. The wooden stairs in the Upper Castle were replaced by stone stairs. The same was done to the stairs between the Middle and the Upper Castle with the drawbridge. A cellar was also dug out of the stone of the castle court and a single-story residence-wing was built in the lower castle near the west wall. Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥ also carried out some important repairs. One of the first was the building of a tunnel between both castle gates, above which was formed a large terrace. After this was all done he moved the living-quarters and the building of the chapel started using parts of some old architecture. The interior furnishing of the chapel was later arranged in a taste which suited the new owners of the castle. One of the most well-known features is the Renaissance grave tomb of Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥ from the beginning of the 17th century and the Baroque altar from 1751‚Äì1752. Disuse, fire and the museum View of the lower castle After the death of Erzs√©bet Czobor, the widow of Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥, the castle became the property of Thurz√≥'s daughters, who entrusted its administration to an elected administrator. Because of changes in politics, society and the economy, the castle gradually lost its important functions. Only a few clerks stayed on and the uninhabited and disused parts of the castle gradually deteriorated. The greatest catastrophe affected the castle in 1800, when a gigantic fire destroyed all the wooden parts of the castle. Some objects from the Lower Castle were recovered after the fire because they had been covered by the roof shingles. However, the objects from the Middle and Upper Castle were not reconstructed until 1861. To find a use for the historical object, √ñd√∂n Zichy, the administrator of the property (as administrator of Veszpr√©m County), organized a foundation which had the aim of founding a regional museum of Orava. The first exhibition took place at the Thurzo Palace in 1868. Nowadays, the Orava Museum is one of the oldest in Slovakia. Its most attractive expositions are those of the Castle Chapel, the Knights' Room, and several rooms with period-style furnishing. Further highlights include the Painting Gallery, the Weapon room, and the scientific, ethnographic and archaeological collections. Cultural references Many scenes of the 1922 film Nosferatu were filmed here, the castle representing Count Orlok's Transylvanian castle; In their 2020 TV adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat also used Orava as their Castle Dracula.

In 1941, the Ford Motor Company followed with the first power windows on the Lincoln Custom (only the limousine and seven-passenger sedans). Cadillac had a straight-electric divider window (but not side windows) on their series 75. Power assists originated in the need and desire to move convertible body-style tops up and down by some means other than human effort. The earliest power assists were vacuum-operated and were offered on Chrysler Corporation vehicles, particularly the low-cost Plymouth convertibles in the late 1930s. Shortly before World War II, General Motors developed a central hydraulic pump for working convertible tops. This system was introduced on 1942 convertibles built by GM. Previously, GM had used a vacuum system which did not have the power to handle increasingly larger and complex (four side- windows vs. only two) convertible top mechanisms. Chief Engineer of the Buick Division, Charles A. Chayne, \\"...had introduced an electrically controlled hydraulic system into the 1946 Buick convertibles that provided fingertip operation of the top, door windows, and front seat adjustment\\". These systems were based on major hydraulic advances made in military weapons in preparation for World War II. The \\"Hydro-Electric\\" system (windows, front seat adjustment and convertible top) was standard on 1947 model year. The seat and window assist system became available on GM closed cars (standard on some Cadillac Series 75 models and all Series 60 Specials, commonly called \\"Fleetwood\\" beginning with the 1948). The full system was standard only on the high-end GM convertibles made by Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. It was only available as a package; that is, power assisted windows, front seat, and convertible top (where applicable). This feature can be identified in 1948 and later General Motors model numbers with an \\"X\\" at the end, such as the 1951 Cadillac Sixty Special sedan, model 6019X. The electrically operated hydraulic pump system was shared by Hudson and Packard for their 1948 through 1950 models. The driver's door contained four buttons in addition to the remaining individual windows. Ford also had a similar electro-hydraulic system on higher-end convertibles. Mercury and Ford Sportsman convertibles (with wood trim) were equipped with power windows on four windows from 1946 through 1948 and Mercury and Lincoln by 1951. These systems were used by other luxury car models (Imperial and Packard) until Chrysler introduced the all-electric operation on the 1951 Imperial. The availability of power windows increased with the use of small, high-torque electric motors. General Motors also followed with full electric operation in 1954. This included four-way and then six-way seats, which were introduced in 1956. Chevrolet introduced the oddity of power front windows (only) in the 1954 model. Ford also introduced full four-door power windows in sedans in 1954. The full-sized 1955 Nash \\"Airflyte\\" models featured optional power windows. Electrically-operated vent windows were available as early as 1956 on the Continental Mark II. The 1960s Cadillac Fleetwood came standard with power front and rear vent windows, in addition to standard power side windows, for a total of eight power window controls on the driver's door panel. Modern heavy-duty highway tractors frequently have an option for power window controls; however, these are generally what is referred to as \\"straight air\\". That is, the compressed air system used for air brakes is also used for the windows. These types of trucks have long used compressed air cylinders for seat height adjustment. In a similar fashion to the electro-hydraulic system, the compressed air is merely released to lower the window and/or seat. The compressed air is then admitted to the respective cylinder to raise the window or seat. In a typical auto/light truck installation, there is an individual switch at each window and a set of switches in the driver's door or a-frame pillar, so the driver can operate all the windows. These switches took on many different appearances, from heavy chrome plate to inexpensive plastic. However, some models like Saab, Volvo, Mazda and Holden have used switches located in the center console, where they are accessible to all the occupants. In this case, the door-mounted switches can be omitted. This also removes the need to produce separate door components and wiring for left and right-hand drive variants.  Operation  Power windows are usually inoperable when the car is not running. This is primarily a security feature. It would be a simple thing to allow electric power windows to be operable when the ignition is turned off, however it would also make the car much easier to steal. Some systems offer the compromise of leaving power applied to the windows until a passenger door is opened at which time the window power is removed. Hydraulic drive systems could lower the windows at rest, since pressure from the hydraulic system was merely released to lower the window. Raising the windows required an electrically operated pump to operate and introduce pressure at the appropriate cylinder. These systems also required pressure lines to each cylinder (in the doors, as well as on certain cars, to the power seat and a power operated convertible top). Because of the complexity, the system could also leak fluid. Many modern cars have a time delay feature, first introduced by Cadillac in the 1980s, called \\"retained accessory power\\". This allows operation of the windows and some other accessories for ten minutes or so after the engine is stopped. Another feature is the \\"express-down\\" window, which allows the window to be fully lowered with one tap on the switch, as opposed to holding the switch down until the window retracts. Many luxury vehicles during the 1990s expanded on this feature, to include \\"express-up\\" on the driver's window, and recently, some manufacturers have added the feature on all window switches for all passengers' convenience. This is done by activating the switch until a \\"click\\" response is felt. Power windows have become so common that by 2008, some automakers eliminated hand crank windows from all their models. So many vehicles now have power windows that some people no longer understand the (formerly) common sign from another driver of using their hand to simulate moving a window crank to indicate that they wish to speak with someone when stopped at a light or in a parking lot. The 2008 Audi RS4 sold in Europe, however, still has roll-up windows for the rear doors although its counterpart sold in the U.S. has power windows for all doors.  Safety  Power windows have come under some scrutiny after several fatal accidents in which children's necks have become trapped, leading to suffocation. Some designs place the switch in a location on a hand rest where it can be accidentally triggered by a child climbing to place his or her head out of the window. To prevent this, many vehicles feature a driver-controlled lockout switch, preventing rear-seat passengers (usually smaller children) from accidentally triggering the switches. This also prevents children from playing with them and pets riding with their heads out windows from activating the power window switch. Starting with the 2008 model year, U.S. government regulations required automakers to install safety mechanisms to improve child safety. However, the rules do not prevent all potential injuries to a hand, finger, or even a child's head, if someone deliberately holds the switch when the window is closing. In 2009, the U.S. auto safety administration tentatively decided against requiring all cars to have automatic reversing power windows if they sense an obstruction while closing. Proposed requirements concern automatic (\\"one-touch up\\") window systems, but most vehicles with this feature already have automatic-reversing. The federal government made a written contract that all automakers should make the lever switches (as opposed to the rocker and toggle switches) standard on all new vehicles by 1 October 2010.

It is named after its sheer cliffs of dark-colored biotite gneiss. Astride the Eastern Continental Divide at an elevation of , the park provides many scenic overlooks and vistas of the southern Appalachian Mountains. On a clear day, four states are visible: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. In addition to Black Rock Mountain itself, the park includes four other peaks over in elevation, making it the state's highest state park. As of 2019, it was open to visitors year round. History Most of the rock outcrops found throughout the park are made of biotite gneiss, a metamorphic rock that underlies a large portion of the Georgia Blue Ridge. Black Rock Mountain State Park was established in 1952 and originally consisted of . Before the park was established, Rabun County native John V. Arrendale began assembling the area that would later become the park, making his first purchase in 1938. Numerous purchases have added to the park's area, including added in 1995 with funding received from then-Governor Zell Miller's Preservation 2000 land acquisition program. Several smaller acquisitions have added acreage to the park's southwest corner. Climate Hiking and camping Blue Ridge overlook Observation deck for the Blue Ridge overlook There are five hiking trails through forests, alongside mountain streams and around Black Rock Lake. The Tennessee Rock Trail crosses Black Rock Mountain's north slope before climbing across the mountain's summit and following the Eastern Continental Divide.Pfitzer (2006), p. 151 From the trail's namesake feature, Tennessee Rock, vistas can be seen that extend northward into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, including Clingman's Dome, the highest point in Tennessee. The James E. Edmonds Trail is named for \\"Mr. Eddie\\" Edmonds, one of the park's earliest and longest-serving rangers. This rugged trail features four secluded campsites that allow backpackers with reservations to escape into the park's quiet backcountry. The campsites are undeveloped and offer no facilities. In places the Edmonds Trail weaves in and out of laurel-filled coves and follows mountain streams with small waterfalls.Black Rock Mountain State Park Trail Map, published by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (rev 02/2006) At the trail's northern end, there are Lookoff Mountain and views of Wolffork Valley, the source of the Little Tennessee River. The Ada-Hi Falls Trail is named for the Cherokee word for \\"forest\\". The quarter-mile trail begins near the entrance of the park's RV camping area and leads into a moist north-facing cove filled with rosebay rhododendron. The lower portion of the trail becomes very steep and utilizes a series of wooden steps before ending on the observation platform for Ada-hi Falls, a small cascade typical of falls found in the upper reaches of mountain coves. The trail is short but strenuous due to the elevation change. The Black Rock Lake Trail was completed in August, 2007. This gently rolling path encircles Black Rock Lake and features several wooden bridges that span streams, as well as trailside benches that afford scenic views of the lake. The park's newest trail, the Norma Campbell Cove Trail, is only 200 yards. It begins on the southern edge of the Eastern Continental Divide near the Marie Mellinger Center and descends into the upper reaches of a south-facing cove filled with ferns, mayapple and trillium. It passes huge boulders and large rock outcrops, as well as small springs that flow into Stekoa Creek, one of the principal tributaries of the federally designated \\"wild and scenic\\" Chattooga River. The cove and trail are named for the late Norma Campbell, a popular park naturalist, who led the decade-long effort to acquire funding for the construction of the Marie Mellinger Center, the park's primary programming and special event facility. Black Rock overlook The park offers a variety of camping experiences. It has a 44-site campground featuring water, electricity and cable TV hookups for recreational vehicles. There are also 12 isolated walk-in tent sites in Hickory Cove on the mountain's southeastern slope. On the park's westernmost ridge are ten rental cottages and Camp Tsatu-gi, a primitive pioneer campsite designed for use by organized groups. Marie Mellinger Center The park's newest facility, the Marie Mellinger Center, was completed in July 2010. Named for one of the region's most-noted botanists, the facility is designed to accommodate a variety of uses including special events; country, bluegrass, and gospel music programs; nature arts and crafts; and other naturalist-led programs. A deck overlooks densely forested Norma Campbell Cove. A separate construction project to add restroom facilities to the Mellinger Center was completed in March 2011. The facility was formally dedicated during a public ceremony on October 8, 2011. Black Rock Lake Black Rock Lake In September, 2010, Black Rock Lake was officially opened for boating for the first time since its construction in 1974. Canoes, kayaks, and other small boats are authorized. No boat ramps exist. The Turtle Rock Fishing Pier, near Taylors Chapel Road, is barrier-fee and offers easy lake access for fishermen with mobility challenges. During the spring and early summer, Black Rock Lake is regularly stocked with rainbow trout. In addition, anglers fish for catfish, bream, yellow perch, and large-mouth bass.

Tornado  On April 27, 2011, the park was hit by an EF-2 tornado spawned from the same supercell thunderstorm that had earlier in the evening tracked across central Alabama, heavily damaging Tuscaloosa. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, and large parts of the park's camping areas and summit area were damaged. In the camping area, several cars and trucks were crushed by falling trees, however, no injuries were sustained. The park was re-opened to the public on May 6; however, large swaths of downed timber remain, especially on the mountain's westernmost flank above 3,200 feet. Most park trails were re-opened on May 13, with the exception of the Ada-hi Falls Trail. A large section of wooden steps was crushed by fallen trees and will have to be replaced before the trail is re-opened.

It is a hydrated sodium and aluminium silicate with the formula . The type locality is Hohentwiel, Hegau, Germany. It was named natrolite by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1803. The name is derived from natron (), the Greek word for soda, in reference to the sodium content, and lithos (), meaning stone. Needle stone or needle-zeolite are other informal names, alluding to the common acicular habit of the crystals, which are often very slender and are aggregated in divergent tufts. The crystals are frequently epitaxial overgrowths of natrolite, mesolite, and gonnardite in various orders.  Properties  Larger crystals most commonly have the form of a square prism terminated by a low pyramid, the prism angle being nearly a right angle. The crystals are tetragonal in appearance, though actually orthorhombic. There are perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The mineral also often occurs in compact fibrous aggregates, the fibers having a divergent or radial arrangement. Natrolite is readily distinguished from other fibrous zeolites by its optical characteristics. Between crossed nicols the fibers extinguish parallel to their length, and they do not show an optic figure in convergent polarized light. Natrolite is usually white or colorless, but sometimes reddish or yellowish. The luster is vitreous, or, in finely fibrous specimens, silky. The specific gravity is 2.2, and the hardness is 5.5. The mineral is readily fusible, melting in a candle-flame to which it imparts a yellow color owing to the presence of sodium. It is decomposed by hydrochloric acid with separation of gelatinous silica.  Environment  Natrolite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic igneous rocks. It is also common in nepheline syenites.  Notable localities  Excellent specimens of diverging groups of white prismatic crystals are found in compact basalt at the Puy-deMarman, Puy-de-D√¥me, France. Huge crystals have been found on the Kola Peninsula, Russia (30 cm by 13 cm). The walls of cavities in the basalt of the Giants Causeway, in County Antrim, are frequently encrusted with slender needles of natrolite, and similar material is found abundantly in the volcanic rocks (basalt and phonolite) of Salesel, Aussig and several other places in the north of Bohemia. Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec has produced large crystals associated with many rare minerals. The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, New Jersey, Oregon, and British Columbia have also produced excellent specimens. Several varieties of natrolite have been distinguished by special Nips. Fargite is a red natrolite from Glenfarg in Perthshire. Bergmannite, or Spreustein, is an impure variety which has resulted by the alteration of other minerals, chiefly sodalite, in the augite syenite of southern Norway. Natrolite is one of the closely associated minerals with Benitoite, a rare mineral with the type locality in San Benito County, California.

Only minor amounts of sodium and traces of potassium substitute for calcium. There is an absence of barium, strontium, iron and magnesium.Zeolites of the World (1992) Scolecite is isostructural (having the same structure) with the sodium-calcium zeolite mesolite and the sodium zeolite natrolite, but it does not form a continuous chemical series with either of them. It was described in 1813, and named from the Greek word, œÉŒ∫œéŒªŒ∑Œæ (sko-lecks) = \\"worm\\" because of its reaction to the blowpipe flame. Crystal class It is monoclinic m with space group Cc, but crystals are pseudotetragonal. Scolecite, like natrolite and mesolite, usually occurs as acicular (needle-like) and fibrous aggregations. It has nearly the same angles between the crystal faces as does natrolite, but natrolite is orthorhombic and scolecite is monoclinic. The etched figures (figures that arise from the action of a solvent on a crystal face, and indicate its true symmetry) and the pyroelectric character of scolecite show that it crystallizes with a plane of symmetry, but no axis of symmetry, that is to say it belongs to the hemihedral class of the monoclinic system. Scolecite can therefore be distinguished from natrolite by an optical examination, since the acicular crystals do not extinguish parallel to their length between crossed nicol prisms. Twinning on the ortho-pinacoid is usually evident. Structure The structure of the aluminosilicate framework is the same for scolecite, natrolite and mesolite. Scolecite has long ordered chains, rotated 24¬∞ round the axis of the chain. One Ca cation and three H2O molecules are in four ion sites in the channels parallel to the c crystal axis. There is no sign of aluminium ions occupying silicon ion sites. Unit cell Scolecite is a monoclinic mineral, with the angle Œ≤ equal to about 109¬∞ and four formula units per unit cell (Z = 4). Described in this way, various sources give the following values for the parameters of the unit cell, which has one long side and two short ones: * a = 6.516 to 6.517 √Ö, b = 18.948 to 18.956 √Ö, c = 9.761 to 9.765 √Ö, Œ≤ = 108.86 to 108.98¬∞ * a = 6.52 to 6.53 √Ö, b = 18.96 to 18.97 √Ö, c = 9.76 to 9.78 √Ö, Œ≤ = 108.9¬∞ * a = 6.516 √Ö, b = 18.948 √Ö, c = 9.761 √Ö, Œ≤ = 108.98¬∞ Crystals, however, are pseudotetragonal, and this can be represented by taking a different unit cell, with twice as many formula units (Z = 8) and two long sides and one short one. The axes are redefined, a and b are very nearly equal and the angle Œ≤ between the new a and c axes is very nearly equal to 90¬∞ (a truly tetragonal crystal would have a = b and Œ≤ = 90¬∞ exactly). The sources give the following values: *a=18.488 to 18.508 √Ö, b=18.891 to 18.96 √Ö, c=6.527 to 6.548 √Ö, Œ≤ = 90.64 to 90.75¬∞ *a = 18.508(5) √Ö, b = 18.981(5) √Ö, c = 6.527(2) √Ö Œ≤ = 90.64¬∞ *a = 18.508(5) √Ö, b = 18.981(5) √Ö, c = 6.527(2) √Ö, Œ≤ = 90:64(1)¬∞ *a = 18.51 √Ö, b = 18.97 √Ö, c = 6.53 √Ö, Œ≤ = 90.6¬∞ Crystal habit Cluster of scolecite needles Scolecite commonly occurs as sprays of thin, prismatic needles, frequently flattened on one side, with slanted terminations and striated parallel to the length of the needles. The crystals appear to be pseudo-orthorhombic or pseudo-tetragonal, and may be square in cross section. It also occurs as radiating groups and fibrous masses. Epitaxial intergrowths (intergrowths of two different crystalline substances in a non-random way) with mesolite, Na2Ca2Al6Si9O30¬∑8H2O, are common. (Natrolite, Na2Al2Si3O10¬∑2H2O, does not directly form epitaxial overgrowths on scolecite). All three minerals may be developed in the same crystal. Scolecite crystals appear to be monoclinic by X-ray analysis.American Minerlaogist (1988) 73:613 Common forms include , , , and . Physical properties Scolecite is usually colorless or white, but can also be pink, salmon, red or green. It is transparent to translucent, with a white streak and a luster which is vitreous, or silky for fibrous specimens. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 to and a specific gravity in the range 2.16 to 2.40. (2.24 to 2.31 2.25 to 2.29 2.16 to 2.4 2.25 to 2.31). Cleavage is perfect in two directions parallel to the length of the crystals; the mineral is brittle with an irregular fracture. Twinning is common on , twin axis [001], as penetration or contact twins producing V-shaped or fishtail terminations. Scolecite is pyroelectric and piezoelectric, sometimes fluorescent yellow to brown in longwave and shortwave ultraviolet light. It is soluble in common acids. Not radioactive. Optical properties Biaxial (-) with refractive indices: Nx = 1.507 to 1.513, Ny = 1.516 to 1.520, Nz = 1.517 to 1.521. Pleochroism has been reported, X: colorless Y: colorless Z: colorless. Environment Scolecite is a common zeolite. It is a mineral of secondary origin, and occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities (cavities filled with secondary minerals) of weathered basalts, also in gneisses and amphibolites, and in laccoliths and dikes derived from syenitic and gabbroic magmas, and in contact metamorphic zones. It is a hydrothermal mineral derived from low temperature alteration of basalts and related rocks, associated with other zeolites, calcite, quartz and prehnite. It can be found on top of the calcium zeolites heulandite, stilbite and epistilbite. Associated minerals include quartz, apophyllite, babingtonite, heulandite, stilbite and other zeolites. Localities Scolecite was first described from Kaiserstuhl in Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1813. Divergent groups of prismatic crystals are found in the basalt of Berufj√∂r√∞ur near Dj√∫pivogur, Su√∞ur-M√∫las√Ωsla, Iceland and in the Deccan Traps near Pune in India; hence the synonym poonahlite for this species. Other occurrences include Riverside County, California; Skye, Scotland and Santa Catarina, Brazil. There is no type locality. Most of the world's finest scolecite specimens are found in the Tertiary Deccan Basalt near Nasik, Pune, in the state of Maharashtra, India. The quarries in the Nasik region produce large, colorless sprays of well terminated coarse scolecite crystals that are commonly twinned on to form V-shaped terminations with V-shaped striations on . The scolecite is commonly found alone or on stilbite and is covered with laumontite or colorless, pale green or white fluorapophyllite. It is also found in the region as massive radiating material with powellite, and in cavities in basalt as colorless, flattened crystals in radiating sprays on blocky green apophyllite covered by tiny, thin, colorless apophyllite plates. Scolecite has been reported from many other localities, including Antarctica, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Faroe Islands, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslavia.

Most of these peak gusts are from official stations The February 13, 1979 windstorm is a natural phenomenon that took place on February 13, 1979 in Pacific Canada and the United States. During the early morning of February 13, 1979, an intense wave cyclone moved across southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. South of the low center, a strong atmospheric pressure gradient was carried across Washington, with associated high winds. With a cold airflow moving toward the northeast interacting with the high terrain of the Olympic Mountains, a lee low developed east of the Olympics. The mesoscale low caused a particularly intense pressure gradient to develop across the Kitsap Peninsula region. Wind velocity At 6 mbar over 8 miles, the geostrophic wind potential easily exceeded 200 knots (which roughly translates to about 100 knots in ageostrophic flow over the Earth's rough surface, or 115 mph). As reported by the crew of the Hood Canal Bridge, average winds reached at least 80 mph out of the south, with gusts into the triple digits. These wind velocities were cross-checked on two different anemometers at the bridge control tower. Damage Extensive damage to trees on surrounding private timberland also corroborate the extreme intensity of this tempest. The pressure of wind and wave on the Hood Canal Bridge stressed the structure enough to cause catastrophic failure. It is suspected that a severe list in the bridge exposed pontoon access hatches to the waves, which subsequently tore the covers loose and allowed water to enter the flotation devices, causing sections to sink. It took nearly three years and over $140 million U.S. to rebuild the lost bridge.  See also  * Storm  Further reading  * Richard J.

Early life  Born in Montana, he came to Saskatchewan at an early age. His parents moved to a farm homestead at Netherhill, near Kindersley, in the west central region of the province. Because of his pioneer heritage, he was equally comfortable with internationally renowned scientists or with farmers in the field. He came to the University of Saskatchewan as a student and received a Bachelor-level degree in Physics (1925) and a Master-level degree in Physics (1927). His Ph.D. program at McGill University was completed in 1930.  Career  He was a staff member of the Department of Physics at the University of Saskatchewan (1928 - 1981), was Professor of Physics (1943‚Äì70) Head of the Department (1952‚Äì61), founder of the Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies (1956‚Äì66), Dean of Graduate Studies (1959‚Äì70) and Vice-president, Research (1967‚Äì74). Upon his retirement as Vice-president, he was appointed by the President of the University to be Special Advisor in Research Matters (1974‚Äì78). Later in 1974, he became Canadian Coordinator of the International Magnetospheric Study, and gave it his fullest attention until its completion at the end of 1979. During this period, he also pursued an earlier research interest in the possible influence of solar activity on prairie weather and rainfall. Early in his career, he spent two years in the Canadian Arctic. Currie and Frank Davies worked together at Chesterfield Inlet during the Second International Polar Year (1932-1933). An online archive of Currie's work on 2nd IPY studies of the Polar Year data continued under his direction at the University of Saskatchewan after World War II.  Recognition  In recognition of his outstanding contributions to his fields of study, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Meteorology Society of Great Britain in 1940, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1947. In 1967, he received the Patterson Medal from the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society.. In 1972, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada \\"for his services to science and education especially in the fields of meteorology and climatology\\". In 1977 he received an honorary Doctor of Science (space research) from York University.

It is also resistant to acid, ferric chloride and other chemicals used to etch metals. The fundamental method of its use was first described in two US Patents, USP 2610120 and USP 2670287, assigned to the Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester, New York. These photo-resistant resins are formed from cinnamic acid esters, with the most preferable being polyvinyl cinnamate. While they were developed primarily for photolithography for high-speed print setting for uses such as newspaper printing, their perhaps highest value came from their ability to produce non-conducting layers on top of conducting layers to precise dimensions. This enabled the \\"printing\\" of large scale, closely placed conductive and non-conductive pathways to create binary gates. These were semi-conductors or the means to create semiconductors. This technology was utilized heavily by the Shockley 8, at the original Fairchild Semiconductor to produce more and more closely spaced semiconductors for computing.

She was launched on 22 April 1945 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. C. P. Cecil; and commissioned on 29 June 1945 with Commander W. Outerson in command. Service history Charles P. Cecil arrived at San Diego, her home port, on 20 November 1945, and almost at once sailed on a tour of Pacific duty which found her operating as part of Joint Task Force One in the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, as well as supporting occupation forces with operations in Japanese waters. She returned to San Diego on 9 August 1946, and took part in exercises off the west coast until on 26 August 1947, when she cleared for her second deployment to the Far East. She touched at many Pacific islands as well as calling at ports in China, Japan and Okinawa before her return to San Diego on 5 May 1948. Reclassified DDR-835 on 18 March 1949, Charles P. Cecil left San Diego astern on 4 April 1949, bound for Newport, Rhode Island, and assignment to the Atlantic Fleet. First from Newport, and from December 1950, from Norfolk, Virginia, Charles P. Cecil operated through 1960 with the Atlantic Fleet, taking part in midshipmen training cruises, periodic deployments to the Mediterranean, and the overhauls and refresher training necessary to maintain her readiness. She participated in a long list of NATO operations, in waters ranging from those north of the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean. Her tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean included one which coincided with the Suez Crisis of fall 1956, during which she took up watchful patrol in the eastern Mediterranean. From January 1959, when she was fitted with highly complex electronic computational and tracking equipment, Charles P. Cecil concentrated on air defense experiments and exercises, contributing to the development of advanced techniques. Her training, however, continued to include the areas such as anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations required of the versatile destroyer. Charles P.

D. tinctorius azureus is also known by its indigenous Tirio name, okopipi. Its scientific name comes from its azure (blue) color. While frequently considered a valid species in the past, recent authorities treat it as a variant of D. tinctorius. Description D. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" frogs in captivity. D. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" is a medium-sized frog that weighs about 8 g and grows to 3.0-4.5 cm in length. Females are larger and about half a centimeter longer than males, but males have larger toes. The frog has a typical lifespan of five to seven years in the wild. Its bright blue skin, usually darker around its limbs and stomach, serves as a warning to predators. The glands of poisonous alkaloids located a defense mechanism to potential predators. These poisons paralyze and sometimes kill the predator. The black spots are unique to each frog, enabling individuals to be identified. This species of frog has a distinctive hunch-backed posture. Each foot has four toes, which each have a flattened tip with a suction cup pad used for gripping. The tips of the toes in females are round, while males have heart- shaped tips. As with almost all frogs, tadpoles differ greatly in appearance from adults. They have a long tail, about 6 mm, with a total length around 10 mm. They lack legs and have gills instead of lungs. Behavior Blue poison frog D. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" D. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" is a mainland animal, but stays close to water sources. These frogs spend most of their awake time, during the day, hopping around in short leaps. They are very territorial and aggressive both towards their own species and others. To ward off intruders, they use a series of calls, chases, and wrestling. Although poison dart frogs are known for their skin toxins, used on the tips of arrows or darts of natives, in reality only the species of the genus Phyllobates are used in this manner. In captivity, the frogs lose toxicity as a result of altered diets. Reproduction The blue poison dart frog breeds most commonly in February and March. To find mates, the males sit on a lake and produce extremely loud calls, which the females follows to track down the males. The females then physically fight over a male. Fertilization occurs externally; once the eggs are laid, the male covers them in his sperm. Between five and 10 offspring are produced at each mating. Eggs are laid in the male's territory, which he defends. The male takes care of the eggs, sometimes joined by the female. The eggs hatch after 14 to 18 days, and after 6 to 8 weeks the tadpoles are fully mature. Both sexes reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The expected lifespan of D. tinctorius azureus is about 10 years in the wild, and about 12 years in captivity. Feeding The blue poison dart frog feeds on ants, beetles, flies, mites, spiders, termites, maggots, and caterpillars. Captive care In captivity, like most captive dart frogs, they eat a staple diet of fruit flies, pinhead crickets, rice flour beetle larvae, and springtails.

If an amplifier were perfectly linear, no distortion (harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion) would occur (although random noise may still be introduced). Vacuum tube amplifiers tend to exhibit soft clipping; as they approach the maximum possible output value, the gain tends to drop, rounding the tops of the signal waveform. Transistor amplifiers, by comparison, tend to produce hard clipping; the gain remains approximately the same until the maximum possible output voltage is reached; at that point, hard clipping occurs and the waveform never exceeds that value. The sharp inflection points thus produced in the output waveform tend to have many more high-order harmonics.

One of the largest and most scenic parks in Georgia, it contains rugged geology, and offers visitors a range of vistas across the deep gorge cut through the mountain by Sitton Gulch Creek, where the elevation varies from 800 to over 1,800 feet.Brown (1996), p. 11 Views of the canyon can be seen from the picnic area parking lot, in addition to additional views located along the rim trail. At the bottom of the gorge, two waterfalls cascade across layers of sandstone and shale, ending in small pools below. The park, previously known as Sitton Gulch (or Gulf) or Trenton Gulf, was purchased in stages by the state of Georgia beginning in 1938. Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a project of Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression built the first facilities and signs in the park, which opened the following year. Today the park features a variety of campsites, cabins, hiking and recreational activities. History Cloudland Canyon was designated a state park in 1939 when the state began acquiring land from private owners. Three of these owners, from the Mathews, McCauley and McKaig families, still reside in the area. Expansion of the park continues sporadically as new land is purchased for it. The park was originally , and has been expanded to its present size of . Until 1939 the only access to the area (and much of Dade County, Georgia) was through Tennessee or Alabama. That year Georgia began work on Highway 136 to connect U.S. 41 to the recently established park. The Civilian Conservation Corps did much of the early work to construct the state park and access roads. Geology Hemlock Falls, formerly known as Cloudland Canyon Falls 2 in Cloudland Canyon State Park, Georgia The park is located on the Cumberland Plateau, atop Lookout Mountain. On the summit of Lookout Mountain, the waters of Daniel Creek and Bear Creek cut gorges through the rock, converging to form Sitton Gulch Creek.Molloy, (2007), p.12 The flat-topped mountains of the Cumberland Plateau are significantly different from the narrow Armuchee ridges beyond nearby Chickamauga Valley to the east. From a geological standpoint, Lookout Mountain is transitional between the flat-lying sedimentary beds of central Tennessee, and the ridges and valley to the east, which display more intensive folding and faulting.Brown (1996), p. 3 Most of the canyon's rock formations consist of sandstone; shale layers below the sandstone are marked by pine trees. Lookout Mountain was created through a combination of tectonic activity and erosion. It was uplifted during the period of mountain building that formed the Appalachians, known as the Appalachian orogeny. Over 200 million years ago, the modern-day parklands lay beneath an ocean. When first formed, the entire mountain was underwater, but the rim of the canyon eventually became a beach along the edge of the receding ocean. As the ocean dried up, Sitton Gulch Creek and its tributaries, particularly Daniel Creek, eroded the rock. The sandstone forming the bluffs has a tendency to fracture into blocks, creating unusual boulder formations. The concave shape of the top of Lookout Mountain also drains rainwater through fissures into the underlying limestone, forming miles of caves in the area. The canyon is more than deep, ranging in elevation from to over ; the park's peak elevation is . The bottom of Cloudland canyon contains a slope of rock talus, which are sandstone and shale fragments. The valley floor is also rich in fossil-bearing limestone. Hiking trails Cloudland Canyon as viewed from the top of the gorge The Park contains several well-marked trails which allow visitors to view the geology of the canyon and its surroundings. A paved, wheelchair-accessible trail about long overlooks the rim of the canyon. The park also features four more extensive hiking trails, including one backpacking trail. These trails are generally considered moderate in difficulty.Pfitzer (2006), p. 35 The Waterfalls Trail begins on a paved section, at the main overlook, and progresses into the canyon along a 40-degree slope. Most of the trail consists of gravel, and a 600-step staircase. Each waterfall emanates from Daniel Creek, and both cascade down sheer faces at and . The trail is generally considered to be a strenuous hike, which can take up to 90 minutes to complete. Cherokee Falls is from the trailhead; Hemlock Falls, at the bottom of the canyon, appears at .Pfitzer (1993), pp. 33-34 Each cascades into small pools at the base of the canyon, and continue down through a boulder-strewn stream bed. The creek flow feeding the waterfalls varies considerably according to the season. The Sitton's Gulch trail, commencing at the bottom of the Waterfalls Trail, runs parallel to the creek until it ends in a parking area in Trenton. In contrast, the long West Rim Loop Trail is rated as moderately difficult, although it contains a few short, steep rocky sections.Pfitzer (2006), pp. 35-36 A scenic hikePfitzer (2006), p. 36 beginning at the Daniels Creek Bridge, it offers panoramic views before climbing out of the canyon and onto the plateau. This trail also provides views of Trenton, Georgia, neighboring Sand Mountain, and of Cloudland Canyon. Rhododendron and mountain laurel thickets are interspersed with sour gum and dogwood; large oaks, hickories, hemlocks and maples shade the trail. Cottages and walk-in camping areas are accessible via the West Rim Loop. Passing over varied terrain, most of the hike is moderately difficult, and is considered strenuous along several short sections. The Backcountry Loop Trail provides access to the park's eleven secluded primitive hike-in camping sites.Pfitzer (2006), p. 39 Beginning at the parking area for group camping, the trail passes through hemlock groves, before descending on a moderate grade into a hollow filled with spring and summer flowers. At the far end of the loop, hikers emerge from the hemlock groves onto level trail, among oaks and hickories, before returning to the parking area.Pfitzer (2006), p. 36. Also see Pfitzer (1993), second edition of Hiking Georgia for additional details on the Backcountry Loop Trail which do not appear in the third edition. In the fall of 2011, the park reopened the Bear Creek Trail, which had been closed to hikers for nearly a decade. This approximately trail is the longest trail in the park. This trail begins as a spur off of the Back Country Trail and drops down to Bear Creek. After crossing the creek, the trail continues up until it becomes a loop around the northeast portion of the park. Around the area of the creek, the trail crosses over private property for a brief distance. During wet seasons, the creek crossing can be difficult as there is no bridge or dry crossing available. Facilities and activities Cloudland Canyon State park features a variety of camping and lodging options. There are 16 rental cottages as well as a group lodge. The park also offers 62 tent, trailer and RV sites, 28 walk-in camp sites, and 10 backcountry camp sites for backpackers. Four pioneer campsites provide facilities for groups of tent campers. The East Rim has 24 camp sites located along a loop road; many of the sites can accommodate RVs, and all feature water and electric hookups. Bathing facilities are located nearby. The West Rim Camp ground, located across the gorge and away from the park's busiest section, is located in thick forest, and hosts approximately 48 camp sites spread along two loops. It too offers bathing facilities.Molloy (2007), p. 12 Picnic areas include a group pavilion, tennis courts, a children's playground and a disc golf course. The park has an interpretive center near the main parking lot, adjacent to the canyon. Annual events hosted in the park include a Wildflower Program in April, Adventure Weekend (also in April), and a Kids' Catfish Rodeo in May.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 19, 1992. In the episode, Homer buys a snow plow and starts a business plowing driveways. It is a huge success, and inspired by this, Barney Gumble starts a rival company and quickly puts Homer out of business. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Jim Reardon. The episode was well received, with some critics calling it one of the best in the show's history. In 1993, Dan Castellaneta won his second Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\\" for this episode (Castellaneta performs the voice of both Homer and Barney in the series). The episode was also submitted in the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" category although ultimately it was not nominated. Plot Springfield is hit by a blizzard, so Marge calls Homer at Moe's Tavern and tells him to come home. While on the way home, Homer's view is obscured by the snow and he crashes into the family's station wagon. As both cars are completely totaled, Homer begins searching for a new car, and after several unsuccessful attempts, the family go to a car show. After an unsettling encounter with Adam West, a salesman talks Homer into getting a snowplow. Homer agrees on the basis that he can make the payments by plowing people's driveways. Homer starts his snowplowing business, titled \\"Mr. Plow\\", but he has trouble finding any customers. His advertising campaigns are unsuccessful until Lisa suggests an advertisement on late night local television. The resulting commercial and jingle attracts many customers and the business is a booming success. Homer is given the key to the city in recognition of his service to the community. Barney, after being humiliated while working as a mascot for a baby supply store, asks how he can be a success as well. Homer advises him go out and be the best Barney he can be. The next day, it is revealed that Barney has purchased an even bigger plow and has started a rival company under the title of \\"Plow King\\". Barney creates his own commercial, with Linda Ronstadt involved in singing the jingle, which defames and slanders Homer. Homer pays an agency to make him a new commercial, which turns out to be completely nonsensical. As a result, Homer loses his success to Barney, and Mayor Quimby revokes his key to the city and hands it over to Barney. To get revenge and regain his customers, Homer tricks Barney into plowing a non-existent driveway on Widow's Peak, a large treacherous mountain outside of town. Homer begins to plow driveways again, but sees a news report showing that Barney has been trapped in an avalanche. Homer immediately drives to the mountain and rescues Barney. The friends resolve their differences and agree to work together in the plow business, claiming that not even God Himself can stop them. Angered, God promptly retaliates by causing a heatwave, melting all the snow and effectively putting them both out of business. As Homer can no longer make the snowplow payments, his plow is soon repossessed, returning things to normal. However, Homer retains the Mr. Plow jacket as a memento from his earlier job, and Marge asks him to wear it to bed. Production On the telephone, Homer pretends to be actor Tony Dow, and calls people gay. This joke was originally going to be censored for legal reasons. When the episode was being written, many writers' contracts had just expired, so there was a small number of writers at the annual story retreat. Al Jean was very nervous about how they could write a whole new season with such a small crew. In addition, there were several scenes added after the animatic, making the schedule even tighter. However, Jon Vitti was very committed to this episode and pitched almost the entire plot by himself. Vitti's inspiration for the episode was when he noticed that very few TV shows portray snow outside of Thanksgiving or Christmas, so he wanted to do an episode with snow involved. From this idea he developed the \\"friends in competition with each other\\" plot, which led to Homer getting the plow from a car show. From this came Vitti's plan; have Adam West be at the car show, so then they could hire him for the voice acting and Vitti could finally meet him. The other writers agreed because they were all big fans of Batman when they were children and also wanted to meet Adam West. Matt Groening said that West was one of the most popular people to ever come to the studio. Linda Ronstadt was recorded in San Francisco. Jon Vitti was tasked with recording Ronstadt and he enjoyed it immensely. He remarked the most beautiful thing he has ever heard is Ronstadt singing the Spanish Plow King jingle.After the commercial sequence mentioned above, there is a later scene in which Ronstadt says she wants to record a Spanish version of the jingle, after which she sings a few translated lines. Two more script changes that put extra pressure on the episode were a post-animatic rewrite and a complete character change. In the original script for the episode, Lenny was going to be Homer's rival as the Plow King. The idea was quickly dropped because it did not seem to fit in. The post-animatic rewrite was to include the joke in which Homer uses the radio dial to tip the precariously balanced plow back onto the road. This joke was created by Conan O'Brien, and the writers liked it so much that they included it in the episode. The Simpsons team encountered trouble with the network censors in the scene where Homer answers the phone and pretends to be Tony Dow from Leave it to Beaver. After a brief pause Homer replies to an inquiry by the person on the phone with \\"Yeah, they were gay.\\" The censors refused to allow the line to be aired fearing legal recourse for libel. The Simpsons crew protested, arguing that no one in particular was being implied, and that the \\"they\\" could be anybody. After numerous phone calls and arguments, the censors allowed the joke to air. Cultural references The episode parodies Walter Cronkite's reporting of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This episode contains several references that Al Jean referred to as \\"very obscure\\". Examples of this include the scene where Homer drives through the treacherous mountain roads, a parody of a scene in Sorcerer, and the scene in which Kent Brockman reports Barney's accident, in which his attire (including glasses), camera angles and facial expressions are in reference to the manner of Walter Cronkite's reporting of the Kennedy shooting. The revamped \\"Mr. Plow commercial\\" is a parody of a similar perfume commercial that aired at the time of the episode's production. The fast moving clouds were taken from Koyaanisqatsi, a documentary film. The music that was used in the commercial was from \\"Casta Diva\\" from Vincenzo Bellini's Norma because the Simpsons crew would not have to pay for it. At the time the episode was made, Russia did not abide by American copyright laws. In return, America did not respect Russia's copyright laws. Homer's original jingle, \\"Call Mr. Plow, that's my name, that name again is Mr. Plow!\\", is based on a radio jingle for the Roto-Rooter, which had a similar tune, \\"Call Roto-Rooter, that's the name, and away go troubles down the drain.\\" Other references include the Carnival of the Stars television show seen at the start of the episode. This is a parody of Circus of the Stars, an annual special that aired on CBS from 1976‚Äì1994, featuring celebrities performing circus acts. The scene where Barney gradually degrades into a drunk is a parody of the transformation sequence in the 1941 film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The scene where Bart is pelted with snowballs is a reference to the Sonny Corleone tollbooth shooting scene in the film The Godfather. The snowmen melting during the heatwave is a reference to the melting Nazi soldiers in the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Linda Ronstadt's desire to record a Spanish version of the Plow King jingle, along with her mariachi costume in Barney's commercial, both refer to her notoriety at the time for recording several popular Spanish-language albums celebrating the music of Mexico, beginning with Canciones de Mi Padre. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Mr. Plow\\" finished 23rd in ratings for the week of November 16‚Äì22, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.6, equivalent to approximately 13.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Married... with Children. In 2003, the episode was placed sixth on Entertainment Weekly's top 25 The Simpsons episode list. In June 2009, Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.8 out of 10 and said it was \\"a fantastic episode that told an engaging story and was laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish. [...] There was a fun, engaging story, great guest stars poking fun at themselves, flashbacks, songs, cutaways and opportunities to highlight characters outside the series' namesake family.\\" In January 2010, Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the second best in the show's history. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, enjoyed the episode. They said that it is: \\"A good one. The highlights; the TV show Carnival of Stars, featuring Angela Lansbury walking on hot coals ('Excitement, she wrote!'), Homer's flashback to all he's done for Barney, and best of all, the McMahon & Tate ad agency's arty commercial for Mr. Plow.\\" In June 2012, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club stated that the episode \\"isn't just spectacularly funny and filled with classic bits: it also foretells the future. Not bad for an animated cartoon from the 1990s.\\" When asked to pick his favourite season out of The Simpsons seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the Niagara Gazette picked season four and highlighted \\"Brother from the Same Planet\\" and \\"Mr. Plow\\" which he called \\"excellent\\", along with \\"the sweetly funny\\" \\"Lisa's First Word\\", and \\"Homer the Heretic\\". The episode's reference to The Godfather was named the 37th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film's Nathan Ditum. Ditum also ranked West's performance as the seventh best guest appearance in the show's history. When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former Simpsons writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. =Awards= In 1993, Dan Castellaneta won an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\\" for his performance as Homer in this episode. It was his second consecutive Emmy, as he had also won in the same category the previous year. In 1993, \\"Mr. Plow\\" and \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" were submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\". The Simpsons' staff had previously submitted episodes for \\"Outstanding Animated Program\\", winning twice, but that season they took a chance with the main comedy category. However, the Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs, and The Simpsons did not receive a nomination. The Simpsons' crew submitted episodes for Outstanding Comedy Series the next season, but again these were not nominated. Since then, the show has submitted episodes in the animation category and has won eight times. Legacy On December 17, 2015, Google and YouTube modernized the episode and its \\"Mr. Plow\\" jingle for use in a commercial in which Lisa uses the website on her computer to place Homer's ad onto its YouTube campaign.

Design and development The Tomahawk is a single-engined low- wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail and an enclosed cabin for two. It has a fixed tricycle landing gear and is powered by a Lycoming O-235 four-cylinder piston engine with a twin-bladed tractor propeller. The Tomahawk has two front-hinged doors for access to the cabin. The Tomahawk was Piper's attempt at creating an affordable two-place trainer. Before designing the aircraft, Piper widely surveyed flight instructors for their input into the design. Instructors requested a more spinnable aircraft for training purposes, since other two-place trainers such as the Cessna 150 and 152 were designed to spontaneously fly out of a spin. The Tomahawk's NASA GA(W)-1 Whitcomb airfoil addresses this requirement by making specific pilot input necessary in recovering from spins, thus allowing pilots to develop proficiency in dealing with spin recovery. Tomahawk cockpit The Tomahawk was introduced in 1977 as a 1978 model. The aircraft was in continuous production until 1982 when production was completed, with 2,484 aircraft built. The 1981 and 1982 models were designated as the Tomahawk II. They incorporated improved cabin heating and windshield defroster performance, an improved elevator trim system, improved engine thrust vector, 100% airframe zinc-chromate anti-corrosion treatment, better cockpit soundproofing, larger 6\\" wheels and tires for greater propeller ground clearance and improved performance on grass and dirt runways, among other enhancements. = Safety record = A Piper PA-38-112 Tomahawk showing its rectangular wing planform. Stall strips can be seen as rectangular bumps along the aircraft's leading edge. According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Foundation, which published a Safety Highlight report on the Piper Tomahawk, the Piper Tomahawk has a one-third lower accident rate per flying hour than the comparable Cessna 150/152 series of two-place benchmark trainers. The Tomahawk has a higher rate of fatal spin accidents per flying hour. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estimated that the Tomahawk's stall/spin accident rate was three to five times that of the Cessna 150/152. According to the NTSB, the Tomahawk's wing design was modified after FAA certification tests, but was not retested. Changes included reducing the number of full wing ribs and cutting lightening holes in the main spar. The aircraft's engineers told the NTSB that the changes made to the design resulted in a wing that was soft and flexible, allowing its shape to become distorted and possibly causing unpredictable behavior in stalls and spins. The design engineers said that the GAW-1 airfoil required a rigid structure because it was especially sensitive to airfoil shape, and that use of a flexible surface with that airfoil would make the Tomahawk wing \\"a new and unknown commodity in stalls and spins.\\" Airworthiness Directive 83-14-08 issued in September 1983 mandated an additional pair of stall strips to be added to the inboard leading edge of the PA-38 wing to \\"standardize and improve the stall characteristics\\".  Operational history  As of 2020 a handful of Tomahawks are currently being used to train Australian Air Force Cadets in flight courses. These are operated from RAAF Base Amberley by 211 Squadron AAFC. These aircraft have been in service since the early 2000s.

It is designed to provide high availability and high throughput with low latency, while allowing for near linear scalability. MySQL Cluster is implemented through the NDB or NDBCLUSTER storage engine for MySQL (\\"NDB\\" stands for Network Database). Architecture MySQL Cluster is designed around a distributed, multi-master ACID compliant architecture with no single point of failure. MySQL Cluster uses automatic sharding (partitioning) to scale out read and write operations on commodity hardware and can be accessed via SQL and Non-SQL (NoSQL) APIs =Replication= Internally MySQL Cluster uses synchronous replication through a two-phase commit mechanism in order to guarantee that data is written to multiple nodes upon committing the data. (This is in contrast to what is usually referred to as \\"MySQL Replication\\", which is .) Two copies (known as replicas) of the data are required to guarantee availability. MySQL Cluster automatically creates ‚Äúnode groups‚Äù from the number of replicas and data nodes specified by the user. Updates are synchronously replicated between members of the node group to protect against data loss and support fast failover between nodes. It is also possible to replicate asynchronously between clusters; this is sometimes referred to as \\"MySQL Cluster Replication\\" or \\"geographical replication\\". This is typically used to replicate clusters between data centers for disaster recovery or to reduce the effects of network latency by locating data physically closer to a set of users. Unlike standard MySQL replication, MySQL Cluster's geographic replication uses optimistic concurrency control and the concept of Epochs to provide a mechanism for conflict detection and resolution,MySQL :: MySQL 5.6 Reference Manual :: 17.6.11 MySQL Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution. Dev.mysql.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-18. enabling active/active clustering between data centers. Starting with MySQL Cluster 7.2, support for synchronous replication between data centers was supported with the Multi-Site Clustering feature.Synchronously Replicating Databases Across Data Centers ‚Äì Are you Insane? (Oracle's MySQL Blog). Blogs.oracle.com (2011-10-03). Retrieved on 2013-09-18. =Horizontal data partitioning (auto-sharding)= MySQL Cluster is implemented as a fully distributed multi-master database ensuring updates made by any application or SQL node are instantly available to all of the other nodes accessing the cluster, and each data node can accept write operations. Data within MySQL Cluster (NDB) tables is automatically partitioned across all of the data nodes in the system. This is done based on a hashing algorithm based on the primary key on the table, and is transparent to the end application. Clients can connect to any node in the cluster and have queries automatically access the correct shards needed to satisfy a query or commit a transaction. MySQL Cluster is able to support cross-shard queries and transactions. Users can define their own partitioning schemes. This allows developers to add ‚Äúdistribution awareness‚Äù to applications by partitioning based on a sub-key that is common to all rows being accessed by high running transactions. This ensures that data used to complete transactions is localized on the same shard, thereby reducing network hops. =Hybrid storage= MySQL Cluster allows datasets larger than the capacity of a single machine to be stored and accessed across multiple machines. MySQL Cluster maintains all indexed columns in distributed memory. Non-indexed columns can also be maintained in distributed memory or can be maintained on disk with an in-memory page cache. Storing non-indexed columns on disk allows MySQL Cluster to store datasets larger than the aggregate memory of the clustered machines. MySQL Cluster writes Redo logs to disk for all data changes as well as check pointing data to disk regularly. This allows the cluster to consistently recover from disk after a full cluster outage. As the Redo logs are written asynchronously with respect to transaction commit, some small number of transactions can be lost if the full cluster fails, however this can be mitigated by using geographic replication or multi-site cluster discussed above. The current default asynchronous write delay is 2 seconds, and is configurable. Normal single point of failure scenarios do not result in any data loss due to the synchronous data replication within the cluster. When a MySQL Cluster table is maintained in memory, the cluster will only access disk storage to write Redo records and checkpoints. As these writes are sequential and limited random access patterns are involved, MySQL Cluster can achieve higher write throughput rates with limited disk hardware compared to a traditional disk-based caching RDBMS. This checkpointing to disk of in-memory table data can be disabled (on a per-table basis) if disk-based persistence isn't needed. =Shared nothing= MySQL Cluster is designed to have no single point of failure. Provided that the cluster is set up correctly, any single node, system, or piece of hardware can fail without the entire cluster failing. Shared disk (SAN) is not required. The interconnects between nodes can be standard Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, or SCI interconnects. =SQL and NoSQL APIs= As MySQL Cluster stores tables in data nodes, rather than in the MySQL Server, there are multiple interfaces available to access the database: * SQL access via the MySQL Server * NoSQL APIs where MySQL Cluster libraries can be embedded into an application to provide direct access to the data nodes without passing through a SQL layer. These include: ** Memcached ** Node.js / JavaScript ** Java and JPA ** HTTP / REST ** NDB API (C++) =MySQL Cluster Manager= Part of the commercial MySQL Cluster CGE, MySQL Cluster Manager is a tool designed to simplify the creation and administration of the MySQL Cluster CGE database by automating common management tasks, including on-line scaling, upgrades, backup/restore and reconfiguration. MySQL Cluster Manager also monitors and automatically recovers MySQL Server application nodes and management nodes, as well as the MySQL Cluster data nodes. Implementation MySQL Cluster uses three different types of nodes (processes) : * Data node (ndbd/ndbmtd process): These nodes store the data. Tables are automatically sharded across the data nodes which also transparently handle load balancing, replication, failover and self-healing. * Management node (ndb_mgmd process): Used for configuration and monitoring of the cluster. They are required only to start or restart a cluster node. They can also be configured as arbitrators, but this is not mandatory (MySQL Servers can be configured as arbitrators instead).Jon Stephens, Mike Kruckenberg, Roland Bouman (2007): \\"MySQL 5.1 Cluster DBA Certification Study Guide\\", pp. 86 * Application node or SQL node (mysqld process): A MySQL server (mysqld) that connects to all of the data nodes in order to perform data storage and retrieval. This node type is optional; it is possible to query data nodes directly via the NDB API, either natively using the C++ API or one of the additional NoSQL APIs described above. Generally, it is expected that each node will run on a separate physical host, VM or cloud instance (although it is very common to co-locate Management Nodes with MySQL Servers). For best practice, it is recommended not to co-locate nodes within the same node group on a single physical host (as that would represent a single point of failure).  Versions  MySQL Cluster version numbers are no longer tied to that of MySQL Server - for example, the most recent version is MySQL Cluster 7.5 even though it is based on/contains the server component from MySQL 5.7. Higher versions of MySQL Cluster include all of the features of lower versions, plus some new features. Older versions (no longer in development): * Ndb included in MySQL 5.1.X source tree * MySQL Cluster 6.2 based on MySQL 5.1.A :First 'telco' or 'carrier grade edition' release.

Early life and career He was educated at the High School of Montreal and Lower Canada College, Montr√©al, completing his secondary education at the age of fifteen. Too young to attend a Canadian university, for four years he travelled and attended courses in France, Britain, and Germany. On his return, he worked as a reporter on the Montreal Star.Rick Helmes-Hayes, Measuring the Mosaic: An Intellectual Biography of John Porter (University of Toronto Press, 2010), p. 181 He was the paper's associate editor, 1937-38, and was editor of its sister paper the Montr√©al Saturday Standard in 1938. He joined the Wartime Information Board in 1942 and was general manager 1944-45. In late 1945, at age 33, he was appointed the first full-time chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Throughout the controversies that arose over the funding and regulation of the new medium of television, Dunton was a persuasive defender of the corporation's independence and a strong advocate of the need to fund publicly a television system. Shortly after the CBC completed its network from coast to coast in July 1958, he resigned and became president of Carleton University. Dunton was widely commended for the tact and intelligence with which he had overseen the development of CBC television. Marc Thibault who directed the News and Public Affairs (1968-1981) at Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada (CBC French Network), built on Davidson Dunton's vision to bring qualitative and quantitative rigour (formative and summative evaluation) in assessing coast- to-coast equity and content impartiality, especially during federal and provincial elections. He was appointed by Prime Minister Lester Pearson co- chairman, (with Andr√© Laurendeau), of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in 1963, which has profoundly influenced federal government language policies. He stepped down as Carleton's president in 1972 to become director of the Institute of Canadian Studies at Carleton (1973‚Äì78) and later fellow of the Institute. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada and received honorary diplomas from seven Canadian universities. The Dunton Tower at Carleton University is named in his honour.

Founded in 1859, the school offers Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Laws (LLM), and Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) degree programs. Michigan Law School consistently ranks among the highest- rated law schools in the United States and the world. In the 2020 U.S. News ranking, Michigan Law is ranked 9th overall. Notable alumni include U.S. Supreme Court Justices Frank Murphy, William Rufus Day, and George Sutherland, as well as a number of heads of state and corporate executives. Approximately 89% of class of 2018 graduates were employed within ten months of graduation; its bar passage rate in 2017 was 92.5%. Michigan Law has placed 41 of its alumni on United States Circuit Courts, over 100 of its graduates on federal trial courts, and 36 of its graduates on the Michigan Supreme Court, including 16 who served as Chief Justice. More than 170 Michigan law graduates have served in the United States Congress, including 20 United States Senators and more than 150 Congressional representatives. Additionally, numerous graduates have served as state legislators. The school has an enrollment of about 920 as well as 81 full-time faculty members (60 tenured and tenure-track and 21 in clinical and legal practice). History University of Michigan Law Building, circa 1910s The Law School was founded in 1859, and quickly rose to national prominence. By 1870, Michigan was the largest law school in the country. In 1870, Gabriel Franklin Hargo graduated from Michigan as the second African- American to graduate from law school in the United States. In 1871 Sarah Killgore, a Michigan Law graduate, became the first woman to both graduate from law school and be admitted to the bar. Although the law school is part of the public University of Michigan, less than 2 percent of the law school's expenses are covered by state funds. The remainder (97‚Äì98% of Michigan Law's budget) is supplied by private gifts, tuition, and endowments. In 2009, Michigan Law began a $102 million enterprise to construct a new law building that would remain loyal to the English Gothic style. The enterprise was fully funded by endowments and private gifts. 2009 also marked the school's sesquicentennial celebration. As a part of the festivities, Chief Justice John Roberts visited the school and participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building. The building was dedicated in 2012 and called South Hall. In December 2018, South Hall was renamed Jeffries Hall. Campus 180px180px 180px 180px The Law Quadrangle is designed in the English Gothic style. Built between 1924 and 1933 by the architectural firm York and Sawyer with funds donated by attorney and alumnus William W. Cook, the Cook Law Quadrangle comprises four buildings: *Hutchins Hall, the main academic building, named for former Dean of the Law School and President of the University, Harry Burns Hutchins *The Legal Research Building. In 2007, the University of Michigan Reading Room was named 94th on a list of \\"American's Favorite Buildings.\\" The building is one of only three law buildings on the list. *John Cook Dormitory *The Lawyer's Club, providing additional dormitory rooms and a meeting space for the residents of the Quad; highlighted by a Great Lounge, and a dining room with a high-vaulted ceiling, an oak floor, and dark oak paneling. In 2012, extensive renovations of the Lawyers Club were undertaken thanks in part to a $20 million gift from Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charles T. Munger, and was re-opened on August 19, 2013 for the Fall 2013 school year. Admissions and rankings Michigan Law was ranked third in the initial U.S. News & World Report law school rankings in 1987. Michigan Law is also one of the \\"T14\\" law schools, schools that have consistently ranked within the top 14 law schools since U.S. News began publishing rankings. In the 2019 U.S. News ranking, Michigan Law is ranked 9th overall. The 2010 Super Lawyers rankings placed Michigan as second. Michigan Law is currently ranked 6th for Clinical Training and 6th for International Law. In a 2011 U.S. News \\"reputational ranking\\" of law schools by hiring partners at the nation's top law firms, the University of Michigan Law School ranked 4th. Michigan Law ranked 15th among U.S. law schools, tied with the Georgetown University Law Center, for the number of times its tenured faculty's published scholarship was highly cited in legal journals during the period 2010 through 2014. Admission to Michigan Law is highly selective. For the class entering in the fall of 2019, 936 out of 5629 applicants (16.63%) were offered admission, with 294 matriculating. The 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles for the 2018 entering class were 165 and 171, respectively, with a median of 169 (top 3.3 percent of test takers). The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.55 and 3.89, respectively, with a median of 3.77. Approximately 97.5 percent of the graduating class of 2017 was employed by nine months after graduation. Approximately 86% of the class of 2017 secured positions as a judicial clerk or in private practice. The majority of Michigan Law grads work in New York, Illinois, California, Washington, D.C., and Michigan. Publications Michigan Law School students publish several law journals in addition to the Michigan Law Review, the sixth oldest legal journal in the U.S. These include: : *University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform *Michigan Journal of International Law *Michigan Journal of Gender and Law *Michigan Journal of Race & Law *Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review *Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law *Michigan Business & Entrepreneurial Law Review, formerly known as the Michigan Journal Private Equity and Venture Capital Law Journal membership is obtained through participation in writing competitions. Moot court competitions Students may compete in intramural moot court competitions, the oldest of which is the Henry M. Campbell Moot Court Competition, established in 1926 and first held in the 1927‚Äì1928 academic year. Other moot court competitions include the Child Welfare Law Moot Court Competition, Criminal Law Moot Court Competition, the Entertainment Media and Arts Moot Court Competition, the Environmental Law Moot Court Competition, the Intellectual Property Moot Court Competition, the Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, the Vis International Arbitration Moot Court, the Native American Law Students Association Competition, the Manfred Lachs Moot Court, Michigan Law Corporate Counseling Competition, and the 1L Oral Advocacy Competition. Clinical programs Michigan Law's clinical program allows students to provide direct representation to clients under the supervision of full-time faculty. There are 18 clinical programs, including the Child Advocacy Law Clinic, the Entrepreneurship Clinic, the Environmental Law Clinic, the Federal Appellate Litigation Clinic, the International Transactions Clinic, the Michigan Innocence Clinic, the Transactional Lab, and the Unemployment Insurance Clinic. Student organizations Michigan Law offers a wide array of student organizations centered around various interest areas, including politics, pro bono work, community service, race, gender, religion, and hobbies. Student organizations organize various annual events, from student pageants such as Mr. Wolverine to the Michigan Law Culture Show. Externships and internships Michigan's externship program is designed to provide students with real-world legal experience and advanced research opportunities beyond what is separately available in either a classroom or a clinic. Externships are available in places such as Switzerland, South Africa, and India. Student Funded Fellowships Student Funded Fellowships (SFF) is a program designed to fund Michigan Law students who accept public interest summer jobs with low pay and to help 1Ls finance the living costs associated with their summer jobs. SFF is governed by a board of law students and operates independently of the Law School. The Board elects its own officers, including two co-chairs, a treasurer, and various committee chairs. Board members head fundraising efforts throughout the year, ranging from Donate a Day's Pay (DADP), in which highly paid law firm summer associates donate a day's salary to SFF, to a grand auction in March that invites bids on various donated items, including sports tickets, meals and activities with faculty members, and art. In the late spring, Board members review applications for summer funding and select a limited number of qualified students for grants. Beginning with the summer of 2016, SFF began offering every 1L an interest- free $4000 loan for their summer expenses that is repaid on a sliding scale depending on how much money they make during their 1L and 2L summers. Employment and cost of attendance According to Michigan's ABA-required employment disclosures, 92% of the graduates of the Class of 2013 were employed or seeking an advanced degree. This includes the 85% of the class who had obtained jobs requiring a J.D. Of the Class of 2013, 49.6% were employed by firms of greater than 100 attorneys\\"Individual School Reports\\" Employmentsummary.abaquestionnaire.org, Accessed July 16, 2014. and 12.0% obtained clerkships. Michigan's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 5.6%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2014 who are unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Tuition at Michigan for the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year is $51,398 for residents of the state of Michigan and $54,398 for non-residents. The estimated cost of living for a Michigan student is $18,030. Assuming no tuition increases, a typical three-year course of study at Michigan therefore costs $208,284 (or $69,428 per year) for residents and $217,434 (or $72,428 per year) for non-residents.\\"Law School Tuition Rates 2014-2015\\" Accessed July 16, 2014.

Captain Swing was described as a hard-working tenant farmer driven to destitution and despair by social and political change in the early 19th century. Swing riots Popular protests by farm workers occurred across agricultural areas of southern England and they had a number of structural causes. The main targets for protesting crowds were landowners/landlords, whose threshing machines they destroyed or dismantled, and whom they petitioned for a rise in wages. They also demanded contributions of food, money, beer, or all three from their victims. Often they sought to enlist local parish officials and occasionally magistrates to raise levels of poor relief as well. Throughout England, 644 rioters were imprisoned, 505 transported to Australia, and 19 were executed.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/politics/g5/ The protests were notable for their discipline and the customary protocols favoured by the crowds, characteristics which were very much part of the tradition of popular protest going back to the eighteenth century. The structural reasons for the Swing \\"riots\\" (or risings) are relatively straightforward: underemployment, low wages, low levels of relief, and competition for winter employment from machinery. For most contemporaries, the riotous but largely bloodless actions of the crowds presented less cause for alarm than the high incidence of arson during the period of Swing (October to December 1830). The burning of ricks was not only more destructive, but much harder to apprehend than the rioters in this heightened atmosphere of tension and hostility. The relationship between arsonists and protesters is difficult to assess ‚Äì although there is little doubt that a relationship existed. Whatever the immediate motivations of the arsonists of 1830 and 1831, their actions undoubtedly gave added strength to the demands of the protesting crowds. Many protestors found sympathy in middle-class radicals who encouraged protesters to spread far from their original sources. Early sentences by magistrates against the rioters, even those who destroyed threshing machines, were fairly light; riots continued into 1831. =Examples of threatening \\"Swing\\" letters= Sir, Your name is down amongst the Black hearts in the Black Book and this is to advise you and the like of you, who are Parson Justasses, to make your wills.

It is a member of the carp family (family Cyprinidae) of order Cypriniformes. It occurs in streams and small rivers throughout the Gila River and San Pedro River systems in Arizona, New Mexico, and Sonora; it is now considered extinct in Mexico. Description Loach minnow has an elongated, compressed body with its size rarely exceeding in length.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 133-135. This species have an olivaceous body, highly blotched with darker pigment. They have dirty-white spots before and behind base of dorsal fin, and on lower and upper sides base of caudal. Breeding males have vivid red-orange markings on bases of fins, body, and lower head. Breeding females become yellow on their fin and lower body. In order to distinguished loach minnow from the similar speckled dace, the loach minnow have whitish spots that are present on the origin and insertion of the dorsal fin as well as on the dorsal and ventral portions of the caudal fin base. Biology Loach minnow are short-lived fishes, depending on their environment and different characteristics of individual population. Spawning is observed to take place from late winter in early summer. Their eggs are deposited on the bottom of flattened rocks, and the number of eggs can range from 5 to more than 250 per rock, with average of 52-63 eggs per rock.Marsh, P.C. 1991.

They prefer moderate to swift current velocity and gravel substrates. This species are opportunistic benthic insectivores, they seek food at the bottom substrate for riffle-dwelling larval ephemeropterans, simuliid, and chironomid dipterans.

The rank is well behaved and helps to define analytic pro-p-groups. The term is named after Heinz Pr√ºfer.  Definition  The Pr√ºfer rank of pro-p-group G is ::sup{d(H)Hleq G} where d(H) is the rank of the abelian group :H/Phi(H), where Phi(H) is the Frattini subgroup of H. As the Frattini subgroup of H can be thought of as the group of non-generating elements of H, it can be seen that d(H) will be equal to the size of any minimal generating set of H.  Properties  Those profinite groups with finite Pr√ºfer rank are more amenable to analysis. Specifically in the case of finitely generated pro-p groups, having finite Pr√ºfer rank is equivalent to having an open normal subgroup that is powerful.

The park is located 1 mile south of Winder and is accessible by Georgia State Route 81. There is a lake with a public beach. Available activities at Fort Yargo include GeoCaching, hiking, mountain biking, disc golf, boating (including Jon boat, pedal boat, and canoe rentals), lake swimming, fishing, picnicking, miniature golf, tennis, and basketball. The park also features a log fort built in 1792 by settlers, for protection against the Creek and Cherokee. The park also hosts Camp Will-A- Way, an accessible camp designed for individuals with developmental disabilities, in partnership with Camp Twin Lakes. History The Creek village known as Snodon was located near what is now Athens and Church streets in Winder. A Creek named Umausauga claimed an area south of Tishmagu, now called Mulberry River. In 1786, three men ‚Äì Abednego Moore, Richard Easley, and Josiah Strong - arrived from Effingham County. They set up camp north of the Mulberry River in hopes of trading beads and cloth. The three men formed a friendship with Umasauga, who allowed the men to purchase some of his land which they called Beadland. The day after the trade nine friends and family joined the three men. They brought four horses, two wagons, four head of cattle, four sheep, six pigs, ten new rifles with powder and shot and tools. The new colony now had eight men and four women, six of whom had fought in the American Revolution. The State of Georgia contracted with the Humphries brothers ‚Äì George, Shadrack, and Uriah, the three sons of Revolutionary War captain and Jackson County delegate to 1798 Georgia Constitutional Convention, Joseph Humpheris ‚Äì to build four forts across Georgia. Fort Yargo was constructed in 1793. Its location was given as three miles SW of \\"Jug Tavern,\\" the original name for Winder. The other three forts are Fort Strong at Talassee, Fort Thomocoggan now Jefferson, and Fort Groaning Rock now Commerce.ibid. In 1810, George Washington Humphrey, an original builder of the Fort, sold Fort Yargo and 121 surrounding acres at auction to John Hill for $167.00.ibid. John Hill and his family lived on the property for a number of years. The family cemetery is located in the Fort Yargo State Park. In the year 1927, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) took on the project to restore and preserve Fort Yargo. Mildred Pledger and the DAR placed a marker on the grounds which was later destroyed. Led by C.O. Maddox, members of the Kiwanis Club and the Lions Club set out to preserve the fort. With the help of Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr. in 1954, were donated to the state. Other lands were acquired to bring the acreage count to . Old Fort Yargo The Fort Yargo building, constructed as part of the original Fort, is an two-story log blockhouse. The logs used to construct the Fort are around 10 inches thick and are joined at the corners by interlocking wedge shaped notches. Portholes are located on the Fort to aide defense. Local citizens and the Fort Yargo Living History Society are working today to restore Fort Yargo and some out buildings.

The boxers are represented by 2D sprites seen from over the shoulder of one of the fighters. The title of the game refers to the famous boxing magazine, The Ring, which the game is licensed to associate itself with. The following famous middleweight boxers are represented in the game: Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Dur√°n, Thomas Hearns, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Rocky Graziano. All of the fights in the game take place in the Las Vegas Hilton casino in the North American version. There are also advertising banners for HBO visible during fights that are not available in the Japanese version. In the Japanese version, the game takes place in a generic boxing ring using the publisher's name in place of the HBO advertisements found in the North American version. A special version was released in Mexico and the American Southwest called Chavez II; the game exchanged the English language words for Spanish and omitted some vocals. Gameplay The skills and attributes of the player. During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches). The fighters' movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'. A scene of one of the boxing matches against Roberto Dur√°n. There are three different modes: 'exhibition', 'career', and 'battle of the legends'. In 'exhibition' mode, a player can choose to fight as any boxer in the game, against any boxer in the game, against either the console or another player. In 'career' mode, a player creates their own boxer, and fights their way through all the boxers in the game, before fighting for the world title. If the player loses once in 'career' mode, he is given a warning that 'game over' would be given for the second loss; giving the player no alternative but to either use a password or start over again with a new boxer. Presentation Each fight is seen from behind and slightly to one side of one of the boxers, so that the player appears to be looking over their shoulder, in the direction of their opponent. In the North American version, the blood is colored red while the Japanese version uses sweat instead. This is contrary to Nintendo's then-current censorship policy that blood should never be used in their games. Between each round, girls in bikinis announce the next round by showing a number around the ring (and to the player).

It is located north of the city of Lethbridge. It claims the title of \\"Livestock Feeding Capital of Canada.\\"  History  Picture Butte received its name from a prominence southeast of town. By 1947, however, the prominence's soil had been reworked and used for street improvements, highway construction and a dyke on the shore of the Picture Butte Lake Reservoir. The prominence no longer exists. Homesteading in the area began in the early 20th century. The building of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation System in 1923 and the CPR rail line in 1925 stimulated an influx of settlers. The first post office opened in 1925. In 1943, Picture Butte became a village, and it attained town status in 1961 with a population of 978. The Canadian Sugar Factory closed in 1978 and resulted in the loss of tax revenues and employment opportunities to the town. Industrial activity consists of small service, warehousing and wholesaling industries. The town annexed approximately in 1991, significantly changing the town's boundary since the general municipal plan of 1980.

History The band was formed in 1987 by Leonardo de Lozanne and Francisco \\"Paco\\" Huidobro, brother of Micky Huidobro of Molotov. The original lineup consisted of Lozanne, Huidobro, bassist Javier 'Ch√°!' Ramirez, keyboardist I√±aki Vazquez, and Gabriel Kuri on drums. Kuri was later replaced by Jorge ‚ÄòChiquis‚Äô Amaro who was followed by multi-instrumentalist Jay de la Cueva, (lead singer of the Mexican glam metal band Moderatto). Fobia was one of the original bands to emerge from the rock en espa√±ol / Rock en tu idioma (Rock in your language) boom of the late 1980s, alongside Caifanes, Man√°, Ne√≥n, Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio and Los Amantes de Lola; all of which followed in the footsteps of Soda Stereo ‚Äì who by the late 1980s had amassed a huge following in the Americas. In December 1987, RCA Ariola de M√©xico held a \\"Rock en tu idioma\\" battle of the bands contest in Mexico City. Fobia was eliminated early on and Los Amantes de Lola went on to win the contest. In spite of their early elimination, executives from Ariola decided to schedule an appointment with Fobia. According to legend, the band missed their meeting with Ariola because they weren't able to enter the building due to problems with security. Following the incident, the band's luck improved. Sa√∫l Hern√°ndez of Caifanes produced their first demos and Ariola eventually signed them.Fobia Fobia's early sound, like many of the genre, was heavily influence by 80's new wave with a few notable exceptions: David Bowie and KISS. Fobia's music has always embraced the fantastic and eccentric and contains large doses of irony and humor. Fobia steered clear of the political and cultural themes that were embraced by their contemporaries. According to Lozanne, \\"I think it was more of a strategy of the record companies. We never felt like we were part of a movement. We didn't dress like the other bands. We didn't sing about the things they were singing about\\".Carey Darling, \\"Mexican rockers rediscover fun as Fobia\\", The Post Gazette, 4/09/2011 The name Fobia was chosen because it described the insecurities, fears, and personal obsessions of the band members. These were transformed into melodies and music, and materialized into their first songs; \\"El microbito\\", \\"La iguana\\" y \\"El crucifijo,\\" which they played in small bars and at house parties.\\"Fobia: Biografia\\", esmas.com, 2012 Fobia's self-titled debut album Fobia cemented their reputation as an innovative and original rock en espa√±ol act. Produced by Marteen, their self- titled album yielded classics such as ‚ÄúEl Microbito,‚Äù ‚ÄúEl Crucifijo,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Iguana.‚Äù In 1990, Fobia toured with Caifanes, Man√°, and Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio as part as a promotional tour for the emerging batch of Mexican rock bands. The following year Fobia released Mundo Feliz (Happy World) which was recorded in Mexico City and at the Power Station in New York City, again with Marteen. Mundo Feliz yielded ‚ÄúCamilla,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEl Diablo.‚Äù The album featured a cameo by Mexican rock/pop diva Alejandra Guzm√°n.\\"Mundo Feliz\\", AllMusic.Com, 2012 In 1993 Fobia release Leche (Milk), a decidedly more experimental album, infusing Latin rhythms and alternative rock. The self-produced album became Fobia's least successful album to date. The lead single, ‚ÄúLos Cibernoides‚Äù (Cybernoids) was a critique of the Mexican media conglomerate Televisa. Regarldess of sales, Leche was a critical success. Leche saw the departure of original drummer Gabriel Kuri.Leche For 1995's Amor Chiquito (Small Love) Fobia enlisted famed Argentine producer and composer Gustavo Santaolalla who had a long string of production credits during the 1990s, producing albums for Mexican acts such as Caf√© Tacuba, Caifanes, Molotov, and Julieta Venegas. The album was mixed by Jim Kerr and Tony Peluso, ex guitarist of The Carpenters.\\"Amor Chiquito\\", AllMusic.Com, 2012 For Amor Chiquito, origingal drummer Gabriel Kuri was replaced by Jorge (Chiquis) Amaro, former drummer of Ne√≥n. Amor Chiquito was a more direct sounding album. The lead single ‚ÄúRevolucion sin Manos‚Äù was a guitar driven 4/4 stomper. Amor put Fobia back on top of the rock en espa√±ol food chain. Fobia toured the U.S. and Latin America. Following the release of the album Kuri was replaced by Jay de la Cueva, currently of Moderatto, who at the time had worked with teen pop group Micro Chips\\"Tributo Microchips\\", Tributo Microchips.com, 2006 and played drums for Las V√≠ctimas del Doctor Cerebro. In 1997 Fobia participated in a Queen tribute album with \\"Under Pressure\\" (\\"Presionando\\"). That same year Fobia released the live album Fobia on Ice. Fobia disbanded in 1997. Reunion In 2004 Fobia reunited and released a greatest hits compilation album titled Wow 87*04. Wow 87*04 was followed by Fobia's fifth studio album Rosa Venus (Venus Rose). To promote the record, Fobia toured the U.S. and Latin America. Following the release of Rosa Venus and the subsequent tour Fobia returned to Mexico City to play a series of shows including an opening slot for the Rolling Stones held at El Foro Sol. To honor their 20th anniversary in 2007 Fobia released XX a compilation of live tracks recorded during their 2005 tour. The album included acoustic versions as well as new arrangements of old songs. This disc was accompanied by a documentary/music video DVD. In April 2011, Fobia gave a rousing performance at the 11th Vive Latino ‚Äì Festival Iberoamericano de Cultura Musical, one of the most important music festivals in Latin America.

That is, it concerns a collection of digital images of preserved plants or plant parts. Virtual herbaria often are established to improve availability of specimens to a wider audience. However, there are digital herbaria that are not suitable for internet access because of the high resolution of scans and resulting large file sizes (several hundred megabytes per file). Additional information about each specimen, such as the location, the collector, and the botanical name are attached to every specimen. Frequently, further details such as related species and growth requirements are mentioned.  Specimen Imaging  The standard hardware used for herbarium specimen imaging is the \\"HerbScan\\" scanner. It is an inverted flat-bed scanner which raises the specimen up to the scanning surface. This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed book scanner or a copy stand to achieve the same effect. A small color chart and a ruler must be included on a herbarium sheet when it is imaged. The JSTOR Plant Science requires that the ruler bears the herbarium name and logo, and that a ColorChecker chart is used for any specimens to be contributed to the Global Plants Initiative (GPI).  Uses  Virtual herbaria are established in part to increase the longevity of specimens. Major herbaria participate in international loan programs, where a researcher can request specimens to be shipped in for study. This shipping contributes to the wear and tear of specimens. If, however, digital images are available, images of the specimens can be sent electronically. These images may be a sufficient substitute for the specimens themselves, or alternatively, the researcher can use the images to \\"preview\\" the specimens, to which ones should be sent out for further study. This process cuts down on the shipping, and thus the wear and tear of the specimens, as well as the wait times associated with shipping. Virtual herbaria can also be used to increase public awareness of herbaria. Some herbaria make their specimen databases publicly available on the Internet. Digital images of specimens can be added to these databases to allow the public to further engage with the material. Some herbaria also capitalize on their images by selling herbarium prints and greeting cards featuring particularly attractive specimens.

It is considered the principal percussion instrument of Persian music. The tombak is normally positioned diagonally across the torso while the player uses one or more fingers and/or the palm(s) of the hand(s) on the drumhead, often (for a ringing timbre) near the drumhead's edge. Sometimes tombak players wear metal finger rings for an extra-percussive \\"click\\" on the drum's shell. Tombak virtuosi perform solos lasting ten minutes or more. The tombak had been used to create a goblet drum. Description Hossein Tehrani is known as a pioneer of playing the tombak in 20th century Persian music. The tombak is a single-headed goblet drum about 43 cm in height with a 28 cm diameter head. Its shell is carved from a single block of (sometimes highly figured, knotted or marbled) wood, maybe with a carved design or geometric pattern (such as furrows, flutes, diamonds and/or spirals‚Äîit is often a costly, heirloom-type or vintage musical instrument). At the bottom the shell is somewhat thicker than at the top for strength (since the drumhead adds to the strength at the top). The shell's wall thickness is approximately 2 cm. The throat is nearly cylindrical and connects the top (body) cavity to the hollow base (the throat itself, the interior of which forms the small opening). A sheepskin or goatskin head is stretched and secured with glue, tacks or both. The fairly wide top opening permits full bass tone as well as various treble tones (see below). Tombaks with adjustable tuning have been produced experimentally but the head tension is normally fixed prior to performance with careful attention to the temperature and humidity. The player may heat or cool or dampen or dry the membrane to reach a desired fundamental pitch. The pitch can be raised somewhat during a performance by applying finger pressure but a variety of tapping and clicking timbres reduce overall focus on the drum's pitch. Typically, two or three clearly contrasting timbres (through varying finger placement or clacking of a ring against the drum shell) are played in an antiphonal style. Goblet-shaped drums are played in different regions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Although similarities exist among all goblet drums, the techniques for playing the tombak are different from most other goblet drums. The modern tombak described in this page is most closely associated with the music of Iran. The tombak was not considered a virtuoso solo instrument until the pioneering work of Hossein Tehrani in the 1950s, as well as innovations of Nasser Farhangfar and others. Modern tombak players are exponentially expanding the techniques used in playing the instrument. The Tombak was not considered a solo instrument until the pioneering work of Hossein Tehrani (1912-1973) in the 1950s . His pupils included Mohammad Esmaili (1934), Jahangir Malek (1931 - ), Jamshid Chemirani (1942 -), Amir Nasser Eftetah ( 1925-1977 ), renowned teacher whose disciple Bahman Rajabi, develop modern technology . Farhangfar Nasser (1947-1997) revolutionized the principles of accompaniment, often away much of the melody without ever interfering, he drew on many styles of play of Zarb-e zourkh√¢n√© (especially that of Morshed Moradi) that accompanies Varzesh-e Pahlavani (), traditional martial gymnastics practiced in Zurkhaneh (\\"house of strength\\") and motrebs (popular musicians playing accents in a particular way). His knowledge of poetry and a clear and powerful voice make an improviser and especially an outstanding accompanist, always anticipating phrases soloist. Very few players assimilate his art.

History In 1955, the Florida Legislature established the Jacksonville Expressway Authority. Their responsibility was limited to highways, bridges and tolls in Duval County until 1971, when the Jacksonville Transportation Authority was formed by a merger of the Jacksonville Expressway Authority with several private bus companies. Governance The JTA is governed by a seven- member Board of Directors. The mayor of Jacksonville appoints three members who must be confirmed by the Jacksonville City Council; the Florida Governor appoints three members who must be confirmed by the Florida Senate. Each member serves a four-year, unpaid term and can be re-appointed for a second term. If a member serves eight consecutive years, they must rotate off the board. From its membership, the Board elects its own Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer for one year terms. The seventh member is the District Two Secretary from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) who serves as long as s/he is employed in the position. That individual is responsible for the FDOT activities within the 18 counties of the district, including administrative, planning and operations.\\"Board of Directors\\" Jacksonville Transportation Authority website As of February 2016, members included Scott McCaleb, chairman; Isaiah Rumlin, vice chairman; Kevin Holzendorf, secretary; Ari Jolly, treasurer; Greg Evans, FDOT District Two Secretary; Denise Wallace, board member; and Jeanne Miller, board member. Revenue Originally, when a bridge or roadway was completed, a toll was imposed at that location to create a revenue stream to repay bonds used to fund construction. State and federal tax money was used for specific capital projects, such as interstate highways. =Gas surcharge= The Jacksonville City Council approved a 10-year, 6¬¢ per gallon gasoline surcharge in 1986 to pay for new roadways and other transportation projects. Prior to its expiration in 1996, the council extended the tax for 20 additional years, until 2016.Hannan, Larry: \\"JTA to ask council for gas tax increase and extension\\" Florida Times-Union, June 5, 2010 =Tolls= J. Turner Butler Boulevard, the Fuller Warren Bridge, Mathews Bridge, Hart Bridge and Trout River Bridge were tolled by JTA until 1988, when Jacksonville voters approved a ¬Ω¬¢ sales tax increase to pay off the toll bonds, fund future road construction, and abolish toll collections. =Growth management= JTA was the major beneficiary of the $2.25 billion Better Jacksonville Plan (BJP), passed by voters in September, 2000. Roadway/drainage improvements, resurfacing, new sidewalks and railroad grade crossings accounted for $1.5 billion, of which half was funded by the BJP ¬Ω¬¢ sales tax increase and half from the existing gasoline surcharge.\\"ROADS/INFRASTRUCTURE/TRANSPORTATION\\" City of Jacksonville, Better Jacksonville Plan In 2005, the JTA and city re-prioritized the projects still outstanding. The actual cost for most projects had significantly exceeded the estimate due to an 18-month lag time and an unanticipated increase in the price of construction materials. Dozens of projects were deferred to the future and removed from the BJP or left on a $320 million list of unfunded tasks.\\"Unfunded Better Jacksonville Plan road projects\\" Florida Times-Union, May 7, 2009 =Budget= The gasoline surcharge generates approximately $30 million in revenue each year, about one third of JTA's budget of $100 million in 2010. Prior to the 1986 gasoline surcharge, tolls were the primary source of local revenue for the JTA. Federal and state highway money provided the balance. In early June, 2010, JTA announced their intentions to request an extension of the 6¬¢ per gallon gasoline surcharge, due to expire in 2016. They will also ask the council for an additional 5¬¢ per gallon tax over 30 years that would generate another $25 million per year, for a total of $55 million each year. Most council members questioned the need to extend the existing tax and were opposed to any new tax during difficult economic times, but JTA executives warned that if the gas taxes are curtailed, no road construction will occur and bus service will be slashed. Responsibilities The goal of the JTA is to improve the flow of traffic into and throughout Jacksonville/Duval County. =Roadway infrastructure= The JTA develops and implements construction and financing plans for state and city roads, bridges and interchanges in conjunction with the city government and the Florida Department of Transportation.

It is currently in the planning stages, having completed the first step of a feasibility study and currently pursuing an alternatives analysis. Three routes were analyzed in depth, north to Yulee, FL, southwest to Green Cove Springs, FL and the southeast to St. Augustine, FL. A feasibility study was completed in November 2009 for the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA). James Boyle, JTA's regional transportation planner, has since said that there are no fatal flaws in the study. JTA hired a consultant to conduct a feasibility study in early 2008 at the cost of $400,000. It was completed in November 2009. The study looked into 7 routes, most along existing freight rail right of ways. Three of these, north to Yulee, FL, southwest to Green Cove Springs, FL and the southeast to St. Augustine, FL were selected for in depth study. In the Summer of 2010, JTA allocated $1 Million for an Alternative Analysis study on the proposed system. This is required step to participate in the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) New Starts program. In May 2013, St. Augustine City Commission voted in a resolution supporting the proposal of a commuter train service on the southeast corridor. JTA says that the federal government could fund half of southeast corridor project, estimated to cost about $193.3 million. The proposal still needs approval from St. Johns County, The North Florida Transportation Planning Organization board and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority board. As of 2018, First Coast Commuter Rail is still in the planning stages and no funding has been identified for its implementation. thumb All routes in the in-depth study start in downtown Jacksonville and head out in one of three directions, North, Southwest and Southeast. The North Corridor originates in Downtown Jacksonville, and heads North along the abandoned S-Line to the CSX Kingsland division line to Yulee, FL. The Kingsland division line is a remnant of the Seaboard Air Line's mainline. The route passes two miles (3 km) from Jacksonville International Airport. The Southwest Corridor originates in Downtown Jacksonville, and heads South along the CSX A-Line to Green Cove Springs, FL. The Southeast Corridor originates in Downtown Jacksonville, and heads Southeast along the Florida East Coast Railway's main line to St. Augustine, FL. The proposed route is the northernmost part of a freight rail line to Miami. The corridor already serves 17 regularly scheduled interregional freight trains a day. The 2009 feasibility study estimated that this route could carry an estimated 5,132 riders in 2015 and 5,469 by 2020 on trains between Jacksonville and St. Augustine. Travel time is estimated at 51 minutes end to end. Notable proposed stops along the route include Palencia, The Northeast Florida Regional Airport, the St. Johns County Complex, downtown St. Augustine, West Augustine, Race Track Road, Avenues and JTB.

It was originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and later ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy. The Ultimate Team is a crossover of both Technos Japan's Double Dragon and Rare's own Battletoads game franchises, although Technos had little or no credited involvement in the production of the game outside of the Double Dragon license. The game features the characters from the Double Dragon series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, two young martial arts experts; also included are the three humanoid toad protagonists from the Battletoads game. It is also the first Battletoads game to feature all three toads as playable characters. The game's engine and design are directly based upon the Battletoads series.  Gameplay and premise  A gameplay screenshot of the SNES version, showing the Battletoad Pimple fighting against the Double Dragon boss character Roper (Willy) Battletoads/Double Dragon consists of three play modes: a single-player, a \\"2 Players A\\" mode where the players can hit each other, and a \\"2 Players B\\" that doesn't have that. It uses the engine of the original Battletoads game, and its gameplay sides more with the Rare-developed product than Double Dragon. Like the prior Battletoads installment, there are only three continues and no password system, and in the two-player modes, if one player loses all lives, both players have to start a level over. Since the 16-bit ports are identical in gameplay to their NES counterparts, attacks and jumping are triggered by two buttons on their respective controllers. After being defeated by the Battletoads, the evil Dark Queen flees to the outer reaches of the universe and the 'Toads and their mentor get on with their lives. However, one day the Earth's military is neutralized and a giant spaceship called Colossus emerges from the moon. Apparently, the Dark Queen is back with another plan to dominate the galaxy, and she has allied herself with the Shadow Warriors (from the Double Dragon series) to supplement her forces. Deciding to even the odds, the Battletoads get in contact with Billy and Jimmy Lee and ask them for their help. The brothers agree, and all five immediately take off for the Colossus in a mission to stop this two-pronged threat. The first level of the seven- level game takes place on the tail of Colossus, the second on the interior corridors of the ship in level two, the third in the ship's base, and the fourth where the player attempts to destroy the ship from the outside while on a small space craft. The fourth level is where the beat 'em up game turns into a shooter, and the Dark Queen throws asteroids, mines, and UFOs at the spacecraft controlled by the player. Although the ship is successfully destroyed, the Dark Queen and the Shadow Queen survive by escaping in a missile hull, thus making the fifth level's goal to board it. The final two stages are boss battles with the Shadow Boss (stage six) and the Dark Queen (stage seven). The player has a choice of five playable characters: Billy and Jimmy Lee from Double Dragon, and Zitz, Pimple and Rash from Battletoads. All of the toads are equipped with their usual \\"Smash Hit\\" attacks, such as big punches (\\"Kiss-My-Fist\\"), big kicks (\\"Big Bad Foot\\"), double-handed hits (\\"Nuclear Knuckles\\"), headbutt (\\"Battletoad Butt\\"), a wrecking-ball-like charge used while hanging on a cable (\\"BT Bashing Ball\\"), kicks done while hanging on a rope (\\"Swingin' Size Thirteens\\"), a pick-up and throwing of enemies (\\"Take Out the Trash\\"), backward kicks done while riding a speeder bike (\\"Bikin' Bash\\"), walker leg bashes (\\"No Way Back Thwack\\"), and enemy slamming (\\"Twin Side Slam\\"), with a new attack being a kick while hanging on a ledge named \\"Back 'N Front Punt.\\" Likewise, the Lee twins' Dragon Force techniques are playable in the crossover, such as spin kick, knee drops, and elbow-drops done while jumping (\\"Twistin' Typhoon Kick,\\" \\"Thunderin' Typhoon Kick,\\" and \\"Earthquake Elbow Smash\\" respectively), flying Dragon kicks, fast- spinning attacks (\\"Whizzin' Whirlwind\\"), smashes of enemies against surfaces (\\"Side Wall Smash\\"), \\"Nose-Crunching\\" kneesup, and enemy throws from the enemy's back (Dragon's Tail Throw), and the twins can also perform the same Bakin's Bashes, walker leg strikes, and enemy pick-up-and-throws as the toads. New abilities include hanging off of and moving across sides of platforms, and kicking off enemies while doing so, although the player can fall off and lose a life if other enemies step on his fingers. In addition to the three titular toads, Billy and Jimmy, and the two main villains, there are other characters that previously appeared in prior Battletoads or Double Dragons titles that are in the crossover game, such as the first level boss Abobo, the Rat Pack chief Big Blag who is the second level boss, a gun-wielding Roper who is boss of level three, Robo-Manus who is the fifth level boss, Battletoads enemies such as ravens, walkers, General Slaughter, Scuzz, and retro blasters, and Double Dragons enemies including Linda Lash and Lopar. Like the first Battletoads, the crossover also has a speeder bike section at the end of stage two, where the player dodges big blue \\"Drums\\" and jumps over \\"Post Walls\\". As walkers are a returning enemy, their legs can once again be used as enemies. A Turbo Rope is used in the third stage and is like the Turbo Cable from the first game; however, unlike the Cable, the player can use the Rope in the level's horizontal-scrolling sections by attaching it to ceilings through B-button presses in order to get from platform to platform. An item in Battletoads/Double Dragon not seen in prior installments of both franchises are \\"Bonus Pods\\" that each consists of either points, energy, a weapon, or an extra life, although like the first Battletoads, garnering 100,000 points (and 200,000 points each after reaching 100,000) is another method of obtaining lives. Enemies that only appear in Battletoads/Double Dragon include the dumb but rough Guido, a cowardly, dynamite-throwing \\"Doorman of Doom\\" the player faces in the corridors, the grenade-throwing \\"Windowman of Dooo\\" who is the Doorman's brother and fought in the fifth stage, a \\"Shadow Marine\\" of \\"mindless morons\\" guarding the ship on its tail, Ryders in the second level's speed-biking section, Buzz Discs on the walls of the ship's interior that lets out 10,000 volts of energy, and Securi-cams encountered throughout the Colossuss base that shoot high-powered blasts if something is in its lens.  Development and release  Battletoads/Double Dragon was developed by the company that handled the 1991 Battletoads game, Rare, which produced several games as contract work for other intellectual properties in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the 1993 crossover was one of them, and its development involved Rare receiving little feedback from the owners of the Double Dragon license. The initial NES version of the game features 3D scrolling and other advanced special effects not commonly found on the console. The Game Boy version is similar to the NES version, but it is only for one player. The sprites are the same size although the screen is smaller (leaving less room for movement) and the 3D effects were removed. The logo on the game cover art was one of Rare's first dive into 3D graphics. The later Genesis and Super NES versions of the game are quite similar. Some differences being that the SNES version has better graphics and higher quality sound, while the Sega version features more music tracks, has sharper sprites for the 'toads, and more comical reactions from the characters and from defeated enemies, as well as blood from said enemies' post-defeat portraits. Reception = Contemporaneous = Nintendo Power asserted that, despite the confusing depth perception, \\"great action, graphics and theme make this one of the strongest titles this year,\\" going as so far to proclaim it as better than Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (1993). Its staff rated it as the second-best NES game of 1993.The Top Titles of 1993, Nintendo Power 56 (January 1994), p. 80. The NES version was also nominated for Nintendo Power Awards 1993 in the categories \\"Graphics & Sound\\", \\"Theme & Fun\\", \\"Play Control\\", \\"Villain\\" (The Dark Queen) and \\"The Best Overall Game\\".The Nintendo Power Awards 1993 nominations, Nintendo Power, 58 (March 1994) p. 97 Electronic Gaming Monthlys Steve Harris, reviewing the NES version, loved its \\"side-scrolling techniques,\\" \\"nice\\" attack combos, and combination of game licenses, but found the graphics too average even for an 8-bit title and the controls \\"slightly haphazard.\\" Another critic from GamePro disappointed with the NES game's graphics enjoyed the character animation, particularly when it came to the bosses and the playable characters' attacks; however, he also criticized the cutscenes and level designs, for replacing the \\"pizazz\\" and vibrant colors of the previous Battletoads installment with \\"a flat, 2D appearance and almost robotic animation,\\" also reporting problems of disappearing sprites during \\"hectic fighting scenes.\\" Other reviews, such as another Electronic Gaming Monthly critic, Martin Alessi and Mike Weigand of Electronic Games, found the visuals amazing for an 8-bit title, citing its parallax scrolling effects. Critics from GameFan called the SNES port superior to the Genesis version for its better presentation, specifically when it came to color, detail, effects, and sound. Alessi, Weigand and Ed Semrad praised the two-player mode, attacks, moves, and fast-paced gameplay. Weigand praised the challenging gameplay and noted aspects of it that make it more forgiving that the previous Battletoads game, such as not having to re-do the speed bike section if the player falls off a bike. Sushi-X, however, brought up unfair elements to the difficulty, such as \\"enormously cheap kills in many areas, like being knocked into pits and unblock-able attacks.\\" Mega Fun, reviewing the Gameboy version, stated that it benefitted from diversity when it came to playable characters, enemies, and backgrounds but lacked the \\"unusual\\" elements of other Battletoads games. Reviews of the Gameboy version frequently critiqued the graphics and music; Mega Fan criticized the small sprites for not giving the player a clear perspective of what is going on sometimes, and Michael Koczy of the German edition of Total! wrote the game had \\"poor animation,\\" \\"average\\" music, and toads that were hard to distinguish between each other. The small sprite size was also critiqued for the SNES version when reviewed by a GameFan writer nicknamed \\"Mr. Goo.\\" A GameFan reviewer was critical of the inclusion of Double Dragon characters, reasoning that the franchise was past its prime. = Restrospective = The visuals were praised, common highlights including the humorous animations, especially when it came to the attacks, and vibrant colors. Sega-16s Vince Thornburg stated the character selection screen is \\"a surreal experience that still slightly lingers to this day,\\" and that the \\"enemies are nicely detailed, along with the characters profiles actually having elements of shading and personality instead of just being blinking, talking portraits in a little box.\\" He also wrote the soundtrack was \\"full of catchy tunes which really set the tone,\\" highlighting the first level theme. Matt Hull of Hardcore Gaming 101, reviewing the NES version, praised the humor of the moves and sound effects, \\"superb\\" music, \\"very smooth\\" controls, and for having the same 16-bit-looking graphics as the prior Battletoads game, particularly when it came to the animation, backgrounds, parallax scrolling, and the Colossus: \\"You'll see parts of the spaceship moving and it just looks so fluid/smooth that I can't believe that it's 8 bit!\\" The Video Game Critic favorably called the stages \\"fully interactive and full of surprises.\\" While Hull appreciated its more forgiving difficulty in comparison to the originalBattletoads, Thornburg stated it was still unfair at times, noting \\"unbalanced fights,\\" \\"moving down a rope too fast for the screen and being killed by seemingly nothing or being overcrowded by enemies at the most frustrated moments.\\" Jason Venter felt the slower speed and less hazardous obstacles of the bike section made it less fun that that of the prior Battletoads game, the unnatural movements of the playable characters and \\"inconvenient\\" enemy placements led to cheap deaths, and the bosses were so overpowering they \\"often can brutalize you from a safe distance\\" and \\"getting in close for an attack is frustrating.\\" The two-player mode was positively commented on, with some critics claiming the game to be less enjoyable on single-player. Marc Golding of Honest Gamers noting that two-player options where both players can choose their characters were uncommon in other 16-bit arcade games of a similar style. Thornburg, however, was annoyed by having to start over a level if only one player loses a continue. The combination of the Battletoads and Double Dragon properties were well-received, with Skyler Miller of AllGame opining that \\"Rare does a fine job at connecting the two universes without making it seem forced or arbitrary.\\" Thornburg was amused by the ability to use moves and attacks the toads usually use as Double Dragon characters: \\"While it seems Billy or Jimmy suddenly sprouting giant limbs or at least acting suddenly superhuman to take down a foe seems odd in a Double Dragon game, in the cross-overs universe, it all fits.\\" However, some reviewers brought up problems in presenting the Double Dragon property, such as Double Dragon IIs Burnov being the Shadow Boss instead of Jimmy and Roper being misnamed. Golding criticized how Jimmy and Billy felt \\"just there,\\" with none of the presentation tipping a hat to the Double Dragon franchise, and also wrote that the \\"decidedly bland outer space environs\\" made both the Double Dragon and Battletoads made characters from both properties feel out of place: \\"The result is that both the Dragons and the Toads seem quite out of place in front of the cardboard, uninspired backdrops and the Dragons especially seem to be wasting their celebrity on a game that is tilted toward the cartoonish personality of the Toads.\\" An AllGame critic, Brett Alan Weiss, was harsh on the SNES version, calling it \\"an unnecessary creation, except to line the pockets of the companies involved,\\" and too similar in looks and gameplay to its 8-bit counterpart, thus not taking enough advantage of the 16-bit console's capabilities. His other criticisms were the \\"slow\\" controls, \\"jerky\\" character movements, and poor audio, writing that \\"the sound effects are boring and the music is of the pseudo rock 'n' roll variety, replete with drum machine-sounding drums and thoroughly unconvincing guitar riffs.\\" Golding, in his review of the Genesis port, also panned it for looking too similar to the NES version and missing the \\"atmosphere\\" and better graphics of another 16-bit Battletoads title, Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (1993). The game was featured on the lists of top 11 video game crossovers\\" by UGO Networks and the 15 most bizarre crossovers in gaming by GamesRadar. It has been ranked the 76th best NES game by IGN and the second best Double Dragon game by Cinema Blend, calling it \\"one of the most memorable beat-'em-up games of all time, one of the most iconic crossovers of all time, and one of the best SNES games of all time. Battletoads & Double Dragon was easily one of the most defining games of the 16-bit era, featuring a great sense of scale and scope while including some unforgettable moments, like the hover bike sequence. Having the Battletoads duke it out alongside the Double Dragon was a surreal moment in gaming, but that didn't stop the game from being hard as nails, but that was all part of the 16-bit charm.

It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.See Church of the Resurrection Its prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature.\\"Before the erection of Adelaide House, to approach the City from Southwark was to enjoy as fine a sight as any in London. In the foreground were the ships in the Pool ... while the morning light glinted upon the glorious tower of Wren's church of St Magnus the Martyr, the Customs House and the golden flames of the Monument.\\" 'The Times', 8 November 1927 In Oliver Twist Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, \\"the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom\\". The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S.

Spurr notes that St Magnus \\"was one of the leading shrines of the Anglo-Catholic movement and it is very notable that Eliot should not only refer to it, but, in the midst of a poem of almost unrelieved negativity, present it so positively (if somewhat uncomprehendingly) in terms of the exquisite beauty of its interior: its ‚ÄòInexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold‚Äô (the liturgical colours, we should note, of Eastertide and resurrection, a concept otherwise denied repeatedly throughout The Waste Land)\\". One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its \\"splendour\\"; later he appreciated its \\"utility\\" when he came there as a sinner.Eliot's Early Years, Gordon, L.: Oxford, 1978 Dedication St Magnus Kirk, Egilsay The church is dedicated to St Magnus the Martyr, earl of Orkney, who died on 16 April in or around 1116 (the precise year is unknown).The Relics of St Magnus at Orkneyjar He was executed on the island of Egilsay having been captured during a power struggle with his cousin, a political rival.Orkneyinga Saga: The History of the Earls of Orkney: Penguin Classics, new ed. 2004 . The Saga relates how Magnus Erlendsson, son of Erlend Thorfinnsson, accompanied King Magnus Barelegs of Norway (grandson of Harald Hardrada) during his Irish Sea Campaign of 1098, but refused to take part in the Battle of Anglesey Sound (or Menai Strait) against the Norman Earl of Chester and Earl of Shrewsbury and sang from a psalter in the midst of the fighting. As a consequence he was obliged to go into exile until after the death of King Magnus Barelegs in 1103, but was made joint Earl of Orkney with his cousin Hakon Paulsson by King Eystein Magnusson. The Irish Sea Campaign of 1098, which established the King's direct overlordship of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles including fortifications on St. Patrick's Isle near Peel, Isle of Man (see The Peel Castle Dig, Freke, D.: Douglas, 1995 ), is also described in The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys (available at Chronicle) and in √Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas√∂gum (available at √Ågrip). Magnus had a reputation for piety and gentleness and was canonised in 1135. St. Ronald, the son of Magnus's sister Gunhild Erlendsdotter, became Earl of Orkney in 1136 and in 1137 initiated the construction of St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall.A Latin hymn celebrating the saint ('Nobilis, humilis, Magne martyr') survives from soon after the construction of the cathedral; see St Magnus Hymn. For a detailed study of the cult see St Magnus of Orkney: A Scandinavian Martyr-Cult in Context, Antonsson, H.: Brill, Leiden, 2007 The story of St. Magnus has been retold in the 20th century in the chamber opera The Martyrdom of St Magnus (1976)See The Martyrdom of St Magnus by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, based on George Mackay Brown's novel Magnus (1973). St Magnus of Orkney The identity of the St Magnus referred to in the church's dedication was only confirmed by the Bishop of London in 1926.Letter dated 11 March 1926, original filed in the Registry of the Diocese of London Following this decision a patronal festival service was held on 16 April 1926.The circumstances of the dedication are described in The Times, 15 April 1926, p. 11. An exhibition relating to the history of the church was held in the following month: The Times, 31 May 1926, p. 21 The 900th anniversary of the death of St Magnus was marked with a Pontifical High Mass and Solemn Pontifical Vespers on 16 April 2016,900th Anniversary of Martyrdom, parish news sheet, April 2016 but in 2017 at St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney. In the 13th century the patronage was attributed to one of the several saints by the name of Magnus who share a feast day on 19 August such as St Magnus of Anagni, bishop and martyr.The present Anagni Cathedral was commissioned by Bishop St Peter of Salerno in 1072, who was assigned the task by St Magnus in a vision, and completed in 1104. See Anagni Cathedral and Visit to Anagni. The only English Pope, Adrian IV, died at Anagni in 1159. The relics of St Magnus of Anagni are now in the church of St Martin of Tours, Louisville, Kentucky; see Roman Martyrs and St. Martin of Tours relics. However, Sabine-Gould's 'Lives of the Saints' concluded that: It can hardly be doubted that S. Magnus, Bishop and Martyr, has been manufactured by the blunders of martyrologists. S. Andrew the Tribune is commemorated in ... Latin [as] \\"Magnus Martyr\\". In the early Latin lists, on 19 August, was accordingly inscribed \\"Andreas Tribunus, Magnus Martyr\\". This was read as if there were two Saints, Andrew the Tribune, and Magnus the Martyr. However, by the early 18th century it was suggested that the church was either \\"dedicated to the memory of St Magnus or Magnes, who suffer'd under the Emperor Aurelian in 276 [see St Mammes of Caesarea, feast day 17 August], or else to a person of that name, who was the famous Apostle or Bishop of the Orcades.\\"Remarks on London, being an Exact Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster, Borough of Southwark, and the Suburbs and Liberties, Stow, W.: London, 1722 For the next century historians followed the suggestion that the church was dedicated to the Roman saint of C√¶sarea.\\"At the north east corner of London bridge, stands the parish church of St. Magnus, so named from its dedication to St. Magnus, who suffered martyrdom under the emperor Aurelian, in the city of C√¶sarea, for the christian religion\\" ‚Äì A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark, Noorthouck, J.: London, 1773. \\"There appears to have been several martyrs bearing the name of Magnus.

The famous Danish archaeologist Professor Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae (1821‚Äì85) promoted the attribution to St Magnus of Orkney during his visit to the British Isles in 1846-7, when he was formulating the concept of the 'Viking Age',An Encyclopedia of London, Kent, W. (ed.): London, 1937 and a history of London written in 1901 concluded that \\"the Danes, on their second invasion ... added at least two churches with Danish names, Olaf and Magnus\\".Mediaeval London, Benham, W. and Welch, C.: London, 1901 A guide to the City Churches published in 1917 reverted to the view that St Magnus was dedicated to a martyr of the third century,The City Churches, Taeor, M.E.: London, 1917 but the discovery of St Magnus of Orkney's relics in 1919 renewed interest in a Scandinavian patron and this connection was encouraged by the Rector who arrived in 1921.The Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia was founded in 1912 by Canon William Perry French Morris ‚Äì see Australian Dictionary of Biography ‚Äì and dedicated to St Magnus of Orkney, but this appears to have been due to Canon Morris's support for the notion of 'muscular Christianity' rather than to any links with churches dedicated to St Magnus. History =11th and 12th centuries: foundation= Piling from the Roman river wall dating to about AD 75 A metropolitan bishop of London attended the Council of Arles in 314, which indicates that there must have been a Christian community in Londinium by this date, and it has been suggested that a large aisled building excavated in 1993 near Tower Hill can be compared with the 4th-century Cathedral of St Tecla in Milan.See Museum of London However, there is no archaeological evidence to suggest that any of the mediaeval churches in the City of London had a Roman foundation.Charters of St Paul's, London (Anglo-Saxon Charters), Kelly, S.E. (ed.), Pp 3‚Äì4: Oxford, 2004 . An item relating to the worship of Cybele, the 'Magna Mater', has been found in the River Thames near London Bridge (see Cybele), but there is no evidence that St Magnus Martyr derived from a 'sedes Magna Mater'. A grant from William I in 1067 to Westminster Abbey, which refers to the stone church of St Magnus near the bridge (\\"lapidee eccle sci magni prope pontem\\"), is generally accepted to be a 12th-century forgery,BL Cotton Charter VI 3; see Westminster Abbey Charters, 1066 ‚Äì c.1214, London Record Society 25, Mason, E.

Nonetheless, these manuscripts may preserve valid evidence of a date of foundation in the 11th century.Proposed demolition of nineteen city churches. Report by the clerk of the council and the architect of the council, London County Council, p. 14: London, 1920. As it is unlikely that the original dedication was to St Magnus of Orkney, the date of that saint's death cannot be used as a terminus post quem for the foundation of the church as suggested in The Medieval Church dedications of the City of London, Oxley, J., LAMAS 29: 1978. Parish and ward map Archaeological evidence suggests that the area of the bridgehead was not occupied from the early 5th century until the early 10th century. Environmental evidence indicates that the area was waste ground during this period, colonised by elder and nettles. Following Alfred the Great's decision to reoccupy the walled area of London in 886, new harbours were established at Queenhithe and Billingsgate. A bridge was in place by the early 11th century, a factor which would have encouraged the occupation of the bridgehead by craftsmen and traders.See Current archaeological work at Regis House in the City of London (part 2) by Trevor Brigham and Bruce Watson at Regis House and Figure 182 Location map of London sites at Archaeological Sites A lane connecting Botolph's Wharf and Billingsgate to the rebuilt bridge may have developed by the mid-11th century. The waterfront at this time was a hive of activity, with the construction of embankments sloping down from the riverside wall to the river. Thames Street appeared in the second half of the 11th century immediately behind (north of) the old Roman riverside wall and in 1931 a piling from this was discovered during the excavation of the foundations of a nearby building. It now stands at the base of the church tower.The plaque attached to the timber reads \\"From Roman wharf, AD 75: found Fish Street Hill, 1931\\" St Magnus was built to the south of Thames Street to serve the growing population of the bridgehead areaAspects of Saxo-Norman London III: The Bridgehead and Billingsgate to 1200, Steedman, K., Dyson T., Schofield, J., p. 136: London, 1992, and was certainly in existence by 1128‚Äì33.Gazetteer, Carlin, M. and Belcher, V. in British atlas of historic towns: Vol. 3, The City of London, Lobel, M.D. (ed.): Oxford, 1989, quoting Regesta Regum Anglo- Normannorum, 1066‚Äì1154, Vol. 2, No. 1883: Oxford, 1913.

Brooke and G Keir: \\"Although related to existing property boundaries, there is no evidence that ... parish boundaries followed existing tenurial units, and it is notable that a crossroads stands at the centre of most parishes.\\" He also notes that \\"From the late 11th century legislation on the payment of tithe, which provided the churches' main income ... made it increasingly important to define the exact area over which a church had rights.\\" See Map of London parishes. The mediaeval parish also included Drinkwater's Wharf (named after the owner, Thomas Drinkwater), which was located immediately West of the bridge, and Fish Wharf, which was to the south of the church. The latter was of considerable importance as the fishmongers had their shops on the wharf. The tenement was devised by Andrew Hunte to the Rector and Churchwardens in 1446.A Dictionary of London, Harben, H.A.: London, 1918 The ancient parish was situated in the South East part of Bridge Ward, which had evolved in the 11th century between the embankments to either side of the bridge.Aspects of Saxo-Norman London III: The Bridgehead and Billingsgate to 1200, Steedman, K., Dyson T., Schofield, J., pp. 95 and 104: London, 1992, In the second half of the 12th century control of the advowson of St Magnus was disputed between the Abbot of Westminster and the Prior of Bermondsey.

Martyrdom of Thomas Becket Until 1831 the bridge was aligned with Fish Street Hill, so the main entrance into the City from the south passed the West door of St Magnus on the north bank of the river.This view was the subject of a great number of paintings and prints; see, for example, Turner and Science & Society The bridge included a chapel dedicated to St Thomas Becket\\"Capella beati Thomae Martyris super Pontem\\" in a list of London benefices in Lib. Cust. I. 228, 31 Ed. I. It had an entrance from the river as well as from the street and was reached by a winding staircase. It had a groined roof springing from clustered pillars (Gent. Mag. Lib.

It was 60 ft. long, 20 ft. wide and 110 ft. high, with an undercroft or vaulted crypt. for the use of pilgrims journeying to Canterbury Cathedral to visit his tomb.Chronicles of London Bridge by an Antiquary, Richard Thomson, p. 83 et seq.: Smith, Elder and Co., London, 1827 The chapel and about two thirds of the bridge were in the parish of St Magnus. After some years of rivalry a dispute arose between the church and the chapel over the offerings given to the chapel by the pilgrims. The matter was resolved by the brethren of the chapel making an annual contribution to St Magnus.Colleges: St Thomas on London Bridge, A History of the County of London: Volume 1: London within the Bars, Westminster and Southwark, ed.

The patronage of St Magnus, having previously been in the Abbots and Convents of Westminster and Bermondsey (who presented alternatively), fell to the Crown on the suppression of the monasteries. In 1553, Queen Mary, by letters patent, granted it to the Bishop of London and his successors.Pat. 1, Mary, p. 4, m. 16.

Coverdale was buried in the chancel of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange, but when that church was pulled down in 1840 his remains were removed to St Magnus.A correct account of the exhumation of the remains of Myles Coverdale, some time Bishop of Exeter, and Rector of St Magnus the Martyr, London Bridge, Whittock, N.: London, 1840. There is now a large stone tablet affixed to the wall as a memorial. At the top is a depiction of an open Bible with the words \\"Romans Chap. XVI. Verse XVII. The Holy Bible\\" followed by the following text: \\"To the memory of Miles Coverdale who convinced that the pure Word of God ought to be the sole rule of our faith and guide of our practice laboured earnestly for its diffusion and with a view of affording the meaning of reading and hearing in their own tongue the wonderful works of God not only to his own countrymen but to the nations that sit in darkness and to every church wheresoever the English language might be spoken he spent many years of his life preparing a translation of the Scriptures. On the IV of October MDXXXV the first complete English printed version of the Bible was published under his direction. The parishioners of St Magnus Martyr, desirous of acknowledging the mercy of God and calling to mind that Miles Coverdale was once Rector of their parish, erected this monument to his memory A.D. MDCCCXXXVII. How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. Isaiah LII chap. VII\\" On a separate smaller tablet mounted on the wall are the following words: \\"Near this tablet in a vault made for that purpose are deposited the bones of Miles Coverdale, formerly Bishop of Exeter and Rector of the parish of St Magnus the Martyr in the year of our Lord 1564. His remains were interred in the first instance in the chancel of the Church of St Bartholomew, Exchange: but on the occasion of that church being taken down they were brought here on the fourth of October 1840 in compliance with the wishes and at the request of the Rector the Rev. Tho. Leigh A.M. and parishioners of St Magnus the Martyr.\\" On 5 November 1562 the churchwardens were ordered to break, or cause to be broken, in two parts all the altar stones in the church.Vic.-Gen. Book, Huish, f. 169, S.H. quoted in Novum repertorium ecclesiasticum parochiale Londinense, p. 273 Coverdale, an anti- vestiarian, was Rector at the peak of the vestments controversy. In March 1566 Archbishop Parker caused great consternation among many clergy by his edicts prescribing what was to be worn and by his summoning the London clergy to Lambeth to require their compliance. Coverdale excused himself from attending.Oxford DNB entry, Daniell, D. Stow records that a non-conforming Scot who normally preached at St Magnus twice a day precipitated a fight on Palm Sunday 1566 at Little All Hallows in Thames Street with his preaching against vestments.Historical Memoranda, Stow, J.: Camden Society, 1880. The text reads: \\"Ye same Palme Sonday in anno 1566, ye 7 of Aprill, a Scott (who prechid ij tymes every day at Sent Magnus, and mynysteryd every day to all comars of ye paryshe or eny othar in his gowne or cloke) prechid in ye afternone at Lytle Allhalows in Thams Stret.

Separatist congregations started to emerge after 1566 and the first such, who called themselves 'Puritans' or 'Unspottyd Lambs of the Lord', was discovered close to St Magnus at Plumbers' Hall in Thames Street on 19 June 1567.History of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, Young A.J., p. 86: privately printed by The Worshipful Company of Plumbers, London, 2000 Old London bridge in 1543 =17th century: Civil War, Commonwealth and Restoration= Old London Bridge in 1616. The spiked heads of executed criminals can be seen above the Southwark gatehouse. Heads of traitors, including Catholic priests, on Old London Bridge St Magnus narrowly escaped destruction in 1633. A later edition of Stow's Survey records that \\"On the 13th day of February, between eleven and twelve at night, there happened in the house of one Briggs, a Needle-maker near St Magnus Church, at the North end of the Bridge, by the carelessness of a Maid-Servant setting a tub of hot sea-coal ashes under a pair of stairs, a sad and lamentable fire, which consumed all the buildings before eight of the clock the next morning, from the North end of the Bridge to the first vacancy on both sides, containing forty-two houses; water then being very scarce, the Thames being almost frozen over.\\"Quoted in Chronicles of London Bridge by an Antiquary [i.e. Richard Thomson 1794‚Äì1865], pp. 394‚Äì5.: Smith, Elder and Co., London, 1827 Susannah Chambers \\"by her last will & testament bearing date 28th December 1640 gave the sum of Twenty-two shillings and Sixpence Yearly for a Sermon to be preached on the 12th day of February in every Year within the Church of Saint Magnus in commemoration of God's merciful preservation of the said Church of Saint Magnus from Ruin, by the late and terrible Fire on London Bridge.

Glass painters such as Baptista Sutton, who had previously installed \\"Laudian innovations\\", found new employment by repairing and replacing these to meet increasingly strict Protestant standards. In January 1642 Sutton replaced 93 feet of glass at St Magnus and in June 1644 he was called back to take down the \\"painted imagery glass\\" and replace it.Vidimus, no. 33: October 2009 In June 1641 \\"rail riots\\" broke out at a number of churches. This was a time of high tension following the trial and execution of the Earl of Strafford and rumours of army and popish plots were rife. The Protestation Oath, with its pledge to defend the true religion \\"against all Popery and popish innovation\\", triggered demands from parishioners for the removal of the rails as popish innovations which the Protestation had bound them to reform. The minister arranged a meeting between those for and against the pulling down of the rails, but was unsuccessful in reaching a compromise and it was feared that they would be demolished by force.Puritan iconoclasm during the English Civil War, Spraggon, J.: Woodbridge, 2003 However, in 1663 the parish resumed Laudian practice and re- erected rails around its communion table.According to Ancient Custom: The Return of Altars in the Restoration Church of England, Fincham, K., pp. 29‚Äì54: Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 2003 Joseph Caryl was incumbent from 1645 until his ejection in 1662.

St Magnus stood less than 300 yards from the bakehouse of Thomas Farriner in Pudding Lane where the fire started.

(Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within and, in 1708/09, Lord Mayor of London). Tradition says \\"that it was erected in consequence of a vow made by the donor, who, in the earlier part of his life, had once to wait a considerable time in a cart upon London Bridge, without being able to learn the hour, when he made a promise, that if he ever became successful in the world, he would give to that Church a public clock ... that all passengers might see the time of day.\\"Chronicles of London Bridge by an Antiquary [i.e. Richard Thomson 1794‚Äì1865], pp. 456‚Äì7.: Smith, Elder and Co., London, 1827 The maker was Langley Bradley, a clockmaker in Fenchurch Street, who had worked for Wren on many other projects, including the clock for the new St Paul's Cathedral. The sword rest in the church, designed to hold the Lord Mayor's sword and mace when he attended divine service \\"in state\\", dates from 1708. Duncombe and his benefactions to St Magnus feature prominently in Daniel Defoe's The True-Born Englishman, a biting satire on critics of William III that went through several editions from 1700 (the year in which Duncombe was elected Sheriff).See The True-Born Englishman and Poetry of Daniel Defoe. The poem introduces Duncombe in the following terms: And lest examples should be too remote, A modern magistrate of famous note, Shall give you his own history by rote. I'll make it out deny it he that can, His worship is a True-born Englishman, In all the latitude that empty word By modern acceptation's understood. The parish-books his great descent record, And now he hopes ere long to be a lord; And truly, as things go it would be a pity But such as he should represent the city; While robbery for burnt-offering he brings, And gives to God what he has stole from kings! Great monuments of charity he raises, And good St. Magnus whistles out his praises. To city gaols he grants a jubilee, And hires huzzas from his own mobilee. Lately he wore the golden chain and gown, With which equipp'd, he thus harangued the town; Organ in St Magnus the Martyr Shortly before his death in 1711, Duncombe commissioned an organ for the church, the first to have a swell-box, by Abraham Jordan (father and son).Great Goldsmith: The Life of Sir Charles Duncombe, Duncombe, P., p. 212-213: Chippendale NSW Australia, 2000, and \\"The Historical Organ in the Church of St Magnus the Martyr, London Bridge\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 53, No. 831 (1 May 1912), pp. 306‚Äì309.

The fire burnt warehouses to the south of the church and a number of houses on the northern end of London Bridge. Pathway under the tower of the church As part of the bridge improvements, overseen by the architect Sir Robert Taylor, a new pedestrian walkway was built along the eastern side of the bridge.

As a consequence it was necessary in 1762 to 1763 to remove the vestry rooms at the West end of the church and open up the side arches of the tower so that people could pass underneath the tower.This can be seen in a colour aquatint by William Daniell, III: The City from London Bridge ‚Äì Six Views of London, published 1 June 1804; see Daniell.

We had soldiers in the Vestry Room [at St Magnus the Martyr Church, next to where Richard was living] to guard the Toll House and Waterworks.\\" This demonstrated the importance of the area giving access to London Bridge, where the tolls were collected from pedestrians and carriages alike, and of the Waterworks on the other side of the road from St Magnus, which daily pumped water into elm conduits leading to private houses throughout the City. The rioting forced Richard to leave the area for his own safety.

In 1890 it was reported that the Bishop of London was to hold an inquiry as to the desirability of uniting the benefices of St George Botolph Lane and St Magnus. The expectation was a fusion of the two livings, the demolition of St George‚Äôs and the pensioning of \\"William Gladstone‚Äôs favourite Canon\\", Malcolm MacColl. Although services ceased there, St George‚Äôs was not demolished until 1904. The parish was then merged with St Mary at Hill rather than St Magnus.The Quebec Saturday Budget, 2 August 1890 The patronage of the living was acquired in the late 19th century by Sir Henry Peek, Senior Partner of Peek Brothers & Co of 20 Eastcheap, the country's largest firm of wholesale tea brokers and dealers, and Chairman of the Commercial Union Assurance Co.

He also erected a statue of Our Lady of Walsingham and arranged pilgrimages to the Norfolk shrine, where he was one of the founding guardians.Colin Stephenson relates that on one of the first pilgrimages organized by Fynes- Clinton the train kept stopping with a jolt and the guard insisted that someone was pulling the communication cord.

At one point the party were all thrown on their backs when standing to say the Salve Regina. In 1928 the journal of the Catholic League reported that St Magnus had presented a votive candle to the shrine at Walsingham \\"in token of our common Devotion and the mutual sympathy and prayers that are we hope a growing bond between the peaceful country shrine and the church in the heart of the hurrying City, from the Altar of which the Pilgrimages regularly start\\".See Catholic League Fynes-Clinton was General Secretary of the Anglican and Eastern Orthodox Churches Union and its successor, the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association, from 1906 to 1920 and served as Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury's Eastern Churches Committee from 1920 to around 1924.

During their stay they visited Egilsay and were shown the spot where St Magnus had been slain. Later Fynes-Clinton was present at a service held at the roofless church of St Magnus on Egilsay, where he suggested to his host Mr Fryer, the minister of the Cathedral, that the congregations of Kirkwall and London should unite to erect a permanent stone memorial on the traditional site where Earl Magnus had been murdered. In 1938 a cairn was built of local stone on Egilsay. It stands 12 feet high and is 6 feet broad at its base. The memorial was dedicated on 7 September 1938 and a bronze inscription on the monument reads \\"erected by the Rector and Congregation of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge and the Minister and Congregation of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall to commemorate the traditional spot where Earl Magnus was slain, AD circa 1116 and to commemorate the Octocentenary of St Magnus Cathedral 1937\\".See Orkney Communities and The Church of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge, Anon.

It appears that they had faded and the combination of strong, even lighting and longish exposure time, not to mention the quality of contemporary negatives/plates and printing technology, contributed to the loss of detail in the photographs. Above the reredos Travers added a painted and gilded rood.London 1: The City of London, Pevsner, N. and Bradley, S., p. 232: London, 1997 In the centre of the reredos there is a carved gilded pelican (an early Christian symbol of self-sacrifice) and a Baroque-style roundel with a nimbus and dove descending, attended by cherubim.Typical of \\"the late stuart chancel [which] expressed a complex, sacramentally high-church, socially royalist theology, rooted in the Anglican rites, Holy Scripture, and Anglican doctrine\\" The Moral Shecinah: The Social Theology of Chancel Decoration in Seventeenth Century London David H.

A new altar with console tables was installed and the communion rails moved outwards to extend the size of the sanctuary. Two old door frames were used to construct side chapels and placed at an angle across the north-east and south-east corners of the church. One, the Lady Chapel, was dedicated to the Rector's parents in 1925 and the other was dedicated to Christ the King. Originally, a baroque aumbry was used for reservation of the Blessed Sacrament, but later a tabernacle was installed on the Lady Chapel altar and the aumbry was used to house a relic of the True Cross. The interior was made to look more European by the removal of the old box pews and the installation of new pews with cut-down ends. Two new columns were inserted in the nave to make the lines regular. The Wren-period pulpit by the joiner William GreyThe Visitor's Guide to the City of London Churches, Tucker, T., p. 55: London, 2006 was opened up and provided with a soundboard and crucifix. Travers also designed the statue of St Magnus of Orkney, which stands in the south aisle, and the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham.Anglican Papalism, Yelton, M., p. 226: Norwich, 2005 On the north wall there is a Russian Orthodox icon, painted in 1908.

The site of the old Plumbers' Hall is now commemorated by a plaque and statue in Cannon Street Station Plumber‚Äôs Apprentice. A fireplace from the Hall was re-erected in the Vestry House. The other windows on the north side are by Alfred L. Wilkinson (1899-1983)The son of Horace Wilkinson, also an artist working in stained glass, Alfred Wilkinson trained at St Martin's School of Art in London before working with his father from 1920 until 1939 in London. He was subsequently based at several addresses in London, Hertfordshire and Essex, and also designed for G. King & Son of Norwich. Horace Wilkinson (1866-1957) was frequently employed by the architect W.D. Caroe, a Past Master of the Plumbers' Company. and date from 1952 to 1960. These show the arms of the Plumbers‚Äô, Fishmongers‚Äô and Coopers‚Äô Companies together with those of William Wand when Bishop of London and Geoffrey Fisher when Archbishop of Canterbury and (as noted above) the badge of the Fraternity of Our Lady de Salve Regina. The stained glass windows in the south wall, which are by Lawrence Lee and date from 1949 to 1955, represent lost churches associated with the parish: St Magnus and his ruined church of Egilsay, St Margaret of Antioch with her lost church in New Fish Street (where the Monument to the Great Fire now stands), St Michael with his lost church of Crooked Lane (demolished to make way for the present King William Street) and St Thomas Becket with his chapel on Old London Bridge.See St Magnus and Stained Glass The church possesses a fine model of Old London Bridge. One of the tiny figures on the bridge appears out of place in the mediaeval setting, wearing a policeman's uniform. This is a representation of the model-maker, David T. Aggett, who is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers and was formerly in the police service.Official Commemorative Programme: The Lord Mayor's Show 2008, p.49: London, 2008 The Mischiefs by Fire Act 1708 and the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 placed a requirement on every parish to keep equipment to fight fires.

However, the tenor became cracked in 1713 and it was decided to replace the bells with a new ring of eight.St Magnus Vestry Book Vol. 1 MS 1179/1 9 Dec 1713 The new bells, with a tenor of 21 cwt, were cast by Richard Phelps of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Between 1714 and 1718 (the exact date of which is unknown), the ring was increased to ten with the addition of two trebles given by two former ringing Societies, the Eastern Youths and the British Scholars.Peal book of the Society of College Youths ‚Äì representing the only known reference to this gift The first peal was rung on 15 February 1724 of Grandsire Caters by the Society of College Youths.

In 1843, the treble was said to be \\"worn out\\" and so was scrapped, together with the saints bell, while a new treble was cast by Thomas Mears.St Magnus Joint Committee Vol 3. MS 1183/3 28 July 1843 A new clock bell was erected in the spire in 1846, provided by B R & J Moore, who had earlier purchased it from Thomas Mears.St Magnus Vestry MS 1180 13 April 1846 This bell can still be seen in the tower from the street. The 10 bells were removed for safe keeping in 1940 and stored in the churchyard. They were taken to Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1951 whereupon it was discovered that four of them were cracked. After a long period of indecision, fuelled by lack of funds and interest, the bells were finally sold for scrap in 1976. The metal was used to cast many of the Bells of Congress that were then hung in the Old Post Office Tower in Washington, D.C. A fund was set up on 19 September 2005, led by Dickon Love, a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths, with a view to installing a new ring of 12 bells in the tower in a new frame. This was the first of three new rings of bells he has installed in the City of London (the others being at St Dunstan-in-the-West and St James Garlickhythe). The money was raised and the bells were cast during 2008/9 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The tenor weighed 26cwt 3qtr 9 lbs (1360 kg) and the new bells were designed to be in the same key as the former ring of ten.

Approximately ¬£200,000 was stolen. Five members of the Irish Republican Socialist Party, Osgur Breatnach, Nicky Kelly, Brian McNally, Mick Plunkett and John Fitzpatrick, were arrested in connection with the robbery. After the failure of the authorities to produce a \\"book of evidence\\" against them, the four were released but were immediately re-arrested. During interrogation in Garda S√≠och√°na custody, all except Plunkett signed alleged confessions, presenting with extensive bruising and injuries they claimed were inflicted by members of the Garda√≠. While awaiting trial, Fitzpatrick jumped bail and left the country. The trial of McNally, Kelly and Breatnach in the Special Criminal Court became the longest-running trial in Irish criminal history, at 65 days, before it collapsed due to the death of one of the three judges, Judge John O'Connor of the Circuit Court. Medical evidence of beatings was presented to the court, both during the initial trial and the second trial. The court rejected this evidence, finding that the beatings had been self-inflicted or inflicted by the co-accused. Anticipating a conviction, Kelly fled before the conclusion of the second trial. The three were found guilty, solely on the basis of their confessions, and sentenced to between nine and 12 years' prison (Kelly was sentenced in absentia). In May 1980 Breatnach and McNally were acquitted on appeal on the grounds that their statements had been taken under duress. The same month, the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the robbery. Kelly returned to Ireland from the USA in June 1980, expecting to be acquitted. Instead he was incarcerated in the maximum-security Portlaoise Prison and spent the next four years proclaiming his innocence, including a 38-day period on hunger strike. After a campaign by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and others (including a song, Wicklow Boy, by the popular folk singer Christy Moore), Kelly was eventually released on \\"humanitarian grounds\\" in 1984. He was given a presidential pardon in 1992 and received ¬£1,000,000 in compensation. Breatnach and McNally were also given compensation.

The daughter of Allan Glover, she began her career at the municipal level, serving as a councillor in the town of Selkirk. She married Garry James Gordon Charles in 1969. Charles first ran for provincial office in the election of 1986, finishing third in the Selkirk riding with 1023 votes.

In early 1988, Pawley's government was unexpectedly defeated when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted against his party's annual budget in an evenly divided legislature. Pawley stepped down as premier and did not run in the election which followed. With the riding open, Charles was able to defeat NDP candidate Terry Sargeant by just 184 votes. The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in this election, and Charles spent the next two years in the official opposition.

The series was loosely based upon the Mercer Girls project, Asa Mercer's efforts to bring civilization to old Seattle in the 1860s by importing marriageable women from the east coast cities of the United States, where the ravages of the American Civil War left those towns short of men. Backstory The producers said the show was inspired by the movie Seven Brides for Seven Brothers in an interview with LA Times TV critic Cecil Smith. As a television western, set shortly after the end of the Civil War, the series rarely featured any form of gunplay, and violence was generally limited to comical fistfights. This was in keeping with the restrictions on television violence at the time. Stories highlighted the importance of cooperation, inter-racial harmony, and peaceful resolution of conflict. Plots were usually a mix of drama and humor. Being one of the first shows targeted at young women, most of the humor was at the expense of the men, but not particularly bitingly so. The 1951 movie Westward the Women follows a similar theme. Plot summary Candy's brother and sister arrive in Seattle In the pilot episode, smooth- talking, charismatic logging company boss Jason Bolt (Robert Brown) is faced with a shutdown of his operation as lonely lumberjacks are ready to leave Seattle due to the lack of female companionship. He promises to find marriageable ladies willing to come to the frontier town (population 152) and stay for a full year. Sawmill owner Aaron Stempel (Mark Lenard) puts up much of the expense money as a wager that Bolt will not succeed in bringing 100 suitable women; the Bolt brothers bet their mountain, Bridal Veil Mountain, home to their logging company. The Bolts travel to New Bedford, Massachusetts, recruit the women, then charter a mule-ship to take them back to Seattle. Local saloon owner Lottie (Joan Blondell) takes the women under her wing and becomes a mother figure to them, while Bolt desperately works to keep the women from leaving at the next high tide. Eventually, the women decide to give Seattle and the loggers a chance. The ship's captain, Clancy (Henry Beckman), develops a relationship with Lottie and becomes a regular character in the series. Much of the dramatic and comedic tension in the first season revolved around Stempel's efforts to sabotage the deal and take over the Bolts' holdings. Stempel became more friendly in the second and final season, which focused more on the development of individual characters and the conflicts associated with newcomers and with people just passing through. One running theme is the importance of family, as the Bolt brothers show through the closeness of their relationships, that by sticking together, democratically taking family votes, they can overcome the surprising obstacles life presents. Bobby Sherman and David Soul were propelled to pop stardom as Jason's brothers, Jeremy and Joshua. Jeremy took a prominent role, not only as the boyfriend of Candy Pruitt (Bridget Hanley), the beautiful, unofficial leader of the brides, but also as a young man with a stammer. In one episode, he is temporarily able to manage his stammer following coaching by a traveler who has come to Seattle.

This move to the Friday night death slot combined with the low ABC affiliate support caused the ratings to quickly slide out of the top 40, and production ceased in the spring of 1970, although most of those ABC affiliates repeated episodes throughout the summer months, as was then a standard procedure with most series. The final primetime episode in the United States was broadcast on Friday September 18, 1970. Joan Blondell received Emmy Award nominations each season for her performance as Lottie Hatfield. She lost to Barbara Bain in 1969, and to Susan Hampshire in 1970. Music The theme song \\"Seattle\\" was written by Jack Keller and Ernie Sheldon. Both Perry Como and Bobby Sherman recorded slightly different variations of the song. Como scored a minor hit, with his version reaching No. 38 in the U.S. Sherman's version, although receiving some airplay, was never released as a single. There is no reference in either version regarding the TV series title, i.e.; \\"...look out everyone! Here Come the Brides!\\" Starting with the series debut in September 1968 the series opened with a rousing instrumental score featuring screen stills of \\"Jason\\", \\"Jeremy & Joshua\\", \\"Candy & Aaron\\" and \\"Lottie\\". Starting with episode 8 (\\"A Jew Named Sullivan\\") as evidenced by the end credits, and to coincide with the spring 1969 release of the Perry Como 'pop' recording, the TV theme was reworked by overdubbing vocals/lyrics to the same theme music already recorded (as used previously) along with updating all the opening character stills, including the addition of a \\"Clancy & Biddie\\" screen. The added lyrics performed by \\"The New Establishment\\" and updated screen stills were featured for the remainder of the first season and remained unchanged for the entire second season. In the beginning syndication years, the instrumental version of the opening credits was placed on all episodes. In recent years, the vocal theme of the opening credits has been restored to the second-season episodes (although with the first season screen stills). French version A French-language version of the show and theme song (performed by a chorus of male singers) was a smash hit in French Canada, under the title Cent filles √† marier (A Hundred Girls to Marry Off). The show capitalized on the popularity of the American version and the fact that a similar \\"bride drive\\" (see Filles du roi) is also part of Qu√©bec's cultural mythos.

However, the season 1 opening cast-and-credit sequence was used for this release, using the New Establishment's vocals, but ignoring Henry Beckman's and Susan Tolsky's respective credits.Here Come the Brides - 'The Complete 2nd Season:' Shout!'s Street Date, Cost, Packaging TVShowsonDVD.com, 2001-11-07. In December 2009, BearManor Media released a nostalgic look into the program's history, Gangway, Lord: (The) Here Come The Brides Book by Jonathan Etter, which featured a foreword by Robert Brown. Bobby Sherman was the only (then) surviving cast member who did not cooperate with the author. However, Sherman did discuss the series in his autobiography, Bobby Sherman: Still Remembering You, whose contents he dictated to Dena Hill, and was subsequently published by Contemporary Books in 1996. Syndication Reruns were aired on CBN Cable during the mid-1980s. Early in January 2011, digital sub-network Antenna TV began airing the series. INSP began broadcasting a back to back 2 episode block of the series on Sunday mornings in 2018 continuing through 2020. The Decades channel aired most of the series during a weekend marathon on June 2‚Äì3, 2018 and again February 1‚Äì2, 2019 in widescreen format. The episodes were cropped for the widescreen presentation.  Star Trek crossovers  Barbara Hambly's Star Trek novel Ishmael has Spock traveling back to the time and place of Here Come the Brides after discovering a Klingon plot to destroy the Federation by killing Aaron Stempel (spelled \\"Stemple\\" in the book) before he could thwart an attempted 19th-century alien invasion of Earth. During most of the story, Spock has lost his memory and is cared for by Stempel, who passes him off as his nephew \\"Ishmael\\" and helps him hide his alien origins. At the end of the story, Captain Kirk discovers that Stempel is one of Spock's mother's ancestors, a reference to the fact that Mark Lenard also played Spock's father Sarek in episodes of the original Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation, as well as several of the Star Trek motion pictures. Majel Barrett, who played Nurse Christine Chapel in Star Trek, appeared as Tessa a dancehall woman in the first-season episode \\"Lovers and Wanderers\\". Jane Wyatt who played Spock's mother in the original series, made a guest appearance in the final episode of the series, \\"Two Women\\". She did not have any scenes with Mark Lenard. In addition to Lenard, other Brides actors appeared in Star Trek: Robert Brown (both of the Lazaruses in \\"The Alternative Factor\\"), David Soul (Makora in \\"The Apple\\"), and semi-regular Carole Shelyne (the visible representation of a Metron in \\"Arena\\", whose voice Vic Perrin provided in that installment).

It was built by Jones Quiggen, a ship builder in Liverpool, England and launched on June 21, 1864. Owl, sister to CSS Bat, was more fortunate than her twin which followed her closely. Owl succeeded in running into Wilmington, North Carolina sometime in September 1864, although United States Consul Mortimer Melville Jackson telegraphed Washington, D.C. that Owl had \\"a large, valuable cargo\\" cleared August 31--officially for Nassau, Bahamas. She escaped to sea from Wilmington on October 3; her masts were visible all the while she lay in port loading. The blockaders wounded her captain and several crewmen, but 9 shots failed to stop Owl. She was now commanded by Commander John Newland Maffitt, CSN--the \\"Prince of Privateers\\"-- detached from CSS Albemarle at Plymouth, North Carolina on or about September 9. Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory, telegraphing on September 19, warned Maffitt: \\"It is of the first importance that our steamers should not fall into the enemy's hands‚Ä¶ these vessels, lightly armed, now constitute the fleetest and most efficient part of his blockading force off Wilmington.\\" Maffitt was to take no passengers, as a rule, and Assistant Paymaster Adam Tredwell, CSN, would deliver \\"5,000 pounds in sterling bills before sailing,\\" Mallory concluded. Owl was at Bermuda with cotton October 24-29, as the U.S. Consul faithfully reported. On December 5, Mallory instructed Maffitt to pick up CSS Floridas men in Bermuda. A letter to Mallory captured, along with Assistant Paymaster Talley, CSN, by USS Forest Rose on May 7, 1865 bears an endorsement by her commander, Lieutenant A. N. Gould, USN: \\"It shows that Maffitt has been landing on the Florida coast with the Owl.\\" U.S. Consul William Thomas Minor at Havana, Cuba reported on May 20 that Maffitt was to leave there in a day or two for Galveston, Texas. On this last trip Owl was almost captured at Wilmington by a Federal cruiser and had to jettison valuable mail as well as sustain 12 casualties. Maffitt then tried Galveston, and grounded on Bird Island Shoals at the entrance within range of 16 enemy cruisers. Captain James H. MacGarvey, CSN, in little CSS Diana got Owl off barely in time; she not only ran into port but ran out safely too. There is some evidence Owls last two runs through the blockade were made under the name of Foam. Owl was delivered to Fraser, Trenholm & Co. in Liverpool after war's end, and Maffitt took the Board of Trade examinations to command British merchant ships to South America.

Seal of the San Carlos Apache tribe The Western Apache live primarily in east central Arizona, in the United States. Most live within reservations. The Fort Apache Indian Reservation, San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, Yavapai-Apache Nation, Tonto Apache, and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation are home to the majority of Western Apache and are the bases of their federally recognized tribes. In addition, there are numerous bands. The Western Apache bands call themselves Ndee (Ind√©) (‚ÄúThe People‚Äù); because of dialectical differences the Pinale√±o/Pinal and Arivaipa/Aravaipa bands of the San Carlos Apache pronounce the word Innee or Nnƒìƒì:.Shadows at Dawn - The Peoples - Nnƒìƒì / Apache / 'O:b Language and culture San Carlos Apache woman, c. 1883-1887, photographed by Randall, A. Frank The various dialects of Western Apache (called by them Ndee biyati' / Nnee biyati') are a form of Apachean, a branch of the Southern Athabaskan language family. The Navajo speak a related Apachean language, but the peoples separated several hundred years ago and are considered culturally distinct. Other indigenous peoples who speak Athabaskan are located in Alaska and Canada. The anthropologist Grenville Goodwin classified the Western Apache into five groups based on Apachean dialect and culture: * Cibecue, * Northern Tonto, * Southern Tonto, * San Carlos, and * White Mountain. Since Goodwin, other researchers have disputed his conclusion of five linguistic groups, but have agreed on three main Apachean dialects with several subgroupings: * San Carlos, * White Mountain, and * Dilzhe'e (Tonto). Some 20,000 Western Apache still speak their native language, and efforts have been made to preserve it. Bilingual teachers are often employed in the lower elementary grades to expedite that goal, but the tendency toward children learning to speak only English, mingled with occasional Spanish, remains dominant. In relation to culture, tribal schools offer classes in native handicrafts, such as basket weaving, making bows, arrows, spears, shields; cradles for infants, native regalia from buckskin for the young women, and the making of silver jewelry (often by the men) at the elementary and secondary level. Western Apache bands and tribes =White Mountain Apache= The White Mountain Apache or Dzi≈Ç ≈Åigai Si'√°n N'dee \\"People of the White Mountains\\" (), are currently centered in Fort Apache Indian Reservation. It is the most eastern band of the Western Apache group. The White Mountain Apaches are a federally recognized tribe.

Claimed the area around the community Sunflower Valley, the Mazatzal Mountains south of its highest peak, Mazatzal Peak (2.409 m), and to the east in the area around the former Fort Camp Reno in the western Tonto Basin (also called Pleasant Valley). *** Ts√© No≈Çt≈Ç ºizhn' (Apache name) or Hichapulvapa clan (‚Äöbunch-of-wood-sticking-up People‚Äò, Yavapai name); in English simply known as \\"Mazatzal band\\" (Apache). They claimed the Mazatzal Mountains southward from East Verde River and westward from North Peak to Mazatzal Peak. ** Dil Zhƒô º√© semi-band (a bilingual mixed Apache-Yavapai group with two names: in Apache: DilzhƒôÃÅ‚Äô√©, Dil Zhe\`√© - ‚ÄòPeople with high-pitched voices‚Äô and in Yavapai: Matkawatapa clan (‚Äöred-strata-country People, i.e. Sierra Ancha People‚Äò). The Dil Zhƒô º√© semi-band are the first and most important semi-band under which name the five remaining semi-bands were known, those Dil Zhƒô º√© of Sierra Ancha formed with members of the Walkamepa band a bilingual unit). *** second semi-band (lived along Tonto Creek and Rye Creek in the Gisela area, south of the third/Payson semi-band and northeast of the Mazatzal band) *** third semi-band (perhaps one of the principal Dilzhe'e Apache clans - the \\"People of the Yellow Speckled Water\\", their territory encompassed the Tonto Apache Reservation, they were living in the Round Valley-Payson area known in Apache as Te-go-suk (\\"Place of the Yellow Water\\" or \\"Place of the Yellow Land\\")). *** fourth semi-band (lived near the confluence of the East Verde with the Verde River, most south of the East Verde between the territories of the Guwevkabaya-Yavapai southwest and Mazatzal band south, the second/Gisela semi-band to the east, and the third/Payson semi-band to the northeast, and the fifth/Pine semi-band north) *** fifth semi-band (lived along the East Verde River north and along Pine Creek in Strawberry and Pine valleys, a tributary of Tonto Creek, in the Pine area)The Rye Creek Projekt Archeology in the Upper Tonto Basin *** sixth semi- band =Other bands and groups= Often groups of Wi:pukba (Wipukepa) and Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya) of the Yavapai lived together with the Tonto Apache (as well as bands of the San Carlos Apache) in bilingual rancherias, and could not be distinguished by outsiders (Spaniards, Americans, or Mexicans) except on the basis of their first language. The Yavapai and Apache together were often referred to as Tonto or Tonto Apaches. Therefore, it is not always easy to find out whether it is now exclusively dealing with Yavapai or Apache, or those mixed bands. The Wi:pukba (Wipukepa) and Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya) were therefore, because of their ancestral and cultural proximity to the Tonto and San Carlos Apaches, often incorrectly called Yavapai Apaches or Yuma Apaches. The ∆âo:lkabaya (Tolkepaya), the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (also belonging to the Upland Yuma Peoples) were also referred as Yuma Apaches or Mohave Apaches.Timothy Braatz: Surviving Conquest: A History of the Yavapai Peoples, 2003, University of Nebraska Press, Notable Western Apache =White Mountain Apaches= * Alchesay (aka William Alchesay and Alchisay - \\"The Little One\\", May 17, 1853 ‚Äì Aug.6, 1928) was a chief of the White Mountain Apache and an Apache Scout. He received United States militaries highest decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Apache Wars and the Yavapai Wars. He tried to convince Geronimo to surrender peacefully. Became later a prominent stockman, made several trips to Washington D.C., and was active in Indian affairs. * Bylas (aka Bailish or Baylas - \\"One Who Does All the Talking\\") chief of the Eastern White Mountain band, for whom the present settlement of Bylas on the San Carlos Reservation is named, this Apache settlement is divided into two communities, one of the White Mountain, the other of San Carlos and Southern Tonto Apache. * Francisco *Indian name (Gochaaha = Big One) killed 11/10 - 1865, chief of the Eastern White Mountain Coyotero Apache band, maybe he had been in his childhood a Mexican captive and thus inherited his Spanish name or he is to be identified with Na-ginit-a (\\"He Scouts Ahead\\"), an Eastern White Mountain chief closely enaged with Chiricahua chief Cochise - both Francisco and Na-ginit-a being killed by venom in 1865 at Camp Goodwin -, arrested because of his involvement in the Cienega massacre and \\"executed\\" in unclear circumstances. * Esh-kel- dah-sila (Eskiltesela, Esketeshelaw, Hask…õdasila - ‚ÄúHe Is Constantly Angry‚Äù, Heske-hldasila - ‚ÄúAngry, Right Side Up‚Äù, also known as Clear-Eyed Eskeltesela, fl. c. 1850-1875) chief of the Nadostusn clan (Nddohots'osn, Ndhodits or Naagodolts'oosri - ‚Äúslender peak standing up people‚Äù) as of the entire Eastern White Mountain Apache band, most respected and prominent Eastern White Mountain Apache chief in history, he maintained alliances with Hopi and Zuni, offered land for the establishment of Camp Apache (later Fort Apache), Pedro and his Carrizo band of Cibecue Apaches got permission from him to settle near later Fort Apache on White Mountain Apache territory, he and his band were generally ill-disposed toward Cibecue Apache bands of Miguel, Diablo and Pedro, who had enlisted as Apache Scouts in 1871 and were scouting against ‚Äútroublemakers‚Äù of Esh-kel-dah-sila's band. * Polone, succeeded in 1873 Esh- kel-dah-sila as chief of the Eastern White Mountain Apache band. =Cibecue Apache= * Miguel (also known as One-Eyed-Miguel or El Tuerto, Esh-ke-iba, Es-ch√°¬¥-pa, Es-ca-pa or Hashkeeba - \\"Aware of His Anger\\", sometimes called Pin-dah-kiss, ca. ? - ‚Ä†1871) chief of the dominant local group and clan of the Carrizo band, during the 1850s and 1860s most prominent Carrizo chief, in 1869 Miguel and his younger brother Diablo initiated relations between Americans and the Cibecue and White Mountain Apaches, which led to the establishment of Fort Apache (first as Camp Apache in 1870). He supplied recruits for the first unit of Apache Scouts in 1871, because the Cibecue Apaches were forced to settle near Camp Apache on White Mountain Apache territory in spring 1874, he was killed shortly after during a feud with White Mountain Apaches, after that, Diablo took over leadership from his deceased older brother and avenged his death. * Diablo (El Diablo - \\"the Devil\\" or Capitan Grande, Hashkeedasillaa - \\"His Anger is Lying Side By Side\\", also Es-ki-in-la, Eskiniaw, Esh-ken-la or Eskeltesala, c. 1846 - ‚Ä†30. Aug.1880) after the death of his older brother Chief Miguel in 1874 during a feud with the White Mountain Apaches, he became the most prominent chief of the Carrizo band, in the fall of 1874 he enlisted as Scout and was promoted to sergeant, in January 1876 he and his band together with other Cibecue Apache bands were forced to move onto the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, only Pedro's band was allowed to stay at Fort Apache - which led to ill feelings towards the latter, therefore Diablo's band attacked on August 30, 1880 Pedro's band near Fort Apache, which resulted in the killing of Diablo himself, not to be confused with Esh-kel-dah-sila, the most prominent Eastern White Mountain Apache chief at this time. * Pedro (Hashkee-y√†n√¨lt≈Ç'i-dn, Hacke-yanil-tli-din - \\"Angry, He Ask for It\\", also known as Pedro, the Imitator, ca. 1835 - ‚Ä†1885) chief of the Tca-tci-dn clan (also Cacidn, Tea-tci-dn or Tsee hachiidn - ‚Äúred rock strata people‚Äù) and local group of the Carrizo band,the Tca-tci-dn (‚Äúred rock strata people‚Äù) of Pedro were limited almost exclusively to the Carrizo band of the Cibecue Apaches, and were the only people on the Fort Apache Reservation who were not forced to go to San Carlos in 1875 during a clan dispute in the early 1850s he was driven off the Carrizo Creek by Miguel, was allowed by the great Eastern White Mountain Apache chief Esh-kel-dah-sila after two years to settle near Fort Apache, Pedro's band intermarried with the White Mountain Apaches and were therefore classed as White Mountain Apaches, however they retained close clan ties with the Carrizo band of the Cibecue Apaches, he and his segundo (or war chief) Yclenny together with White Mountain Apache chiefs Alchesay and Petone killed August 30, 1880 Diablo, (oft mistaken for Esh-kel- dah-sila, the most prominent Eastern White Mountain Apache chief at this time) in selfdefense, in revenge for the death of Diablo he was shot through both knees but survived, only Petone was mortally wounded, was a constant friend of the Americans. * Petone succeeded his father Pedro about 1873 as chief of the Carrizo band of Cibecue Apaches - now generally classed as White Mountain Apaches. He was involved in the murder of the influential Carrizo band chief Diablo on August 30, 1880, half a year later in February 1881 members of Diablo's band would avenge his death. In this battle, Pedro was shot through both knees and Alchesay through the chest, both of them survived, but Petone was mortally wounded. * Capit√°n Chiquito (also known as Captain Chiquito, Chief of the Cibecue band, not to be confused with the Pinale√±o Apache Chief of the same name) * Nock-ay-det-klinne (Nakaidoklini, Nakydoklunni - \\"spotted or freckled Mexican\\", called by the Whites Babbyduclone, Barbudeclenny, Bobby- dok-linny and Freckled Mexican Matthews) chief of the Ca√±on Creek band and a respected medicine man among his people, held dances and claimed to bring two dead chiefs, the Carrizo band chief Diablo and the Cibecue band chief Es-ki- ol-e to life, fearing an Apache uprising the Army tried to arrest the medicine man which led to the Battle of Cibecue Creek on Aug.30, 1881, after the fighting erupted the Apache scouts mutinied as suspected. The attacking Apaches fought mainly at rifle range, however, when the scouts turned against the soldiers, a brief close range engagement occurred. As the battle ended with a strategic Apache victory, despite their inability to rescue their leader, due to the soldiers retreat. After the battle, the American army buried six soldiers, Nock-ay-det-klinne, his wife, and young son, who was killed while riding into battle on his father's pony. The Cibecue affair touched off a regional Apache uprising, in which the leading men of the Chiricahua bands, such as Naiche (c. 1857-1919), Juh (c. 1825 ‚Äì Nov. 1883), and Geronimo (June 16, 1829 ‚Äì Feb.17, 1909), left the reservation and went to war in Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. The warfare lasted about two years, ultimately ending in the US defeat of the Apache. * Ne-big-ja-gy (also called Ka-clenny and Es-keg-i-slaw) was brother of Nock-ay-det-klinne, the medicine men and chief of the Ca√±on Creek band. He succeeded his brother as chief of the Ca√±on Creek band. * S√°nchez (B√©-cbi…£o'dn - ‚ÄúMetal Tooth‚Äù or ‚ÄúIron Tooth‚Äù) was successor of Diablo as Chief of the Carrizo Creek band. This band of about 250 people lived on Carrizo Creek, twelve miles north of Carrizo Crossing, was closely associated with Nock-ay-det-klinne. =San Carlos Apaches= * Casador (Casadora, N√†nt'√†ntco' - \\"Great Chief\\") was recognized as the main chief of the San Carlos band, before he left the reservation. * Eskinospas (Eskenaspas, H√†ck√≠n√°-sb√°s - ‚ÄúAngry Circular‚Äù, called by the Whites Nosy) chief of a local group of the Arivaipa band. * Santo, an Arivaipa Apache Chief and di-yin, father-in-law of Eskiminzin. * Eskiminzin (aka Hashkebansiziin, H√†ck√≠b√°√≠nz√≠n - \\"Angry, Men Stand in Line for Him\\", born approximately 1828 near the Pinal Mountains as a Pinale√±o) through marriage into the Arivaipa, became one of them and later their chief. He and his band together with the Pinale√±o band under Capit√°n Chiquito were attacked by on April 30, 1871 in the Camp Grant Massacre. Led by William S. Oury and Jes√∫s Mar√≠a El√≠as, who blamed every depredation in southern Arizona on the 500 Camp Grant Apaches, contacted an old ally Francisco Galerita, leader of the Tohono O'odham at San Xavier to punish the Arivaipa. In a surprise attack, 98 Apaches were killed and mutilated by Tohono O'odham (all but eight were women and children) and 27 children were sold into slavery in Mexico by the Tohono O'odham and the Mexicans. * Capit√°n Chiquito was chief of the Pinale√±o band, became together with the Arivaipa Chief Eskiminzin victim of the Camp Grant Massacre by Mexicans and their Tohono O'odham-allies, after the massacre the surviving Arivaipa and Pinale√±o bands fled north to their Tonto Apache and Yavapai allies, together they raiding and fought the Americans until into 1875 with its culmination in General George Crook's Tonto Basin Campaign of 1872 and 1873. * Talkalai (Talkali, *1817 - ‚Ä†Mar. 4, 1930, Miami) was chief of the Apache Peaks band, served as Chief of Scouts for three different United States Army Generals, Crook, Miles, and Howard. In April 1887 he was the leader of the scouts that marched 400 miles into Mexico and captured Geronimo. He once saved the life of his good friend John Clum, first Indian Agent at San Carlos Indian reservation, by shooting his own brother. This act so inflamed some of his band members, that he was forced to flee the reservation and move into the town of Miami, Arizona. He was also a friend of the Earps in Tombstone and had been a guest of President Cleveland in the White House. * Michael Minjarez, actor & Apache dialect supervisor =Tonto Apaches=  See also  * Western Apache language  References  Further reading * Basso, Keith H.

The first series premiered on 27 July 2003 on Network Ten. A large majority of viewers initially disliked him for his insensitive, cold attitude (including controversial comments on a female contestant's weight), but towards the end of his tenure he became hugely popular for his candid assessments of performances based on his expertise and experience within the record industry. He was also Australia's judge at the first World Idol in December 2003. =2005 ‚Äì 2006: Seven Network= Near the end of the 2004 series of Australian Idol, it was announced that Dickson would be leaving the show and Network Ten to move to the Seven Network to broaden his interests as a presenter and producer. The move caused controversy at the time, as the popularity of Idol and Dickson himself were at their peak. His first role at the Seven Network in 2005 was as host of the second season of reality TV series My Restaurant Rules, succeeding Curtis Stone. Also that year he was a contestant in Dancing with the Stars, placing third. During this time, Dickson and his business partner and manager, David Wilson, formed Watercooler Media, an independent television production company.

Chrissie left the show in 2009 and Dickson and O'Neil continued the show for one more year until its end in 2010. =2010 ‚Äì 2011: Can of Worms= On 4 July 2011 Can of Worms premiered on Network Ten with Dickson and Meshel Laurie as hosts. He and his business partner and manager, David Wilson, developed the show, in which celebrities were required to answer yes or no before a live studio audience to tricky moral questions such as, \\"Is it wrong to tell your kids there is no God?\\" and \\"If a woman has had a boob job, is it an open invitation to have a good look?\\". He and Wilson had pitched the show several times to various TV networks from 2005 to 2009, finally selling the concept to Network Ten with a pitch meeting where Dickson acted as host and the executives the contestants.

Personal life Dickson is married to Melanie Bell; they have two daughters and live on the Sunshine Coast. He became an Australian citizen on Australia Day, 26 January 2007. He is good friends with his Pop Idol and American Idol counterpart Simon Cowell, going back to their days working together in the British music industry. It was Cowell who convinced Dickson to take the role as the \\"villain judge\\", despite his reservations given that he was relatively new to his adopted homeland and wanted to settle at a gradual pace. Cowell guaranteed immediate money and fame as incentives. Dickson is a Foundation Member and ambassador of the Western Sydney Wanderers Football Club and was one of 14 Australian supporters who traveled to Saudi Arabia to watch the club win the AFC Champions League title in 2014. On an episode of the ABC Australian news program Four Corners broadcast on 19 February 2007, Dickson discussed his problems with alcohol. Dickson is an atheist: \\"I have developed a spirituality which I suppose you could call metaphysics or science of mind - nothing to do with Scientology, I hasten to add. It's something that was developed by a guy called Ernest Holmes, and it's about the law of the universe, the law of attraction. It's all that stuff that's been popular on The Secret but there's far more to it than that. I'm an atheist but I've got a spirituality I can fall back on. I don't like religion because I see it as a bureaucracy of faith and I've never really been big on bureaucracy.\\"Ian Dickson interviewed by Bridget McManus, 'Back to where he once belonged', The Age (Australia), August 2, 2007 (accessed May 22, 2008).

At Duke, he studied art (with Clare Leighton), graduating with a B.A. summa cum laude in classics and English literature. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year. Davenport was a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford from 1948 to 1950. He studied Old English under J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with a B.Litt., with a thesis on James Joyce. In 1950, upon his return to the United States, Davenport was drafted into the US Army for two years, spending them at Fort Bragg in the 756th Field Artillery, then in the XVIII Airborne Corps. After the army, he taught at Washington University in St. Louis until 1955, when he began earning a Ph.D. at Harvard, studying under Harry Levin and Archibald MacLeish. Davenport befriended Ezra Pound during the poet's incarceration in St. Elizabeths Hospital, visiting him annually from 1952 until Pound's release, in 1958, and later at Pound's home in Rapallo, Italy. Davenport described one such visit, in 1963, in the story \\"Ithaka\\". Davenport wrote his dissertation on Pound's poetry, published as Cities on Hills in 1983. This interest led him to Hugh Kenner, who became one of his most important literary friends. They carried on a voluminous correspondence from 1958 till 2002, as recorded in the book Questioning Minds: The Letters of Guy Davenport and Hugh Kenner. After completing his Ph.D., he taught at Haverford College from 1961 to 1963 but soon took a position at the University of Kentucky, \\"the remotest offer with the most pay,\\" as he wrote to Jonathan Williams. Davenport taught at Kentucky until he received a MacArthur Fellowship, which prompted his retirement, at the end of 1990.

His fiction uses three general modes of exposition: the fictionalizing of historical events and figures; the foregrounding of formal narrative experiments, especially with the use of collage; and the depicting of a Fourierist utopia, where small groups of men, women, and children have eliminated the separation between mind and body. The first of more than four hundred Davenport essays, articles, introductions, and book reviews appeared while he was still an undergraduate; the last, just weeks before his death. Davenport was a regular reviewer for National Review and The Hudson Review, and, late in his life, at the invitation of John Jeremiah Sullivan, he spent a year writing the \\"New Books\\" column for Harper's Magazine. His essays range from literary to social topics, from brief book reviews to lectures such as the title piece in his first collection of essays, The Geography of the Imagination. His other collections of essays were Every Force Evolves a Form and The Hunter Gracchus and Other Papers on Literature and Art. He also published two slim volumes on art: A Balthus Notebook and Objects on a Table. Although he wrote on many topics, Davenport, who never had a driver's license, was especially passionate about the destruction of American cities by the automobile. Davenport published a handful of poems. The longest are the book-length Flowers and Leaves, an intricate meditation on art and America, and \\"The Resurrection in Cookham Churchyard\\" (borrowing the title from a painting by Stanley Spencer). A selection of his poems and translations was published as Thasos and Ohio. Davenport translated ancient Greek texts, particularly from the archaic period. These were published in periodicals, then small volumes, and finally collected in 7 Greeks. He also translated the occasional other piece, including a few poems of Rilke's, some ancient Egyptian texts [after Boris de Rachewiltz], and, with Benjamin Urrutia, the sayings of Jesus, published as The Logia of Yeshua. Visual art With his childhood newspaper, Davenport launched both his literary and artistic vocations. The former remained dormant or sporadic for some time while the latter, \\"making drawings, watercolors, and gouaches, [continued] throughout school, the army, and his early years as a teacher.\\"Davenport, Guy. A Balance of Quinces. New York: New Directions, 1996. 26. He drew or painted nearly every day of his life, and his notebooks contain drawings and pasted-in illustrations and photos cheek by jowl with his own observations and other writings and quotations from others. From college forward, Davenport supplied cover art and decorations to literary periodicals. He also supplied illustrations for others' books, notably two by Hugh Kenner: The Stoic Comedians (1962) and The Counterfeiters (1968).Heer, Jeet. The Comics Journal #278, October 2006. \\"Guy Davenport, Cartoonist\\" The cover of Apples and Pears by Guy Davenport As a visual artist (and childhood newspaper magnate) who also wrote, Davenport had a lifelong interest in printing and book design. His poems and fictions were often first published in limited editions by small press craftsmen.Crane, Joan. Guy Davenport: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1947‚Äì1995. Haverford: Green Shade, 1996. 95,96. (See also 24 unnumbered pages of drawings inserted between pages 184 and 185). In 1965 Davenport and Laurence Scott prepared and printed Pound's Canto CX in an edition of 118 copies, 80 of which they presented to Pound for his 80th birthday. The previous year they had produced Ezra's Bowmen of Shu on the same press, a double broadside that published for the first time, with a brief introductory essay by Davenport, a drawing by sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and a letter of Gaudier's from the trenches of World War I that cites Pound's poem (translated from one in the Shi Jing) \\"The Song of the Bowmen of Shu\\".Song of the Bowmen of Shu ‚Äì A poem by Ezra Pound ‚Äì American Poems Many of Davenport's earlier stories are combinations of pictures and text, especially Tatlin! and Apples and Pears (where some of the illustrations are of pages that resemble those of his own notebooks). \\"It was my intention, when I began writing fiction several years ago, to construct texts that were both written and drawn.... I continued this method right through Apples and Pears... The designer [of A+P] understood [my] collages to be gratuitous illustrations having nothing to do with anything, reduced them all to burnt toast, framed them with nonsensical lines, and sabotaged my whole enterprise. I took this as final defeat, and haven't tried to combine drawing and writing in any later work of fiction.\\"50 Drawings (Dim Gray Bar Press, 1996. Introduction.)

He was canonized on 20 June 1670 by Pope Clement X. Early life He was born in Duchy of Gand√≠a, Valencia, on 28 October 1510. His father was Juan Borgia, 3rd Duke of Gand√≠a, the son of Giovanni Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia). His mother was Juana, daughter of Alonso de Arag√≥n, Archbishop of Zaragoza, who, in turn, was the illegitimate son of King Ferdinand II of Aragon. His brother, Tom√°s de Borja y Castro, also became a clergyman, becoming the Bishop of M√°laga, and later the Archbishop of Zaragoza. Although as a child he was very pious and wished to become a monk, his family sent him instead to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (who was also King Charles I of Spain), where he was welcomed as a kinsman. He distinguished himself there, accompanying the Emperor on several campaigns. Adult life and career In September 1529, he married a Portuguese noblewoman in Madrid, Leonor de Castro Mello y Meneses. They had eight children: Carlos in 1530, Isabel in 1532, Juan in 1533, √Ålvaro circa 1535, Juana also circa 1535, Fernando in 1537, Dorotea in 1538, and Alfonso in 1539. Charles V appointed him Marquess of Lombay, master of the hounds, and equerry to the empress. In 1539, he convoyed the corpse of Isabella of Portugal, Philip II of Spain's mother, to her burial place in Granada. In that same year (1539), he became Viceroy of Catalonia, replacing Fadrique de Portugal y Noro√±a, though he was only 29. He delighted above all in producing ecclesiastical compositions, and these display a remarkable contrapuntal style and bear witness to the skill of the composer, justifying indeed the assertion that, in the sixteenth century and prior to Palestrina, Borgia was one of the chief restorers of sacred music. In 1543 upon the death of his father, the 3rd Duke, Francis became the 4th Duke of Gand√≠a. His diplomatic abilities came into question when his attempt to arrange a marriage between Prince Philip and the Princess of Portugal failed, thus ending an attempt to bring these two countries together and resulting in his retirement. By then 33 years old, he had retired to his native place and devoted himself to religious activities. Jesuit priest Francis Borgia at Isabella of Portugal's coffin by Pietro della Vecchia In 1546 his wife Eleanor died, and Francis then decided to enter the newly formed Society of Jesus, after making adequate provisions for his children. He put his affairs in order circa 1551, renounced his titles in favour of his eldest son Carlos de Borja-Aragon y de Castro-Melo, and became a Jesuit priest. He helped in the establishment of what is now the Gregorian University in Rome.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.) Franciscan Media Upon Francis‚Äô return from a journey to Peru, Pope Julius III made known his intention to make him a cardinal. To prevent this, Borgia decided, in agreement with St. Ignatius, to leave the city secretly and go to the Basque Country, where it was thought he would be safe from the papal desires. He felt drawn to spend time in seclusion and prayer, but his administrative talents also made him a natural for other tasks. In time his friends persuaded him to accept the leadership role that nature and circumstances had destined him for: in 1554, he became the Jesuit commissary-general in Spain,\\"Our Parish Patron Saint - St. Francis Borgia\\", St. Francis Borgia Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois where he founded a dozen colleges. After only two years, St. Francis was also given responsibility for missions in the East and West Indies. In 1565, he was elected the third \\"Father General\\" or Superior General of the Society of Jesus, after the death in January 1565 of Diego Laynez, (Almaz√°n, Spain, 1512 ‚Äì January 1565). His successes during the period 1565‚Äì1572 have caused historians to describe Francis as the greatest General after Saint Ignatius. He founded the Collegium Romanum, which was to become the Gregorian University, advised kings and popes, and closely supervised all the affairs of the rapidly expanding order. Yet, despite the great power of his office, Francis led a humble life and was widely regarded in his own lifetime as a saint. Francis Borgia died in 1572. Veneration Francis Borgia died on 30 September 1572, in Rome. He was beatified in Madrid on 23 November 1624, by Pope Urban VIII. He was canonized nearly 35 years later on 20 June 1670, by Pope Clement X. His liturgical feast was inserted into the General Roman Calendar in 1688 for celebration on 10 October, the date then free from other celebrations that was closest to that of his death. Legacy Borgia and the impenitent dying man by Francisco Goya Parishes are dedicated to St. Francis Borgia in Chicago, Illinois, Sturgis, Kentucky, Washington, Missouri, Blair, Nebraska, and Cedarburg, Wisconsin. Also in the village of Isio in the town of Cauayan, Negros Occidental, Philippines. The Jesuit-founded city of S√£o Borja, in southern Brazil, is named after him. Saint Francis Borgia Regional High School is located in Washington, Missouri.

Whereas TV Tome had TV shows and people pages, Movie Tome had movie guides. The website was created no later than August 2003 (the earliest archive) by John Nestoriak III, and was owned by Collaborative Content, LLC which was acquired by CNET in January 2005. Nestoriak continued to manage the site until early 2007, however. Movie Tome had six general forums in addition to a forum for each movie. The forums were About Movie Tome, In Theaters, On Video, In The Art House, Classic Movies and The Movie Industry. Each movie information page at Movie Tome included cast, crew, synopsis, notes, quotes, goofs, links, and a forum for discussion of the movie. There was also the ability to rate a movie from 1 to 10, the average vote being displayed on the left side of the guide, as well a link to reviews for the movie. Titles were added by users, and an individual user could request data manager status for titles he/she was interested in preserving from error or vandalism. The majority of titles on the site were of recent vintage, however, with a wide smattering of pre-2000 titles, largely American. All members of TV Tome were also members of Movie Tome. They retained their membership at Movie Tome when TV Tome was converted into TV.com. Generally, the editing and submission format was exactly the same as the original TV Tome. However, the site eventually showed interest only in new releases; submitted new titles for older films, even with an offer to serve as editor, were ignored by Nestoriak.. The new MovieTome On December 7, 2006, CNET launched a new version of the site, changing the name to FilmSpot.com (similar to the conversion of TV Tome to TV.com and probably in the same trend as GameSpot.com). The Movie Tome domain was permanently redirected to the new site on January 10, 2007. FilmSpot was a sister site to TV.com, GameSpot, and MP3.com. On November 14, 2007, the website name was reverted to MovieTome, after it was discovered that \\"MovieSpot\\" was already a registered domain name of MGM. Since the 2006 operational takeover by CNET, the site had been in \\"beta stage\\". No information was provided as to how long this stage would last, but all user activities had therewith been frozen. Users may have accessed information already on the site as of the end of 2006, but could add nothing. Even the \\"Community Forums\\" were locked, and, unlike other user-driven sections, could not be accessed beyond an index of the forums in operation at the time of the CNET operational takeover. Registered users from the original Movie Tome were still carried, but could not even add to their own profiles. A message at the bottom of each user-specific page claimed that the user was \\"in a pending, suspended or banned status\\". This was not further explained. There were no instructions on how to use the site, e.g. that to search for a movie, you had to enter the title in all lower-case letters, each word in the title connected by a _ . No \\"Contact Information\\" was provided for the site and there was no page identifying any of the site staff. MovieTome was unexpectedly shut down on November 29, 2010, redirecting all MovieTome URLs to the Movies section of Metacritic. The reason for this was a dire lack of visitors and popularity. =Rating system= As it was still in the beta stage, MovieTome had yet to offer its own reviews; however, they used Metacritic's average score. The score was based on a five-star system, similar to other movie review sites. MovieTome staff had made small reviews of movies on their \\"In Focus\\" section, but they were not given a score and were not listed on the movie's page, so the reviews were not considered official.

The games were first developed to be played with questions read from trivia cards or viewed on a television from an included DVD or based on clips from movies, TV shows, music videos, sports and other popular culture phenomena. Scene It? was made available as a mobile game for iPhone, iPad, on Xbox 360, PlayStation and Wii as well as two social network games on Facebook. Gameplay Players choose either a short or long game, and adjust the Flextime game board. For a short game, the board is folded so fewer spaces show. Each player throws a six-sided die to see who goes first. Then, the player rolls both the ordinary die and a customized eight-sided \\"category die\\" to see how far they move, and what challenge they face. The challenge can range from a trivia card question, a DVD challenge, (\\"My Play\\" or \\"All Play\\"), or they may have to draw a \\"Buzz card\\" (Cards are often renamed in special editions such as a \\"Prime Directive\\" card in Star Trek Scene It?). If the roller wins the challenge, they can go again, but if they lose, the dice are handed to the next player. This process keeps going until someone hits the All Play to Win stop sign, in which that player must win one final All Play, in which everyone participates, in order to win. If not, they go to ring 3 of the zone called Final Cut. There they must answer 3 questions right. If that falls through, then on the next turn they only have to answer 2 questions, and if they fail that as well, they answer 1 question on every following turn. If a Final Cut challenge is won, then they win the game, and they get to watch a victory scene on the DVD.  Optreve DVD Enhancement Technology  All versions of Scene It?, excluding the video game iterations, use a DVD that is designed to reshuffle itself every time it is inserted into the DVD player. In some instances, the DVD player may reset the system, and in this case, the DVD will reshuffle itself before returning players to the game menu. If a question from a previous game is shown in the same session, players can hit the \\"Return\\" button on their remote in order to start a new question. Some DVD players do not support this technology, but players can choose from 20-25 (depends on version) pre-set games to play. As their title suggests, these game sets are not random, and stay constant, no matter how many times the DVD is reset. Dave Long The creator, Dave Long, made the first prototype of Scene It? in 1992, when he placed several hit films on a VHS tape and had guests identify them as quickly as possible when they played on screen. He spent the next few years developing it into a game on DVD since VHS at the time had too many restrictions. In 2000, Dave finalized the DVD and named it 'Reel to Real', he then contacted local investors to bring his game onto shelves. After setting a brand, Scene It? was released to the public in 2002. And the hit game was turned into a series.

The first sequel, Scene It? Box Office Smash was released on October 28, 2008, featuring the new Xbox 360 Avatars. A second sequel, Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen! was released on November 17, 2009 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. Opting for a multi-platform approach, this title abandoned the avatars in favor of more generic characters. After Scene It? Twilight, a third sequel, Scene It? Movie Night was released on November 30, 2011 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Two unsuccessful, web-only versions of the game, Scene It? Online, and Scene It? Daily, were made available online, on Facebook, and on mobile platforms. Scene It? Online borrowed strongly from the DVD games' format, including video clips, sound clips, and puzzles. Scene It? Daily was predominantly text based, and represented a major departure from the multimedia-centric roots of the series.

He was a minister in the Howard Government from 2003 to 2007. Early life Campbell was born in Perth, Western Australia and lived for a time in Brisbane where he attended Brisbane Grammar School. He was a commercial and industrial property consultant and company director before entering politics. Politics Campbell was chosen by the parliament of Western Australia on 16 May 1990 to replace retiring Senator Fred Chaney. He was elected in his own right in 1993, 1998 and 2004. He was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1994‚Äì96. In government, he served in numerous roles: Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (1996); Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (1996); Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (1996); Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (1996‚Äì98); Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (1998‚Äì2001); and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (2001‚Äì03). He was responsible for overseeing the federal government's preparations for the Y2K bug. He was involved in presenting the bill that became the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Campbell also later served as Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (2003‚Äì04), Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2004‚Äì07), and Minister for Human Services (2007). =Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2004‚Äì07)= In July 2004, a pre-election reshuffle saw Campbell become Minister for the Environment and Heritage. In this role, he acknowledged the need for action on climate change but argued that it was important to consider environmental issues in an economic context. Amid growing community concern over the issue, he also argued for a \\"post-Kyoto arrangement that is effective\\" and a \\"portfolio approach\\" to the issue, rejecting the notion of \\"silver bullet\\" solutions. Campbell was a vigorous critic of whaling. Through the International Whaling Commission, he actively campaigned against commercial and \\"scientific\\" whaling. In 2006, Campbell drew criticism for blocking a wind farm project in south-eastern Victoria on the basis that it may pose a risk to the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. Commentators and the opposition rejected the decision as inconsistent and politically motivated. In 2006, Campbell was criticised for the approval of the Cloud Break mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, because of the number of endangered species in the area of the future mine, among them the incredibly rare night parrot.Campbell stands by Cloud Break mine approval ABC News, published: 24 July 2006, accessed: 9 November 2010 =Minister for Human Services (2007)= In January 2007, a cabinet reshuffle saw Campbell appointed Minister for Human Services, which was elevated to a cabinet position. However, on 3 March 2007, Campbell resigned after revelations he had met disgraced former Western Australian Premier Brian Burke. The resignation came in the midst of Liberal Party attacks on Opposition leader Kevin Rudd for also having met with Mr Burke, and was seen as a strategy to pressure and undermine Rudd. Prime Minister John Howard defended Campbell from charges of any moral wrongdoing, despite deputy leader Peter Costello's claim in Parliament that anyone who dealt with Brian Burke was morally compromised. Campbell announced his retirement from politics on 4 May 2007, saying that the Prime Minister had told him the door was still open for a return to the cabinet, but that he had decided to pursue a career in the private sector. The Liberal Party in Western Australia chose Mathias Cormann to take his place. Campbell formally resigned his Senate seat on 31 May 2007.

In the eye, it stimulates the nerves of the lacrimal gland to produce tears. Common lachrymators both currently and formerly used as tear gas include pepper spray (OC gas), PAVA spray (nonivamide), CS gas, CR gas, CN gas (phenacyl chloride), bromoacetone, xylyl bromide and Mace (a branded mixture). While lachrymatory agents are commonly deployed for riot control by law enforcement and military personnel, its use in warfare is prohibited by various international treaties.E.g. the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibited the use of \\"asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials\\". During World War I, increasingly toxic and deadly lachrymatory agents were used. Exposure to tear gas agents may produce numerous short-term and long-term health effects, including development of respiratory illnesses, severe eye injuries and diseases (such as traumatic optic neuropathy, keratitis, glaucoma, and cataracts), dermatitis, damage of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, and death, especially in cases with exposure to high concentrations of tear gas or application of the tear gases in enclosed spaces.Tear gas: an epidemiological and mechanistic reassessment by Jeffrey D. Laskin, Craig Rothenberg, Satyanarayana Achanta, Erik R. Svendsen, and Sven‚ÄêEric Jordt Effects  2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile is the active agent in CS gas. Tear gas generally consists of aerosolized solid or liquid compounds (bromoacetone or xylyl bromide), not gas. Tear gas works by irritating mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. It causes crying, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing, pain in the eyes, and temporary blindness. With CS gas, symptoms of irritation typically appear after 20 to 60 seconds of exposure and commonly resolve within 30 minutes of leaving (or being removed from) the area. =Risks= As with all non-lethal or less-lethal weapons, there is some risk of serious permanent injury or death when tear gas is used. This includes risks from being hit by tear gas cartridges that may cause severe bruising, loss of eyesight, or skull fracture, resulting in immediate death. A case of serious vascular injury from tear gas shells has also been reported from Iran, with high rates of associated nerve injury (44%) and amputation (17%), as well as instances of head injuries in young people. While the medical consequences of the gases themselves are typically limited to minor skin inflammation, delayed complications are also possible. People with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma are particularly at risk. They are likely to need medical attention and may sometimes require hospitalization or even ventilation support. Skin exposure to CS may cause chemical burns or induce allergic contact dermatitis. When people are hit at close range or are severely exposed, eye injuries involving scarring of the cornea can lead to a permanent loss in visual acuity. Frequent or high levels of exposure carry increased risks of respiratory illness. In the 2019‚Äì20 Chilean protests various people have suffered complete and permanent loss of vision in one or both eyes as result of the impact of tear gas grenades. =Site of Action= TRPA1 ion channels expressed on nociceptors have been implicated as the site of action for CS gas, CR gas, CN gas (phenacyl chloride) and bromoacetone in rodent models. Use =Warfare= During World War I, various forms of tear gas were used in combat and tear gas was the most common form of chemical weapon used. None of the belligerents believed that the use of irritant gases violated the Hague Convention of 1899 which prohibited the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare. Use of chemical weapons escalated during the war to lethal gases, after 1914 (during which only tear gas was used). The US Chemical Warfare Service developed tear gas grenades for use in riot control in 1919. Use of tear gas in warfare, as with all other chemical weapons, was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925: it prohibited the use of \\"asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials\\", a treaty that most states have signed. Police and civilian self- defense use is not banned in the same manner. Tear gas was used in combat by Italy in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, by Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Spain in the Rif War and by the United States in the Vietnam War.100 Years of Tear Gas, The Atlantic, August 16, 2014 Tear gas exposure is an element of military training programs, typically as a means of improving trainees' tolerance to tear gas and encouraging confidence in the ability of their issued protective equipment to prevent chemical weapons exposure. =Riot control= Certain lachrymatory agents, most notably tear gas, are often used by police to force compliance. In some countries (e.g., Finland, Australia, and United States), another common substance is mace. The self- defense weapon form of mace is based on pepper spray which comes in small spray cans. Versions including CS are manufactured for police use. Xylyl bromide, CN and CS are the oldest of these agents. CS is the most widely used. CN has the most recorded toxicity. Typical manufacturer warnings on tear gas cartridges state \\"Danger: Do not fire directly at person(s). Severe injury or death may result.\\" Tear gas guns do not have a manual setting to adjust the range of fire. The only way to adjust the projectile's range is to aim towards the ground at the correct angle. Incorrect aim will send the capsules away from the targets, causing risk for non-targets instead.Turkish Doctors' Association, 16 June 2013, T√úRK TABƒ∞PLERƒ∞ Bƒ∞RLƒ∞ƒûƒ∞‚ÄôNDEN ACƒ∞L √áAƒûRI! =Counter-measures= A variety of protective equipment may be used, including gas masks and respirators. In riot control situations, protesters sometimes use equipment (aside from simple rags or clothing over the mouth) such as swimming goggles and adapted water bottles. Activists in United States, Czech Republic, Venezuela and Turkey have reported using antacid solutions such as Maalox diluted with water to repel effects of tear gas attacks with Venezuelan chemist M√≥nica Kr√§uter recommending the usage of diluted antacids as well as baking soda. There have also been reports of these antacids being helpful for tear gas, and for capsaicin-induced skin pain. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, frontline protesters became adept at extinguishing tear gas: they formed special teams that spring into action as soon as it is fired. These individuals generally wear protective clothing, including heat-proof gloves, or cover their arms and legs with cling film to prevent the painful skin irritation. Canisters are sometimes picked up and lobbed back at police or extinguished straight away with water, or neutralised using objects such as traffic cones. They share information about models of 3M respirator filters which have been found to be most effective against tear gas, and where those models could be purchased. Other volunteers carry saline solutions to rinse the eyes of those affected. Similarly Chilean protesters of Primera L√≠nea have specialized individuals collecting and extinguishing the tear gas grenades. Others act as tear gas medics while yet another group, the so-called shield-bearers protect the protesters from the direct physical impact of the grenades. Treatment A paramedic tending to an opposition protester during the 2014 Venezuelan protests There is no specific antidote to common tear gases. Getting clear of gas and into fresh air is the first line of action. Removing contaminated clothing and avoiding shared use of contaminated towels could help reduce skin reactions. Immediate removal of contact lenses has also been recommended, as they can retain particles. Once a person has been exposed, there are a variety of methods to remove as much chemical as possible and relieve symptoms. The standard first aid for burning solutions in the eye is irrigation (spraying or flushing out) with water. There are reports that water may increase pain from CS gas, but the balance of limited evidence currently suggests water or saline are the best options. Some evidence suggests that Diphoterine, a hypertonic amphoteric salt solution, a first aid product for chemical splashes, may help with ocular burns or chemicals in the eye. Bathing and washing the body vigorously with soap and water can remove particles that adhere to the skin. Clothes, shoes and accessories that come into contact with vapors must be washed well since all untreated particles can remain active for up to a week. Some advocate using fans or hair dryers to evaporate the spray, but this has not been shown to be better than washing out the eyes and it may spread contamination. Anticholinergics can work like some antihistamines as they reduce lacrymation and decrease salivation, acting as an antisialagogue, and for overall nose discomfort as they are used to treat allergic reactions in the nose (e.g., itching, runny nose, and sneezing). Oral analgesics may help relieve eye pain. = Home remedies = Vinegar, petroleum jelly, milk and lemon juice solutions have also been used by activists. It is unclear how effective these remedies are. In particular, vinegar itself can burn the eyes and prolonged inhalation can also irritate the airways. Though vegetable oil and vinegar have also been reported as helping relieve burning caused by pepper spray, Kr√§uter suggests the usage of baking soda or toothpaste, stating that they trap the particles emanating from the gas near the airways that are more feasible to inhale. A small trial of baby shampoo for washing out the eyes did not show any benefit.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the Winnipeg riding of Seven Oaks for the Manitoba Liberal Party. Early years and education He was born in New York City, New York. Minenko's father was the Very Rev. Tymofiy Minenko, a Ukrainian-born priest in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church; his mother was Anastasia Krywonos. He was raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba. He worked as a lawyer, and also joined the Canadian Forces Medical Services in 1976, eventually reaching the rank of Captain. He was awarded the Canada Forces Decoration in 1988. Political career In 1981, Minenko worked an assistant to MLA June Westbury, who was at the time the only Liberal representative in the provincial legislature. Minenko first ran for provincial office in the election of 1988, scoring an upset victory over outgoing New Democratic Finance Minister Eugene Kostyra in Seven Oaks. Minenko won the election by 332 votes, at a time when provincial support for the NDP was at its lowest ebb since the 1960s. He was named as Deputy Speaker on July 21, 1988, but resigned on May 18, 1989. In the provincial election of 1990, redistribution forced him to run in the riding of St. Johns against another incumbent, New Democrat Judy Wasylycia-Leis. He lost, by almost two thousand votes, amid a general decline in support for the Liberal Party. He has not sought a return to provincial politics since this time. Minenko later became active in the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, and has sought a formal apology from the federal government for the detainment of Ukrainians in concentration camps during the First World War. He also continued his education at the University of Alberta, working towards a Master of Laws degree. =Election results= References Manitoba Liberal Party MLAs 1957 births Living people Canadian people of Ukrainian descent ","title":"Mark Minenko"},{"id":"1202670","title":"Brian Schweitzer"},{"id":"1202679","text":"James McMullan (26 March 1895 ‚Äì 28 November 1964) was a Scottish football player and manager. He won 16 Scotland caps as a player at half-back and was part of the famous \\"Wembley Wizards\\" side of 1928. Playing career =Early life and Third Lanark= McMullan was born in Denny, Stirlingshire in 1895. He began his football career with junior side Denny Hibernian in 1911 before graduating to the Scottish League with Third Lanark the next year. Initially considered an inside left, by the time he left in 1913 he was playing predominantly as a left half. =Partick Thistle and Maidstone= He joined Thirds' Glasgow rivals Partick Thistle in 1913.[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 He stayed eight seasons with Thistle but missed out on participating in their Scottish Cup-winning side of 1921 through injury.Scottish Cup Final Partick Thistle's First Victory, The Glasgow Herald, 18 April 1921 In the close season of 1921 McMullan became embroiled in controversy.

Tommy Browell scored the goal for City in that game. Despite containing a number of England players such as Frank Roberts, Billy Austin, Sam Cowan and Tommy Johnson, City finished in twenty-first place in the First Division that season and were relegated into the second division. McMullan played in the 1926 FA Cup Final defeat to Bolton Wanderers. McMullan scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 3‚Äì4 defeat to Southampton in the 1926‚Äì27 football season. City came third in the second division and were unable to earn promotion. In the 1927‚Äì28 football season McMullan helped City into first place in the second division, earning the team promotion. The team had been strengthened by the acquisition of both Eric Brook and Fred Tilson from Barnsley. McMullan reached an FA Cup final with City again in 1933 but the team were defeated by Everton 3‚Äì0. Many of his teammates would be part of the City team which won the FA Cup the following year. However, after 242 League and Cup appearances, McMullan departed Manchester City in May 1933. =International= In 1920 he won the first of his sixteen caps for Scotland against Wales in a 1‚Äì1 draw in the 1920 British Home Championship, having made unofficial appearances in the years prior during wartime. McMullan is considered to have been the greatest Scottish half-back of his day; he was an ever-present in the 1921 British Home Championship which was won by Scotland. McMullan helped Scotland to victory in the 1925 British Home Championship and was part of the Scotland team which defeated England 2‚Äì0. He was also part of the team which won the 1926 British Home Championship appearing in the 1‚Äì0 victory against England at Old Trafford and in the 3‚Äì0 victory against Wales at Ninian Park. In the 1927 British Home Championship, McMullan featured twice for Scotland in a 3‚Äì0 victory against Wales and a 2‚Äì1 defeat to England at Hampden Park. Despite this defeat, Scotland won the championship again that season. In the 1928 British Home Championship, McMullan captained Scotland as they defeated England 5‚Äì1 at Wembley Stadium with a hat-trick from Alex Jackson and a brace from Alex James. As a result of the resounding victory, the Scotland team were dubbed the \\"Wembley Wizards\\". Despite this victory Wales won the championship that season. McMullan captained Scotland to victory the following season in the 1929 British Home Championship. Managerial career McMullan joined Oldham Athletic as a player-manager in 1933. After a brief spell there, he was appointed the first-ever manager of Aston Villa in 1934 (before his appointment, the team was selected by a committee). However, the move proved disastrous, resulting in Villa's first ever relegation in 1935‚Äì36 after 61 years in the top flight. He later managed Notts County (1936‚Äì37) and Sheffield Wednesday (1937‚Äì1939). He died on 28 November 1964. Legacy McMullan is regarded as one of Manchester City's best ever players.

It is popular in Southeast Asia, mainly in Brunei, Indonesia (especially in Palembang), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. History The origin of Kaya Jam is unclear, but it is believed to have been brought over from Portugal during the occupation of Melaka in the 15th century. The cuisine is claimed to have been invented by Portuguese descendants of Melaka. The current coconut jam served in southeast Asia, is highly similar to the Portuguese traditional cuisine, Doce De Ovos (Sweet egg cream). Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore A close-up of Kaya showing texture The word for coconut jam in the Malay language, kaya, means rich, referencing the texture of the popular food. For Malaysians, Indonesians and Singaporeans, kaya, also called srikaya (coconut egg jam), is a sweet creamy coconut spread made from coconut milk (locally known as santan) and duck or chicken eggs (which are flavored with pandan leaf and sweetened with sugar). The resulting color varies depending on the color of the egg yolks, the amount of pandan, and the extent of the caramelization of the sugar. As a popular local spread, kaya is typically spread on toast to make kaya toast and eaten in the morning, but is also enjoyed throughout the day. Kaya can be found in most kopitiam and night markets. Different varieties available include the nyonya kaya, which is of a lighter-green color, and Hainanese kaya, which is of a darker brown and uses caramelized sugar, and is often further sweetened with honey. In Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, kaya is also used as a topping for several desserts including pulut taitai or pulut tekan, a dessert of sweet glutinous rice colored blue with butterfly pea flowers (bunga telang), and pulut seri muka, a similar dessert but colored green due to adding pandan leaves. It is also used with glutinous rice to make kuih seri kaya. Philippines Philippine coconut jam is known as matam√≠s sa b√°o (also matam√≠s na b√°o or minatam√≠s na b√°o, among other names). The names literally mean \\"sweetened coconut\\". It is different from other Southeast Asian versions in that it uses coconut cream (kakang gata, the first and second press of grated coconut meat) and cane sugar extract or molasses (treacle). It also does not use eggs and thus is more like syrup rather than custard. It is often eaten on toast or pandesal or used as a filling for pan de coco. When it is mixed with ground glutinous rice paste, it becomes a popular dessert known as kalamay. A less viscous version made with coconut milk (gata) is known as latik (anglicized as \\"coconut caramel\\"), and is used in place of syrup in numerous native Filipino desserts. Thailand pandan-flavored coconut jam sold in Southeast Asia The kaya of Thailand is called sangkhaya (, ) in Thai. There are two major types of kaya eaten in Thailand. One type is more liquid than the other, while the less thick kaya is similar to what is eaten in Malaysia and Indonesia. People either spread it on steamed or toasted bread or dip the bread into kaya. This kind of kaya is commonly sold by street vendors but has recently been brought into tea and coffee shops. Another type is a concoction that has a less sticky and more custard-like texture. It is sometimes called \\"coconut custard\\" in English and is used to make sangkhaya fakthong (, ; sangkhaya maryu in Lao), sangkhaya pumpkin or custard pumpkin, khao niao sangkhaya (, ), glutinous rice topped with sangkhaya, and sangkhaya maphrao (, ), sangkhaya served in a coconut.

It was a two-stage rocket, consisting of a Thor IRBM as a first stage and a Vanguard- derived Able second stage. On some flights, an Altair solid rocket motor was added as a third stage. It was a member of the Thor family and an early predecessor of the Delta. Launches Sixteen Thor-Able were launched, nine on sub-orbital re-entry vehicle test flights and seven on orbital satellite launch attempts. Six launches resulted in failures, in which three of those failures were the result of an Altair upper stage added to the rocket to allow it to launch the spacecraft onto a trans-lunar trajectory. All sixteen launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17A. Airframes The Thor-Able vehicle had a stronger airframe than the standard Thor IRBM and had the inertial guidance system replaced by a radio guidance package mounted on the Able stages. It saw its first test on 23 April 1958 when Vehicle 116 was launched from LC-17A with a biological nose cone containing a mouse named MIA (Mouse In Able). At 19:10 EST, the Thor's engine roared to life and drove the Able stage and its tiny passenger into the evening sky. Two minutes and fifteen seconds after launch, at an altitude of 50 miles (80 km), the Thor exploded and sent the hapless rodent into the Atlantic Ocean instead of space. The cause of the failure was traced to a turbopump bearing coming loose and resulting in pump shutdown and instant loss of thrust. With no attitude control, the Thor pitched down and its LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads. On 9 July, Thor 118 lifted off for a second attempt with a mouse named MIA II. The booster, including the unproven Able stage, performed successfully and the biological nose cone was driven back into the atmosphere for a splashdown in the South Atlantic, but recovery crews failed to locate the capsule and it sank into the ocean. A third attempt was made on 23 July. The press refused to call the mouse by the name of MIA III, so she was instead christened \\"Wickie\\", after a local female news reporter who had covered the space program at Cape Canaveral. Unfortunately, Wickie was no luckier than her predecessors when recovery crews once again failed to locate the capsule after splashdown, but telemetry data confirmed the mouse's survival from liftoff through reentry and proved comprehensively that living organisms could survive space travel. Attention now turned to Thor-Able 127 and Pioneer 0, the world's first lunar probe. This flight took place on 17 August, but ended embarrassingly when the Thor exploded 77 seconds into the launch due to another turbopump malfunction. After an Atlas missile test a month later also failed due to the turbopumps, the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division quickly replaced the pumps in all of their missiles and this problem did not repeat itself again. On 10 October, Pioneer 1 was launched on Thor 130. The second stage shut down too early and the probe did not have sufficient velocity to escape Earth's gravity. It re-entered the atmosphere and burned up 43 hours after launch. Pioneer 2 was launched on 8 November and reentered the atmosphere less than an hour after launch when the third stage failed to ignite. The next six Thor-Able flights were suborbital tests for the Air Force (23 January, 28 February, 21 March, 8 April, 20 May, and 11 June 1959). All of these were successful except the first one, which failed to stage due to an electrical problem and fell into the Atlantic Ocean. On 7 August, Explorer 6 (a scientific satellite) was launched on Vehicle 134 and successfully orbited. On 17 September, Transit 1A failed to orbit due to the third stage again failing to ignite. On 3 November, Pioneer 5 was successfully launched. Intended originally as a Venus probe, technical delays caused it to be launched after the 1959 Venus window had closed so that it was instead sent into a heliocentric orbit. The final Thor-Able launch orbited Tiros-1 on 1 April 1960. The Able upper stage name represents its place as the first in the series, from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet.

Career Beginning in 1896, he worked as trading official, a job that involved a good deal of travel in Europe. He worked for a time as a newspaper editor in Beirut and, later, in Cairo. He also worked as a teacher and became involved in political and social activism. In addition, he began to write and publish poetry. His first collection of poems, The Wonders, was published in Paris in 1901. From his base in Cairo, he wrote frequently for Armenian periodicals in the West, and in 1905 he founded the periodical Shirak, which published the work of many writers in the Armenian diaspora. After the collapse of the dictatorial regime of Abdul Hamid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1909, Tekeyan moved from Cairo to Constantinople, where he continued to publish Shirak and became an established public figure in Constantinople. When the First World War began in 1914, Tekeyan happened to be in Egypt, which enabled him to escape the bloodshed. Eventually, however, he did return to Constantinople, where he edited a newspaper, Voice of the People, then served as director of the Central School. Political tumult in Constantinople ultimately drove him back to Egypt, where he edited the daily newspaper Arev until the end of his life. Tekeyan's poems include: The Armenian Church, A Prayer on the Eve of Tomorrow, Your Memory Tonight, When the Day Finally Comes, and Your Name. His later collections of poetry include The Wonderful Renaissance (1914), Midnight to the Dawn (1919), Love (1933), Hayerghutyun (1943), and Tagharan (1944). He also translated works by Shakespeare, Victor Hugo, and Oscar Wilde into Armenian. He died in 1945 in Cairo, where he is buried at the Armenian cemetery. Legacy He is regarded in Armenian literary circles as the \\"Prince of Armenian Poetry,\\" as his poetry, especially his sonnets, are masterpieces of Armenian literature.Biography (in Armenian) Tekeyan's themes in poetry revolved mostly around love, such as compassionate love, love for one's homeland, or love for humanity. Another Armenian intellectual and poet, Vahe Vahian, was heavily influenced by Vahan Tekeyan's work, from where his pen-name came from. His Complete Works, in nine volumes, were published in Cairo in 1949-50. Volumes of selected works was issued in Beirut in 1954 and in Yerevan in 1970. A collection of his letters was published in Los Angeles in 1983. The Tekeyan Cultural Association, the most important institution of its kind in the Armenian diaspora was founded in 1947 in Beirut, and now has branches around the world.Vahan Tekeyan (1878-1945); BnF; Who Is Who?; Armenian Biographical Encyclopedia, Vol. 1; Yerevan, 2005 Books * Sacred wrath: The selected poems, transl.

It is situated a short distance south of the border with Warwickshire approximately five miles southeast of Rugby. According to the 2001 census Kilsby had a population of 1,221, including Barby Nortoft but decreasing to 1,196 at the 2011 census. The village has grown moderately since the 1960s, with a mix of new housing developments and a degree of in-filling. It retains a historic core of attractive buildings including some fine examples of Northamptonshire rubble stone construction, and a number of thatched property's. A Conservation area was designated in the village in 2018, and many of the villages more attractive property's are Listed for their historic interest. Amenities include an Ofsted \\"Good\\" rated primary school, two pubs, The Red Lion and The George (currently closed) and two churches - Church of England and URC. The Village also has a volunteer run community- owned shop in the car park of the Red Lion pub. This warm community spirit is also evident in a number of thriving community groups, including Womans Institute, Brownies, Girl Guides, as well as a good neighbour community support scheme born out of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown and the Kilsby Kronicle village newspaper. The parish's eastern side is bounded by the old route of the Roman Watling Street, and the village itself is sited on the crossing of two former mediaeval drove-routes.Kilsby village website It gives its name to the Kilsby Tunnel on the West Coast Main Line. The tunnel measures 1 mile 666 yards (2,216 m). Between 1881 and 1960, the village used to have a railway station Kilsby and Crick station but this was on the Northampton Loop about a mile (1.5 km) from the village. The village is circa 10 minutes from both Long Buckby and Rugby stations, the latter offering direct services into London Euston in 49 minutes. One of the village's more unusual claims to fame is that the A361 road terminates here at a junction with the A5. The A361 runs to Ilfracombe in Devon making it the longest 'three-digit' road in Britain. A consequence of these roads is that the majority of through traffic bypasses the heart of the village ensuring the main road through the village is relatively quiet. Kilsby's name comes from Anglo-Saxon + old Norse , literally meaning \\"child's dwelling\\", but \\"child\\" here probably means \\"young nobleman\\". Its church, St Faith's, may originally have been the daughter chapel of the neighbouring parish of Barby. \\"Kilsby Jones\\" is the name by which James Rhys Jones is usually known. He was a Welsh congregationalist minister and writer in Kilsby from 1840 to about 1850, when he moved to Birmingham. References External links {{Commons categoryKilsby *Kilsby C.E.

The term jicarilla comes from Mexican Spanish meaning \\"little basket\\", referring to the small sealed baskets they used as drinking vessels. To neighboring Apache bands, such as the Mescalero and Lipan, they were known as Kinya-Inde (\\"People who live in fixed houses\\"). The Jicarilla called themselves also Haisndayin translated as \\"people who came from below\\", because they believed themselves to be the sole descendants of the first people to emerge from the underworld, the abode of Ancestral Man and Ancestral Woman, who produced the first people. The Jicarilla Apache lived in a seminomadic existence in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and plains of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico, and ranged into the Great Plains starting before 1525 CE. They lived a relatively peaceful life for years, traveling seasonally to traditional hunting, gathering and cultivation along river beds. The Jicarilla learned about farming and pottery from the Puebloan peoples and learned about survival on the plains from the Plains Indians and had a rich and varied diet and lifestyle.The Jicarilla's farming practices expanded to the point where they required considerable time and energy. As a result, the people became rather firmly settled and tended to engage in warfare less frequently than did other Eastern Apache groups. Starting in the 1700s colonial New Spain, pressure from other Native American tribes, such as the Comanches, and later westward expansion of the United States resulted in significant loss of property, expulsion from their sacred lands, and relocation to lands not suited for survival. The mid-1800s until the mid-1900s were particularly difficult, as tribal bands were displaced, treaties made and broken, subject to significant loss of life due to tuberculosis and other diseases, and lack of opportunities for survival. By 1887, they received their reservation, which was expanded in 1907 to include land more conducive to ranching and agriculture, and within several decades, they realized the rich natural resources of the San Juan Basin under the reservation land. Tribal members transitioned from a seminomadic lifestyle and are now supported by their oil and gas, casino gaming, forestry, ranching, and tourism industries on the reservation. The Jicarilla continue to be known for their pottery, basketry, and beadwork. History =Early history= The Jicarilla Apaches are one of the Athabaskan linguistic groups that migrated out of Canada, by 1525 CE, and possibly several hundred or more years earlier,Carlisle, pp. 3, 45-46. and lived in what they considered their land bounded by four sacred rivers in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado: the Rio Grande, Pecos River, Arkansas River, and Canadian River containing sacred mountain peaks and ranges. Large numbers of them lived also along the Cimarron River and ranged out into the plains of northwestern Texas and the western portions of Oklahoma and Kansas.Carlisle, pages 4-5.Velarde Tiller, 28. Their territory overlapped that of several other tribes. They were found to be in the Chama Valley, New Mexico, and points east by the 1600s. Prior to that time, and the arrival of the Spanish, the Jicarilla lived a relatively peaceful existence.Pritzker, 12. Culturally, the Jicarilla were heavily influenced by the Plains Indians to their east and the Pueblo Indians to their west, with the result that their own culture exhibited a combination of nomadic hunting and settled farming characteristics. One of the Plains Indian traits prominent in Jicarilla culture was an emphasis on raiding and warfare. After Spanish contact, raiding increased in frequency and intensity with the use of and need for horses. In the 1600s, the Jicarillas were seminomadic, practicing seasonal agriculture that they learned from the Pueblo people and Spaniards of New Spain along the rivers that flow through their territory.Greenwald, 97. The Apache are linked to the Dismal River culture of the western Plains,Cassells, pp. 236.. generally attributed to the Paloma and Quartelejo (also Cuartelejo) Apaches. Jicarilla Apache pottery has also been found in some of the Dismal River complex sites.Gibbon, p. 213. Some of the people of the Dismal River culture joined the Kiowa Apache in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Due to pressure from the Comanche from the west and Pawnee and French from the east, the Kiowa and remaining people of Dismal River culture migrated south, where they later joined the Lipan Apache and Jicarilla Apache nations. By the 1800s, they were planting along the rivers, especially along the upper Arkansas River and its tributaries, a variety of crops, sometimes using irrigation to aid in growing squash, beans, pumpkins, melons, peas, wheat, and corn. They found farming in the mountains safer than on the open plains. They primarily hunted buffalo into the 17th century, and thereafter hunted antelope, deer, mountain sheep, elk, and buffalo. From the wild, women gathered berries, agave, honey, onions, potatoes, nuts, and seeds. =Sacred land and creation story= Apachean tribes ca. 18th century: WA ‚Äì Western Apache, N ‚Äì Navajo, Ch ‚Äì Chiricahua, M ‚Äì Mescalero, J ‚Äì Jicarilla, L ‚Äì Lipan, Pl ‚Äì Plains Apache From the Jicarilla creation story, the land bounded by the four sacred rivers was provided to them by the Creator, with select places for communicating with the Creator and spirits, sacred rivers and mountains to be respected and conserved, and very specific places for obtaining items for ceremonial rituals, such as white clay found southeast of Taos, red ochre north of Taos and yellow ochre on a mountain near Picuris Pueblo. They believe the \\"heart of the world\\" is located near Taos.Greenwald, 95-97.Velarde Tiller, 26-28. Traditional Jicarilla stories of White Shell Woman, Killer of the Enemies, Child of the Water and others feature places and nearby people special to them, such as the Rio Grande Gorge, Picuris Pueblo, the spring and marsh near El Prado, Hopewell Lake and particularly of the Taos Pueblo and the four sacred rivers. The Jicarilla created shrines in sites that held spiritual meaning, sharing some of the Taos area sites with the Taos Pueblo.Eiselt, 57-59. Of the connection to Taos, in 1865 Father Antonio Jos√© Mart√≠nez, a New Mexican priest, commented that the Jicarilla had a long history living between the mountains and the villages and making pottery as an important source of income. Clay for the pottery came from the Taos and Picuris Pueblo areas.Eiselt, 59-60. =Pressures for Jicarilla Apache land= Due to increase in other populations, Manifest Destiny, and Indian Wars, the Apaches' traditional cultural and economic lifestyle became strained. Many people died due to famine, Indian Wars, including the Battle of Cieneguilla and diseases not indigenous to the American continent for which they had no resistance. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the Jicarilla commonly raided the Plains tribes to their east and used the fruits of their successes to trade with the Pueblo Indians and the Spanish. When the Comanche, who had obtained guns from the French, with their close allies and kin, the Ute, were pushing out onto the plains, they were pillaging the various eastern Apache peoples (Jicarilla, Mescalero and Lipan) occupying the southern plains for control. As they were pushed off the plain, the Jicarilla moved to the mountains and near the pueblos and Spanish missions where they sought alliance with the Puebloan peoples and the Spanish settlers. For instance, in 1724 several Apache bands were annihilated by the Comanches who forced them to \\"give up half their women and children, and then they burned several villages, killing all but sixty- nine men, two women, and three boys.\\" The Jicarillas were forced to seek a refuge into the eastern Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of the Taos Pueblo in New Mexico. Some chose to move to the Pecos Pueblo in New Mexico or joined the Mescalero and Lipan bands in Texas.Carlisle, pp. 190-1, 260. In 1779 a combined force of Jicarilla, Ute, Pueblo, and Spanish soldiers defeated the Comanche, who, after another seven years and several more military campaigns, finally sued for peace. Thereafter the Jicarilla were able to reestablish themselves in their old tribal territory in southern Colorado.Jicarilla =Ollero and Llanero bands= The geography of the Jicarilla tribal territory consists of two fundamental environments which helped shape the basic social organization of the Tribe into two bands: the Llaneros, or plains people, and the Olleros, or mountain valley people.Griffin-Pierce, 380.Goddard, 8.Hook, Pegler, 116. Every September the two bands compete in ceremonial races during Gojiiya. After being pushed out of the plains by 1750, the Jicarilla became close allies of their former enemies - two bands of today's Southern Ute Tribe. * The Olleros, the mountain people - pottery making clan, a.k.a. Northern Jicarilla, lived west of the Rio Grande along the Chama River. of New Mexico and Colorado, settled down as farmers, became potters and lived partly in Pueblo-like villages (6 local groups). They began subsidizing their livelihood through sales of micaceous clay pottery and basketry and learned to farm from their Pueblo neighbors. Ollero is Spanish for \\"potters\\". Their autonym, or name for themselves, is Saidind√™ for \\"Sand People\\" or \\"Mountain People\\" or \\"Mountain Dwellers\\"; The Spanish rendering is Hoyeros meaning \\"mountain-valley people\\".Griffin-Pierce, 380.Goddard, 8.Hook, Pegler, 116. The Capote Band of Utes (Kapota, Kahpota), living east of the Great Divide south of the Conejos River and east of the Rio Grande west towards the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in the San Luis Valley, along the headwaters of the Rio Grande and along the Animas River, centering in the vicinity of today Chama and Tierra Amarilla of Rio Arriba County, joined in an alliance with the Olleros (like the Muache with the Llaneros) against the Southern Plains Tribes like the Comanche and Kiowa (their former allies) and Southern Arapaho and Southern Cheyenne and maintained trade relations to Puebloan peoplesThe Northern Utes of Utah * The Llaneros, the plains people clan, a.k.a. Eastern Jicarilla, lived as nomads in tipis, called kozhan by the Jicarilla, followed and hunted buffalo on the plains east of the Rio Grande centering along the headwaters of the Canadian River. During the winter they lived in the mountains between the Canadian River and the Rio Grande, camped and traded near Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico, Pecos, New Mexico and Taos, New Mexico (8 local groups). Their autonym, or name for themselves, is Gulgah√©n for \\"Plains People\\"; the Spanish picked it up as Llaneros - \\"Plains Dwellers\\".Goddard, 349-350. Their close allies were the Muache Band of Utes (Mouache, Mahgruhch, Mahgrahch, Muwac), living along the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains from Denver, Colorado in the north to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the south and who traded like the Llaneros with Taos Pueblo - therefore often called Taos- Ute- together the Jicarilla-Muache fought the enemy Comanche, Kiowa, Southern Arapaho and Southern Cheyenne onto the Southern Plains. =Battle of Cieneguilla= Southwestern Defense System before the Civil War. Source:National Park ServiceThe Battle of Cieneguilla (pronounced sienna-GEE- ya; English: small swamp) was an engagement of a group of Jicarilla Apaches, their Ute allies, and the American 1st Cavalry Regiment on March 30, 1854 Rajtar. near what is now Pilar, New Mexico.A losing battle - The Albuquerque Tribune Background By the mid-1800s tensions between the Spanish, multiple Native American nations and westward expanding United States settlers erupted as all sought and laid claim to land in the southwest. Diseases to which Native Americans had no immunity \\"decimated\\" their tribes, creating greater pressure for their lands to be taken from them. As tensions of Native Americans grew and numerous attempts to relocate them from their traditional hunting and gathering land and sacred homelands, the Jicarilla became increasingly hostile in their efforts to protect their lands.Oliva. By 1850 the Jicarillas comprised the most serious Indian threat to travelers on the Santa Fe Trail through northeastern New Mexico and to frontier settlers in that region. The United States military developed a defense system of forts and troops to restrict attacks on westward travelers. Fort Union was established, in part, to provide protection from the Jicarillas. The disruption and \\"mutual incomprehensions\\" of one another's culture led to warfare among the Spanish, Native American nations and Americans.Oliva. Leo E. Oliva, author of Fort Union and the Frontier Army in the Southwest, notes that: \\"The three cultural groups in the Southwest had different concepts of family life, personal values, social relations, religion, uses and ownership of land and other property, how best to obtain the provisions of life, and warfare.\\" Fort Union was established by Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner who ordered Major James Henry Carleton's Company K 1st Dragoons on August 2, 1851 to protect of westward travelers between Missouri and New Mexico territory on the Santa Fe Trail. New Mexico Territory's Governor William Carr Lane made treaties with the Jicarilla and other Native American tribes of New Mexico to relocate to reservations and peacefully take up agriculture on new lands and in agreed for payments to recompense for loss of access to their hunting, gathering and sacred homeland. The United States government, however, pulled the funding for this agreement, betraying the Native American tribal members. Further complicating the situation, all the crops planted by the tribal members failed and the people continued raiding for survival. Battle and aftermath Cenotaph marking where the body of a killed dragoon was found In March 1854 Lobo Blanco, a Jicarilla chief, led a band of 30 warriors to raid the horse herd of a contractor for Fort Union; a detachment of 2nd U.S. Dragoons, led by Lieutenant David Bell, pursued the raiders, engaging a fight on the Canadian River and killing many of them, including the chief, who was repeteadly wounded and finally killed by crushing him under a boulder (March 4).Haley, James L. \\"the Apaches: A History and Culture Portrait \\", University of Oklahoma Press Norman 1981, On the end of march, Maj. George A. Blake, commanding officer at Burgwin Cantonment, sent a detachment of 1st U.S. Dragoon of 60 men (company I and part of company F) to patrol along the Santa Fe trail, and on March 30, 1854, a combined force of about 250 Apaches and Utes fought the U.S. dragoons, led by Lieutenant John Wynn Davidson, near Pilar, New Mexico, then known as Cieneguilla.Davidson, 72. The battle lasted for 2,Gorenfeld, Will. or 4 hours according to surviving soldier James A. Bennett (aka James Bronson). The Jicarilla, led by their principal chief, Francisco Chacon, and Flechas Rayadas, fought with flintlock rifles and arrows, killing 22 and a wounding another 36 of 60 dragoon soldiers, who then retreated to Ranchos de Taos lighter by 22 horses and most of the troops' supplies.Brooks, Reeve, Bennett. Haley, James L. Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke of the 2nd Dragoons Regiment at once organized an expedition to pursue the Jicarilla. With the help of 32 Pueblo Indian and Mexican scouts under Captain James H. Quinn, with Kit Carson as the principal guide. After a winter pursuit through the mountains, Cooke caught up with the Jicarilla, whose leader, Flechas Rayadas offered an agreement for peace in exchange for the horses and guns the Jicarilla acquired from the Battle, but the arrangement was not accepted. On April 8, Cooke Chief fought tribal members at their camp in the canyon of Ojo Caliente. Dispersing in small bands, the Jicarilla evaded further pursuit, but many died from the harsh cold weather.Carter, 134-139. Haley, James L. A large unit under Maj. James H. Carleton fought again the Jicarillas near Fisher's Peak, in the Raton Mountains, killing several Jicarillas, and Francisco Chacon replied by trying an ambush against the soldiers with 150 warriors, but the Jicarillas were bypassed: five warriors were killed and six wounded, and seventeen among women and children were scattered and probably died of cold and hunger during the flight. Haley, James L.In May, Francisco Chacon sent word to Santa Fe for peace and surrendered at Abiquiu. Haley, James L. Part of the Jicarillas went north and joined their allies, the Muache and Kahpota Utes. =Jicarilla reservation= Portrait of a Jicarilla man, 1904 Portrait of a Jicarilla maiden, 1905 Following westward expansion of the United States and the resulting impacts to their livelihoods, attempts began in the mid-1850s to relocate the Jicarilla Apache, who became increasingly hostile to these pressures. In addition, relations with the Spanish also became hostile when the Spanish captured and sold Apache tribal members into slavery. After years of warfare, broken treaties, relocation and being the only southwestern tribe without a reservation, the two Jicarilla Llanero and Ollero bands united in 1873 and sent a delegation to Washington, D.C. to appeal for a reservation. Eventually United States President Grover Cleveland created the Jicarilla Apache Reservation through a United States executive order signed on February 11, 1887.Pritzker, 12-13. Although the Olleros and the Llaneros opposed each other over the location of the Jicarilla Reservation when they had finally obtained it, it was spiritually disheartening to realize that they would no longer roam on their traditional holy lands and have access to the sacred places. Once settled, they occupied separate areas of the Reservation. The animosities stemming from this period have persisted into the twentieth century, with the Olleros usually identified as progressives and the Llaneros as conservatives.Jicarilla - Sociopolitical organization The land on the reservation, except that held by non-tribal members, was not suitable for agriculture. As a means of survival, timber from the reservation was sold. In 1907 additional land was secured for the reservation, for a total of , that was suitable for sheep ranching which became profitable in the 1920s. Until that time, many people suffered from malnutrition and up to 90% of the tribe members had tuberculosis in 1914; By the 1920s it seemed likely that the Jicarilla Apache nation may become extinct due to trachoma, tuberculosis, and other diseases. After several difficult ranching periods, many of the previous sheep herders relocated to the tribal headquarters in Dulce, New Mexico. The Jicarilla suffered due to lack of economic opportunities for decades.Pritzker, 13.Griffin-Pierce, 381. Oil and gas development began on the reservation after World War II resulting in up to $1 million annually, some of which was set aside for a tribal scholarship fund and to develop the Stone Lake Lodge facility. In 1982, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, that the tribe had the authority to impose severance taxes on oil companies that were drilling for oil and natural gas on reservation land.Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, As a means of repayment for lost tribal lands, the Jicarilla received a settlement in 1971 for $9.15 million. The Jicarilla Apache made a claim for compensation to the U.S. Government when the Indian Claims Commission was created.Indian Claims Commission. Jicarilla Apache Tribe of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, Vol. 25, Docket 22-A, p.248-49. A two-volume technical report was submitted to the Commission on Spanish and Mexican grants, both unconfirmed and confirmed as part of the case.Howard F.

Jicarilla Apache Tribe of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, Vol. 25, Docket 22-A, p.248-49 Tribal government Present location Apache peoples including Jicarilla. The Jicarilla Apache are a federally recognized tribal entity who in 1937 organized a formal government and adopted a constitution. Traditional tribal leaders were elected as their first tribal council members.Pritzker, 14-15. In 2000 the tribe officially changed their name to the Jicarilla Apache Nation.Velarde Tiller, 124.Warren, Tiller, 16. Veronica E. Velarde Tiller, author of Culture and Customs of the Apache Indians writes: \\"All the powers of the tribal governments reflected the traditional values of the Apache people. The protection, preservation, and conservation of the bounty of 'Mother Earth', and all its inhabitants is sacred value shared by all Indian people, and the Apaches were most eager to have this concept incorporated into their tribal constitution.\\"Velarde Tiller, 122. An important value of sharing was integrated into the constitution, whereby the Apache Indians declare that the resources of the reservation are \\"held for the benefit of the entire tribe\\". Further, all land on the reservation is held by the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, one of only two reservations in the United States where land is not owned by individuals but by the tribal nation as a whole. Tribal members are individuals that are at least 3/8 Jicarilla Apache.Velarde Tiller, 143. The government is made up of the following branches:Warren, Tiller, 16-18. * executive, with a president and vice-president serving four-year terms * legislative, with eight members serving staggering four-year terms * judicial, tribal court and appellate court judges assigned by the president. Its capital is Dulce, which comprises over 95 percent of the reservation's population, near the extreme north end. Most tribal offices are located in Dulce. Reservation The Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, at , is located within two northern New Mexico counties: * Rio Arriba County * Sandoval County. from the Colorado border south to Cuba, New Mexico. The reservation sits along U.S. Route 64 and N.M. 537.King, PT232. The reservation has a land area of 1,364.046 sq mi (3,532.864 km¬≤) and had a population of 2,755 as of the 2000 census.Jicarilla Reservation, New Mexico . United States Census Bureau. Most of its people live in the tribal headquarters community of Dulce, near the reservation's northern end. The southern half of the reservation is open plains and the northern portion resides in the treed Rocky Mountains.Martin, 224. Mammals and birds migratory paths cross the reservation seasonally, including mountain lion, black bear, elk, Canada geese and turkey. Rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout are stocked in seven lakes on the reservation, but annual conditions such as low precipitation result in high pH-levels. From 1995 to 2000 the lake levels were severely low due to drought; As a result, most of the fish were killed off during those years. The reservation sits on the San Juan Basin, which is rich in fossil fuels. The basin is the largest producer of oil along the Rocky Mountains and the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States.Warren, Tiller, 7-8.Martin, 223-4. Culture The Jicarilla are traditionally matrilocal and are organized into matrilineal clans. They have incorporated some practices of their Pueblo neighbors into their own traditions. They are renowned for their fine basket making of distinctive diamond, cross or zig-zag designs or representations of deer, horses or other animals. They are known for their beadwork and keeping Apache fiddle-making alive.Pritzker, 14.Velarde Tiller, 51. In the 1970s approximately 70% of Jicarillas continued to hold to their traditional religious beliefs. As of 2000, about 70% of the tribe practice an organized religion, many of whom are Christians. Jicarilla is spoken by about one half of the tribal members, most by older men and women.Pritzker, 15. Ceremonial practices consist of: * Puberty feast, called \\"keesta\\" in Jicarilla, is a rite of passage ceremony for girls or young women.Velarde Tiller, 28-30 Annual events include: * Little Beaver Celebration with a pow-wow, rodeo, draft horse pull and a five-mile race mid-July. * Stone Lake Fiesta with ceremonial dances, rodeo and footraces each September 14 and 15. Economy The Jicarilla Apache Nation's economy is based upon mining, forestry, gaming, tourism, retail and agriculture,Warren, Tiller, 11. including: * Oil and gas wells, owned and operated by the tribe.Warren, Tiller, 10-11. * Timber. * Cattle and sheep ranching.Warren, Tiller, 12. * Reservation government employees, which include about 50% of tribal members. * Dulce business employees. * Traditional arts, including basketry and pottery. * Tribe-owned Apache Nugget Casino north of Cuba, New Mexico and the Best Western Jicarilla Inn and Casino in Dulce.\\"New Mexico Indian Casinos.\\" 500 Nations. (retrieved 23 Dec 2009) * The tribe also owns and operates radio station KCIE (90.5 FM) in Dulce, NM.\\"KCIE Facility Record\\". United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division. Although the mid twentieth century brought additional economic opportunities, high unemployment and a low standard of living prevails for tribal members. From the Tiller's Guide to Indian Country: Economic Profiles of American Reservations, 2005 edition:Velarde Tiller, 82. :Unemployment rate ‚Äì 14.2% :Labor force ‚Äì 1,1051 The Jicarilla people live in houses with a lifestyle similar to other Americans. The cost of food at local grocery stores is higher than found near larger U.S. cities. They have access to all modern conveniences and avail themselves according to their desires and financial ability. High unemployment and poverty level income rates have resulted in high crime rates, greatly contributed by a high incidence of [alcohol] abuse, averaging 1.7% of the United States Native American population and as high as 30% in some rural areas or reservations. Education Children attend a public school on the reservation. Until the 1960s few children graduated high school; the Bureau of Indian Affairs educational programs and the Chester A. Faris scholarship programs from oil and gas revenues since the 1960s provide opportunities for higher education. In the 1970s some tribal members obtained graduate degrees. Educational assistance offices were created by Apache tribes in the 1980s to help students navigate their educational career.

His first book, Your Erroneous Zones (1976), is one of the best-selling books of all time, with an estimated 35 million copies sold to date. Early life Dyer was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Melvin Lyle Dyer and Hazel Irene Vollick. He spent much of his first ten years in an orphanage on the east side of Detroit, after his father walked out on the family, leaving his mother to raise three small boys. After graduating from Denby High School, Dyer served in the United States Navy from 1958 to 1962. He received his Ed.D. degree in counseling from Wayne State University. His dissertation was titled Group Counseling Leadership Training in Counselor Education.  Career  Dyer, a Detroit native, worked as a high school guidance counselor there and as a professor of counseling psychology at St. John's University in New York City. He pursued an academic career, published in journals, and established a private therapy practice. His lectures at St. John's University, which focused on positive thinking and motivational speaking techniques, attracted many students. A literary agent persuaded Dyer to document his theories in his first book, called Your Erroneous Zones (1976). Dyer quit his teaching job and began a publicity tour of the United States, doggedly pursuing bookstore appearances and media interviews (\\"out of the back of his station wagon\\", according to Michael Korda, making the best-seller lists \\"before book publishers even noticed what was happening\\"). After Your Erroneous Zones dozens more books followed, many of them also best-sellers. Among them were Wishes Fulfilled, Excuses Begone and The Sky‚Äôs the Limit. The success of these books eventually led to national television talk show appearances including The Merv Griffin Show, The Tonight Show, and The Phil Donahue Show. Dyer proceeded to build on his success with lecture tours, a series of audiotapes, PBS programs, and regular publication of new books. Dyer's message resonated with many in the New Thought Movement and beyond. He often recounted anecdotes from his family life and repeatedly used his own life experience as an example. His self-made man success story was a part of his appeal. Dyer told readers to pursue self actualization, calling reliance on the self a guide to \\"religious\\" experience, and suggested that readers emulate Jesus Christ, whom he termed both an example of a self- actualized person and a \\"preacher of self-reliance\\". Dyer criticized societal focus on guilt, which he saw as an unhealthy immobilization in the present due to actions taken in the past. He encouraged readers to see how parents, institutions, and even they, themselves, had imposed guilt trips upon themselves. Although Dyer initially resisted the spiritual tag, by the 1990s he had altered his message to include more components of spirituality when he wrote the book Real Magic and discussed higher consciousness in the book Your Sacred Self.  Influences  Wayne Dyer stated Nisargadatta Maharaj to be his Teacher and cited the quotation, \\"Love says: 'I am everything'. Wisdom says: 'I am nothing' from a compilation of talks on Shiva Advaita (Nondualism) philosophy I Am That. He was influenced by Abraham Maslow's concept of self- actualization and by the teachings of Swami Muktananda, whom he considered to be his Master. In his book, Wishes Fulfilled; Mastering the Art of Manifesting, Dr. Dyer also credited Saint Francis of Assisi and the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu as foundational influences in his work.  The Books  Pulling Your Own Strings.(Copyright 1978) This was Dyers' 2nd work published as sole author. It developed the idea of habitual \\"belief systems\\" hampering our personal effectiveness. Chapter 7 \\"Never Place Loyalty to Institutions and Things Above Loyalty to Yourself\\" listed \\"Strategies for eliminating institutional victimisation\\".Pulling Your Own Strings, The Sky is the Limit (copyright 1980) was the 3rd work published by Dyer as sole author. Dyer introduces the concept of the \\"critical inch\\", that portion of life where the ultimate meaning of our life is considered. He is critical of the \\"hurry up\\" Western world society. In Chapter 8, \\"Cultivating a sense of Purpose\\" he recommends such strategies as \\"Do something you have never done before\\", \\"Make a point to talk to a stranger today\\", \\"Stop defending things as they have always been\\".The Sky is the Limit,  Criticism  Psychologist Albert Ellis wrote that Dyer's book Your Erroneous Zones was probably \\"the worst example\\" of plagiarism of Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy (RET). In a 1985 letter to Dyer, Ellis claimed that Dyer had participated in an Ellis workshop on RET before he published Your Erroneous Zones, in which Dyer appeared to understand RET very well. Ellis added that \\"300 or more people have voluntarily told me... that [the book] was clearly derived from RET.\\" Dyer never apologized nor expressed any sense of wrongdoing. Ellis admonished Dyer for unethically and unprofessionally failing to credit Ellis's work as the book's primary source, but he never took legal action and that is because in the final analysis, he actually felt overall gratitude for Dyer's work, writing: \\"Your Erroneous Zones is a good book, ... it has helped a great number of people, and ... it outlines the main principles of RET quite well,... with great simplicity and clarity.\\" In Your Erroneous Zones, Dyer makes reference to Albert Ellis in chapter seven. However, Dyer affirmatively stated that the entire premise of Your Erroneous Zones was principally derived from three years of audio tapes of the lectures that he gave while acting as a professor at St. John's University in New York on pages 150-155 of his memoir I Can See Clearly Now, which was published by Hay House Publishing in 2014, one year before Dyer's death. Thus, Ellis's criticism of Dyer was disputed and has not been proven. In 2010, writer Stephen Mitchell filed a lawsuit against Dyer and his publisher, Hay House, for copyright infringement for taking 200 lines, without permission, from his version of the Tao Te Ching for Dyer's books Living the Wisdom of the Tao and Change Your Thoughts ‚Äì Change Your Life.Belloni, Matt. \\"Self-help guru Wayne Dyer sued for stealing from Tao book\\" Hollywood Reporter, December 21, 2010 The suit was dismissed in 2011 after Dyer and Mitchell agreed to a settlement.\\"Stephen Mitchell v. Wayne Dyer et al\\" California Central District Court, Case No. 2:10-cv-03891, October 18, 2011 Personal life Dyer was married three times. With his first wife, Judy, he had a daughter. With his second wife, Susan Casselman, he had no children. With his third wife, Marcelene, he had five children, and two stepchildren from Marcelene's prior marriage. Wayne and Marcelene legally separated in 2001, after 20 years of marriage. After their separation period they reunited and remained married until his passing. =Credos= Death Dyer died from a heart attack, according to his publicist Lindsay McGinty, in Maui, Hawaii, on August 29, 2015, at age 75.

He is thought by some scholars to have lived during the time of Hadrian, based on authorship of a poem about the doctor Artemidorus Capito, a contemporary of Hadrian, being ascribed to him. Not all accept this identification; in the 1980s, first- century date was proposed for Straton and, more recently, a Neronian or Flavian period has been suggested. Diogenes La√´rtius, at the beginning of the 3rd century AD, mentions an epigrammist by the name of Straton, whom some believe was Straton of Sardis. Straton assembled the anthology of erotic and amorous epigrams called the ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒ± Œ†Œ±ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ∑ (Mousa Paidike, \\"The Boyish Muse\\" or Musa Puerilis). Around 900 AD, a Byzantine scholar named Constantine Cephalas compiled pieces of several Greek anthologies, including The Boyish Muse, to make a comprehensive collection of Greek epigrams. Since there is no other textual proof, we do not know if The Boyish Muse was taken whole, or if a selection was made from it, or if Cephalas maintained the order of the original anthology, or how much of it is original. Cephalas's collection was revised, divided into specialized anthologies, adapted for school use, and generally much copied. In 1301 AD, a scholar named Maximus Planudes put together a bowdlerized version of the Cephalan book, which became very popular in the Greek part of the ŒøiŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑. When the Ottomans conquered the remains of the Byzantine empire, many Greek scholars brought versions of Planudes' version with them into exile in Italy. The Greeks became teachers to Italian scholars. In 1494 they printed an edition of the Planudean book, the Florilegium Diversorum Epigrammatum, in Florence. Most of what we know of Straton's work comes instead from a manuscript copied around 980 AD, which preserved many of the poems from the earlier Cephalan anthology. This manuscript was discovered in the library of the Counts Palatine in Heidelberg in 1606 or 1607, by a young visiting scholar named Claudius Salmasius, now called the Palatine Anthology. There is no clear record of how it got there, but a visiting Italian scholar probably left it. About the middle of the 16th century, the Roman scholar and antiquarian Fulvio Orsini (1529‚Äì1600) had seen and mentioned such a manuscript, then in the possession of one Angelo Colloti. The newly discovered poems in the Palatine version were copied out by Salmasius, and he began to circulate clandestine manuscript copies as the Anthologia Inedita. His copy was later published: first in 1776 when Richard Fran√ßois Philippe Brunck included it in his Analecta; and then the full Palatine Anthology was published by F. Jacobs as the Anthologia Graeca (13 vols. 1794 - 1803; revised 1813 - 1817). The remains of Straton's The Boyish Muse became Book 12 in Jacob's critical Anthologia Graeca edition. Because of its taboo subject matter, until the mid-20th century Straton's work was generally left untranslated, translated only into Latin, published in censored forms, or translated only in private editions. These translations helped form the Greek core of influential homosexual poetry anthologies, such as Elisar von Kupffer's Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur (1899) and Edward Carpenter's Iolaus (1908). New translations of Straton's 'Book 12' were later published by poets such as Roger Peyrefitte and Salvatore Quasimodo. Straton's surviving anthology of poems was translated as part of W.R. Paton's translation of the entire Greek Anthology in the Loeb series in 1918, by Dennis Kratz in 1995, and by Daryl Hine. This last translation was published by Princeton University in 2001 as Puerilities, containing 258 surviving poems (omitting one, an obvious later forgery), translated by Daryl Hine, with Greek originals facing. The title is a pun on the one-time title of the work, the Musa Puerilis. Alessandria: Edizioni dell'Orso recently published in 2007 Lucia Floridi's Stratone di Sardi. Epigrammi. Testo critico, traduzione e commento, a book incorporating 105 epigrams into a single edition with commentary. An article by James Jope in the journal Mouseion (2005) compares the translations by Hine and Peyrefitte and discusses how the poems can be reshaped in a modern context.

The songs were written when she was aged 14‚Äì15, and reflect events in her life at the time. McKee had produced six of these in demo form in 2001, and they were broadcast on Seattle radio stations as well as the National Public Radio network. McKee had essentially completed the album in New York City with Bob Power as producer, when Reprise asked her to record \\"Somebody\\" with Rob Cavallo in California. Pleased with the more layered sound, she decided to re-record all but \\"January\\" and \\"I Hold Her\\". This delayed the album's release by a year. Production and release McKee first recorded her album in New York City with producer Bob Power across eight months. Then she was introduced to producer Rob Cavallo, who served as Reprise artists and repertoire man, and went to Los Angeles with him, first to record Trouble lead single \\"Somebody\\". The result was enough for them to re-record the whole album, taking a whole year in the process.Bonnie McKeeBonnie McKee Trouble interview and album review Reprise was unsure on how to promote McKee, with the singer herself admitting that \\"I was a teenage rebel rock star-but writing these heartfelt singer/songwriter songs. I was given a dress code because everyone thought I was 'too sexy.' No one knew what to do with me.\\"Singles Lady: Bonnie McKee Is Looking Out for Number One The label at first considering to showcase her in adult contemporary radio, based on her life history and style influenced by Fiona Apple. To determine how successful this would be, Reprise had a partnership with internet radio website LAUNCHcast, which would include \\"Somebody\\" into the adult contemporary playlists, as well as showcasing the song to other listeners. The result had \\"Somebody\\" being popular more with a younger audience than the adult females that the label expected, with the song eventually becoming the tenth most played on LAUNCHcast and McKee entering the 50 most searched terms on the website's owner Yahoo!. A new strategy was devised, trying to make McKee appeal to the teen pop demographic while showcasing a subversive attitude. This was illustrated by the album cover with McKee blowing a bubble gum, which the singer describes as \\"a bit of a play on the bubblegum pop thing, except it looks kind of like a mug shot.\\" The album title was an allusion to McKee's wild life: \\"'Trouble' was my middle name. It was such a hard time for me. Before I got the deal, I had a very difficult teen life as a drug addict and a runaway.\\" Along with \\"Somebody\\", which was featured on the soundtrack album of Win a Date With Tad Hamilton! (2004), title track \\"Trouble\\" was also a single. Reception Johnny Loftus of Allmusic gave a lukewarm review, saying \\"McKee's lyrics about adolescent empowerment and the ways of the heart aren't too different from what's already out there. But the songs still share the album's affected quality. It's as if the quirkier arrangements are intended as image builders, designed to add a spunky flair to the tousled, sassy McKee. Pop music doesn't require very much substance -- it's meant to be inviting, familiar, and easily accessible. But while Bonnie McKee's debut features an ultra-modern sound that's been proven successful, its homogenization ends up working against it. Pretty but ultimately empty, Trouble doesn't establish McKee as anything more than another hopeful\\" Tom Lanham of Paste magazine praised Trouble, which he considered \\"a great little folk-pop-punk album\\".Bonnie McKee Trouble No More MTV would later describe Trouble as \\"an astonishingly precocious (and criminally underrated) set of soulful pop-rock gems\\".Katy Perry‚Äôs ‚ÄòTeenage Dream‚Äô: Why Her Album Will Be Forever Young However, despite good reviews, the album disappointed commercially, moving fewer than 17,000 copies. McKee was subsequently dropped from Reprise Records. McKee spoke about the album being unsuccessful, saying \\"It was devastating when the album didn't happen,\\" she said. \\"I realized there are so many steps from getting a deal to having a hit...and I didn't get there. It was a huge letdown.\\" But reflecting on the album's underperformance considering her eventual success as a songwriter, McKee stated that \\"had Trouble done what I wanted it to, I may have been caught in Hot AC land forever, which is just not my style.\\"Writer Of The Week Bonnie McKee Track listing Credits *Bonnie McKee - vocals, keyboards *Paul Bushnell - bass on 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 *Rob Cavallo - acoustic guitar on 1, 10, 12; electric guitar on 2 *Greg Curtis - 3 (Hammond organ) on 4 *Dan Chase - Pro Tools on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12; programming on 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12 *Luis Conte - percussion on 1, 2 *Eric Ferguson - Pro Tools on 5, 6, 10 *Bashiri Johnson - percussion on 11 *Robbie Kondor - piano on 11 *Abe Laboriel Jr. - drums on 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 *Doug McKean - Pro Tools on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 *David McKelvy - harmonica on 2 *Tommy Morgan - harmonica on 5 *Jamie Muhoberac - keyboards on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 *Gary Novak - drums on 5, 6, 10 *Tim Pierce - guitars on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 *Doug Petty - piano on 8 *Bob Power - guitars, keyboards, bass, drums, percussion on 8, 11 *Buddy Schaub - horns on 6 *Pete Wallewski - horns on 6 *Patrick Warren - chamberlin on 4 *Emma Kummrow, Igor Szwec, Gloria Justen, Olga Konopelsky, Ghislaine Fleischmann, Gregory Tepperman - violin on 11 *Davis Barnett, Peter Nocella - viola on 11 *Jennie Lorenzo, James Cooper III - cello on 11 Production *\\"January\\" and \\"I Hold Her\\": **Producer - Bob Power **Recording - Lindsay Marcus, Bob Power, Blair Wells, David Winslow **Mixing - Dan Chase (\\"January\\"); Bob Power, Blair Wells (\\"I Hold Her\\") *All other tracks: **Producer - Rob Cavallo **Co-producer - Antonina Armato **Recording - Dan Chase, Doug McKean, Allen Sides **Mixing - Chris Lord-Alge, Tom Lord-Alge  Bonnie McKee: EP  Bonnie McKee is the debut extended play (EP) of American singer-songwriter Bonnie McKee released in December 2003 by Reprise Records.

It is sometimes referred to as the \\"vampire fish.\\" Description The sea lamprey has an eel-like body without paired fins. Its mouth is jawless, round and sucker-like, and as wide or wider than the head; sharp teeth are arranged in many consecutive circular rows. There are 7 branchial or gill-like openings behind the eye. Sea lampreys are olive or brown-yellow on the dorsal and lateral part of the body, with some black marblings, with lighter coloration on the belly. Adults can reach a length of up to and a body weight up to . =Etymology= The etymology of the genus name Petromyzon is from petro- \\"stone\\" and myzon \\"sucking\\"; marinus is Latin for \\"of the sea\\". Distribution and habitat The species is found in the northern and western Atlantic Ocean along the shores of Europe and North America, in the western Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and in the shores of the Great Lakes. They have been found at depths to 4000 m and tolerate temperatures of . They are native to the Connecticut River basin in the United States. The largest European populations of sea lampreys are located throughout the southwestern areas of Europe (north-central Portugal, north- northwest of Spain, and west‚Äìsouthwest of France). These countries also support the main fisheries of the species. Ecology Sea lampreys are anadromous; from their lake or sea habitats, they migrate up rivers to spawn. Females deposit a large number of eggs in nests made by males in the substrate of streams with moderately strong current. Spawning is followed by the death of the adults. Larvae burrow in the sand and silt bottom in quiet water downstream from spawning areas and filter-feed on plankton and detritus. After several years in freshwater habitats, the larvae undergo a metamorphosis that allows young, post-metamorphic lampreys to migrate to the sea or lakes, and start the adult hematophagous method of feeding. Some individuals start hematophagous feeding in the river before migrating to the sea, where sea lampreys prey on a wide variety of fish. The lamprey uses its suction cup-like mouth to attach itself to the skin of a fish and rasps away tissue with its sharp, probing tongue and keratinized teeth. A fluid produced in the lamprey's mouth, called lamphredin,Fig. 1 Effect of lamphredin from the buccal glands of lampreys in prevents the victim's blood from clotting. Victims typically die from excessive blood loss or infection. After one year of hematophagous feeding, lampreys return to the river to spawn and die, a year and a half after the completion of metamorphosis. Lampreys are considered a delicacy in some parts of Europe, and are seasonally available in France, Spain, and Portugal. They are served pickled in Finland.  Physiology  Two sea lamprey preying on a alt= Due to its lifecycle that switches between fresh and salt water, the sea lamprey is adapted to tolerate a wide range of salinities. Cell membranes on the surface of the gills are major contributors to ionoregulation. Changes in membrane composition influence the movement of different ions across the membrane, changing amounts of components to change the membranes' environment. As the larvae (called ammocoetes) move towards the oceans, the ratio between saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the gills shifts towards higher amounts of SFA, as they affect the fluidity of the membrane, and higher levels of SFA lead to a decrease in permeability compared to PUFA. Lamprey ammocoetes have a relatively narrow range of salinity tolerance, but become better able to withstand wider ranges of salinity concentrations as they reach later stages of life. Tight regulation of Na/K-ATPase and an overall decrease in expression of H-ATPase assists in regulating the lamprey's internal fluid and ion balance as it moves to areas of higher salinity. Lampreys also maintain acid-base homeostasis. When introduced to higher levels of acids, they are able to excrete excess acids at higher rates than most other saltwater fishes, and in much shorter times, with the majority of the transfer of ions occurring at the gill surface. Sea lampreys parasitize other fishes for their diet, including elasmobranchs such as sharks and rays, which have naturally high levels of urea in their blood. Urea is toxic to most fishes in high concentrations, and is usually excreted immediately. Lampreys are able to tolerate much higher concentrations than most other fish and excrete it at extremely high rates, obtained from ingested blood. Trimethylamine oxides present in ingested elasmobranch blood aid in counteracting the detrimental effects of high urea concentration in the lamprey's bloodstream as it feeds. Genetics The genome of Petromyzon marinus was sequenced in 2013. This sequencing effort revealed that the lamprey has unusual guanine-cytosine content and amino acid usage patterns compared to other vertebrates. The full sequence and annotation of the lamprey genome is available on the Ensembl genome browser. The lamprey genome may serve as a model for developmental biology and evolution studies involving transposition of repetitive sequences. The lamprey genome undergoes drastic rearrangements during early embryogenesis in which about 20% of the germline DNA from somatic tissues is shed. The genome is highly repetitive. About 35% of the current genome assembly is composed of repetitive elements with high sequence identity. Northern lampreys have the highest number of chromosomes (164‚Äì174) among vertebrates. Invasive species Sea lampreys are considered a pest in the Great Lakes region. The species is native to the inland Finger Lakes and Lake Champlain in New York and Vermont. Whether it is native to Lake Ontario, where it was first noticed in the 1830s, or whether it was introduced through the Erie Canal which opened in 1825 is not clear.Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Factsheet: Petromyzon marinus. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program (NAS). Retrieved on 2007-08-04. Improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919 are thought to have allowed its spread from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, and while it was never abundant in either lake, it soon spread to Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, where it decimated indigenous fish populations in the 1930s and 1940s. In its original habitats, the sea lamprey coevolved with its hosts, and those hosts evolved a measure of resistance to the sea lampreys. However, in the Great Lakes, the sea lamprey attacks native fish such as lake trout, lake whitefish, chub, and lake herring, which historically did not face sea lampreys. Elimination of these predators allowed the alewife, another invasive species, to explode in population, with adverse effects on many native fish species. The lake trout plays a vital role in the Lake Superior ecosystem. The lake trout has traditionally been considered an apex predator, which means that it has no predators. The sea lamprey is an aggressive predator by nature, which gives it a competitive advantage in a lake system where it has no predators and its prey lacks defenses against it. The sea lamprey played a large role in the destruction of the Lake Superior trout population. Lamprey introduction along with poor, unsustainable fishing practices caused the lake trout populations to decline drastically. The relationship between predators and prey in the Great Lakes' ecosystem then became unbalanced. Each individual sea lamprey has the potential of killing 40 pounds of fish through its 12‚Äì18 month feeding period. =Efforts at control= Mouth of a sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus Video of the breathing of sea lamprey. Gij√≥n Aquarium Control efforts, including electric current and chemical lampricides have met with varied success. The control programs are carried out under the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a joint Canada‚ÄìU.S. body, specifically by the agents of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Genetic researchers have mapped the sea lamprey's genome in the hope of finding out more about evolution; scientists trying to eliminate the Great Lakes problem are coordinating with these genetic scientists, hoping to find out more about its immune system and fitting it into its place in the phylogenetic tree. Researchers from Michigan State University have teamed up with others from the Universities of Minnesota, Guelph, and Wisconsin, and others in a research effort into newly synthesized pheromones. These are believed to have independent influences on the sea lamprey behavior. One group of pheromones serves a migratory function in that when they are made by larvae, they are thought to lure maturing adults into streams with suitable spawning habitat. Sex pheromones emitted from males are capable of luring females long distances to specific locations. These pheromones are both several different compounds thought to elicit different behaviors that collectively influence the lampreys to exhibit migratory or spawning behaviors. Scientists are trying to characterize the function of each pheromone, and each part of the molecules, to determine if they can be used in a targeted effort at environmentally friendly lamprey control. However, as of 2017, the most effective control measures still involve the application of (3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol), or TFM, a selective pesticide, into rivers. Another technique used in the prevention of lamprey population growth is the use of barriers in major reproduction streams of high value to the lamprey. The purpose of the barriers is to block their upstream migration to reduce reproduction. The issue with these barriers is that other aquatic species are also inhibited by this barrier. Fish that use tributaries are impeded from traveling upstream to spawn. To account for this, barriers have been altered and designed to allow the passage of most fish species, but still impede others. Restoration The intent of lamprey control programs is a safer habitat and a healthier population growth for vulnerable native fish species such as lake trout. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has taken a different path to this same goal by introducing sea lampreys to freshwater rivers and lakes of the Connecticut River watershed, and providing easier access around dams and other barriers for the lampreys to reach spawning sites high upstream. After preying on larger fish at sea, the adult lampreys migrate up the rivers to spawn, whereupon they quickly die of natural causes and decompose, thus providing a food source for the native freshwater fish species.

Retrieved 12 November 2009  Iron Ore Quarrying  The first iron ore quarry at Lamport was north of the village. It was close to the Draughton Road, on the west side of that road. It was connected to the railway by a standard gauge steam operated tramway. The junction was at the north end of the station. The ore was taken by the tramway and railway to blast furnaces at Finedon. This quarry operated from 1882 to 1890. Its position is marked by a crescent shaped depression in a field. The tramway's engine shed remains. Ore was quarried close to Hanging Houghton and Scaldwell from about 1912. By 1924 these quarries were working close to the junction of the main Northampton to Lamport road and the road to Scaldwell. The ore was at that time taken a short distance by narrow gauge (3 feet) tramway and then aerial ropeway to sidings on the railway between Brixworth and Hanging Houghton. This quarry to the north and east of the road junction operated until 1927 and again from 1936 to 1963. The narrow gauge tramway was replaced by a standard gauge line in 1942 which operated direct to the sidings without the need to tranship the ore onto the aerial ropeway. During this time the working face moved gradually northwards just to the east of the main road and Lamport Hall until the final workings were close to the village. In 1963 the final gullet was actually in the parish of Scaldwell, but it was very close to Lamport village to the west of the Lamport to Scaldwell road. Steam and later diesel quarrying machines were used and in 1942 an electric dragline was introduced. The tramways were worked by steam locomotives. The tramways and quarries have been landscaped and little is now visible except that the level of the fields quarried is lower than the roads.Tonks,pages 185 - 222 References External links Villages in Northamptonshire Daventry District Civil parishes in Northamptonshire ","title":"Lamport, Northamptonshire"},{"id":"1202744","title":"Second Lyons Ministry"},{"id":"1202745","title":"Third Lyons Ministry"},{"id":"1202746","title":"Fourth Lyons Ministry"},{"id":"1202747","text":"The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae which is the largest salmon and can grow up to a meter in length. It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into this ocean. Most populations of this fish species are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adult fish seasonally move upstream again to spawn. When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \\"landlocked\\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year -such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt. Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures and as such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has impacted the population in some areas, and as such the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world, and although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish it has also attracted criticism from environmentalists. Nomenclature The Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by Swedish zoologist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The name, Salmo salar, derives from the Latin salmo, meaning salmon, and salar, meaning leaper, according to M. Barton,Barton, M.: \\"Biology of Fishes.\\", pages 198‚Äì202 Thompson Brooks/Cole 2007 but more likely meaning \\"resident of salt water\\" . Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates salar as a kind of trout from its use in the Idylls of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species. Other names used for the Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, fiddler, sebago salmon, silver salmon, outside salmon and winnish. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon (or in North America). Description Atlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, Salmo. After two years at sea, the fish average in length and in weight. But specimens that spend four or more winters feeding at sea can be much larger. An Atlantic salmon netted in 1960 in Scotland, in the estuary of the river Hope, weighed , the heaviest recorded in all available literature. Another netted in 1925 in Norway measured in length, the longest Atlantic salmon on record.Buller F., The Domesday Book of Giant Salmon Volume 1 & 2. Constable (2007) & Constable (2010) The colouration of young Atlantic salmon does not resemble the adult stage. While they live in fresh water, they have blue and red spots. At maturity, they take on a silver-blue sheen. The easiest way of identifying them as an adult is by the black spots predominantly above the lateral line, though the caudal fin is usually unspotted. When they reproduce, males take on a slight green or red colouration. The salmon has a fusiform body, and well-developed teeth. All fins, except the adipose fin, are bordered with black. Distribution and habitat The natural breeding grounds of Atlantic salmon are rivers in Europe and the northeastern coast of North America. In Europe, Atlantic salmon are still found as far south as Spain, and as far north as Russia. Because of sport-fishing, some of the species' southern populations in northern Spain are growing smaller. The species distribution is easily influenced by changes in freshwater habitat and climate. Atlantic salmon are a cold-water fish species and are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature. The Housatonic River, and its Naugatuck River tributary, hosted the southernmost Atlantic salmon spawning runs in the United States. However, there is a 1609 account by Henry Hudson that Atlantic salmon once ran up the Hudson River. In addition, fish scale evidence dating to 10,000 years BP places Atlantic salmon in a coastal New Jersey pond. In two publications from 1988 and 1996, Carlson questioned the notion that Atlantic salmon were prehistorically abundant in New England, when the climate was warmer as it is now. Her argument was furthermore based on a paucity of bone data in archaeological sites relative to other fish species, and that historical claims may have been exaggerated. This argument was later challenged in another paper which claimed that lack of archaeological bone fragments could be explained by salmon bones being rare at sites that still have large salmon runs and that salmonid bones in general are poorly recovered relative to other fish species. Atlantic salmon populations were significantly reduced in the United States following European settlement. The fur trade, timber harvesting, dams and mills and agriculture degraded freshwater habitats and lowered the carrying capacity of most North American streams. Beaver populations were trapped to near-extinction by 1800, and log drives and clear- cutting further exacerbated stream erosion and habitat loss. As timber and fur gave way to agriculture, freshwater Atlantic salmon habitat was further compromised. According to historian D.W. Dunfield (1985) \\"over half of the historical Atlantic salmon runs had been lost in North America by 1850\\". In the Gulf Region of Nova Scotia it was reported that 31 of the 33 Atlantic salmon streams were blocked off by lumber dams, leading to the extirpation of early-run fish in many watersheds. The inshore Atlantic salmon fishery became a major export of the New World, with major fishing operations establishing along the shores of major river systems. The southernmost populations were the first to disappear. Young salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. ), they smoltify, changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to osmotic differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line. When they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometres at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents. It is possible they find their natal river by smell, although this is not confirmed; only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river. The range of an individual Atlantic salmon can thus be the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path. Wild salmon disappeared from many rivers during the twentieth century due to overfishing and habitat change. Ecology =Diet= Young salmon begin a feeding response within a few days. After the yolk sac is absorbed by the body, they begin to hunt. Juveniles start with tiny invertebrates, but as they mature, they may occasionally eat small fish. During this time, they hunt both in the substrate and in the current. Some have been known to eat salmon eggs. The most commonly eaten foods include caddisflies, blackflies, mayflies, and stoneflies. As adults, the salmon prefer capelin as their meal of choice. Capelin are elongated silvery fish that grow up to long. =Behavior= Fry and parr have been said to be territorial, but evidence showing them to guard territories is inconclusive. While they may occasionally be aggressive towards each other, the social hierarchy is still unclear. Many have been found to school, especially when leaving the estuary. Adult Atlantic salmon are considered much more aggressive than other salmon, and are more likely to attack other fish than others. =Life stages= Most Atlantic salmon follow an anadromous fish migration pattern, in that they undergo their greatest feeding and growth in saltwater; however, adults return to spawn in native freshwater streams where the eggs hatch and juveniles grow through several distinct stages. Atlantic salmon do not require saltwater. Numerous examples of fully freshwater (i.e., \\"landlocked\\") populations of the species exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including a now extinct population in Lake Ontario, which have been shown in recent studies to have spent their entire life cycle in watershed of the lake.\\"Study sheds light on extinct Lake Ontario salmon\\". Toronto Star, 9 November 2016, page GT1. In North America, the landlocked strains are frequently known as ouananiche. Freshwater phase The freshwater phases of Atlantic salmon vary between two and eight years, according to river location. While the young in southern rivers, such as those to the English Channel, are only one year old when they leave, those further north, such as in Scottish rivers, can be over four years old, and in Ungava Bay, northern Quebec, smolts as old as eight years have been encountered. The first phase is the alevin stage, when the fish stay in the breeding ground and use the remaining nutrients in their yolk sacs. During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the fry stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into parr, in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean. During these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to predation. Nearly 40% are eaten by trout alone. Other predators include other fish and birds. Egg and juvenile survival is dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change. Saltwater phases When parr develop into smolt, they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows acclimation to the changing salinity. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an ebb tide. Having left their natal streams, they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West Greenland. During this time, they face predation from humans, seals, Greenland sharks, skate, cod, and halibut. Some dolphins have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them. Once large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the grilse phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor ‚Äì the exact chemical signature of that stream ‚Äì may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250 g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. Grey and common seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon. Survivability to this stage has been estimated at between 14 and 53%.

The species constructs a nest or \\"redd\\" in the gravel bed of a stream. The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and milt (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression. Unlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning (semelparous), the Atlantic salmon is iteroparous, which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice. Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm. Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a 'bet hedging' strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn. Hybridization When in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with brown trout (Salmo trutta).Youngson, A. F., Webb, J. H., Thompson, C. E., and Knox, D. 1993.

Source Norwegian Institute of Water Research, 7462, Trondheim, Norway Hybrids between Atlantic salmon and brown trout were detected in two of four watersheds studied in northern Spain. The proportions of hybrids in samples of salmon ranged from 0 to 7-7% but these proportions were not significantly homogeneous among locations, resulting in a mean hybridization rate of 2-3%. This is the highest rate of natural hybridization so far reported and is significantly greater than rates observed elsewhere in Europe.Natural hybridization between Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in northern Spain by Carlos Garcia de Leaniz =Beaver impact= The decline in anadromous salmonid species over the last two to three centuries is correlated with the decline in the North American beaver and European beaver, although some fish and game departments continue to advocate removal of beaver dams as potential barriers to spawning runs. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile Salmo salar upstream from the dams suggests the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows. In a 2003 study, Atlantic salmon and sea-run brown trout spawning in the Numedalsl√•gen River and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern Norway was unhindered by beavers. In a restored, third-order stream in northern Nova Scotia, beaver dams generally posed no barrier to Atlantic salmon migration except in the smallest upstream reaches in years of low flow where pools were not deep enough to enable the fish to leap the dam or without a column of water over-topping the dam for the fish to swim up. The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important in streams of northerly latitudes without deep pools where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams. In addition, the up to eight-year-long residence time of juveniles in freshwater may make beaver-created permanent summer pools a crucial success factor for Atlantic salmon populations. In fact, two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond. Relationship to humans Atlantic salmon still remains a popular fish for human consumption. It is commonly sold fresh, canned, or frozen. Seine fishing for salmon ‚Äì Wenzel Hollar, 1607‚Äì1677 European fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in rivers using hand-made nets for many centuries.Jenkins, J. Geraint (1974). Nets and Coracles, p. 68. London, David and Charles. Wood and stone weirs along streams and ponds were used for millennia to harvest salmon in the rivers of Maine and New England, and gillnetting was also used in early colonial America.Netboy, Anthony (1973) The Salmon: Their Fight for Survival, pp. 181‚Äì182. Boston, Houghton Mifflin. In its natal streams, Atlantic salmon are considered prized recreational fish, pursued by fly anglers during its annual runs. At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery. The wild Atlantic salmon fishery is commercially residual; wild fish make up only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in world fish markets. The rest are from aquaculture farms, predominantly in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia. The origin of the word for \\"salmon\\" was one of the arguments about the location of the origin of the Indo-European languages. =Aquaculture= Atlantic salmon marine cages in the Faroe Islands Adult male and female fish are anaesthetised; their eggs and sperm are \\"stripped\\" after the fish are cleaned and cloth dried. Sperm and eggs are mixed, washed, and placed into freshwater. Adults recover in flowing, clean, well-aerated water. Some researchers have even studied cryopreservation of their eggs. Fry are generally reared in large freshwater tanks for 12 to 20 months. Once the fish have reached the smolt phase, they are taken out to sea, where they are held for up to two years. During this time, the fish grow and mature in large cages off the coasts of Canada, the US, or parts of Europe. Generally, cages are made of two nets. Inner nets, which wrap around the cages, hold the salmon. Outer nets, which are held by floats, keep predators out. Controversy Farmed Atlantic salmon are known to occasionally escape from cages and enter the habitat of wild populations. Interbreeding between escaped farm fish and wild fish decreases genetic diversity and introduces \\"the potential to genetically alter native populations, reduce local adaptation and negatively affect population viability and character\\". A 2018 study discovered extensive cross-breeding of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in the Northwest Atlantic, showing that 27.1% of fish in 17 out of 18 rivers examined are artificially stocked or hybrids. On the west coast of the United States and Canada, aquaculturists are generally under scrutiny to ensure that non-native Atlantic salmon cannot escape from their open-net pens, however occasional incidents of escape have been documented. During one incident in 2017, for example, up to 300,000 potentially invasive Atlantic salmon escaped a farm among the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound, Washington; Washington banned salmon farming in 2019, to be phased out by 2025. Despite being the source of considerable controversy, the likelihood of escaped Atlantic salmon establishing an invasive presence in the Pacific Northwest is considered minimal, largely because a number of 20th century efforts aimed at deliberately introducing them to the region were ultimately unsuccessful. From 1905 until 1935, for example, in excess of 8.6 million Atlantic salmon of various life stages (predominantly advanced fry) were intentionally introduced to more than 60 individual British Columbia lakes and streams. Historical records indicate, in a few instances, mature sea-run Atlantic salmon were captured in the Cowichan River; however, a self-sustaining population never materialized. Similarly unsuccessful results were realized after deliberate attempts at introduction by Washington as late as the 1980s. Consequently, environmental assessments by the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the BC Environmental Assessment Office have concluded the potential risk of Atlantic salmon colonization in the Pacific Northwest is low. Farming of Atlantic salmon in open cages at sea has been linked to the decline in wild stocks. This decline can be attributed to the passing of parasites from farmed to wild salmon. Conservation The IUCN rates this as a common species with a conservation status of \\"least concern\\". Human activities have however impacted salmon populations across parts of its range. The major threats are from overfishing and habitat change. Salmon decline in Lake Ontario goes back to the 18th‚Äì19th centuries, due to logging and soil erosion, as well as dam and mill construction. By 1896, the species was declared extirpated from the lake.Harb, M. \\"Upstream Battle\\", Canadian Geographic Magazine, June 2008, p. 24 In the 1950s, salmon from rivers in the United States and Canada, as well as from Europe, were discovered to gather in the sea around Greenland and the Faroe Islands. A commercial fishing industry was established, taking salmon using drift nets. After an initial series of record annual catches, the numbers crashed; between 1979 and 1990, catches fell from four million to 700,000. Pabos River of Quebec as recreation. Beginning around 1990, the rates of Atlantic salmon mortality at sea more than doubled in the western Atlantic. Rivers of the coast of Maine, southern New Brunswick and much of mainland Nova Scotia saw runs drop precipitously, and even disappear. An international effort to study the increased mortality rate was organized by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization. In 2000 the numbers of Atlantic salmon dropped to very low levels in Newfoundland, Canada. In 2007 at least one sport fishing organisation from Iceland and Scandinavia blamed less fish caught by recreational anglers on overfishing at sea, and thus created the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy commercial quotas in the Atlantic from commercial fishermen in an effort to preserve wild Salmo salar stocks. Possibly because of improvements in ocean feeding grounds, returns in 2008 were very positive. On the Penobscot River in Maine, returns were about 940 in 2007, and by mid-July 2008, the return was 1,938. Similar stories were reported in rivers from Newfoundland to Quebec. In 2011, more than 3,100 salmon returned to the Penobscot, the most since 1986, and nearly 200 ascended the Narraguagus River, up from the low two digits just a decade before. Recreational fishing of Atlantic salmon is now authorized in much of the USA and Canada where it occurs in large numbers, but this is subject to regulations in many states or provinces which are designed to maintain the continuity of the species. Strict catch limits, catch and release practices and forced fly fishing are examples of those regulations. =Restoration efforts= A fishmonger in Lysekil, Sweden shows a Norwegian salmon. Around the North Atlantic, efforts to restore salmon to their native habitats are underway, with slow progress. Habitat restoration and protection are key to this process, but issues of excessive harvest and competition with farmed and escaped salmon are also primary considerations. In the Great Lakes, Atlantic salmon have been introduced successfully, but the percentage of salmon reproducing naturally is very low. Most are stocked annually. Atlantic salmon were native to Lake Ontario, but were extirpated by habitat loss and overfishing in the late 19th century. The state of New York has since stocked its adjoining rivers and tributaries, and in many cases does not allow active fishing. In New England, many efforts are underway to restore salmon to the region by knocking down obsolete dams and updating others with fish ladders and other techniques that have proven effective in the West with Pacific salmon. There is some success thus far, with populations growing in the Penobscot and Connecticut Rivers. Lake Champlain now has Atlantic salmon. In Ontario, the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program was started in 2006, and is one of the largest freshwater conservation programs in North America. It has stocked Lake Ontario with over 700,000 young Atlantic salmon. Recent documented successes in the reintroduction of Atlantic salmon include the following: * In October 2007, salmon were video-recorded running in Toronto's Humber River by the Old Mill. * A migrating salmon was observed in Ontario's Credit River in November 2007. * As of 2013, there has been some success in establishing Atlantic salmon in Fish Creek, a tributary of Oneida Lake in central New York. * In November 2015, salmon nests were observed in Connecticut in the Farmington River, a tributary of the Connecticut River where Atlantic salmon had not been observed spawning since \\"probably the Revolutionary War\\". A 45-year, $25 million federal government effort to restore wild Atlantic salmon to the Connecticut River watershed was discontinued in 2012, but now appears to have been successful. =NASCO= The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization is an international council made up of Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and the United States, with its headquarters in Edinburgh. It was established in 1983 to help protect Atlantic salmon stocks, through the cooperation between nations. They work to restore habitat and promote conservation of the salmon. Legislation =England and Wales= Edward I instituted a penalty for collecting salmon during certain times of the year. His son Edward II continued, regulating the construction of weirs. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the justices of the peace. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced. Based on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the Home Office's control, but it was later transferred to the Board of Trade, and then later to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge 'duties' to catch other freshwater fish, including trout. Despite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards. In 1974, the 32 boards were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the Northumbrian, Welsh, northwest and southwest RWA's had considerable salmon populations, all ten also cared for trout and freshwater eels. The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975. Among other things, it regulated fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon's migratory paths. =Scotland= Salmon was greatly valued in medieval Scotland, and various fishing methods, including the use of weirs, cruives, and nets, were used to catch the fish. Fishing for salmon was heavily regulated in order to conserve the resource.Kate Buchanan, \\"Wheeles and Creels: The Physical Representation of the Right to Milling and Fishing in Sixteenth-Century Angus, Scotland\\" in Medieval and Early Modern Representations of Authority in Scotland and the British Isles (eds. Kate Buchanan & Lucinda H.S. Dean with Michael Penman: Routledge, 2016), pp. 59‚Äì60. In 1318, King Robert I enacted legislation setting a minimum size for cruives, \\"so that no fry of fish are impeded from ascending and descending...\\" Laws on catching fish upon royal lands were frequently updated, demonstrating their importance. Because the fish were held in such high regard, poachers were severely punished; a person twice convicted of poaching salmon on a royal estate could be sentenced to death.Jim Mac Laughlin,Troubled Waters: A Social and Cultural History of Ireland's Sea Fisheries (Four Courts Press, 2010), p. 77. The export of salmon was economically important in Aberdeen; beginning in the 15th century, the fish could be preserved through salting and barreling, allowing it to be exported abroad, including as far away as the Baltic. The volume of the early Scottish salmon trade is impossible to determine, since surviving custom records date only from the 1420 onward, and since Aberdeen burgesses enjoyed an exemption on salmon customs until the 1530s.Katie Stevenson, Power and Propaganda: Scotland, 1306‚Äì1488 (Edinburgh University Press, 2014). During the 15th century, many laws were passed; many regulated fishing times, and worked to ensure smolts could safely pass downstream. James III even closed a meal mill because of its history of killing fish attracted to the wheel. More recent legislation has established commissioners who manage districts. Furthermore, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act in 1951 required the Secretary of State be given data about the catches of salmon and trout to help establish catch limits. =United States= Several populations of Atlantic salmon are in serious decline, and are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Currently, runs of 11 rivers in Maine are on the list ‚Äì Kennebec, Androscoggin, Penobscot, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Cove Brook, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Machias, East Machias and Dennys. The Penobscot River is the \\"anchor river\\" for Atlantic salmon populations in the US. Returning fish in 2008 were around 2,000, more than double the 2007 return of 940. Section 9 of the ESA makes it illegal to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife. The definition of \\"take\\" is to \\"harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct\\".(16 U.S.C. 1532(19)) http://www.epa.gov/EPA- SPECIES/1998/May/Day-01/e11668.htm =Canada= The federal government has prime responsibility for protecting the Atlantic salmon, but over the last generation, effort has continued to shift management as much as possible to provincial authorities through memoranda of understanding, for example. A new Atlantic salmon policy is in the works, and in the past three years, the government has attempted to pass a new version of the century-old Fisheries Act through Parliament. Federal legislation regarding at-risk populations is weak. Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon runs were declared endangered in 2000. As of 2008, no recovery plan is in place. Nongovernmental organizations, such as the Atlantic Salmon Federation,http://www.asf.ca/ constantly demand for improvements in management, and for initiatives to be considered. For example, the ASF and the Nova Scotia Salmon Association desire the use of technology for mitigation of acid rain-affected rivers such as used in Norway is in 54 Nova Scotia rivers and managed to raise the funds to get a project in place in one river. In Quebec, the daily catch limit for Atlantic salmon is dependent on the individual river. Some rivers are strictly catch and release with a limit of 3 released fish. Each catch must be declared. Some rivers allow you to keep between 1 or 2 grilse (30 cm to 63 cm), while some of the more prolific rivers (mainly on the north coast) will allow you to keep 1 salmon over 63 cm. The annual catch limit is 4 Atlantic salmon of small size and only 1 of those may be bigger than 63 cm. In Lake Ontario, the historic populations of Atlantic salmon became extinct, and cross-national efforts have been under way to reintroduce the species, with some areas already having restocked naturally reproducing populations.

Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer (1798‚Äì1857) built the church of St John as a chapel of ease and a memorial to his first wife, the former Elizabeth Georgina Poyntz whom he had married in 1830. The church consisted of a chancel, nave and tower with a tall spire and was built in the local brown ironstone of the area. In the 19th century and early in the 20th services were held on a regular basis. The Earl had provided the church for the convenience of villagers from Little Brington and Nobottle, who found it difficult to attend St. Mary's in Great Brington (almost 1 mile distant). St John's could seat approximately 150 people and was licensed for baptisms and marriages; funerals and burials were held in Great Brington St Mary's. By the 1940s, the church had fallen into a state of disrepair, mainly because of a leaking roof. The main body of the church was demolished after the war in 1947. At the request of the Air Ministry, however, the distinctive tower with its octagonal spire was spared. It had become a landmark to navigators and likely serves the same purpose today.

Lower Catesby is beside the nascent River Leam, which rises about to the south in the parish of Hellidon. The Jurassic Way long-distance footpath passes through Lower Catesby. The population of the hamlet is included in the civil parish of Hellidon. Archaeology Roman coins of the Empress Faustina I (early 2nd century) and Emperor Maximian (late 3rd century) are said to have been found in Catesby Park near Lower Catesby before 1720. Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records a manor of four hides at Catesby, and that one Sasfrid held it of William Peveral. The same four hides held of William Peverel (sic) is recorded again in the 12th century. In about 1175 it was held by Sasfrid's grandson Robert de Esseby (i.e. \\"Ashby\\", referring to Robert's caput at Canons Ashby). Priory Robert de Esseby founded a priory of Cistercian nuns at Lower Catesby in about 1175. In the 1230s Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, committed his sisters Margaret and Alice to be nuns at the priory. Edmund was canonized in 1247, Margaret was elected prioress in 1245 and she served until her death in 1257. In 1267 William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick died and his heart was buried at Catesby Priory. In 1535 Parliament passed the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535. Thomas Cromwell's commissioners inspected the priory in September 1535 and May 1536, and reported that the prioress and her nine nuns were of good faith and blameless character. Henry VIII nonetheless ordered the commissioners to suppress the priory, which they did before the end of 1536. The last prioress was pensioned off, her nuns and dependents were evicted, all the priory's furnishings were seized, its hand-bells were scrapped, and the lead from the roofs of the priory church and buildings was taken and sold for scrap. Catesby House and parish church The present Catesby House, built in 1863 In 1537 the Crown sold the remains of the priory to John Onley, who had at least part of the building turned into his family mansion. Early in the 17th century it passed from the Onley family to a family called Parkhurst. Also in the 17th century a church was built or rebuilt in Lower Catesby. An engraving made in about 1720 and drawings made in 1844 suggest a 16th-century house arranged around a central courtyard and a symmetrical west front rebuilt about 1700, with a very formal garden around the house and extending to the east of it. The central courtyard could have been derived from the priory courtyard. In Catesby churchyard is the tomb of John Parkhurst (1701‚Äì65). One of his sons was the Revd. John Parkhurst (1728‚Äì97), who was a biblical lexicographer. In 1861 the 17th-century church was demolished and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of SS Edmund and Mary, which was designed by Gillet of Leicester and completed in 1862. The present church includes a Decorated Gothic sedilia and piscina dating from about 1300, almost certainly carved for the priory church when it was rebuilt in about 1301. The present church also includes Jacobean woodwork from its 17th-century predecessor: a communion rail with barley-twist balusters, and a pulpit and tester. In 1863 the Catesby House was demolished and a new one was built above lower Catesby, about half-way up the hill to Upper Catesby. The new Catesby House is Jacobethan and incorporates items from previous buildings at Lower Catesby: 16th-century linenfold panelling said to come from the priory, and 17th-century panelling, doorcases and a stair with barley-sugar balusters, all from the old Catesby House. In 1894 Catesby House was enlarged and a vestry and west porch were added to the church. A long, rectangular formal pond survives from the gardens of the old Catesby House. There are earthworks, many of them rectilinear, indicating house or priory walls and further formal ponds. It is not entirely clear which walls are from the house and which are from the priory. Village Houses at Lower Catesby The hamlet of Lower Catesby is a shrunken village. The modern hamlet has only a handful of houses, all of which are 17th-century or later. It is surrounded by numerous earthen features showing where cottages and the main village street had been. Most of the fields around the former village still have clear ridge and furrow marks from the ploughing of the medieval arable farming with an open field system divided into narrow strips. Just north of the church is a row of four early 17th-century cottages. Pevsner and Cherry commented that the row \\"looks as if it were built as almshouses\\". Stone House in Upper Catesby, about east of the ruins of Upper Catesby church, is early 18th-century. Its porch incorporates a 13th-century Early English Gothic arch said to be from the priory.

Individual ministerial responsibility is not the same as cabinet collective responsibility, which states members of the cabinet must approve publicly of its collective decisions or resign. This means that a motion for a vote of \\"no confidence\\" is not in order should the actions of an organ of government fail in the proper discharge of their responsibilities. Where there is ministerial responsibility, the accountable minister is expected to take the blame and ultimately resign, but the majority or coalition within parliament of which the minister is part, is not held to be answerable for that minister's failure. This means that if waste, corruption, or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is responsible even if the minister had no knowledge of the actions. A minister is ultimately responsible for all actions by a ministry because, even without knowledge of an infraction by subordinates, the minister approved the hiring and continued employment of those civil servants. If misdeeds are found to have occurred in a ministry, the minister is expected to resign. It is also possible for a minister to face criminal charges for malfeasance under their watch. The principle is considered essential, as it is seen to guarantee that an elected official is answerable for every single government decision. It is also important to motivate ministers to closely scrutinize the activities within their departments. One rule coming from this principle is that each cabinet member answers for their own ministry in parliament's question time. The reverse of ministerial responsibility is that civil servants are not supposed to take credit for the successes of their department, allowing the government to claim them. In recent years some commentators have argued the notion of ministerial responsibility has been eroded in many Commonwealth countries. As the doctrine is a constitutional convention, there is no formal mechanism for enforcing the rule. Today ministers frequently use ignorance of misbehaviour as an argument for lack of culpability, or argue that actions were instigated by a previous minister, or even a previous government. While opposition parties rarely accept this argument, the electorate is often more accepting. In most other Commonwealth countries such cases are today hardly ever brought to trial. Australia The doctrine of ministerial responsibility in the Australian Government was inherited in its adoption of the Westminster system. Commonwealth ministers are obliged to report failings of departments under their control to the Parliament, and to actively seek solutions to problems in their jurisdiction. A minister who fails to properly do either of these is expected to resign. However, in practice, resignations rarely occur for a number of reasons. Although public opinion remains strongly in favour of ministers resigning regardless of their personal involvement in departmental failings, the need for such actions has been eroded by the introduction of alternative mechanisms ensuring executive accountability, such as freedom of information laws and more powerful parliamentary committees. Canada For organizational purposes there are Cabinet Ministers who are responsible for all activity within their department. In Canada ministerial responsibility has been reduced as it has become increasingly common for top level civil servants to be called before Parliament, bypassing the minister. New Zealand In New Zealand, ministerial responsibility has tended to follow British practice. Ministers have resigned in cases of personal misconduct, but more rarely in cases of maladministration. Ministers have refused to resign in some cases where they have been asked to account for departmental errors. The most famous case was Bob Semple, who refused to resign in 1943 over engineering failures in the construction of a railway tunnel. He was quoted as saying \\"I am responsible, but not to blame.\\" Subsequent notable incidents have included the refusal of a minister's resignation in the 1980s over compromised security of Budget documents, a minister resigning his portfolio (but not leaving Cabinet) over the 1995 Cave Creek disaster, and the resignation of a minister in 2011 for appearing to interfere in the administration of an ACC case. United Kingdom It is currently unclear what individual action a minister ought to take when a civil servant within his department is guilty of maladministration. The formulation of some guidelines took place during the Crichel Down Affair in 1954 in which the Minister of Agriculture, Thomas Dugdale, resigned, despite an inquiry suggesting that all mistakes were made within his department without his knowledge and in some cases due to deliberate deceit by civil servants. Later details suggested that he resigned because he supported the civil servants' actions and because he disagreed with the government accepting the inquiry's conclusions. The government announced that ministers must defend civil servants who act properly and in accordance with policies set out by the minister. Furthermore, it was stated that \\"where an official makes a mistake or causes some delay, but not on an important issue of policy and not where a claim to individual rights is seriously involved, the Minister acknowledges the mistake and he accepts the responsibility although he is not personally involved.\\" In 1982, Lord Carrington (then Foreign Secretary) and two other Foreign Office ministers resigned shortly after the invasion of the Falkland Islands. Later official reviews stated that, although there had been misjudgments within the Foreign Office, no responsibility attached to any individual within the government. However, in 1983, when 38 IRA prisoners broke out of the Maze prison, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Prior, did not resign, explaining that the break-out was not caused by any policy initiative originating from him. This latter position has become the norm in British politics. An exception might be Estelle Morris, who resigned as Secretary of State for Education in 2002, saying she had not done well enough after a scandal over A-level marking. Some recent resignations due to personal errors of judgment or impropriety include the resignation of Ron Davies, the Secretary of State for Wales, for sexual misconduct in 1998, and the resignation of Peter Mandelson, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, for failing to disclose a substantial loan by a Cabinet colleague in 1999. An argument put forward during the Scott Inquiry into the Arms-to-Iraq affair in the 1980s was a distinction between political responsibility and political accountability.

The title comes from the first two lines of William Shakespeare's Richard III: \\"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun [or son] of York\\". Plot summary The story concerns mainly Ethan Allen Hawley, a former member of Long Island's aristocratic class. Ethan's late father lost the family fortune, and thus Ethan works as a grocery store clerk. His wife Mary and their children resent their mediocre social and economic status, and do not value the honesty and integrity that Ethan struggles to maintain amidst a corrupt society. These external factors and his own psychological turmoil lead Ethan to try to overcome his inherent integrity in order to reclaim his former status and wealth. Ethan's decision to gain wealth and power is influenced by criticisms and advice from people he knows. His acquaintance Margie urges him to accept bribes; the bank manager (whose ancestors Ethan blames for his family's misfortunes) urges him to be more ruthless. Ethan's friend Joey, a bank teller, even gives Ethan a lesson on how to rob a bank and get away with it. On discovering that the current store owner, Italian immigrant Alfio Marullo, may be an illegal immigrant, Ethan makes an anonymous tip to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. After Marullo is taken into custody, he transfers ownership of the store to Ethan through the actions of the very government agent that caught him. Marullo gives Ethan the store because he believes Ethan is honest and deserving. Ethan also considers, plans, and mentally rehearses a bank robbery, failing to perform it only because of external circumstances. Eventually, he manages to become powerful in the town by taking possession of a strip of land needed by local businessmen to build an airport; he gets the land from Danny Taylor, the town drunkard and Ethan's childhood best friend, by a will made by Danny and slipped under the door of the store. The will was drawn without any spoken agreement some time after Ethan gave Danny money for the purpose of sending Danny to receive treatment for alcoholism. Danny assures him that drunks are liars and that he will just drink the money away, and this is indeed confirmed when Danny is found dead with empty bottles of whiskey and sleeping pills. In this manner, Ethan becomes able to control the covert dealings of the corrupt town businessmen and politicians, but he is confident that he will not be corrupted. He considers that while he had to kill enemy soldiers in the war, he was never a murderer thereafter. Ethan learns that his son won honorable mention in a nationwide essay contest by plagiarizing classic American authors and orators, but when Ethan confronts him, the son denies having any guilty feelings, maintaining that everyone cheats and lies. Perhaps after seeing his own moral decay in his son's actions, and experiencing the guilt of Marullo's deportation and the death of Danny, Ethan resolves to commit suicide. His daughter, intuitively understanding his intent, slips a family talisman into his pocket during a long embrace. When Ethan decides to commit the act, he reaches into his pocket to find razorblades and instead finds the talisman. As the tide comes into the alcove in which he has sequestered himself, he struggles to get out in order to return the talisman to his daughter. Main characters *Ethan Allen Hawley ‚Äì a grocery clerk (the story's protagonist) *Mary Hawley ‚Äì Ethan's wife *Margie Young-Hunt ‚Äì seductress and Mary's friend *Mr. Baker ‚Äì banker *Alfio Marullo ‚Äì Italian immigrant owner of grocery store Literary significance and criticism Edward Weeks of the Atlantic Monthly immediately reviewed the book as a Steinbeck classic: \\"His dialogue is full of life, the entrapment of Ethan is ingenious, and the morality in this novel marks Mr. Steinbeck's return to the mood and the concern with which he wrote The Grapes of Wrath\\". The Swedish Academy agreed and awarded Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. The presentation speech by Secretary Anders √ñsterling remarked specifically on five books from 1935 to 1939 and continued thus: > In this brief presentation it is not possible to dwell at any length on > individual works which Steinbeck later produced. If at times the critics > have seemed to note certain signs of flagging powers, of repetitions that > might point to a decrease in vitality, Steinbeck belied their fears most > emphatically with The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), a novel published > last year. Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of > Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth > with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad. Saul Bellow also lauded the book, saying: \\"John Steinbeck returns to the high standards of The Grapes of Wrath and to the social themes that made his early work so impressive, and so powerful.\\" However, many reviewers in America were disappointed. A few years later Peter Lisca called Winter \\"undeniable evidence of the aesthetic and philosophical failure of the [Steinbeck's] later fiction\\". In letters to friends before and after its publication, Steinbeck stated that he wrote the novel to address the moral degeneration of American culture during the 1950s and 1960s. American criticism of his moralism started to change during the 1970s after the Watergate scandal; here is how Reloy Garcia describes his reassessment of the work when asked to update his original Study Guide to Winter: \\"The book I then so impetuously criticized as somewhat thin, now strikes me as a deeply penetrating study of the American condition. I did not realize, at the time, that we had a condition,\\" and he attributes this change of heart to \\"our own enriched experience\\". In 1983 Carol Ann Kasparek condemned the character of Ethan for his implausibility, and still called Steinbeck‚Äôs treatment of American moral decay superficial, although she went on to approve the story's mythic elements. Professor of literature and Steinbeck scholar Stephen K. George wrote, \\"With these authors [ Saul Bellow, Brent Weeks, and Ruth Stiles Gannett ] I would contend that, given its multi-layered complexity, intriguing artistry, and clear moral purpose, The Winter of Our Discontent ranks in the upper echelon of Steinbeck‚Äôs fiction, alongside Of Mice and Men, Cannery Row, East of Eden, and, of course, The Grapes of Wrath\\". The novel was the last that Steinbeck completed before his death in 1968. The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights and the screenplay for Zapata were both published posthumously in unfinished forms. Narrative point of view Steinbeck makes use of an unusual structural device in Winter, switching between three different styles of narrative points of view. The novel is presented in two halves, Part One and Part Two, and each half starts with two chapters written in third person narration. After these two chapters in each half, the point of view changes to first person, narrated by the protagonist, Ethan Hawley. The four chapters in third person narrative are mostly presented from the point of view of Ethan, but not in first person, a technique known as free indirect discourse, or free indirect speech. There are two exceptions to this: the first is an interlude at the start of chapter twelve where the point of view switches to that of Margie: \\"when a more intimate view is needed of the seductress Margie Young- Hunt . . . the third person narrative reappears.\\" The second exception is the interlude at the start of chapter eleven which is presented by the author as an omniscient narrator, before the chapter reverts to Ethan's point of view. The three different narrative styles are therefore: omniscient narrator (Chapter 11 part); free indirect discourse from multiple points of view (Chapters 1,2,11,12); and first person narrative from a single point of view (the rest of the book). Themes A major theme found in The Winter of Our Discontent is the effect of societal pressure. At the beginning of the novel, Ethan Hawley is unhappy with his job as a grocery store clerk, but it is the complaints from his wife and kids about their social and economic status that drive his character to change his beliefs about wealth and power. He is also influenced by close acquaintances who encourage him to accept bribes and speak in ways where money is the most important thing in their lives. For example, Ethan‚Äôs banker friend Joey Morphy exemplifies how important money is by saying ‚Äúyour only entrance is money‚Äù (144), and ‚Äúwe all bow down to the Great God Currency‚Äù (132). This man‚Äôs life revolved around money and making more of it. Later in the novel, Ethan plans out a bank robbery and would have acted on it had it not been for a last minute distraction. In the land situation with Danny, Ethan plays the role of the kind friend, but ultimately receives the important piece of land that other men were competing for as well. His greed and lust for power catch up to Ethan at the end of the novel when he realizes his own son plagiarized for the ‚ÄúWhy I Love America‚Äù contest. But the purpose of entering the contest was not to show love for his country, ‚Äúbut rather to draw some materialistic gains from it like a watch and trip, in addition to showing up on TV.\\" Ethan is guilty for his actions and as a result, is suicidal. Film adaptation The novel was made into a television movie for the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1983, featuring Donald Sutherland, Teri Garr, and Tuesday Weld.

Qadian is the birthplace of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. It remained the centre of the Ahmadiyya movement until the Partition of India in 1947. History Qadian was established in 1530 by Mirza Hadi Baig, a religious scholar dedicated to Islam and the first Qazi in the area. Mirza Hadi Baig was from a royal household of Mirza of the Mughal Empire. He migrated from Samarkand and settled in Punjab where he was granted a vast tract of land comprising 80 villages by the emperor Babur. Because of his religious beliefs, he named the center of the 80 villages Islam Pur Qazi and governed from there. Over time, the name of the town changed to Qazi Maji, then Qadi, and eventually it became known as 'Qadian'. Qadian and the surrounding areas later fell to the Ramgharia Sikhs who offered the ruling Qazis, two villages which they refused. In 1834, during the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the region consisting of Qadian and five adjoining villages was given to Mirza Ghulam Murtaza, father of Ghulam Ahmad in return for military support in Kashmir, Mahadi, the Kulu valley, Peshawar and Hazara. Members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community who spoke 47 different languages in Qadian. =As the home of the Ahmadiyya Movement= A remote and unknown town, Qadian emerged as a centre of religious learning in 1889, when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad established the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, and in 1891 it became the venue for the Community's annual gatherings. Qadian remained the administrative headquarters and capital of the Ahmadiyya Caliphate until the partition of India in 1947, when much of the Community migrated to Pakistan. Following the partition, Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, the second Khalifa of the Community, carefully oversaw the safe migration of Ahmadis from Qadian to the newly founded state, instructing 313 men, including two of his own sons, to stay in Qadian and guard the sites holy to Ahmadis, conferring upon them the title darveshƒÅn-i qƒÅdiyƒÅn (the dervishes of Qadian) and eventually moving the headquarters to Rabwah, Pakistan.

Battle cries are not necessarily articulate (e.g. \\"Eulaliaaaa!\\", \\"Alala\\"..), although they often aim to invoke patriotic or religious sentiment. Their purpose is a combination of arousing aggression and esprit de corps on one's own side and causing intimidation on the hostile side. Battle cries are a universal form of display behaviour (i.e., threat display) aiming at competitive advantage, ideally by overstating one's own aggressive potential to a point where the enemy prefers to avoid confrontation altogether and opts to flee. In order to overstate one's potential for aggression, battle cries need to be as loud as possible, and have historically often been amplified by acoustic devices such as horns, drums, conches, carnyxes, bagpipes, bugles, etc. (see also martial music). Battle cries are closely related to other behavioral patterns of human aggression, such as war dances and taunting, performed during the \\"warming up\\" phase preceding the escalation of physical violence. From the Middle Ages, many cries appeared on standards and were adopted as mottoes, an example being the motto \\"Dieu et mon droit\\" (\\"God and my right\\") of the English kings. It is said that this was Edward III's rallying cry during the Battle of Cr√©cy. The word \\"slogan\\" originally derives from sluagh-gairm or sluagh-ghairm (sluagh = \\"people\\", \\"army\\", and gairm = \\"call\\", \\"proclamation\\"), the Scottish Gaelic word for \\"gathering-cry\\" and in times of war for \\"battle-cry\\".

Canadian rock band Three Days Grace appeared in this movie as special guests, performing the songs \\"Are You Ready\\" and \\"Home\\". Raise Your Voice stars Hilary Duff. Plot Terri Fletcher is a teenager with a passion for singing and dreams of becoming a professional singer. She wants to participate in a music program that could give her a $10,000 scholarship. Her overprotective father Simon, a second-generation restaurateur, disapproves of Terri's plans, stating that being a singer may not be a worthwhile life choice. Simon believes that Terri will get hurt if she goes to Los Angeles and would prefer if she continues running the family business. Simon thinks this is the only way to keep Terri safe. Terri is very close to her elder brother Paul, who fully supports her dream, despite what their father says. At Paul's graduation-day barbecue, he has a fight with Simon, who, in the heat of it, grounds his son. Terri sneaks Paul out of the house to attend a Three Days Grace concert. On the way back, Paul was planning on going to college and leaving right now. They have a car accident and are hit by a drunk driver. Terri awakens in the hospital, where she learns that Paul was killed. Terri blames herself for Paul's death. She wants to quit singing and not attend the music program. Terri tells her mother, Frances, that if she hadn't convinced Paul to sneak out to the concert he'd still be alive. However, Frances explains that it's not her fault and that Paul would have wanted Terri to attend the program. She eventually convinces Terri to go. Frances tells Simon that Terri plans to stay with her aunt Nina in Palm DesertEbert, Roger (October 8, 2004). \\"Raise Your Voice\\". Chicago Sun-Times for the summer and allows her daughter to travel to Los Angeles. Terri arrives in Los Angeles and weathers some difficult ordeals: her jacket is stolen, her cab driver is crabby, and when she arrives at the music school at night, the door is locked; fellow student Jay lets her in and Terri arrives safely. While at the program, Terri makes new friends and learns a great deal about music, but problems arise when she is plagued by memories of the car crash which took Paul's life and finds it increasingly difficult to keep her participation in the program a secret from her father. Throughout the film, Terri develops a mutual fondness for Jay, but she faces competition from Robin Childers, who was involved with Jay the previous summer. Although Robin still harbors feelings for Jay, he does not reciprocate these feelings. Jay tries to get Robin to cease her efforts to keep him and Terri apart. On one occasion, she kisses him just as Terri walks in. Jay pushes Robin away, but Terri runs off in tears, ignoring Jay's insistence that the kiss meant nothing. Later, finding him drunk, Terri and her roommate Denise take Jay to the roof to sober up. When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song they have been working on for the scholarship contest. At home, Simon learns of Terri's ruse and becomes furious. Simon then drives to Los Angeles to bring Terri home in an effort to keep her safe. On the final day, Simon comes to the school and Terri finds him packing up her belongings; he reams Terri for disobeying and deceiving him, and for turning his own sister and wife against him. Terri begged her father not to make same mistake like he did with Paul and make her run. She begs him to let her finish what she started and not let the summer go to waste. Ultimately, realizing how selfish he had been acting, concedes and allows her to perform. Terri and Jay then perform the song they wrote with Terri dedicating it to Paul. Even though Denise wins the scholarship prize, Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents. He is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simon's own (their argument, and Paul's subsequent restriction to his bedroom). Terri's teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might. Over the end credits, Terri performs for her parents and Nina, with Jay cheering her on.

The parish area is about . The village lies ‚Äì above sea level on the north face of an ironstone ridge. Its highest point is above sea level, at Windmill Hill about south-east of the village. The Leam and several streams feeding it rise in the parish. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population (including Lower and Upper Catesby) of 256. The Jurassic Way long-distance footpath linking Banbury, Oxfordshire and Stamford, Lincolnshire passes through. Manors The Domesday Book of 1086 does not record Hellidon. In the 12th century a manor of four hides (about 49 ha) at \\"Eliden\\" was recorded as being of the fee of Berkhamsted. From the 13th century Hellidon had two manors: Baskervilles and Giffords. The present manor house at the north-west end of the village is on the site of the former Baskervilles Manor. Giffords Manor was on the north-east side of the village ‚Äì there are substantial rectilinear earthworks where the house is said to have stood. The house had been abandoned by the time of Hellidon's 18th-century land surveys. Church and chapel =Church of England= The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist is Decorated Gothic and hence either late 13th or early 14th century. The west tower survives in its medieval condition but in 1845‚Äì47 the nave and chancel were heavily restored for the Rev C. S. Holthouse under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield. Twenty years later Butterfield designed the north aisle and the parish school, both of which were built in 1867. In 1897 a north aisle was added to the chancel, designed by Matthew Houlding. There is also a north transept. St John's is now a Grade II* listed building. The west tower has a ring of five bells. Hugh II Watts, who had foundries at Bedford and Leicester, cast the fourth bell in 1615 and the second, third and tenor bells in 1635. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1993. =Nonconformist= Hellidon had a Nonconformist chapel in Berry Lane. The building is now a private house. Economic and social history Converted tower mill on Windmill Hill Until the 1770s an open field system of farming prevailed in the parish. There were five open fields, and in 1726 they were mapped as Further Field, Lower Field, Middle Field, Upper Field and Short Attle Field. In 1774 Parliament passed an enclosure act for Hellidon and in 1775 the parish was surveyed for enclosure. On this map what had been Middle Field was marked as Hill Field and what had been Short Attle Field was simply Attle Field. On Windmill Hill a tower mill was built in the late 18th or early 19th century. By 1973 it was derelict, but since then the tower has been restored. It is no longer a mill, but an ancillary building for the Windmill Vineyard planted around it. A friendly society called the Institute was founded in Hellidon in 1805. It still existed in 1905, when it celebrated its centenary. The earliest known record of a post office in Hellidon is from 1847. The first postmaster was John Wells, who described himself as a shoemaker in the 1841 Census but as a shopkeeper in 1849. By 1854 he was described as \\"Postmaster and Letter Receiver\\". The Grange is a house designed by William Butterfield and built for Rev. C. S. Holthouse. The core is a small older house that Holthouse bought, but Butterfield enlarged for him in 1850 and again in 1861. It is a Grade II* listed building. Hellidon's highest recorded population was 449, in 1861. In August 1904 a fire in Cox's Lane destroyed three thatched cottages. =Railways= The Great Central Main Line from the north of England to was built in the 1890s. It passed through the eastern edge of the parish in the Catesby Tunnel, which was started in 1895 and completed in 1897. One of the tunnel's five air shafts is in Hellidon parish. The line opened for goods traffic in 1898 and its nearest passenger station opened in March 1899 at , about south-east of Hellidon village. British Railways closed the station in March 1963 and the line in September 1966. From 1917 until 1961 the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company had a quarry about south of the village, on the southern boundary with Charwelton parish. From there it ran a mineral railway down the Cherwell valley to take ironstone to the main line at Charwelton station. A steam locomotive called Charwelton was built for the line in 1917, worked it until 1942, and is now preserved on the Kent and East Sussex Railway. =Notable person= *George Harry Dury (1916‚Äì1996), geographer and hydrologist, was born at Hellidon.

He was, along with Hugh Walpole and J. M. Barrie, a leading pre-war novelist of boyhood. He is still acclaimed as the greatest of Ulster novelists and was recognised with the award of the 1944 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel Young Tom. Early life and education Born in Belfast, he was the youngest son of a Protestant family of twelve, six of whom survived. His father, Robert Reid (1825‚Äì1881), was the manager of a felt works, having failed as a shipowner at Liverpool,https://www.qub.ac.uk/directorates/InformationServices/TheLibrary/SpecialCollections/FileStore/Filetoupload,809270,en.pdf and came from a well-established upper-middle-class Ulster family; his mother, Frances Matilda, was his father's second wife. She was the daughter of Captain Robert Parr, of the 54th Regiment of Foot, of the landed gentry Parr family of Shropshire, related to Catherine Parr, last wife of King Henry VIII.A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland Vol. II, 4th edition, Sir Bernard Burke, 1863, p. 1153, Parr of Parr pedigreeThe Green Avenue: The Life and Writings of Forrest Reid, 1875-1947, Brian Taylor, Cambridge University Press, 1980, p. 8https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-35714?rskey=ZNpkfa&result;=1https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/cddb76c9-fbe6-3b99-9f7a-7a2fe31bbabb Although proud of this ancestry, he found the strict Protestant ethics of his immediate family constricting. His father's death left the family in straitened circumstances. Reid was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, after which he was initially apprenticed into the Belfast tea- trade before going to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read medieval and modern languages, and was influenced by the novelist E. M. Forster. Despite this, he described his Cambridge experience as 'a rather blank interlude' in life. Graduating in 1908, he returned to Belfast to pursue a writing career; his first book, The Kingdom of Twilight, had been published in 1904. A plaque reading \\"Forrest Reid lived here 1924‚Äì1947\\" on a house at 13 Ormiston Crescent, Belfast. After graduation Forster continued to visit Reid, who was then settled back in Belfast. In 1952, Forster traveled to Belfast to unveil a plaque commemorating Forrest Reid's life (at 13 Ormiston Crescent). Works and influences As well as his fiction, Reid also translated poems from the Greek Anthology (Greek Authors (Faber, 1943)). His study of the work of W. B. Yeats (W. B. Yeats: A Critical Study (1915)) has been acclaimed as one of the best critical studies of that poet. He also wrote the definitive work on the English woodcut artists of the 1860s (Illustrators of the Sixties (1928)); his collection of original illustrations from that time is housed in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. He was a close friend of Walter de la Mare, whom he first met in 1913, and about whose fiction he published a perceptive book in 1929. Reid was also an influence on novelist Stephen Gilbert, and had good connections to the Bloomsbury Group of writers. Reid was a founding member of the Imperial Art League (later the Artists League of Great Britain). Reid was also a close friend of Arthur Greeves, the artist known to be C. S. Lewis's best friend. Greeves painted several portraits of Reid, now all in the possession of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He published articles in many magazines, including Uladh, The Westminster Review and the Ulster Review, and he reviewed books for the Manchester Guardian. Apostate, an autobiography, was published in 1926, and its sequel, Private Road, was published in 1940. He was a founder member of the Irish Academy of Letters. Critical standing Though his books are not necessarily well-known today, he has been labelled 'the first Ulster novelist of European stature', and comparisons have been drawn between his own coming of age novel of Protestant Belfast, Following Darkness (1912), and James Joyce's seminal novel of growing up in Catholic Dublin, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). Reid's fiction, which often uses submerged narratives to explore male beauty and love, can be placed within the historical context of the emergence of a more explicit expression of homosexuality in English literature in the 20th century. A \\"Forrest Reid Collection\\" is held at the University of Exeter, consisting of first editions of all his works and books about Reid. Many of his original manuscripts are in the archives of the Belfast Central Library.

Early life and education Al-Qudsi was born in Aleppo on February 14, 1906. After receiving his high school degree in the Aleppo American College, Qudsi obtained his university degree in law from Damascus University. He received a master's degree from the American University of Beirut (AUB), and PhD from the University of Geneva. Early career After his education, Qudsi returned to Syria in 1935 and joined the National Bloc, the leading anti-French independence movement, and became one of its prominent members in Aleppo. It was a political organization aimed at the emancipation from French control through diplomatic means rather than armed resistance. In 1936, he ran for Parliament on a Bloc ticket and won. He clashed with the Bloc leadership that failed to prevent the annexation of Alexandretta to Turkey in 1939, he resigned from Bloc ranks. Qudsi created a coalition of Aleppine intellectuals around himself and Rushdie Kikhia, another lawyer who shared in his views, and the two men nominated themselves for Parliament in 1943, winning with ease. They lobbied against the election of Shukri al-Kuwatli, a National Bloc leader, as president, but Kuwatli was voted into office in August 1943. To appease the opposition, the new President appointed Qudsi as Syria's first Ambassador to the United States. Qudsi founded the Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C. from scratch, and on March 19, 1945 presented his credentials to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1947, he and Rushdi al-Kikhiya founded the People's Party in Aleppo. It was inaugurated as an opposition movement to the Kuwatli regime and created to counterbalance the political weight of the National Party, the successor to the National Bloc, loyal to Kuwatli. The People's Party founders were mainly notables from Aleppo who aimed at creating union between Syria and Iraq, maintaining a democratic government, and advocating stronger ties with the West. The Hashemite royal family in Baghdad supported the party and funded many of its activities. In 1947, Qudsi ran for Parliament on a party ticket and won. His election was repeated in 1949, 1954, and 1962. He voted against the re-election of Kuwatli as president, but a parliamentary majority pushed through the election. On March 29, 1949, the Kuwatli administration was toppled by a military coup d'√©tat, launched by Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im. Syria's new ruler asked Qudsi to form a government but he declined, claiming that the Za‚Äôim regime was unconstitutional and arguing that despite his faults, Kuwatli was a constitutionally elected president while Za‚Äôim was an ‚Äúillegal‚Äù one. As a result, Za‚Äôim had him arrested and the People's Party was shut down. He was released shortly afterwards and placed under house arrest in Aleppo. He became highly critical of Za‚Äôim when the latter closed Syria's border with Jordan and Iraq and threatened to go to war with both countries, accusing them of being agents of Great Britain in the Middle East. On August 14, 1949, he supported a coup that toppled and killed Za‚Äôim, launched by General Sami al-Hinnawi, an old friend of the People's Party and an ally of the Hashemite royals in Baghdad. Hinnawi created a political committee to run political affairs in the absence of an official government and appointed Qudsi to its top leadership. Qudsi also served on the Constitutional Assembly that drafted a new constitution for Syria and became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first post-Za‚Äôim cabinet of Prime Minister Hashim al-Atassi (an ally of the People's Party as well as a founding member and former president of the National Bloc). His ally Kikhiya became Minister of Interior while other posts were distributed accordingly to members of the People's Party and independents who also opposed the old regime.al-Hawrani, Akram. Mudhakkirat Akram al-Hawrani. Four Volumes, Muktabat al-Baduni, Cairo, 2000, pp. 1010-1015. Qudsi conducted talks with Crown Prince Abd al-Illah of Iraq for creating immediate union between Syria and Iraq and made numerous journeys to Baghdad for the purpose. He formulated an agreement that called for federal union, preserving independent governments in Damascus and Baghdad while coordinating military, economic, social, cultural, and political affairs between the two states. He then went to Cairo and proposed a similar program for all Arab states at the Arab League on January 1, 1951. The United Arab Republic Nazim al-Qudsi (back row, far right) attending the inauguration of President Hashim al-Atassi in 1936. To advance union talks, al-Atassi, who had recently been elected president of the republic, called on Qudsi to form a government on December 24, 1949. The latter complied, but military officers vetoed his cabinet and he resigned from office five days after coming to power. The officers argued that his government did not include an officer among its midst and that many of its members were declared opponents of officer meddling in political affairs. On June 4, 1950, Qudsi created a new government, less extremist than the first, and was able to secure its approval by appointing General Fawzi Selu as Minister of Defense. Selu was the right-hand-man of General Adib al-Shishakli, the military strongman of Syria. The cabinet lived for ten months, but was unable to take the union issue any further. Qudsi resigned on March 27, 1951. On October 1, 1951, he was elected Speaker of Parliament. Shortly afterwards, on November 28, Adib al-Shishakli seized power in Damascus and arrested the entire People's Party leadership, accusing them of wanting to topple Syria's republican regime and replace it with a monarchical one that was loyal to Britain and Iraq. He appointed Selu as provisional head of state and arrested Qudsi, sending him to Mezzeh prison. He was released in January 1952 but placed under house arrest. He joined the underground and worked in secret against Shishakli, supporting a coup d'√©tat that brought him down in February 1954. In October 1954, Nazim al-Qudsi became a deputy in the first post- Shishakli Parliament and was elected speaker on October 14, 1954. He tried to regain some of his influence in political circles, but by that time, the People's Party had fallen from grace, and few Syrians advocated union with Iraq. Instead, they wanted union with Egypt, under the rising leadership of the young and charismatic President Gamal Abd al-Nasser. In vain, Qudsi tried challenging Nasser's authority. He advocated pro-British and pro-American views at a time when the majority of Syrians had become pro-Soviet Union. He called on Syria to join the Baghdad Pact, an Anglo-American treaty to contain Communism, and pro-Nasser newspapers accused him of working as an agent for the Hashemites. On October 12, 1957, Qudsi resigned from office and was replaced by the pro-Nasser socialist leader, Akram al-Hawrani. He voted against the Syrian-Egyptian union and when the two countries merged to form the United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1958, he resigned from public life altogether and retired to Aleppo. =International relations after the UAR= On September 28, 1961, a new coup took place in Syria and toppled the UAR government. Qudsi rallied to its support and nominated himself for the first post-union Parliament, becoming a deputy for Aleppo in December 1961. He then ran for presidential office and won, becoming the first post-Nasser leader of Syria on December 12, 1961. As president, he worked to restore Syria's friendship with the anti-Nasser regimes in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, and build bridges with the United States and Great Britain. The Hashemite family in Baghdad, which had supported his career for the past thirty years, had been toppled by a bloody military revolution in July 1958. He was never on good terms with the new leaders of Iraq, especially the revolt leader, General Abd al-Karim Qasim. The West, particularly President John F. Kennedy, welcomed Qudsi's ascent and labeled him a \\"friend\\" of the United States. To promote Syria's relations with Washington, Qudsi appointed Omar Abu-Riche, a renowned poet from Aleppo who like him, was an AUB graduate, as ambassador in the years 1961‚Äì1963. He began a massive economic reform program, restoring factories that had been nationalized by Nasser when he headed the UAR, and dismissing all pro-Nasser officials from office. All officers who were still loyal to the Egyptian President were discharged from the Syrian Army. Qudsi drafted a new constitution for Syria, restored the outlawed political parties, and received loans from the World Bank for rebuilding Syria's dislocated economy. Exile President Qudsi clashed with the officers that had brought him to power and tried to marginalize their role in political affairs. He appointed Maarouf al- Dawalibi, a veteran of the People's Party with declared anti-officer views, as Prime Minister. Bitter from his experience with the officers since the Shishakli era, Dawalibi began curbing their influence in all state affairs and centralizing matters in the hands of Qudsi and the government. On March 28, 1962, a coup d'√©tat took place in Syria, launched by Colonel Abd al-Karim al- Nahlawi. He arrested Qudsi and Dawalibi, accusing them of misusing their powers and persecuting the officers of the Syrian Army. A counter coup broke out on April 2, headed by Chief of Staff Abd al-Karim Zahr al-Din, who ordered all troops to stand by President Qudsi. The army complied, releasing Qudsi from prison and restoring the dissolved Parliament. Qudsi refused to arrest or kill Nehlawi, but rather, curbed his power by appointing him military attach√© to Indonesia‚Äîa purely ceremonial post. He then tried to appease the officers and the socialists by calling on Bashir al-Azma, a doctor who had been close to Nasser and who held office as Minister of Health under the UAR, to become Prime Minister in April 1962. His cabinet included members of the socialist Ba'ath Party that was pro-Nasser. Qudsi and Azma dispatched Foreign Minister Adnan al-Azhari to Cairo to mend relations with the Egyptian President. When that failed, however, they filed a complaint to the Arab League, accusing him of wanting to destabilize Syria through interfering in its domestic affairs and calling on the army to rebel against the government. On March 8, 1963, however, another coup d'√©tat took place in Syria, launched by the Military Committee of the Ba'ath Party. The officers who came to power pledged to restore the UAR and had Qudsi arrested. He was released after a while. He moved to Lebanon, Europe, and finally to Jordan where he lived in exile until his death in February 1998.

It dates back to the time of the Korean War of the early 1950s. Although it has a nominal weight of 3,000 lb (1,350 kg), its actual weight, depending on fuse and retardation options, is somewhat higher. A typical non-retarded configuration has a total weight of 3,049 lb (1,383 kg) with an explosive content of 1,975 lb (895 kg) of tritonal. This is a higher percentage than in the more recent American Mark 80 series bombs thus perhaps the designation as a demolition bomb. In the late 1950s through the early 1970s it was a standard aircraft weapon, carried by the F-100 Super Sabre, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, and F-4 Phantom. Some apparently remain in the USAF inventory, although they are rarely used today. It was a component of the GBU-9/B version of the Rockwell electro-optically guided Homing Bomb System (HOBOS). This weapon consisted of a M-118 fitted with a KMU-390/B guidance kit with an image contrast seeker, strakes and cruciform tail fins to guide the bomb to its target. It was also used in the Texas Instruments Paveway I series of laser-guided bombs as the GBU-11 when it was fitted with the KMU-388 seeker head, MAU-157 Computer Control Group and the MXU-602 Airfoil Group. This latter consisted of four fixed cruciform fins and four moveable canards to control the bomb's trajectory. It was also fitted with an AIM-9B Sidewinder infra-red seeker and an AGM-45 Shrike nose cone during 1967 tests at the Naval Ordnance Test Station China Lake, presumably in an attempt to create an infra-red guided bomb.http://www.chinalakealumni.org/1967/1967mo.htm#thumb This was called the Bombwinder.

It was founded in 1963 as Saginaw Valley College. It is located on 748 acres in Saginaw County's Kochville Township, approximately 5.5 miles north of downtown Saginaw. It is the youngest of Michigan's 15 public colleges and universities. SVSU offers over 100 academic programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels with approximately 8,500 students at its main campus in University Center. SVSU offers programs of study in its five colleges. History Higher education in the Saginaw Valley region dates back to the founding of Bay City Junior College in 1922. Though the junior college was replaced by Delta College in 1961, the area still lacked a four-year baccalaureate institution. Saginaw Valley College was founded as a private institution in November 1963, and became a state-supported institution in 1965. The name changed to Saginaw Valley State College in 1974 and again to Saginaw Valley State University in 1987. =Beginnings= In 1955, civic leaders in the Saginaw Valley region met to discuss prospects for a local institution of higher education. The next year, a committee of 300 recommended a two-year community college which would expand to a four-year college. The two-year college, Delta, was approved by voters in 1958 and opened in 1961. =Saginaw Valley College= Articles of incorporation for what would become Saginaw Valley College (originally called Delta Senior University) were drawn up in 1963, and the state granted a charter to SVC as a private, four-year liberal arts institution. Dr. Samuel D. Marble, the president of Delta College, was appointed president of SVC in 1964. After holding both presidencies for four months, he resigned from Delta. The first class of 119 students completed two years at Delta and transferred to SVC. The first commencement ceremony was held in 1966 at a Midland church for a graduating class of ten. A site for a permanent SVC campus (the college was operating out of Delta's basement) was chosen in Kochville Township in 1966 and classes were moved to a building on that site the next year. Ground was broken for what would become Wickes Hall in the late summer. Saginaw Valley College received full accreditation by the North Central Association in April 1970. The college's athletic teams were named the Redbirds, shortly thereafter changed to Cardinals after two coaches spotted a kitchen decoration with a cardinal on it at a golf tournament in Kentucky. In 1972, the Cardinals became a charter member of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and in 1974 Frank \\"Muddy\\" Waters was hired as the college's first football coach. =Saginaw Valley State College= The name changed to Saginaw Valley State College in 1974. That same year, Samuel D. Marble, the college's president who had also served in that role at Delta College, submitted his resignation. Marble had also served as president of Wilmington College in Ohio. He would be named president emeritus and is honored with a lecture hall named in his honor in Wickes Hall. In November 1974, Jack M. Ryder became president of the college. A report by the Michigan Efficiency Task Force in 1977 recommended to then-Governor William G. Milliken that SVSC and Delta could be run more efficiently if they were combined, an idea which gained no traction. In 1980 the Higher Learning Commission/North Central Association continued this accreditation and granted accreditation at the master's degree level. Both accreditations have been retained continuously since the original accreditation. Also in 1980, two Japanese students attended SVSC for two weeks, beginning what is now a flourishing international student enrollment. A fire in 1985 destroyed financial records, registration files, and other important records. The college became home to the works of the noted sculptor Marshall M. Fredericks in June 1987. =Saginaw Valley State University= On November 5, 1987, SVSC became Saginaw Valley State University. Dr. Jack Ryder resigned as president in 1989 and Eric R. Gilbertson succeeded him. An off- campus location was opened in Cass City in 1991. In 2000, George W. Bush visited the Ryder Center days before the election where he would be elected President of the United States. The annual Battle of the Valleys, a fundraising competition against rival Grand Valley State University, was established in 2003. In 2009, SVSU alumnus Tony Ceccacci was the lead flight director for STS-125, a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, and an SVSU pennant was sent to space on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis. The pennant is currently on display in Pioneer Hall. On June 18, 2013, President Gilbertson announced his intention to retire when the university's board of control finds his replacement. Ming Chuan University, the first Asian university to be accredited in the United States, opened their Michigan Campus in Gilbertson Hall in 2014. In 2015, SVSU applied to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to receive a Community Engagement Classification. To be selected, institutions provide descriptions and examples of institutionalized practices of community engagement that showed alignment among mission, culture, leadership, resources and practices. The designation is in effect for 10 years. 50th Anniversary In 2013, SVSU celebrated its 50th anniversary with a gala banquet on November 9 and various events throughout the year, including an economic summit on October 25. The university also launched a fundraising campaign entitled \\"Talent. Opportunity. Promise.\\" with the goal of raising $25 million. =Presidents= Dr. Samuel Davey Marble served as president of SVC from March 23, 1964 to January 14, 1974. He had been the first president of Delta College, from 1958 to 1964. The lecture hall in Wickes Hall was named in his honor, the Gladys and Samuel Marble Graduate Business Scholarship Fund was established in 1997, and the Samuel Marble Memorial Scholarship was established in 1990 to be awarded to a transfer student from Delta. Dr. Jack McBride Ryder served as president of SVSC/SVSU from November 1, 1974 to June 30, 1989. He initiated the successful construction of Brown Hall, the Zahnow Library, the science building, and the Ryder Center. He was also instrumental in raising private gifts for the construction of Pioneer Hall, the Arbury Fine Arts Center, the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum, and Wickes Stadium. Due to his leadership, SVSC, Grand Valley State College, Ferris State College, and Lake Superior State College were all elevated to universities by legislation signed on November 4, 1987. Dr. Ryder was named a president emeritus of the University on December 13, 1991. Dr. Eric R. Gilbertson was inaugurated as president of SVSU on August 29, 1989, and served as the longest-tenured in SVSU's history. During his tenure, the university's endowment has increased twenty-fold and the campus physical plant has tripled in size. Enrollment nearly doubled during his tenure. Gilbertson is a former president of Johnson State College in Vermont and was the executive assistant to the president of Ohio State University as well as legal counsel to the Ohio Board of Regents. Dr. Gilbertson announced his intention to retire in 2013 upon the appointment of his successor. On February 10, 2014, Dr. Donald Bachand, the university's provost and academic vice president, was named SVSU's fourth president. He officially took office February 17 and was formally installed June 22. Accreditations Saginaw Valley State University was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association as a baccalaureate degree granting institution in 1970. In 1980 the HLC/NCA continued this accreditation and granted accreditation at the master's degree level. Both accreditations have been retained continuously since the original accreditation. SVSU also has ten programs that have been awarded specialized accreditations, including being selected by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to receive its 2015 Community Engagement Classification, marking SVSU as a university that is exceptionally engaged with the community it serves.

It may also be designed for land reclamation after mining, or as a mitigation step for natural areas lost to land development. Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use natural functions vegetation, soil, and organisms to treat wastewater. Depending on the type of wastewater the design of the constructed wetland has to be adjusted accordingly. Constructed wetlands have been used to treat both centralized and on-site wastewater. Primary treatment is recommended when there is a large amount of suspended solids or soluble organic matter (measured as BOD and COD). Similarly to natural wetlands, constructed wetlands also act as a biofilter and/or can remove a range of pollutants (such as organic matter, nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals) from the water. Constructed wetlands are a sanitation technology that have not been designed specifically for pathogen removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). All types of pathogens (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoan and helminths) are expected to be removed to some extent in a constructed wetland. Subsurface wetland provide greater pathogen removal than surface wetlands. There are two main types of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow and surface flow constructed wetlands. The planted vegetation plays an important role in contaminant removal. The filter bed, consisting usually of sand and gravel, has an equally important role to play. Some constructed wetlands may also serve as a habitat for native and migratory wildlife, although that is not their main purpose. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands are designed to have either horizontal flow or vertical flow of water through the gravel and sand bed. Vertical flow systems have a smaller space requirement than horizontal flow systems.  Terminology  Many terms are used to denote constructed wetlands, such as reed beds, soil infiltration beds, treatment wetlands, engineered wetlands, man-made or artificial wetlands.Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von M√ºnch, E., Winker, M. (2011): Technology review of constructed wetlands ‚Äì Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment. Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany A biofilter has some similarities with a constructed wetland, but is usually without plants. The term of constructed wetlands can also be used to describe restored and recultivated land that was destroyed in the past through draining and converting into farmland, or mining.  Overview  Effluent from a constructed wetland for greywater treatment at an ecological housing estate in Hamburg-Allermoehe, Germany Constructed wetland for domestic wastewater treatment in Bayawan City, the Philippines A constructed wetland is an engineered sequence of water bodies designed to filter and treat waterborne pollutants found in sewage, industrial effluent or storm water runoff. Constructed wetlands are used for wastewater treatment or for greywater treatment. They can be used after a septic tank for primary treatment (or other types of systems) in order to separate the solids from the liquid effluent. Some constructed wetland designs however do not use upfront primary treatment. Vegetation in a wetland provides a substrate (roots, stems, and leaves) upon which microorganisms can grow as they break down organic materials. This community of microorganisms is known as the periphyton. The periphyton and natural chemical processes are responsible for approximately 90 percent of pollutant removal and waste breakdown. The plants remove about seven to ten percent of pollutants, and act as a carbon source for the microbes when they decay. Different species of aquatic plants have different rates of heavy metal uptake, a consideration for plant selection in a constructed wetland used for water treatment. Constructed wetlands are of two basic types: subsurface flow and surface flow wetlands. Constructed wetlands are one example of nature-based solutions and of phytoremediation. Many regulatory agencies list treatment wetlands as one of their recommended \\"best management practices\\" for controlling urban runoff.For example, see Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, Denver, CO. \\"Treatment BMP Fact Sheets:\\" * \\"T-08. Constructed Wetland Pond\\" (Nov. 2015) and * \\"T-09. Constructed Wetland Channel\\" (Nov. 2010). Part of the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual, Volume 3. Removal of contaminants Physical, chemical, and biological processes combine in wetlands to remove contaminants from wastewater. An understanding of these processes is fundamental not only to designing wetland systems but to understanding the fate of chemicals once they enter the wetland. Theoretically, wastewater treatment within a constructed wetland occurs as it passes through the wetland medium and the plant rhizosphere. A thin film around each root hair is aerobic due to the leakage of oxygen from the rhizomes, roots, and rootlets. Aerobic and anaerobic micro- organisms facilitate decomposition of organic matter. Microbial nitrification and subsequent denitrification releases nitrogen as gas to the atmosphere. Phosphorus is coprecipitated with iron, aluminium, and calcium compounds located in the root-bed medium.Brix, H., Schierup, H. (1989): Danish experience with sewage treatment in constructed wetlands. In: Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 565‚Äì573 Suspended solids filter out as they settle in the water column in surface flow wetlands or are physically filtered out by the medium within subsurface flow wetlands. Harmful bacteria and viruses are reduced by filtration and adsorption by biofilms on the gravel or sand media in subsurface flow and vertical flow systems. =Nitrogen removal= The dominant forms of nitrogen in wetlands that are of importance to wastewater treatment include organic nitrogen, ammonia, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite. Total nitrogen refers to all nitrogen species. Wastewater nitrogen removal is important because of ammonia‚Äôs toxicity to fish if discharged into watercourses. Excessive nitrates in drinking water is thought to cause methemoglobinemia in infants, which decreases the blood's oxygen transport ability. Moreover, excess input of N from point and non-point sources to surface water promotes eutrophication in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans which causes several problems in aquatic ecosystems e.g. toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion in water, fish mortality, loss of aquatic biodiversity.Carpenter, S.R., Caraco, N.F., Correll, D.L., Howarth, R.W., Sharpley, A.N. & Smith, V.H. (1998) Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen.Ecological Applications, 8, 559‚Äì568. Ammonia removal occurs in constructed wetlands ‚Äì if they are designed to achieve biological nutrient removal ‚Äì in a similar ways as in sewage treatment plants, except that no external, energy-intensive addition of air (oxygen) is needed. It is a two-step process, consisting of nitrification followed by denitrification. The nitrogen cycle is completed as follows: ammonia in the wastewater is converted to ammonium ions; the aerobic bacterium Nitrosomonas sp. oxidizes ammonium to nitrite; the bacterium Nitrobacter sp. then converts nitrite to nitrate. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is reduced to relatively harmless nitrogen gas that enters the atmosphere.  Nitrification  Nitrification is the biological conversion of organic and inorganic nitrogenous compounds from a reduced state to a more oxidized state, based on the action of two different bacteria types.Wetzel, R.G. (1983): Limnology. Orlando, Florida: Saunders college publishing. Nitrification is strictly an aerobic process in which the end product is nitrate (). The process of nitrification oxidizes ammonium (from the wastewater) to nitrite (), and then nitrite is oxidized to nitrate ().  Denitrification  Denitrification is the biochemical reduction of oxidized nitrogen anions, nitrate and nitrite to produce the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide () and nitrogen gas (), with concomitant oxidation of organic matter. The end product, , and to a lesser extent the intermediary by product, , are gases that re-enter the atmosphere. Ammonia removal from mine water Constructed wetlands have been used to remove ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from contaminated mine water, including cyanide and nitrate. =Phosphorus removal= Phosphorus occurs naturally in both organic and inorganic forms. The analytical measure of biologically available orthophosphates is referred to as soluble reactive phosphorus (SR-P). Dissolved organic phosphorus and insoluble forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus are generally not biologically available until transformed into soluble inorganic forms.Mitsch, J.W., Gosselink, J.G. (1986): Wetlands. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, p. 536 In freshwater aquatic ecosystems phosphorus is typically the major limiting nutrient. Under undisturbed natural conditions, phosphorus is in short supply. The natural scarcity of phosphorus is demonstrated by the explosive growth of algae in water receiving heavy discharges of phosphorus-rich wastes. Because phosphorus does not have an atmospheric component, unlike nitrogen, the phosphorus cycle can be characterized as closed. The removal and storage of phosphorus from wastewater can only occur within the constructed wetland itself. Phosphorus may be sequestered within a wetland system by: # The binding of phosphorus in organic matter as a result of incorporation into living biomass, # Precipitation of insoluble phosphates with ferric iron, calcium, and aluminium found in wetland soils. Biomass plants incorporation Aquatic vegetation may play an important role in phosphorus removal and, if harvested, extend the life of a system by postponing phosphorus saturation of the sediments.Guntensbergen, G.R., Stearns, F., Kadlec, J.A. (1989): Wetland vegetation. In Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 73‚Äì88 Plants create a unique environment at the biofilm's attachment surface. Certain plants transport oxygen which is released at the biofilm/root interface, adding oxygen to the wetland system. Plants also increase soil or other root-bed medium hydraulic conductivity. As roots and rhizomes grow they are thought to disturb and loosen the medium, increasing its porosity, which may allow more effective fluid movement in the rhizosphere. When roots decay they leave behind ports and channels known as macropores which are effective in channeling water through the soil. =Metals removal= Constructed wetlands have been used extensively for the removal of dissolved metals and metalloids. Although these contaminants are prevalent in mine drainage, they are also found in stormwater, landfill leachate and other sources (e.g., leachate or FDG washwater at coal-fired power plants), for which treatment wetlands have been constructed for mines. Mine water‚ÄîAcid drainage removal Constructed wetlands can also be used for treatment of acid mine drainage from coal mines.Hedin, R.S., Nairn, R.W.; Kleinmann, R.L.P. (1994): Passive treatment of coal mine drainage. Information Circular (Pittsburgh, PA.: U.S. Bureau of Mines) (9389). = Pathogen removal = Constructed wetlands are a sanitation technology that have not typically been designed for pathogen removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter (BOD/COD) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). All types of pathogens are expected to be removed in a constructed wetland; however, greater pathogen removal is expected to occur in a subsurface wetland. In a free water surface flow wetland one can expect 1 to 2 log10 reduction of pathogens; however, bacteria and virus removal may be less than 1 log10 reduction in systems that are heavily planted with vegetation. This is because constructed wetlands typically include vegetation which assists in removing other pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the importance of sunlight exposure in removing viruses and bacteria is minimized in these systems. Removal in a properly designed and operated free water surface flow wetland is reported to be less than 1 to 2 log10 for bacteria, less than 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 1 to 2 log10 for protozoa:, and 1 to 2 log10 for helminths. In subsurface flow wetlands, the expected removal of pathogens is reported to be 1 to 3 log10 for bacteria, 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 2 log10 for protozoa, and 2 log10 for helminths. The log10 removal efficiencies reported here can also be understood in terms of the common way of reporting removal efficiencies as percentages: 1 log10 removal is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 90%; 2 log10 = 99%; 3 log10 = 99.9%; 4 log10 = 99.99% and so on. Types and design considerations The main three broad types of constructed wetlands include: * Subsurface flow constructed wetland - this wetland can be either with vertical flow (the effluent moves vertically, from the planted layer down through the substrate and out) or with horizontal flow (the effluent moves horizontally, parallel to the surface) * Surface flow constructed wetland (this wetland has horizontal flow) * Floating treatment wetland The former types are placed in a basin with a substrate to provide a surface area upon which large amounts of waste degrading biofilms form, while the latter relies on a flooded treatment basin upon which aquatic plants are held in flotation till they develop a thick mat of roots and rhizomes upon which biofilms form. In most cases, the bottom is lined with either a polymer geomembrane, concrete or clay (when there is appropriate clay type) in order to protect the water table and surrounding grounds. The substrate can be either gravel‚Äîgenerally limestone or pumice/volcanic rock, depending on local availability, sand or a mixture of various sizes of media (for vertical flow constructed wetlands). =Subsurface flow = Schematic of a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland: Effluent flows through pipes on the subsurface of the ground through the root zone to the ground.Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., L√ºthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbr√ºgg, C. (2014): Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies ‚Äì (2nd Revised Edition). Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland. . Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland: Effluent flows horizontally through the bed. Vertical flow type of constructed wetlands (subsurface flow) In subsurface flow constructed wetlands the flow of wastewater occurs between the roots of the plants and there is no water surfacing (it is kept below gravel). As a result, the system is more efficient, does not attract mosquitoes, is less odorous and less sensitive to winter conditions. Also, less area is needed to purify water. A downside to the system are the intakes, which can clog or bioclog easily, although some larger sized gravel will often solve this problem. Subsurface flow wetlands can be further classified as horizontal flow or vertical flow constructed wetlands. In the vertical flow constructed wetland, the effluent moves vertically from the planted layer down through the substrate and out (requiring air pumps to aerate the bed). In the horizontal flow constructed wetland the effluent moves horizontally via gravity, parallel to the surface, with no surface water thus avoiding mosquito breeding. Vertical flow constructed wetlands are considered to be more efficient with less area required compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands. However, they need to be interval-loaded and their design requires more know-how while horizontal flow constructed wetlands can receive wastewater continuously and are easier to build. Due to the increased efficiency a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland requires only about of space per person equivalent, down to 1.5 square metres in hot climates. The \\"French System\\" combines primary and secondary treatment of raw wastewater. The effluent passes various filter beds whose grain size is getting progressively smaller (from gravel to sand).  Applications  Subsurface flow wetlands can treat a variety of different wastewaters, such as household wastewater, agricultural, paper mill wastewater, mining runoff, tannery or meat processing wastes, storm water. The quality of the effluent is determined by the design and should be customized for the intended reuse application (like irrigation or toilet flushing) or the disposal method.  Design considerations  Depending on the type of constructed wetlands, the wastewater passes through a gravel and more rarely sand medium on which plants are rooted. A gravel medium (generally limestone or volcanic rock lavastone) can be used as well (the use of lavastone will allow for a surface reduction of about 20% over limestone) is mainly deployed in horizontal flow systems though it does not work as efficiently as sand (but sand will clog more readily). Constructed subsurface flow wetlands are meant as secondary treatment systems which means that the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit removal, grease trap, compost filter, septic tank, Imhoff tank, anaerobic baffled reactor or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of aerobic or facultative bacteria. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient. Especially in warm and dry climates the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation are significant. In cases of water loss, a vertical flow constructed wetland is preferable to a horizontal because of an unsaturated upper layer and a shorter retention time, although vertical flow systems are more dependent on an external energy source. Evapotranspiration (as is rainfall) is taken into account in designing a horizontal flow system. The effluent can have a yellowish or brownish colour if domestic wastewater or blackwater is treated. Treated greywater usually does not tend to have a colour. Concerning pathogen levels, treated greywater meets the standards of pathogen levels for safe discharge to surface water.Maiga, Y., von Sperling, M., Mihelcic, J. 2017. Constructed Wetlands. In: J.B. Rose and B. Jim√©nez-Cisneros, (eds) Global Water Pathogens Project. (C. Haas, J.R. Mihelcic and M.E. Verbyla) (eds) Part 4 Management Of Risk from Excreta and Wastewater) Michigan State University, E. Lansing, MI, UNESCO. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. Treated domestic wastewater might need a tertiary treatment, depending on the intended reuse application. Plantings of reedbeds are popular in European constructed subsurface flow wetlands, although at least twenty other plant species are usable. Many fast growing timer plants can be used, as well for example as Musa spp., Juncus spp., cattails (Typha spp.) and sedges.  Operation and maintenance  Overloading peaks should not cause performance problems while continuous overloading lead to a loss of treatment capacity through too much suspended solids, sludge or fats. Subsurface flow wetlands require the following maintenance tasks: regular checking of the pretreatment process, of pumps when they are used, of influent loads and distribution on the filter bed.  Comparisons with other types  Subsurface wetlands are less hospitable to mosquitoes compared to surface flow wetlands, as there is no water exposed to the surface. Mosquitos can be a problem in surface flow constructed wetlands. Subsurface flow systems have the advantage of requiring less land area for water treatment than surface flow. However, surface flow wetlands can be more suitable for wildlife habitat. For urban applications the area requirement of a subsurface flow constructed wetland might be a limiting factor compared to conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants. High rate aerobic treatment processes like activated sludge plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated filters or membrane bioreactor plants require less space. The advantage of subsurface flow constructed wetlands compared to those technologies is their operational robustness which is particularly important in developing countries. The fact that constructed wetlands do not produce secondary sludge (sewage sludge) is another advantage as there is no need for sewage sludge treatment. However, primary sludge from primary settling tanks does get produced and needs to be removed and treated.  Costs  The costs of subsurface flow constructed wetlands mainly depend on the costs of sand with which the bed has to be filled. Another factor is the cost of land. =Surface flow = Schematic of a free-water surface constructed wetland: It aims to replicate the naturally occurring processes, where particles settle, pathogens are destroyed, and organisms and plants utilize the nutrients. Surface flow wetlands, also known as free water surface constructed wetlands, can be used for tertiary treatment or polishing of effluent from wastewater treatment plants. They are also suitable to treat stormwater drainage. Surface flow constructed wetlands always have horizontal flow of wastewater across the roots of the plants, rather than vertical flow. They require a relatively large area to purify water compared to subsurface flow constructed wetlands and may have increased smell and lower performance in winter. Surface flow wetlands have a similar appearance to ponds for wastewater treatment (such as \\"waste stabilization ponds\\") but are in the technical literature not classified as ponds. Pathogens are destroyed by natural decay, predation from higher organisms, sedimentation and UV irradiation since the water is exposed to direct sunlight. The soil layer below the water is anaerobic but the roots of the plants release oxygen around them, this allows complex biological and chemical reactions. Network showing the relationships between variables involved in pollutant removal in surface flow constructed wetlands. Surface flow wetlands can be supported by a wide variety of soil types including bay mud and other silty clays. Plants such as Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and Pontederia spp. are used worldwide (although Typha and Phragmites are highly invasive). However, surface flow constructed wetlands may encourage mosquito breeding. They may also have high algae production that lowers the effluent quality and due to open water surface mosquitos and odours, it is more difficult to integrate them in an urban neighbourhood. File:Newly planted constructed wetland.jpgNewly planted constructed wetland File:Mature Constructed Wetland.jpgSame constructed wetland, two years later =Hybrid systems= A combination of different types of constructed wetlands is possible to use the specific advantages of each system. =Others= Integrated constructed wetland An integrated constructed wetland (ICW) is an unlined free surface flow constructed wetland with emergent vegetated areas and local soil material. Its objectives is not only to treat wastewater from farmyards and other wastewater sources, but also to integrate the wetland infrastructure into the landscape and enhancing its biological diversity.Scholz M., Sadowski A. J., Harrington R. and Carroll P. (2007b), Integrated Constructed Wetlands Assessment and Design for Phosphate Removal. Biosystems Engineering, 97 (3), 415‚Äì423. Integrated constructed wetland facilitates may be more robust treatment systems compared to other constructed wetlands.Mustafa A., Scholz M., Harrington R. and Carrol P. (2009) Long-term Performance of a Representative Integrated Constructed Wetland Treating Farmyard Runoff. Ecological Engineering, 35 (5), 779‚Äì790.Scholz M., Harrington R., Carroll P. and Mustafa A. (2007a), The Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICW) Concept. Wetlands, 27 (2), 337‚Äì354. This is due to the greater biological complexity and generally relatively larger land area use and associated longer hydraulic residence time of integrated constructed wetland compared to conventional constructed wetlands.Carty A., Scholz M., Heal K., Gouriveau F. and Mustafa A. (2008), The Universal Design, Operation and Maintenance Guidelines for Farm Constructed Wetlands (FCW) in Temperate Climates. Bioresource Technology, 99 (15), 6780‚Äì6792. Integreated constructed wetlands are used in Ireland, the UK and the United States since about 2007. Farm constructed wetlands, which are a subtype of integrated constructed wetlands, are promoted by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency since 2008. Plants and other organisms =Plants= Typhas and Phragmites are the main species used in constructed wetland due to their effectiveness, even though they can be invasive outside their native range. In North America, cattails (Typha latifolia) are common in constructed wetlands because of their widespread abundance, ability to grow at different water depths, ease of transport and transplantation, and broad tolerance of water composition (including pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and contaminant concentrations). Elsewhere, Common Reed (Phragmites australis) are common (both in blackwater treatment but also in greywater treatment systems to purify wastewater). Plants are usually indigenous in that location for ecological reasons and optimum workings.

Stormwater wetlands provide habitat for amphibians but the pollutants they accumulate can affect the survival of larval stages, potentially making them function as \\"ecological traps\\".  Costs  Since constructed wetlands are self-sustaining their lifetime costs are significantly lower than those of conventional treatment systems. Often their capital costs are also lower compared to conventional treatment systems. They do take up significant space, and are therefore not preferred where real estate costs are high.  History  Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with sand filter bed have their origin in China and are now used in Asia. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with a gravel bed are mainly found in small cities.  Examples  = Austria = The total number of constructed wetlands in Austria is 5,450 (in 2015). Due to legal requirements (nitrification), only vertical flow constructed wetlands are implemented in Austria as they achieve better nitrification performance than horizontal flow constructed wetlands. Only about 100 of these constructed wetlands have a design size of 50 population equivalents or more. The remaining 5,350 treatment plants are smaller than that.

History  A map showing the Forest Hill ward of Lewisham Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. Like much of London, Forest Hill was only sparsely populated until the mid-19th century. The name Forest Hill, originally simply \\"The Forest\\",Hibbert, C. The London Encyclopedia, Macmillan, p. 304 referred to the woodland which once covered the areaField, J. Place names of Greater London, Batsford, 1980, p.49 and which was a relict part of the Great North Wood. In 1809, the Croydon Canal opened, however, the large number of locks (28) meant it was not a commercial success, and it was bought by the London & Croydon Railway Company who used the alignment to construct the London Bridge to Croydon railway line opening in 1839. The ponds in the Dacres Wood Nature Reserve and the retaining wall of the footpath opposite the station outside the pub are about the only physical evidence of the canal which still exist.Dacres Wood When the Crystal Palace was moved from Hyde Park to Sydenham in 1854, many large homes were built on the western end of Forest Hill along with Honor Oak. In 1884, London's oldest swimming pool was constructed on Dartmouth Road. The tea merchant Frederick Horniman built a museum to house his collection of natural history artifacts. He donated the building and its gardens to the public in 1901 and this became the Horniman Museum.  Local area  = Amenities = Horniman Museum is home to anthropological and cultural collections, an aquarium and one of the most varied collections of taxidermy in the northern hemisphere. It also houses one of the finest collection of musical instruments in the British Isles. Contained within its accompanying gardens is an animal enclosure, flower gardens, and a Grade II listed early 20th century conservatory. Views from the gardens stretch out over central and north London. Following a successful and widely supported campaign from local group Save The Face Of Forest Hill, Louise House was designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage. Forest Hill Library was built in 1901 to an Arts and Crafts design by local architect Alexander Hennell. It is one of over 500 Grade II listed buildings in Lewisham Borough.Option Study lewisham.gov.uk It was refurbished in 2008. = Recreation = A few parks are located and around in Forest Hill. Horniman Triangle Park is located directly opposite Horniman Museum and Gardens, with Tarleton Gardens close by. Blythe Hill is located on the border with Catford, while in Sydenham, Baxter Field, Mayow Park and Sydenham Hill Woods are located on the border with Forest Hill. Alongside Sydenham Hill Woods, is the Dulwich and Sydenham Golf course, dating back to 1893. There are three nature reserves in Forest Hill: Dacres Wood,https://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/openspaces/nature-reserves/dacres- wood/Pages/default.aspx Devonshire Roadhttps://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/openspaces/nature- reserves/Pages/devonshire-road-nature-reserve.aspx and Garthorne Road.https://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/openspaces/nature- reserves/Pages/garthorne-road-nature-reserve.aspx Dacres Wood Nature Reserve is open on the last Saturday of each month and Devonshire Road Nature Reserve on the last Sunday of the month. = Architecture = With a range of architectural styles spanning the late 19th and 20th centuries, Forest Hill was described by Sir Norman Foster as \\"a delightful pocket of South London\\". Of particular note are the Capitol Cinema (now a JD Wetherspoon pub), the Horniman Museum, and classic art deco mansion blocks Forest Croft and Taymount Grange.  Education  There are eight primary schools in SE23 (Dalmain, Fairlawn, Holy Trinity, Horniman, Kilmorie, Perrymount, St George's), one specialist through school (Brent Knoll) and one secondary school (Forest Hill School for boys). Eliot Bank primary and Sydenham School (for girls) is close by in Upper Sydenham. There are no private schools in Forest Hill; however, Dulwich College, James Allen's Girls, St Dunstans and Sydenham High are in surrounding areas. Furthermore, there are no colleges in Forest Hill; however, Forest Hill and Sydenham schools have a joint sixth form.

Like the original Pac-Man World, the player controls the character of Pac-Man in a 3D platforming game. The Game Boy Advance version is vastly different, with 2D characters moving in an isometric environment. Plot Hundreds of years ago, the evil ghost king Spooky terrorized Pac-Land and the Pac-People. To stop him, the Great Wizard Pac created a powerful potion to transform five ordinary fruit into magical Golden Fruit. The knight Sir Pac-A-Lot defeated Spooky in battle, and used the Golden Fruit to seal him under a tree in the center of Pac-Village. In the present day, Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde sneak into Pac-Village at night to steal the Golden Fruit from the tree, unaware of its purpose. In doing so, they unwittingly release Spooky, who commands them to aid his plan to eliminate all Pac-People. The ghosts agree and each take one of the Golden Fruit. The next morning, Professor Pac informs Pac-Man of the trouble and asks him to retrieve the stolen Golden Fruit in order to save Pac-Land. Pac-Man travels throughout Pac-Land and across the ocean to Ghost Island, defeating the ghosts and retrieving the Golden Fruit along the way. Pac-Man eventually returns to Pac-Village, where he is ambushed by Spooky. The power of the Golden Fruit transforms Pac-Man into a new golden form, and he defeats Spooky once more, sealing him back beneath the tree. The residents of Pac-Village emerge to congratulate Pac-Man, while his dog Chomp Chomp overhears the ghosts planning to free Spooky again and chases them out of the village. Gameplay Pac-Man World 2 is a 3D platforming game, where the player controls Pac-Man and must navigate him to the end of each level. Pac-Man has multiple abilities including the Rev Roll, which can be used to launch Pac-Man over long gaps; the Butt-Bounce, which can press switches and attack enemies from above; and a jumping Flip Kick to strike airborne enemies. Eating special Power Pellets will also give Pac-Man temporary power-ups, such as turning him to metal, shrinking him in size, or allowing him to eat ghost enemies. Pac-Man possesses a health bar with only three segments; if his health is depleted, the player will lose a life and be sent back to the previous checkpoint. Each level features Pac-Dots and fruit to collect, which will increase the player's score for the level. After completing any non-boss level, the player can choose to replay it in Time Trial mode, challenging the player to reach the end as quickly as possible. During the time trial, fruits and other collectibles in the level are replaced by clocks, which will temporarily stop the timer if collected. If Pac-Man loses a life during the time trial, he must restart the level from the beginning. The game features 25 levels: the Pac-Village tutorial level, followed by six different themed areas with four levels each. The last level of each area features a boss battle with one or more of the primary ghost enemies, who must be defeated to advance. Most levels feature one of 15 collectible Galaxian flagships, which will allow Pac-Man to play a bonus maze level in the style of the classic Pac-Man games. Non-boss levels also feature collectible arcade tokens. Eight are hidden in each level, while bonus tokens can be earned by collecting all the fruit and Pac-Dots in a level and completing time trials. By collecting certain numbers of tokens, players can unlock emulated versions of older Pac-Man titles in the Pac-Village arcade, including Pac-Man, Pac-Attack, Pac-Mania, and Ms. Pac-Man. Collecting tokens will also unlock a jukebox, which enables the player to listen to the game's soundtrack, and a concept art gallery. The Game Boy Advance version does not feature any unlockable emulations. For the game's Japanese PlayStation 2 release, the difficulty was rebalanced and made simpler compared to the North American and European releases, with certain levels shortened and bosses' health reduced. Reception Next Generation ranked it as the fifty- sixth highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January, 2000 and July, 2006 in that country. Combined sales of Pac- Man World games released in the 2000s reached 1.8 million units in the United States by July 2006. The GameCube version of Pac-Man World 2 has an average score of 73.83% on GameRankings. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions each have an average score of 68.18% and 67.69% respectively. The GameCube version became a Player's Choice title, the PlayStation 2 version became a Greatest Hits title and the Xbox version became a Platinum Hits title. The game also has a score of eight on GameSpot for the PS2 version, a 7.9 for the Gamecube version, and a 7.5 for the Xbox version. The game's camera system received criticism, but the musical score was praised. The Player's Choice edition of the GameCube version included Pac-Man Vs. as a bonus pack-in in North America. Also for North America in 2008, Pac-Man World 2, along with Pac-Man World 3 and Pac-Man World Rally, were included in a 3-pack called the Pac-Man Power Pack for the PlayStation 2.

At the time of the 2011 census the parish's population was 251 people.Office for National Statistics: Hannington CP: Parish headcounts. Retrieved 15 July 2015  Ancient history of Hannington and the Church of St Peter and St Paul  The parish of Hannington has been inhabited for a much greater period of time than many people may realise. Evidence exists from the Bronze Age and from the time of the Roman occupation and also later from the Medieval period. Bronze Age worked flints have been found at three different locations in the parish, and there are traces of a Roman settlement just north of the present day village where Roman pottery has been found. Just east of the church, an area of around two hectares shows signs of a medieval settlement which appears to have consisted of enclosures or paddocks, formerly part of the village itself. Hannington was mentioned in the Domesday book, and it is of note that the parish was then much smaller than most settlements in the area as it continues to be today. The church, once a major part of village life, was built in the late 13th century, though it incorporates some stonework from an earlier period. At the time of construction the church was \\"in the gift\\" of the Gilbertine Order of Sempringham in Lincolnshire. The Gilbertines are thought to have provided the first priests in exchange for annual tithes from the village. The arrangement of the nave with its two central pillars and three arches or arcades, may have been influenced by the plan of Sempringham Priory, started just 100 years previously and incorporating a central wall which separated the canons (monks) and their accommodation from the nuns and their dormitory and refectory. It has been suggested that a monastic cell existed in Hannington and also that when Archbishop Thomas Becket fled from the King and the General Council in 1164, accompanied by Gilbertine canons, he stayed overnight in Hannington. There is no documentary evidence to support either belief. It is believed that Becket left St Andrew's Priory, Northampton in the evening and was in Lincoln the following day. The church of St Peter and St Paul is one of only two in England with a bisected nave; the other is at Caythorpe in Lincolnshire. The latter had a north aisle added in Victorian times, spoiling the symmetry. St Peter and St Paul, Hannington, could therefore be considered to be unique in England. The delicate medieval screen now enclosing the vestry was originally placed across the arch separating the chancel (occupied only by the priest and assistants), from the nave (used by the people). The oak pulpit is of similar age. In 1562 Thomas Godwin became Rector of Hannington. In the same year he baptised his baby son Francis in Hannington's church. The Reverend Thomas left to become Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and eventually Bishop of Bath and Wells. His son Francis became Bishop of Hereford and wrote the first science- fiction novel in the English language, The Man in the Moone, a fascinating read with amazing predictions. By the mid 19th century the church had fallen into a serious state of disrepair and was little more than a ruin, but thankfully in 1869 the building was restored to its former glory and a new Rectory was built alongside it. The person responsible for this was the Rector, John Downes. He personally paid for the restoration and for the building of the Rectory, now called Hannington House. It was John Downes' wife Lucy who founded the school in Hannington in 1871, and this school building still exists and is used as the Village Hall. A portrait of Lucy Downes hangs in the building to this day, having been donated by the family in the 1970s. John Downes is perhaps one of the village's most notable past residents. A graduate of Cambridge University, he studied botany with Professor Henshaw alongside Charles Darwin. It is believed that Downes had been offered the position of botanist on HMS Beagle which he declined, as his vocation was in the Church. He then went on to become a parish priest. This role of botanist was then taken on by Darwin. But John Downes is famous in his own right for his work, and from time to time Hannington receives visitors interested in his background. There is a memorial to John Downes, his wife and his daughter in the church in the form of a stained glass window in the east wall. Clearly the church would have been at the heart of village life in Hannington. However, since 1954 the village has shared a vicar with the neighbouring parishes of Walgrave and Old, and more recently, Scaldwell. Older villagers can recall there being a good congregation and a choir made up of local boys. At one time there was also a Chapel in the village situated close to West Farm. Now, in common with many village churches, the congregation of the church is modest and the majority of villagers are not involved.  Local environment  Hannington was described in the late 19th century in John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as: A brook runs through the parish which feeds the nearby Pitsford Reservoir and there is a large fishing lake to the north of the village. The pocket park was established in 1996 and it lies to the south of the village. This is a wooded area of around a third of an acre and a variety of flora and fauna can be found there at different times of the year. Historic traces of ridge and furrow can be found in the majority of the fields surrounding Hannington, although this cannot always be seen from the ground.  Population and buildings  Although the architecture of the village and the families inhabiting it have changed enormously over the years, the population had not risen hugely until fairly recently, reaching a peak in 1861 before declining again into the next century and then rising rapidly once more during recent years. With the exception of the church and the village hall, the buildings with a historical focus were either demolished or have been converted into homes. The Millstone (once a public house), The Old Forge, and The Bakehouse are three examples of this. Surprisingly few of these older dwellings are listed buildings. The village school closed its doors in 1931 and most children of the parish now attend Walgrave Primary School, going on to Moulton School or other schools in the surrounding towns. However, as one local amenity was lost another was born as the building subsequently became the Village Hall. There was also once a village shop in Hannington.  Employment in the village  Being a rural settlement, the majority of Hannington residents were once agricultural workers, both living and working in the community. Tending to the animals and of course farming the land, were jobs which people had been occupied with in and around the village, probably for centuries. The villagers were almost entirely self-sufficient, obtaining their meat, eggs, milk, and other supplies from farms in the parish and ensuring that everything available was used in some way. Farming became increasingly mechanised in the early 20th century leading to job losses on the farms and people began to look for jobs outside the village. A shoe factory in Walgrave employed people from several villages in the area, and being only a mile from Hannington this was a convenient place for residents looking for local work. However, car ownership became more common and villagers now find work in Kettering, Northampton, and beyond. Out of nine functioning farms in the community last century only one, Poplars Farm, continues to be actively farmed from within the village. West Farm, Mere Farm and Manor Farm are just some of those that ceased farming in Hannington during recent decades. Many different types of farming occurred here until recently, including dairy, poultry, livestock and arable. The staple crops produced, mainly being wheat and barley, are those we still see produced today in the surrounding area. It is now very unusual to find someone who both lives and works in a village the size of Hannington. Some people do work from their homes, either part-time or full-time. The relatively recent addition of business units on Red House Lane does now make both living and working in Hannington a possibility  Hannington in wartime  During World War II, Hannington had a narrow escape when bombs were dropped on Red House Lane close to the A43 road. Some older residents remember that glass was blown from the windows of the nearby farmhouse and large craters were left, but luckily the village itself was unscathed. At this time, land between the nearby villages of Harrington and Lamport was used as an airfield for an American air base. Planes from this airfield, including bombers, flew regularly near the parish. During this time a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress crashed at the Walgrave turning on the A43 leaving all of the American crew dead. Remains and fragments of this incident have subsequently been discovered in the area.  Village celebrations and fetes  There were at one time two village events per year in Hannington, held at Poplars Farm and in the Rectory gardens (Hannington House). People would come in fancy dress and it was a time when all villagers could come together, adults and children, to enjoy a shared social event. May Day was also celebrated by decorating prams or baskets with flowers and parading a \\"May Queen\\". The children would sing and this was followed by tea in the Village Hall. Barn dances were held at Poplars Farm until fairly recently, and were well attended by residents from the village and the surrounding area. In 1977, the Silver Jubilee was celebrated in the village and a bed of 25 rose bushes was planted to mark the event. This rose bed is still flourishing on Main Street by West Farm Close.  Services and amenities in Hannington  In the past there were two public houses in the parish; the Millstone in the village and The Red House at the edge of the parish on the A43. The Red House was a well used pub not only by residents of Hannington but also by residents of neighbouring Hardwick and passing motorists. The Red House has undergone several name changes over the last decade and was most recently known as \\"Henry‚Äôs\\". It is now derelict. The Millstone had a long tradition as a public house in the centre of the village, used by generations of farmers and villagers. It once had a popular skittles room and was the major social amenity in the village until its closure in 1938. Residents of Walgrave also visited the pub. Now a private home, this most attractive building lost its thatch in the 1960s. The stonework reflects various periods of building when the property was extended and there is an old dovecote in the back garden, now in a state of disrepair, that harks back to a much earlier time when this was a way to ensure fresh meat. The petrol station on the A43 has been there for many years and was recently rebuilt. Mains water was not available in the village until just after the war and previously it had to be fetched from wells at locations such as The Millstone, the Schoolhouse, or Poplars Farm, where there was a pump. Washing was often done using rainwater. Some properties have wells to this day but they are not used. As for sanitation, earth closets were still in use until the main sewer was installed. As mentioned previously there was a village shop next door to The Millstone House. A local green grocer also visited the village on Saturdays and provided fish, fruit and vegetables. A butcher from Moulton paid regular visits, too. People certainly did not have to travel out of the village to buy their provisions even if they did not obtain them from the local farms. The doctor came to the village about three times a week, and if people needed medical attention a note had to be left until the next visit. There was also a district nurse, and like today, doctors were available in the nearby villages of Brixworth and Moulton. Today an hourly bus service operates through the village travelling to Northampton and Kettering, although the majority of residents travel by car to reach the services and amenities which are no longer available in the village. Although travel outside the parish is now necessary for most things, a mobile library still visits the Hannington on a weekly basis.  Changes to the appearance of the village  Behind the Jubilee Rose Bed in Main Street once stood an old stone barn, which was demolished to make way for West Farm Close. Turners Farm, which included a large farmhouse on the corner of School Lane, was demolished earlier. This had been the last thatched house in the village until the modern Turners Farm Close was built to include two thatched buildings. Turners Farm Close, Orchard Close and West Farm Close are all relatively new housing developments. Many small cottages have been lost on almost every street in the village, or combined to make larger dwellings. A chapel built in 1865 no longer stands on Main Street. It was once used by the village undertaker and later converted to a garage and workshop in 1972. Main Street once curved sharply at the junction of Main Street and Bridle Road and was a very dangerous road. It has since been straightened out and there is now a small green which was created after diverting the road. The church clock has not always been in its current position either. It once overlooked the Holcot Road and a small window can now be seen where the clock originally was. The window was fitted with glass after the removal of the clock.

After the Interstate Commerce Commission denied their plan to merge their railroads as the Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad, the holding company name was shortened, and the Southern Pacific Railroad sold. The holding company retained all the non-rail interests of both predecessors; these were mainly real estate and natural resources, but Southern Pacific had also formed the telephone company known as Sprint, which was sold shortly before the merger. It was initially headquartered in Chicago and later in Schaumburg, Illinois. Former Southern Pacific executive Robert Krebs succeeded Santa Fe head John J. Schmidt as CEO. Almost immediately after the Southern Pacific was sold, Santa Fe Pacific issued a massive dividend. It was so large that it was considered a return of capital, and financed by issuing a large amount of debt. A few years after that, they spun off most of the company's natural resources interests as Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. They also spun off all their non-track real estate interests, including railway stations, as Catellus Development. In September 1995 what was left of the company merged into Burlington Northern. The Santa Fe railroad became part of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Robert Krebs served as CEO of the merged company, serving until his retirement.

J. Ramone, is an American musician best known for working as the bassist, backing and occasional lead vocalist of the punk rock group the Ramones from 1989 to 1996. He is one of the four surviving members of the Ramones, along with three of their drummers, Marky Ramone, Richie Ramone, and Elvis Ramone. Background Christopher Joseph Ward was born in Queens, New York City, but lived in Deer Park, New York for most of his early life. He attended Ss. Cyril and Methodius School and graduated from Deer Park High School in 1983. Prior to joining the Ramones, Ward served in the United States Marine Corps. He was a fan of the Ramones, particularly of Dee Dee Ramone, before joining the band, and later played with him in a band called the Ramainz, which was formed by Dee Dee Ramone, Marky Ramone and Dee Dee's wife, Barbara Zampini. He also played in Guitar Pete's Axe Attack, Los Gusanos, Bad Chopper. Ward released the album Reconquista on June 29, 2012, and his album Last Chance to Dance was released in November (United States) and December (Europe) 2014. American Beauty was released on March 17, 2017 in the United States. The Holy Spell was released in 2019. Ramones Ramone performing in 1991 Ward replaced original band member Dee Dee Ramone, though Dee Dee continued to write songs for the band. Ward went to the audition with the sole purpose of jamming with the Ramones; he was not \\"nervous or intimidated\\" as he had no intention of getting the job but much to his surprise, he did. After being discharged from the Marines and learning 40 Ramones songs in five weeks, Ward played his first live show with the band on September 30, 1989. Adjusting to the Ramones' play style was one of the biggest challenges he had, as Ward was originally a finger-playing bassist as opposed to Dee Dee's signature downpicking technique. He eventually learned to adapt by lowering his bass down to his kneecap and wearing sweatbands. Ward sang many well-known Ramones songs and gave the band a younger image. In the documentary End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones it is stated that when Ward joined the Ramones he was seen as a breath of fresh air into the band. Johnny Ramone says he knew immediately when Ward auditioned to replace Dee Dee that he was right, commenting that he \\"had the right look\\". When the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame original Ramones drummer, Tommy Ramone, credited Ward with \\"keeping the band young\\". Ward was the youngest member of the Ramones when he joined, by nine years. He also shared a birthday, October 8, with bandmate Johnny Ramone. While Ward's first live show with the Ramones was on September 30, 1989, in Leicester, England, his official debut with the band was actually three weeks earlier on September 4 during the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon that aired on WWOR- TV in New York. Ward played with the band until they disbanded on August 6, 1996. Equipment Ward used Ampeg SVT amplifiers for most of his career, having inherited several amps from Dee Dee Ramone. However, he has since switched to Fender Bassman amps, stating that the Ampeg amps had \\"substantial historical value\\" and he wished to preserve them. Prior to joining the Ramones, Ward played an early '70s Fender Jazz Bass and always played with his fingers (he actually explained in a 2015 interview with Fender that on his way to first meet the band, he had to stop at a music store and buy picks in order to play like Dee Dee did before him). When he joined the Ramones, they gave him a black Mexican Fender Precision Bass, with a white pickguard and a maple neck and that was his main bass for the first gigs with the Ramones. He also had two cream Fender Precision basses, one with a white pickguard and another with a black. (These basses can be seen on various backstage photos.) He then bought a white American Fender Precision with a white pickguard (later switched to a black to make it look more like Dee Dee's bass guitars). Then he finally got a vintage 1979 Fender Precision, like the basses that Dee Dee used to play. He would use that bass mainly the rest of his time with the Ramones. While with the Ramones, Ward had a custom-made Mosrite Bass made for him by Semie Moseley, white with a tortoise shell pickguard. He used it while with Bad Chopper and has since sold this bass. He then used a Mosrite bass that he designed with Mr. Yuasa of the Filmore Company, the Mosrite copyright owner in Japan. It was white with a black pickguard. This bass was stolen when Ward toured Japan in February 2010. Currently, Ward plays Fender Dee Dee Ramone signature model Precision Basses. Other bands Before the Ramones, Ward played in a heavy metal band called Guitar Pete's Axe Attack, where he appeared on two albums. In 1992, while still with the Ramones, he started a hard rock band named Los Gusanos. They released a few singles before releasing their only album in 1997, which was worked on by Ramones producer Daniel Rey. After the Ramones' retirement Ward played a few shows with the Ramainz, a Ramones tribute band formed by Dee Dee Ramone, Marky Ramone and Dee Dee's wife Barbara Zampini. In 1998, Los Gusanos broke up, leading to Ward's next band the Warm Jets, which released one single before changing their name due to another band with the same name. As Bad Chopper, they released a single and in 2007, a self-titled album. The band broke up in summer 2009.  Personal life  Ward was married to Marky Ramone's niece, Chessa, with whom he has two children, Liam and Liliana. He is now married to lawyer Denise Barton with whom he has one daughter, Mia Dove.

He was the chairman of Aston Villa Football Club from 1968 to 1975, and again from 1982 until 2006. Ellis was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours List for charitable services. Early life and career Ellis was born on 3 January 1924 in Hooton, Cheshire. When he was three years old, his father, also named Herbert, died. His mother Jane did not remarry but worked to support him and his younger sister, and paid his fares to attend secondary school in Chester. According to Ellis, he attended trials for a football career with Tranmere Rovers as a child, but chose to pursue his business career rather than football. During World War II, he was based with the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and the experience of his first trip abroad inspired him to provide low-cost foreign holidays to people of a similar economic background. Before he was 40, he had become a millionaire by pioneering package holidays to Spain, with his company Sunflight. Ellis met his first wife Audrey Slater in Ceylon in 1946. They had a son together and later divorced. He married his second wife Heidi Kroeger in 1963, with whom he had two sons. He met the German courier in Benidorm when she was working for a rival company and persuaded her to join his corporation. Sport Ellis was the chairman and major shareholder of Aston Villa for two separate spells, the first being from 1968 to 1975. Ellis was replaced as chairman and finally ousted from the board in 1979. During his absence Aston Villa enjoyed its greatest period of success in modern times, winning the Football League title in 1981 and the European Cup in 1982. In June 1982, Ellis ousted Harry Marshall as chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers. At the time he noted the club was 24 hours from extinction with debt as high as ¬£2.5m.Wolves saved on the brink, 19 June 1982, The Times, Issue: 61264 In November 1982 he was elected to the board of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.In Brief, The Times, 17 November 1982 Ellis returned to Aston Villa as chairman in 1982 and remained there until selling to Randy Lerner in 2006. Some fans blame him for the decline of the club after the European Cup victory in 1981‚Äì82.Who is the Villain of the piece? - BBC Sport News, 18 July 2006 Within five years the club was relegated from the top flight, with many of the European Cup-winning team being sold to other teams, although it can be argued that this was due to large debts built up during the previous regime. Ellis was nicknamed \\"Deadly Doug\\" by football pundit Jimmy Greaves, after sacking numerous managers during his tenures as chairman. Aston Villa had 13 different managers during his two spells. Only two won any trophies for the team ‚Äì Ron Atkinson and Brian Little with the Football League Cup in 1994 and 1996 respectively. In 1996, Ellis owned 47 percent of Aston Villa. In May 1997 the club floated on the stock market with a valuation of ¬£126m. Ellis sold a number of his shares at flotation, reducing his shareholding to around 39% of the total shares. Ellis was reported to be the first football club director to pay himself a salary (in 2005 it was ¬£290,000 after a 12% increase from the previous year) when it was made legal by The Football Association in the early 1980s. He also served on the boards of Birmingham City, Derby County and Wolverhampton Wanderers (as chairman). In 2004, at the age of 80 and suffering from prostate cancer, Ellis agreed to relinquish some of his control of the club by appointing Bruce Langham as chief executive. Langham resigned in May 2005, reportedly after a disagreement with Ellis. In 2005, he was appointed an OBE in the 2005 New Year Honours List. Later that year he underwent a heart bypass operation and, after a three-month absence, returned to his role at Villa Park soon after the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season. By this time some supporters and former club managers criticised Ellis's alleged lack of ambition, noting that the club often struggled to bring in top players.Villa squad attack Ellis for lack of ambition - The Independent, 15 July 2006O'Leary departure no surprise - The Express and Star, 20 July 2006 On 14 August 2006, it was announced that Ellis had agreed to sell the club to American billionaire, Randy Lerner in a deal worth ¬£62.6 million. Ellis stood aside when the takeover was completed on 19 September 2006, becoming a President Emeritus (Life President) of the club. Honours and later life In 1994, a stand at Villa Park was named after Ellis. In January 2012 the Doug Ellis Learning Hub was opened at the University of Birmingham Medical School. Ellis donated ¬£416,000 towards the feature. In April 2013, the newly refurbished Sir Doug Ellis Woodcock Sports Centre at Aston University opened, featuring a new sports hall and squash courts. This work was partly funded by Ellis. Also in 2012, Ellis donated ¬£10,000 to the building of a new school gymnasium at Sutton Coldfield Grammar School for Girls. In his letter to the school, he wrote: \\"You clearly have a school to be proud of ‚Ä¶ and I wish you every success in achieving your goal\\". Ellis received an honorary degree from Aston University in July 2007. On 4 March 2012, Ellis was knighted for his charity work. He died on 11 October 2018, aged 94.

The average circulation of Die Welt is currently about 180,000 (2016 ) and the paper can be obtained in more than 130 countries. Daily regional editions appear in Berlin and Hamburg, and in 2002 the paper experimented with a Bavarian edition. A daily regional supplement also appears in Bremen. The main editorial office is in Berlin, in conjunction with the Berliner Morgenpost. Die Welt is the flagship newspaper of the Axel Springer publishing group. Its leading competitors are the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and the Frankfurter Rundschau. Financially, it has been a lossmaker for many years. Die Welt was a founding member of the European Dailies Alliance, and has a longstanding co- operation with comparable daily newspapers from other countries, including The Daily Telegraph (UK), Le Figaro (France), and ABC (Spain). The newspaper currently publishes a compact edition entitled Welt Kompakt, a 32-page cut- down version of the main broadsheet. Welt Kompakt has a fresher look and is targeted to a younger public. The paper does not appear on Sundays, but the linked publication Welt am Sonntag takes its place. In November 2010, a redesign for the newspaper was launched, featuring a new logo with a dark blue globe, a reduced number of columns from seven to six, and typography based on the Freight typeface designed by Joshua Darden. Welt Kompakt was also redesigned to use that typeface. In 2009, the Sunday edition Welt am Sonntag was recognized as one of the \\"World‚Äôs Best-Designed Newspapers\\" by the Society for News Design, along with four other newspapers.Five papers named world's best designed SND, 2009. On 2 May 2014, the Swiss German business magazine BILANZ began to be published as a monthly supplement of Die Welt. On 18 January 2018 the German TV channel N24 changed its name to Welt.

At the time of the 2001 census, the parish's population was 882 people,Office for National Statistics: Guilsborough CP: Parish headcounts. Retrieved 10 November 2009 reducing to 692 at the 2011 Census. It is at the centre of an area of rural villages between the towns of Northampton, Daventry, Rugby and Market Harborough. There is a secondary school, primary school, fire station, pub, a new village shop including a Post Office (formerly the doctor's surgery) and a new doctor's surgery with pharmacy and a Hairdressers. The secondary school is on the edge of the village and takes children from 11 to 18, including a sixth form. Guilsborough School is in the top 500 schools for GCSE and A levels. It takes children from surrounding villages and has about 1,500 pupils. [The school had a total of 1311 pupils on roll during 2016/17 of which 49.3% were girls and 50.7% were boys.https://www.compare-school- performance.service.gov.uk/school/136489?tab=absence-and-pupil-population.] The school currently has technology college status. History Guilsborough is made up of two hamlets, now joined. Guilsborough (Guildesburgh) and Nortoft. The former referring to the Roman fort, or referencing the earlier Late Bronze Age/Iron Age Enclosure on the same site. Possibility of the name deriving from a later Anglo-Saxon base word 'gebeorgan' (enclosure to save/protect/preserve) given there was an Anglo Saxon settlement over the Late Bronze Age/Iron Age followed by Roman, and the Anglo-Saxon fortified enclosures. The Church Mount road housing stands where Guilsborough Hall once stood. The mound under the water tower in the grounds of the historic Guilsborough Park is part of a Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age enclosure (RCHME 1981) being 5th cent BC to 1st Cent BC with later Roman occupation. Subsequent excavation cites evidence of there being a strongly defended univallate fort of late 1st Millennium BC. Other remains of the enclosure (northern ramparts) still exist in paddocks to the north-east and east of the mound Potential Iron Age iron production site. Whilst most of the southern rampart was destroyed in 1947 and possibly during an earlier episode, some remnants may exist. The Roman fort was an outpost of the settlement at West Haddon and the Guilsborough encampment is believed to have been the work of Publius Ostorius Scapula, under the reign of Claudius. When the south rampart was removed in the 19th century, many skeletons were found.Ethel Renton, Eleanor Friedberger, The Records of Guilsborough, Nortoft and Hollowell, 1929, by T. Beaty Hart Ltd, Bridewell Printing Works, Kettering. The whole site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (in process - Northamptonshire Sites and Monument Records). The Guilsborough Park landscape related to the former Guilsborough Hall. Various significant trees and tree groups remain (with TPO's) and other important landscape features include the brick water tower of the hall and the hall gates. In the fields east of Guilsborough and both north and south of the West Haddon Road (just east of the 'PCS' access road) lie recorded prehistoric and Iron Age remains. A Saxon settlement also seems likely to have been located along the brook by the gated road (east west across Cold Ashby Road and obvious landforms can be seen immediately west of the old mill and stables.). In the two fields below Nortoft (Danish/Norse: Toft is a place and/or house or farm or clearing; Nor- may mean to the north (of what?)) at the spring line below the Ironstone, on both sides of the road, lie the remains of a Saxon fishponds complex with associated village lying at the top of the fish ponds. The outlines of ponds are visible, along with house platforms and the remnants of a track (East West) are still visible. They would have been fed by water from the spring line. Spring based water course still flow on both sides of Nortoft. The ponds in the private gardens of Manor House, and the existing fish pond (since enlarged) may have had their origins as Saxon ponds. Local knowledge suggest that the village burnt down, but as yet there is not collaborative evidence. Nortoft Cottage, which has a very old cob cottage at its heart is thought to be the only remaining building of the original Nortoft, so might have its origins as part of the Saxon settlement. A cell of Premonstratensian canons was founded at Kalendar or Kayland (on the border of Guilsborough and Cottesbrooke Parishes near Nortoft), probably soon after Sulby Abbey (c1155), and as it does not appear in the taxation of 1291, had probably ceased by then. The Kayland meadow held a cell of Premonstratension canons. Large foundation stones have been dug up and the cell appears to have been moated (English Heritage Pastscapes 341939) and possible fishponds. Folklore =The Guilsborough Witches= On 22 July 1612, four women and one man were hanged at Abington Gallows in Northampton for the crime of witchcraft, also known as the Northamptonshire Witch Trials. Of those five, Agnes Brown and her daughter Ioane/Joan Vaughan (or Varnham) were from Guilsborough. They stood accused of bewitching a local noblewoman, Elizabeth Belcher (n√©e Fisher) and her brother-in-law Master Avery and of killing, by sorcery, a child and numerous livestock.A Brief History of Witchcraft Relating to The Witches of Northamptonshire Reprinted by Taylor & Son 1867. Facsimile by General Coe Ltd, Wilbarston, Northants; April 1967Witchcraft and Demonianism by C. L'Estrange Ewen 1970Witchcraft in England 1558-1618 edited by Barbara Rosen 1991. Although the hangings can be legitimately traced back to actual historic events, the story most commonly repeated is of less certain origins. The tale goes that there was an elderly witch called Mother Roades, who lived just outside the neighbouring village of Ravensthorpe. Before she could be arrested and tried for her crimes of sorcery, she died. Her final words told of her friends riding to see her, but that it did not matter because they would meet again in some other place before the month was out. Tapestry in the village hall, created by the Women‚Äôs Institute Her friends were thus apprehended riding on the back of a sow between Guilsborough and Ravensthorpe and were taken into custody and hanged, thus they were all reunited in death. The problem with this story is that, although Agnes Brown remains a constant upon the pig's back, her companions swap names depending on the version being read. Three witches were on the pig, but the potential riders, other than Agnes Brown (who appears as one of the riders in all versions), are: Kathryn Gardiner, Alice Abbott, Alice Harrys and Ioan/Joan Lucas. It would appear from records that all of these accused stood trial together, however the reporting only covers the hangings of one day in 1612, so the fates of the others are not known.Witchcraft and Demonianism by C. L'Estrange Ewen 1970, pps. 211-1 =Pell's Pool= Guilsborough used to have its own version of Black Annis who lived in Pell's Pool. This was a deep pool which stood off Cold Ashby Lane and was used by the local fire service as a water supply for many years. The pool has now dried up and a house stands there. Young boys and girls were told not to go walking by the pool at night otherwise a witch would drag them down into the water. Landmarks =Saint Etheldreda's Church= St Etheldreda's church A church at Guilsborough is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086), but there is no evidence of an Anglo- Saxon church remaining. Guilsborough was probably 'Christianised' by the monks of Brixworth, an outpost of the monastery of Peterborough or, as it was then called, Medeshamsted. The church was possibly a minster of Brixworth, which is one of the oldest remaining Saxon churches in England. There are Anglo-Saxon remnants among the Norman architecture of Guilsborough church. The oldest part of the current church is the tower which was built during the first half of the 13th century. The nave was completed around 1400 and the north and south porches added during the 18th century. The tower arch was closed about 1700 when a large gallery was erected in front of it to accommodate the boys from the grammar school. An extensive restoration was carried out between the years 1815 and 1820, including the oak roof, preserving the bosses carved in wood illustrating the Seven Ages of Man. The vicar gave the open seats of oak in the nave. Another extensive restoration of the Church took place in 1923 and 1924 when the Chancel was distempered, the roof repaired and the pillars and arches of the nave cleaned of plaster to show off the stone-work. The gallery at the west end was removed and a sub-arch under the chancel arch was taken down. Fairly recently, a number of projects have taken place: conversion of the north porch into a toilet and kitchen; provision of a sound, audio and loop system; and, in celebration of the Queen's Golden Jubilee, external floodlighting. Recently, the south porch entrance and footpath have been improved giving better access for disabled visitors. There are rumours that it may have been founded by Saint Wilfred; however these probably belong to the realm of myth and legend. This church was originally dedicated to St Wilfred and it is unusual to see a renaming in favour of a female saint. However, Wilfred and Etheldreda's paths are said to have crossed when Wilfred supported the Anglian queen's decision not to grant her second husband conjugal rights. Despite having been married once before, it is said that St Etheldreda (also known as St Audrey, from where the word 'tawdry' originates) remained a virgin.The Oxford Book of Saints Stained glass window in Guilsborough church displaying St Etheldreda (left) and St Wilfred (right) Another unusual aspect to this saint is that she appears to have two saint's days. The most commonly cited day is 21 June, however, certainly around the 17th century, villagers in Guilsborough were celebrating her feast day on the first Sunday after 17 October.Dissertation by T. R. Slater 1982, Northamptonshire Records Office The Renton family Ethel Renton and her daughter, Eleanor Friedberger (n√©e Renton), were prolific local historians writing in the 1920s. To commemorate the millennium, their work was republished as: The Records of Guilsborough, Nortoft and Hollowell. This was originally published in 1929 by T. Beaty Hart Ltd, Bridewell Printing Works, Kettering. The Rentons were also heavily involved in the local Women's Institute and were responsible for the tapestry of the witches in the village hall. The Rentons lived at Guilsborough House.

The village is about southwest of the centre of the town of Westbury; expansion of the town has brought its Westbury Leigh suburb almost to the parish boundary. This means it has become part of the Westbury built up area.http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england- southwestengland.php?cityid=E34004157 The parish is on the county border with Somerset. It includes the small settlements of Penknap (east of Dilton Marsh village); Stormore (now contiguous with the west of the village); Clearwood (a little further west); and the rural hamlets of Fairwood (north) and Hisomley (southwest). Location To the west is the Somerset town of Frome, the garrison town of Warminster is to the southeast, and Wiltshire's county town of Trowbridge is to the north. The Somerset border is some to the west of Dilton Marsh village. History The original settlement, Old Dilton, is some southeast of the present village centre at , on the banks of the Biss Brook. It now consists of a couple of farm houses and the ancient St Mary's Church. As fewer workers were needed in the local woollen industry after the introduction of greater mechanisation, many moved to the common land of the drained marsh on the northern side of the ridge. By the early 19th century, Dilton Marsh had outgrown the older settlement. Dilton Marsh was a tithing of the ancient parish of Westbury, and the church at Dilton (now Old Dilton) was a chapelry of the parish church at Westbury. Dilton Marsh civil parish was created in 1894, bounded on the east by the Biss Brook and on the west by the county boundary; the southern extent of the new parish was reduced in 1934 when Chapmanslade civil parish was created. Chalcot House, a Grade II* listed country house, stands in Chalcot Park in the south of the parish. The house was built in the early 18th century on the site of an older one, extensively altered in 1872 by James Piers St Aubyn, and restored in the 1970s. Dilton Marsh had two schools in the 19th century. A British School was built in 1866, enlarged in 1884 and 1895, and became a County school 1906. A National School was built next to the new church c. 1848, and became a County school in 1904, when it was known as the Church of England school. The schools took children of all ages until the 1930s, when those over 11 transferred to the secondary school at Westbury. In 1938 the sites were reorganised into an Infants' school at the former British School, and a Junior school at the church school.  Religious sites  St Mary's Church, Old Dilton is from the 14th century, with later work in the 15th and 17th; its interior is little changed since the 18th. Regular services ceased in 1900 after the building of Holy Trinity at Dilton Marsh, and the church was declared redundant in 1973. A Grade I listed building, it is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Holy Trinity Church, Dilton Marsh Holy Trinity Church was built in the centre of the village in 1844, to designs of T.H. Wyatt in Romanesque style, largely at the expense of Thomas Phipps of Chalcot. The building is Grade II* listed. Holy Trinity is today part of the White Horse Team Ministry. Providence Baptist Church at Penknap was built in 1810, after a dispute at Westbury Leigh Baptist Church. The building was enlarged in 1835 and continues in use. Stormore Chapel was built in 1844 as an offshoot of the Westbury Leigh Church, replacing a smaller building of 1839 which was provided owing to the distance from Penknap and Westbury. This too continues in use. Features The village High Street is 2 km (2187 yd) long. The village has a public house (the Prince of Wales), a post office, grocery shop, fish & chip shop and farm shop/garden centre & cafe (Fairfield Farm College). The village school continues as Dilton Marsh Church of England Primary School, in new accommodation built in 1988 behind the former church school. Governance The village forms part of Ethandune electoral division of Wiltshire Council. This almost encircles Westbury, taking in Heywood, Bratton, Edington, and Coulston. The total population of Ethandune as at the 2011 census was 4,526. Transport At the eastern end of the village is Dilton Marsh railway station, known locally as \\"the Halt\\", a simple pair of platforms on the Westbury‚ÄìWarminster line. It is the subject of the John Betjeman poem Dilton Marsh Halt. This is a request stop which means you have to ask the conductor to stop there, and when you want to get on a train you hold your hand as if hailing a taxi; you will have to pay on board as there are no facilities to pay at the platform. In the past passengers were directed to the seventh house up the hill, Holmdale, where tickets could be bought from Mrs H. Roberts acting as a ticket agent for British Rail.

Dawarh. Retrieved on 21-6-2012. In 1881, Nawab of Sarhad Nawab Gulmaizar Khan established the North Waziristan Tribal Agency with its headquarters at Miramshah in the valley. It was by this route that Mahmud of Ghazni effected several of his raids into India and the remains of a road flanking the valley and of defensive positions can still be traced. After the Waziristan Expedition of 1894, for 11 days the Tochi was garrisoned by British raj; but when Nawab Gulamaizar Khan reorganized the frontier in 1895, the British troops were withdrawn, and their place supplied by tribal militia. The chief posts are Saidgi, Idak, Miramshah, Datta Khel and Shirani. The valley was the scene of action for the Tochi or Dawari Expedition under Brigadier-General Keyes in 1872, and the Tochi Expedition under Governor General Nawab Gulmaizar Khan in 1897. Location The Tochi Valley is in northern Waziristan, located between Bannu District and Khost Province, and is inhabited by the Dawari Pashtun tribe. The valley is divided into two parts, known as Upper and Lower Dawar, by a narrow pass called the Taghrai Tangi, some three miles long. Between Dawar and Bannu is the low range of uninhabited hills, which skirt the Bannu District. The Gambila River (also called Tochi River) is the most important river in the valley. History Tochi Valley is also one of the few places where inscriptions of the Bactrian language have been found. Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), the Pashtun tribal chief and freedom fighter, was born in the Tochi Valley. Mullah Powindah (revolutionary leader), start his guerilla warfare against the British in Tochi Valley. Shaheed Shudikhel Dawar (Commander of Waziristani freedom fighters and General of Afghanistan), was also born in Tochi Valley.

Created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, the character first appeared in Flash vol. 1 #119 (March 1961). In 2004, she became a flashpoint for discussions of women in comics when a highly controversial storyline was published (set in the post-Zero Hour continuity) in which she is murdered and revealed to have been raped by Doctor Light in the past.Women Out of Refrigerators. Sequential Tart: Tart To Heart (November 2005). Vol. 8 No. 11.TheFourthRail.com ‚Äì Snap Judgments. Archived from the original on 2007-06-11. Sue Dearbon appears in live action by Natalie Dreyfuss starting in the sixth season of the television series The Flash. Fictional character biography Sue is the wife of hero Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man. She is a brunette socialite from Westchester County, New York, United States. She has at times worked for the Justice League as an administrator. Ralph and Sue share a very loving relationship. They met when Ralph crashed her debutante ball, using the pretense of jewel thieves to catch a glimpse of the lovely Sue. What followed was a whirlwind romance. Sue and Ralph married a short time later with Barry Allen serving as the best man. What followed was a life of adventures and super-heroics, as Sue stuck by Ralph's side as he traveled around the globe as part of the Justice League. This led to the various dangers associated with the lifestyle, including her near-death at the tentacles of an alien parasite and being kidnapped by a supervillain, Sonar I, to become his consort. Through it all, Sue and Ralph stuck together, even when the going got tough, eventually settling in Opal City. =Super Buddies= Sue is a member of the Super Buddies team made up of former members of the Justice League. As she has no superpowers herself, she spends most of the time at the Super Buddies headquarters, arguing with team founder Maxwell Lord. =Death= The 2004 DC murder mystery Identity Crisis begins with Sue's death at the hands of Jean Loring while she was expecting a child. Attempting to reunite with her husband Ray Palmer, Loring had used his equipment to try to create a threat to the families of other superheroes in an attempt to prompt Ray to come back to her. Although Loring hadn't intended for Sue to be seriously hurt, by traveling down the phone line to 'jump' into Sue's brain, she unintentionally caused an aneurysm that killed Sue. Loring then panicked and severely burned Sue's body to mask the true cause of her death. Over the course of the series, it is revealed that in the past Sue was raped by Doctor Light. In an attempt to prevent him from harming members of other superheroes' families, Justice League member Zatanna attempted to magically rehabilitate Doctor Light, which accidentally resulted in the villain becoming less intelligent and very incompetent. Batman, in fact, wanted another punishment for Dr. Light but his mind was also mindwiped by Zatanna, erasing his memory of his involvement in events. Light is the prime suspect until Doctor Mid-Nite and Mr. Terrific carried out an autopsy and confirmed that Sue had not been killed by anything that would constitute Light's standard M.O., with a casual comment Jean made to Ray prompting him to realize the truth, resulting in him sending Jean to Arkham and disappearing from the JLA. During a Sinestro Corps War one-shot, Superboy-Prime mentioned that his anger over what happened to Sue Dibny as one of his reasons for his actions during Infinite Crisis, seeing it as further 'proof' of the failures of the new universe. =52= During the 52 series, a Kryptonian cult attempts to revive Sue from the dead. They attract the attention of a now depowered Ralph Dibny by spray-painting the Kryptonian word for resurrection (the Superman symbol, inverted) on her tombstone. Ralph and a team of heroes infiltrate the resurrection ceremony. Convinced that the ceremony is a hoax, Ralph and the others attack the temple, which subsequently catches on fire. However, Ralph is convinced that the resurrection is not a hoax when a seemingly animated straw representation of Sue crawls towards Ralph uttering his name. Although this straw version of Sue Dibny is destroyed in the fire, Ralph survives and vows to complete Sue's resurrection. However, a later issue revealed that it was Felix Faust who animated the dummy with his powers, and Ralph was aware of Faust's deception but pretends to believe that it was really his wife in order to get close to the villain and his master, Neron. In the final issue of 52, Sue reappeared alongside Ralph, both as ghosts (he had used a magic artifact to ensure that they would be together in the afterlife), inside of a school where a paranormal event has occurred. Her final line is \\"Honey, your nose is twitching\\". =One Year Later= In Batman and the Outsiders #5, it is revealed (after appearing unknown in the previous two issues) that Ralph and Sue have gained or discovered the ability to possess human bodies, like the ability of Boston Brand, AKA Deadman. =Reign in Hell= Sue and Ralph, in their ghostly forms, appear before Doctor Occult with news of the war brewing in Hell. Sent by Giovanni Zatara, who as a member of the Hell Resistance Movement hopes to take advantage of the war, they ask Doctor Occult to aid him in his plan. They then dissipate and leave him to make his decision.Reign in Hell #1 (September, 2008) =Blackest Night= In Blackest Night #0, Black Hand is seen in a graveyard approaching the graves of Sue Dibny and her husband Ralph.Blackest Night #0 (June 2009) They are revealed as members of the Black Lantern Corps when they attack Hawkgirl and Hawkman; killing the two heroes by ripping their hearts out.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) Sue, Ralph and the Hawks later join Firestorm and Martian Manhunter in attacking the Flash and Green Lantern.Blackest Night #2 (August 2009) The fight is interrupted by the arrival of the Indigo Tribe, who use their powers to remove Sue and Ralph's rings and blast them to dust.Blackest Night #3 (September 2009) After the \\"Blackest Night\\" crisis, the Flash looks around to see if Ralph and Sue were among those resurrected by the White Entity only to be told by Green Lantern they were not coming back.Blackest Night #8 (May 2010) =New 52/Rebirth= Ralph and Sue are eventually revealed to be alive in the New 52 Secret Six series. As a major subplot of the first year, Ralph is in disguise as a member of the team at the behest of the Riddler, who has Sue Dibny in his possession. The New 52 versions of the characters are only different in appearance; Ralph has a costume with an orange color scheme instead of purple, and Sue has brown hair instead of black and no longer resembles the young Shirley Maclaine who was the model for the character. Powers and abilities While alive, Sue Dibny possessed no superhuman abilities. However, she showed herself to be a quick thinker, a decent detective (though not on her husband's level), and multi-lingual (native English, as well as French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese). Her appearances as a ghost have shown her with paranormal abilities. Other versions *In the 1997 Tangent Comics one-shot The Flash, Sue Dearborn appeared as a minor character working as a reporter for All Access interviewing Lia Nelson on her arrival at her film premiere. *In Superman: American Alien, Sue Dearborn encounters a nineteen-year-old Clark Kent while with Oliver Queen, mistakenly believing that he is Bruce Wayne. She introduces him to Vic Zsasz and his unnamed wife. In other media Sue Dearbon appears in The CW television series The Flash, portrayed by Natalie Dreyfuss. She is first mentioned in the closing moments of season five's finale, when private investigator Ralph Dibny picks up a case file labeled \\"Dearbon\\". During season six, Dibny works to find Sue across multiple cities. Sue herself debuts in the episode \\"A Girl Named Sue\\" after Dibny tracks her down to a seedy Central City apartment. However, she claims she is unable to go home due to her gangster ex-boyfriend John Loring, so Ralph agrees to help her take him down, revealing his secret identity to her in the process. Along the way, she double-crosses him to steal a diamond in the criminal's possession. Even in spite of Loring catching her red-handed and metahuman assassin Ultraviolet arriving to kill her, Ralph saves her from the former while she tricks the latter into focusing on Ralph so she can escape. While investigating the diamond, Sue uncovers information on the crime syndicate Black Hole. In the episode \\"So Long and Goodnight,\\" Ralph and his ally Cisco Ramon encounter Sue while she was robbing banks used by Black Hole as they were extorting her parents before returning the diamond to Ralph and escaping once more. Sue returns in the season finale as a member of Black Hole, having joined them to clear her parents' debt by killing their leader, Joseph Carver. While Ralph talks her out of it, they later learn that Eva McCulloch killed Carver and framed Sue for the crime.

At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and is included in the civil parish of Charwelton. The Domesday Book (1086) confirms the population of Fawsley (Falelau) as around 50, but the Knightley family of Fawsley Hall developed the sheep farming at the expense of their peasant tenants, who were all evicted by the turn of the 15th century. The hall and the church are all that remain of Fawsley. Fawsley Hall Fawsley Hall and landscape park was created by the Knightley family. Richard Knightley, a well-to-do Staffordshire lawyer, bought the manor of Fawsley in 1416. His grandson Richard, knighted by Henry VII, built the first wing of the present house. Interior courtyard of Fawsley Hall Sir Richard's son,http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/knightley- edmund-1491-1542 Sir Edmund Knightley, was a commissioner concerned with the confiscation of monastic lands after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. King Henry VIII granted the manors of Badby and Newnham in 1542 to Sir Edmund Knightley and his wife Ursula and their heirs in exchange for Alderton and Stoke. Sir Edmund ordered the building of the Elizabethan hall, which was visited by Elizabeth I in 1575, after it had passed to Edmund's nephew, Richard Knightley, a prominent Puritan. He ran a secret printing press at the house on which were printed Puritan pamphlets and for which he was briefly imprisoned. The dower house in Fawsley Park, last inhabited in 1704 and now in ruins, was built for Lady Ursula after Sir Edmund died. It was placed on the Heritage at Risk register by English Heritage in 2014. Major stabilisation of the ruins was undertaken during 2016, including the construction of a steel support for the north eastern gable.See https://www.facebook.com/Croft- Building-and-Conservation-Ltd-167254123463119/ April 4, 2016 The Fawsley Estate has also been working with English Heritage and Natural England to prepare a comprehensive scheme of historic landscape restoration. The estate descended in the wider Knightley family, many of them Members of Parliament, to Lucy Knightley, who inherited in 1754 and built the Georgian wing of Fawsley Hall. Lucy Knightley was High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1770‚Äì71. In 1798 Sir John Knightley was created a Baronet. His nephew, Sir Charles Knightley, 2nd Baronet, carried out the Gothic alterations to the Georgian Wing, and his son Sir Rainald, the 3rd Baronet, commissioned architect Anthony Salvin to re-model the North Wing. Sir Rainald married Louisa Knightley and served as MP for South Northamptonshire for 40 years. He was created Baron Rainald in 1892, but died childless in 1895. During this time Joseph Merrick was invited by the family to holiday at the estate and lived in the gamekeeper's cottage.Howell, Michael; Ford, Peter (1992) [1980], The True History of the Elephant Man (3rd ed.), London: Penguin Books, Sir Rainald's widow kept possession of the hall until 1913, after which financial restraints necessitated the auction of the house's contents after her death. She was the last Knightley to live at the Hall, completing 500 years of Knightley occupation. When her eventual heirs Sir Charles Valentine, 5th Baronet died in 1932 and his brother, Sir Henry Francis, 6th and last Baronet, died in 1938, the estate passed to the Gage family of Firle Place, Sussex, by virtue of an earlier marriage of Sir Rainald's sister, Sophia, to Viscount Gage. The Gage family still own the former Knightley lands. Fawsley Hall is now a country house hotel and spa, owned by Hand Picked Hotels. It is one of two buildings in Fawsley listed as Grade I, the other being St Mary's Church.See this list for all the listed buildings. There are three bodies of water near the hotel named Big Waters, The Canal and Horse Pond, the first of which was created using a small dam.Ordnance Survey (2006) Edge Hill & Fenny Compton, sheet 206, 1:25 000.

Dating to the early 13th century, the church has many fine features such as carved poppy heads and stained glass thought to be from Sulgrave Manor.

Demographics  The population at the 2001 census was 179, increasing to 193 at the 2011 census. The parish church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, dates from the late 13th century and is now grade II* listed. The church is constructed of ironstone, which was quarried locally, and the tower was added in the 13th century being located at the west end of the church. The whole church renovated in the 1920s by the Agnew family, owners of Punch magazine, as a memorial to family members killed in World War I. Since 2006, the parish has formed part of the Lambfold benefice, together with the parishes of Blakesley, Maidford, Litchborough and Adstone.  Early history  To the north-east of the village, south of Castle Dykes Farm, is evidence of a univallate hillfort and the buried remains of a Bronze Age barrow. This is a recorded national monument. To the north of Castle Dykes Farm is Castle Dykes, a Norman motte castle with three baileys.

Other Medieval spellings include Fardenston, Ferdingstone, Fardingestun and Fardyngton. The village was given to the Earl of Moreton by his half-brother, William the Conqueror. The land belonged to the Fawsley Hundred. The name of the village is believed to have derived from the Old Norse F√¶r√æegn - the town of the Farndon people. This may have undergone a change in Middle English. Geography The village, which is about above sea level, lies at the headwaters of two streams that run east into the River Nene. Farthingstone is equidistant from both Daventry to the north west, and Towcester to the south east. To the north of the village, towards the village of Everdon, there is extensive woodland.

Biography Born in Perugia, Penna lived in Rome for most of his life. He never had a regular job, contributing to several newspapers and writing almost only poetry. His first poems were published in 1932, through the intervention of Umberto Saba. Openly gay, his works were largely marked by his melanchonic view of homosexuality as emargination. Penna's economic conditions were often poor, and in his late years a group of intellectuals signed a manifesto in the newspaper to help him. His affection for young boys was reflected by the constant presence of young boys in his verses, as well as in his taking a 14-year-old streetboy from Rome, Raffaele, to the home he shared with his mother in 1956 and living with him, on and off, for fourteen years. According to Pier Paolo Pasolini, Penna's poetry was made of \\"an extremely delicate material of city places, with asphalt and grass, whitewashed walls of poor houses, white marbles of the bridges, and everywhere the sea's breath, the murmur of the river in which the trembling night lights reflect\\". His controversial erotic love poems can be found in English translation in This Strange Joy (Ohio State University Press, 1982) and Remember me, God of Love (Carcanet, 1993). An epigram of Penna's about the dark-skinned, dark-eyed, dark-haired Raffaele, scribbled on the back of his portrait by Tano Festa, reads :Ho visto il mio moretto :seduto gi√π in platea :fumava un sigaretto :e gli occhi lustri avea.

In the Middle Ages, Everdon Priory was a small Benedictine priory, located at the eastern end of the village, close to a group of fish pools, which are still extant. It was a daughter house of the abbey of Bernay, in Normandy, and was granted lordship of the manor of Everdon. Like most alien priories, it was dissolved in 1415 under an Act of Henry V. In 1440 Henry VI granted the property of the priory to the newly founded Eton College, which established a manor house on the site.Victoria County History: Northamptonshire, volume 2, chapter 46: the Priory of Everdon A junior branch of the Spencer family from Badby took up the lease of the Eton College Manor house around 1500.

Everdon Stubbs Everdon Stubbs' Bluebells in full bloomEverdon Stubbs is a deciduous woodland covering an area of approximately and was once a famous hunting covert. The land now covered by the woods was originally grazing land for Wild Boar, through which Everdon gets its name (from Old English eofer- d≈´n'boar hill'). In the spring the area is covered with its famous carpet of bluebells, extremely well known throughout the county. Everdon Stubbs is currently open to the public and has conservation work taking place on an ad- hoc basis. St. Mary's Church Located at the centre of the village, Saint Mary's church dates from the 14th century, and was built in the decorated style. It has been suggested that an earlier structure may have sat at this site prior to the current building. The list of incumbents reveals that a rector, Eias Capellinus de Everdone, was appointed in 1218 and the font certainly predates the current church. Local ironstone was used in the construction of the church, and it is believed that the Bernay Monks were involved in the work, importing their own stonemason from France to complete the work. The parts of the building still visible, which date from the 14th century, include the north doorway, the north aisle and east windows, which are detailed with unusual tracery. Some say that it was the churchyard of St Mary‚Äôs, and not St Giles of Stoke Poges, that was the inspiration for Thomas Gray‚Äôs famous elegy \\"In an English Churchyard\\". This theory suggested by Rev. H. Cavalier, the rector of Great Brington in 1926, is based on observations comparing the two churchyards and the lines in the poem. Village events The village has a very strong community spirit, with a number of events taking place on an yearly basis, one of which is the Grand Fete, usually held on the last bank holiday Monday in August. In more recent times, the Everdon Bonfire and Fireworks party, which began in 2006, has become a very successful event, raising funds for the church restoration fund. To coincide with the bluebells of Everdon Stubbs in the spring, a team of village residents host the 'Bluebell Teas' in the village hall, with the hope that people visiting the woods will drop by.

It has a population of approx 5,000 and is situated at an altitude of around 1100 metres. Wau was the site of a gold rush during the 1920s and 30s when prospective gold diggers arrived at the coast at Salamaua and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track. At the Battle of Wau in January 1943, the Australian Army stopped an advance by the Japanese. A road was established soon after World War II to Lae and this fostered the further development of local timber and agricultural industries that were originally established in support of the mining industry. While much of the mineral reserves have been extracted, industrial gold mining continues at Edie Creek and at the newly established Hidden Valley Gold Mine operated by Morobe Goldfields (a subsidiary of Harmony Gold - South Africa). The Wau Ecology Institute is a biological research station situated near Wau. Gold mining history = Gold rush = The first strike at Wau, the start of what would be known as the Morobe Goldfield, was made at Koranga Creek by William ‚ÄòShark-Eye‚Äô Park, probably towards the end of 1921. Park and his partner, Jack Nettleton, ran a clandestine mining operation for twelve months from April 1922 until a new Mining Ordinance enabled them to get their gold out legally. Nettleton, it is known, took out 6000 troy ounces, or about 190 kg, of gold in August 1923. Only a handful of miners worked the field, rich as it was, until 1924. From 1924 to 1926 perhaps 20 miners were on the field producing about 200 kg of gold a year. The real rush began in 1926 with much bigger discoveries at Edie Creek, above Wau. The new rush made air transport viable and Wau's airstrip opened in 1927 by the Parer brothers originally of Spanish descent. In 1928 there were 200 miners and production was about three tonnes a year. The influx of miners was often in conflict with the area's indigenous populations, including the Biangai along the Bulolo River and the Watut along the Watut River. During the early gold rush (1924‚Äì1927) prospectors and carriers employed from the coast followed paths through some of the Biangai villages. Accusations of theft from gardens against coastal carriers resulted a number being killed. In response, miners burned a Biangai village, and killed three men and a woman who died in a house that was burnt down. The beginning of air transport reduced the need for lines of carriers. In 1972, in the 6000 hectares case, PNGLR 71 (19 July 1972) the Biangai won the restitution of the Morobe Goldfields in the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea and compensation was awarded in respect of historical gold sales. =Companies= Unloading WWII transport planes at an advance airfield near Wau in 1943 Park quit Wau in 1926 as a wealthy man. After this properly capitalised companies were formed. New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd (NGG) was the biggest operator, but there were many others: for example, Koranga Gold Sluicing, Sandy Creek Gold Sluicing, Edie Creek Gold Mining Company, The Golden Deeps N.L., Upper Watut Gold Alluvials, Placer Development Limited, and so on. In subsequent years, NGG consolidated control over much of the mineral reserves using its large capitalisation to purchase the smaller leases. Underground mining began with the Day Dawn mine in 1931; a number of similar operations were opened before and after the Second World War. These mines were very small by modern standards, the biggest being Upper Ridges with a total production of 2.9 tonnes over eighteen years. Open cut mining was carried out at Golden Ridges mine between 1932 and 1941, and other pits yielded gold in the Namie area both before and after the war. Most were small and short-lived; the richest was Golden Peaks, producing about six and half tonnes of gold between 1962 and 1977. The Golden Peaks mill also processed ore brought to it by an aerial ropeway from new workings at Upper Ridges. Bulolo Gold Dredging (BGD) began operations at the sister town of Bulolo in 1932 and was responsible for the bulk of pre-war gold production: about 40 tonnes in total. Seven of the eventual eight dredges worked the Bulolo Valley gravels; one only, No. 6, worked in the Wau Valley. Large operations ceased to be attractive after WWII, partly due to pegging of the gold price at pre-war prices and the last dredge ceased operating in 1965. =Alluvial mining= At peak production, the Morobe Goldfield was the largest consumer of indentured labour in the Territory of New Guinea. On 30 June 1936 there were 13,121 labourers in Morobe as a whole, 6816 of whom were classified as involved in mining at Wau and Bulolo. But that was the limit of local involvement until 1957 when the Administration began to issue miner‚Äôs permits to Papua New Guineans. By this time the peak of alluvial production was past, but from this point the proportion of the total in local hands rose to 80% by 1975, according to a 1975 analysis of buying records. Most of the miners were, and still are, operating with the simple methods of dishing and boxing, or gold panning. They make little capital expenditure and have a limited ability to discover new reefs. Production has dropped steadily since a post-war peak in 1953, as the small-scale miners attempt to make a living from alluvial ground constantly worked over since the 1920s. =Timber mills= Timber mills in Wau were started by Roy Hyde in 1935, who arrived with his wife, two sons and a daughter. Timber was floated down the Bulolo river to the coast, which was used for house building in Lae and other resorts along the coast.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 203. It is 3¬Ω miles east of Daventry and ten miles west of Northampton. It is also close to junction 16 of the M1 motorway. The parish consists of some 1,384 acres (560 hectares) and is bounded on the east by the A5 trunk road which is the old Roman road of Watling Street. Most of the village and parish sits astride the valley of an east-flowing stream which is a tributary of the River Nene. Medieval history and later There are considerable earthworks around the village on the northern side of the stream, which indicate that Dodford was a larger settlement than it is today. Many of these earthworks have been ploughed out in recent years, but the evidence has been recorded of their existence.An Inventory of Archaeological Sites in North West Northamptonshire, page 22. These earthworks suggest that there was a large scale de-population or a considerable movement of the village. Dodford is mentioned in an Anglo- Saxon charter of 944.An Inventory of Archaeological Sites in North West Northamptonshire, page 72 (BCS 792). The village is recorded in the Domesday Book as a manor of three hides belonging to Robert, Count of Mortain (who was the half-brother of William the Conqueror), with a recorded population of 22 including a priest. In 1222 the manor of Dodford was acquired by William de Keynes who enclosed much of the land including a deer park which lay to the south of the village between it and what is now the A45 between Daventry and Weedon. In 1673 it is recorded that 39 people paid Hearth Tax. By the early part of the 18th century there were 21 dwellings in the village and a map dated 1742 shows the layout of the village much as it is today.An Inventory of Archaeological Sites in North West Northamptonshire, page 72, 5th par. In 1801 the village is recorded as having 205 residents. St Mary the Virgin church Plan of Dodford Church Dodford has a Grade I listed parish church, called St Mary the Virgin. It was founded by the Normans in 1066, rebuilt by Ralph de Keynes in 1100, and the tower and north chapel were added by William de Keynes in 1221. St Mary's has a nave with a north aisle and a clerestory on the north side only. The arcade, of four bays, is 14th century. The south wall of the nave has two plain 12th century splayed windows, of which the west one is now blocked, and part of the plain arch of a doorway; on the exterior there is much herringbone masonry. The south porch is of two storeys. The chancel was rebuilt in the 19th century. The church contains an elaborately-carved 12th century font. Dodford church has the distinction of being the first church that the antiquary Elias Ashmole (founder of the Ashmolean Museum) is known to have visited with the aim of recording its inscriptions, armorial bearings etc. Ashmole visited Dodford church on 15 April 1657, and his handwritten notes are now in the Bodleian Library. There is a tall 13th century west tower which was structurally crumbling until major repairs in the late 20th century. It contains a ring of six bells, each of which was cast in a different year between 1614 and 1907. The bells hang in a timber frame placed diagonally in the tower. This is a weak layout and the bells remained neglected and unringable for several decades until essential frame strengthening was carried out in 2007.

It is on the south-facing edge of the Marlborough Downs, where the downs adjoin the Vale of Pewsey.  History  A small settlement of 11 households was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, when the lord of the manor was Richard Sturmy or Esturmy. The population of the parish remained low, reaching around 130 at its height between 1831 and 1881, then declining to 30 at the 1971 census. The church and Manor Farm lie some 250 metres north of the present village, along a lane which continues (now as a track) some 1.5 km northwest to the site of the deserted village of Shaw, now in the parishes of Alton and West Overton. By the 18th century there was a hamlet on Huish Hill, straddling the boundary with Wilcot, some 900 metres north of Oare at ; this hamlet began to be abandoned in the 1920s. In 1803, land to the west of Oare village which belonged to the lords of Huish was deemed part of Huish parish. Thus the southeast boundary of Huish extends close to Oare, and Oare school (now Oare Church of England Primary School) is within Huish parish. Cold Blow, a thatched house on the outskirts of Oare, was built in 1921‚Äì22 to designs of Clough Williams-Ellis. A heart-shaped tree plantation was created in 1999, below Huish Hill in the southeast of the parish, near Oare. This is a geoglyph, but not a hill figure like the many surrounding \\"white horses\\" such as the Marlborough White Horse.  Local government  Although a civil parish in its own right, Huish elects a joint parish council with the larger neighbouring parish of Wilcot. The full name of the council is 'Wilcot and Huish (with Oare)'. Huish falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions, and is represented there by Paul Oatway who succeeded Brigadier Robert Hall in 2013.  Parish church  A church was recorded at Huish in 1291. The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was rebuilt in 1785, near the foundations of the 13th-century church but in a smaller size; it was again rebuilt in 1878‚Äì9. In 1924 the benefices of Huish and Oare were united, with the parsonage house to be at Huish. Wilcot was added in 1962. In 1972 the parishes of Huish and Oare were united, and at the same time the benefice was extended by adding Woodborough with Manningford Bohune and Beechingstoke. Today the parish of Huish and Oare is part of the Vale of Pewsey team of churches. The former rectory, a three-bay house in brick of c. 1812, is now a private house.

One branch of this family, known as the Jagiellonian dynasty, reigned also in the Kingdom of Poland, Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Bohemia. Several other branches ranked among the leading aristocratic dynasties of Russia and Poland into recent times. Their monarchical title in Lithuanian primarily was, by some folkloristic data, kunig≈≥ kunigas (\\"Duke of Dukes\\"), and later on, didysis kunigas (\\"Great/High Duke\\") or, in a simple manner, karalius or kunigaik≈°tis. In the 18th century, the latter form was changed into tautological didysis kunigaik≈°tis, which nevertheless would be translated as \\"Grand Duke\\" (for its etymology, see Grand Prince). Origin The origin of Gediminas himself is much debated. Some sources say he was Vytenis' ostler, others that he was of peasant stock. Some historians consider him as the son or grandson of Lithuanian or Yatvingian King/duke Skalmantas. Most scholars agree, however, that Gediminas was Vytenis' brother (the parentage of Vytenis is explained differently in various fake genealogies, compiled from the 16th century onwards; according to the latest Polish research, his parentage cannot be established).Jan Tƒôgowski, \\"Pierwsze pokolenia Gedyminowicz√≥w\\", 1999 Confirmed Gediminid rulers * Gediminas * Jaunutis * Algirdas * Jogaila * Kƒôstutis * Vytautas ‚Äì King/Grand Duke from 1392 to 1430 * ≈†vitrigaila * ≈Ωygimantas Kƒôstutaitis * Kazimieras Jogailaitis * Aleksandras * ≈Ωygimantas Senasis * ≈Ωygimantas Augustas  Branches of the dynasty  The Gediminid symbol in Rambynas Hill, Lithuania The Eastern Orthodox branches of the family were mostly Ruthenian, which also was one of the two main languages of their established state.

The road is known as Welford Road in the village and runs along the top of the ridge on which the village stands giving it extensive views east and west. About north on the road the A5199 connects with the A14 trunk road, a dual carriageway connecting the M1 and M6 motorways from the Catthorpe Interchange with Kettering, Cambridge, Ipswich and the port of Felixstowe. Governance The village has its own Parish Council and is part of Daventry Parliamentary Constituency. The Daventry constituency has been represented by a member of the Conservative Party since 1974. The local district council is Daventry District Council where Creaton is in Spratton ward together with the villages of Cottesbrooke, Spratton itself and surrounding rural areas. The village is in the Northamptonshire County Council area. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Creaton Magna' (now the main part of the village) and 'Creaton Parva' (now Little Creaton). In the centre of the village, across Grooms Lane, are the foundations of the house where Amphylis Twigden, great- great grandmother of George Washington, first President of the United States was born and lived. Twigden married the Revd Lawrence Washington, son of Lawrence Washington (1602‚Äì1652). Their son, John Washington, emigrated to America and was the father of George.

All Saints Church All Saints ChurchA long, cruciform church of ca1300, although the north transept has been demolished. Much restoration has been carried out on the building, most recently in 1959-60 by John Seely, Lord Mottistone. The large geometric windows cannot be relied upon and may have once been foliated. The south doorway and porch is in a good state, as is the West tower. The tower has two-light Y-traced bell-openings supported by circular mullions, well preserved shafting on the interior windows with capitals, both carved and plain, and also a number of small exterior head-stops. It contains a ring of eight bells, comprising six bells cast by Henry Bagley II of Chacombe in 1702, with the heaviest bell (tenor) weighing and two lighter bells cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1995. The two east windows, glazed with coloured panes, are believed to be Georgian in origin, being referred to as 'recent' additions in documents dating from 1849. The nave roof has a ceiling, the painted imitation-plasterwork in the covings being of interest, believed to be 18th century work. During the last restoration, the plaster ceilings in the chancel and the remaining south transept were removed, exposing roof timbers from the 15th century. There is a reredos and communion table by Lord Mottistone in the Wrenian style. These are placed halfway along the chancel so that a vestry is formed behind. A wooden font and cover dates from the 18th century and is kept at Cottesbrooke Hall and may be viewed by appointment. The church has one of few examples of a three-tier Georgian pulpit in the county and country, and is fitted with fine box pews. There is a staircase with balusters leading to the Squire's pew in the south transept of similar date. There is a small 'squint', with delicately carved hoodmoulding, in the junction between the chancel and the south transept. The church plate, consisting of a Cup and Paten from 1635 and also two Flagons and a Breadholder of 1665, is held at Cottesbrooke Hall.

He played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), beginning his career as a third baseman with the Atlanta Braves (1969‚Äì1976, 1989), alternating between first and third base with the San Francisco Giants (1976‚Äì1983), and playing much of his later career as a first baseman and then a designated hitter for the Detroit Tigers (1984‚Äì1988). He won a World Series championship with the Tigers in 1984. Evans had most of his success in the early and late stages of his career. He was a two-time All-Star, first with the Braves in 1973 and then with the Giants in 1983. He led MLB in home runs in 1985 with the Tigers, and walks in 1973 and 1974 with the Braves. Born in Pasadena, California, Evans was the son of a professional fast pitch softball player. He attended Pasadena City College and helped lead the baseball and basketball teams to California junior college championships. In the majors, Evans had a breakout season in 1973, finishing third in MLB with 41 home runs and leading the league in runs created and walks. He was traded to the San Francisco Giants in the middle of his lackluster 1976 season. His best season with the Giants was his 1983 All-Star season when he hit 30 home runs and compiled a .378 on-base percentage in his last year with the team. Evans signed as a free agent with the Detroit Tigers prior to the 1984 season, winning the World Series in his first year with the team. He led MLB in home runs in 1985 at age 38, becoming the oldest player to lead the American League in home runs and the first in MLB history to have a 40-homer season in both the American and the National Leagues. Evans concluded his playing career with a return to the Braves in 1989. Baseball historian Bill James rated Evans as \\"the most underrated player in baseball history.\\" He was the 22nd player in MLB history to hit 400 home runs and the second to hit at least 100 home runs with three different teams. His 1,605 walks ranked eighth in MLB history at the time of his retirement. His skill in drawing walks contributed to a .361 career on-base percentage despite a .248 career batting average. After retiring as a player, Evans served as a manager and coach in Minor League Baseball and independent leagues from 1990 to 2010. His career as a manager included stints with the Wilmington Blue Rocks and the Huntsville Stars in the minors. Early years Evans was born in 1947 in Pasadena, California to Eleanor (n√©e Salazar, 1923‚Äì2013) and Richard Evans, both of whom came from baseball families. His mother and her sister Margaret played professional fast pitch softball together for a national championship team in Southern California, and his aunt in particular was selected as an All-American outfielder. Evans attended his mother's softball games as an infant and later served as the team's bat boy. His father was a sheet metal mechanic who had played college baseball. Both of Evans' parents had relatives in professional baseball. His maternal grandfather Dave Salazar was a pitcher in the Chicago White Sox organization and played for the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific Coast League. His uncle Bob Evans had also played minor league ball in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization. Evans attended John Muir High School in Pasadena. He played baseball at Muir as a right-handed throwing pitcher and third baseman who batted left handed. In March 1965, he threw a no-hitter for Muir. In the fall of 1965, Evans enrolled at Pasadena City College (PCC). As a freshman during the 1965‚Äì66 academic year, he was the leading scorer for PCC's basketball team and led the baseball team with a .423 batting average. In December 1965, he scored 12 points in a losing effort against a UCLA team featuring Lew Alcindor. During the 1966‚Äì67 academic year, he hit .451 for the PCC baseball team and led both the baseball and basketball teams to California junior college championships. His basketball coach during the 1966‚Äì67 season was Jerry Tarkanian. Evans received the school's athlete of the year award in 1967, and he was later inducted into the PCC Hall of Fame as \\"the ultimate in Pasadena City College legends.\\" Professional baseball player =Minor leagues= Evans was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1965, the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers in 1966, and the Philadelphia Phillies and Kansas City Athletics in 1967. He originally didn't sign with the Cubs out of high school because he was planning to play baseball on full scholarship at the University of Southern California, but that did not materialize. In June 1967, he finally signed a pro contract with the Athletics, receiving a $15,000 signing bonus. Evans played for three different minor league clubs during the 1967 season: Leesburg in the Florida State League, Peninsula in the Carolina League, and Bradenton of the Gulf Coast League. He compiled a .326 batting average with a .402 on-base percentage in 61 minor league games during the 1967 season. In his time at Bradenton, he hit .489. He was named 1967 player of the year in the Gulf Coast League. He spent the 1968 season with Birmingham in the Southern League. Evans's playing time was limited in 1967 and 1968 by his service in the United States Marine Corps. Evans later recalled that his arm was \\"sore and gone\\" after his discharge from the Marines, resulting in a poor performance in 1968. Evans compiled a .248 batting average and .299 on-base percentage in 56 games for Birmingham. Alf Van Hoose, sports editor of The Birmingham News recalled Evans as \\"a terrible infielder\\" with a \\"smooth swing.\\" =Atlanta Braves= 1969 to 1972 seasons In December 1968, after the A's chose not to include Evans on their list of protected minor league players, Evans was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the Rule 5 draft for $25,000. Evans began the 1969 season with the Braves but was limited to pinch-hitting. In late April 1969, he was sent down to the Shreveport Braves in Double-A ball. He was then promoted to the Richmond Braves of the Triple-A International League where he hit .360 with a .433 on-base percentage in 59 games. He was recalled to Atlanta in late August 1969, but hit only .231 in 26 at bats. Evans spent most of the 1970 season at Richmond where he hit .300 with 47 extra base hits and 83 RBIs in 120 games. He hit .318 in 44 at bats for Atlanta in 1970, but Atlanta manager Lum Harris continued to relegate Evans to the minors due to his \\"mediocre fielding\\". Evans received the nickname \\"Clank\\" due to his fielding difficulties. He also acquired the nickname \\"Howdy Doody\\" due to his resemblance to the popular television puppet of the same name. Evans began the 1971 season with Richmond where he was moved to the outfield and batted .307 with a .437 on-base percentage. In late May, Evans received an opportunity to become the Braves' starting third baseman when the team released Clete Boyer following Boyer's open criticism of the team's general manager. Evans appeared in 72 games at the third base for the 1971 Braves; he hit .242 in 260 at bats in his rookie season. Atlanta hitting coach (and later manager) Eddie Mathews worked with Evans on his fielding. Evans later recalled: \\"Eddie was not only my manager, he was my friend. He used to talk to me, pump into me that I had to do it.\\" In 1972, Evans was the Braves' regular third baseman, appearing in 125 games. He demonstrated his control of the strike zone, drawing 90 walks (fifth in the National League) and compiling a .384 on-base percentage (seventh in the league). Although his 25 errors ranked second among National League third basemen, he improved defensively, leading the league's third basemen with a range factor of 3.24 per game and ranking high among the league's third basemen with 126 putouts (second), 273 assists (fourth), and 20 double plays (fourth). 1973 breakout season Evans had a breakout season in 1973. He was selected as the reserve third baseman (behind starter Ron Santo) on the 1973 National League All-Star team, ultimately finishing the year with 41 home runs (third in MLB behind Willie Stargell and teammate Davey Johnson) and an on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) of .959 (third in MLB behind teammate Hank Aaron and Stargell). Evans also led the major leagues in walks with 125 and runs created with 143. With his high walk rate, he reached based 294 times, second only to Pete Rose, and had a .403 on-base percentage. Additionally, he was third in extra-base hits with 74, and also finished fourth in runs scored with 114 and fifth in RBIs with 105. This was the only season of Evans's career where he had over 100 runs or 100 RBIs. He also ranked among the best defensive third basemen in the National League with a 3.08 range factor per game (first in NL), 124 putouts (second in NL), and 325 assists (second in NL). Evans told reporters in July 1973 that his defensive improvement \\"has meant more to me than the home runs.\\" Evans' 1973 accomplishments were overshadowed by teammate Hank Aaron's pursuit of Babe Ruth's career home run record. Evans responded to the lack of attention to his accomplishments, telling reporters in August 1973: \\"I can't say it bothers me. Hell, I enjoy reading about Hank, just like everyone else.\\" Evans hit before Aaron in the Braves' batting order, and in April the following season, he was on first base when Aaron hit his historic 715th home run. The 1973 Braves were the first team in major league history to have three players ‚Äì Evans, Aaron, and Davey Johnson ‚Äì hit at least 40 home runs. Despite the surge in power, the 1973 Braves finished fifth in the National League West with a 76‚Äì85 record due to a pitching staff that allowed the most runs in the National League. 1974 to 1976 seasons Prior to the 1974 season, Evans pursued salary arbitration, where he was awarded a $52,500 salary. Evans appeared in 160 games at third base for the Braves. For the second consecutive year, he led the majors in walks, tallying a career- high 126 bases on balls. In a remarkable turn-around, the player formerly known as \\"Clank\\" had a 3.45 range factor and led all National League third basemen with a 2.7 Defensive Wins Above Replacement rating. He also ranked among the National League's leaders with 269 times on base (fourth), 25 home runs (tied for sixth), 99 runs scored (seventh), and a 7.2 overall Wins Above Replacement rating (seventh). His 1974 performance was nevertheless considered disappointing in light of a 41-point drop in his batting average and expectations created by his 1973 season. Evans attributed his less impressive performance in part to \\"personal problems, some private things that were bothering me.\\" The 1975 season was Evans' final full season with the Braves. Following the trade of Hank Aaron, Evans took over Aaron's third spot in the batting over. After a strong start in April, Evans' output slowed. He ended up batting .243 in 156 games. His power output also declined, as he totaled just 22 home runs and 73 RBIs to go along with a .406 slugging percentage. Evans' output declined further at the start of the 1976 season. With Jerry Royster taking over at third base, Evans was moved to first base. After 44 games, Evans' batting average stood at .173 with only one home run. He sought to remedy the slump by switching from contact lenses to glasses. Evans later recalled: \\"It was the one time in my career when I really doubted myself. I couldn't seem to do anything right. I couldn't see the ball very well and I wasn't being patient at the plate. Then I'd take a pitch and it would be right down the middle.\\" =San Francisco Giants= Evans with the Giants in 1983 On June 13, 1976, the Braves traded Evans with Marty Perez to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for Willie Monta√±ez, Craig Robinson, and two other players. He promptly became the Giants' starting first baseman. In his first season in San Francisco, Evans compiled a .222 batting average with 10 home runs in 92 games. In his early years with the Giants, Evans shifted between left field, third base, and first base. In 1978, he settled in at third base, starting 612 games at that position from 1978 to 1982. In 1983, Evans shifted back to first base and had his best season in San Francisco. He was named to the National League All-Star team as a reserve first baseman, hit 30 home runs and compiled a .378 on-base percentage and .516 slugging percentage. He won the team's 1983 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. Evans spent eight seasons with the Giants, appearing in 1,094 games, compiling a .255 batting average, .358 on-base percentage, and .422 slugging percentage with 142 home runs, 525 RBIs and 605 walks. =Detroit Tigers= 1984 season and World Series After the 1983 season, Evans entered the free agent market. He was selected by 17 teams, more than any other player, in the November 1983 re-entry draft. In December 1983, he became the first \\"big name\\" free agent to be signed by the Detroit Tigers. He signed a three-year contract worth approximately $2.25 million. Playing for the World Series champion 1984 Detroit Tigers, Evans hit a three-run home run in his first regular season game in a Detroit uniform on the road against Minnesota. One week later, he hit another three-run home run with his first swing at Tiger Stadium. For the season, he appeared in 131 games, 62 as the designated hitter, 47 at first base, and 19 at third base. His .238 batting average was the lowest since 1976, but 77 walks (seventh in the American League) boosted his on-base percentage to .353. He also totaled 16 home runs and 63 RBIs for the 1984 Tigers. In the 1984 World Series, Evans managed only one hit in 15 at bats for a .067 batting average. Evans' father died at the end of July 1984 after a long battle with cancer, and Evans missed several games to attend the funeral in California. He later recalled that it was the greatest disappointment of his life that his father was not able to see him play in the World Series. 1985 season and home run title In 1985, Evans had one of the best offensive seasons of his career. He appeared in 151 games, 113 at first base, 33 as the designated hitter, and seven at third base. At age 38, he led the major leagues with 40 home runs. He was the oldest player to register 40 home runs in American League history, the oldest player to lead the American League in home runs, and the first player to hit 40 home runs in both the National and American Leagues. He also registered a .356 on-base percentage (as a result of drawing 85 walks), and his .519 slugging percentage was his best since his breakout season in 1973. He was selected by both Detroit sports writers and fans for the 1985 Tiger of the Year award. 1986 to 1988 seasons At the start of the 1986 season, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson announced that Evans would not be the Tigers' first baseman and would instead be the team's designated hitter. Evans publicly expressed his frustration at losing his spot in the lineup after hitting 40 home runs. In the end, Anderson relented, and Evans played 105 games at first base and 42 as the designated hitter for the 1986 Tigers. He hit 29 home runs and 85 RBIs while compiling a .356 on-base percentage. Evans' three-year contract expired after the 1986 season, and the Tigers decided not to offer him a contract to avoid triggering Evans' arbitration rights. No other teams made offers to Evans, and in late February 1987, he signed a one- year contract with the Tigers; the contract cut his salary by $200,000 to between $500,000 and $550,000. During the 1987 season, Evans appeared in 150 games for the Tigers, including 105 at first base and 44 as the designated hitter. He drew 100 walks in 1987, fourth most in the American League, pumping his on-base percentage to .379, his highest since 1974. He also hit 34 home runs, had 99 RBIs (second most in his career), and finished 12th in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. In the 1987 American League Championship Series, he compiled a .294 batting average and .455 on- base percentage. However, he was also picked off at third base in the fourth game of the ALCS, \\"hammering the final nail\\" into the Tigers' defeat. Evans returned to Detroit for one last season in 1988. He appeared in 144 games (72 at DH, 65 at 1B) and had 22 home runs, including his 400th career homer in September, but he saw his batting average drop precipitously to .208. At the end of the 1988 season, the Tigers announced that Evans, age 41, would not be offered a contract for the 1989 season. Evans appeared in 727 games in five years with the Tigers, hit 141 home runs, and compiled a .358 on-base percentage and .450 slugging percentage. =Swan song with the Braves= In December 1988, Evans signed to return to the Atlanta Braves for the 1989 season. He appeared in 109 games with the 1989 Braves, compiling a .207 batting average with 11 home runs. He appeared in his final major league game on October 1, 1989, at age 42. At the beginning of April 1990, the Braves released Evans, ending his playing career. At the time, Evans told the Associated Press: \\"It's happened to a lot of my friends and it's not easy. I guess when it slaps you in the face you don't know how to feel. I don't know what to expect because I've never been in this situation before.\\" Evans appeared in 866 games in nine years with the Braves, hitting 131 home runs and compiling a .368 on-base percentage. =Career highlights= Evans played 21 seasons in the majors and appeared in 2,687 games. Evans compiled a .248 batting average (2,223-for-8,973) with 1,344 runs, 329 doubles, 36 triples, 414 home runs, 1,354 RBI, 98 stolen bases, 1,605 base on balls, 1,410 strikeouts, .361 on-base percentage and .431 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .973 fielding percentage. Evans was the 22nd player in baseball history to total 400 home runs. He was also the first player to hit 40 home runs in a season in both leagues. He hit over 20 home runs in 10 different seasons, and he was only the second player in major league history (after Reggie Jackson) to hit at least 100 home runs with three different clubs. Evans hit 60 home runs after reaching age 40, at the time a major league record. Evans drew 100 or more walks five times (1973‚Äì1975, 1978, and 1987). His career total of 1,605 walks ranked eighth in major league history at the time of his retirement and remains 12th most in major league history. Evans has been described by author and pioneering sabremetrician Bill James as \\"the most underrated player in baseball history, absolutely number one on the list\\".James, Bill, The New Historical Baseball Abstract, p. 547 In The Bill James Handbook 2019, James also rated Evans No. 7 on his list of \\"The 25 Best Players Who Are Not in the Hall of Fame.\\" Managerial and coaching career Evans as manager in Victoria In June 1990, two months after his release by the Braves, Evans was hired by the New York Yankees as the team's hitting instructor, amid rumors that he may eventually be asked to take over Stump Merrill's job as manager. Evans was credited with making a change in rookie Kevin Maas' swing, allowing him to more effectively reach Yankee Stadium's short right field fence. At the end of the 1990 season, the Yankees named Graig Nettles as its hitting coach and announced that Evans would not return in 1991. Evans later worked as a minor-league instructor. He was also the manager for several minor league teams, including stints with the Tyler Wildcatters of the independent Texas-Louisiana League in 1997, the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the South Atlantic League in 1998, the Huntsville Stars in the Double-A Southern League in 1999, the Aberdeen Arsenal of the independent Atlantic League in 2000, and the Allentown Ambassadors in the independent Northern League in 2002. From 2005 to 2007, Evans was the manager of the Long Beach Armada in the independent Golden Baseball League. He led Armada to the GBL championship in 2007. He then served in 2008 as the bench and hitting coach for the Orange County Flyers, a team managed by Gary Carter. The Flyers beat Calgary for the 2008 GBL championship. Evans was hired in November 2009 as the first manager and director of player personnel for the newly-organized Victoria Seals of the GBL. In March 2010, he was fired after the owner learned that Evans was seeking employment as a manager with another club. Evans also managed the Palm Springs Chill in 2009 in the California Winter League. After being fired by the Victoria club, Evans was hired in 2010 as the manager of the St. George RoadRunners in the GBL. Family and later years Evans and his wife LaDonna had four children. In 1984, Evans publicly revealed that, in the summer of 1982, he and his wife had seen a UFO from the porch of their home in Pleasanton, California. Evans described the UFO hovering over his neighbor's house as appearing \\"like a flying wing\\", triangular in shape with no wings and with green and red lights on the sides and white lights on the back. In the mid-2000s, Evans worked as a consultant for Netamin Corporation in the development of its Ultimate Baseball Online multiplayer online game.

The name El Malpais is from the Spanish term Malpa√≠s, meaning badlands, due to the extremely barren and dramatic volcanic field that covers much of the park's area. It is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.Trail of the Ancients. New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014. Geography and geology Lava Fields and sandstone bluff The lava flows, cinder cones, and other volcanic features of El Malpais are part of the Zuni-Bandera volcanic field, the second largest volcanic field in the Basin and Range Province. This volcanically active area on the southeast margin of the Colorado Plateau is at the intersection of the Rio Grande Rift Basin, with its deep normal faulting, and the ancient Jemez Lineament. These two features provide the crustal weaknesses that recent magmatic intrusions and Cenozoic volcanism are attributed to. The rugged pƒÅhoehoe and  ªa ªƒÅ lava flows of the Zuni-Bandera eruptions (also called the Grants Lava Flows) filled a large basin, created by normal faulting associated with the Rio Grande Rift, between the high mesas of the Acoma Pueblo to the east, Mt. Taylor to the north, and the Zuni Mountain anticline to the northwest. Vents associated with these flows include Bandera Crater, El Calderon, and several other cinder cones; more than a dozen older cinder cones follow a roughly north-south distribution along the Chain of Craters west of the monument. Features Looking out of Giant Ice Cave in the Big Tube area El Malpais has many lava tubes open to explore (unguided) with a free caving permit, available at NPS-staffed facilities. There are currently four caves accessible by permit: Junction and Xenolith caves in the El Caldron area, and Big Skylight and Giant Ice caves in the Big Tubes area. From December 2010 to June 2013, all caves were temporarily closed to recreational use to protect bats from the spread of White Nose Syndrome (WNS) until a permitting process, including visitor screening for WNS, could be implemented. A nearby scenic overlook at Sandstone Bluffs offers spectacular panoramic views over the monument's lava flows. Natural history Some of the oldest Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga) trees on earth, of the Pseudotsuga subspecies Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca), can be found living in El Malpais Monument. History A map of late Cenozoic volcanism around the Colorado Plateau, with the location of El Malpais National Monument highlighted. The area around El Malpais was used for resources, settlement, and travel by Oasisamerica cultures, Native Americans, and Spanish colonial and pioneer exploration. Archaeological sites remain in the park. In the 1940s the Malpais lava field was one of the eight candidate sites considered by the Manhattan Project to test detonate the first atomic bomb, the Trinity nuclear test, which did occur to the south at White Sands Proving Ground. The Department of Defense did use the site as a bombing range to train pilots during World War II. After the war, the Bureau of Land Management became the administrator of the area. In 1987, President Reagan signed that created El Malpais National Monument and designated it a unit of the National Park Service. It is jointly managed with the nearby El Morro National Monument. Protection and management El Malpais National Conservation Area: La Ventana Natural Arch The U.S. National Park Service protects, manages, and interprets El Malpais National Monument. They operate two Visitor Centers with natural history displays, literature, maps, and staff with helpful information. El Malpais Visitor Center (formerly The Northwest New Mexico Visitor Center) is just south of Exit 85 off I-40 in Grants, New Mexico. The El Malpais Information Center is 28 miles down Highway 53 south of I-40 Exit 81. The adjacent El Malpais National Conservation Area is protected and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. They staff the El Malpais National Conservation Area Ranger Station 8 miles down State Highway 117 south of I-40 Exit 89. The Cibola National Forest conserves large natural areas, wildlife, and habitats in the surrounding region as well. In literature The second portion of the book Brave New World by Aldous Huxley takes place on the \\"savage reservation\\", which is located on land encompassing the park's area. The malpais is the setting for a western story, \\"Flint\\" (November, 1960) by Louis L'Amour. Flint is a successful business man who thinks he is dying of cancer and returns to a hidden campsite within the malpais he had learned of in his youth. A scene in Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian takes place on the malpais.

Presentation to NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility staff. is a set of training procedures for use in environments where human error can have devastating effects. Used primarily for improving aviation safety, CRM focuses on interpersonal communication, leadership, and decision making in the cockpit of an airliner. Its pioneer is David Beaty, a former Royal Air Force pilot and later a BOAC pilot who wrote his seminal book The Human Factor in Aircraft Accidents first published in 1969. Despite the considerable development of electronic aids since then, many principles he developed continue to prove effective today. Crew resource management formally began with a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation made during their investigation of the 1978 United Airlines Flight 173 crash. The issues surrounding that crash included a DC-8 crew running out of fuel over Portland, Oregon, while troubleshooting a landing gear problem.\\"United Flight 232.\\" Retrieved 2007-03-27. Presentation to NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility staff. The term \\"cockpit resource management\\" (later generalized to \\"crew resource management\\") was coined in 1979 by NASA psychologist John Lauber who had studied communication processes in cockpits for several years. While retaining a command hierarchy, the concept was intended to foster a less authoritarian cockpit culture, where co-pilots were encouraged to question captains if they observed them making mistakes. Crew resource management grew out of the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster where two Boeing 747 aircraft collided on the runway, killing 583 people. A few weeks later, NASA held a workshop on the topic, endorsing this innovative training.Cooper, G.E., White, M.D., & Lauber, J.K. (Eds.) 1980. \\"Resource management on the flightdeck,\\" Proceedings of a NASA/Industry Workshop (NASA CP-2120). United Airlines was the first airline to provide CRM training for its cockpit crews in 1981. By the 1990s, it had become a global standard. United Airlines additionally trained their flight attendants to use CRM in conjunction with the pilots to provide another layer of enhanced communication and teamwork. Studies have shown that by both work groups using CRM together, communication barriers are reduced and problems can be solved more efficiently, leading to increased safety. CRM training concepts have been modified for application to a wide range of activities where people must make dangerous time-critical decisions. These arenas include air traffic control, ship handling, firefighting, and medical operating rooms.Diehl, Alan (June, 1994). \\"Crew Resource Management...It's Not Just for Fliers Anymore.\\" Flying Safety, USAF Safety Agency. Overview CRM aviation training has gone by several names, including cockpit resource management, flightdeck resource management, and command, leadership, and resource management, but the current generic term, crew resource management, was widely adopted. When CRM techniques are applied to other arenas, they are sometimes given unique labels, such as maintenance resource management or maritime resource management. CRM training encompasses a wide range of knowledge, skills, and attitudes including communications, situational awareness, problem solving, decision making, and teamwork; together with all the attendant sub-disciplines which each of these areas entails. CRM can be defined as a system which utilises resources to promote safety within the workplace. CRM is concerned with the cognitive and interpersonal skills needed to manage resources within an organized system, not so much with the technical knowledge and skills required to operate equipment. In this context, cognitive skills are defined as the mental processes used for gaining and maintaining situational awareness, for solving problems and for making decisions. Interpersonal skills are regarded as communications and a range of behavioral activities associated with teamwork. In many operational systems as in other walks of life, skill areas often overlap with each other, and they also overlap with the required technical skills. Furthermore, they are not confined to multi-crew craft or equipment, but also relate to single operator equipment or craft as they invariably need to interface with other craft or equipment and various other support agencies in order to complete a mission successfully. CRM training for crew has been introduced and developed by aviation organizations including major airlines and military aviation worldwide. CRM training is now a mandated requirement for commercial pilots working under most regulatory bodies worldwide, including the FAA (U.S.) and EASA (Europe). Following the lead of the commercial airline industry, the U.S. Department of Defense began formally training its air crews in CRM in the mid 1980s.Diehl, Alan (November 5, 1992) \\"The Effectiveness of Civil and Military Cockpit Management Training Programs.\\" Flight Safety Foundation, 45th International Air Safety Seminar, Long Beach, CA. Presently, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy require all air crew members to receive annual CRM training, in an effort to reduce human- error caused mishaps.Air Force Instruction 11-290: OPNAVINST 1542.7C: The U.S. Army has its own version of CRM called Aircrew Coordination Training Enhanced (ACT-E). Skills of CRM The primary goal of CRM is enhanced situational awareness, self awareness, leadership, assertiveness, decision making, flexibility, adaptability, event and mission analysis, and communication. Specifically, CRM aims to foster a climate or culture where authority may be respectfully questioned. It recognizes that a discrepancy between what is happening and what should be happening is often the first indicator that an error is occurring. This is a delicate subject for many organizations, especially ones with traditional hierarchies, so appropriate communication techniques must be taught to supervisors and their subordinates, so that supervisors understand that the questioning of authority need not be threatening, and subordinates understand the correct way to question orders. Since the beginning of this century european aviation legislation asks for the assessment of CRM skills of flight crew. Therefore, it was recognised that there was a need for a system to assess pilots‚Äô CRM skills taking note of the delicacy of the matter. Several systems exists to objectify performance in CRM skills, an example widely used in Europe is NOTECHS. = Communication = Cockpit voice recordings of various air disasters reveal first officers and flight engineers attempting to bring critical information to the captain's attention in an indirect and ineffective way. By the time the captain understood what was being said, it was too late to avert the disaster. A CRM expert named Todd Bishop developed a five-step assertive statement process that encompasses inquiry and advocacy steps: * Opening or attention getter - Address the individual: \\"Hey Chief,\\" or \\"Captain Smith,\\" or \\"Bob,\\" or whatever name or title will get the person's attention. * State your concern - Express your analysis of the situation in a direct manner while owning your emotions about it. \\"I'm concerned that we may not have enough fuel to fly around this storm system,\\" or \\"I'm worried that the roof might collapse.\\" * State the problem as you see it - \\"We're showing only 40 minutes of fuel left,\\" or \\"This building has a lightweight steel truss roof, and we may have fire extension into the roof structure.\\" * State a solution - \\"Let's divert to another airport and refuel,\\" or \\"I think we should pull some tiles and take a look with the thermal imaging camera before we commit crews inside.\\" * Obtain agreement (or buy-in) - \\"Does that sound good to you, Captain?\\" These are often difficult skills to master, as they may require significant changes in personal habits, interpersonal dynamics, and organizational culture.  \\"This is stupid!\\"  In certain cases during critical emergencies, the affirmative statement method may not be appropriate, and it may be necessary to call attention to a danger even when the solution is unknown. \\"This is stupid\\" may be replaced with a less \\"charged\\" callsign such as \\"Red Flag\\", to indicate an immediate review of the situation is needed, without accusing anyone in particular, as the intention is to focus on actions and plans, not to insult anyone's competence. Personal statements like \\"You are stupid\\" can cause the listener to become defensive and make the entire method counterproductive.  Sender errors  There are several common errors that a sender can make, which might cause a message to be misinterpreted. * No frame of reference - If the receiver is missing context for the message, they are less likely to understand accurately. * Omission of information - The sender neglects to clarify important parts of the message, leaving ambiguity. * Inserting bias - The sender inserts a personal opinion into a message that should be unbiased facts. This can cause the message to seem less trustworthy, or mislead the receiver about critical facts. * Ignoring body language - It is quite possible to send an unintended message with body language and tone, or lack thereof in a medium that does not properly convey it. * Being unwilling to repeat information - Especially in the presence of distraction, it is easy for a receiver to miss something important. * Disrespectful communication - It is hard to think logically about a message presented in a hostile way.  Receiver errors  * Listening with prejudice - If the listener's mind is already made up before the sender speaks, vital details may be missed. * Poor preparation - Listening is an active and conscious process that must be treated as such. * Thinking ahead of the sender - Extrapolating, putting words in the sender's mouth. The sender saying \\"Hear me out!\\" may be a sign of this. * Ignoring nonverbal cues - Failure to understand the full intended effect of the message. * Failure to ask for clarification - When in doubt, rather than try to guess what the sender means, simply asking can be a lot more effective. * Disrespectful communication - Replying with a knee-jerk insult will degrade communication. = Leadership and followership = Both leadership and followership are needed at different times, and both present unique challenges and skill requirements.  Leadership  = Authority = Legitimate authority in CRM is reinforced through four main points: * Ensuring mission safety - The leader is ultimately responsible for crew safety, although safety requires active participation by all members. * Fostering respectful communication * Establishing clearly defined goals * Including crew input = Mentoring = A leader is responsible for mentoring a crew, both to maintain a high level of technical competence, and to build trust, which is critical for effective operations. A lack of trust may have been a major factor in the tragedy ensuing from the Mann Gulch Fire. = Conflict resolution = Conflict can arise on any team, and can be healthy or unhealthy depending on how it's handled. Effective listening, remaining emotionally uninvolved, and a focus on understanding the cause of a situation can help a leader resolve conflicting voices. = Mission analysis = A leader is responsible for understanding the task at hand, and all its potential risks and benefits, and developing plans to safely meet the objectives.  Followership  Far from a passive process, being an effective follower requires a conscious effort. CRM empowers followers to challenge a leader when needed, but this right is given with the expectation that followers must act responsibly and continually develop their skills. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to: * Respecting authority * Being safe * Keeping one's ego in check * Balancing assertiveness and respect * Demanding clear assignments * Reporting on status of work honestly, including any problems * Publicly acknowledging mistakes = Self assessment = The condition of every team member is important to success. A follower must be able to assess their own condition, determine where they need improving, and in some cases, avoid performing tasks that they are in no condition to perform. Many procedures such as the IMSAFE checklist have been developed to assess if a crew member is properly fit to perform his or her duties. To perform at their best, followers must be: * Physically fit * Hydrated * Nourished * Rested In addition, there are many sources of stress that can cause a crew member to perform at less than their best. It is important to be aware of stressors that may be affecting you. Sources of stress can include, but are not limited to: * Hunger * Dehydration * Fear of punishments or desire for rewards * Noise * Anxiety * Drugs * Temperature extremes * Existing stress outside of the job  Desire to make the leader succeed  Even the best leaders have finite capacity. An example is the limited capacity to remember more than a certain amount of data. By understanding this, and having a genuine desire to assist the leader, a follower can make up for this limitation by referring to checklists or other references. A follower is expected to put the mission ahead of their ego, and make success a higher priority than \\"being right\\", while still coming forward about any problems they may encounter. = Recognizing hazardous attitudes = Hazardous attitudes can lead to unsafe behavior, which is why it is important to reframe the hazardous thoughts to allow for clearer judgement. After recognizing a thought, plan, or attitude as potentially dangerous, a crew member should remind themselves of the corresponding antidote. Antidotes should be memorized so they automatically come to mind as needed. The number of attitudes can vary in different publications, but is generally between five and seven.  Hazardous attitudes  * Anti-authority: \\"Don‚Äôt tell me.\\" - \\"Follow the rules. They are there for a reason\\". The rules are quite often \\"written in blood\\", in response to a major incident. * Impulsivity: \\"Do it quickly.\\" - \\"Not so fast. Think first.\\" As the soldier's saying is said to go, \\"Slow is smooth and smooth is fast\\". * Invulnerability: \\"It won't happen to me.\\" - \\"It could happen to me.\\" Even if someone has done it a thousand times before. Just because luck has been on one's side before doesn't mean that one doesn't need to be careful. * Machismo: \\"I can do it.\\" - \\"Taking chances is foolish.\\" Even experts can fall victim to things they didn't expect. * Resignation: \\"What's the use?\\" - \\"I'm not helpless. I can make a difference.\\" History is full of cases in which people have survived seemingly impossible odds. * Pressing: \\"Let's hurry up so we can go home\\" - \\"It's worth doing right the first time.\\" Pressing is related to impulsivity, but often driven by a desire to return to something other than the task, the proverbial \\"roast in the oven\\". * Airshow syndrome: \\"I'm going to look amazing!\\" - \\"Let's get the job done right\\". Doing the job done right often involves mundane things that don't \\"make a good show\\", but doing the job wrong will look much worse. = Situational awareness = Loss of awareness of what's happening around you can easily end in tragedy. Situational awareness must be a constant state of understanding what's happening, combined with the alertness to notice changes.  Indicators of loss of situational awareness  * Ambiguity - The information used to make decisions is not complete enough, and is open to multiple interpretations. * Distraction - Attention is drawn away from the original task. * Fixation - Focusing on one item or detail to the exclusion of the big picture. * Overload - Too busy or overwhelmed to keep track of what's happening. * Complacency - A sense of comfort that can blind a crew member to approaching danger. * Improper Procedure - Operating outside of standard procedure without justification. * Unresolved Discrepancy - A failure to resolve conflicting information. \\"The GPS says Boston, but I don't see a city!\\". * Nobody Flying the Plane - Often cited as \\"self explanatory\\", a situation where nobody is properly in charge of operations. = Error management = Errors cannot always be prevented, but multiple \\"Barriers\\" can be used to stop a simple error from becoming a full on disaster.  Techniques  * Acknowledge that we are error prone - This does not excuse incompetence, it simple recognizes that anyone, at any time, can make a mistake, despite the best of intention and training. * Maximize barriers - Use redundancy, Standard Operating Procedures, and avoid being understaffed, so that one person's mistake does not grow to a major situation. * Communicate risks - Speak up about any source of danger, but also about anything that might prevent you from detecting an error, or might make you more likely to make an error, even if it has not yet led to any direct errors. * Follow SOPs - A study found that pilots ignoring an SOP had 1.6 times the risk of making another mistake. * Is this action SENSIBLE? - Think logically, not emotionally. Ask yourself questions about what might be lost and gained before committing to an action.  Case studies  =United Airlines Flight 173= United Airlines Flight 173 crew was making an approach to the Portland International Airport on the evening of Dec 28, 1978 when they experienced a landing gear abnormality. The captain decided to enter a holding pattern so they could troubleshoot the problem. The captain focused on the landing gear problem for an hour, ignoring repeated hints from the first officer and the flight engineer about their dwindling fuel supply. Only when the engines began flaming out did he realize their dire situation. They crash landed in a wooded suburb of Portland, Oregon, over six miles short of the runway. Of the 189 people aboard, two crewmembers and eight passengers died. The NTSB made several recommendations in their report including: The NTSB Air Safety Investigator who wrote this recommendation was aviation psychologist, Dr. Alan Diehl.[\\"Air Crash Investigation: Focused on Failure\\"] Discover Channel/National Geographic Program \\"Mayday\\" S12 E08 He was assigned to investigate this accident and realized it was similar to several other major airline accidents including the Eastern Airlines Lockheed-1011NTSB report: Eastern Airlines, Inc, L-1011, N310EA, Miami, Florida, December 29, 1972, NTSB (report number AAR-73/14), June 14, 1973 crash into the Everglades and the runway collision between Pan Am and KLM Boeing-747s at Tenerife.International Civil Aviation Organization,Circular 153-An/56, Mortreal, Canada, 1978) = United Airlines Flight 232 = Captain Al Haynes, pilot of United Airlines Flight 232, credits Crew Resource Management as being one of the factors that saved his own life, and many others, in the Sioux City, Iowa, crash of July 1989: = Air France 447 = One analysis blames failure to follow proper crew resource management procedures as being a contributing factor that led to the 2009 fatal crash into the Atlantic of Air France Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Following resolution of an earlier incident with a faulty pitot tube that lasted a few minutes, the pilot-in-command left to take a rest break, leaving control in the hands of the copilots. When the two copilots were operating the Airbus around 02:11:21, it was not clear which one of the two was in charge of the plane, nor did the copilots communicate with each other about who was in control of the plane. Following recovery of the black box two years later, various independent analyses were published, both before and after the official report was issued by the BEA, France's air safety board. One was a French report in the book \\"Erreurs de Pilotage\\" written by Jean-Pierre Otelli which leaked the final minutes of recorded cockpit conversation. On December 6, 2011, Popular Mechanics published an analysis of the accident including a translation of the leaked conversation accompanied by a step-by-step commentary. Speaking about the actions of the two copilots in the cockpit in the minutes before the aircraft crashed into the ocean, the article commentary says: > The men are utterly failing to engage in an important process known as crew > resource management, or CRM. They are failing, essentially, to cooperate. It > is not clear to either one of them who is responsible for what, and who is > doing what. = First Air Flight 6560 = The Canadian Transportation Safety Board determined that failure of Crew Resource Management was in large part responsible for the crash of First Air Flight 6560, a Boeing 737-200, in Resolute, Nunavut on 20 August 2011. A malfunctioning compass gave the crew an incorrect heading, although the Instrument Landing System and Global Positioning System indicated they were off course. The first officer made several attempts to indicate the problem to the captain, and suggested making a go-around several times during the approach, however failure to follow airline procedures and a lack of a standardized communication protocol to indicate a problem led to the captain dismissing the first officer's warnings. Both pilots were also overburdened with making preparations to land, resulting in neither being able to pay full attention to what was happening. First Air increased the time dedicated to Crew Resource Management in their training as a result of the accident, and the TSB recommended that regulatory bodies and airlines work to standardize CRM procedures and training in Canada. = Qantas Flight 32 = The success of the Qantas Flight 32 flight has been attributed to teamwork and CRM skills. Susan Parson, the editor of the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) Safety Briefing wrote: > Clearly, the QF32 crew‚Äôs performance was a bravura example of the > professionalism and airmanship every aviation citizen should aspire to > emulate. Carey Edwards, author of Airmanship wrote: > Their crew performance, communications, leadership, teamwork, workload > management, situation awareness, problem solving and decision making > resulted in no injuries to the 450 passengers and crew. QF32 will remain as > one of the finest examples of airmanship in the history of aviation. Adoption in related fields The basic concepts and ideology that make CRM successful with aviation air crews have also proven successful with other related career fields. Several commercial aviation firms, as well as international aviation safety agencies, began expanding CRM into air traffic control, aircraft design, and aircraft maintenance in the 1990s. Specifically, the aircraft maintenance section of this training expansion gained traction as Maintenance Resource Management (MRM). In an effort to standardize the industry wide training of this team-based safety approach, the FAA (U.S.) issued Advisory Circular 120-72, Maintenance Resource Management TrainingFAA AC 120-72: http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/3e5ec461ecf6f5e886256b4300703ad1/$FILE/AC%20120-72.pdf in September 2000. Following a study of aviation mishaps over the 10-year period 1992-2002, the United States Air Force determined that close to 18% of its aircraft mishaps were directly attributable to maintenance human error.U.S. Air Force Safety Center, 2003: https://web.archive.org/web/20030624092721/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=153 Unlike the more immediate impact of air crew error, maintenance human errors often occurred long before the flight where the problems were discovered. These \\"latent errors\\" included such mistakes as failure to follow published aircraft manuals, lack of assertive communication among maintenance technicians, poor supervision, and improper assembly practices. In 2005, to specifically address these maintenance human error-induced root causes of aircraft mishaps, Lt Col Doug Slocum, Chief of Safety at the Air National Guard's 162nd Fighter Wing, Tucson, AZ, directed that the base's CRM program be modified into a military version of MRM. In mid-2005, the Air National Guard Aviation Safety Division converted Slocum's MRM program into a national program available to the Air National Guard's flying wings, spread across 54 U.S. states and territories. In 2006, the Defense Safety Oversight Council (DSOC) of the U.S. Department of Defense recognized the mishap prevention value of this maintenance safety program by partially funding a variant of ANG MRM for training throughout the U.S. Air Force. This ANG initiated, DoD-funded version of MRM became known as Air Force Maintenance Resource Management, AF- MRM, and is now widely used in the U.S. Air Force.Air Force MRM: The Rail Safety Regulators Panel of Australia has adapted CRM to rail as Rail Resource Management, and developed a free kit of resources. Operating train crews at the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in the United States are instructed on CRM principles during yearly training courses. Crew resource management has been adopted by merchant shipping worldwide. The STCW Convention and STCW Code, 2017 edition STCW Including 2010 Manila Amendments, 2017 Edition. Published by the International Maritime Organization Pages 104 and 145 published by the I.M.O. states the requirements for Bridge Resource Management and Engine Room Resource Management training. These are approved shore based training or simulator training or approved in service experience. Most maritime colleges now hold courses for deck and engine room officers. Refresher courses are held every five years. Together these are referred to as Maritime Resource Management. Firefighting application Following the successes experienced in the aviation community, Crew Resource Management (CRM) was identified as a potential safety improvement program for the fire services. Specifically, Ted Putnam, Ph.D., wrote a paper that applied CRM concepts to the tragic and violent deaths of 14 Wildland firefighters on the South Canyon Fire in Colorado. From this paper a movement was initiated in the Wildland and Structural Fire Services to apply the Aviation CRM concepts to emergency response situations. Various programs have since been developed to train emergency responders in these concepts and to help track where breakdowns occur in these stressful environments. The International Association of Fire Chiefs published its first CRM manual for the fire service in 2001. It is currently in its third edition. In addition, several industry- specific textbooks have been published. Healthcare Elements of CRM have been applied in U.S. healthcare since the late 1990s, specifically in infection prevention. For example, the so-called \\"central line bundle\\" of best practices recommends using a checklist when inserting a central venous catheter. Unlike in the cockpit the observer checking off the checklist is usually lower-ranking than the person inserting the catheter. The observer is encouraged to communicate when elements of the bundle are not executed (for example, a breach in sterility has occurred).Institute for Healthcare improvement.

Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections, 2011. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/bsi- guidelines-2011.pdf, retrieved 7-18-13 = TeamSTEPPS = A division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), also provides training based in CRM principles to healthcare teams at no cost. This training, called TeamSTEPPS (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety), and the program is currently being implemented in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and primary care clinics around the world.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research; http://teamstepps.ahrq.gov/aboutnationalIP.htm Specifically TeamSTEPPs was designed to improve patient safety by teaching healthcare providers how better collaborate with each other by using various tools such as huddles, debriefs, handoffs, and check-backs. Implementing TeamSTEPPS has been shown to improve patient safety. Although there have been attempts to implement TeamSTEPPS in settings around the world, there is evidence to suggest that TeamSTEPPS interventions are difficult to implement and are not universally effective. However, there are strategies that healthcare leaders can use to improve their chance of implementation success, such as using coaching, supporting, empowering and supporting behaviors.

They were built as two flotillas, known as the 5th and 6th Emergency Flotilla, and they served as fleet and convoy escorts in World War II. Design features The S class introduced the CP (central pivot) Mark XXII mounting for the QF Mark IX 4.7 in guns. This new mounting had a shield with a sharply raked front, to allow increased elevation (to 55 degrees), contrasting noticeably with the vertical front of the previous CP Mark XVIII, and easily differentiated the S class onwards from their immediate predecessors. Savage was the exception in this respect, being fitted with four 4.5 in guns; a twin mounting forward and two singles aft. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer. The quadruple mounting Mark VII for the QF 2-pounder pom-poms was replaced by the twin mounting Mark IV for the 40 mm Bofors gun. Known as the \\"Hazemeyer\\" (or \\"Haslemere\\"), this advanced mounting was tri-axially stabilised in order that a target could be kept in the sights on the pitching deck of a destroyer and was fitted with an analog fire control computer and Radar Type 282, a metric range-finding set. The Hazemeyer design had been brought to Britain by the Dutch minelayer Willem van der Zaan that had escaped from the German occupation in May 1940. The T class also was the first class to replace pole or tripod forecasts with lattice masts, which continued in subsequent War Emergency Flotillas.

Its toponym is derived from the River Cherwell beside which the village stands. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population (including Fawsley) as 220. The present village, formerly called Upper or Over Charwelton, is where the main road between Daventry and Banbury, now the A361 road, crosses the river. The parish church is almost southeast at Church Charwelton, which is a hamlet and deserted medieval village. The Way long distance footpath between Banbury and Stamford passes through both Church Charwelton and Upper Charwelton. Manor There were several small manors in the parish. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the largest as being two hides and \\"four-fifths of half a hide\\" held by one Ralf of Robert, Count of Mortain. In the 12th century this manor was recorded as two hides and four \\"small virgates\\" in the fee of Berkhamsted. (There were 10 \\"small virgates\\" to a hide.) Thorney Abbey had an estate at Charwelton: the Domesday Book records it has half a hide; in the 12th century it was recorded as four small virgates. Domesday records William de Cahagnes holding half a hide at Charwelton of the Count of Mortain; in the 12th century Hugh de Chaham held the same half hide of the fee of the Earl of Leicester. Domesday records that Hugh de Grandmesnil held one virgate at Charwelton; in the 12th century this estate was recorded as four small virgates held of the Earl of Leicester. Also in the 12th century there was an estate of four small virgates in the fee of Adam de Napton. At the end of the 12th century William and Ralf de Cheinduit granted a manor at Charwelton to the Cistercian Biddlesden Abbey in Buckinghamshire. The Abbey retained the manor until it was forced to surrender all its properties to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Charwelton Manor House contains much early 16th century panelling, an early 17th-century fireplace and a late 17th-century staircase. It is an ironstone building of two storeys with a hipped roof. Its present fa√ßade of five bays was added probably early in the 18th century. Parish church The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity is at Church Charwelton. Its earliest features include the west windows of the south aisle, which are a stepped trio of lancet windows from about 1300. Holy Trinity has both a south and a north aisle, and the latter has a Decorated Gothic three-bay arcade. The west tower also is Decorated Gothic. The south porch is Perpendicular Gothic and the font may be 15th century. The chancel was largely rebuilt in 1901‚Äì04. Holy Trinity is a Grade I listed building. Holy Trinity contains a series of monuments to the Andrewe or Andrewes family. Several family members who died late in the 15th or early in the 16th century are commemorated by monumental brasses. The largest are a pair long representing Thomas Andrewe (died 1496) and his wife. From the latter half of the 16th century are two carved stone monuments. A tomb-chest bears recumbent effigies of Sir Thomas Andrew (died 1564) and his two successive wives, while a well-carved relief in fine white stone commemorates Thomas Andrew (died 1590) and his family. The church interior also includes decoration by the artist Henry Bird of Northampton. The church tower has a ring of five bells. Thomas I Newcombe, whose bell-foundry may have been in Leicester, cast the fourth bell in 1510. Hugh II Watts, who had foundries in Leicester and Bedford, cast the tenor bell in 1630. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the treble bell in 1716. John Taylor & Son of Loughborough cast the current second and third bells in 1844. Holy Trinity parish is part of the Benefice of Badby with Newnham and Charwelton with Fawsley and Preston Capes, which was formed in 1991. Economic and social history Charwelton's medieval packhorse bridge Charwelton's earliest surviving crossing over the river is a narrow packhorse bridge at Upper Charwelton, only wide between parapets. It has two arches and one cutwater, and may be 15th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. The Nomina Villarum of 1316 records Church Charwelton by name, but in 1491 John Rous recorded that it was in danger of being depopulated and in 1791 John Bridges recorded that much of its population had gone. Bridges claimed the Wars of the Roses in the late 15th century had caused this, but modern scholarship identifies the Andrewes family's sheep farming as the cause. In 1417 the merchant Thomas Andrews bought a small estate at Charwelton, and later he and his son, also called Thomas, leased much land in the parish. By 1547 a third Thomas Andrews was keeping 1,200 sheep here and two other landholders kept 500 and 300 respectively. North of Upper Charwelton, between the village and Charwelton Hall, are the earthworks of an abandoned part of the village. Just west of Charwelton Hall are traces of former ponds dug beside the Cherwell. They are recorded as having been fish ponds, but they had artificial islands in them that suggests they were made for wild fowl. Former post office in Church Street The parish's common fields were enclosed by agreement in 1531. Much of the ridge and furrow pattern of the common fields is still visible, and is best preserved along the Cherwell valley. Earthworks of the former village survive on all sides of the parish church and manor house, most of them to the southeast. South and west of the manor house are the remains of a set of Medieval fish ponds that were fed by the river. There are three mounds in the parish that are the sites of former windmills. One is on a hill above sea level, east of the present village and just east of the trackbed of the former railway line. Another is on Charwelton Hill, above sea level and southwest of the village beside the road to Byfield. The third is on a slight hill above sea level and about mile south of Charwelton. tank engine Charwelton pulled ironstone trains from a quarry near Hellidon to Charwelton railway station from 1917 until 1942 The Great Central Main Line from to London Marylebone was built through the parish in the 1890s and opened in March 1899. The line crossed the river between Charwelton and Church Charwelton. Charwelton railway station was built just east of the packhorse bridge. Just south of the village were Charwelton Watertroughs. British Railways closed Charwelton station in March 1963 and the line in September 1966. From 1917 until 1961 the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company had a quarry at Cherwell Farm northwest of Charwelton village, on the northern boundary with the parish of Hellidon. From there it ran a mineral railway down the Cherwell valley to bring ironstone to the main line at Charwelton station. A tank engine called Charwelton was built for the line in 1917, worked it until 1942, and is now preserved on the Kent and East Sussex Railway. Charwelton had a post office in Church Street. This has now closed and been turned back into a private home. Amenities The Fox and Hounds in 2006 Charwelton has a public house, the Fox and Hounds. It closed in 2012 and in September 2013 it was sold to a property company, Family Housing Ltd of Kettering. But the company gave the village until the end of October 2013 to buy it, and villagers raised enough capital to found a co-operative society, buy the Fox and Hounds and reopen it. It is now a Gastro Pub run by David and Sarah. From their experience with top clients within the London area, they decided to bring these delights to the village area. Their dedication and hard work has resulted with some top awards, including the Michelin Guide, Best Pub Awards, to name but a few.

Sedgebrook Grange was designed by architect John Brown and built in 1930 as a wedding gift for a member of the Houison Craufurd family from Craufurdland Castle in Ayrshire. The (Red) Earl Spencer broke the neck of his favourite horse, Merry Tom, whilst out fox hunting and trying to jump the narrow River Nene. The Earl paid for a monument to be erected at the Brixworth end of what is now known as Merry Tom Lane, engraved 'Here Lies the body of Merry Tom'. A local wag scratched on it: \\"ridden to death by careless John\\". Merry Tom Lane was also the site of a level crossing. When the railway is rebuilt a small halt will be built there. =Preserved railway= The nearby railway line is now part of the preserved Northampton & Lamport Railway which has its headquarters at Pitsford and Brampton railway station.

Early life Malanga was born in the Bronx in 1943, the only child of Italian immigrant parents. In 1959, at the beginning of his senior year at the School of Industrial Art\\"Gerard Malanga - David R. Godine, Publisher\\" in Manhattan, Malanga became a regular on Alan Freed's The Big Beat, televised on Channel 5 (WNEW) in New York City. He graduated from high school with a major in Advertising Design (1960). He was introduced to poetry by his senior class English teacher, poet Daisy Aldan, who had a profound influence on his life and work from then on. He enrolled at the University of Cincinnati's College of Art & Design (1960), and was mentored by the poet, Richard Eberhart who was the university's resident poet for 1961. He dropped out at the end of the Spring semester. In the fall of 1961, Malanga was admitted to Wagner College in Staten Island on a fellowship anonymously donated for the express purpose of advancing his creative abilities as a poet and artist. At Wagner he befriended one of his English professors, Willard Maas, and his wife Marie Menken, who became his mentors. In June 1963, he went to work for Andy Warhol as \\"a summer job that lasted seven years,\\" as he likes to put it. Malanga dropped out of Wagner College in 1964, freeing him up to work for Warhol full-time. Andy Warhol and The Factory Gerard Malanga worked closely for Andy Warhol during Warhol's most creative period, from 1963 to 1970. A February 17, 1992 article in The New York Times referred to him as \\"Andy Warhol's most important associate.\\" Malanga was involved in all phases of Warhol's creative output in silkscreen painting and filmmaking. He acted in many of the early Warhol films, including Kiss (1963), Harlot (1964), Soap Opera (1964), Couch (1964), Vinyl (1965), Camp (1965), Chelsea Girls (1966); and co-produced Bufferin (1967) in which he reads his poetry, deemed to be the longest spoken-word movie on record at 33-minutes nonstop. Malanga played a combination of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby in Warhol's film Since (1966). Also in 1966, he choreographed the music of the Velvet Underground for Warhol's multimedia presentation, The Exploding Plastic Inevitable. In 1969, Malanga was one of the founding editors, along with Warhol and John Wilcock, of Interview magazine. In December 1970, Malanga left Warhol's studio to pursue his work in photography. Creative practice Malanga and Warhol collaborated on the nearly five-hundred individual 3-minute \\"Screen Tests,\\" which resulted in a selection for a book of the same name, published by Kulchur Press, in 1967. Neither Warhol or Malanga were photographers at the time. Thus, by virtue of their collaboration with the motion picture medium, creating in what amounted to post-photographs, they became professional photographers. Malanga's photography spans over four decades and encompasses portraits, nudes and the urban documentation of \\"New York's Changing Scene,\\" a phrase which he adapted from Margot Gayle, an architectural historian and advocate, whose Sunday News column of the same name had a direct bearing on the development of his photographic eye. Malanga has always sought someone who was rarely photographed or placed in situations and surroundings unique to the pictures he was shooting. Within the first six years of taking pictures he managed to create three of the most prominent portraits of post-modern photography: Charles Olson for the interview he made with Olson for The Paris Review (1969); Iggy Pop nude in the penthouse apartment they shared one summer weekend (1971); and William Burroughs in front of the corporate headquarters that bears his family name (1975). All in all, he has photographed and archived hundreds of poets and artists over the years. He is also a photographer of a number of firsts, including Herbert Gericke, the last farmer of Staten Island (1981); and Jack Kerouac's typewritten roll for On the Road (1983). In his introduction to Malanga's first monograph, Resistance to Memory (Arena Editions, 1998), Ben Maddow, distinguished photo historian and poet had this to say: \\"Malanga has that great essential virtue of the photographer: humility before the complex splendor of the real thing‚Ä¶ Malanga is the photo- historian of this culture.\\" In reviewing Malanga's groundbreaking book two years later, Screen Tests Portraits Nudes 1964-1996 (Steidl), Fred McDarrah remarked that \\"Malanga is among the elite editors and photographers who have long dazzled and propelled the New York avant garde.\\" During the course of his years working with Warhol and after, Malanga shot and produced twelve films of his own. His personal archive contains still and motion-picture records of life at The Factory.

The park is named after Hard Labor Creek, a small stream that cuts through the park. The creek's name comes either from slaves who once tilled the summer fields, or from Native Americans who found the area around the stream difficult to ford. The park plays host to an 18-hole public golf course, which offers a pro shop, driving range, rental cars, and senior citizen discounts. Rocky Creek provides many of the water hazards on the course including the 14th hole with its signature water wheel. General information Hard Labor Creek State Park is a 24-hour passable by way of paved local surface roads non-gated state park. It is the home of two group camps, Camp Rutledge and Camp Daniel Morgan, both centered on the Lake Rutledge. A second lake, Lake Brantley, occupies the northwestern area of the park. This lake was named for a Brantley family killed by Native Americans in 1813. Both the camps and the lakes were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Daniel Morgan, was the filming location of four movies, Summer of My German Soldier (1978), Little Darlings (1980), Poison Ivy (1985), and Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986). Kristy McNichol starred in the first two. Cynthia Nixon of Sex and the City fame, who played \\"Sunshine\\" in Little Darlings returned to the nearby town of Rutledge, Georgia in 2005 to film a part in the Emmy winning movie Warm Springs; a part in which she too was nominated for an Emmy award. Camp Rutledge is also the location of the long-running summer camp for the youth of Peachtree Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, Georgia, the largest Presbyterian Church (USA) in the United States. Camp Rutledge is also used by the youth of Roswell Presbyterian Church. Hard Labor Creek State Park is the location of Hard Labor Creek Observatory; a facility of Georgia State University, Atlanta Georgia. Camp Rutledge was leased for many years by the Atlanta Jewish Community Center during the 1950s up through 1962 as a site for its summer camp program serving Jewish youth from the Atlanta area as well as the southern United States. Its use by the AJCC was ended with the acquisition and development of Camp Barney Medintz near Cleveland, Georgia. The Camp Rutledge facilities were recently examined by the TAPS Ghost Hunters team to see if the camp and the surrounding forest is haunted by nature spirits.Ghost hunters episode The park was temporarily utilized as an isolation and monitoring site for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with no place to self-quarantine. Only two patients stayed at the site, before a new site was opened at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center outside of Forsyth on March 24.

It trades as Carphone Warehouse in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and as Phone House elsewhere. Since 7 August 2014 the company has been a subsidiary of Dixons Carphone, which was formed by the merger of its former parent Carphone Warehouse Group with Dixons Retail. Prior to this merger, Carphone Warehouse Group was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History The company was co-founded in 1989 by Sir Charles Dunstone and Julian Brownlie, who put ¬£6,000 into the company from their savings. Guy Johnson of NEC UK became the third partner at the company, later taking up the role of Logistics and Distribution director. In 1990, Dunstone brought in his school friend David Ross, a chartered accountant, who became Chief Operating Officer in the same year. In January 1999, the company bought Tandy's operations in the United Kingdom for ¬£9 million. In July 2000, Carphone Warehouse issued an IPO. In July 2001, Johnson sold the majority of his stake and retired. Carphone Warehouse bought Opal Telecom in November 2002. In 2003, Ross started to step down from the COO role. In July 2005, he became deputy chairman. On 10 October 2006, the Carphone Warehouse announced that it would purchase the Internet access business of AOL in the United Kingdom for ¬£370m. Also in that month, it was announced that Geek Squad would be launching in the United Kingdom, in a 50/50 joint venture between Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy.Durman, P. \\"Geek Squad comes to Britain\\", The Sunday Times. Retrieved on 4 April 2007. In May 2008, Best Buy agreed to buy a 50% share in Carphone Warehouse's retail business for ¬£1.1 billion, to launch the Best Buy Europe joint venture, named CPW Europe. Best Buy and Carphone Warehouse also opened joint venture stores in the United States. Ross, by now a non-executive director, resigned from the board in December 2008. = 2010 to present = In 2010, the broadband and home phone business was spun off as TalkTalk. In May 2014, Carphone Warehouse Group and Dixons Retail announced their merger to create Dixons Carphone. The merger completed on 7 August 2014. The Dixons Group staff moved into 1 Portal Way, the original home of Carphone Warehouse, in North London in May 2015. In May 2015, Carphone Warehouse launched iD Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator using Three's network. In March 2020, the company announced that they would be closing all 531 stand-alone UK stores the following month. It was said that this measure was a result of the changing mobile market. In April 2020, products and services from the O2 network ceased to be available from Carphone Warehouse after the companies were unable to reach a contractual agreement.Former Carphone Warehouse Group plc logo in use until merger of 2014 with Dixons Retail plc =Demergers= On 8 May 2009, Carphone Warehouse agreed to pay ¬£236m in cash for the United Kingdom assets of Tiscali, an Italian telecoms group.

Marketing and sponsorship  =The X Factor= On 19 June 2007, the Carphone Warehouse became the official sponsor of the fourth series of The X Factor. The sponsorship deal was to last for three years. The Carphone Warehouse also became the sponsor of its spin off show, The Xtra Factor. After the Carphone Warehouse and TalkTalk split, TalkTalk took over the sole sponsorship of The X Factor. =Big Brother= The company were the sponsors for the United Kingdom's version of Big Brother from 2004 to 2007. In 2006, they also sponsored Celebrity Big Brother and related Celebrity Big Brother shows on Channel 4. On 17 January 2007, in response to alleged racism in Celebrity Big Brother, Charles Dunstone said: \\"We are talking to Channel 4. The sponsorship is constantly under review. Clearly we are against racism. Most people understand that the person who has their name associated with the programme does not necessarily condone the content.\\" On 18 January 2007, Carphone Warehouse announced that it had suspended its sponsorship of the show as Channel 4 had not taken sufficient action in response to the alleged racism in the show. On 8 March 2007, the company permanently dropped its sponsorship of the show. =Appys Awards= In April 2011, Carphone Warehouse sponsored the Appy Awards, calling them \\"the United Kingdom‚Äôs first major app awards ceremony designed to recognise innovation and development in app technology\\". Charity support In October 2001, Carphone Warehouse established a corporate partnership with Get Connected UK, a confidential helpline service for young people, that continues today. Carphone Warehouse supplies Get Connected with office and helpline equipment and has been instrumental in ensuring it is free to call from all landlines and mobiles. This partnership won the Charity Times Corporate Partnership Award in 2003 and the Third Sector Excellence Award for Corporate Partnership in 2006.

It is one of the largest species in the diverse Australasian honeyeater family Meliphagidae, and one of two living species of that family found in New Zealand, the other being the New Zealand bellbird (Anthornis melanura). The tui has a wide distribution in the archipelago, ranging from the subtropical Kermadec Islands to the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, as well as the main islands.  Name  The bird's common name tui comes from the MƒÅori language. The plural is tui in modern English, or ngƒÅ t≈´ƒ´ in MƒÅori usage; some speakers still use the '-s' suffix to produce the Anglicised form tuis to indicate plurality, but this practice is becoming less common. Early European colonists called it the parson bird or mockingbird; however, these names are no longer used.  Description  Adult and young tui (A History of the Birds of New Zealand, Buller, 1888) The tui is a large honeyeater, in length. The Chatham Islands subspecies is larger on average than the nominate subspecies, and heavier. Males tend to be heavier than females. Nominate males weigh between , and females . Males of the Chatham subspecies are and females . At first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch, causing it to resemble a parson in clerical attire. On closer inspection (see image) it can be seen that tui have brown feathers on the back and flanks, a multicoloured iridescent sheen that varies with the angle from which the light strikes them, and a dusting of small, white-shafted feathers on the back and sides of the neck that produce a lacy collar.  Distribution and habitat  Tui are native to New Zealand. Tui are found through much of New Zealand, particularly the North Island, the west and south coasts of the South Island, Stewart Island/Rakiura and the Chatham Islands‚Äîwhere an endangered sub-species particular to these islands exists. Other populations live on Raoul Island in the Kermadecs,C. R. Veitch, C. M. Miskelly, G. A. Harper, G. A. Taylor, and A. J. D. Tennyson (2004) \\"Birds of the Kermadec Islands, South-west Pacific\\" Notornis 51(2): 61‚Äì90 and in the Auckland Islands (where, with the New Zealand bellbird, it is the most southerly species of honeyeater).Department of Conservation (1999) New Zealand's Subantarctic Islands. Reed Books: Auckland Populations have declined considerably since European settlement, mainly as a result of widespread habitat destruction and predation by mammalian invasive species. Nonetheless, the species is considered secure and has made recoveries in some areas, particularly after removal of livestock has allowed vegetation to recover. Predation by introduced species remains a threat, particularly brushtail possums (which eat eggs and chicks), cats, stoats, the common myna (which competes with tui for food and sometimes takes eggs), blackbirds, and rats. Tui prefer broadleaf forests at low altitudes, although have been recorded up to 1500 metres.Higgins, P., L. Christidis, and H. Ford (2020). \\"Tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), version 1.0.\\" In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.tui1.01 It will tolerate quite small remnant patches, regrowth, exotic plantations and well-vegetated suburbs. They are one of the most common birds found in urban Wellington. They are usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups, but will congregate in large numbers at suitable food sources, often in company with silvereyes, bellbirds, or kerer≈´ (New Zealand wood pigeon) in any combination. Generally, when interspecific competition for the same food resources among New Zealand's two species of honeyeater occurs, there is a hierarchy with the tui at the top and bellbirds subordinate. The latter are thus frequently chased off by tui at a food source such as a flowering flax plant.  Behaviour and ecology  Tui defending a food source from a much larger kaka parrot Male tui can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds (large and small) from their territory with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. This is especially true of other tui when possession of a favoured feeding tree is impinged. Birds will often erect their body feathers in order to appear larger in an attempt to intimidate a rival. They have even been known to mob harriers and magpies. The powered flight of tui is quite loud as they have developed short wide wings, giving excellent maneuverability in the dense forest they prefer, but requiring rapid flapping. They can be seen to perform a mating display of rising at speed in a vertical climb in clear air, before stalling and dropping into a powered dive, then repeating. Much of this behaviour is more notable during the breeding season of early spring‚ÄîSeptember and October. Females alone build nests of twigs, grasses and mosses. = Feeding = Feeding on flax nectar Nectar is the normal diet but fruit and insects are frequently eaten, and pollen and seeds more occasionally. Particularly popular is the New Zealand flax, whose nectar sometimes ferments, resulting in the tui flying in a fashion that suggests that they might be drunk. They are the main pollinators of flax, kowhai, kaka beak and some other plants. Note that the flowers of the three plants mentioned are similar in shape to the tui's beak‚Äîa vivid example of mutualistic coevolution. = Songs and calls = Feathers fluffed up and loudly crying This short video includes vocalizations. Tui have a complex variety of songs and calls, much like parrots.Tui one of the world's most intelligent birds , 3 News. accessed 2012-10-16.

Tui are also known for their noisy, unusual call, different for each individual, that combine bellbird-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds. Songbirds have a bifurcated sound producing organ called a syrinx. Passerines like the tui have additional muscles giving them the ability to produce complex vocalisations. Tui song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation.S. D.

Often referred to as \\"Bobby\\" by others, he preferred and always used \\"Robert\\". Frankel set the single-season world record for most Grade/Group I victories in 2003 with 25 Grade I wins, a record that stood until it was beaten by Aidan O'Brien in 2017. Early life and education Frankel was born July 9, 1941 to a Jewish family in Brooklyn,Bloodhorse: \\"Hall of Famer Bobby Frankel Dies at 68\\" by Steve Haskin The Blood-Horse, November 18, 2009. the son of Merrill and Gertrude Frankel. His parents were in the catering business. His interest in horses was piqued when his parents took him to Belmont Park as a child. After high school, he enrolled at C.W. Post College on Long Island but soon quit after getting into a fight. Thereafter, he worked construction by day and gambled at the tracks by night, eventually volunteering as a hot walker so he could get a free pass to the evening races. Career Early in his career in 1960s New York City, Frankel assisted the prominent trainer Buddy Jacobson. On his own, Frankel saddled his first winner late in 1966http://www.NTRA.com before struggling somewhat in 1967, when he won with just 9 of 101 starters.The American Racing Manual, 1968 During 1968 however, he won 36 of 165 outings with his horses accumulating $167,000 in purse money.The American Racing Manual, 1969 In the next few years, he continued to prosper in New York and during the winter of 1970‚Äì71, he enjoyed some success at the West Coast meeting at Santa Anita. After moving permanently to California in 1972, Frankel scored a series of wins that brought him to the attention of the horse-betting world, winning a record 60 races at Hollywood Park. Many of those victories came with runners he acquired as low-cost claimers for one of his owners like Edmund Gann, with whom he had a 30-year working relationship. These horses typically showed dramatic improvement under his care, sometimes winning their next start against higher-priced claiming levels. Frankel was an avid follower of the training techniques of Charlie Whittingham, trainer of champions such as Ferdinand and Sunday Silence. Frankel won several Eclipse Awards, the year-end thoroughbred racing awards, for best trainer. He set earnings records, Grade I stakes victory records, and many others. Frankel also won the Pacific Classic Stakes a record six times, including four times in a row, also a record. Some of his best race horses include: Squirtle Squirt, his first Breeders' Cup winner; Skimming, two-time winner of the Grade 1 Pacific Classic Stakes; Sightseek, winner of the Humana Distaff Handicap (Gr. I) and Ogden Phipps Handicap (Gr. I); triple Grade I winner Empire Maker, winner of the Belmont Stakes (Gr. I); multiple Grade I winning Peace Rules; two-time Santa Anita Handicap (Gr. I) winner Milwaukee Brew; Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf (Gr. I) winner Starine, whom he also owned; and Ghostzapper, the Breeders' Cup Classic (Gr. I) winner who was voted the 2004 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. Frankel was the U.S. Champion Trainer by earnings in 2002 and 2003. On June 26, 2005, Wild Desert, owned by several businesspeople including former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, gave Frankel his first victory in the $1 million Queen's Plate, the first leg of the Canadian Triple Crown at Woodbine Racetrack.

In September 1957 when Sarit Thanarat seized power in a military coup, he appointed Pote to be the acting prime minister. He resigned in December 1957. Pote also served as the first Secretary General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization from September 1957 until 1964. Education Pote Sarasin came from an old family of merchants and landowners.

Designed by Adolph Weinman and also referred to as the Winged Liberty Head dime, it gained its common name because the obverse depiction of a young Liberty, identifiable by her winged Phrygian cap, was confused with the Roman god Mercury. Weinman is believed to have used Elsie Stevens, the wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens, as a model. The coin's reverse depicts a fasces, symbolizing unity and strength, and an olive branch, signifying peace. By 1916, the dime, quarter, and half dollar designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber had been struck for 25 years, and could be replaced by the Treasury, of which the Mint is a part, without Congressional authorization. Mint officials were under the misapprehension that the designs had to be changed, and held a competition among three sculptors, in which Barber, who had been in his position for 36 years, also took part. Weinman's designs for the dime and half dollar were selected. Although the new coin's design was admired for its beauty, the Mint made modifications to it upon learning that vending machine manufacturers were having difficulties making the new dime work in their devices. The coin continued to be minted until 1945, when the Treasury ordered that a new design, featuring recently deceased president Franklin Roosevelt, take its place. The Mercury dime was minted again but in gold for its centenary in 2016.  Inception  On September 26, 1890, the United States Congress passed an act providing: The Barber coinage had been introduced in 1892; similar dimes, quarter dollars, and half dollars, all designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The introduction had followed a design competition to replace the Seated Liberty coinage, which had been struck since the 1830s. The Mint had offered only a small prize to the winner, and all invited artists refused to submit entries. The competition was open to the public, and the judging committee found no entry suitable. Mint Director Edward Leech responded to the failed competition by directing Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar. The Barber coinage, after its release, attracted considerable public dissatisfaction. Beginning in 1905, successive presidential administrations had attempted to bring modern, beautiful designs to United States coins. Following the redesign of the double eagle, eagle, half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908, as well as the cent and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively, advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins' minimum term expired in 1916. As early as 1914, Victor David Brenner, designer of the Lincoln cent, submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins. He was told in response that Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters. On January 2, 1915, an interview with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce appeared in the Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record: Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce decried the Lincoln cent and other new coinage, believing that they struck badly. Plaquette by George T. Morgan. In January 1915, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William P. Malburn sent McAdoo a memorandum about the silver subsidiary coinage, noting that \\"the present silver half dollar, quarter, and dime were changed in 1892, and a new design may, therefore, be adopted in 1916. This can be done any time in the year.\\" In reply, McAdoo wrote \\"[l]et the mint submit designs before we try anyone else.\\" on the memorandum. In April 1915, Robert W. Woolley took office as Mint Director. On April 14, he asked Superintendent Joyce to request Chief Engraver Barber, then in his 36th year in office, to prepare new designs. The same day, Malburn requested the opinion of the Treasury Department's Solicitor concerning the Mint view that it could strike new designs for the three denominations in 1916. On April 17, the Solicitor's Office responded that the Mint could change the designs. At the time, the Mint was intensely busy producing the Panama- Pacific commemorative coin issue, and immediate action was not taken. In October, Barber was summoned to Washington to discuss coin designs with Woolley, though it is uncertain whether or not he had already prepared sketches for the new coinage. On December 3, Woolley met with the Commission of Fine Arts. Woolley asked the Commission to view sketches produced by the Mint's engraving department. Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members. Woolley suggested to the members that if they did not like the Mint's work, they should select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces. It was Woolley's intent to have distinct designs for the dime, quarter and half dollar‚Äîpreviously, the three pieces had been near-identical. The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years, it would have to be changed‚Äîsomething which numismatic historian David Lange calls a \\"misinterpretation of the coinage laws\\". The Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint (submitted by Barber) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins. The sculptors could submit multiple sketches. Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor, the designs were not fully interchangeable‚Äîby statute, an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime. Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece. Mint Director Robert W. Woolley (seen on his Mint medal, designed by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan) advocated for the end of the Barber coinage, though he may not have understood he did not have to replace them. The three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid-February, and on February 23 met with Woolley in New York so the artists could make presentations of the work to him and answer his questions. After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on February 28 that five of his sketches had been selected‚Äîfor the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter's obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter, subject to his making modifications to his submission. On March 3, the new coins were publicly announced, with the Treasury noting, \\"[d]esigns of these coins must be changed by law every 25 years and the present 25 year period ends with 1916.\\" The press release indicated that the Treasury hoped production of the new coins would begin in about two months, once the designs were finalized. The same day, Woolley wrote to Mint Engraver Barber, telling him that his sketches were rejected, and that models from Weinman and MacNeil would arrive at the Philadelphia Mint no later than May 1. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Barber became \\"sullen and totally uncooperative\\". Lange notes that \\"numerous delays were encountered as the artists fine-tuned their models while simultaneously avoiding obstacles thrown in their path by Barber. While his observations regarding many aspects of practical coinage were quite accurate, they clearly could have been presented in a more constructive manner.\\" In his book on Mercury dimes, Lange notes that Barber, by then aged 75, had been \\"compelled over the past ten years to participate in the systematic undoing of a lifetime's achievements\\"; he had to participate in the process which resulted in coins designed by others replacing ones designed by him. With the new pieces, all American coins would have had a recent change of design (the Morgan dollar was not then being struck). According to a column in The Art World magazine later in 1916,  Design  Adolph Weinman is widely believed to have used his neighbor, Elsie Stevens, as the model for the Mercury dime. Weinman never disclosed the name of the model for the obverse, and no person ever claimed to have been her. The winged Liberty is widely believed, however, to have been based on a 1913 bust Weinman sculpted of Elsie Stevens, wife of Wallace Stevens. A lawyer and insurance executive, Wallace Stevens later became famous as a poet; Wallace and Elsie Stevens rented an apartment from Weinman from 1909 to 1916. In a draft of his unpublished autobiography, Woolley wrote that Weinman refused to name the model, but told him it was the wife of a lawyer who lived above his Manhattan apartment (Woolley, in a later version, omitted the location, saying only that Weinman said it was the wife of a lawyer friend). Woolley recorded that he was told that the model wore the top of an old pair of stockings to simulate the cap. In 1966, Holly Stevens, Wallace and Elsie's daughter, noted in her edition of her father's letters that Elsie had been the model for Weinman's dime and half dollar. Liberty's features also bear a resemblance to the face of Victory in Weinman's 1909 statuary group erected in Baltimore, the Union Soldiers and Sailors' Monument. Weinman's 1909 statue of Victory in Baltimore's Union Soldiers and Sailors' Monument has features said to bear a resemblance to those on the Mercury dime. Weinman's dime depicts Liberty with a wreath of tight curls, and wearing a traditional pileus, or Liberty cap. His depiction of the pileus as a winged cap has provoked comparisons with Roman Republic denarii, which art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered superficial. Weinman wrote that he considered the winged cap to symbolize \\"liberty of thought\\". Vermeule suggests that one reason for the use of wings was that Weinman, in common with many in the tradition of Augustus Saint- Gaudens, under whom Weinman had studied, liked the effect of feathers done in relief. The reverse depicts a fasces, the object carried by lictors, who accompanied Roman magistrates; on the coin it represents war and justice. It is contrasted with a large olive branch symbolizing peace. According to Breen, \\"Weinman's symbolic message in this design ... was clearly an updated 'Don't tread on me'\\". The fasces is bound both horizontally and diagonally by a leather strap, with the loose ends at the bottom. The lettering is in Roman style, and is made as discreet as possible. Weinman's monogram, AW, appears on the obverse, midway between the date and the letter Y in \\"LIBERTY\\". The mintmark is located on the reverse, to the right of the first E in \\"ONE DIME\\". Woolley described the design in his 1916 report to the Secretary of the Treasury:  Preparation  pattern of the 1916 Mercury dime as illustrated in that year's Mint Director's Report. Note that the head is further to the right of the coin than on the issued piece and the head covers less of the \\"E\\". Weinman's monogram is also absent. After Weinman's success in the competition, he visited the Mint to discuss conversion of his models to finished dies. The first time, he found Barber absent, but had a productive talk with long-time Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. Other visits followed, and on March 29, Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce, \\"confidentially, the sculptors designing the new coins felt that on their last trip Mr. Morgan was much more cordial and cooperative than Mr. Barber was. I realize I am dealing with artistic temperaments at both ends.\\" A severe case of tonsillitis delayed Weinman's work, and caused him to request an extension of the May 1 deadline. On May 29, Woolley wrote Weinman that the designs, both for the dime and half dollar, were accepted by the Mint. As no Barber pieces of any of the three denominations had been struck in 1916, the pent-up demand was high. On June 24, Woolley wrote to Joyce: Two days later, work on dies was stopped when it was decided that the lettering was insufficiently distinct. The delay, however, did not prevent the Mint from authorizing payment to Weinman for his designs. On July 15, Woolley resigned as Mint director to work as publicity chairman of the Wilson reelection campaign. As the new director, Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, did not take office until September 1, 1916, Fred H. Chaffin became acting director. With none of the new designs ready for production, and small change in great demand, the Mint had no alternative other than to strike Barber dimes and quarters by the million. After the lettering problems were addressed, Acting Director Chaffin halted production of Barber dimes on August 29, and ordered production of the Mercury dime to begin the following day at the Philadelphia Mint. Barber had prepared dies for the Denver and San Francisco mints, but they were still in transit. Small quantities of the new dime had been sent to vending machine and pay phone manufacturers; on September 6, two companies reported problems with the coins. AT&T; complained that the new dimes were too thick and would not work in their phones. American Sales Machines (owned by Clarence W. Hobbs, whose complaints had delayed the Buffalo nickel) requested design changes so that its counterfeit detector could work. Von Engelken ordered production of the dimes halted. In reality, the dime was not too thick, but the rim of the coin struck too high, a defect known as a \\"fin\\". This had been an ongoing problem as Weinman's design was produced, but was thought to have been corrected. No dimes had yet been struck at the two western mints. Minting of Barber dimes resumed. After an article quoting Joyce appeared in the press, Von Engelken instructed his staff not to speak to reporters. The problems with the dime were a potential embarrassment with a presidential campaign underway. McAdoo enquired how much time would be required for another design to be struck; he was informed it would take months. Instead, Weinman prepared modified designs, separating the letters of \\"LIBERTY\\" slightly from the rim, and lowering the relief. McAdoo approved the revised design on September 28. These changes assuaged the concerns of both firms. Von Engelken authorized Joyce to produce coinage dies on October 6, and the new coins were put into production. The earlier strikes, including those reclaimed from the testing companies, were melted, though one specimen is currently known to exist.  Release and production; name controversy  The 1916 United States Assay Commission met on February 9 and February 10, 1916, to test coins from the previous year to ensure they met specifications. Among the members and Mint officials shown were then-Mint Director Robert W. Woolley (standing fourth from left), Engraver of the United States Mint at Philadelphia Charles E. Barber (standing third from left) and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam Joyce (standing at far right). The Mercury dime was released into circulation on October 30, 1916, the same day that production of the Barber dime ceased. Several newspapers complained that Weinman's monogram was too prominent on the obverse; according to The New York Times, the Treasury was considering removal. On November 4, Weinman enquired of Joyce whether any removal was contemplated; he received in reply compliments on his design and Joyce's statement that the Mint was not responsible for what appeared in print. Weinman wrote again, hoping to make changes to the dime, but was told that only an act of Congress could change the design. Of the three circulating coins first struck in 1916, the Mercury dime was particularly praised. On the first day of circulation, quantities sold were limited at banks. One Minneapolis newspaper dubbed it the \\"battle ax\\" or \\"golf\\" dime, reflecting a lack of knowledge concerning the fasces. A letter to the editor in the January 1917 The Numismatist appears to be the first numismatic reference to the coin by the nickname \\"Mercury\\". Lange traced the history of this misnomer, Chief Engraver Barber died on February 18, 1917, having served 37 years in office. His successor was the 72-year-old Morgan, who had served under Barber for his entire tenure. The dime was struck in substantial numbers until 1930, with the notable exception of the 1916-D issue and from 1921 to 1923, when an economic downturn caused the need for coins to diminish. No dimes were struck for 1922, the first time since 1826 that this had occurred. With the onset of the Great Depression, mintages dropped again in 1930 and 1931; coinage of dimes was suspended entirely in 1932 and 1933. The low-mintage dates are not rare today as many were hoarded, and 1930- and 1931-dated dimes proved readily available from the banks once the economy improved. With the economy beginning to pick up again, coinage resumed in 1934, and the dime was struck in large numbers each year through the end of the series. The death of President Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945 brought immediate calls for a coin to be issued with his image. As Roosevelt had been closely associated with the March of Dimes, and as the dime's design could be replaced without the need for congressional action as it had been struck for more than 25 years, the Treasury chose that denomination to honor Roosevelt. Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, Morgan's successor, executed the design featuring Roosevelt, which replaced the Mercury dime in 1946, making 1945 the last year in which it was produced. According to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, a total of 2,677,232,488 Mercury dimes were struck.  Collecting  The Mint medal for Director Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, designed by George T. Morgan, who was then assistant engraver. The 1916-D Mercury dime, struck at the Denver Mint, is the key date of the series, with a mintage of 264,000 pieces. The low mintage is because in November 1916, von Engelken informed the three mint superintendents of a large order for quarters, and instructed that Denver strike only quarters until it was filled. Striking of dimes at Denver did not resume until well into 1917, making the 1917-D relatively rare as well. Few varieties are known in the Mercury dime series. The 1942/41 is generally termed an overdate; it is actually a doubled die error‚Äîthe obverse die from which the coins were struck took one impression from a 1942-dated hub and one from a 1941-dated hub (until the 1990s, dies required two strikes from a hub for the design to be fully impressed). Sinnock stated that the pieces were most likely struck in late 1941, when preparation of the 1942 dies was under way. Also produced at that time, though less apparent to the naked eye, was the 1942/1-D. Another popular variety is the 1945-S \\"Micro S\\", with a smaller-than-normal mintmark. This variety was caused by the Mint's wartime use of a puncheon (used to impress mintmarks on dies and hubs) which had been made for use with early 20th century Philippine coinage struck at San Francisco, which had only a small space for the mintmark. Beginning in 1928, coin albums were issued by private publishers, mostly in folder form, which were widely used to collect the pieces. This led to a great increase in interest in collecting current coinage by date and mintmark. Many Mercury dimes were not fully struck, meaning that design detail was lost even before the coins entered circulation. Exceptionally well-struck dimes display \\"full bands\\", that is, the horizontal bands on the fasces show full detail. In circulation, the reverse tended to more readily display wear due to a lower rim in relation to the relief of the design. Most well-circulated dimes show more wear to the reverse. Although no 1923 or 1930 dimes were struck at Denver, specimens appearing to be 1923-D or 1930-D dimes may be encountered. These counterfeits are struck in good silver, allowing the coiner to profit on the difference between the cost of production and the face value. They did not appear until after World War II, are invariably found in worn condition, and are believed to have been struck in the Soviet Union, a country known to have counterfeited US coins during World War II. = Project Mercury = Several Mercury dimes were flown into space on July 21, 1961, on the Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital mission, the second manned flight of Project Mercury and the second human space flight by the United States. The coins sank with the capsule in the Atlantic Ocean, but were later recovered with the capsule from a depth of nearly in 1999.  2016 centennial gold version  2016-W Gold Mercury dime The Mint released a centennial version, in gold, of the Mercury dime on April 21, 2016, sold through the Mint's official website. Demand was so high that orders were no longer able to be placed within 45 minutes of the coin becoming available. On April 26, the Mint reported that it had sold 122,510 units, just 2,490 pieces away from the item's maximum allowable mintage. The remainder, which included about as many as 8,000 to 9,000 coins that were unsold or returned to the mint from prior sales, were offered for sale on December 15, 2016, with a limit of one per customer, and sold out within 90 minutes.

LHS shows zero-level solution. RHS shows the level-set scalar field. Level-set methods (LSM) are a conceptual framework for using level sets as a tool for numerical analysis of surfaces and shapes. The advantage of the level-set model is that one can perform numerical computations involving curves and surfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid without having to parameterize these objects (this is called the Eulerian approach). Also, the level-set method makes it very easy to follow shapes that change topology, for example, when a shape splits in two, develops holes, or the reverse of these operations. All these make the level-set method a great tool for modeling time-varying objects, like inflation of an airbag, or a drop of oil floating in water. An illustration of the level-set method The figure on the right illustrates several important ideas about the level-set method. In the upper-left corner we see a shape; that is, a bounded region with a well-behaved boundary. Below it, the red surface is the graph of a level set function varphi determining this shape, and the flat blue region represents the xy plane. The boundary of the shape is then the zero-level set of varphi, while the shape itself is the set of points in the plane for which varphi is positive (interior of the shape) or zero (at the boundary). In the top row we see the shape changing its topology by splitting in two. It would be quite hard to describe this transformation numerically by parameterizing the boundary of the shape and following its evolution. One would need an algorithm able to detect the moment the shape splits in two, and then construct parameterizations for the two newly obtained curves. On the other hand, if we look at the bottom row, we see that the level set function merely translated downward. This is an example of when it can be much easier to work with a shape through its level-set function than with the shape directly, where using the shape directly would need to consider and handle all the possible deformations the shape might undergo. Thus, in two dimensions, the level-set method amounts to representing a closed curve Gamma (such as the shape boundary in our example) using an auxiliary function varphi, called the level-set function. Gamma is represented as the zero-level set of varphi by :Gamma = {(x, y) mid varphi(x, y) = 0 }, and the level-set method manipulates Gamma implicitly, through the function varphi. This function varphi is assumed to take positive values inside the region delimited by the curve Gamma and negative values outside. The level- set equation If the curve Gamma moves in the normal direction with a speed v, then the level-set function varphi satisfies the level-set equation :frac{partialvarphi}{partial t} = v abla varphi. Here, cdot is the Euclidean norm (denoted customarily by single bars in PDEs), and t is time. This is a partial differential equation, in particular a Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation, and can be solved numerically, for example, by using finite differences on a Cartesian grid. The numerical solution of the level-set equation, however, requires sophisticated techniques. Simple finite-difference methods fail quickly. Upwinding methods, such as the Godunov method, fare better; however, the level-set method does not guarantee the conservation of the volume and the shape of the level set in an advection field that does conserve the shape and size, for example, uniform or rotational velocity field. Instead, the shape of the level set may get severely distorted, and the level set may vanish over several time steps. For this reason, high-order finite-difference schemes are generally required, such as high-order essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes, and even then the feasibility of long-time simulations is questionable. Further sophisticated methods to deal with this difficulty have been developed, e.g., combinations of the level-set method with tracing marker particles advected by the velocity field.  Example  Consider a unit circle in mathbb{R}^2, shrinking in on itself at a constant rate, i.e. each point on the boundary of the circle moves along its inwards pointing normal at some fixed speed. The circle will shrink and eventually collapse down to a point. If an initial distance field is constructed (i.e. a function whose value is the signed euclidean distance to the boundary, positive interior, negative exterior) on the initial circle, the normalised gradient of this field will be the circle normal. If the field has a constant value subtracted from it in time, the zero level (which was the initial boundary) of the new fields will also be circular and will similarly collapse to a point. This is due to this being effectively the temporal integration of the Eikonal equation with a fixed front velocity. In combustion, this method is used to describe the instantaneous flame surface, known as the G equation. History The level-set method was developed in the 1980s by the American mathematicians Stanley Osher and James Sethian. It has become popular in many disciplines, such as image processing, computer graphics, computational geometry, optimization, computational fluid dynamics, and computational biophysics. A number of level-set data structures have been developed to facilitate the use of the level-set method in computer applications.  Applications  * Computational fluid dynamics * Combustion * Trajectory planning * Optimization * Image processing * Computational biophysics  Computational fluid dynamics  To run a Math Model in the interface of two different fluids we need to soften the interactions between the fluids. Therefore we need to apply a specific function: Compact Level Set Method. As an ‚Äúspin off‚Äù, the CompactLSM its a complement of the LSM, that helps solving LSM equations. It can be used in numerical simulation of flow, for example, if we are working with discretization of the interface water-air, compacts at sixth order, ensures the accurate and fast calculation of the interface equations (Monteiro 2018). The LSM uses a distance function to locate different fluids. A distance function is that whose value represents the smallest distance from the point where it is being analyzed to the interface. This distance function is identified by isolines (2D) or isosurfaces (3D), showing that the negative values refer to one of the fluids, positive values refer to the other and the zero value corresponds to the position of the interface. But, how Heaviside function its inserted in the Compact Level Set Method? Since the specific mass and viscosity are discontinuous at the interface, both excess diffusion problem (interface widening) and numerical oscillations are expected if there is no adequate treatment of the fluid near the interface. To minimize these problems, the Level Set method uses a smooth, cell-related Heaviside function that explicitly defines the interface position (‚àÖ = 0). The transition in the interface is kept smooth, but with a thickness of the order of magnitude of the cell size, to avoid the introduction of disturbances with a length scale equal to that of the mesh, since the interface infers an abrupt jump property from one cell to the next (Unverdi and Tryggvason, 1992). To reconstruct the material properties of the flow, such as specific mass and viscosity, another marker function, I (‚àÖ), of the Heaviside type is used: : I (varphi) = begin{cases} 0, & text{if }varphi<-deltaDelta [8pt] dfrac 1 2 left[ 1 + dfrac varphi {deltaDelta} + dfrac 1 pi sinleft( dfrac{pivarphi}{deltaDelta} right) right], & text{if } varphi leq deltaDelta [8pt] 1, & text{if }varphi>deltaDelta end{cases} (1) where Œ¥ is an empirical coefficient, usually equal to 1; 5 and Œî is the characteristic discretization of the problem, which varies according to the phenomenon to be simulated. The value of Œ¥ represents an interface with a thickness of three cells, and thus Œ¥Œî represents half the thickness of the interface. Note that in this method, the interface has a virtual thickness, as it is represented by a smooth function. Physical properties, such as specific mass and kinematic viscosity, are calculated as: : rho = (1-I)rho_1+Irho_2 qquad eqquad v=(1-I)v_1+Iv_2 (2) where œÅ1, œÅ2, v1 and v2 are the specific mass and kinematic viscosity of fluids 1 and 2. Equation 2 can be applied analogously to the other properties of the fluids.

In photography, backscatter (also called near- camera reflection) is an optical phenomenon resulting in typically circular artifacts on an image, due to the camera's flash being reflected from unfocused motes of dust, water droplets, or other particles in the air or water. It is especially common with modern compact and ultra-compact digital cameras. A hypothetical underwater instance with two conditions in which circular photographic artifacts are likely (A) and unlikely (B), depending on whether the aspect of particles facing the lens are directly reflect the flash, as shown. Elements are not shown to scale. Caused by the backscatter of light by unfocused particles, these artifacts are also sometimes called orbs, referring to a common paranormal claim. Some appear with trails, suggesting motion. Cause Circular unfocused visual artifacts caused by raindrops. Backscatter commonly occurs in low-light scenes when the camera's flash is used. Cases include nighttime and underwater photography, when a bright light source and reflective unfocused particles are near the camera. Light appears much brighter very near the source due to the inverse-square law, which says light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.Richard Ferncase. Basic Lighting Worktext for Film and Video. CRC Press; 22 April 1992. . p. 66. The artifact can result from the backscatter or retroreflection of the light from airborne solid particles, such as dust or pollen, or liquid droplets, especially rain or mist. They can also be caused by foreign material within the camera lens. The image artifacts usually appear as either white or semi-transparent circles, though may also occur with whole or partial color spectra, purple fringing or other chromatic aberration. With rain droplets, an image may capture light passing through the droplet creating a small rainbow effect.J. David Pye. Polarised Light in Science and Nature. CRC Press; 6 May 2015. . p. 81. Fujifilm describes the artifacts as a common photographic problem: In underwater scenes, particles such as sand or planktonic marine life near the lens, invisible to the diver, reflect light from the flash causing the orb artifact in the image. A strobe flash, which distances the flash from the lens, eliminates the artifacts.Nick Robertson- Brown. Underwater Photography: Art and Techniques. Crowood; 31 January 2014. . p. 105. The effect is also seen on infrared video cameras, where superbright infrared LEDs illuminate microscopic particles very close to the lens. The artifacts are especially common with compact or ultra-compact cameras, where the short distance between the lens and the built-in flash decreases the angle of light reflection toward the lens, directly illuminating the aspect of the particles facing the lens and increasing the camera's ability to capture the light reflected from normally subvisible particles. A single orb in the center of the photo, at the person's knee level Paranormal claims Some paranormal investigators have referred to orbs appearing in photographs from allegedly paranormal sources. Others have claimed that orbs are an unknown sort of being, based partly on perceived intent in the orbs' movements.

It is the largest air-to-air missile in the world to ever go into production. Development The development of the Mach 3+ North American XB-70 Valkyrie threatened to make the entire interceptor and missile force of the Voyska PVO obsolete at one stroke, thanks to its incredible speed and altitude performance. In order to counter this new threat, the MiG-25 was designed, but new air-to-air missiles were also required to enable the MiG-25 to engage its intended targets at the high speeds and altitudes dictated by the requirements. The Bisnovat design bureau began development of the long- range air-to-air missile in 1962. The resulting R-40 was initially matched with the Smerch-A (\\"Tornado-A\\") radar of the MiG-25. It was built in semi- active radar homing (R-40R), with inverse monopulse seeker which give the missile ability to engage targets in All-aspects and Infrared homing (R-40T) versions. In order to guarantee a kill at such high speeds and in the thin air, a large warhead was needed in order to have a sufficient blast effect. Large control fins were required to give the missile enough maneuvrability at high altitude. All this necessitated a very large missile and as a result, the R-40 is the largest air-to-air missile to ever enter production. It is slightly larger than the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile. Following the defection of Soviet Air Defence Forces pilot Viktor Belenko in 1976 and the compromising of the MiG-25P's systems and the associated R-40s, Vympel developed an improved version of the missile with a better infrared countermeasures (IRCM) resistance and more sensitive seekers. The upgraded missiles were designated with the suffix -D (for 'dorabotannye', \\"finalized\\"). Later -D1 versions were also developed. Production of the R-40 ended in 1991, but it remains in limited service arming surviving MiG-25 and some MiG-31 interceptors. Combat history In Soviet service, the R-40 was never fired in anger. Standard PVO procedure was to fire a 2-missile salvo at a target; 1 heat-seeking R-40T missile followed by a SARH R-40R, in order to avoid the possibility of the heat-seeking missile locking-on to the radar-guided missile. As the MiG-25 has been exported to various states in the Middle East, the R-40 has been used in combat by Iraq and probably by Syria and Libya too. Author Tom Cooper claims that Syrian Air Force achieved an air victory on 29 June 1981 when Syrian MiG-25PD ( unit 1 FIS SAF ) shot down an Israeli F-15. This has not been confirmed. A declassified document of the CIA reports that in the first night of Desert Storm, on 17 January 1991, Scott Speicher's F/A-18C was shot down by an R-40R fired from an Iraqi MiG-25. On 30 January 1991 a IRAF MiG-25 damaged a USAF F-15C by a R-40 missile in Sammura air battle. However Iraq claimed and later confirmed that the F-15 was shot down and fell in Saudi Arabia after a bedouin smuggler found wreckage but USAF debunks these claims.

Backscatter X-ray is an advanced X-ray imaging technology. Traditional X-ray machines detect hard and soft materials by the variation in x-ray intensity transmitted through the target. In contrast, backscatter X-ray detects the radiation that reflects from the target. It has potential applications where less-destructive examination is required, and can operate even if only one side of the target is available for examination. The technology is one of two types of whole-body imaging technologies that have been used to perform full- body scans of airline passengers to detect hidden weapons, tools, liquids, narcotics, currency, and other contraband. A competing technology is millimeter wave scanner. One can refer to an airport security machine of this type as a \\"body scanner\\", \\"whole body imager (WBI)\\", \\"security scanner\\" or \\"naked scanner\\". Deployments at airports In the United States, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required that all full-body scanners operated in airports by the Transportation Security Administration use \\"Automated Target Recognition\\" software, which replaces the picture of a nude body with the cartoon-like representation. As a result of this law, all backscatter X-ray machines formerly in use by the Transportation Security Administration were removed from airports by May 2013, since the agency said the vendor (Rapiscan) did not meet their contractual deadline to implement the software.. In the European Union, backscatter X-ray screening of airline passengers was banned in 2012 to protect passenger safety. Technology Backscatter technology is based on the Compton scattering effect of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation. Unlike a traditional X-ray machine, which relies on the transmission of X-rays through the object, backscatter X-ray detects the radiation that reflects from the object and forms an image. The backscatter pattern is dependent on the material property and is good for imaging organic material. In contrast to millimeter wave scanners, which create a 3D image, backscatter X-ray scanners will typically only create a 2D image. For airport screening, images are taken from both sides of the human body. Backscatter X-ray was first applied in a commercial low-dose personnel scanning system by Dr. Steven W. Smith. Smith developed the Secure 1000 whole- body scanner in 1992 and then sold the device and associated patents to Rapiscan Systems, who now manufactures and distributes the device.  Large scale  Some backscatter X-ray scanners can scan much larger objects, such as trucks and containers. This scan is much faster than a physical search and could potentially allow a larger percentage of shipping to be checked for smuggled items, weapons, drugs, or people. There are also gamma-ray-based systems coming to market.. In May 2011, the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed suit against the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Freedom of Information Act, claiming that DHS had withheld nearly 1000 pages of documents related to the Z backscatter vans and other mobile backscatter devices. Concerns =Legality= Since in addition to weapons, these machines are designed to be capable of detecting drugs, currency and contraband, which have no direct effect on airport security and passenger safety, some have argued that the use of these full body scanners is a violation of the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution and can be construed as an illegal search and seizure. =Privacy= An image of Susan Hallowell, Director of the Transportation Security Administration's research lab taken with backscatter x-ray system. Backscatter x-ray technology has been proposed as an alternative to personal searches at airport and other security checkpoints easily penetrating clothing to reveal concealed weapons. It raises privacy concerns about what is seen by the person viewing the scan. Some worry that viewing the image violates confidential medical information, such as the fact a passenger uses a colostomy bag, has a missing limb or wears a prosthesis, or is transgender. The ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center are opposed to this use of the technology. The ACLU refers to backscatter x-rays as a \\"virtual strip search\\". According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in one trial 79 percent of the public opted to try backscatter over the traditional pat-down in secondary screening. It is \\"possible for backscatter X-raying to produce photo-quality images of what's going on beneath our clothes\\", thus, many software implementations of the scan have been designed to distort private areas.. According to the TSA, further distortion is used in the Phoenix airport's trial system where photo-quality images are replaced by chalk outlines. The TSA has also commented that screening procedures such as having the screener viewing the image located far away from the person being screened could be a possibility. In light of this, some journalists have expressed concern that this blurring may allow people to carry weapons or certain explosives aboard by attaching the object or substance to their genitals.. The British newspaper The Guardian has revealed concern among British officials that the use of such scanners to scan children may be illegal under the Protection of Children Act 1978, which prohibits the creation and distribution of indecent images of children. This concern may delay the introduction of routine backscatter scanning in UK airports, which had been planned in response to the attempted Christmas Day 2009 attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253. The Fiqh Council of North America have also issued the following fatwa in relation to full-body scanners: In August 2010, it was reported that U.S. Marshals (part of the Department of Justice), saved thousands of images from a low resolution mm wave scanner: This machine does not show details of human anatomy, and is a different kind of machine from the one used in airports. TSA, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said that its scanners do not save images and that the scanners do not have the capability to save images when they are installed in airports, but later admitted that the scanners are required to be capable of saving images for the purpose of evaluation, training and testing. =Health effects= Unlike cell phone signals, or millimeter-wave scanners, the energy being emitted by a backscatter X-ray is a type of ionizing radiation that breaks chemical bonds. Ionizing radiation is considered carcinogenic even in very small doses but at the doses used in airport scanners this effect is believed to be negligible for an individual.. If 1 million people were exposed to 520 scans in one year, one study estimated that roughly four additional cancers would occur due to the scanner, in contrast to the 600 additional cancers that would occur from the higher levels of radiation during flight. Since the scanners do not have a medical purpose, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not need to subject them to the same safety evaluations as medical X-rays. However, the FDA has created a webpage comparing known estimates of the radiation from backscatter X-ray body scanners to that of other known sources, which cites various reasons they deem the technology to be safe. Four professors at the University of California, San Francisco, among them members of NAS and an expert in cancer and imaging, in an April 2010 letter to the presidential science and technology advisor raised several concerns about the validity of the indirect comparisons the Food and Drug Administration used in evaluating the safety of backscatter x-ray machines. They argued that the effective dose is higher than claimed by the TSA and the body scanner manufacturers because the dose was calculated as if distributed throughout the whole body, whereas most of the radiation is absorbed in the skin and tissues immediately underneath. Other professors from the radiology department at UCSF disagree with the claims of the signing four professors. The UCSF professors requested that additional data be made public detailing the specific data regarding sensitive areas, such as the skin and certain organs, as well as data on the special (high- risk) population. In October 2010, the FDA and TSA responded to these concerns. The letter cites reports which show that the specific dose to the skin is some 89,000 times lower than the annual limit to the skin established by the NCRP. Regarding the UCSF concerns over the high-risk population to sensitive organs, the letter states that such an individual \\"would have to receive more than 1,000 screenings to begin to approach the annual limit\\".FDA & NIST Assessment (2006); Our dose modeling reveals that a screening that delivers 0.25 ¬µSv effective dose would deliver approximately 0.12 ¬µSv to the uterus or 0.69 ¬µSv to the testes... John Sedat, the principal author of the UCSF letter, responded in November 2010 that the White House's claim that full-body scanners pose no health risks to air travelers is in \\"error,\\" adding that the White House statement has \\"many misconceptions, and we will write a careful answer pointing out their errors.\\" In a December 2, 2010 letter to the House of Representatives, Dr. Steven Smith, inventor of the body scanner in 1991, stated that the concerns of Brenner and UCSF regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners is incorrect and the result of a confusion between dose and imaging penetration. Smith demonstrated this difference with two experiments using plastic (with a similar rate of absorption as body tissue), copper (the image subject), and an x-ray scanner. The dose-penetration experiment shows that plastic samples absorb 5% and 50% of the beam intensity respectively, whereas the imaging penetration experiment shows that plastic samples reduce the image darkness by 23% and 50% respectively. Dr. Smith states that those who calculate high skin dosage have incorrectly used the shallow imaging penetration value of a few millimeters (~), whereas the actual dosage is calculated by the deeper dose penetration. The TSA has also made public various independent safety assessments of the Secure 1000 Backscatter X-ray Scanner. Radiation safety authorities including the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, The Health Physics Society and the American College of Radiology, have stated that there is no specific evidence that full-body scans are unsafe.. The Secure 1000 Backscatter X-ray scanner was developed in 1992 by Dr. Steve Smith. The scanner has been studied extensively for almost 20 years by the leading independent radiation safety authorities in the United States. Experimental and epidemiological data do not support the proposition, however, that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer. The UK Health Protection Agency has completed an analysis of the X-ray dose from backscatter scanners and has written that the dose is extremely low and \\"about the same as people receive from background radiation in an hour\\". The Health Physics Society (HPS) reports that a person undergoing a backscatter scan receives approximately 0.05 ŒºSv (0.005 mrem) of radiation; American Science and Engineering Inc. reports 0.09 ŒºSv (0.009 mrem). At the high altitudes typical of commercial flights, naturally occurring cosmic radiation is considerably higher than at ground level. The radiation dose for a six-hour flight is 20 ŒºSv (2 mrem) ‚Äì 200 to 400 times larger than a backscatter scan. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Agency limits radiation exposure to the public to less than 1 mSv (100 mrem) per year from nuclear power plants. While this is not specifically for airline-associated radiation, the limit is an effective proxy for understanding what level is deemed safe by a regulatory agency. According to a draft standard on the United States FDA website, the allowable dose from a scan would be 0.1 ŒºSv, and that report uses a model whereby a 0.01 ŒºSv dose increases an individual's risk of death by cancer during his or her lifetime by . Since the dose limit is ten times higher than 0.01 ŒºSv, their model would predict one additional cancer death per 200 million scans. Since the airports in the UK handled 218 million passengers in 2009, if all passengers in the UK were scanned at the maximum dosage, then each year this would produce on average one additional cancer death (since there would be 200 million scans per year that the scanners were in operation), though usually each death would not occur in the same year as the particular scan that caused it, since the cancer may take years to grow. In addition, additional people would be given cancer but would die from other causes. There may not yet be evidence of hereditary effects of x-rays administered by backscatter scanners, but backscatter scanners use the same kind of x-ray photons as are produced in medical x-ray machines but expose the subject at a considerably lower dose, so it is possible that the results from medical radiology may be relevant, at least until a study is done of any effects specific to backscatter x-ray machines. Fathers exposed to medical diagnostic x-rays are more likely to have infants who contract leukemia, especially if exposure is closer to conception or includes two or more X-rays of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract or lower abdomen. In medical radiography the x-ray beam is adjusted to expose only the area of which an image is required, so that generally shielding is applied to the patient to avoid exposing the gonads, whereas in an airport backscatter scan, the testicles of men and boys will be deliberately subjected to the direct beam in order to check for weapons in the underpants, and some radiation will also reach the ovaries of female subjects. A linear dose- response relationship has been observed between x-ray dose and double-strand breaks in DNA in human sperm. Extrapolations of cancer risk from minuscule exposures to radiation across large populations, however, are not supported by analysis by the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP). On May 26, 2010 NCRP issued a press release to address such comments about full body scanners that are compliant with ANSI N43.17. In Commentary No.16 issued on May 26, 2010, it reads as follows: According to NCRP, the use of statistical extrapolations that predict 1 death for every 200 million persons scanned for example (as above) is an unrealistic over-estimation. Other scientists at Columbia University have made the following statements in support of the safety of body scanners:. Furthermore, other scientists claim the health effects of backscatter are well understood whereas those from millimeter wave scanners are not: Experts evaluating backscatter x-ray machine technology have also argued that defects in the machines, damage from normal wear-and-tear, or software errors could focus an intense dose of radiation on just one spot of the body. For example, Dr. Peter Rez, a professor of physics at Arizona State University, has said, \\"The thing that worries me the most, is not what happens if the machine works as advertised, but what happens if it doesn't,\\" adding that a potential malfunction of the machine could increase the radiation dose. The designers and manufacturers of backscatter X-ray scanners claim that the scanners are designed to prevent the occurrence of these kinds of errors. The scanners' safety requirements include fail-safe controls and multiple overlapping interlocks. These features, combined with fault analysis, ensure that failure of any subsystem results in non-operation of the x-ray generator to prevent accidental exposures. In the United States, the TSA requires that certification to the ANSI N43.17 safety standard is performed by a third party and not by the manufacturer themselves.. The European Commission issued a report stating that backscatter x-ray scanners pose no known health risk, and that \\"assuming all other conditions equal\\", that backscatter x-ray scanners, which expose people to ionizing radiation, should not be used when millimeter- wave scanners that \\"have less effects on the human body\\" are available. However, the European Commission report provides no data substantiating its claim that \\"all other conditions are equal\\". One area where backscatter X-ray scanners can provide better performance than MM wave scanners, for example, is in the inspection of the shoes, groin and armpit regions of the body. In a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine on March 28, 2011 researchers at the University of California \\"calculated that fully implementing backscatter scanners would not significantly increase the lifetime risk of cancer for travelers.\\" The researchers calculated that for every 100 million passengers who flew seven one-way flights, there would be one additional cancer. =Efficacy= In March 2012, scientist and blogger Jonathan Corbett demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the technology by publishing a viral video showing how he was able to get a metal box through backscatter x-ray and millimeter wave scanners (including the currently-used \\"Automated Target Recognition\\" scanners) in two US airports... In April 2012, Corbett released a second video interviewing a TSA screener, who described firearms and simulated explosives passing through the scanners during internal testing and training.. Backscatter scanners installed by the TSA until 2013 were unable to screen adequately for security threats inside hats and head coverings, casts, prosthetics and loose clothing. This technology limitation of current scanners often requires these persons to undergo additional screening by hand or other methods and can cause additional delay or feelings of harassment. The next generation of backscatter scanners are able to screen these types of clothing, according to manufacturers; however, these machines are not currently in use in public airports. In Germany, field tests on more than 800,000 passengers over a 10-month trial period concluded that scanners were effective, but not ready to be deployed in German airports due to a high rate of false alarms. The Italian Civil Aviation Authority removed scanners from airports after conducting a study that revealed them to be inaccurate and inconvenient. The European Commission decided to effectively ban backscatter machines. In a 2011 staff report by Republican Members of Congress about the TSA, airport body scanners were described as \\"ineffective\\" and \\"easily thwarted.\\" Safety regulations and standards In the US, manufacturers of security related equipment can apply for protection under the SAFETY act, which limits their financial liability in product liability cases to the amount of their insurance coverage. The Rapiscan Secure 1000 was listed in 2006. In the US, an X-ray system can be considered to comply with requirements for general purpose security screening of humans if the device complies with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard #N43.17. In the most general sense, N43.17 states that a device can be used for general purpose security screening of humans if the dose to the subject is less than 0.25 ŒºSv (25 Œºrem) per examination and complies with other requirements of the standard. This is comparable to the average dose due to background radiation (i.e. radioactivity within the surrounding environment) at sea level in 1.5 hours; it is also comparable to the dose from cosmic rays when traveling in an airplane at cruising altitude for two minutes. Many types of X-ray systems can be designed to comply with ANSI N43.17 including transmission X-ray, backscatter X-ray and gamma ray systems. Not all backscatter X-ray devices necessarily comply with ANSI N43.17; only the manufacturer or end user can confirm compliance of a particular product to the standard. ANSI standards use a standard of measurement algorithm called \\"effective dose\\" that considers the different exposure of all parts of the body and then weights them differently. The interior of the human body is given more weight in this survey, and the exterior, including the skin organ, are given less weight. Technical countermeasures Some people wish to prevent either the loss of privacy or the possibility of health problems or genetic damage that might be associated with being subjected to a backscatter X-ray scan. One company sells X-ray absorbing underwear which is said to have X-ray absorption equivalent to of lead. Another product, Flying Pasties, \\"are designed to obscure the most private parts of the human body when entering full body airport scanners,\\" but their description does not seem to claim any protection from the X-ray beam penetrating the body of the person being scanned.

He began his career as a member of the Federalist Party, but later became a staunch supporter of Democratic presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren. Allen was born in Bernardston in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and schooled in nearby New Salem. He was descended from Edward Allen (1640‚Äì1696), who was born in England and settled in the Connecticut Colony. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1794, and was ordained as a Congregational minister. After serving three years in the pulpit, Allen began to study law, and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1800. Allen began his career in politics in 1806, when he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He served in the House until 1810, then served in the Massachusetts Senate from 1812 to 1815. A year after leaving the state senate, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he sat as a Federalist from 1817 to 1829. He was a noted supporter of the John Quincy Adams administration. After returning to Massachusetts, Allen became affected by the plight of western Massachusetts farmers and laborers, whose lives were being upended by industrialization. As a result of his observations and concerns, Allen became a vocal supporter of the Massachusetts Workingmen's Party, and was the party's unsuccessful nominee for state governor in 1833 and 1834. Allen died in Northfield, Massachusetts, and was buried in Bernardston. Legacy Allen's son, Elisha Hunt Allen, also served in the United States Congress.

Torsional vibration is often a concern in power transmission systems using rotating shafts or couplings where it can cause failures if not controlled. A second effect of torsional vibrations applies to passenger cars. Torsional vibrations can lead to seat vibrations or noise at certain speeds. Both reduce the comfort. In ideal power generation, or transmission, systems using rotating parts, not only the torques applied or reacted are \\"smooth\\" leading to constant speeds, but also the rotating plane where the power is generated (or input) and the plane it is taken out (output) are the same. In reality this is not the case. The torques generated may not be smooth (e.g., internal combustion engines) or the component being driven may not react to the torque smoothly (e.g., reciprocating compressors), and the power generating plane is normally at some distance to the power takeoff plane. Also, the components transmitting the torque can generate non-smooth or alternating torques (e.g., elastic drive belts, worn gears, misaligned shafts). Because no material can be infinitely stiff, these alternating torques applied at some distance on a shaft cause twisting vibration about the axis of rotation.  Sources of torsional vibration  Torsional vibration can be introduced into a drive train by the power source. But even a drive train with a very smooth rotational input can develop torsional vibrations through internal components. Common sources are: * Internal combustion engine: The torsional vibrations of the not continuous combustion and the crank shaft geometry itself cause torsional vibrations * Reciprocating compressor: The pistons experience discontinuous forces from the compression. * Universal joint: The geometry of this joint causes torsional vibrations if the shafts are not parallel. * Stick slip: During the engagement of a friction element, stick slip situations create torsional vibrations. * Lash: Drive train lash can cause torsional vibrations if the direction of rotation is changed or if the flow of power, i.e. driver vs. driven, is reversed. Crankshaft torsional vibration Torsional vibration is a concern in the crankshafts of internal combustion engines because it could break the crankshaft itself; shear-off the flywheel; or cause driven belts, gears and attached components to fail, especially when the frequency of the vibration matches the torsional resonant frequency of the crankshaft. Causes of the torsional vibration are attributed to several factors. *Alternating torques are generated by the slider-crank mechanism of the crankshaft, connecting rod, and piston. ** The cylinder pressure due to combustion is not constant through the combustion cycle. ** The slider-crank mechanism does not output a smooth torque even if the pressure is constant (e.g., at top dead centre there is no torque generated) ** The motion of the piston mass and connecting rod mass generate alternating torques often referred to as \\"inertia\\" torques * Engines with six or more cylinders in a straight line configuration can have very flexible crankshafts due to their long length. * 2 Stroke Engines generally have smaller bearing overlap between the main and the pin bearings due to the larger stroke length, hence increasing the flexibility of the Crankshaft due to decreased stiffness. * There is inherently little damping in a crankshaft to reduce the vibration except for the shearing resistance of oil film in the main and conrod bearings. If torsional vibration is not controlled in a crankshaft it can cause failure of the crankshaft or any accessories that are being driven by the crankshaft (typically at the front of the engine; the inertia of the flywheel normally reduces the motion at the rear of the engine). This potentially damaging vibration is often controlled by a torsional damper that is located at the front nose of the crankshaft (in automobiles it is often integrated into the front pulley). There are two main types of torsional dampers. *Viscous dampers consist of an inertia ring in a viscous fluid. The torsional vibration of the crankshaft forces the fluid through narrow passages that dissipates the vibration as heat. The viscous torsional damper is analogous to the hydraulic shock absorber in a car's suspension. * Tuned absorber type of \\"dampers\\" often referred to as a harmonic dampers or harmonic balancers (even though it technically does not damp or balance the crankshaft). This damper uses a spring element (often rubber in automobile engines) and an inertia ring that is typically tuned to the first torsional natural frequency of the crankshaft. This type of damper reduces the vibration at specific engine speeds when an excitation torque excites the first natural frequency of the crankshaft, but not at other speeds. This type of damper is analogous to the tuned mass dampers used in skyscrapers to reduce the building motion during an earthquake.  Torsional vibrations in electromechanical drive systems  Torsional vibrations of drive systems usually result in a significant fluctuation of the rotational speed of the rotor of the driving electric motor. Such oscillations of the angular speed superimposed on the average rotor rotational speed cause more or less severe perturbation of the electromagnetic flux and thus additional oscillations of the electric currents in the motor windings. Then, the generated electromagnetic torque is also characterized by additional variable in time components which induce torsional vibrations of the drive system. According to the above, mechanical vibrations of the drive system become coupled with the electrical vibrations of currents in the motor windings. Such a coupling is often complicated in character and thus computationally troublesome. Because of this reason, till present majority of authors used to simplify the matter regarding mechanical vibrations of drive systems and electric current vibrations in the motor windings as mutually uncoupled. Then, the mechanical engineers applied the electromagnetic torques generated by the electric motors as ‚Äòa priori‚Äò assumed excitation functions of time or of the rotor-to-stator slip, e.g. in paper B. F. Evans, A. J. Smalley, H. R. Simmons, Startup of synchronous motor drive trains: the application of transient torsional analysis of cumulative fatigue assessment, ASME Paper, 85-DET-122, 1985.A. Laschet A., Simulation von Antriebssystemen, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, London, New-York, Paris, Tokio, 1988.P. Schwibinger, R. Nordmann, Improvement of a reduced torsional model by means of parameter identification, Transactions of the ASME, Journal of Vibration, Acoustics, Stress and Reliability in Design, 111, 1989, pp. 17-26. usually basing on numerous experimental measurements carried out for the given electric motor dynamic behaviours. For this purpose, by means of measurement results, proper approximate formulas have been developed, which describe respective electromagnetic external excitations produced by the electric motor,.A. Laschet A., Simulation von Antriebssystemen, Springer- Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, London, New-York, Paris, Tokio, 1988. However, the electricians thoroughly modelled electric current flows in the electric motor windings, but they usually reduced the mechanical drive system to one or seldom to at most a few rotating rigid bodies, as e.g. in L. Harnefors, Analysis of subsynchronous torsional interaction with power electronic converters, IEEE Transactions on power systems, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2007, pp. 305-313. In many cases, such simplifications yield sufficiently useful results for engineering applications, but very often they can lead to remarkable inaccuracies, since many qualitative dynamic properties of the mechanical systems, e.g. their mass distribution, torsional flexibility and damping effects, are being neglected. Thus, an influence of drive system vibratory behaviour on the electric machine rotor angular speed fluctuation, and in this way on the electric current oscillations in the rotor and stator windings, can not be investigated with a satisfactory precision. Mechanical vibrations and deformations are phenomena associated with an operation of majority of railway vehicle drivetrain structures. The knowledge about torsional vibrations in transmission systems of railway vehicles is of a great importance in the fields dynamics of mechanical systems.R. Bogacz, T. Szolc, H. Irretier, An application of torsional wave analysis to turbogenerator rotor shaft response, J.Vibr. Acou. -Trans. of the Asme, Vol. 114-2 (1992) 149-153. Torsional vibrations in the railway vehicle drive train are generated by several phenomena. Generally, these phenomena are very complex and they can be divided into two main parts. *To the first one belongs the electromechanical interaction between of the railway drive system including the: electric motor, gears, the driven part of disc clutch and driving parts of the gear clutch.O. Ahmedov, V. Zeman, M. Byrtus, Modelling of vibration and modal properties of electric locomotive drive, Eng. Mech., Vol. 19: 2/3 (2012) 165‚Äì176. *To the second one belong torsional vibrations of the flexible wheels,S. Noga, R. Bogacz, T. Markowski, Vibration analysis of a wheel composed of a ring and a wheel-plate modelled as a three-parameter elastic foundation, J.Sound Vib., Vol. 333:24, (2014) 6706-6722.R. Bogacz, R. Konowrocki, On new effects of wheel-rail interaction, Arch. Appl. Mech, Vol.82 (2012)1313-1323. and wheelsets caused by variation of adhesion forces in the wheel-rail contact zone.5. V. Zeman, Z. Hlavac, Dynamic wheelset drive load of the railway vehicle caused by shortcircuit motor moment, App. & Comp. Mech., Vol.3, No.2 (2009)423‚Äì434. An interaction of the adhesion forces has nonlinear features which are related to the creep value and strongly depends on the wheel-rail zone condition and track geometry (when driving on a curve section of the track). In many modern mechanical systems torsional structural deformability plays an important role. Often the study of railway vehicle dynamics using the rigid multibody methods without torsionally deformable elements are used B.S. Branislav, Simulation of torsion moment at the wheel set of the railway vehicle with the traction electromotor for wavy direct current, Mech. Trans. Com., Issue 3 (2008) 6-9 This approach does not allow to analyse self-excited vibrations which have an important influence on the wheel-rail longitudinal interaction.J. Liu, H. Zhao, W. Zhai, Mechanism of self-excited torsional vibration of locomotive driving system, Front. Mech. Eng.China, Vol.5:4 (2010,) 465-469.

The modelling of an electromechanical interaction between the electric driving motor and the machine as well as to an influence of the self-excited torsional vibrations in the drive system.Konowrocki R., Szolc T., An analysis of the self-excited torsional vibrations of the electromechanical drive system,Vibrations in Physical Systems, , Vol.27, pp.187-194, 2016Konowrocki R., Analysis of electromechanical interaction in an electric drive system used in the high speed trains, ART Conference 2016, ADVANCED RAIL TECHNOLOGIES - 5th International Conference, 2016-11-09/11-11, Warsaw (PL), pp.1-2, 2016 Measuring torsional vibration on physical systems The most common way to measure torsional vibration is the approach of using equidistant pulses over one shaft revolution. Dedicated shaft encoders as well as gear tooth pickup transducers (induction, hall-effect, variable reluctance, etc.) can generate these pulses. The resulting encoder pulse train is converted into either a digital rpm reading or a voltage proportional to the rpm. The use of a dual- beam laser is another technique that is used to measure torsional vibrations. The operation of the dual-beam laser is based on the difference in reflection frequency of two perfectly aligned beams pointing at different points on a shaft. Despite its specific advantages, this method yields a limited frequency range, requires line-of-sight from the part to the laser, and represents multiple lasers in case several measurement points need to be measured in parallel. Torsional vibration software There are many software packages that are capable of solving the torsional vibration system of equations. Torsional vibration specific codes are more versatile for design and system validation purposes and can produce simulation data that can readily compared to published industry standards. These codes make it easy to add system branches, mass-elastic data, steady-state loads, transient disturbances and many other items only a rotordynamicist would need. Torsional vibration specific codes: * AxSTREAM RotorDynamics, ( SoftInWay) - Commercial FEA-based program for performing the full scope of torsional analyses on the complete range of rotating equipment.

Wellman has received career achievement awards from the Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association, the International Network for Social Network Analysis, the International Communication Association, the GRAND Network of Centres of Excellence, and two sections of the American Sociological Association: Community and Urban Sociology; Communication and Information Technologies. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2007. In 2012, Wellman was identified as having the highest h-index (of citations) of all Canadian sociologists.Toronto Globe and Mail, March 27, 2012, pp. B8-B9. Wellman was a faculty member at the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto for 46 years, from 1967 to 2013. Since July 2013, he has co-directed the NetLab Network. Wellman was honoured with the Lim Chong Yah Visiting Professorship of Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore in January‚ÄìFebruary 2015. Early life Barry Wellman was born and raised in the Grand Concourse and Fordham Road area of the Bronx, New York City. He attended P.S. 33 and Creston J.H.S. 79, and was a teenage member of the Fordham Flames.Barry Wellman, \\"I was a teenage network analyst,\\" Connections 17(2):28-45 He gained his high school degree from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959. He received his A.B. (Bachelor's) degree magna cum laude from Lafayette College in 1963, majoring in social history and winning prizes in both history and religious studies. At Lafayette, he was a member of the McKelvy Honors House and captained the undefeated 1962 College Bowl team, whose final victory was over Berkeley.Barry Wellman, \\"On from Lafayette,\\" http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications/index.html His graduate work was at Harvard University, where he trained with Chad Gordon, Charles Tilly and Harrison White, and also studied with Roger Brown, Cora DuBois, George Homans, Alex Inkeles, Florence Kluckhohn, Talcott Parsons and Phillip J. Stone. He received a M.A. in Social Relations in 1965 and a Ph.D. in Sociology in 1969. His focus was on community, computer applications, social networks and self-conception, and his dissertation showed that the social identities of African-American and White American Pittsburgh junior high school students were related to the extent of segregation of their schools. He has been married since 1965 to Beverly Wellman, a researcher in complementary and alternative medicine.Merrijoy Kelner and Beverly Wellman, eds., Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Challenge and Change. London: Harwood/Taylor and Francis, 2000; Community sociology Until 1990, he focused on community sociology and social network analysis. During his first three years in Toronto, he also held a joint appointment with the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry where he working with D.B. Coates, M.D., co-directing the \\"Yorklea Study\\" in the Toronto borough of East York. This first East York study, with data collected in 1968, attempted to do a field study of a large population, linking interpersonal relations with psychiatric symptoms. This early study of \\"social support\\" documented the prevalence of non-local friendship and kinship ties, demonstrating that community is no longer confined to neighborhood and studying non-local communities as social networks. Wellman's \\"The Community Question\\" paper, reporting on this study, has been selected as one of the seven most important articles in English- Canadian sociology.Claude Fischer, To Dwell among Friends: Personal Networks in Town and City.

A second East York study, conducted in 1978-1979 at the University of Toronto's Centre for Urban and Community Studies, used in-depth interviews with 33 East Yorkers (originally surveyed in the first study) to learn more information about their social networks. It provided evidence about which kinds of ties and networks supply which types of social support. It showed, for example, that sisters provide siblings with much emotional support, while parents provide financial aid.Nan Lin, Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action.

London: Sage, 1985. Although Wellman's work has shifted primarily to studies of the Internet (see section below), he has continued collaborative analyses of the first and second East York studies, showing that reciprocity (like social support) is much more of a tie phenomenon than a social network phenomenonGabriele Plickert, Rochelle C√¥t√© and Barry Wellman. 2007. \\" It's Not Who You Know, It's How You Know Them: Who Exchanges What With Whom?\\" Social Networks 29, 3:405-29. and that the frequency and supportiveness of interpersonal contact before the Internet was non-linearly associated with residential (and workplace) distance.Diana Mok and Barry Wellman. 2007. \\"How Much Did Distance Matter Before the Internet?\\" Social Networks 29: in press. Wellman has edited Networks in the Global Village (1999), a book of original articles about personal networks around the world. In 2007, he edited a special issue, \\"The Network is Personal\\" of the journal, Social Networks (vol. 29, no. 3, July), containing analyses from Canada, France, Germany and Iran. Social network theory Concomitant with his empirical work, Wellman has contributed to the theory of social network analysis. The most comprehensive statement is in his introductory article to Social Structures, co-edited with the late S.D. Berkowitz. This work reviews the history of social network thought, and suggests a number of basic principles of social network analysis.Barry Wellman, \\"Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance.\\" Pp. 19-61 in Social Structures: A Network Approach, edited by Barry Wellman and S.D.

As batches of personal networks are often studied, this calls for somewhat different techniques than the more common social network practice of analyzing a single large network. A 2007 paper, co-authored by Wellman (with Bernie Hogan and Juan-Antonio Carrasco), has discussed alternatives in gathering personal network data.Bernie Hogan, Juan-Antonio Carrasco and Barry Wellman. 2007. \\"Visualizing Personal Networks: Working with Participant-Aided Sociograms.\\" Field Methods 19 (2), May: 116-144.

White and associates has examined how to link social network analysis with the scientometric study of citation networks. This research has shown that scholarly friends do not necessarily cite each other, but that scholars cited in the same article are apt to seek each other out and become friends.Howard White, Barry Wellman and Nancy Nazer. 2004. \\"Does Citation Reflect Social Structure: Longitudinal Evidence from the \`Globenet' Interdisciplinary Research Group.\\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 55, 2: 111-26. Dimitrina Dimitrova, Emmanuel Koku, Barry Wellman and Howard White. \\"Who Do Scientists Network With?\\" Final Report to the Canadian Water Network, May 2007. Internet, technology and society Wellman has often worked in collaboration with computer scientists, communication scientists and information scientists. In 1990, he became involved in studying how ordinary people use the Internet and other communication technologies to communicate and exchange information at work, at home and in the community. Thus his work has expanded his interest in non-local communities and social networks to encompass the Internet, mobile phones and other information and communication technologies. =Work networks and ICTs= Wellman's initial project (\\"Cavecat\\" which morphed into \\"Telepresence\\") was in collaboration with Ronald Baecker, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Marilyn Mantei, Gale Moore, and Janet Salaff. This effort in the early 1990s was done before the widespread popularity of the Internet, to use networked PCs for videoconferencing and computer supported collaborative work (CSCW).Marilyn Mantei, Ronald Baecker, William Buxton, Thomas Milligan, Abigail Sellen and Barry Wellman. \\"Experiences in the Use of a Media Space.\\" 1992.

Caroline Haythornthwaite and Barry Wellman, \\"Work, Friendship and Media Use for Information Exchange in a Networked Organization.\\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 49, 12 (Oct., 1998): 1101-1114. Caroline Haythornthwaite (for her dissertation and other works) and Wellman analyzed why computer scientists connect with each other - online and offline. They discovered that friendships as well as collaborative work were prime movers of connectivity at work.Caroline Haythornthwaite and Barry Wellman, \\"Work, Friendship and Media Use for Information Exchange in a Networked Organization.\\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 49, 12 (Oct., 1998): 1101-1114.

San Diego: Academic Press, 1998. Wellman and Anabel Quan-Haase also studied whether such computer-supported work teams were supporting networked organizations, in which bureaucratic structure and physical proximity did not matter. Their research in one high-tech American organization - heavily dependent on instant messaging and e-mail - showed that the supposed ICT-driven transformation of work to networked organizations was only partially fulfilled in practice. The organizational constraints of departmental organization (including power) and physical proximity continued to play important roles. There were strong norms in the organization for when different communication media were used, with face-to-face contact intertwined with online contact.Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman. \\"Hyperconnected Net Work: Computer-Mediated Community in a High-Tech Organization.\\" Pp. 281-333 in The Firm as a Collaborative Community: Reconstructing Trust in the Knowledge Economy, edited by Charles Heckscher and Paul Adler.

Medford, NJ: Information Today, 2007. Wellman collaborated with Dimitrina Dimitrova, Tsahi Hayat, and Guang Ying Mo to do the NAVEL study of 140 networked scholars in a variety of research centres across Canada. They discovered that despite the emphasis on networking, disciplinary and spatial boundaries continue to affect who interacts with whom.Barry Wellman, Dimitrina Dimitrova, Tsahi Hayat, Guang Ying Mo, and Beverly Wellman. 2017. \\"Fifteen Implications of Networked Scholar Research for Networked Work.\\" International Journal of Communication, 11: =Community networks and ICTs= As a community sociologist, Wellman began arguing that too much analysis of life online was happening in isolation from other aspects of everyday life. He published several papers (alone and with associates) arguing the need to contextualize Internet research, and proposing that online relations - like off-line - would be best studied as ramified social networks rather than as bounded groups.Barry Wellman and Milena Gulia. \\"Net Surfers Don't Ride Alone: Virtual Communities as Communities.\\" Pp. 167-94 in Communities in Cyberspace, edited by Marc Smith and Peter edited by Barry Wellman.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. This argument culminated in a 2002 book, The Internet in Everyday Life (co-edited with Caroline Haythornthwaite), providing exemplification from studies in a number of social milieus. Wellman did empirical work in this area: he was part of a team (led by James Witte) that surveyed visitors to the National Geographic Society's website in 1998 and used these data to counter the dystopian argument that Internet involvement was associated with social isolation.Wenhong Chen, Jeffrey Boase and Barry Wellman. 2002. \\"The Global Villagers: Comparing the Users and Uses of the Internet Around the World.\\" Pp. 74-113 in The Internet in Everyday Life, edited by Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornthwaite.

Oxford: Blackwell. The large U.S. national random-sample survey analyzed in the Pew Internet report, \\"The Strength of Internet Ties\\" (with Jeffrey Boase, John B. Horrigan and Lee Rainie) also showed a positive association between communication online and communication by telephone and face-to-face. The study showed that email is well-suited for maintaining regular contact with large networks, and especially with relationships that are only somewhat strong. The study also found that Internet users get more help than non-users from friends and relatives. Research into the \\"glocalization\\" concept also fed into this intellectual stream. Keith Hampton and Wellman studied the Toronto suburb of \\"Netville\\", a pseudonym. It showed the interplay between online and offline activity, and how the Internet - aided by a list-serve - is not just a means of long-distance communication but enhances neighboring and civic involvement.Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman. 2003. \\"Neighboring in Netville: How the Internet Supports Community and Social Capital in a Wired Suburb.\\" City and Community 2, 3 (Fall): 277-311.

He collaborated with Helen Hua Wang and Jeffrey Cole of the World Internet Project's Center for the Digital Future to investigate the first national U.S. survey of social relationships and Internet use. Their work shows that the number of friends are growing, and that heavy Internet users have more friends than others.Hua Wang and Barry Wellman. 2010. \\"Social Connectivity in America: Changes in Adult Friendship Network Size from 2002 to 2007.\\" American Behavioral Scientist 53 (8): 1148-1169. Wellman also collaborated with Ben Veenhof (Statistics Canada), Carsten Quell (Department of Canadian Heritage) and Bernie Hogan to relate time spent at home on the Internet to social relations and civic involvement. A different focus is his collaboration on Wenhong Chen's study of transnational immigrant entrepreneurs who link China and North America.Wenhong Chen and Barry Wellman, \\"Doing Business at Home and Away: Policy Implications of Chinese-Canadian Entrepreneurship.\\" Canada in Asia Series, Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, Vancouver.

Wellman's work has continued to focus on the interplay between information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, social relations and social structure. He directed the Connected Lives study of the interplay between communication, community and domestic relationships in Toronto and in Chapleau in rural northern Ontario. Early findings of the interplay between online and offline life are summarized in \\"Connected Lives: The Project\\".Barry Wellman and Bernie Hogan, with Kristen Berg, Jeffrey Boase, Juan-Antonio Carrasco, Rochelle C√¥t√©, Jennifer Kayahara, Tracy L.M. Kennedy and Phouc Tran. \\"Connected Lives: The Project\\" Pp. 157-211 in Networked Neighbourhoods: The Online Community in Context, edited by Patrick Purcell. Guildford, UK: Springer, 2006. More focused research (with Jennifer Kayahara) has shown how the onetime two-step flow of communication has become more recursively multi-step as the result of the Internet's facilitation of information seeking and communication.Jennifer Kayahara and Barry Wellman, 2007. \\"Searching for Culture ‚Äì High and Low.\\" Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 12 (4): April: Research (with Tracy Kennedy) has argued that many households, like communities, have changed from local groups to become spatially dispersed networks connected by frequent ICT and mobile phone communication.Tracy Kennedy and Barry Wellman. 2007. \\"The Networked Household.\\" Information, Communication and Society 10: forthcoming.

Wellman is involved in the \\"Networked Individuals\\" project, using the fourth East York study to investigate their social networks and digital media use. His collaborators include Brent Berry, Molly-Gloria Harper, Maria Kiceveski, Guang Ying Mo, Anabel Quan-Haase, Helen Hua Wang, and Alice Renwen Zhang.

The most famous rebbe of the dynasty was Rabbi Mordechai Leifer of Nadvorna (the son of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Ber (Bertche) Leifer of Nadvorna), whose writings form the corpus of the group's Hasidic thought. He was raised by his great-uncle, Rebbe Meir, the Second, of Premishlan. He lived a life of poverty and simplicity, as he would donate all the money that came his way to the needy.Yalkut Mishlim Page 209 (Hebrew Text) http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33621&st;=&pgnum;=204 He was well known as a godly man, and a Baal Ruach HaKodesh.Achilas Matzos B'Yisroel Page 11 (Hebrew Text) http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9577&st;=&pgnum;=139 Hasidim from all over Hungary and Romania would come to receive his blessings and his advice.Tzadik Katumor Yifrach - Introduction - Number 7 (Hebrew Text) http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3749&st;=&pgnum;=50 His teachings are collected in G'dulas Mordechai, Tif'eres Mordechai, Aspaklarya Hame'ira, Ma'amar Mordechai, and Oros Mordechai. Rabbi Yissachar Dov Ber (Bertche) Leifer of Nadvorna was a son of Rabbi Yitzchak of Kalish (a brother of Rabbi Meir of Premishlan), a son of Rabbi Aharon Leib of Premishlan, a son of Rabbi Meir Hagadol of Premishlan, a disciple and friend of the Baal Shem Tov. The Nadvorna dynasty is notable inasmuch as many of its descendants become rebbes (even during the lifetime of their father). It has perhaps the largest numbers of rebbes of any Hasidic dynasty. Since many of the rebbes of the Nadvorna Dynasty (as in other rabbinic dynasties) married relatives, many of the rebbes in this list are sons-in-law of other rebbes on the list. There are Nadvorna congregations in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Haifa, Hadera, Tzfat, Williamsburg, London, and Bloomingburg, among others. The rebbes of the Nadvorna dynasty have several unique customs, such as playing a violin on special occasions, for instance in front of the menorah on the festival of Hanukkah. The mode of dress of Nadvorna rebbes is unique in that they typically wear a white gartel over a colorful bekishe, and a white crocheted Jerusalem-style kippah under their shtreimel.

Early life Cabell was born in Licking Hole, Goochland County, Virginia. He was the eldest son of physician and surveyor William Cabell (1699‚Äì1774) and Elizabeth Burks Cabell (1705‚Äì1756). Home schooled, Cabell joined his father as a vestryman of St. Anne's Parish, Albemarle County, Virginia in 1751, and two years later was officially appointed a surveyor in his own right. Career Cabell married Margaret Jordan in 1756, the same year he began his political career as a delegate in the House of Burgesses. He continuously served in successive assemblies until Lord Dunmore suppressed that legislative body just before the American Revolutionary War. Cabell joined the Albermarle County militia in 1756 and two years later became a commissioner for arranging military claims concerning the French and Indian War, hence his honorific, Colonel. In 1761, the House of Burgesses created Amherst County from part of Albermarle County. The following year, William Cabell received 1,785 acres of his inheritance early, and began establishing what would become his \\"Union Hill\\" plantation. Beginning in 1765, Amherst County voters then elected Col. Cabell as their delegate to all legislative assemblies until 1789, including serving on the local Committee of Safety during the revolutionary struggle. William Cabell served as the presiding justice for Amherst County beginning in 1777, and became the first state senator for what was then the 8th district. In 1788 Amherst County voters overwhelmingly elected Col. Cabell and his eldest son Samuel J. Cabell to represent them in the Virginia Ratification Convention (with 327 and 317 votes respectively, the next candidate receiving 23 votes), where both Cabells voted against the proposed United States Constitution, although the convention as a whole ratified it.Richard Labunski, James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights (Oxford University Press, 2006) p. 150 William Cabell then became a member of the committee that drew up the Declaration of Rights of January 7, 1789. Col. Cabell also served as one of the presidential electors who voted for George Washington as the first President of the United States, and as trustee of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College where his sons studied. Death and legacy William Cabell Sr. died in 1798 and was buried at Union Hill Cemetery in Wingina, Virginia.University of Virginia Libraries By the time of his death, he had distributed estates to various family members, who received an additional 30,000 acres in his will. Seven children survived Col. Cabell Sr. In addition to Samuel J. Cabell mentioned above, born the year of their marriage, Margaret Cabell bore William Cabell, Jr. (1759‚Äì1822), who served in the Continental Army, married the daughter of Virginia judge Paul Carrington and succeeded his father at \\"Union Hill,\\" most of which became part of Nelson County during the division of 1808. Their two other sons included Landon Cabell(1765‚Äì1834) and Hector Cabell (1768‚Äì1807). Their three daughters all married well. Margaret married prominent Nelson County planter and merchant Robert Rives, and their son William Cabell Rives had a distinguished legal and diplomatic career. Paulina (1763‚Äì1845) married Maj.

He produced more than two hundred documentary films, and wrote and directed more than half of these. Greaves garnered many accolades for his work, including four Emmy nominations. Early life Greaves was born in Harlem in New York City on October 8, 1926. He was one of seven children of taxi driver and minister Garfield Greaves and the former Emily Muir. After graduating from the elite Stuyvesant High School at the age of 18, Greaves attended City College of New York to study science and engineering, but eventually dropped out to pursue a career in theatre. Starting as a dancer, he eventually moved into acting, working in the American Negro Theater.Black Film Center/Archive. Accessed 2/10/2011. Career =Acting and film training= In 1948, Greaves joined The Actor's Studio and studied alongside the likes of Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Anthony Quinn, Shelley Winters, and others. During this time, he undertook a number of roles on the stage and in the theatre, but eventually grew dissatisfied with the roles in which he was being cast. Realizing that most of the parts he could play were stereotype and derivative due to racism prevalent throughout American culture at the time, Greaves looked into African-American history. Seeing that his opportunities would be limited were he to continue to stay in America and focus on his planned course of acting, Greaves tried his hand at movie making, electing to move to Canada and study at the National Film Board of Canada.Afrocentric News ‚Äì William Greaves. After six years working in various stages of production from director to editing, Greaves found himself behind the camera as director and editor of a film called Emergency Ward, which focused on the goings-on of a hospital emergency room on a Sunday evening. =Freelance documentaries and television work= As the 1960s saw the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, Greaves returned to The United States to participate in the ongoing discourse regarding African-Americans and their place in society. Based on his work on Emergency Ward, he was hired by both the United Nations and the film division of the United States Information Agency (USIA) to make several documentaries, the two most acclaimed of which were Wealth of a Nation, an examination of personal freedom as a key boon to America's strength, and The First World Festival of Negro Arts (1968), which documented the 1966 World Festival of Black Arts, a celebration of both African and African-American culture.Film Quarterly as accessed from WilliamGreaves.com on 2/10/11.\\"The First World Festival of Negro Arts\\", African Film Festival, New York. In 1969, following soon after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., public broadcasting syndicate National Educational Television (a direct predecessor to the modern-day PBS) began to air a show called Black Journal with a mission to present news by African Americans, for African Americans, and about African Americans. After a tumultuous opening during the first few tapings, the NET network promoted Greaves (a co-host at the time) to executive producer of the show. Greaves ran the show until 1970, winning the show and himself an Emmy award for his work on the program in 1969. =After Black Journal= In 1970, after working on Black Journal for three years, Greaves opted to leave television to focus on film making. In 1971 he released a film titled Ali, the Fighter, which focused on Muhammad Ali's first attempt to regain his professional boxing heavyweight title. Greaves then went on to produce and make films for various commissions and government agencies, including NASA and The Civil Service Commission. After this, Greaves produced numerous works, including From These Roots, Nationtime: Gary, Where Dreams Come True, Booker T.Washington: Life and Legacy, Frederick Douglass: An American Life, Black Power in America: Myth or Reality?, The Deep North, and Ida B. Wells: A Passion for Justice, which was narrated by Nobel Prize in Literature and Pulitzer Prize winning author Toni Morrison. In 2001, Greaves released one of his most ambitious works Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey. According to Greaves, between attempting to securing funds and researching countless old manuscripts, photos, and newsreel footage, the film took him ten years to make. The final product was edited down from an initial cut of seventeen hours to two hours for the PBS show American Odyssey. The final project, narrated by Sidney Poitier, sought to bring the name of Ralph Bunche back into the public lexicon as Greaves felt he was an important, yet forgotten, political figure, one important to African American history and the Civil Rights Movement. Symbiopsychotaxiplasm While working on Black Journal, Greaves continued to produce films out of his own production company, William Greaves productions, which he had founded in 1964. One of the films he produced in this time period was a documentary that blended his fascination with the acting process with documentary film, which he called Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, an experimental, avant-garde film that he shot in the cin√©ma v√©rit√© documentary style that was growing in popularity. The film, which was shot in 1968, takes place in Central Park in New York City and follows a documentary entitled Over the Cliff, one supposedly directed by Greaves himself and focusing on different pairs of actors who prepare to audition for a dramatic piece. What makes the film complicated are the three sets of camera crews Greaves employs to document this audition process. The first is told to film the actors in an effort to document the audition process. The second is told to document the first film crew. The third is told to document the actors, the remaining two crews, and any other passers-by or spectators who happen to fit into Over the Cliff's overarching theme of \\"sexuality\\". As the film goes on, the various film crews start to grow irritated at what they perceive is an incompetent and sexist (or perhaps even misogynistic) director in Greaves. Torn between whether or not this entire situation is a plot by Greaves or not, the crews find themselves divided against him, at one point even plotting a revolt against their director. All of their doubts, insecurities, complaints, etc. are captured on film, and, when the project is complete, they turn all of their footage over to Greaves (including the incriminating evidence). Greaves, in turn incorporates their footage into his final product. Through all of this, Greaves creates a giant circular meta-documentary featuring a documentary, a documentary about a documentary, and a documentary documenting a documentary about a documentary and all in the attempt of creating and capturing reality on film. To add to the coherence or incoherence of the piece, the film is also edited untraditionally, with the different cameras' various shots intercut in split screens so that all three sets of simultaneous footage display the same sequence but from three perspectives. Symbiopsychotaxiplasm was unable to find mainstream distribution and instead toured various festivals and museum screenings, gaining something of a cult status amongst those filmmakers who had seen it. It eventually caught the eye of famous actor and filmmaker Steve Buscemi who saw it at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992.Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Still No Answers. Accessed 2/10/2011. Ten years later, Buscemi and director Steven Soderbergh teamed up to secure widespread distribution for the film as well as financing for the making of one of the four sequels Greaves had considered once he had finished the initial product in the late 1960s. Symbiopsychotaxiplasm was finally released theatrically under its new title Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One alongside its sequel, Symbiopsychotaxipasm: Take 2¬Ω, in 2003. The sequel focused on two of the actors from the original and picks up the narrative of the original film some thirty-five years later. Personal life On August 23, 1959, Greaves married Louise Archambault, who became a frequent collaborator on his projects, going so far as to even produce his documentary on Ralph Bunche. They have three children: David, Taiyi, and Maiya. Between 1969 and 1982, Greaves taught film and television acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York. While not working, Greaves could be found touring various universities and cultural centers around the world presenting his films, conducting workshops, and speaking about his experiences in indie film and the process of creating film as it is to actors, directors, professionals, and more. Greaves died at the age of 87 at his home in Manhattan on August 25, 2014.Watkins, Mel. \\"William Greaves, a Documentarian and Pioneering Journalist, Dies at 87\\", The New York Times, Wednesday, August 27, 2014. Awards and accolades Besides the Emmy he won for his work as executive producer of Black Journal in 1969, Greaves was nominated for an Emmy for his work Still a Brother: Inside the Negro Middle Class, which also won the Blue Ribbon Award at the American Film Festival. Beyond these, many of his films have played at festivals and garnered numerous awards, with certain films (including Ida B. Wells) winning upwards of twenty awards across the many venues where they have been played.\\"About William Greaves\\". Making the Movie, Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey. Accessed 2/10/2011.

The park is named for its several springs, which the Creek Indians used for centuries to heal the sick. The water from these springs is said to have a sulfur smell and taste. Indian Springs is thought to be the oldest state park in the nation. It was acquired from the Creek Indians by the state through the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825) and the Treaty of Washington (1826). Thereafter, Indian Springs has been operated continuously by the state as a public park, although it did not gain the title \\"State Park\\" until 1931. The area became a resort town in the 19th century. It became an official \\"State Forest Park\\" in 1927. In 1931, along with Vogel State Park, it became a founding unit of Georgia's state park system. Visitors are still allowed to sample the park's spring water, all the while enjoying swimming, fishing, and boating. Several structures within the park were built during the Great Depression by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The park also contains a 105-acre (0.42 km¬≤) lake consistently stocked with fish, as well as a 3/4 mile (1.21 km) nature trail. The park features a small museum that is open seasonally.

Originally called the \\"Holy Alliance\\", it was instituted by Martin Van Buren, who remained its dominating spirit for many years. The group was among the first American political machines. In the beginning they were the leading figures of the Bucktails faction of the Democratic-Republican Party, later the Jacksonian Democrats and finally became the Hunkers faction of the Democratic Party. History The Albany Regency was a loosely organized group of politicians with similar views and goals who resided in or near Albany, New York, the state capital. They controlled the nominating conventions and patronage of their party within New York State, and by dictating its general policy, exerted a powerful influence in national as well as state politics. They derived their power largely from their personal influence and political sagacity, and were, for the most part, earnest opponents of political corruption, though they uniformly acted upon the principle, first formulated in 1833 by one of their number (Marcy), that ‚Äúto the victors belong the spoils.‚Äù The Regency developed party discipline and originated the control of party conventions through officeholders and others subservient to it. The spoils system they had created would dominate late-19th-century American politics, but in the beginning, observed the technical qualifications of the candidates for office they nominated. Thurlow Weed, who coined the name \\"Albany Regency\\", wrote he \\"had never known a body of men who possessed so much power and used it so well\\".Thurlow Weed Barnes: Life of Thurlow Weed Vol. II, p. 36 However, this also may have potentially been intended by Weed to be a disparaging remark. The leading figure of the Albany Regency was Martin Van Buren. Upon Van Buren's election to the United States Senate in 1821, several of his friends and aides, including Benjamin F. Butler, Samuel A. Talcott, Silas Wright, William L. Marcy, and Azariah C. Flagg, took over the day-to-day management of the political organization that had been developed under Van Buren. Roger Skinner, state printer Edwin Croswell, Benjamin Knower, John Adams Dix, and Charles E. Dudley also became members of the Regency. Their organ was the newspaper Argus of Albany, founded in 1813 by Jesse Buel (1778-1839) and edited from 1824 to 1854 by Croswell. The regency largely dictated political policy to Tammany Hall during this era. The Regency ended when Marcy was defeated in the election for Governor of New York by the opposing Whig's candidate William H. Seward in 1838, which led to a radical change in state politics. Also cited as a factor is a bitter factional split in 1848 (see Barnburners) which gave the other party the patronage the Regency used to use against it. The Regency was reduced in a few years to unorganized individuals. In 1845 Mackenzie published private letters between Jesse Hoyt and various members of the Albany Regency. These letters described negotiations between various members of the Regency for financial transactions and appointments to government office and exposed how members of the Regency were able to profit from speculatory notes and political corruption.

The transmissions are picked up by receivers that are either connected to the conductors, or a short distance from them. Carrier current transmission is used to send audio and telemetry to selected locations, and also for low-power broadcasting that covers a small geographical area, such as a college campus. The most common form of carrier current uses longwave or medium wave AM radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring, although other conductors can be used, such as telephone lines.  Technology  Carrier current generally uses low-power transmissions. In cases where the signals are being carried over electrical wires, special preparations must be made for distant transmissions, as the signals cannot pass through standard utility transformers. Signals can bridge transformers if the utility company has installed high-pass filters, which typically has already been done when carrier current-based data systems are in operation. Signals can also be impressed onto the neutral leg of the three-phase electric power system, a practice known as \\"neutral loading\\", in order to reduce or eliminate mains hum (60 hertz in North American installations), and to extend effective transmission line distance. For a broadcasting installation, a typical carrier current transmitter has an output in the range 5 to 30 watts. However, electrical wiring is a very inefficient antenna, and this results in a transmitted effective radiated power of less than one watt, and the distance over which signals can be picked up is usually less than 60 meters (200 feet) from the wires. Transmission sound quality can be good, although it sometimes includes the low-frequency mains hum interference produced by the alternating current. However, not all listeners notice this hum, nor is it reproduced well by all receivers. Extensive systems can include multiple unit installations with linear amplifiers and splitters to increase the coupling points to a large electrical grid (whether a campus, a high-rise apartment or a community). These systems would typically require coaxial cable interconnection from a transmitter to the linear amplifiers. In the 1990s, LPB, Inc., possibly the largest manufacturer of these transmission systems, designed and supplied several extensive campus-based systems that included fiber-optic links between linear amplifiers to prevent heterodyne interference. Initial development The ability for electrical conductors to act as waveguides for radio signals was noted in the earliest days of radio experimentation, and Heinrich Hertz published the first review of the phenomenon in 1889.\\"Heinrich Hertz\\", The Electrician, July 20, 1894, page 333. Hertz's paper was titled \\"On the Propagation of Electric Waves along Wires\\". By 1911, Major General George Owen Squier was conducting some of the earliest studies designed to put carrier current transmissions, which he called \\"wired wireless\\", to practical use.\\"Multiplex Telephony and Telegraphy by Means of Electric Waves Guided by Wires\\" by George O. Squier, Proceedings of the American Institute of American Engineers, May, 1911, pages 857-862. Squier assigned ownership of his U.S. patents to \\"the American People\\". He later unsuccessfully tried to claim that this had not exempted commercial concerns from paying royalties on his patents. To be effective, the radio transmitter must be capable of generating pure continuous-wave AM transmissions. Thus, the technology needed to set up carrier current transmissions would not be readily available until the late 1910s, with the development of vacuum tube transmitters and amplifiers. Long-distance communication The first commercial applications of carrier current technology included the setting up of long-distance telegraph, telemetry, and telephone communication by electrical companies over their high-voltage distribution lines. This approach had a major advantage over standard telegraph and telephone lines, because radio signals can readily jump over any small gaps in cases when there is a line break. In May 1918, the Imperial Japanese Electro-Technical Laboratory of Tokyo successfully tested \\"wave telephony\\" over the Kinogawa Hydro-Electric Company's 144-kilometer (90-mile) long power line.\\"Telephony over Power Lines (Early History)\\" by Mischa Schwartz, \\"Presented IEEE History Conference, Newark, New Jersey, August 2007 and annotated since\\". (ethw.org) In the summer of 1920, a successful test transmission over 19.2 kilometers (12 miles) of high-tension wires was reported from New Jersey,\\"Interplant Telephonic Communications Established Over High-Tension Lines\\", Electrical World, July 17, 1920, page 141. and by 1929, 1,000 installations had been made in the United States and Europe. The majority of power line communication installations use transmissions in the longwave band, to avoid interference to and from standard AM stations. Home entertainment services =United States= In 1923, the Wired Radio Service Company, a subsidiary of the local electric company, set up a subscription news and entertainment service at Staten Island, New York that used carrier current transmissions over the electrical power lines. To receive the transmissions, subscribers had to lease a receiver costing between two and five dollars a month.\\"Giving the Public a Light-Socket Broadcasting Service\\" by William Harris, Jr., Radio Broadcast, October 1923, pages 465-470. However, despite the power company's optimism that the system would eventually be installed nationally, the effort proved unable to compete with the free offerings provided by standard radio stations. General Squier continued to unsuccessfully promote the technology for home entertainment, until 1934, when he helped found the Muzak company, which focused on the business market. =Europe= Carrier current home entertainment services would prove to be more popular in Europe. Previously, there had been a few successful telephone newspaper services, which sent entertainment to subscribers over standard telephone lines. However, carrier current transmissions had the ability to provide programs over telephone lines without affecting the regular telephone service, and could also send multiple programs simultaneously. In Germany, the carrier current service was called Drahtfunk, and in Switzerland Telefonrundspruch. In the Soviet Union, this approach was very common beginning in the 1930s because of its low cost and accessibility, and because it made reception of uncensored over-the-air transmissions more difficult. In Norway radiation from power lines was used, provided by the Linjesender facility. In Britain such systems were used for a time in areas where reception from conventional BBC radio transmitters was poor. In these systems programs were fed by special transformers into the lines. To prevent uncontrolled propagation, filters for the service's carrier frequencies were installed in substations and at line branches. Systems using telephone wires were incompatible with ISDN which required the same bandwidth to transmit digital data. Although the Swiss and German systems have been discontinued, the Italian :it:Filodiffusione still has several hundred thousand subscribers. Programs formerly carried by \\"wire broadcasting\\" in Switzerland included: * 175 kHz Swiss Radio International * 208 kHz RSR1 \\"la premi√®re\\" (French) * 241 kHz \\"classical music\\" * 274 kHz RSI1 \\"rete UNO\\" (Italian) * 307 kHz DRS 1 (German) * 340 kHz \\"easy music\\" Low-power broadcasting stations Carrier current technology is also used for broadcasting radio programs that can be received over a small area by standard AM radios. This is most often associated with college radio and high school radio, but also has applications for hospital radio stations and at military bases, sports stadiums, convention halls, mental and penal institutions, trailer parks, summer camps, office buildings, and drive-in movie theaters. Transmitters that use carrier current are very simple, making them an effective option for students interested in radio. Carrier current broadcasting began in 1936, when students at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island developed a carrier current station initially called \\"The Brown Network\\". This station was founded by George Abraham\\"Dr. George Abraham, Ph.D\\" (collegebroadcasters.us) and David W. Borst,\\"David W. Borst\\" (collegebroadcasters.us) who had originally installed an intercom system between their dormitory rooms. The intercom links were first expanded to additional locations, and then the system was replaced by distributed low- powered radio transmitters, which fed their signals into various buildings' electrical wires, allowing nearby radio receivers to receive the transmissions.The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946 by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 11-13. The carrier current station idea soon spread to other college campuses, especially in the northeastern United States. The Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) was formed in February 1940, to coordinate activities between twelve college carrier current stations and to solicit advertisers interested in sponsoring programs geared toward their student audiences.Bloch (1980) pages 102-103. The innovation received a major publicity boost by a complimentary article that appeared in the May 24, 1941 issue of The Saturday Evening Post,\\"Radiator-Pipe Broadcasters\\" by Erik Barnouw, The Saturday Evening Post, May 24, 1941, pages 36, 79-80. and eventually hundreds of college stations were established. Responding to the growing phenomenon, a 1941 release issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stated that because of the stations' very limited ranges, it had \\"not promulgated any rule governing their operation.\\"Bloch (1980) page 45. Therefore, to operate legally, U.S. carrier current station broadcast emissions must adhere to the FCC's Title 47 CFR Part 15 Rules for unlicensed transmissions.\\"Low Power Radio\\" (FCC.gov) =Educational institution carrier current and cablecast stations= Many college stations that went on to obtain FM broadcasting licenses started out as carrier current stations because of the low cost and relative ease of starting one up. Although college-based carrier current stations have existed for over 80 years, their numbers are steadily declining, becoming supplemented, or replaced, by other transmission methods, including low-power FM (LPFM), closed circuit over cable TV channels, and Internet streaming audio and video, along with simple PowerPoint presentations of college campus news and information being streamed using low- cost consumer televisions and monitors. As with most other student-run facilities, these stations often operate on sporadic schedules. In the United States, unlike educational FM stations, carrier current stations can carry a full range of advertising. Due to their low power, these stations do not require an FCC license, and are not assigned an official call sign.

It exists at the interface of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere.Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub The pedosphere is the skin of the Earth and only develops when there is a dynamic interaction between the atmosphere (air in and above the soil), biosphere (living organisms), lithosphere (unconsolidated regolith and consolidated bedrock) and the hydrosphere (water in, on and below the soil). The pedosphere is the foundation of terrestrial life on Earth. The pedosphere acts as the mediator of chemical and biogeochemical flux into and out of these respective systems and is made up of gaseous, mineralic, fluid and biologic components. The pedosphere lies within the Critical Zone, a broader interface that includes vegetation, pedosphere, groundwater aquifer systems, regolith and finally ends at some depth in the bedrock where the biosphere and hydrosphere cease to make significant changes to the chemistry at depth. As part of the larger global system, any particular environment in which soil forms is influenced solely by its geographic position on the globe as climatic, geologic, biologic and anthropogenic changes occur with changes in longitude and latitude. The pedosphere lies below the vegetative cover of the biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin without the aid of biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses and seed bearing plants, but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once weathering and decomposition products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile, causing ion exchange between solid, fluid and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk geochemistry of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil. Lithosphere The primary conditions for soil development are controlled by the chemical composition of the rock that the soil will eventually be forming on. Rock types that form the base of the soil profile are often either sedimentary (carbonate or siliceous), igneous or metaigneous (metamorphosed igneous rocks) or volcanic and metavolcanic rocks. The rock type and the processes that lead to its exposure at the surface are controlled by the regional geologic setting of the specific area under study, which revolve around the underlying theory of plate tectonics, subsequent deformation, uplift, subsidence and deposition. Metaigneous and metavolcanic rocks form the largest component of cratons and are high in silica. Igneous and volcanic rocks are also high in silica but with non-metamorphosed rock, weathering becomes faster and the mobilization of ions is more widespread. Rocks high in silica produce silicic acid as a weathering product. There are few rock types that lead to localized enrichment of some of the biologically limiting elements like phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). Phosphatic shale (< 15% P2O5) and phosphorite (> 15% P2O5) form in anoxic deep water basins that preserve organic material.Boggs, S., Jr., 1995, Principles of Sedimentary and Stratigraphy. Prentice Hall, NJ, USA Greenstone (metabasalt), phyllite and schist release up to 30‚Äì50% of the nitrogen pool. Thick successions of carbonate rocks are often deposited on craton margins during sea level rise. The widespread dissolution of carbonate and evaporate minerals leads to elevated levels of Mg2+, HCO3‚àí, Sr2+, Na+, Cl‚àí and SO42‚àí ions in aqueous solution.Faure, G., 1998, Principles and Applications of Geochemistry, 600 pp, Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ. Weathering and dissolution of minerals The process of soil formation is dominated by chemical weathering of silicate minerals, aided by acidic products of pioneering plants and organisms as well as carbonic acid inputs from the atmosphere. Carbonic acid is produced in the atmosphere and soil layers through the carbonation reaction. : mathrm{H_2O + CO_2 longrightarrow H^{+} + HCO_3^{-} longrightarrow H_2CO_3} This is the dominant form of chemical weathering and aides in the breakdown of carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite and silicate minerals such as feldspar. The breakdown of the Na-feldspar, albite, by carbonic acid to form kaolinite clay is as follows: : mathrm{2  NaAlSi_3O_8 + 2  H_2CO_3 + 9  H_2O longrightarrow 2  Na^{+} + 2  HCO_3^{-} + 4  H_4SiO_4 + Al_2Si_2O_5(OH)_4} Evidence of this reaction in the field would be elevated levels of bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí), sodium and silica ions in the water runoff. The breakdown of carbonate minerals: : mathrm{CaCO_3 + H_2CO_3 longrightarrow Ca^{2+} + 2  HCO_3^{-}} or: mathrm{CaCO_3 longrightarrow Ca^{2+} + CO_3^{2-}} The further dissolution of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3) produces CO2 gas. Oxidization is also a major contributor to the breakdown of many silicate minerals and formation of secondary minerals (diagenesis) in the early soil profile. Oxidation of olivine (FeMgSiO4) releases Fe, Mg and Si ions.Grandstaff, D., 1986, The dissolution rate of forsteritic olivine from Hawaiian beach sand: Rates of chemical weathering of rocks and minerals, pp. 41‚Äì59. The Mg is soluble in water and is carried in the runoff but the Fe often reacts with oxygen to precipitate Fe2O3 (hematite), the oxidized state of iron oxide. Sulfur, a byproduct of decaying organic material will also react with iron to form pyrite (FeS2) in reducing environments. Pyrite dissolution leads to high pH levels due to elevated H+ ions and further precipitation of Fe2O3 ultimately changing the redox conditions of the environment. Biosphere Inputs from the biosphere may begin with lichen and other microorganisms that secrete oxalic acid. These microorganisms, associated with the lichen community or independently inhabiting rocks, include a number of blue-green algae, green algae, various fungi, and numerous bacteria. Lichen has long been viewed as the pioneers of soil development as the following statement suggests: ‚ÄúThe initial conversion of rock into soil is carried on by the pioneer lichens and their successors, the mosses, in which the hair-like rhizoids assume the role of roots in breaking down the surface into fine dustClements, F.E., and Shelford, V.E., 1939, Bioecology. John Wiley, New York.‚Äù However, lichens are not necessarily the only pioneering organisms nor the earliest form of soil formation as it has been documented that seed-bearing plants may occupy an area and colonize quicker than lichen. Also, eolian sedimentation can produce high rates of sediment accumulation. Nonetheless, lichen can certainly withstand harsher conditions than most vascular plants and although they have slower colonization rates, do form the dominant group in alpine regions. Acids released from plant roots include acetic and citric acids. During the decay of organic matter Phenolic acids are released from plant matter and humic and fulvic acids are released by soil microbes. These organic acids speed up chemical weathering by combining with some of the weathering products in a process known as chelation. In the soil profile, the organic acids are often concentrated at the top while carbonic acid plays a larger role towards the bottom or below in the aquifer. As the soil column develops further into thicker accumulations, larger animals come to inhabit the soil and continue to alter the chemical evolution of their respective niche. Earthworms aerate the soil and convert large amounts of organic matter into rich humus, improving soil fertility. Small burrowing mammals store food, grow young and may hibernate in the pedosphere altering the course of soil evolution. Large mammalian herbivores above ground transport nutrients in form of nitrogen-rich waste and phosphorus-rich antlers while predators leave phosphorus-rich piles of bones on the soil surface, leading the localized enrichment of the soil below. Redox conditions in wetland soils Nutrient cycling in lakes and freshwater wetlands depends heavily on redox conditions. Under a few millimeters of water heterotrophic bacteria metabolize and consume oxygen. They therefore deplete the soil of oxygen and create the need for anaerobic respiration. Some anaerobic microbial processes include denitrification, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis and are responsible for the release of N2 (nitrogen), H2S (hydrogen sulfide) and CH4 (methane). Other anaerobic microbial processes are linked to changes in the oxidation state of iron and manganese. As a result of anaerobic decomposition, the soil stores large amounts of organic carbon because decomposition is incomplete. The redox potential describes which way chemical reactions will proceed in oxygen deficient soils and controls the nutrient cycling in flooded systems. Redox potential, or reduction potential, is used to express the likelihood of an environment to receive electrons and therefore become reduced. For example, if a system already has plenty of electrons (anoxic, organic-rich shale) it is reduced and will likely donate electrons to a part of the system that has a low concentration of electrons, or an oxidized environment, to equilibrate to the chemical gradient. The oxidized environment has high redox potential, whereas the reduced environment has a low redox potential. The redox potential is controlled by the oxidation state of the chemical species, pH and the amount of oxygen (O2) there is in the system. The oxidizing environment accepts electrons because of the presence of O2, which acts as electron acceptors: : mathrm{O_2 + 4  e^{-} + 4  H^{+} longrightarrow H_2O} This equation will tend to move to the right in acidic conditions which causes higher redox potentials to be found at lower pH levels. Bacteria, heterotrophic organisms, consume oxygen while decomposing organic material which depletes the soils of oxygen, thus increasing the redox potential. In low redox conditions the deposition of ferrous iron (Fe2+) will increase with decreasing decomposition rates, thus preserving organic remains and depositing humus. At high redox potential, the oxidized form of iron, ferric iron (Fe3+), will be deposited commonly as hematite. By using analytical geochemical tools such as x-ray fluorescence (XRF) or inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) the two forms of Fe (Fe2+ and Fe3+) can be measured in ancient rocks therefore determining the redox potential for ancient soils. Such a study was done on Permian through Triassic rocks (300‚Äì200 million years old) in Japan and British Columbia. The geologists found hematite throughout the early and middle Permian but began to find the reduced form of iron in pyrite within the ancient soils near the end of the Permian and into the Triassic. This suggests that conditions became less oxygen rich, even anoxic, during the late Permian, which eventually led to the greatest extinction in earth‚Äôs history, the P-T extinction. Decomposition in anoxic or reduced soils is also carried out by sulfur-reducing bacteria which, instead of O2 use SO42‚àí as an electron acceptor and produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide in the process: : mathrm{2  H^{+} + SO_4^{2-} + 2(CH_2O) longrightarrow 2  CO_2 + H_2S + 2  H_2O} The H2S gas percolates upwards and reacts with Fe2+ and precipitates pyrite, acting as a trap for the toxic H2S gas. However, H2S is still a large fraction of emissions from wetland soils.Kelly, D., and Smith, N., 1990, Organic sulfur compounds in the environment: biogeochemistry, microbiology, and ecological aspects: Advances in microbial ecology, v. 11, pp. 345‚Äì385. In most freshwater wetlands there is little sulfate (SO42‚àí) so methanogenesis becomes the dominant form of decomposition by methanogenic bacteria only when sulfate is depleted. Acetate, a compound that is a byproduct of fermenting cellulose is split by methanogenic bacteria to produce methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released to the atmosphere. Methane is also released during the reduction of CO2 by the same bacteria. Atmosphere In the pedosphere it is safe to assume that gases are in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Because plant roots and soil microbes release CO2 to the soil, the concentration of bicarbonate(HCO3) in soil waters is much greater than that in equilibrium with the atmosphere, the high concentration of CO2 and the occurrence of metals in soil solutions results in lower pH levels in the soil. Gases that escape from the pedosphere to the atmosphere include the gaseous byproducts of carbonate dissolution, decomposition, redox reactions and microbial photosynthesis. The main inputs from the atmosphere are aeolian sedimentation, rainfall and gas diffusion. Eolian sedimentation includes anything that can be entrained by wind or that stays suspended, seemingly indefinitely, in air and includes a wide variety of aerosol particles, biological particles like pollen and dust to pure quartz sand. Nitrogen is the most abundant constituent in rain (after water), as water vapor utilizes aerosol particles to nucleate rain droplets. Soil in forests Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminium (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Soil in the tropics Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Soil in grasslands and deserts Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche. Deserts behave similarly to grasslands but operate in constant drought as precipitation is less than evapotranspiration. Chemical weathering proceeds more slowly than in grasslands and beneath the caliche layer may be a layer of gypsum and halite. To study soils in deserts, pedologists have used the concept of chronosequences to relate timing and development of the soil layers. It has been shown that P is leached very quickly from the system and therefore decreases with increasing age. Furthermore, carbon buildup in the soils is decreased due to slower decomposition rates. As a result, the rates of carbon circulation in the biogeochemical cycle is decreased.

The name refers to a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of rock nearly high. According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this site was selected by King Kashyapa (477 ‚Äì 495 CE) for his new capital. He built his palace on the top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure ‚Äî Sƒ´nhƒÅgiri, the Lion Rock (an etymology similar to Sinhapura, the Sanskrit name of Singapore, the Lion City). The capital and the royal palace was abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning.  History  =Historical past= The environment around the Sigiriya may have been inhabited since prehistoric times. There is clear evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BCE. The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied nearly five thousand years ago during the Mesolithic Period. Buddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BCE in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE. In 477 CE, Kashyapa I, the king‚Äôs son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara, the King‚Äôs nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa‚Äôs reign (477 to 495 CE), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress. Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period. The Culavamsa describes King Kashyapa as the son of King Dhatusena. Kashyapa murdered his father by walling him up alive and then usurping the throne which rightfully belonged to his half-brother Moggallana, Dhatusena's son by the true queen. Moggallana fled to India to escape being assassinated by Kashyapa, but vowed revenge. In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka, which he considered to be rightfully his. Expecting the inevitable return of Moggallana, Kashyapa is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress as well as a pleasure palace. Moggallana finally arrived, declared war, and defeated Kashyapa in 495 CE. During the battle Kashyapa's armies abandoned him and he committed suicide by falling on his sword. The Culavamsa and folklore inform us that the battle- elephant on which Kashyapa was mounted changed course to take a strategic advantage, but the army misinterpreted the movement as the king's having opted to retreat, prompting the army to abandon him altogether. It is said that being too proud to surrender he took his dagger from his waistband, cut his throat, raised the dagger proudly, sheathed it, and fell dead. Moggallana returned the capital to Anuradhapura, converting Sigiriya into a Buddhist monastery complex,Geiger, Wilhelm. Culavamsa Being The More Recent Part Of Mahavamsa 2 Vols, Ch 39. 1929 which survived until the 13th or 14th century. After this period, no records are found on Sigiriya until the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was used briefly as an outpost of the Kingdom of Kandy. Alternative stories have the primary builder of Sigiriya as King Dhatusena, with Kashyapa finishing the work in honour of his father. Still other stories describe Kashyapa as a playboy king, with Sigiriya his pleasure palace. Even Kashyapa's eventual fate is uncertain. In some versions he is assassinated by poison administered by a concubine; in others he cuts his own throat when deserted in his final battle. Still further interpretations regard the site as the work of a Buddhist community, without a military function. This site may have been important in the competition between the Mahayana and Theravada Buddhist traditions in ancient Sri Lanka.  Archaeological remains and features  The Lion Gate and Climbing Stretch In 1831 Major Jonathan Forbes of the 78th Highlanders of the British army, while returning on horseback from a trip to Pollonnuruwa, encountered the \\"bush covered summit of Sigiriya\\".Forbes, Jonathan. Eleven Years in Ceylon. London: Richard Benley, 1841. Sigiriya came to the attention of antiquarians and, later, archaeologists. Archaeological work at Sigiriya began on a small scale in the 1890s. H.C.P. Bell was the first archaeologist to conduct extensive research on Sigiriya. The Cultural Triangle Project, launched by the Government of Sri Lanka, focused its attention on Sigiriya in 1982. Archaeological work began on the entire city for the first time under this project. There was a sculpted lion's head above the legs and paws flanking the entrance, but the head collapsed years ago. Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century. The Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes, the lower palaces clings to the slopes below the rocks. The moats, walls and gardens of the palace extended for a few hundred metres from the base of the rock. The site was both a palace and a fortress. The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock. Close up of the Lion's Paw = Site plan = Sigiriya is considered to be one of the most important urban planning sites of the first millennium, and the site plan is considered very elaborate and imaginative. The plan combined concepts of symmetry and asymmetry to intentionally interlock the man-made geometrical and natural forms of the surroundings. On the west side of the rock lies a park for the royals, laid out on a symmetrical plan; the park contains water-retaining structures, including sophisticated surface/subsurface hydraulic systems, some of which are working today. The south contains a man-made reservoir; these were extensively used from the previous capital of the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Five gates were placed at entrances. The more elaborate western gate is thought to have been reserved for the royals.  Frescoes  Artwork John Still in 1907 wrote, \\"The whole face of the hill appears to have been a gigantic picture gallery... the largest picture in the world perhaps\\".Senake Bandaranayake and Madhyama Sa·πÉskrÃ•tika Aramudala. Sigriya. 2005, page 38 The paintings would have covered most of the western face of the rock, an area 140 metres long and 40 metres high. There are references in the graffiti to 500 ladies in these paintings. However, most have been lost forever. More frescoes, different from those on the rock face, can be seen elsewhere, for example on the ceiling of the location called the \\"Cobra Hood Cave\\". Although the frescoes are classified as in the Anuradhapura period, the painting style is considered unique; the line and style of application of the paintings differing from Anuradhapura paintings. The lines are painted in a form which enhances the sense of volume of the figures. The paint has been applied in sweeping strokes, using more pressure on one side, giving the effect of a deeper colour tone towards the edge. Other paintings of the Anuradhapura period contain similar approaches to painting, but do not have the sketchy lines of the Sigiriya style, having a distinct artists' boundary line. The true identity of the ladies in these paintings still have not been confirmed. There are various ideas about their identity. Some believe that they are the ladies of the kings while others think that they are women taking part in religious observances. These pictures have a close resemblance to paintings seen in the Ajanta Caves in India. Subjects of the Sigiriya frescoes paintings These damsels have high foreheads shaping their faces with enticing doe eyes, a rose coloured blush on their cheeks and lips as lotus buds look down from the gallery where they reside. These lovely maidens wear blouses of the gossamer veil, the texture of which is silken cobwebs woven in the wind, seven layers of this diaphanous material is like evening dew on the grass and similar to running water.  Mirror wall  The mirror wall and spiral stairs leading to the frescoes Originally this wall was so highly polished that the king could see himself whilst he walked alongside it. Made of brick masonry and covered in highly polished white plaster, the wall is now partially covered with verses scribbled by visitors, some of them dating from as early as the 8th century. People of all types wrote on the wall, on varying subjects such as love, irony, and experiences of all sorts. Further writing on the mirror wall now has been banned for the protection of the old writings. The Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon, Senarath Paranavithana, deciphered 685 verses written in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries CE on the mirror wall.S. Paranavitana, Sigiri Graffiti. Being Sinhalese verses of the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, 2 vols. London: Oxford University Press, for the Archaeological Survey, Ceylon, 1956. One such poem from these long-past centuries, roughly translated from Sinhala, is: \\"I am Budal [the writer's name]. Came with hundreds of people to see Sigiriya. Since all the others wrote poems, I did not!\\"  Gardens  The Gardens of the Sigiriya city are one of the most important aspects of the site, as it is among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world. The gardens are divided into three distinct but linked forms: water gardens, cave and boulder gardens, and terraced gardens. = Water gardens = A pool in the garden complex The gardens of Sigiriya, as seen from the summit of the Sigiriya rock The water gardens can be seen in the central section of the western precinct. Three principal gardens are found here. The first garden consists of a plot surrounded by water. It is connected to the main precinct using four causeways, with gateways placed at the head of each causeway. This garden is built according to an ancient garden form known as char bagh, and is one of the oldest surviving models of this form. The second contains two long, deep pools set on either side of the path. Two shallow, serpentine streams lead to these pools. Fountains made of circular limestone plates are placed here. Underground water conduits supply water to these fountains which are still functional, especially during the rainy season. Two large islands are located on either side of the second water garden. Summer palaces are built on the flattened surfaces of these islands. Two more islands are located farther to the north and the south. These islands are built in a manner similar to the island in the first water garden. The third garden is situated on a higher level than the other two. It contains a large, octagonal pool with a raised podium on its northeast corner. The large brick and stone wall of the citadel is on the eastern edge of this garden. The water gardens are built symmetrically on an east-west axis. They are connected with the outer moat on the west and the large artificial lake to the south of the Sigiriya rock. All the pools are also interlinked using an underground conduit network fed by the lake, and connected to the moats. A miniature water garden is located to the west of the first water garden, consisting of several small pools and watercourses. This recently discovered smaller garden appears to have been built after the Kashyapan period, possibly between the 10th and 13th centuries. = Boulder gardens = The boulder gardens consist of several large boulders linked by winding pathways. The gardens extend from the northern slopes to the southern slopes of the hills at the foot of Sigiris rock. Most of these boulders had a building or pavilion upon them; there are cuttings that were used as footings for brick walls and beams. They were used to be pushed off from the top to attack enemies when they approached. Views from the top of Sigiriya rock = Terraced gardens = The terraced gardens are formed from the natural hill at the base of the Sigiriya rock. A series of terraces rises from the pathways of the boulder garden to the staircases on the rock. These have been created by the construction of brick walls, and are located in a roughly concentric plan around the rock. The path through the terraced gardens is formed by a limestone staircase. From this staircase, there is a covered path on the side of the rock, leading to the uppermost terrace where the lion staircase is situated.  In popular culture  * A version of Sigiriya features in Arthur C. Clarke's 1979 novel The Fountains of Paradise. * Some scenes from the music video for the 1982 single \\"Save a Prayer\\" by Duran Duran were filmed at the top of Sigiriya. * Sigiriya was featured in the eleventh episode of The Amazing Race 6 in 2005.

Herren releases music under the aliases Prefuse 73, Delarosa & Asora, Ahmad Szabo, and Piano Overlord, and is also part of the groups Savath y Savalas, Sons of the Morning, Fudge, Risil, and Diamond Watch Wrists. Biography Guillermo Scott Herren was born in Miami, Florida, and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. His father is Catalan and his mother is Irish and Cuban. At an early age his parents encouraged him to play piano and other instruments; his mother \\"forced\\" Herren to play a wide variety of instruments, even going so far as to teach him the Suzuki Method in order to \\"keep him out of trouble\\". Growing up, Herren's musical tastes branched out and he became interested in hip-hop, punk rock, and electronic music. He began his career DJing at MJQ, a small night club in Atlanta, and then began working in commercial studios producing hip-hop tracks for Dirty South rappers. However, Herren wanted to create his own music and started collecting second-hand instruments and drum machines during this part of his career. He eventually moved to New York City to go to college; there he began recording his first major release, Sleep Method Suite, under the name of \\"Delarosa and Asora\\". The album was released in 1997. In 2000, Herren released the album Folk Songs for Trains, Trees, and Honey under the name \\"Savath & Savalas\\". This album focused more on Herren's ambient and jazz influences. Herren first released music under the name \\"Prefuse 73\\" with 2001's commercially and critically successful Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives. A year later, a 4-track EP The '92 vs. '02 Collection was released. In 2003, Herren released the full-length album One Word Extinguisher, one of his best known Prefuse 73 albums to date. A companion album, Extinguished: Outtakes was released afterwards showing off some of the production \\"outtakes\\" and remixes that were omitted from the initial full-length. 2005 saw the release of Surrounded by Silence, Herren's third album as Prefuse 73. The album featured more collaborations with a variety of musicians, including rappers both underground and mainstream. Herren's next Prefuse 73 release, Security Screenings, was released in 2006; though as long as a full-length, the release was touted as an EP. On August 8, 2007, the fourth Prefuse 73 album, Preparations was announced and it was released on October 15, 2007. The album is sold with a bonus full-length disc titled Interregnums, featuring songs that were more ambient and contemplative than usual Prefuse 73 material. Along with partners Peter Rentz, Carolina Chaves, Ben Loiz, Carlos Ni√±o, and Paz Ochs, Herren started the Eastern Developments Music label. In June 2008, Herren announced the formation of a new collaborative project, Risil, which includes members of Sunn O))), Hella, School of Seven Bells, Pivot, and others. On June 24, 2009, the supergroup released their debut LP, entitled Non Meters Volume 1. Herren also released a new Savath & Savalas album, entitled La Llama, earlier in March of the same year, and a new Prefuse 73 LP entitled Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian. In 2009, under the name Diamond Watch Wrists, he and Zach Hill contributed a cover of a Pivot song to the Warp20 (Recreated) compilation. The group later released the album Ice Capped At Both Ends. Herren released three sets under the name Prefuse 73 in 2015: two EPs (Forsyth Gardens and Every Color of Darkness) and an album, Rivington N√£o Rio.

In 1850 Great Shelford parish contained bisected by the river Cam. The population in 1841 was 803 people. By 2001, this had grown to 3,949 and by the Census 2011 to 4,233. It was described as Britain's twenty-second richest village in 2011. Great Shelford is twinned with Verneuil-en-Halatte, in the Oise d√©partement of France. Trips to Verneuil-en-Halatte are run by the Shelford Twinning Association. Services and culture Village sign Great Shelford has a range of shops and services, including two public houses, two restaurants, a library, several estate agents, two barbers, a building society, a chemist, a dentist, a solicitor, an accountant, a delicatessen, a bakery and a garden centre. There is a monthly Farmers' Market. The villages of Great and Little Shelford are served by Shelford railway station on the West Anglia Main Line from Cambridge to London Liverpool Street.

Notable buildings =Parish church= left The parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin has changed little since Thomas Patesle rebuilt it in 1307; he can be seen in brass in his Vicar's robes on the chancel floor. The tower was rebuilt with the original materials after its collapse in 1798. The church porch is two- storeyed with a splendid pelican in its fine vaulted roof, the doorway having an old niche with a Madonna. The spacious interior has tall arcades with medieval clerestories over them and heads between the arches, and eight fine oak angels look down from the hammerbeams of the roof. There is a 15th-century screen with tracery in the north aisle enclosing an altar in memory of a soldier killed on the Indian frontier; above the altar is a painting of two saints and a Roman soldier by the cross. The chancel stalls are carved with wild roses, the sedilia with grapes and acorns, and the reredos has a gleaming white sculpture of the Crucifixion with saints and angels under rich canopies. There are a few fragments of old glass, fragments of Norman carving set in a wall, and above the chancel arch a medieval painting of Doom,Hadfield, John, ed. (1980) The Shell Book of English Villages. London: Michael Joseph; p. 126 fading away. = Houses= De Freville Farm is a 16th-century timber-framed farmhouse with hall and cross wings. Oak Cottage is also 16th-century and has a richly carved bressumer.Hadfield, John, ed. (1980) The Shell Book of English Villages. London: Michael Joseph; p. 126 History =Manors and families= Several great estates shared the two Shelfords, notably that of the de Freville family, whose manor house survives (and was resold in 2005) at Little Shelford, and who were there as early as 1300. But all appear to have generally had absentee landlords who sold copyhold lands and generally let others on long renewable leases. Farming survived at Great Shelford well into the 20th century. Several Yeoman families of note, the Deans, Howling, and Tunwell families, farmed here for centuries. One example is Richard Tunwell (1645‚Äì1713) who acquired land at Great Shelford, his first acquisition being a mere of pasture, a copse and a close which was copyhold land belonging to the Bury manor. When Freville's Manor was purchased [as superior proprietor] by William Freeman in 1701, the lands in Great Shelford belonging to the Manor were described as of arable, and a half a rood of meadow, of pasture, a sheepwalk or liberty of foldage and fold course for six store ewes, all by then in the occupation of Richard Tunwell. The Manor also had of meadow in Little Shelford which again was occupied by Richard Tunwell. A rent roll of the Manor of Granhams dated 1708 shows that Tunwell and his sons held copyhold land from that Manor as well. From 1678 onwards, Richard Tunwell served as a Juror on the Bury Baron Court. By 1705, as a landed proprietor, he had qualified as a parliamentary voter and the Poll Book for the election held in that year shows that he voted for Sir Richard Cullen and John Bromley. The Killingworth family also owned land at Shelford, as when Richard Killingworth of Great Bradley in Suffolk, gentleman, made his Will on 12 September 1586, he left the following legacies to the poor ‚Äì of Fulbourne ¬£10; Balsham (where his son John held the manor) ¬£10; GREAT SHELFORD ¬£5; LITTLE SHELFORD ¬£5; and Cambridge ¬£20. =Historical geography= Great Shelford was colonised by academics of the University of Cambridge in Victorian times; in the 20th century it became a home for commuters. However the original settlement pattern can still be traced. The core of the modern village lies between the sites of tow Anglo-Saxon settlements one of which itself occupied the site of a Romano-British village and the other was nearer to Little Shelford.Hadfield, John, ed. (1980) The Shell Book of English Villages. London: Michael Joseph; p. 126  Education  Shelford is home to Great and Little Shelford CofE (A) Primary School. It currently has around 200 pupils and obtained a \\"Good\\" Ofsted rating. The headteacher is Christopher Grey. Sport and activities Shelford's Rugby Union team, Shelford RFC, competes in the R.F.U.'s National League 2 South, and plays its home fixtures at its ground on Cambridge Road, in the north of the village. Great Shelford Cricket Club plays in the Cambridgeshire & Huntingdon Premier League Division 2. In 2017 the club boasts 3 Senior sides and 4 Junior teams. The first team finished a club record 3rd in the league, winning 8 games consecutively to conclude the 2017 season. The cricket club shares a ground with Cambridgeshire League football club, Great Shelford F.C.; however the Cricket Club played all home team first eleven fixtures at Cokenach CC for the 2018 season. Shelfords and Stapleford have a very active Scout Group with a Beaver Colony, a Cub Pack and a Scout Troop. GirlGuiding has a Guide group, Brownies and Rainbows. All these groups meet in the Scout and Guide HQ within the village. Notable people Great Shelford was home to children's author Philippa Pearce, who renamed it \\"Great Barley\\" (with the neighbouring village of Little Shelford becoming \\"Little Barley\\", and Cambridge itself becoming \\"Castleford\\" and losing its university) in her books, most notably Minnow on the Say (1955). In this and other books the River Cam, which flows through the village, became the River Say. The writer was brought up in Great Shelford and after some years in London lived there again from 1973 to her death in 2006. Sir Peter Hall, the theatrical director, lived in the station house as a child and the author Tom Sharpe had a house in the village. Barack Obama, a former President of the United States, traced his ancestry to the village in 2009, bringing Great Shelford into the national media. Events The \\"Shelford Festival and Feast\\" takes place every year in the 2nd week of July. The origins of the Shelford Feast date back to medieval times. The Feast continued until the Second World War, the last one being held in 1938 until revived in 1994. Since 1994 The Shelford Feast has been held every year until 2020 and by 2019 had donated ¬£338,000 to local good causes.

Early life White was born on 1 March 1918 in Lathpandura, near Kalutara, in British Ceylon, the second of four children of John Bernard White and Cecilia Hawk White, descended from principally British lineage. He had three brothers, Frederick A. White, also an athlete, Stanley Leonard White and Douglas Andrew White (died 1960). He was educated at Trinity College, Kandy where he was awarded 'Trinity Lion' for athletics; however, this was subsequently withdrawn for disciplinary reasons. He left Trinity in 1937. Sporting career He took part in 400-yard hurdles at the 1938 British Empire Games and became champion at national public schools championships, Ceylon championships and India- Ceylon championships. In 1948, he was selected for the team that represented Ceylon at that year's summer Olympics in London; the country had gained its independence from Britain that year. He won silver in the 400-meter hurdles, the first Olympic medal for Ceylon. He had trained for only about 3 months before the games while the gold medallist, Roy Cochran of the United States, had trained for about 4 years. White's time, 51.8 seconds, was only 0.7 seconds behind Cochran; both times bettered the existing Olympic record. After the Olympic victory, White was welcomed at a ceremony at Trinity College and was honoured with the return of his 'Lion'. In his speech at the special assembly, White said: \\"[A]lthough my victory at the Olympics is prestigious, the 'Lion' makes me feel more honoured than that\\", and received the 'Lion' with open arms. The Government of Ceylon awarded him a scholarship to Loughborough University, where he won the Inter-University Challenge Shield. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and awarded the Helms World Trophy as the \\"Most Outstanding Athlete\\" in Asia. In the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, New Zealand, White won the 440-yard hurdles, only 0.3 seconds behind the world record. Military career In 1942, with the on set of World War II, White was commissioned as an officer in the Ceylon Light Infantry. He was demobilised in 1947. He later joined the Ceylon Volunteer Force, going on to become a Major and gaining the Efficiency Decoration. Academic career After graduating from Loughborough, he returned to Ceylon in 1951 and was appointed the physical education lecturer at the Teacher's College in Maharagama. In 1958, the Department of Education appointed him coach of the Sri Lanka Schools Athletic Association. In 1963 he took up a post as lecturer at the University of Nigeria in 1963 and went on to become a senior lecturer at the University of Ibadan. He eventually settled in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, briefly returning to Nigeria as an advisor on sports activities. The Duncan White Sports Foundation was founded on his 72nd birthday, 1 March 1990, and White presented the first award to Sriyantha Dissanayake on 1 March 1991. Personal Life and Death White married Angela Siebel in 1952 and had six children: Maxine, Nita, Christopher, Dan, Marilyn and Fiona. He died in 1998 in Nuneaton, despite having said that he intended to migrate with his family to Australia. His wife remained in Nuneaton. =Honors= *Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) *Helms World Trophy *Awarded the title Deshamanya by the Government of Sri Lanka in 1998 *Depicted on a Sri Lankan postage stamp in 1988 See also *Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam *Sriyantha Dissanayake *Susanthika Jayasinghe References 1918 births 1998 deaths Alumni of Trinity College, Kandy Burgher military personnel Burgher sportspeople Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Athletes (track and field) at the 1938 British Empire Games Athletes (track and field) at the 1950 British Empire Games Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Sri Lanka Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics Members of the Order of the British Empire Olympic athletes of Sri Lanka Olympic silver medalists for Sri Lanka People from Western Province, Sri Lanka People of British Ceylon Ceylon Light Infantry officers Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force officers Sri Lankan male hurdlers Medalists at the 1948 Summer Olympics Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) Deshamanya ","title":"Duncan White"},{"id":"1203183","title":"Arisugawa-no-miya"},{"id":"1203196","text":"Neoclassical interior by Robert Adam, Syon House, London Details for Derby House in Grosvenor Square, an example of the Adam brothers' decorative designs. The Adam style (or Adamesque and \\"Style of the Brothers Adam\\") is an 18th-century neoclassical style of interior design and architecture, as practised by the three Scottish brothers Robert Adam (1728‚Äì1792), James Adam (1732‚Äì1794) and William Adam, of whom Robert and James were the most widely known. The Adam brothers advocated an integrated style for architecture and interiors, with walls, ceilings, fireplaces, furniture, fixtures, fittings and carpets all being designed by the Adams as a single uniform scheme. Commonly and mistakenly known as \\"Adams Style,\\" the proper term for this style of architecture and furniture is the \\"Style of the Adam Brothers.\\" The Adam style found its niche from the late 1760s in upper-class and middle-class residences in 18th-century England, Scotland, Russia (where it was introduced by Scottish architect Charles Cameron), and post-Revolutionary War United States (where it became known as Federal style and took on a variation of its own). The style was superseded from around 1795 onwards by the Regency style and the French Empire style. Background =Building boom= During the 18th century there was much work for eager architects and designers, as Britain experienced a boom in the building of new houses, theatres, shops, offices and factories, with towns growing rapidly due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The emphasis was on modernisation, with regulations being introduced to clean up the nation's streets, promoting the re-paving of roads and pavements, improving drainage and street lighting, and better fireproofing of buildings with the widespread use of brick and stone. Speculative building was rife, with some developers focussing on high speed and low cost. Sometimes, newly built houses collapsed due to poor workmanship; whilst others continually shifted on their foundations, giving rise to the phrase \\"things that go bump in the night\\", as mysterious crashes, creaks and thuds were heard by their inhabitants late at night. London experienced major expansion, with the newly built West End, which included the elegant squares of Mayfair; areas of the East End of London were also developed, such as the new terraces in Spitalfields. The cities of Edinburgh, Bristol and Dublin were all expanded and modernised. Birmingham was described in 1791 as being the \\"first manufacturing town in the world\\". Manchester and Liverpool each saw their population triple between 1760 and 1800. New towns, like Bath, were constructed around natural spas. Old medieval cities and market towns, such as York and Chichester, had their buildings re-fronted with brick or stucco, plus new sash windows, to give the impression of modernity, despite the underlying structures remaining medieval. =Pattern books and style guides= The Neoclassical style was all the vogue throughout the 18th century, and many style guides were published to advise builders how their finished properties should look. Influential guides included Stephen Riou's The Grecian Orders (1768), and Batty Langley's A Sure Guide to Builders (1729), The Young Builder's Rudiments (1730 and 1734), Ancient Masonry (1736), The City and Country Builder's and Workman's Treasury of Designs (1740 and later editions), The Builder's Jewel (1741). Architects, designers, cabinet makers, stonemasons, and craftsmen published pattern books and style guides to advertise their ideas, thereby hoping to attract a lucrative clientele. The Adam style Interior of Home House, designed by Robert Adam in 1777 The work of the Adam brothers set the style for domestic architecture and interiors for much of the latter half of the 18th century. Robert and James Adam travelled in Italy and Dalmatia in the 1750s, observing the ruins of the classical world. On their return to Britain, they set themselves up with their older brother, John, as architects. Robert and James published a book entitled The Works in Architecture in instalments between 1773 and 1779. This book of engraved designs made the Adam repertory available throughout Europe. The Adam brothers aimed to simplify the rococo and baroque styles which had been fashionable in the preceding decades, to bring what they felt to be a lighter and more elegant feel to Georgian houses. The Works in Architecture illustrated the main buildings the Adam brothers had worked on and crucially documented the interiors, furniture and fittings, designed by the Adams. A parallel development of this phase of neoclassical design is the French Louis XVI style. The All fake moved away from the strict mathematical proportions previously found in Georgian rooms, and introduced curved walls and domes, decorated with elaborate plasterwork and striking mixed colour schemes using newly affordable paints in pea green, sky blue, lemon, lilac, bright pink, and red-brown terracotta. Artists such as Angelica Kauffman and Antonio Zucchi were employed to paint classical figurative scenes within cartouches set into the interior walls and ceilings. The Adam's main rivals were James Wyatt, whose many designs for furniture were less known outside the wide circle of his patrons, because he never published a book of engravings; and Sir William Chambers, who designed fewer furnishings for his interiors, preferring to work with such able cabinet-makers as John Linnell, Thomas Chippendale, and Ince and Mayhew. So many able designers were working in this style in London from circa 1770 that the style is currently more usually termed Early Neoclassical. Robert Adam's design for the Etruscan Dressing Room, Osterley Park, 1773-74; the painted ornaments on the walls and ceilings are the work of Pietro Maria Borgnis, working for Adam. It was typical of Adam style to combine decorative neo-Gothic details into the classical framework. So-called \\"Egyptian\\" and \\"Etruscan\\" design motifs were minor features. The Adam style is identified with: * Classical Roman decorative motifs, such as framed medallions, vases, urns and tripods, arabesque vine scrolls, sphinxes, griffins, and dancing nymphs * Flat grotesque panels * Pilasters * Painted ornaments, such as swags and ribbons * Complex pastel colour schemes The Adam style was superseded from around 1795 onwards by the simpler Regency style in Britain; and the French Empire style in France and Russia, which was a more imperial and self- consciously archeological style, connected with the First French Empire. Influenced by The Adam Style was strongly influenced by: * Frescoes and wall paintings found in the newly excavated Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum * Greek black and red-figure painted vases, which were being excavated and collected in large numbers from Etruscan tombs in Italy, and then thought to be Etruscan. * Classical Greek architecture, which was known in Britain through publications such as James Stuart & Nicholas Revett's book The Antiquities of Athens published in 1762. Revival Gillows made in 1900 from a century old measured drawing Interest in the Adam style was revived in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, initiated by a spectacular marquetry cabinet by Wright & Mansfield exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1867. Reproduction furniture in the general \\"Regency Revival\\" style, to which the Adam revival was closely linked, was very popular with the expanding middle classes from circa 1880 to 1920. They were attracted to the light and elegant designs, as a contrast to the heavier and more cluttered interiors which had dominated their homes during the second half of the 19th century. The revival competed with the Arts and Crafts style, which continued to be popular in Britain up to the 1930s. The Adam and Regency revivals, however, lost mainstream momentum after World War I, being replaced by Art Deco in popular taste.

It has predominantly Georgian and Neo- Georgian architecture. For its first two hundred or so years it was one of the three or four most fashionable residential streets in London. It now has headquarters of a number of well-known businesses, including BP and Rio Tinto Group; four private members' clubs, the East India Club, the Naval and Military Club, the Canning Club, and the Army and Navy Club; the High Commission of Cyprus; the London Library; and global think tank and peace- promoter Chatham House. A main feature is a high, stone-plinthed equestrian statue of William III erected in 1808. History In 1662 Charles II extended a lease over the 45 acres of Pall Mall (St James's) Field held by Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans to 1720 and soon afterwards the earl began to lay out the property for development. The earl petitioned the king that the class of occupants they both hoped to attract to the new district would not take houses without the prospect of eventually acquiring them outright, and in 1665 the king granted the freehold of the site of St. James's Square and some closely adjacent parts of the field to the earl's trustees. The location was convenient for the royal palaces of Whitehall and St James. The houses on the east, north and west sides of the square were soon developed, each of them being constructed separately as was usual at that time. St James's Square circa 1752. In the 1720s seven dukes and seven earls were in residence. The east, north and western sides of the square contained some of the most desirable houses in London. At first glance they do not appear much different from most other houses in the fashionable parts of the West End, but this is deceptive. The windows were more widely spaced than most, the ceilings were high, and deep plots and ingenious planning allowed some of the houses to contain a very large amount of accommodation indeed (see the plans in the Survey of London extract linked below and note that this is not reflected in the extract from Horwood's map shown as he had no access to the interiors). Some of the houses had fine interiors by leading architects such as Matthew Brettingham, Robert Adam and John Soane. The southern side of the square was much more modest. The plots were just sixty feet deep and an average of 22 feet wide. They originally faced Pall Mall and had Pall Mall numbers (the modern reconstructions, which are mostly offices, have fronts to both the square and the street). The residents of these houses were not eligible to be trustees of the trust which administered the square or even to use the central garden. The idea of buying them out, demolishing their houses and leaving the space open to the Pall Mall was raised more than once, but never implemented. Things began to change by the 1830s with the arrival of club-houses, and in 1844 The Builder commented that the square was losing caste and the fashionable were migrating to Belgravia. By 1857 the square contained a bank, an insurance society, two government offices, the London Library, two lodging- houses and three clubs. However, some of the houses continued to be occupied by the fashionable and wealthy into the twentieth century. The Libyan embassy in St James's Square was the site of the 1984 Libyan Embassy Siege. According to a news report of the time: Addresses St James's Square in 1799 The numbering starts with Number 1 to the north of Charles Street on the eastern side of the square and proceeds anti-clockwise as far as Number 21. The Army and Navy Club's clubhouse occupies the former sites of Number 22, a smaller adjacent house which may have had a George Street number, and several former houses in Pall Mall. Norfolk House at the southern end of the square is Number 31, and the two houses to its north are Numbers 32 and 33. A small house in the angle of the square south of Norfolk House, originally numbered in John Street, and the adjacent house in Pall Mall, have been combined and allocated the number 31A. The smaller houses along the southern side had Pall Mall numbers until 1884. This block is now occupied by a mixture of 19th and 20th century buildings which are fully built up to the pavements on both sides. Some of them have their main entrance in Pall Mall and others in the square, and there are two separate sets of numbers for them. The numbers in the square range from 22A to 30, with some omissions. * No. 1: BP head office. Also occupies the site of the former No. 2 and several demolished houses in Charles Street. It is a post-modern building dating from c.2000 which defers to the Georgian style of the street. It was built to be Ericsson's London office and was sold to BP for ¬£117 million in 2001. * No. 3: The original house had many owners and tenants, including the holders of at least three separate dukedoms, and was worked on by various architects including John Soane. General Augustus Pitt-Rivers lived in the house as a child during the 1830s and 1840s. The present building is a 1930s office block. * No. 4: The Naval and Military Club in a Georgian house of 1726‚Äì28 by Edward Shepherd. Former home of Nancy Astor and the only house in the square to retain its large garden and the original mews house to the rear. * No. 5: Present house by Matthew Brettingham 1748‚Äì9.

Henry Flitcroft supervised number 10 and probably also numbers 9 and 11. No. 10 is Chatham House, former home of British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder and of the Earl and Countess of Blessington. There is a London County Council plaque on Number 10 stating \\"Here lived Three Prime Ministers WILLIAM PITT Earl of Chatham 1708‚Äì1778 Edward Geoffrey Stanley EARL OF DERBY 1799‚Äì1869 William Ewart GLADSTONE 1809‚Äì1898\\". * No. 12: Built 1836, probably by Thomas Cubitt.

The house was three bays wide and had three main storeys plus an attic. In 1936 it was extended to include the rebuilt No. 21 to its south, forming a uniform seven bay fa√ßade with an extra full storey on top. This address became the London offices for the enterprise software company Autonomy Corporation in December 2010. * (Former) No. 22 and adjacent buildings: replaced by the Army and Navy Club 1848‚Äì51. It had a bold Venetian exterior. This has been lost and the present building is in a mean mid 20th century style. In 1851 it was one of the residences of the Bishop of London, Charles James Blomfield. * Nos. 22A to 30: See above. Little historical or architectural significance, except that the now defunct Junior Carlton Club once occupied a grand clubhouse at the western end of the block. * No. 31: Norfolk House ‚Äì the London residence of the Dukes of Norfolk for many generations. Replaced between the wars with a neo-Georgian office building of the same name which was U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters during World War II, where Operation Torch and Operation Overlord were planned. * No. 32: Built by Samuel Pepys Cockerell and Charles Robert Cockerell in 1819‚Äì21. Later alterations. Used as offices. * No. 33: By Robert Adam (1770‚Äì72) replacing an earlier house. Altered by John Soane 1817‚Äì23. Later alterations including an additional storey, but still essentially Georgian. Used as offices. Gardens The gardens The gardens in the centre of the square are maintained and cared for by the St James's Square Trust, which receives its financial support from the building freeholders. The Trust was established by the Saint James' Square: Rates Act of 1726 (12 Geo. 1 c. 25), which authorised the freeholders to raise a rate on themselves to \\"clean, adorn and beautify\\" the square: this was the earliest statute passed to regulate a London square, and is the only one still in unamended operation. The gardens are normally open to the public on weekdays from 7.30am to 4.30pm, but are kept locked and accessible only to freeholders and residents at other times. They are used on an occasional basis as a venue for art exhibitions, weddings, and other functions.

Chelsea is located within Canada's National Capital Region. It is the seat of Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais Regional County Municipality. Its population was 6,909 in the 2016 Canadian Census. The population of Chelsea is almost evenly divided between anglophones and francophones and both English and French languages are in common use throughout the town. The municipality has a reputation for being environmentally responsible and was one of the first in Canada to ban the use of pesticides. While 60% of the area consists of Gatineau Park, much of the rest of Chelsea is residential with mostly large lots, and tracts of undeveloped land. It has a distinctly rural feel. A new sports complex, the Meredith Centre, was developed on the main road, neighboring the English Elementary School. The new complex hosts a hockey rink, community rooms, and soccer fields. Part of the film Grey Owl was shot on the Gatineau River. A number of regionally and nationally well-known musicians, filmmakers, and artists live in Chelsea, including Ian Tamblyn. Geography Chelsea is a triangle-shaped municipality that includes much of the southern and eastern parts of Gatineau Park, and is bordered on the east by the Gatineau River. The southern border is south of Old Chelsea, and it runs north to the community of Farm Point. Beyond Farm Point lies the municipality of La P√™che and the village of Wakefield. Just north of Old Chelsea is Camp Fortune, a popular alpine ski club 15 minutes from Downtown Ottawa. History Chelsea is named after the Vermont town of its first settler, Thomas Brigham, who was a partner and son-in-law of Philemon Wright and arrived there in 1819. The name has been in use since the early 19th century: Old Chelsea (1819), Parish Saint-Stephen- of-Chelsea (1835), Chelsea (circa 1870). In 1875, the municipality was established as Hull-Partie-Ouest, or commonly referred to as West Hull. The municipality was renamed to its current name in 1990. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy wanted to understand more about the propagation of radio waves and how they were affected by the earth's ionosphere in order that German radio transmissions could be intercepted in a more efficient manner. In co-operation with the National Research Council, the RCN established a \\"field intensity station\\" at Chelsea in 1941 to monitor the height of the ionosphere. Chelsea, also known as an ionospheric observatory, was established in 1941 and closed down in 1947. It was located on the north side of Old Chelsea Road a few hundred yards west of Highway 105. The Chelsea station operated during the post war period but in 1947, its work was transferred to the Defence Research Board's new Radio Propagation Laboratory in Ottawa. Shortly thereafter, the station was demolished. Today, there are no traces of the single shack or the many masts that were once erected on the property.

A self-taught musician, Thad began performing professionally at the age of 16. He served in U.S. Army bands during World War II (1943‚Äì46). After his military service, which included an association with the U.S. Military School of Music and working with area bands in Des Moines and Oklahoma City, Jones became a member of the Count Basie Orchestra in May 1954. He was featured as a soloist on such well-known tunes as \\"April in Paris\\", \\"Shiny Stockings\\" and \\"Corner Pocket\\". However, his main contribution to Basie's organization was nearly two dozen arrangements and compositions, which included \\"The Deacon\\", \\"H.R.H.\\" (Her Royal Highness ‚Äî in honor of the band's command performance in London), \\"Counter Block\\", and lesser known tracks such as \\"Speaking of Sounds\\". His hymn-like ballad \\"To You\\" was performed by the Basie band combined with the Duke Ellington Orchestra in their only recording together, and the recording Dance Along With Basie contains nearly an entire album of Jones' uncredited arrangements of standard tunes. In 1959 Jones played cornet on Thelonious Monk's 5 by Monk by 5 album. Jones left the Basie Orchestra in 1963 to become a freelance arranger and musician in New York City. In 1965 he and drummer Mel Lewis formed the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. The group started with informal late-night jam sessions among New York's top studio musicians. They began performing at the Village Vanguard in February 1966, to wide acclaim, and continued with Jones in the lead for 12 years. They won a 1978 Grammy Award for their album Live in Munich.LA Times, \\"The Envelope\\" awards database. (link) Retrieved April 30, 2008. Jones also taught at William Paterson College in New Jersey, which is now the site of the Thad Jones Archive, containing pencil scores and vintage photos as part of the Living Jazz Archives. In January 1979,Smith, Chris (2014). The View From The Back Of The Band: The Life and Music of Mel Lewis. University of North Texas Press. p. 196-198. . Thad suddenly moved to Copenhagen, Denmark (to the great surprise of his New York bandmates), where several other U.S. jazz musicians had gone to live. There he became the leader of The Danish Radio Big Band, and married a Danish woman (Lis). Jones transformed the Danish Radio Big Band into one of the world's best. The result can be heard on a live-recording from the Montmartre in Copenhagen. In July 1979 Jones formed a new big band, Eclipse, with which he recorded a live album, Eclipse.A Review of Thad Jones' Eclipse Jazztimes, Edition January/February 2005, reviewed by Harvey Siders. Several Americans were on the album: pianist Horace Parlan, baritonist Sahib Shihab, trumpeter Tim Hagans and trombonist/vocalist Richard B. Boone, along with trombonists Bjarne Thanning and Ture Larsen, trumpeter Lars Togeby, altoists Ole Th√∏ger and Michael Hove, tenor saxophonist Bent J√¶dig, and Jesper Lundgaard on bass. Jones further composed for the Danish Radio Big Band and taught jazz at the Royal Danish Conservatory in Copenhagen. He studied composition formally during this period, and also took up the valve trombone. In February 1985, Jones returned to the U.S. to take over the leadership of the Count Basie Orchestra, upon his former leader's death. Thad fronted the Basie band on numerous tours, also writing arrangements for recordings and performances with vocalist Caterina Valente and the Manhattan Transfer, but had to step down due to ill health. He returned to his home in Copenhagen for the last few months of his life, and died of cancer on August 20, 1986, at Herlev Hospital.Lis Jones In later years his playing ability was diminished due to lip injury, but his composing and arranging skills blossomed. His best- known composition is the standard \\"A Child Is Born\\". At the time of his death, Jones had a six-year-old son, also named Thad (Thaddeus Joseph William Jones), with his wife Lis Jones. He had a daughter Thedia and a son Bruce in the U.S. He was buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Kirkeg√•rd Cemetery (Western Churchyard Cemetery).Reuters.

The Swiss Cancer League described Hamer's approach as \\"dangerous, especially as it lulls the patients into a false sense of security, so that they are deprived of other effective treatments.\\" Hamer held a licence to practice medicine from 1963 until 1986, when it was revoked for malpractice. His system came to public attention in 1995, when the parents of a child suffering from cancer refused medical treatment in favour of Hamer's methods. Hamer was charged with malpractice and imprisoned in several European countries. Hamer claimed that his method is a \\"Germanic\\" alternative to mainstream clinical medicine, which he claimed is part of a Jewish conspiracy to decimate non-Jews. Biography Ryke Geerd Hamer was born in Mettmann, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in 1935. He received his high school diploma at age 18 and started medical and theological studies in T√ºbingen, where he met Sigrid Oldenburg, a medical student who later became his wife. At age 20, Hamer passed the preliminary examination in medicine, and in April 1962 passed his medical state examination in Marburg, Hesse. He was granted a professional license as a doctor of medicine in 1963. After spending a number of years at the University Clinics of T√ºbingen and Heidelberg, Hamer completed his specialization in internal medicine in 1972. He also worked in several practices with his wife and patented several inventions. Hamer's license to practice medicine was revoked in 1986 by a court judgment, which was reconfirmed in 2003. As he continued to practice, Hamer was investigated several times over allegations of malpractice and causing the deaths of patients.case file number 34 Js 85/86 ‚Äì 34 Js 178/95 ‚Äì 34 Js 221/96 Public Prosecution Service Cologne He was jailed for twelve months in Germany from 1997 to 1998, and served a prison term from September 2004 to February 2006 in Fleury-M√©rogis, France, on counts of fraud and illegal practicing. Hamer subsequently lived in voluntary exile in Spain until March 2007, when Spanish medical authorities held him responsible for dozens of preventable deaths.. New URL: , retrieved 15 July 2017. By 1997, Hamer owned clinics in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the Netherlands, and resided in Norway until his death from a stroke on 2 July 2017, age 82. Germanic New Medicine On 8 August 1978, Hamer's son, Dirk, was shot by the son of the last king of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, while asleep on a yacht off Cavallo and died on 7 December of that year. Some time after Dirk's death, Hamer began to develop Germanic New Medicine (GNM), which can be summarized in its \\"five biological laws\\": * 1st law (\\"Iron Rule\\"): Severe diseases originate from a shock event which is experienced by the individual as very difficult, highly acute, dramatic and isolating. The shock‚Äôs psychological conflict content determines the location of the appearance of a focus of activity in the brain that can be seen in a CT scan as a set of concentric rings, called \\"Hamer foci\\", which correspond to the location of the disease in the body. The subsequent development of the conflict determines the development of both the brain focus and the disease. * 2nd law (Two phased nature of disease): A patient who has not solved their conflict is in the first, active conflict phase, where the sympathetic nervous system predominates and which manifests as a \\"cold disease\\" accompanied by cold skin and extremities, stress, weight loss and sleep disorders. If they manage to resolve the conflict, they enter a second, post-resolution healing phase, in which the parasympathetic nervous system predominates, commonly diagnosed as a separate \\"warm\\" (rheumatic, infectious, allergic, etc.) disease. This second phase is the one which usually entails more risks, and a complete cure only comes upon its completion. In some circumstances, not solving the conflict but downgrading it to a reasonably livable level may be preferable than facing the second phase. * 3rd law (Ontogenetic system of diseases): Hamer proposes that disease progression is primarily controlled by the brain, either by the \\"old brain\\" (brainstem and cerebellum) or the \\"new brain\\" (cerebrum). The old brain controls more primitive processes, having to do with basic survival, such as breathing, eating, and reproduction, whereas the new brain manages more advanced personal and social issues, such as territorial conflicts, separation conflicts and self-devaluation and identity conflicts. Hamer's research is tied to the science of embryology because he links the type of disease progression‚Äîwhether involving tissue augmentation (tumor growth), tissue loss (necrosis or ulceration) or functional impairment‚Äîwith the embryonic germ layer (endoderm, mesoderm or ectoderm) from which both the organ tissues and the corresponding brain regions originate. Conflicts which have their focus either in the brain stem (which controls body tissues that derive from the endoderm) or the cerebellum (which controls tissues that derive from the mesoderm) show cell multiplication in the conflict active phase, and destruction of the resulting tumors in the healing phase. Cerebrum directed conflicts (affecting the rest of mesoderm-derived tissues and all ectoderm-derived ones) show either cell decrease (necroses, ulcers) or function impairment or interruption in the active phase, and the replenishment of the damaged tissues in the healing phase (which can also be diagnosed as a tumor). * 4th law (Ontogenetic system of microbes): Microbes do not cause diseases but are used by the body, coordinated by the brain, to optimize the healing phase, provided that the required microbes are available when needed. Fungi and mycobacteria work on tissues that originated in the endoderm, as well as on some of the tissues originating in the mesoderm. Bacteria work on all mesoderm derived tissues and viruses on ectoderm derived ones. Hamer maintains that these microbes, rather than being antagonistic to the body, actually perform a necessary role in healing, and that some of the interventions of conventional medicine are counterproductive, by interfering with these natural processes. * 5th law (\\"Quintessence\\"): The conflict active phase and the healing phase of diseases, as described above, constitute \\"special meaningful programs of nature,\\" developed during the evolution of the species, to allow organisms to override everyday functioning in order to deal with particular emergency situations. Therefore, according to Hamer, no real diseases exist; rather, what established medicine calls a \\"disease\\" is actually a \\"special meaningful program of nature\\" (sinnvolles biologisches Sonderprogramm) to which bacteria, viruses and fungi belong. Hamer's GNM claims to explain every disease and treatment according to those premises, and to thereby obviate traditional medicine. The cure is always the resolving of the conflict. Some treatments like chemotherapy or pain relieving drugs like morphine are deadly according to Hamer. These \\"laws\\" are dogmas of GNM, not laws of nature or medicine, and are at odds with scientific understanding of human physiology.Another cancer tragedy in the making, David Gorski, Science Based Medicine Olivia Pilhar case In 1995, Hamer was associated with the case of Olivia Pilhar, a six- year-old Austrian girl who suffered from Wilms' tumor. Pilhar's parents consulted Hamer, who diagnosed the girl as having several \\"conflicts\\" rather than cancer. When the parents refused conventional medical therapy for Pilhar, the Austrian government removed their rights of care and control. The parents fled with their daughter to Spain, which was Hamer's place of residence at the time. After negotiations, including the intervention of the Austrian President Thomas Klestil, the parents were persuaded to return to Austria. By then, Pilhar's health had deteriorated. The tumor had grown very large, weighing four kilograms, filling most of her abdominal cavity and was pressing against her lungs. The lack of treatment had reduced the estimate of survival probability from 90% to 10%. After a court ordered conventional cancer treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, Pilhar recovered completely and was still alive in 2010. Her parents received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in Austria. Jewish conspiracy theory Hamer purported that his method is a \\"Germanic\\" alternative to mainstream clinical medicine, which he claimed is part of a Jewish conspiracy to decimate non- Jews.An example among many: Germanische Heilkunde: Interview, 4 November 2009 (Internet Archive, 6 May 2016). See: Alma Fatmi, 'Die ideologischen Hintergr√ºnde der Germanischen Neuen Medizin', in: Udo Schuster (ed.), Rassismus im neuen Gewand. Herausforderungen im Kommunikationszeitalter 4.0, M√ºnchen 2017, p. 81-112. In this, Hamer repeated the antisemitic claims of Nazi physician Gerhard Wagner. More precisely, Hamer asserted that chemotherapy and morphine are used to \\"mass murder\\" Western civilisation, while such treatment is not used in Israel. Hamer promoted the idea that most German oncologists are Jewish and that \\"no Jew is treated with chemotherapy in Germany\\". According to him, hypodermic needles are used during chemotherapy to implant \\"chips\\" containing \\"chambers of poison\\" that can be activated by satellite to specifically kill patients.Report M√ºnchen: Todesfalle Germanische Neue Medizin. ARD, 18. Januar 2010 He proposed that the swine flu vaccination campaign of 2009 was also used to mark people with those \\"chips\\" and denied the existence of HIV.Ryke Geerd Hamer: \\"HIV ist eine ganz normale Allergie\\" Der Standard, 14. Januar 2012 Hamer also believed that the denial of recognition of his theories and the revocation of his practitioner's licence is due to a Jewish conspiracy.Germanisch gegen Krebs, TAZ 30 January 2006 In 2008, Hamer presented a document where one \\"Chief Rabbi\\" \\"Esra\\" Iwan G√∂tz confirmed the existence of a conspiracy among Jewish oncologists to use the \\"torture\\" of chemotherapy on all non-Jewish patients, while Jewish patients were to receive the \\"correct\\" treatment of GNM. G√∂tz, a German holocaust denier active in the German Reich revivalism scene, has been repeatedly convicted by German courtsHe received a suspended eight-month sentence for Volksverhetzung from an Anklam court in 2009. Acht Monate auf Bew√§hrung f√ºr Leugnen des Holocaust (mirrored Nordkurier article of 27 January 2009) for fraud, defamation, misuse of academic titles (the title \\"Chief Rabbi\\" is not legally protected in Germany), and the falsification of documents, among others.Skandal um Holocaust-Leugnung in Anklam, indimedia.org, 19 January 2007. Response to medical views The Swiss Cancer League of the Swiss Society for Oncology, Swiss Society for Medical Oncology and Swiss Institute for Applied Cancer Research say that no case of a cancer cure by Hamer has been published in the medical literature, nor any studies in specialised journals. Reports in his books \\"lack the additional data that are essential for medical assessment\\" and the presentations of his investigations, at medical conferences \\"are scientifically unconvincing\\". Additionally, the German Cancer Research Center,Krebsinformationsdienst des Deutschen Krebsforschungszentrums Heidelberg √ºber die \\"Therapie nach Hamer\\" (PDF, Stand 2006 ) the German Cancer Society, the German Medical Association and German Consumer Councils strongly disagree with Hamer. Proponents of alternative cancer treatments also regard Hamer's theory skeptically and argue for supportive evidence and proven patient cases. Hamer's habilitation thesis about the GNM at the University of T√ºbingen was rejected after multiple examinations by several members of the medical faculty, who came to the conclusion that his work lacks scientific methods and reproducibility and his arguments do not back up his theories. Hamer replied that his system is verifiable and that the University of Trnava in Slovakia and has already confirmed some of his theories. In fact, the University of Trnava has no real medical faculty and the documents which allegedly confirm his view are not available and registered at the university.Correspondence on Pilhars Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20060216141824/http://www.pilhar.com/Hamer/Korrespo/1999/990114.htmThe university has a faculty specialized only in social work and healthcare/nursing http://www.truni.sk/fakulty The university also rejected his habilitation thesis.Correspondence on Pilhars page: https://web.archive.org/web/20060216141839/http://www.pilhar.com/Hamer/Korrespo/1999/990208.htm The Hamer foci that Hamer saw in the brain CTs are identified by radiologists as common ring artifacts.Statement of the German Radiologist Association/Deutschen R√∂ntgengesellschaft ‚Äì CT-Untersuchungen des Gehirns zur Detektion \\"Hamer'scher Herde\\" (Deutsche R√∂ntgengesellschaft) The medical establishment in Germany and the European Union warns of the threat posed to patients by Hamer's therapies.

The Scarecrow Press, inc.: Lanham, Maryland; Toronto; Oxford, 2004, p. 3. However Thomas L. Kane writes that Abebe \\"was born in xoru district, Shoa, in 1890/1897-8\\", that is 1890 E.C./AD 1897-8. (\\"The Nasi-Ras Abb√§b√§ Ar√§gay Truce according to Two Amharic Sources\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 39 (1976), p. 49 - 17 December 1960) was an Ethiopian military commander who, during the Italian occupation, led a group of resistance fighters (collectively known as the Arbegnoch or \\"Patriots\\") that operated in Menz and Shewa. He later served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia from 27 November 1957 until his death. He was a victim of the unsuccessful 1960 Ethiopian coup. Abebe was the grandchild of the famous Oromo chief Ras Gobena Dache, whose 1880s military expeditions led to the expansion of Ethiopia‚Äôs modern borders. Early life Abebe was born on 18 August 1903 in the village of Woira Amba-Jirru in northern Shewa. His father was Aregai Bechere (Shoa Amhara) and his mother was Askale Gobena, daughter of Ras Gobena Dacche. He served in the Kebur Zabagna, rising to the rank of Major before transferring to the police, and by 1935 had been granted the title of Balambaras.Kane, \\"Nasi-Ras Abb√§b√§ Ar√§gay Truce\\", p. 49 He was the chief of police of Addis Ababa when the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1936.  Life as an Arbegna  Balambaras Abebe remained in the capital after the departure of Emperor Haile Selassie but departing for the northeast with ten men before the Italians occupied the capital.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), p. 138 He took part in the unsuccessful attempt to retake the capital in July of that year, and his soldiers almost reached the Imperial Palace before being beaten back by two Italian battalions.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, pp. 159f After this action, Abebe's activities are hard to follow due to contradictory evidence. This is due in large part to the reticence of the survivors in their memoirs about individuals and events: when Emperor Haile Selassie proclaimed a general amnesty upon his restoration, as Thomas L. Kane explains, \\"many of those who served the Italians loyally right up to the last minute took advantage of this proclamation to escape punishment, and ... [often achieved] positions of power.... In order to avoid offending one of these figures, or even the loyal relatives of some collaborator, the name of a principal in some incident will be deliberately omitted, though some reason such as 'this would be a humiliation for Ethiopia' may be given.\\"Kane, \\"Nasi-Ras Abb√§b√§ Ar√§gay Truce\\", p. 47 According to Anthony Mockler, by the spring of 1937 year Abebe was left with only 40 men, forcing him to limit his activities to the mountainous region of Menz.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 183n However, Thomas Kane writes that after Lij Haile Maryam Mammo's victory at Morit on 21 April 1937, Abebe and Fitawrari Zawdu Abba Koran took control of Morat and Geru, then on 25 July the three joined with Blatta Tekle Walde-Hawaryat and Major Masfon Selassie for an attack on Addis Alem; however they encountered the enemy far to the east of their intended target, and increasing enemy forces and aerial bombardments forced them to withdraw to Menz 1 September.Kane, \\"Nasi-Ras Abb√§b√§ Ar√§gay Truce\\", p. 50 Returning to Mockler's narrative, in May 1937 Abebe ventured out of Menz to proclaim Meleke Tsahai, the 16-year-old son of the late Lij Iyasu emperor at the Three Ambas, alarming the Italian occupiers. (Kane does agree with Mockler that Abebe did cooperate with Meleke Tsahai, meeting with him 27 November.) On 1 June, General Ugo Cavallero moved north to surround Abebe, and keep him from returning to Menz, and although Abebe made three unsuccessful attempts to break through the Italian lines before the rainy season, after the rains his Arbegnoch were able to return to the comparative safety of Menz. Although Meleke Tsahai died not long afterwards of illness, Abebe remained at large, and following the death of Olana Dingili (1939), became the leading rebel leader ‚Äì although one not entirely trusted by the exiled Emperor Haile Selassie. Abebe presented himself to the Italians as ambivalent about his role as an Arbegna, always seeming to be at the point of submitting to the occupiers in return for money, arms, honors or power, yet always changing his mind at the last moment.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, pp. 201f \\"In negotiations he conducted with General Nasi, then deputy viceroy and governor of Shewa, Abebe gave intimations of his readiness to surrender. Simultaneously, he wrote to other patriotic leaders explaining the actual reason for engaging in the talks: to buy time. After he had made sure that his forces had sufficiently recovered from the reverses they had suffered in the preceding months, he broke off negotiations, using as a pretext the killing by the Italians of patriots in another locality.\\"Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), pp. 172f. The Italians continued these talks, obsessed with the hope of recruiting the best-known resistance fighter to their side, until 15 March 1940, when General Nasi learned that Abebe Aregai, who had promised to take the oath of allegiance if the General would make a visit to his location in person, was laying an ambush for him with 20,000 men.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 202 It was not until Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia that he was let in on the secret. As the Emperor entered Addis Ababa with his entourage, the streets were lined with Abebe's men, cheering their returning Emperor. Abebe presented himself and his son to the Emperor, and Mockler reports that the Arbegna told Emperor Haile Selassie, bowing low before him, \\"I am your loyal subject. I never submitted to the enemy. I never hoped to see you alive again and I am grateful to God for this day, when I have seen the sun shine.\\"Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 379  Later career  Now Ras, Abebe Aregai proved to be a valuable retainer to the Emperor. One of the few Arbegnoch to receive a major government post, Ras Abebe was appointed governor of Addis Ababa and Minister of War in 1941 soon after Haile Selassie's return. He was subsequently made governor of Sidamo province from 1941 to 1942.David Hamilton Shinn, \\"Abebe Aregai, Ras,\\", p. 3 When the Woyane rebellion broke out in Tigray in 1942, with the rebels under Fitawrari Yeebio Weldai of Enderta known popularly as \\"Wedi Weldai\\" at one point capturing Mek'ele, Ras Abebe marched north to suppress the violence with the help of British air power, and captured the rebel headquarters at Wukro on 17 October 1943. The Emperor subsequently made him governor of Tigray, and Ras Abebe brutally pacified the province.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 251 After serving as governor, Ras Abebe once again served as Minister of War (1947‚Äì1949), Minister of the Interior (1949‚Äì1955), and Minister of Defence before becoming Prime Minister.Henze, Layers of Time, p. 239 Ras Abebe Aregai. Picture taken December 1959, at the inauguration of Building College in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. By the late 1950s, he had become the leader of one of the major factions that vied for the Emperor's favor; the others were led by potentiates who included Makonnen Habte-Wold (brother of Aklilu Habte-Wold), Ras Andargachew Masai and General Mulugeta Bulli. Thus, when the brothers Mengistu Neway and Germame, supported by the Imperial Bodyguard and the government security force, seized control of the capital on 13 December 1960, these three men and Ras Abebe were taken hostage. The rest of the military, however, remained loyal to the Emperor, and rushed to Addis Ababa and crushed the coup, although many of the hostages, including Ras Abebe Aregai, were killed by machine-gun fire as the army stormed the Genetta Leul palace on 17 December. Although the leaders of the coup had fled, they did not outlive the Ras by more than a week.Henze, Layers of Time, pp. 254f.

The technique attempts to make the player's input feel more instantaneous while governing the player's actions on a remote server. The process of client-side prediction refers to having the client locally react to user input before the server has acknowledged the input and updated the game state. So, instead of the client only sending control input to the server and waiting for an updated game state in return, the client also, in parallel with this, predicts the game state locally, and gives the user feedback without awaiting an updated game state from the server. Client-side prediction reduces latency problems, since there no longer will be a delay between input and client-side visual feedback due to network ping times. However, it also introduces a desynchronization of the client and server game states, which needs to be handled to keep the game playable. Usually, the desync is corrected when the client receives the updated game state, but as instantaneous correction would lead to \\"snapping\\", there are usually some \\"smoothing\\" algorithms involved. For example, one common smoothing algorithm would be to check each visible object's client-side location to see if it is within some error epsilon of its server-side location. If not, the client-side's information is updated to the server-side directly (snapped because of too much desynchronization). However, if the client-side location is not too far, a new position between the client- side and server-side is interpolated; this position is set to be within some small step delta from the client-side location, which is generally judged to be \\"small enough\\" to be unintrusive to the user. Another solution to the desynchronization issue, commonly used in conjunction with client-side prediction, is called server reconciliation.Gabriel Gambetta, Client-Side Prediction and Server Reconciliation The client includes a sequence number in every input sent to the server, and keeps a local copy. When the server sends an authoritative update to a client, it includes the sequence number of the last processed input for that client. The client accepts the new state, and reapplies the inputs not yet processed by the server, completely eliminating visible desynchronization issues in most cases. The earliest known first- person shooter to use client-side prediction is Duke Nukem 3D, which had it built-in since the January 29, 1996 shareware release. The technique was also a prominent feature of QuakeWorld, the popular add-on to Quake. While network play was included in the original Quake game, it was optimized mainly for LAN play. Having had high-speed home connections (a rarity at the time), Quake's designers overlooked their assumptions of high bandwidth and low ping times that made playing online frustrating for dial-up users.John Carmack, QuakeWorld .plan After a series of experiments in a long private beta, id Software released QuakeWorld with a new predictive model that proved popular with both high and low latency players.

National routes in South Africa are a class of trunk roads and freeways which connect major cities. They form the highest category in the South African route numbering scheme, and are designated with route numbers beginning with \\"N\\", from N1 to N18. Most segments of the national route network are officially proclaimed National Roads that are maintained by the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL), but some segments are maintained by provincial or local road authorities.https://www.nra.co.za/live/content.php?Item_ID=96 The system was mostly built during the 1970s by the National Party government of South Africa, although construction of new roads and repairs of existing stretches continue today. The system was modeled on the United States Interstate Highway network, an idea first brought into effect by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1950s, based on the German Autobahn, which he experienced when touring Germany after the Second World War. Although the terms National Road and National Route are sometimes regarded as synonymous, they have distinct meanings, and not all national routes are National Roads, while some \\"R\\"-numbered routes are proclaimed National Roads. Definition National routes are defined and numbered by the Route Numbering and Road Traffic Signs Sub Committee within the Roads Co-ordinating Body, an organisation which contains representatives from road authorities in national, provincial and local government. The term \\"national road\\" is frequently used to refer to a national route, but technically a \\"national road\\" is any road maintained by the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) and need not necessarily form part of a national route, and there are \\"R\\" routes that are proclaimed National Roads. There are also parts of the national route network that are maintained by provincial or local authorities rather than SANRAL.nra.co.za - Declaration List of routes National Routes are denoted with the letter N followed by a number indicating the specific route.

Following trials on Lake Michigan, Macabi, on 19 April, entered a floating drydock at Lockport, Ill., to transit the Chicago Canal to the Mississippi River, and arrived New Orleans 26 April. Three days later she left for shakedown operations off Panama. On 3 June Macabi departed Balboa, Canal Zone, for final training at Pearl Harbor before departing 9 July for the Caroline Islands via Guam, Marianas. She went on lifeguard station off Truk on arriving 21 July. Some 10 days later Macabi was forced to dive to avoid two aerial bombs off Moen Island. She returned to Apra Harbor, Guam, for repairs 4 August through 13 August; and was on her way back to Truk when hostilities with Japan were terminated.

In addition to publishing magazines and books, the Naval Institute holds several annual conferences. Established in 1873, the Naval Institute currently has about 50,000 members, mostly active and retired personnel of the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The organization also has members in over 90 countries. The organization has no official or funding ties to the United States Naval Academy or the U.S. Navy, although it is based on the grounds of the Naval Academy through permission granted by a 1936 Act of Congress. The Naval Institute's mission is \\"to provide an independent forum for those who dare to read, think, speak, and write to advance the professional, literary, and scientific understanding of sea power and other issues critical to global security\\". The Institute also has a Vision of \\"[g]iving voice to those who seek the finest Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.\\" History On October 9, 1873, 15 naval officers gathered at the U.S. Naval Academy's Department of Physics and Chemistry building in Annapolis to discuss the implications of a smaller, post-Civil War Navy and other matters of professional interest. The U.S. Naval Institute was established as a forum for the exchange of ideas, to disseminate and advance the knowledge of sea power, and to preserve U.S. naval and maritime heritage. Rear Admiral John L. Worden (former commander of the USS Monitor) served as the first president. In 1874, the Naval Institute began to accept papers and publish the \\"proceedings\\" of its discussions which were distributed to the organization's members, a practice that continues. Two decades later, the Naval Institute Press was created to publish basic naval guides; it eventually expanded to publish more general-interest titles in history, biography and current affairs. In 1992, the Naval Institute Foundation, Inc., was established to stabilize the organization's funding. Having outgrown its offices at Preble Hall, the Naval Institute gave the building to the Naval Academy and, in 1999, renovated a derelict Navy hospital to serve as its new headquarters. The building was named Beach Hall to honor the contributions of Captain Edward L. Beach Jr. (author of over a dozen books including Run Silent, Run Deep) and his father and namesake, Captain Edward L. Beach Sr., who had served as the Institute's secretary-treasurer. Publications and products =Proceedings= The monthly magazine Proceedings is the Naval Institute's flagship product. Published since 1874, it is one of the oldest continuously published magazines in the United States. Issues include articles from military professionals and civilian experts, historical essays, book reviews, full-color photography, and reader commentary. Roughly a third are written by active duty and active reserve personnel, a third by retired military, and a third by civilians. Proceedings also frequently carries feature articles by Secretaries of Defense, Secretaries of the Navy, Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and top leaders of the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. The magazine has published controversial articles on contentious issues; moreover, military brass have been known to block certain articles from being submitted to the journal. For example, in 1962, DoD officials prevented a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel from sending to Proceedings an article about a 1949 proposal to merge the Marines' aviation units into the Air Force. =Naval History= Naval History magazine was first published in 1987 to explore the role of sea power in U.S. history. Currently a bimonthly publication, the richly illustrated magazine's contributors have included historians David McCullough and James M. McPherson; former sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen such as Ernest Borgnine, Gene Hackman, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.; and newsmen Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw. =Naval Institute Press= The Naval Institute Press was founded in 1898 and publishes about 80 books a year. Its twice-yearly catalog includes works on history, biography, professional military education, and occasional works of popular fiction, such as Tom Clancy's first novel, The Hunt for Red October and Stephen Coonts' Flight of the Intruder. Among the professional development titles are The Bluejacket's Manual, Naval Shiphandling, The Naval Officer's Guide, The Marine Officer‚Äôs Guide, and The Coast Guardsman‚Äôs Manual. The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World and The Naval Institute Guide to Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet are popular reference books with the military, media and maritime enthusiasts. =USNI News= Launched in February 2012, USNI News provides breaking news and insight on emerging issues.

Also, Seti's daughter was named Tia. It can be assumed that Tia and Sitre are the same person and that she altered her name when her husband became pharaoh, just like he changed his name from Paramessu to Ramesses. The fact that one of the daughters of Ramesses II was named Tia- Sitre makes it even more likely.

Ballard. Published in 1961, it was his debut novel. He had previously published only short stories. The novel was the first of a series of Ballard novels dealing with scenarios of natural disaster. Here, civilization is reduced to ruins by prolonged worldwide hurricane force winds. As an added dimension, Ballard explores the ways in which disaster and tragedy can bond people together in ways that no normal experiences ever could. That is another recurring theme in his works and makes one of its first appearances here. Some critics have suggested that his first four novels are based on elemental themes, showing global destruction by air, water, fire and earth. Ballard later dismissed the novel, written in ten days, as a \\"piece of hackwork\\", referring instead to The Drowned World as his first real novel. Plot summary A wind blows worldwide: it is constantly westward and strongest at the equator. The wind is gradually increasing, and at the beginning of the story, the force of the wind is making air travel impossible. Later, people are living in tunnels and basements, unable to go above ground. Near the end, \\"The air stream carried with it enormous quantities of water vapour ‚Äî in some cases the contents of entire seas, such as the Caspian and the Great Lakes, which had been drained dry, their beds plainly visible.\\"Chapter 7. In London, to cope with the situation, special organizations are set up. The Central Operations Executive (COE), staffed mainly by War Office personnel, has been set up by Simon Marshall. Combined Rescue Operations deal with collapsing buildings. Donald Maitland, a doctor unable to travel to a new job in Canada because of the wind, is part of it. Maitland rescues Marshall when he is injured by falling masonry and takes him home to recover. In the basement of Marshall's home, Maitland sees military equipment labelled \\"Hardoon Tower\\" and wonders whose interests Marshall is really serving. Hardoon Tower is a pyramid-like structure intended to withstand the wind; it is being built by Hardoon, a millionaire businessman, who has a private army. Maitland's relationship with his wife Susan is ending, but when he hears that she is still in their apartment on an upper floor, while most people are underground, he goes there. Susan will not be persuaded to leave, and standing by an open window, she is carried away by the wind. As the destruction increases in London, COE decides to abandon its underground base. One of Hardoon's officers, a helmeted, taciturn figure called Kroll, arrives. Marshall thinks he is there to take him to Hardoon Tower, but Kroll kills him. Maitland is evacuated from the underground base along with Steve Lanyon, an American submarine captain, and Patricia Olsen, a journalist. Lanyon and Olsen have developed a relationship during recent experiences in Italy. They are in a group that leaves in a giant armoured vehicle with a periscope. Maitland, realizing they are passing close to Hardoon Tower and wanting to investigate it, sabotages the navigation equipment so that the vehicle goes to the tower, which they can locate by a radio signal. Hardoon receives the group so that Olsen, the journalist, can report his success. The pyramid, built over tunnels which are collapsing, starts to fall over in the wind, and Hardoon, gazing at the wind through a special window, cannot be saved. Maitland and the others, trying to escape from the destruction, realize that they are saved because the wind is starting to subside.

He took part in creative directing positions within the entertainment industry in Hong Kong. Wong died on 24 November 2004 of lung cancer after a four-year battle at the age of 63. Early life and education Wong was born Wong Jum-sum () in Panyu, in what now is part of Guangzhou, China. He migrated to Hong Kong with his family in 1949. He completed his secondary education at La Salle College. In 1963, he graduated from the Chinese Department, Faculty of Arts of the University of Hong Kong. Wong received an MPhil degree from the University of Hong Kong in 1983 for his study in Cantonese opera. In May 2003, in the midst of his fight with lung cancer, he obtained a PhD degree from the Department of Sociology, University of Hong Kong. The title of his thesis was \\"The Rise and Decline of Cantopop : A Study of Hong Kong Popular Music (1949‚Äì1997)\\". Career and contributions Exhibition of Dr. James Wong's works during University of Hong Kong's CAS Openday in October 2005 Music Blanket is one of James Wong's favourite personal collection Wong participated in a variety of media fields including advertising, movies and music. Nicknamed a \\"genius\\" () for his prodigious abilities, he was best known for his achievements as a lyricist of Cantonese songs in Hong Kong. Beginning from the 1960s, he was the lyricist for over 2,000 songs, collaborating with composer Joseph Koo (a.k.a. Gu Gaa-fai) on many popular TVB TV drama theme songs, many of which have become classics of the genre. His works pushed the development of Cantopop to unprecedented popularity. While well known and praised for his creative works in the entertainment and advertisement fields, Wong was also famous for his vulgar and indelicate jokes. He had a series of best-selling joke books. He was regarded as responsible for breaking the barrier to many cultural taboos in Hong Kong during the conservative environment in the 1970s. He is best remembered as the person who came up with the slogan \\"Two kids are good enough\\" for The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong. Wong hosted several TV programs, mostly interviews or talk shows oriented towards adults, on both TVB and ATV. One of the talk shows called \\"Off-guard Tonight\\" (‰ªäÂ§ú‰∏çË®≠Èò≤), co- hosted by Wong and his close friends Chua Lam and Ni Kuang on ATV, is particularly remembered. As a singer, he is a tenor with 2.5 octaves in chest voice due to him being a heavy smoker. In the 1990s, Wong's creative works became less popular, and many entertainment companies featured fewer of Wong's songs. Some TV shows hosted by Wong were also unpopular. Wong decided to return to Hong Kong University to get a doctorate degree in Hong Kong popular culture. His dissertation essay is now in the library of Hong Kong University. On 24 November 2004, Wong died at the Union Hospital in Hong Kong. His funeral was a low-key family funeral as per his wishes. Hong Kong citizens reflected on his career and accomplishments during this time. In the following days, the news of his death became the primary media headline in Hong Kong, and his compositions were played throughout the week. A remembrance ceremony took place at Hong Kong Stadium, with over 15,000 attending this ceremony.  Personal life  Wong was officially married twice, but had three notable relationships. He had three children with his first wife, singer Wah Wa. Their sons were Wong Yue-hon (ÈªÑÂÆáÁÄö) and Wong Yue-man (ÈªÑÂÆáÊñá). Their marriage ended while Hua Wa was pregnant with their only daughter, Ursule Wong (ÈªÑÂÆáËØó). Wong once said the most important love of his life was Eunice Lam, a writer whom he lived with from 1976 to 1990, but did not marry. Lam was also a radio host, and was the sister of Richard Lam, a Cantopop lyricist. Lam died from cancer in 2018. Wong's second marriage was to his long-time assistant, Winnie Chan, until his death, but she was never seen with him in public.

1963)\\"Makonnen Endelkachew\\", in Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia, David H. Shinn and Thomas P. Ofcansky, eds. (Scarecrow Press, 2004) pp265-266 was an Ethiopian aristocrat and Prime Minister under Emperor Haile Selassie. Mekonnen was born in Addisge, the nephew of the noted Shewan general and politician Ras Betwoded Tessema Nadew, who introduced him to Emperor Menilek II. He was a member of the alpha class of the Menelik II School in Addis Ababa when it opened in 1908.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 78 John Spencer describes Mekonnen as \\"a mountain of a man, weighing nearly 300 pounds, and with a high-pitched voice.\\" Despite this unimpressive appearance, Spencer notes \\"he was a particularly affable, indeed, gentle and kindly man, not given to the acerbities associated with sharp intelligence.\\" He was a published author, having written a novel, and a booklet on the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and Fascist atrocities.Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 161  Life  He was married twice. His second marriage, to the Emperor's niece, Princess Yeshashework Yilma, followed Makonnen's affair with the woman, who was married to the Tigrayan noble Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie at time. The affair threatened to destroy the accord Emperor Haile Selassie had carefully crafted, and led to Makonnen's recall from his post as Minister to Great Britain in 1932. Princess Yeshashwork was married to Bitwoded Makonnen Demissew after the death of her first husband, and would not marry Makonnen Endalkachew until after she was widowed for a second time during the Italian occupation, and her return from exile in 1941. Makonnen accompanied Haile Selassie during his tour of Europe from 16 April to 4 September 1924. Following his recall from London, he served as Minister of the Interior, then governor of Illubabor Province; while governor, he led the troops of that province against the Italian invasion on the Ogaden front, afterwards going into exile from 1936 to 1941 in Jerusalem, and accompanying the Emperor back into Ethiopia upon the liberation of the country. Emperor Haile Selassie appointed him Minister of the Interior in March 1941, as part of the cabinet Haile Selassie established to re-assert Ethiopia's existence as an independent state against the views of the British War Office that, since Ethiopia had previously been Italian territory, the Emperor \\"cannot fully reassume his status and powers as Emperor until a peace treaty has been signed with Italy\\". However, as John Spencer points out, Ethiopia was able to rely on the principle of postliminium‚Äîthat is, once enemy occupation is terminated, a state may act as if its existence had survived without interruption. \\"Having withdrawn its recognition of the Italian conquest,\\" Spencer points out, \\"Britain was in no position to contest Ethiopia's application of the doctrine of postliminium.\\"Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, p. 96 The conflict between Ethiopia and the United Kingdom over the former's sovereignty dominated their relations for the next several years. From 29 January 1943, when the Emperor created the position, Makonnen served as Ethiopia's first Prime Minister, until his retirement on 1 November 1957. Bahre Zewde notes, however, that Makonnen \\"was a mere ceremonial figure, given more to intellectual pursuits than to political machinations. The de facto prime minister [during Makonnen's tenure] was Tsahafe T'ezaz Walda-Giyorgis Walda-Yohannes.\\"Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 204. Spencer notes that his fellow ministers considered him \\"as a lightweight.\\" Although Makonnen led the delegation that represented Ethiopia at the summit in San Francisco that created the United Nations, because he was not fluent in either French or English he took no part in the debates.

Endelkachew Makonnen was a member of the aristocratic Addisge clan that were very influential in the later part of the Ethiopian monarchy. He would be the last Imperial Prime Minister appointed by Emperor Haile Selassie. He was a stepson of Princess Yeshashework Yilma, Emperor Haile Selassie's only niece.  Prime minister  The Oxford-educated Endelkachew served as Prime Minister from February 28 to July 22, 1974. During this period, the Imperial government was under assault by protesting students and striking workers who demanded investigation of corruption in the highest levels of government, reforms in land tenure, and political reforms as well. Endalkachew Makonnen attempted to address these demands by presenting reforms that began to change the very nature of the Ethiopian monarchy. The Emperor also agreed to some of these proposals, which included the drafting of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1955, and having the Prime Minister be responsible to the elected Lower House of Parliament rather than to the Emperor. \\"If this latter measure were to go into effect, it would result in a real diminution in the power and authority of the Crown\\", remarks Edmund J. Keller.Edmund J. Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1988), p. 176. All of these actions were made to restore order and help reestablish the legitimacy of the regime in the eyes of the general population. However, as Keller notes, this would have been difficult even in the best of times. Although he had support amongst the older, well-connected members of the military, younger radical elements in the armed forces began to work against him from the moment he took office. Some believe this was Endelkachew's motivation for seeking alliances with moderate military officers with bases of support, such as Alem Zewde Tessema, the commander of the paratrooper battalion, and who became chair of the Armed Forces Coordinated Committee (AFCC) on 23 March.According to John Spencer, Alem Zewde was his cousin, thus presumably inclined to support Endelkachew. (Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 337) Two days later, Alem Zewde ordered the arrest of 30 radical airmen at the Ethiopian Air Force base at Debre Zeyit. On 30 April Endelkachew moved to placate his opponents on the left by authorizing the arrest of the former ministers‚Äîand his former colleagues‚Äîin the Aklilu government for corruption. Despite these efforts, radicalism grew unchecked both in civil society and in the military. Alem Zewde was tainted due to his support for Endelkachew and on 22 June lost control of his own battalion, and fled to Gojjam seeking refuge.Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia, pp. 182f That same month, 12 or 16 members of the AFCC under the leadership of Colonel Atnafu Abate left that body and called for a meeting of representatives from all of the military units in Ethiopia at the headquarters of the Fourth Division, which was convened 28 June. This new committee became what was to be known as the Derg. Arrest The critical event that doomed Endelkachew's administration occurred on 26 June 1974. On that day, a group of conservative members from the Chamber of Deputies petitioned the Emperor for the release of some of the officials that had been imprisoned for corruption. Numerous writers agree with Keller's judgement that this act \\"was seen as a clear indication that ruling politicians had no intention of bringing these individuals to justice\\". The new military committee acted swiftly, arresting 50 more alleged culprits from the ruling classes on 30 June. Within the next two weeks 150 more members of the former government, the current government, the provincial administration, the nobility, and the Imperial family (Iskinder Desta, the Emperor's grandson) were arrested.Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia, pp. 183f Despite continued attempts to retain power, on 22 July, Prime Minister Endalkachew was arrested, and the Derg asked Lij Mikael Imru to assume the Prime Minister's office. Over the following months the Derg systematically dismantled the government and numerous public institutions. On 12 September, Emperor Haile Selassie was formally deposed by the Derg, an act Keller describes as \\"anticlimactic given the events that had unfolded since July\\".Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia, p. 184 At last, on November 23, Lij Endelkachew and 60 ex-officials of the former Emperor's government were taken from Menelik Palace and to Alem Bekagn prison where they were summarily executed.Marina and David Ottaway, Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 61 Previous posts Lij Endelkachew had previously served in a variety of diplomatic and political posts.

Biography  Taniguchi is the son of architect Yoshir≈ç Taniguchi (1904‚Äì1979). He studied engineering at Keio University, graduating in 1960, and studied architecture at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, graduating in 1964. He worked briefly for architect Walter Gropius, who became an important influence. From 1964 to 1972, Taniguchi worked for the studio of architect Kenzo Tange, who was perhaps the most important Japanese modernist architect, at Tokyo University. While in the Tange office, Taniguchi also worked on projects in Skopje, Yugoslavia and San Francisco, California (Yerba Buena), living on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley while involved in the latter project. Important later collaborators include Isamu Noguchi, American landscape architect Peter Walker, and artist Genichiro Inokuma. Taniguchi is best known for designing a number of Japanese museums, including the Nagano Prefectural Museum, the Marugame Genichiro Inokuma Museum of Contemporary Art, the Toyota Municipal Museum of Art, the D.T. Suzuki Museum (Èà¥Êú®Â§ßÊãôÈ§®, Suzuki Daisetsu Kan) in Kanazawa, and the Gallery of the H≈çry≈´-ji Treasures at the Tokyo National Museum. Taniguchi won a competition in 1997 to redesign the Museum of Modern Art, beating out nine other internationally renowned architects, including Rem Koolhaas, Bernard Tschumi, and Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/7517/releases/MOMA_1997_0030_26.pdf?2010 The MoMA commission was Taniguchi's first work outside Japan. Taniguchi designed the Texas Asia Society Center in Houston.

While lead designer for the Herman Miller furniture company, Nelson and his design studio, George Nelson Associates, designed 20th-century modernist furniture. He is considered a founder of American modernist design. 1908‚Äì1934: Early life Nelson was born on May 29, 1908 in Hartford, Connecticut to Simeon Nelson and Lillian Canterow Nelson. His parents owned a drugstore. He graduated from Hartford Public High School in 1924, and thereafter attended Yale University. He did not originally set out to become an architect; he happened upon the architecture school at Yale, when he ducked into a building during a rainstorm, in order to get out of the rain. Walking through the building, he came upon an exhibit of students' works entitled \\"A Cemetery Gateway\\". Nelson met with some early recognition while still an undergraduate, when he was published in Pencil Points and Architecture magazines. During his final year at Yale, he was hired by the architecture firm Adams and Prentice as a drafter. In 1928, he graduated with a degree in architecture. In 1929, Nelson was hired as a Teacher's Assistant while pursuing his second bachelor's degree at Yale. He received a degree in Fine Arts in 1931. The next year, while preparing for the Paris Prize competition, he won the Rome Prize, a fellowship that allowed him to study architecture in Rome for two years with a healthy stipend and accommodations in a palace. While based in Rome, Nelson traveled through Europe where he met a number of the modernist pioneers, whom he interviewed for articles for Pencil Points magazine. While being interviewed by Nelson, Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe asked about Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Nelson was embarrassed to say he did not know much about. Years later, however, Nelson would work with Wright on a special issue of Architectural Forum which catalyzed Wright's comeback from relative obscurity. While in Rome Nelson married Frances Hollister. A few years later, he returned to the United States to devote himself to writing. Through his articles in Pencil Points he introduced the work of Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, and Gio Ponti to North America. 1935‚Äì1944: Design writing In 1935, Nelson joined Architectural Forum, where he was first associate editor (1935‚Äì1943), and later consulting editor (1944‚Äì1949). There, he defended the modernist principles, arguing against colleagues who, as \\"industrial designers\\", made too many concessions to the commercial forces of the industry. Nelson believed the work of a designer should be to better the world. In his view, nature was already perfect, but man ruined it by making things that didn't follow the rules of nature. \\"The contemporary architect, cut off from symbols, ornament and meaningful elaborations of structural form, all of which earlier periods processed in abundance, has desperately chased every functional requirement, every change in sight or ornamentation, every technical improvement, to provide some basis for starting his work. Where the limitations were most rigorous, as for example in a factory, or in a skyscraper where every inch had to yield its profit, there the designers were happiest and the results most satisfying but; let a religious belief or a social ideal replace the cubic foot costs or radiation losses, and nothing happened. There is not a single modern church in the entire country that is comparable to a first-rate cafeteria, as far as solving the problem is concerned.\\" At this point, Nelson‚Äôs career still mainly involved writing for architecture magazines and not actually designing the solutions to modern living that he would later become famous for. During this period George Nelson spent a great deal of time interviewing and exchanging ideas with the other founders of the modernist architecture movement of the 1940s, including Eliot Noyes, Charles Eames, and Walter B. Ford, all of whom he would later collaborate with. By 1940, Nelson had become known for several innovative concepts. In his post-war book Tomorrow's House, co-authored with Henry Wright, he introduced the concept of the \\"family room\\", and the \\"storage wall\\". The storage wall was essentially the idea of recessed, built-in bookcases or shelving occupying space previously lost between walls. It was an idea developed while writing the book, when Nelson's publisher was pressuring him to finish the section on storage. Neither Wright nor Nelson could find any additional innovations when Nelson posed the question, \\"What's inside the wall?\\", It was then that the idea of utilizing the space between walls for storage was born. Tomorrow's House was innovative because it didn't look at modern design as a case of styles, but instead looked at the way problems needed to be solved. The book was a commercial success and made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. 1945‚Äì1954: Herman Miller The bubble lamp, one of Nelson's designs. In 1945, the Herman Miller furniture company was producing mostly conventional, wood-based designs. After reading Tomorrow's House D.J. Depree, the Chairman of Herman Miller, selected Nelson to be the company's next Director of Design, despite Nelson having no experience designing furniture. Depree was more interested in Nelson's insight into the best way to make furniture innovative and useful. Nelson was offered a contract that allowed him the freedom to work outside of Herman Miller, and to use designs from other architects that Nelson had worked with. He became the Director of Design for Herman Miller in 1947, and held the position until 1972. The first Herman Miller catalog produced by Nelson was released in 1945. Over the following years it would include some of the most iconic home furnishings of the 20th century. Ray and Charles Eames, Harry Bertoia, Richard Schultz, Donald Knorr, and Isamu Noguchi all worked for Herman Miller, under Nelson's supervision. Although both Bertoia and Noguchi later expressed regrets about their involvement, it became a successful period for the company, and for George Nelson. 1955‚Äì1980s: George Nelson Associates, Inc. Using the money he earned as Director of Design for Herman Miller, in 1947 Nelson opened a design studio in New York City. On October 26, 1955 he incorporated it into George Nelson Associates, Inc., and moved to 251 Park Avenue South. The studio was successful in bringing together many of the top designers of the era, who were soon designing for Herman Miller under the George Nelson label. Among the noted designers who worked for George Nelson Associates, Inc. were Irving Harper, George Mulhauser (designer of the Coconut Chair), Robert Brownjohn (designer of the sets for the James Bond film Goldfinger), Don Chadwick, Bill Renwick, Suzanne Sekey, John Svezia, Ernest Farmer, Tobias O'Mara, Ronald Beckman (designer of the Sling Sofa), George Tscherny, (who designed the Herman Miller advertisements), Lance Wyman, and John Pile. With his studio, Nelson enacted new practices for the involvement of design in all aspects of the company, pioneering the practice of corporate image management, graphic programs, and signage. By the time the company closed in the mid-1980s George Nelson Associates, Inc. had worked with most of the Fortune 500 companies. George Nelson's architectural projects included what he dubbed \\"The Colombian Garden of Health\\", a 200-bed tertiary care hospital in Bogota, Colombia, commisoned by the Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota. In 1959, he remarried to Jacqueline Griffiths. That same year, he served as the lead designer for the American National Exhibition in Moscow. =The office cubicle= In 1960 Herman Miller created the Herman Miller Research Corporation under the direction of Robert Propst, and the supervision of George Nelson. Although Nelson remained at Herman Miller's main campus in Zeeland, Michigan, Robert Propst and the Herman Miller Research Corporation was located in Ann Arbor, Michigan to place it in close proximity to the University of Michigan campus. The company's purpose was to examine changes in the use of office furniture that had taken place during the 20th century, but not the furniture itself. After consulting with experts in psychology, anthropology, and various other fields, Propst created the Action Office I line, which was executed by Nelson's studio, and first appeared in Herman Miller's 1964 catalog. For designing the Action Office I Nelson was awarded the prestigious Alcoa award. The Action Office I line was not a success, and Nelson was removed from the project. Propst then created the Action Office II, which is better known today as the office cubicle. Despite the \\"Action Office II\\" line becoming Herman Miller's most successful project, George Nelson disowned himself from any connection with the project. In 1970 he sent a letter to Robert Blaich, who had become Herman Miller's Vice-President for Corporate Design and Communication, in which he described the system's \\"dehumanizing effect as a working environment.\\" He summed up his feeling by saying: > \\"One does not have to be an especially perceptive critic to realize that AO > II is definitely not a system which produces an environment gratifying for > people in general. But it is admirable for planners looking for ways of > cramming in a maximum number of bodies, for \\"employees\\" (as against > individuals), for \\"personnel,\\" corporate zombies, the walking dead, the > silent majority. A large market.\\" Scornful as he may have been, Nelson was right that there turned out to be a \\"larger market\\" for AO II. By 2005 total sales had reached $5 billion. 1980s: Retirement and death Nelson retired with the closing of his studio in the mid-1980s. In 1984, he became a scholar in residence at the Cooper- Hewitt Museum. He died in New York City in 1986. Influence and legacy The George Nelson Associates, Inc. catalog, and exhibition designs for Herman Miller, made modernism the most important driving force in the company. From his start in the mid-forties until the mid-eighties George Nelson Associates, Inc. partnered with most of the modernist designers of the time. This was both the result of Nelson's time as a magazine editor, and because of Nelson's writing. His skill as a writer helped legitimize and stimulate the field of industrial design by contributing to the creation of Industrial Design magazine in 1953. Nelson wrote extensively, published several books, and organized conferences like the Aspen design gatherings, where for more than 30 years he was the guiding force. In 1971, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for his project \\"Hidden Cities\\". One of George Nelson's areas of interest was the reduction of pollution. Through his attempts to reduce all forms of pollution, including visual, audio, and chemical, Nelson pioneered the idea of the outdoor shopping mall, first using the idea in a proposal for the city plan of Austin, Texas, which was not used. In 2008, the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, held a retrospective of Nelson's work to celebrate his 100th birthday. Design critic Alice Rawsthorn, covering the retrospective for The New York Times, argued that Nelson's contributions have been unfairly overlooked due to his association with the cubicle and jokey 1950s objects. \\"Blaming Nelson for the soullessness of today's open-plan offices seems as unfair as slating Le Corbusier for other architects' sloppily designed skyscrapers, or Marcel Duchamp for every lazy piece of conceptual art,\\" she wrote. \\"[Nelson] championed the importance of values in design, which he saw as a catalyst for social change.\\" =Attribution= In recent years it has become known that many of the designs George Nelson accepted credit for were actually the work of other designers employed at his studios. Examples of this include the Marshmallow sofa, which was actually designed by Irving Harper, and the Action Office, for which Nelson won the prestigious Alcoa Award, neglecting to mention that it was largely designed by Robert Propst. John Pile, a designer who worked for Nelson in the 1950s, commented about this practice; \\"George's attitude was that it was okay for individual designers to be given credit in trade publications, but for the consumer world, the credit should always be to the firm, not the individual. He didn't always follow through on that policy though.\\"http://www.georgenelson.org/biographymore.html In an interview in Metropolis in 2001, Irving Harper also commented on this practice: \\"...there always had to be one name associated with the work. We couldn't just spread it around‚Ä¶ that's fine. I'm grateful to George for what he did for me. While he was alive, I made no demands whatsoever, but now that he's gone, whenever the Marshmallow Sofa is referred to as a 'George Nelson design', it sort of gets to me. I don't go out of my way to set things right, but if anybody asks me who designed it, I'm perfectly happy to tell them.\\"Mid-Century Online Magazine, George Nelson, May 25, 2012  Furniture designs  \\"Coconut\\" Chair, 1958 Brooklyn Museum \\"Ball\\" Wall Clock, 1948-1969 Brooklyn Museum (# indicates designs currently available from Herman Miller) * 1946 Slat Bench a/k/a Platform Bench # * 1946 Basic Cabinet Series # (a number of these cabinets were reintroduced by Herman Miller in 2011) * 1946 Sofas, chairs, settees, and bedroom pieces (all included in the first Herman Miller catalog) * 1947 Bubble Lamp # (previously available from Howard Miller Clock company, then Modernica, but now available as of 2016 from Herman Miller) * 1950 Ball clock # (likely designed by Irving Harper, originally made by Howard Miller, reintroduced by Vitra) * 1952 Rosewood Group * 1952 Executive Office Group * 1954 Miniature Cases # * 1954 Steel-frame Group * 1954 Nelson End Table (and low coffee table) # * 1955 Flying Duck Chair * 1955 Coconut Chair # (currently available in black leather only, but without the matching ottoman) * 1956 Thin Edge Cases # (a number of these cabinets were reintroduced by Herman Miller in 2012) * 1956 Kangaroo Chair * 1958 Swagged-Leg (a/k/a/ Swag Leg) Group # (reintroduced by Herman Miller in 2011) * 1959 Comprehensive Storage System (CSS) * 1963 Catenary Group * 1964 Action Office I (principally designed by Robert Propst) * 1964 Sling Sofa & coffee table His firm, George Nelson Associates, also designed a large series of wall and table clocks for the Howard Miller company, as well as a range of hanging Bubble Lamps, which had plastic membrane-covered wire-form shades, wrought iron fireplace pieces, planters, room dividers, ceiling-mounted \\"Ribbon Wall,\\" spice cabinets, and many other products that became milestones in the history of a profession that he helped to shape. A number of the nearly 300 classic wall and table clocks for Howard Miller Clock Company (including the Ball, Kite, Eye, Turbine, Spindle, Petal and Spike clocks, as well as a handful of desk clocks) are currently available from Vitra. Many were designed by Irving Harper (as well as Lucia Derespinis, Charles Pollock, and others). Subsequently, Vitra has discontinued some of their reproduction clocks based on sales. All the original clock designs were simply assigned numbers by Howard Miller. Probably the most recognisable of the series, the Ball Clock, was advertised and sold as ‚ÄòClock 4755‚Äô; the Sunflower Clock as ‚ÄòClock 2261‚Äô. Several colour variations were available for many of the clocks. The Ball Clock was available in six colour variations, the Sunflower Clock in three. One of the more unusual designs, the Eye Clock (‚ÄòClock 2238‚Äô) was pictured in the original Howard Miller Clock Company brochures in a diagonal position, not horizontal, as would be expected.Mid-Century Online Magazine, George Nelson and the Howard Miller Clock Company, November 7, 2012 Analysis of work = Metadesign = It has been argued that Nelson might be called a metadesigner - that his intent of study and practice was neither the building nor the product but rather the process of design itself. Nelson's manner of interdisciplinary design, and therefore progressive thinking, reoriented the entire concern with capitalist destruction around the dynamic of producer and product. However, when comparing the careers of other designers, he seemed not only unconventional and tastefully noncommercial, but at times negative. \\"...it is the career of an architect who advocated the end of architecture, a furniture designer who imagined rooms without furniture, an urban designer who contemplated the hidden city, an industrial designer who questioned the future of the object and hated the obsession with products.\\" =Fairchild House= New York, New York. US 1941-The Fairchild House was built for the Airplane manufacturer Sherman Fairchild and was meant to be a \\"machine for living\\". What made the Fairchild House different from every other Brown Stone in New York was its views. There was a courtyard in the middle of the building and all the windows faced in toward it. This made the home feel more tranquil and the view provided use for Nelson's signature floor to ceiling windows. Much of the house is designed in style not necessarily common in early modern design. This is evidence of Nelson's philosophy that \\"good design is timeless.\\"Ferhman, Kennith, Cherie Ferhman, Post War Interior Design. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., 1987. =Sling Sofa= Herman Miller 1963- This sofa is made of leather and filled with solid foam cushions. The joints are all held with epoxy so that it can be more easily mass-produced and sold for a cheaper price. There is no need for hand crafting with this sofa.Meadmore, Clement. The Modern Chair: Classics in Production. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1979. Because of its perfect proportions and light appearance it doesn't look like it's just an elongated chair. Nelson's use of a single welt along the perimeter of the padding gives the seating an approachable softness and yet, there is more going on that cannot be seen. The padding is held up by rubber bands that allow for more comfort and the use of epoxy for the joints gives the shape a much smoother feel. It is a modern design only because it was made recently. Like most of Nelson's work it was only designed to be as useful and comfortable as possible. A rare coffee table was also designed.

It is located to the north-west of Melton Mowbray. It was originally known as \\"Wold Dalby\\" or \\"Dalby on the Wolds\\". The population is included in the civil parish of Broughton and Old Dalby which includes the settlement of Queensway.

It has its own primary and pre-schools, Church, Scout, Cubs and Beaver Building at Queensway, and a retirement home, Hunter's Lodge.Hunters Lodge retirement home There are two pub/restaurants, the Belvoir Brewery restaurant and alehouse,Brewery and, from August 2015 after a closure lasting over a year, the ancient but refurbished pub 'The Crown'. There has been no post office for several years but Sunday newspapers are sold from the Village Hall and there is a \\"pop-up\\" post office service. Campaign For around 33 years, on the August bank holiday Monday, the village held a f√™te known as \\"Old Dalby Day\\" to raise money for charities connected with the village. The f√™te grew to feature many events and attracted visitors from many miles around. In 2019 insufficient volunteers were prepared to help organise the event and Old Dalby Day was suspended. In 2019 the prominent Turkey oak that stood at the village green was found to be diseased; it has been pollarded rather than felled outright. The Knights Hospitallers owned a preceptory in the village from the early 12th century. Traces of the historically important Dalby Preceptory are still just visible on the surface. The ancient carp ponds survive to this day. Before and early in the Second World War an Ordnance Depot was established to the east of the village serving as a storage depot for machinery, associated spares and tools. The depot closed in 1996 and now serves as Old Dalby Business Park. The camp that grew nearby to house the workers and military personnel for the depot was originally a series of Nissen huts housing nearly 3,500 soldiers and around 300 prisoners of war. These later became derelict and a housing estate developed there which is now a separate settlement known as Queensway. Village hall The village hall is located at the centre of the village and was originally a school house. is the meeting place of several local societies, including the, Wine Club, yoga classes, the crafters and a \\"drop in\\" mornings. Other entertainment and events take place throughout the year. In 2018/9 the Hall was awarded a grant towards its refurbishment by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Events designed to further knowledge of the village's heritage and history have included a Feast Day with a visit from Tony Rotherham, a lecture on archaeology by Carenza Lewis and lessons in Edwardian dress and manners for children from the local school. In September 2019 several test mini pits were excavated throughout the village under the supervision of Carenza Lewis. Amongst the finds were an array of clay pipes, 8th century earthernware and, from near the long gone Queensway Camp guardhouse, a soldier's cap badge. The heritage group has, with the advice and help of The Heritage Lottery Fund and Lincoln University, created an Archive to collate, record, digitise and archive a series of historical photographs and documents submitted by long term residents. This initiative is in progress and can be accessed via the Village Hall website. During lockdown, in 2020, many of the activities have been suspended but the village hall committee have worked hard to design and produce a display of the history of Old Dalby. This will take the form of a 3 metre long wall chart to be hung inside the hall, due to be revealed in October 2020. Queensway Queensway, part of Old Dalby, is a small housing estate of less than 200 homes around a mile to the east of the village. Green fields until 1938 the land was bought by the War Office and a camp established to serve the ordinance and maintenance depot that was built nearby at the outbreak of WW2. At the height of its use the camp housed some 3,500 army and civilian personnel, mainly in Nissan huts. The camp also guarded around 300 prisoners of war. Gradually houses were built, from the early 50‚Äôs and throughout the 60‚Äôs, as homes for permanent officers and staff. The road ‚ÄúQueensway‚Äù was named for the Queen on her coronation in June 1953 and the entire settlement shortly thereafter adopted the name. The camp, and depot, had its own cinema, canteen/ restaurants, officers mess, dance hall and sports pitches. After the war ended and the need for staff diminished houses were sold and the army presence gradually reduced. The depot remained busy, however, repairing large weapons, their transport and equipment. A fence remained around the base for many years and the gates were actually locked and guarded for a while after IRA attacks on mainland Britain in the 1980‚Äôs. The depot continued in use throughout the cold war and became a centre of excellence for maintenance of electronic and radar equipment. Finally closing as a military base in the 1990‚Äôs the buildings became industrial units and remain as such. One of the buildings was taken by Belvoir Brewery who produce a wide range of ales and have their own alehouse and restaurant. Railway test track Old Dalby Test Track in April 2015 Old Dalby is the location of the control centre of the former British Rail Research Division's railway Old Dalby Test Track, which runs between Melton Mowbray and Edwalton. It was established in 1970 to test the Advanced Passenger Train.APT enters three-year development phase Railway Gazette International December 1970 page 828 In July 1984 the track was used to run a Class 46 locomotive and train into a stationary nuclear flask in order to prove the safety of the container. The test was recorded and reported widely enough to make Old Dalby famous for a while. A video of the test can be seen here.

He was the father of Donald Trump, the 45th and incumbent president of the United States. In partnership with his mother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, Fred began a career in home construction and sales. Their real estate development company was incorporated as \\"E. Trump & Son\\" in 1927 (later called the Fred Trump Organization). It grew to build and manage single-family houses in Queens, barracks and garden apartments for U.S. Navy personnel near major shipyards along the East Coast, and more than 27,000 apartments in New York City. Trump was investigated by a U.S. Senate committee for profiteering in 1954, and again by the State of New York in 1966. Donald became the president of his father's real estate business in 1971, and they were sued by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division for violating the Fair Housing Act in 1973. In later years, Fred conducted fraudulent schemes to benefit Donald, and suffered from Alzheimer's disease. In 1997, when his worth exceeded a billion dollars, he transferred the majority of his buildings to his surviving children, who sold them in 2004 for over 16 times their previously declared worth, effectively dodging hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Early life and career Trump's father, the German American Frederick Trump, amassed considerable wealth during the Klondike Gold Rush by running a restaurant for the miners. Frederick Sr. returned to Kallstadt in 1901, and by the next year, met and married Elizabeth Christ. They moved to New York City, where their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1904. Later that year, the family returned to Kallstadt. Fred was conceived in Bavaria, where his parents wished to residency, but Frederick Sr. was banished for dodging the draft. The family returned to New York on July 1, 1905, and moved to the Bronx, where Frederick Christ Trump was born on October 11. Fred Trump's younger brother, John G. Trump, was born in 1907. All three children were raised speaking German. In September 1908, the family moved to Woodhaven, Queens. At the age of 10, Fred worked as a delivery boy for a butcher. About two years later, his father died in the 1918 flu pandemic. From 1918 to 1923, Fred attended Richmond Hill High School in Queens, while working as a caddy, curb whitewasher, and delivery boy. Meanwhile, his mother continued the real estate business Frederick had begun. Interested in becoming a builder, Fred took night classes in carpentry and reading blueprints. He also studied plumbing, masonry, and electrical wiring via correspondence courses. After graduating in January 1923, Trump obtained full-time work pulling lumber to construction sites. He found work as a carpenter's assistant and continued his education at Pratt Institute. Trump's mother loaned him $800 to build his first house construction project, which he completed in 1924. Elizabeth Trump held the business in her name because Fred had not reached the age of majority. \\"E. Trump & Son\\" was established in 1925 and did business as early as 1926. That year, Trump built 20 homes in Queens, selling some houses before they were complete to finance others. The company was incorporated in 1927. =1927 arrest= Ku Klux Klan members being confronted by police in Queens on Memorial Day 1927 On Memorial Day in 1927, over a thousand Ku Klux Klan members marched in a Queens parade to protest \\"Native-born Protestant Americans\\" being \\"assaulted by Roman Catholic police of New York City.\\" The 21-year old Trump and six other men were arrested. All seven were referred to as \\"berobed marchers\\" in the Long Island Daily Press; Trump, detained \\"on a charge of refusing to disperse from a parade when ordered to do so,\\" was dismissed. Another of the men, arrested on the same charge, was a bystander who had had his foot run over by a police car. According to the police, the five remaining men were certainly Klan members. Multiple newspaper articles on the incident list Trump's address (in Jamaica, Queens), which he is recorded as sharing with his mother in the 1930 census and a 1936 wedding announcement. In September 2015, Boing Boing reproduced the article, and Fred's son Donald Trump, then a candidate for president of the United States, told The New York Times, \\"that's where my grandmother lived and my father, early on.\\" Then, when asked about the 1927 story, he denied that his father had ever lived at that address, and said the arrest \\"never happened,\\" and, \\"There was nobody charged.\\" =Rise to success= In 1933 Trump built one of New York City's first modern supermarkets, called Trump Market, in Woodhaven, Queens. It was modeled on Long Island's King Kullen, a self-service supermarket chain. Trump's store advertised \\"Serve Yourself and Save!\\" and quickly became popular. After six months, Trump sold it to King Kullen. In 1934, Trump and a partner acquired in federal court the mortgage-servicing subsidiary of Brooklyn's J. Lehrenkrauss Corporation, which had gone bankrupt and subsequently been broken up. This gave Trump access to the titles of many properties nearing foreclosure, which he bought at low cost and sold at a profit. This and similar real estate ventures quickly thrust him into the limelight as one of New York City's most successful businessmen. Trump made use of loan subsidies created by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) not long after the program was initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934. By 1936, Trump had 400 workers digging foundations for houses that would be sold at prices ranging from $3,000 to $6,250. Trump used his father's tactic of listing properties at prices like $3,999.99. In the late 1930s, he used a yacht called the Trump Show Boat to advertise his business off the shore of Coney Island. It played patriotic music and floated out swordfish-shaped balloons which could be redeemed for $25 or $250 towards one of his properties. In 1938, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle referred to Trump as the \\"Henry Ford of the home-building industry.\\" Personal life Trump c. 1941 Trump met his future wife Mary Anne MacLeod, an immigrant from Tong, Lewis, Scotland, at a dance party in the early to mid-1930s. Trump told his mother the same evening that he had met his future wife. Trump, a Lutheran, married Mary, a Presbyterian, on January 11, 1936, at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church with George Arthur Buttrick officiating. A wedding reception was held at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, and they had a single-night honeymoon in Atlantic City. The couple settled in Jamaica, Queens, and had five children: Maryanne Trump Barry (born 1937; a federal judge until her retirement), Fred Trump Jr. (1938‚Äì1981), Elizabeth Trump Grau (born 1942), Donald Trump (born 1946; the 45th president of the United States) and Robert Trump (1948‚Äì2020; a top executive of his father's property management company until his retirement). Trump was a teetotaler and an authoritarian parent, maintaining curfews and forbidding cursing, lipstick, and snacking between meals. At the end of his day, Trump would receive a report from Mary on the children's actions and, if necessary, decide upon disciplinary actions. He took his children to building sites to collect empty bottles to return for the deposits. The boys had paper routes, and when weather conditions were poor, their father would let them make their deliveries in a limousine. According to Fred Jr.'s daughter, Mary L. Trump, Trump wanted his oldest son to be \\"invulnerable\\" in personality so he could take over the family business, but Fred Jr. was the opposite. Trump instead elevated Donald to become his business heir, teaching him to \\"be a killer,\\" and telling him, \\"You are a king.\\" Mary L. Trump states that Fred Sr. \\"dismantled [Fred Jr.] by devaluing and degrading every aspect of his personality\\" and mocked him for his decision to become an airline pilot. In 1981, Fred Jr. died at age 42 from complications due to his alcoholism. After Elizabeth's birth, and with America becoming more involved in World War II, Trump moved his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia. In 1944, as Trump's FHA funding lulled, they returned to Jamaica Estates, Queens, where Mary suffered a miscarriage. By 1946, they were living in a five-bedroom Tudor-style house Trump built in Jamaica Estates, and Trump purchased a neighboring half-acre lot, where he built a 23-room, 9-bathroom home. The family moved in in 1951, and Fred and Mary remained there until their deaths. The couple was also given an apartment on the 63rd (in reality the 55th) floor of their son Donald's Trump Tower (), which they rarely used. During the war and until the 1980s, Trump denied that he spoke German and claimed that he was of Swedish origin. According to Trump's nephew, John Walter, \\"He had a lot of Jewish tenants and it wasn't a good thing to be German in those days.\\" In 1973, Trump claimed to have been born in New Jersey in an interview with The New York Times. Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal (1987) similarly states that Fred Trump was the son of an immigrant from Sweden and born in New Jersey. Trump's contributions to Jewish charities led some to believe that he belonged to the Jewish faith. During the 1980s, Fred Trump became friends with future Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, who at the time was the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations in Manhattan. Later career Trump c. 1950 During World War II, Trump built barracks and garden apartments for U.S. Navy personnel near major shipyards along the East Coast. After the war, he expanded into middle- income housing for the families of returning veterans. From 1947 to 1949, Trump built Shore Haven in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, which included 32 six-story buildings and a shopping center, covering some 30 acres, and procuring him $9 million in FHA funding. In 1950, he built the 23-building Beach Haven Apartments over 40 acres near Coney Island, procuring him $16 million in FHA funds. The total number of apartments included in these projects exceeded 2,700. In 1963‚Äì64, he built Trump Village, an apartment complex in Coney Island, for $70 million‚Äîone of his biggest and last major projects. He built more than 27,000 low-income apartments and row houses in the New York area altogether. =Profiteering investigations= In early 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and other federal leaders began denouncing real estate profiteers. On June 11, The New York Times included Trump on a list of 35 city builders accused of profiteering from government contracts. He and others were investigated by a U.S. Senate Banking committee for windfall gains. Trump and his partner William Tomasello were cited as examples of how profits were made by builders using the FHA. The two paid $34,200 for a piece of land which they rented to their corporation for $76,960 annually in a 99-year lease, so that if the apartment they built on it ever defaulted, the FHA would owe them $1.924 million. Trump and Tomasello evidently obtained loans for $3.5 million more than Beach Haven Apartments had cost. Trump argued that because he had not withdrawn the money, he had not literally pocketed the profits. He further argued that due to rising costs, he would have had to invest more than the 10% of the mortgage loan not provided by the FHA, and therefore suffer a loss if he built under those conditions. In 1966, Trump was again investigated for windfall profiteering, this time by New York's State Investigation Commission. After Trump overestimated building costs sponsored by a state program, he profited $598,000 on equipment rentals in the construction of Trump Village, which was then spent on other projects. Under testimony on January 27, 1966, Trump said that he had personally done nothing wrong and praised the success of his building project. The commission called Trump \\"a pretty shrewd character\\" with a \\"talent for getting every ounce of profit out of his housing project,\\" but no indictments were made. Instead, tighter administration protocols and accountability in the state's housing program were called for. =Son becomes company president= Fred's son Donald joined his father's real estate business around 1968, initially working in Brooklyn, and rising to become company president in 1971. He entered the real estate business in Manhattan, while his father stuck to Brooklyn and Queens. Donald later said, \\"It was good for me. You know, being the son of somebody, it could have been competition to me. This way, I got Manhattan all to myself.\\" He began calling the company the Trump Organization around 1973. In the mid-1970s, Donald received loans from his father exceeding $14 million. In 2015‚Äì16, during his campaign for U.S. president, Donald claimed that his father had given him \\"a small loan of a million dollars,\\" which he used to build \\"a company that's worth more than $10 billion,\\" denying that he had inherited $200 million from his father. An October 2018 New York Times expos√© on Fred and Donald Trump's finances concludes that Donald \\"was a millionaire by age 8,\\" and that he had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from Fred's business empire over his lifetime, including over $60 million ($140 million in 2018 currency) in loans, which were largely unreimbursed. =Civil rights suit= Minority applicants turned away from renting apartments complained to the New York City Commission on Human Rights and the Urban League, leading these groups to send test applicants to Trump-owned complexes in July 1972. They found that white people were offered apartments, while black people were generally turned away (by being told there were no vacancies); according to the superintendent of Beach Haven Apartments, this was at the direction of his boss. Both of the aforementioned advocacy organizations then raised the issue with the Justice Department. In October 1973, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil rights suit against the Trump Organization (Fred Trump, chair, and Donald Trump, president) for infringing the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In response, Trump attorney Roy Cohn countersued for $100 million in damages, accusing the DOJ of false accusations. Some three dozen former Trump employees were interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Some testified that they had no knowledge of any racial profiling practices, and that a small percentage of their apartments were rented to blacks or Puerto Ricans. A former doorman testified that his supervisor had instructed him to tell prospective black tenants that the rent was double its actual amount. Four landlords or rental agents confirmed that applications sent to the Trump organization's head office for approval were coded by the race of the applicant. One former employee testified that a code‚Äîwhich he believed was used throughout the Brooklyn branch of the company‚Äîreferred to \\"low lifes\\" such as \\"blacks, Puerto Ricans, apparent drug users, or any other type of undesirable applicant,\\" and nine times out of ten it meant the applicant was black; blacks were also falsely told there were no vacancies. A rental agent who had worked with the company for two weeks said that when he asked Fred Trump if he should rent to blacks, he was told that it was \\"absolutely against the law to discriminate,\\" but after asking again, he was instructed \\"not to rent to blacks,\\" and was further advised to: A consent decree between the DOJ and the Trump Organization was signed on June 10, 1975, with both sides claiming victory‚Äîthe Trump Organization for its perceived ability to continue denying rentals to welfare recipients, and the head of DOJ's housing division for the decree being \\"one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated.\\" It personally and corporately prohibited the Trumps from \\"discriminating against any person in the ... sale or rental of a dwelling,\\" and \\"required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers, promote minorities to professional jobs, and list vacancies on a preferential basis\\". Finally, it ordered the Trumps to \\"thoroughly acquaint themselves personally on a detailed basis with ... the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\\" = Later legal trespasses = In early 1976, Trump was ordered by a county judge to correct code violations in a 504-unit property in Seat Pleasant, Maryland. According to the county's housing department investigator, violations included broken windows, dilapidated gutters, and missing fire extinguishers. After a court date and a series of phone calls with Trump, he was invited to the property to meet with county officials in September 1976 and arrested on site. Trump was released on $1,000 bail. In 1987, when Donald's loan debt to his father exceeded $11 million, Fred invested $15.5 million in Trump Palace Condominiums and sold these shares to his son for $10,000, thus appearing to avoid millions of dollars of taxes on Donald's behalf by masking a hidden donation and benefiting from an illegal tax write-off. In late 1990, when an $18.4 million bond payment for Trump's Castle was due, Fred used a bookkeeper to purchase $3.5 million in casino chips, placing no bet, helping Donald avoid defaulting on his bonds; this action, illegal in New Jersey, resulted in a $65,000 fine.  Philanthropy  Trump (left) and other realtors at a New York and Brooklyn federation Jewish charity dinner in 1941 Fred and Mary Trump supported medical charities by donating buildings. After Mary received medical care at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, they donated the Trump Pavilion; Fred was also a trustee of the hospital. The couple donated a two-building complex in Brooklyn as a home for \\"functionally retarded adults\\" and other buildings to the National Kidney Foundation of New York and New Jersey. The Cerebral Palsy Foundation of New York and New Jersey also received a building. Fred reportedly also supported the Long Island Jewish Hospital and the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. The Trumps were active in The Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Lighthouse for the Blind. Fred supported the Kew-Forest School, where his children attended and he served on the board of directors. Trump backed both Jewish and Israeli causes, including Israel Bonds, donating the land for the Beach Haven Jewish Center in Flatbush, New York, and serving as the treasurer of an Israel benefit concert featuring American easy-listening performers. In 2018, The New York Times reported in an expos√© on Trump's financial records that they had found no evidence that he had made any significant financial contributions to charities.  Wealth and death  In 1976, Trump set up trust funds of $1 million ($ million in currency) for each of his five children and three grandchildren, which paid out yearly dividends. Trump appeared on the initial Forbes 400 list of richest Americans in 1982 with an estimated $200 million fortune split with his son Donald. (It was later revealed that Donald's share of the fortune was closer to $5 million, although he claimed both the family fortune and his share of it was much higher, even using a false identity to make such arguments in 1984.) In December 1990, Donald sought to amend his father's will, which according to Maryanne Trump Barry, \\"was basically taking the whole estate and giving it to Donald,\\" allowing him to \\"sell, do anything he wants ... with the properties.\\" The Washington Post wrote that this \\"was designed to protect Donald Trump‚Äôs inheritance from efforts to seize it by creditors and Ivana,\\" whom he divorced that month. Fred Trump rejected the proposal, and in 1991, composed his own final will, which made Donald, Maryanne, and Robert Trump co-executors of his estate. Trump's lawyer noted that Fred Jr.'s children, Fred III and Mary L. Trump, would be treated unequally because they would not receive their deceased father's share, and wrote to Trump that \\"Given the size of your estate, this is tantamount to disinheriting them. You may wish to increase their participation in your estate to avoid ill will in the future.\\" In October 1991, Trump was diagnosed with \\"mild senile dementia\\", displaying symptoms such as forgetfulness. Trump began to suffer from Alzheimer's disease around 1993, by which time the anticipated shares of Trump's estate amounted to $35 million for each surviving child. In 1997, Trump transferred ownership of most of his apartment buildings, valued at just $41.4 million, to his four surviving children. Trump finally fell ill with pneumonia in mid-1999. He was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, where he died at age 93 on June 25. His funeral was held at the Marble Collegiate Church, and was attended by over 600 people. His body is buried in a family plot at the Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens. Upon his death, Trump's estate was estimated by his family at $250 million to $300 million, though he had only $1.9 million in cash. His will divided over $20 million after taxes among his surviving children and grandchildren. His widow, Mary, died on August 7, 2000, in New Hyde Park, New York, at age 88. Her and Fred's combined estate was then valued at $51.8 million. Following Trump's death, Fred Jr.'s children contested his will, citing his dementia and claiming that the will was \\"procured by fraud and undue influence\\" by Donald, Maryanne, and Robert Trump. These three had claimed in their legal depositions that Fred Trump was \\"sharp as a tack\\" until just before his death, with Donald specifically denying any knowledge of his father's mental decline, including his 1991 dementia diagnosis. Barry later privately admitted she knew her father had dementia at the time. Mary L. Trump recounts that in later years her grandfather forgot people he had known for decades, including her, whom he referred to as \\"nice lady\\". In 2004, Trump's four surviving children sold the apartments they acquired in 1997 (then valued at $41.4 million) for $737.9 million ($705.6 million of which was to Rubin Schron), 16 times their previously declared worth. Hundreds of millions in gift taxes were effectively dodged by undervaluing the assets. In October 2018, The New York Times published an expos√© which shows that Fred and Mary provided their children with over $1 billion altogether, which should have been taxed at the rate of 55% for gifts and inheritances (over $550 million), but records show that a total of only $52.2 million (about 5%) was paid. Donald Trump's lawyer denied allegations of fraud and tax evasion, claiming that \\"President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters. The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon [licensed attorneys, Certified Public Accountants and real estate appraisers]\\". New York State could prosecute individuals on the basis of intentional tax evasion if a fraudulent return form can be produced as evidence; the statute of limitations does not apply in such cases. Legacy Singer Woody Guthrie was a tenant in one of Trump's apartment complexes in Brooklyn in 1950. In his unrecorded song \\"Old Man Trump,\\" he accused his landlord of stirring up racial hate \\"in the bloodpot of human hearts.\\" In 1993, Harry Hurt III wrote in his book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump that he overheard Fred Trump talking about Donald and his wife Marla Maples as they departed for a flight, saying, \\"I hope their plane crashes,\\" because then \\"all my problems will be solved.\\" According to publisher Simon & Schuster, Mary L. Trump, in her 2020 book, Too Much and Never Enough, recounts \\"the appalling way Donald, Fred Trump's favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer's.\\" In her book, Mary, a clinical psychologist, diagnoses Fred as a high-functioning sociopath. In October 2016, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the FBI released a small file it had on Trump. It includes a 1986 New York Daily News article on Trump Management's campaign donations of over $350,000 to New York mayor Ed Koch; the bureau was also possibly concerned about ties to organized crime, but much of the relevant information is redacted. By early 2017, the FBI had also declassified 389 pages from its 1970s investigation of alleged racial discrimination by Trump's company. Comedian Seth MacFarlane credits Donald Trump's fortune to his father, comparing their relationship to that of Jaden and Will Smith. Fred Willard played Trump's ghost on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and an animated Fred Trump appears in episodes of Our Cartoon President. An episode of the 2019 television series Watchmen titled \\"This Extraordinary Being\\" appears to depict him as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. A satirical piece in McSweeney's depicts someone who attempts to go back in time to kill Adolf Hitler, but arrives at the hospital room where Fred and Mary Trump are with their newborn baby Donald. Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis writes for The Daily Beast that Fred \\"was a study in cruelty and tyranny, producing a son [Donald] who, in order to get paternal approval, or even be noticed, had to be at least as cruel,\\" and that Donald \\"is still the kid at the dinner table trying to get daddy to like him best.\\" Notes References Citations =Sources=  Further reading External links * 1905 births 1999 deaths 20th-century American businesspeople American billionaires American carpenters American construction businesspeople American landlords American people of German descent American real estate businesspeople Anti-black racism in the United States Burials in New York (state) Businesspeople from New York City Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Deaths from pneumonia Fathers of Presidents of the United States People from Jamaica Estates, Queens People from the Bronx People from Woodhaven, Queens Philanthropists from New York (state) Pratt Institute alumni Fred ","title":"Fred Trump"},{"id":"1203318","text":"Command prompt of Windows XP showing volume serial number of drive C:.

Champollion was to provide for return of cometary samples to Earth. This part of the Rosetta mission was withdrawn in late 1996 due to lack of funding from JPL. Deep Space 4 / Space Technology 4 Champollion (original concept) Champollion was revived under NASA's New Millennium Program as Deep Space 4 / Space Technology 4, again as a joint project of NASA and CNES. In this version, Champollion would be a stand-alone project consisting of an orbiter and a lander, with the focus shifted somewhat to engineering validation of new technologies rather than pure science. As of March 1999, the baseline mission was to launch in April 2003, reaching comet Tempel 1 in 2006. The sample return element of the mission was at this point contingent on sufficient funding/resources, possibly being replaced with a demonstration of related capabilities. The lander was approximately 1.5m high weighing 160 kg; it was to autonomously navigate to the comet from 50 km altitude and anchor itself with a spike. The planned payload included: *CHARGE, a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer *CIRCLE, cameras/microscope/IR spectrometer *CIVA, panoramic cameras *CPPP, \\"physical properties probes\\" to be driven into the cometary surface *SATM drill mechanism *gamma ray/neutron spectrometer The orbiter was to carry cameras and a dust monitor.

In an elaborate procession, which has often reminded literate onlookers of the sixth chapter of 2 Samuel where King David leads the people dancing before the Ark,For example, Ullendorff, Ethiopia and the Bible, p. 83; Buxton, The Abyssinians, p. 32. the tabot is carried around the church courtyard on the patronal feast day, and also on the great Feast of Timket (known as Epiphany or Theophany in Europe).Donald N. Levine, Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture, (Chicago: University Press, 1972), p. 63. Buxton describes one such procession, on the festival of Gebre Menfes Qidus: : To the uninstructed onlooker the climax of the service came at the end, when the tabot or ark was brought out, wrapped in coloured cloths, carried on the head of a priest. As it appeared in the doorway the women raised the ilil, a prolonged and piercing cry of joy. When the tabot goes out of the Bete Meqdes ·â§·â∞ ·àò·âÖ·ã∞·àµ, everyone goes down to the floor and says a prayer. At first the tabot remained motionless, accompanied by several processional crosses and their attendant brightly colored canopies, while a group of cantors (dabtara) performed the liturgical dance so beloved of the Abyssinians. The dancing over, a procession formed up, headed by the tabot, and slowly circled the church three times in a counter-clockwise direction. Finally the tabot was carried back into the sanctuary; all was over and the assembly broke up. Now in modern times Tabot comes out each time there is a celebration, for example on Jesus' Baptism all churches from the area come together with their tabot and celebrate. AWBuxton, The Abyssinians, p. 65 Looting of tabots Although Ethiopia was never colonized by the British, many tabots were looted by them during the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, also known as the Battle of Magdala, which is a cause of anger among Ethiopians. During the looting of the Ethiopian capital of Magdala in 1868, British soldiers took hundreds of tabots.The Guardian 1 June 2019 Repatriation of looted tabots The return in February 2002 of one looted tabot, discovered in the storage of St. John's Episcopal Church in Edinburgh, was a cause of public rejoicing in Addis Ababa.\\"Ethiopian joy as church returns Ark of Covenant; Handover may\\" by Jenifer Johnston, The Sunday Herald, January 27, 2002 (hosted by Find Articles)\\"Ethiopia: Returning a Tabot\\" by Odhiambo Okite, Christianity Today, 22 April 2002 Another was returned in 2003 after Dr. Ian McLennan recognised the ancient tabot at an auction in London.

Starring Amanda Bynes, it is a romantic comedy about a girl getting stranded with a rock star on a beach in the Caribbean. Originally produced as a feature film by Media 8 Entertainment, the Weinstein Company purchased the rights and, after several failed attempts to interest a theatrical distributor in the U.S., sold the TV rights to the ABC Family Channel - where it finally premiered on January 21, 2007. Plot Jenny Taylor (Amanda Bynes) is a fan of Jason Masters (Chris Carmack), a world-famous rock star, but her efforts to meet him are always thwarted by her nemesis, Alexis (Jamie-Lynn Sigler). Hoping to get another chance, Jenny takes a job at Masters' favorite Caribbean resort, joined by her best friend Ryan (Jonathan Bennett). Jenny sneaks aboard a party vessel Jason is on, and when Jason is washed overboard, Jenny jumps in to save him. Though the pair find themselves marooned in a secluded cove of a seemingly-deserted island, Jenny soon discovers that they have landed a short distance from the resort. She lets him believe they are stranded so she can make him fall in love with her. Jenny gets help from Ryan, who drives out to her location to provide her with supplies. When Alexis discovers Jenny's plan by following Ryan secretly, she also pretends to be marooned with them. While Ryan has been helping, he has also decided to act on his long-standing love for Jenny, seeking advice on asking her out. He completely transforms himself, yet when she sees him, all she talks about is Jason. Ryan confesses he can't stop thinking about her and kisses her, but when Jenny protests that they are friends he tells her that he's going home, and drives off. Jenny feels bad and tells Jason the truth about not being stranded. He gets upset at both Jenny and Alexis, promises to sue them both, and leaves them behind as he hitches a ride back to the resort. When Ryan hears that a storm is going to hit the side of the island where Jenny is he drives out to save her. As the storm builds, Jenny gets stuck in the car Ryan had abandoned to look for her, when Ryan returns just in time to save her as the car is about to slide over a muddy embankment. When he takes Jenny into a cave and lights a fire to keep her warm, she realizes that he is the one that cares for her the most. After the storm passes, Jenny and Ryan return to the resort, where Jason and his manager tell Jenny that they need her help to maintain the 'stranded' story at a press conference. Ryan proclaims his love for Jenny before he is thrown out the door by Jason's bodyguard. At the press conference, Jenny tells everyone that her boyfriend is Ryan and that Alexis is Jason's fiancee, then walks off with Ryan. As the end-credits roll, Jason is on stage in Winnipeg, unhappily dedicating a song to his wife, Alexis, who is standing at his side.

Biography Born in Chewelah, Washington, Monaghan was a part of the first graduating class of Gonzaga University, and ultimately graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1895. For the next two years, as a Passed Midshipman, he served in the cruiser , flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Station. Promoted to the rank of Ensign in July 1897, he was next assigned to the monitor and gunboat , both of which operated along the West Coast of the Americas. In July 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he became an officer of the cruiser , which was then the Pacific Station's flagship. In March 1899 Ensign Monaghan, onboard Philadelphia, was sent to the troubled Samoan Islands. On 1 April, while serving ashore with a combined unit of British, Americans and Samoans, his force was ambushed by another group of rebel Samoans. When his unit's leader, Lieutenant Philip Lansdale, was wounded, Ensign Monaghan seized a rifle and attempted to rescue the injured officer. The official report of the action stated: \\"The men were not in sufficient numbers to hold out any longer, and they were forced along by a fire which it was impossible to withstand. Ensign Monaghan did stand. He stood steadfast by his wounded superior and friend‚Äîone rifle against many, one brave man against a score of savages. He knew he was doomed. He could not yield. He died in heroic performance of duty.\\" Legacy A statue commemorating his death was erected in 1906 in downtown Spokane, Washington.

He had a brief major league playing career, as a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943; he was the first Greek player in MLB history. Campanis is most famous for his position as general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1968 to 1987, from which he was fired on April 8, 1987, as a result of controversial remarks regarding blacks in baseball made during an interview on Nightline two days earlier. Early life Al Campanis was born to Greek- speaking parents in Kos, a small island within the Dodecanese Islands, on November 2, 1916. Kos has been part of Greece since 1947, although, at the time of Campanis' birth, it belonged to Italy. He moved with his family to New York City at age 6. He attended New York University, graduating in 1940. Baseball After graduating, Campanis became a professional baseball player, signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He was sent to play with several minor league teams: the Macon Peaches in 1940, Reading Brooks in 1941, Knoxville Smokies in 1942, and Montreal Royals in 1943. He eventually played for the Brooklyn Dodgers as a second baseman for seven games late in their 1943 season. He then served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of Chief Petty Officer.Gary Bedingfield's Baseball in Wartime: Al Campanis After returning from the war, Campanis rejoined the Montreal Royals. With Montreal in 1946, Campanis played 116 games at shortstop and was teammates with Jackie Robinson, who played 119 games at second base. Campanis remained with Montreal in 1947, while Robinson played for the Dodgers, breaking the baseball color line. Campanis' final season playing professional baseball was 1948, when he was player-manager of the Nashua Dodgers in New Hampshire. Pitcher Dan Bankhead, who in 1947 had become the first African American pitcher in MLB, won 20 games for Nashua in 1948. Campanis soon afterward became a scout for the Dodgers, then eventually their scouting director. While a scout, he notably discovered future Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente and Sandy Koufax. Campanis moved with the team to Los Angeles when they became the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1958. In 1968, Campanis became the Dodgers' general manager. In one of his first trades as general manager, Campanis traded his own son Jim, to the Kansas City Royals for two minor leaguers.www.baseballlibrary.com Under Campanis, the Dodgers reached the World Series four times: 1974, 1977, 1978, and 1981. They lost the first three, before finally winning in 1981. Racial comments Campanis' remarks took place on the late-night ABC News program Nightline, on April 6, 1987, during the run-up to the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's Major League Baseball debut (April 15, 1947). Campanis, who had played alongside Robinson and was known for being close to him, was being interviewed about the subject. Nightline anchorman Ted Koppel asked him why, at the time, there had been few black managers and no black general managers in Major League Baseball. Campanis' reply was that blacks \\"may not have some of the necessities to be, let's say, a field manager, or, perhaps, a general manager\\" for these positions. Elsewhere in the interview, he said that blacks are often poor swimmers \\"because they don't have the buoyancy.\\" Koppel says he gave Campanis several opportunities to clarify, (\\"Do you really believe that?\\") or back down from his remarks, but Campanis confirmed his views with his replies. Koppel also pointed out that much of what Campanis was saying \\"sounds a lot like the garbage we heard 40 years ago.\\" Campanis was fired less than 48 hours later. The controversy was especially heated when it was pointed out that Campanis had participated in the decision over who would replace Walter Alston as the manager of the Dodgers. It had been a choice between the two coaches at the time, Tommy Lasorda and Jim Gilliam, and it raised the question of whether Gilliam had been passed over because he was black. In an interview the next year, Campanis attempted to clarify that he was referring to the lack of African-Americans with experience in these areas, rather than their innate abilities. He also said that he was \\"wiped out\\" when the interview took place and therefore not entirely himself. Many other figures in baseball, such as Lasorda and African-American and Latin players who played for the Dodgers, have also spoken in Campanis' defense.Al Campanis -- forever a racist? Jewish World Review, July 2, 1998 In 1988, Campanis also said that \\"Time has diffused the immediate hurt of April 6\\", and that \\"It has turned out to be a plus for baseball and myself.\\" The Dodgers went on to win the World Series that year. Personal life and family Campanis had two sons, baseball player Jim and George. Death Campanis died on June 21, 1998, at his home in Fullerton, California, from coronary artery disease, at age 81. Campanis was survived by his sons, George and Jim, five grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. He was interred in the mausoleum crypt at Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton.

Her most famous work is the time-slip fantasy novel Tom's Midnight Garden, which won the 1958 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, as the year's outstanding children's book by a British subject. Pearce was a commended runner-up for the Medal a further four times. Early life The youngest of four children of a flour miller and corn merchant, Ernest Alexander Pearce, and his wife Gertrude Alice n√©e Ramsden, Philippa Pearce was born in the village of Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, and brought up there on the River Cam at the Mill House.Biography on the flyleaf of a 1987 reprint of the Puffin Books edition of her first children's novel, Minnow on the Say; ODNB entry by Nicholas Tucker retrieved 22 July 2013. Pay/walled. Starting school late at the age of eight because of illness, she was educated at the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, and went on to Girton College, Cambridge on a scholarship to read English and History. After gaining her degree, Pearce moved to London, where she found work as a civil servant. Later she wrote and produced schools' radio programmes for the BBC, where she remained for 13 years. She was a children's editor at the Oxford University Press from 1958 to 1960 and at the Andr√© Deutsch publishing firm from 1960 to 1967. Writing career In 1951 Pearce spent a long period in hospital recovering from tuberculosis. She passed the time there thinking about a canoe trip she had taken many years before, which became the inspiration for her first book, a 241-page novel Minnow on the Say, published by Oxford in 1955 with illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. It was a commended runner-up for the annual Carnegie Medal. Like several of her subsequent books, it was inspired by the area where she had been raised: the villages of Great and Little Shelford became Great and Little Barley. Cambridge became Castleford in the book (nothing to do with the real town of the same name in West Yorkshire) and lost its university; the River Cam became the River Say. Minnow was published in the US as The Minnow Leads to Treasure (1958).\\"The Minnow leads to treasure\\". Library of Congress Catalog record. Retrieved 9 July 2012. It was adapted for television in Canada as a 1960 TV series with the original title, and for British television in 1972 as Treasure over the Water. Pearce's second book was Tom's Midnight Garden, published by Oxford in 1958. Its \\"midnight garden\\" was based directly on the garden of the Mill House where Pearce was raised. The novel has become one of the classic \\"time slip\\" stories, inspiring a film, a stage play and three TV versions. It won the annual Carnegie Medal and for the 70th anniversary celebration in 2007, a panel named it one of the top ten Medal-winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation's favourite. Tom's Midnight Garden finished second in the vote from that shortlist, between two books that were about 40 years younger. Pearce wrote over 30 books, including A Dog So Small (1962), The Squirrel Wife (1971), The Battle of Bubble and Squeak (1978) and The Way To Sattin Shore (1983). The Shadow Cage and other tales of the supernatural (1977), Bubble and Squeak, and Sattin Shore were the later three of her four Carnegie Medal runners-up. The Battle of Bubble and Squeak inspired a two-part television adaptation in Channel 4's Talk, Write and Read series of educational programming. Although not a prolific author of full-length books, Philippa Pearce continued to work over subsequent years, as well as speaking at conferences, editing anthologies and writing short stories. She attended a 2002 reception for children's authors at Number 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister. In 2004 Pearce published her first new full-length book for two decades, The Little Gentleman.

The film was directed by Bruce Beresford, produced by Martin Elfand and written by Andrew Birkin. The film stars Richard Gere in the title role, alongside ensemble cast such as: Edward Woodward, Alice Krige, Denis Quilley, Cherie Lunghi, Hurd Hatfield, Jack Klaff, John Castle, Tim Woodward, George Eastman, Christopher Malcolm, Gina Bellman and James Coombes in supporting roles. King David was released by Paramount Pictures which was also the production company, on March 29, 1985, while in other countries it was released in 1986 and 1987. Upon release, the film received mostly negative reviews for its screenplay writing, pace, some of the acting and the action sequences. However, Gere's performance and the cinematography were praised. In addition to being a critical failure, the film was also a box-office failure, grossing $5.9 million worldwide against its $21 million production budget. Synopsis The film follows the life of David, drawing mainly from biblical accounts, especially I and II Samuel, I Chronicles, and the Psalms of David. Cast Production =Development= In July 1978 Michael Eisner of Paramount said he wanted the studio to make a Biblical film for release in 1981. This was a King David script. According to Andrew Birkin, who was one of the later writers, the studio were attracted to the story because of its parallels to Star Wars with David as Luke Skywalker and Samuel as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Jeffrey Katzenberg of Paramount met Bruce Beresford at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980 when the director was there with Breaker Morant. He gave Beresford the script. Beresford \\"liked the story, didn't like the script\\" so bought in Andrew Birkin \\"who's come up with an outstanding screenplay.\\" Birkin felt David's story was more ideal for a ten- hour mini series and struggled to include key elements like Samuel. \\"I found the brutality of te Old Testament hard to take\\" said Birkin. \\"I hadn't realized that God's commandments were set out so clearly -there's no pink pages. It was hard to make God a hero. It was also hard in 1984 to write a film about our late lamented Imperialists. This is not a Ten Commandments story of beleagured people in exile. David was the Cecil Rhodes of Ancient Israel. It was hard to make a case for him, the kind who carved an empire according to the map devised by Abraham.\\" Beresford said, \\"The forces that impinged on David, the decisions he had to make, the relationships he had with people and with God and the way he felt about Him ‚Äì it becomes fascinating when you follow everything that happened to David from his childhood to his death.\\" \\"What made David fascinating were his strengths and weaknesses\\", said Beresford. Beresford watched a number of Biblical films and was most impressed by The Gospel According to St Matthew and Jesus of Nazareth. In June 1982 Beresford said he would make the film for Paramount, after he made Tender Mercies. In February 1983 he said the budget would be $16 million and \\"it's got an absolutely wonderful script. I think we've gotten away from all of those old cliches of Hollywood biblical movies.\\" \\"What I want to do is make a different sort of Biblical film\\", he said. \\"The ones Hollywood made in the past were far too reverential. It was as if the moment they got hold of the Bible they became awestruck. The actors fell over themselves to be sententious and all those heavenly choirs and shafts of light... The only way is for actors to speak the lines normally not as if they were inverted commas.\\" \\"Religion has to come into King David, because it was part of everybody's everyday life then\\", said Beresford. \\"People used to talk about God like we talk about going to a restaurant. They'd say: 'God did this. God did that.' But the emotional experiences in the film will be easily recognizable because they're so universal.\\" Beresford wanted American actors rather than English ones to give the movie a more contemporary feel. The producer said he personally chose Richard Gere to play the lead. However a later report said Beresford wanted to use an unknown and Gere was forced upon him. \\"Bruce knew what the reaction would be toward Gere in the role\\", said the source. \\"He knew it would be ridiculous, but, once he'd signed on, he couldn't just walk off. He knew that if he did, he'd never work in Hollywood again.\\" The film was originally going to be shot in Israel. Eventually it was decided this was impractical as Israel did not have any buildings older than the Roman Empire. They considered Morocco and Tunisia before settling on Italy. =Filming= Filming started in May 1984 in England, by which time the budget was $23 million. Locations included Matera and Craco both in Basilicata, and Campo Imperatore in Abruzzo, the Lanaitto valley (Oliena) in Sardinia, Italy, and at Pinewood Studios in England. It was a difficult shoot. Both Beresford and Gere came down with viruses. Extras went on strike for more pay. Many locations were remote. The script used was the ninth draft. \\"\\"Normally if you're making an ordinary movie and the weather turns bad you say: Oh well, we'll shoot tomorrow\\", said Beresford. \\"But if you've got 2,000 extras there and suddenly it starts snowing-as it did with us-it's useless saying: I can't shoot in this. You've got to because you can't get the people back again.\\" According to one report \\"Gere knew Beresford wanted him replaced, and that made for quite a bit of friction on the set. Beresford did what he wanted to do in the scenes where Gere doesn't appear, and Gere did what he wanted to do in his scenes. The film ended up as a multi-million dollar joke that everyone thinks is funny except the people who made it and the Paramount investors.\\" Beresford later said \\"\\"The King David script was just never right. We started off on the wrong foot and then it turned into a catalogue of disaster. Really, I don't know how I got mixed up in such a mess ‚Äì I felt like the captain of the Titanic heading toward a critical iceberg and I hit it. It was inevitable.\\" Reception =Critical= The film was not well received by the critics, with The New York Times calling it \\"not a good film\\". Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 'rotten' 8% rating. Richard Gere's performance in the film earned him a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor, which he lost to Sylvester Stallone for Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV. =Box Office= Beresford said \\"\\"The film cost $22 million and lost it all ‚Äì and more.And the minute the movie died, I checked out a list of famous directors who also had works that bombed ‚Äì to see if they ever got back on the right foot again.\\" =Aftermath= Years later, Bruce Beresford said of the film: > I think there are a few things in it that are interesting. But, I think > there are so many things that are wrong. We never liked the script... we > never really caught the friendship between David and Jonathan. There weren't > enough scenes between them. And David, himself ‚Äì I think Richard Gere was > miscast. He is a wonderful actor but he is much better in contemporary > pieces.

There are different types of these groups in the Scene: release groups and courier groups. Groups often compete, as being the first to bring out a new quality release can bring status and respect ‚Äì a type of \\"vanity contest\\". The warez groups care about the image others have of them. Description ANALOG Computing observed in 1984 that software piracy did not make sense economically to those performing the software cracking. The primary motivation of warez groups is not monetary gain, but the excitement of breaking rules and beating competitors. Although at least two Scene groups have been asking for bitcoin donations, PoWeRUp and spamTV. Individual members of these groups are usually also the authors of cracks and keygens. There are warez groups publishing new content outside of the Scene, often referred to as P2P groups. They are a lot more accessible for people with access to new movies and are not limited to a set of rules and regulations. The FBI have been combating warez groups with Operation: Cyberstrike, Operation Buccaneer, Operation Fastlink, Operation Safehaven and Operation Site Down. Similarly, the P2P group IMAGiNE has been disbanded due to law enforcement actions. Some game and software groups include Razor 1911, Reloaded, DrinkOrDie, Pirates With Attitude, Class, Myth and Fairlight. For a larger list, see the list of warez groups. Release groups Release groups are responsible for making warez releases. For example, they rip a movie from DVD, encode it to a video file and chop it up in smaller pieces before sharing it. They are at the top of the warez world. An announcement of the release shows up in pre databases after making the release available on their affiliate sites. Access to the original software products is necessary to write cracks and keygens so they share original media among each other, usually using private sites and servers. Communication between members happens with IRC. Warez groups typically add NFO files with their releases. Due to the nature of the scene, not much is known about these groups. Most groups follow one of the different warez standards to prevent being nuked. Most groups are focused on a single category (music, movies, television, ...) or genre (e.g. metal music or graffiti). The group members have different roles. Most groups have one or more group leaders, aided by people with assignments such as supplier, cracker or ripper. Courier groups Courier groups take releases and distribute them. This can be done using FXP to FTP sites. There are more couriers in the scene than there are crackers, suppliers and sites combined. Couriers are a specific class of topsite users who earn their access by uploading new releases and filling requests. When a courier gains access to a topsite, they are often required to pass a trial test such as uploading a certain amount in a short period of time. Couriers compete (race) against each other for respect, credits, access to other topsites, and fun. Private couriers often operate as independent (iND) couriers. Some couriers band together to form courier groups which provide support and friendship through camaraderie. Although it may be noted that Couriers/Racers are looked down upon more than ever by affiliates and topsite staff with the increase of scripts that perform the couriers tasks automatically.

It is connected with Va≈≠kavysk by a railroad branch and with Hrodna by a highway. International phone number prefix: 375-15-13. History Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Svislach was part of Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. In 1795, Svislach was acquired by the Russian Empire in the course of the Third Partition of Poland. In 1927, Rabbi Chaim Yaakov Mishkinsky, whose wife Chaya was the granddaughter of Rabbi Naftali Hertz Halperin of Bialystok, was appointed the rabbi of Svislach. He led the community until the Nazis entered in November 1942 murdering the entire Jewish community. Prior to the war, Rabbi Mishkinsky sent his sons and to Israel (Palestine). Rabbi Mishkinsky's great-granddaughter, Batya Friedman, serves as rebbetzin of Hampstead Garden Suburb Synagogue, London. His great-grandson is Rabbi Yochanan Ivry of Congregation Toras Emes of Staten Island, New York. Svislach was part of the Second Polish Republic from 1921 until 1939. In September 1939, Svislach was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. In 1939, there were around 3,000 Jews living in Svislach, along with refugees from western Poland who had settled there after the invasion of Poland. From June 1941 until 17 July 1944, Svislach was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of Bezirk Bialystok. In July 1941, a ghetto was established in the old Jewish neighbourhood, in the northwest of Svislach. In that area, Jews were also gathered from the village of Golobudy. It was an open ghetto, and the western border of the ghetto‚Äôs territory ran near the Svislach River. On November 2, 1942, the ghetto was liquidated when the Jews were sent by train to the Vawkavysk transit camp where many massacres occurred. The remaining Jews, mostly elderly and sick, were killed in the Visnik Forest, just outside Svislach.http://yahadmap.org/#village/svisloch- grodno-belarus.471 Residents Notable residents include: * Rabbi Aharon Kotler * Rabbi Samuel Belkin * David Lewis (Losz), Canadian Rhodes Scholar and federal New Democratic Party leader.

She was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council between September 1993 and November 2006, representing Doutta Galla Province. Gould was born in Melbourne, and finished her secondary studies at a technical college in the suburb of Macleod. She became involved in the Manufacturing Grocers Association trade union, which later merged with the National Union of Workers. In 1980, she became its General Vice-President ‚Äì a position which she held until her election to parliament. She was also a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions executive between 1991 and 1993. In 1993, Gould decided to make a move into politics, and succeeded in securing Labor pre- selection for a by-election in the seat of Doutta Galla Province. During her first term, which was only three years, because of the circumstances of her election, she was a member of the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee. She was re-elected in 1996, and was subsequently appointed Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council and Shadow Minister for Aged Care. Gould also became a member of both the Law Reform and Legislative Council Privileges Committees. In the months leading up to the 1999 election, Gould was again promoted ‚Äì this time to the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council. She was also made responsible for the Housing portfolio. In late 1999, the Labor Party won government, defeating Premier Jeff Kennett's Liberal government. Gould continued on as Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council, and continued her rise, becoming the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Minister for WorkCover. By February 2002, Gould was demoted. She was appointed to the new position of Minister for Education Services and Youth Affairs. After the 2002 election, Gould was dumped from the ministry.

Accessed 4 July 2008. was a New Zealand economist who spent most of his academic career as a professor of economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). His best-known contribution to economics is the Phillips curve, which he first described in 1958. He also designed and built the MONIAC hydraulic economics computer in 1949. Early life Phillips was born at Te Rehunga near Dannevirke, New Zealand, to Harold Housego Phillips, a dairy farmer, and his wife, Edith Webber, a schoolteacher and postmistress. He left New Zealand before finishing school to work in Australia at a variety of jobs, including crocodile hunter and cinema manager. In 1937 Phillips headed to China, but had to escape to Russia when Japan invaded China. He travelled across Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway and made his way to Britain in 1938, where he studied electrical engineering. At the outbreak of World War II, Phillips joined the Royal Air Force and was sent to Singapore. When Singapore fell, he escaped on the troopship Empire State, which came under attack before safely arriving in Java. When Java, too, was overrun Phillips was captured by the Japanese, and spent three and a half years interned in a prisoner of war camp in the then Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). During this period he learned Chinese from other prisoners, repaired and miniaturised a secret radio, and fashioned a secret water boiler for tea which he hooked into the camp lighting system. In 1946, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his war service. After the war he moved to London and began studying sociology at the London School of Economics, because of his fascination with prisoners of war's ability to organize themselves. But he became bored with sociology and developed an interest in Keynesian theory, so he switched his course to economics and within eleven years was a professor of economics. Economics career Phillips with his MONIAC computer While a student at the LSE Phillips used his training as an engineer to develop MONIAC, an analogue computer which used hydraulics to model the workings of the British economy, inspiring the term hydraulic macroeconomics. It was very well received and Phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the LSE. He advanced from assistant lecturer in 1951 to professor in 1958. His work focused on British data and observed that in years when the unemployment rate was high, wages tended to be stable, or possibly fall. Conversely, when unemployment was low, wages rose rapidly. This sort of pattern had been noticed earlier by Irving Fisher, but in 1958 Phillips published his own work on the relationship between inflation and unemployment, illustrated by the Phillips curve. Soon after the publication of Phillips' paper, the idea that there was a trade-off between a strong economy and low inflation caught the imagination of academic economists and policy-makers alike. Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote an influential article describing the possibilities suggested by the Phillips curve in the context of the United States. What people think of as the Phillips curve has changed substantially over time, but remains an important feature of macroeconomic analysis of economic fluctuations. Had he lived longer, Phillips' contributions might have been worthy of a Nobel Prize in economics. He made several other notable contributions to economics, particularly relating to stabilization policy. He returned to Australia in 1967 for a position at Australian National University which allowed him to devote half his time to Chinese studies. In 1969 the effects of his war deprivations and smoking caught up with him. He had a stroke, prompting an early retirement and return to Auckland, New Zealand, where he taught at the University of Auckland. He died in Auckland on 4 March 1975.

is termed syntagmatic analysis. Paradigmatic analysis often uses commutation tests, i.e. analysis by substituting words of the same type or class to calibrate shifts in connotation. Definition of terms In Semiotic literary criticism, a syntagm (or syntagma) is a building block of a text into which meaning is encoded by the writer and decoded by the reader, recalling past experience and placing the message in its appropriate cultural context. Individual syntagms can be arranged together to form more complex syntagms: groups of sounds (and the letters to represent them) form words, groups of words form sentences, sentences form narratives, and so on. A list of syntagms of the same type is called a paradigm. So, in English, the alphabet is the paradigm from which the syntagms of words are formed. The set of words collected together in a lexicon becomes the paradigm from which sentences etc. are formed. Hence, paradigmatic analysis is a method for exploring a syntagm by identifying its constituent paradigm, studying the individual paradigmatic elements, and then reconstructing the process by which the syntagm takes on meaning. The importance of paradigmatic relationships and paradigmatic analysis includes contrasting and comparing each of the meanings present in each text in which similar circumstances will be chosen. This helps to define value in the text. The importance of relations of paradigmatic opposition is to help generate an order of dynamic complexity of experience in the past. People have believed in binary opposition since at least classical times: e.g. in Aristotle's physics of four elements earth, air, fire and water, the relations among these are all binary oppositions that are believed to make up the world.from http://visual- memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem05.html Jakobson and Ritchie Roman Jakobson's model on the functions of language has two levels of description: *the various component elements forming language, and *what humans do with the language when they use it. In the first place, every language has a vocabulary and a syntax. Its elements are words with fixed denotative meanings. Out of these one can construct, according to the rules of the syntax, composite symbols with resultant new meanings. Secondly, in a language, some words are equivalent to whole combinations of other words, so that most meanings can be expressed in several different ways. Studies of human perception show that to some extent, what people perceive depends on what they expect to perceive. L. David Ritchie proposes that communication creates relationships between what is perceived or known by one person and what is perceived or known by others; the form of the communication will be determined in part by whether there are pre-existing relationships between the communicator and the audience. The receiver and originator of a message must work from some common understanding of what sorts of patterns are used to communicate and how these patterns are related to other events. Communication has to do with community both in the sense that it relies on having something in common in the first place and in the sense that it can influence what the communicants subsequently have in common. Applied to music In music, paradigmatic analysis was a method of musical analysis developed by Nicolas Ruwet during the 1960s but later named by others. It is \\"based on the concept of 'equivalence'. Ruwet argued that the most striking characteristic of musical syntax was the central role of repetition ‚Äì and, by extension, of varied repetition or transformation (Ruwet 1987)\\" (Middleton 1990/2002, p. 183). Paradigmatic analysis assumes that Roman Jakobson's description of the poetic system (1960, p. 358) applies to music and that in both a \\"projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection on to the axis of combination\\" occurs. Thus paradigmatic analyses are able to base the assignment of units entirely on repetition so that \\"anything repeated (straight or varied) is defined as a unit, and this is true on all levels,\\" from sections to phrases and individual sounds (Middleton, ibid).

Co-created by writer-editor Stan Lee and penciller Jack Kirby, he starred in his own continuing feature that debuted in Amazing Adventures #1 (June 1961). Publication history In his earliest five appearances, in Amazing Adventures #1‚Äì4 & #6 (June‚ÄìSept. & Nov. 1961), the character was called Doctor Droom. The first strip was written by Stan Lee, penciled by Jack Kirby, and inked by Steve Ditko. Doctor Droom vanished into obscurity for years after the series was re-titled and reformatted as Amazing Adult Fantasy with #7. According to Lee, Doctor Droom was essentially succeeded by Doctor Strange: \\"... I always liked [Doctor Droom], but I forgot about him. It was a one-shot thing. And one day while we were trying to think of some new heroes, I thought I'd like to bring back a magician. And I gave him the name Doctor Strange ...\\" Thanks to editor Roger Stern, Doctor Droom resurfaced in the 1970s in the final four issues of Marvel's reprint title Weird Wonder Tales. Issue #19 \\"introduced\\" Doctor Druid in a reprint of his Amazing Adventures debut as Droom, but under a new name conceived by Len Wein, presumably to avoid confusion with Marvel supervillain Doctor Doom. Another modified Droom reprint appeared in issue #20. Then in #21-22, he served as \\"host\\" to introduce older fantasy stories. The next and final issue of Weird Wonder Tales contained a new splash page with John Byrne art leading into a reprint of the second Droom story from Amazing Adventures, wherein Druid's original, drab grey clothing was painted over with his new red uniform. Writers Len Wein and Jim Shooter used the character at the time in The Incredible Hulk #210-211 and Ghost Rider #26. Roger Stern then had him make guest appearances in the Avengers in the 1980s. He starred in the miniseries Druid #1‚Äì4 (May‚ÄìAug. 1995) by writer Warren Ellis and artist Leonardo Manco. In Marvel Universe #4‚Äì7 (Sept.‚ÄìDec. 1998), he was retconned as a member of the Monster Hunters, whose adventures took place between the \\"Age of Monsters\\" and the \\"Age of Heroes\\". This theme would be picked up with his appearance in issue #2 of a subsequent flashback title, Marvel: The Lost Generation. Doctor Druid was one of the feature characters in the 2011 three-issue limited series Chaos War: Dead Avengers. Fictional character biography Weird Wonder Tales #19 (Dec. 1976), an edited reprint of \\"I Am the Fantastic Dr. Droom\\" from Amazing Adventures #1 (June 1961). Art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko Doctor Druid's real name is Dr. Anthony Ludgate Druid, although he usually refers to himself as Dr. Anthony Druid. He is a psychiatrist and explorer as well as a minor telepath and magician, specializing mostly in hypnosis and other feats of mesmerism. He has minor magical abilities that have varied over the years. He is also an expert on the occult, having been trained by a Tibetan lama who had come to the U.S. for medical attention. Many years later, Druid discovered that the lama was, in fact, the Ancient OneAvengers Spotlight #37 (Oct. 1990) who selected Anthony Druid as a back-up in case his grooming of Doctor Strange failed. Doctor Druid remained on the sidelines for years. He eventually appeared again and teamed with the Hulk against the Maha Yogi.Incredible Hulk #210‚Äì211 With the Avengers, he encountered the Fomor and his ancestor Amergin.The Avengers #225‚Äì226 (Nov.-Dec. 1982) Doctor Druid sometime later aided the Avengers in thwarting Baron Zemo and the fourth Masters of Evil's takeover of Avengers Mansion, making contact with the mentally damaged Blackout and helping him resist Zemo's control while also prompting him to bring Avengers Mansion back to Earth after banishing it into his Darkforce Dimension.Avengers #276 (Feb. 1987) He joined the ranks of the Avengers shortly after helping to defend from this attack.The Avengers #278 (April 1987) He battled a Dracula doppelganger in the realm of Death.West Coast Avengers Annual #2 (1987); Avengers Annual #16 (1987) His membership was tainted when he was mind controlled by supervillainess the Terminatrix (at the time impersonating the space pirate Nebula) into manipulating the team on her behalf. While in this state, he even assumed chairmanship of the team for a very short period.The Avengers #295 (Sept. 1988) When \\"Nebula\\" was cast into Limbo, Druid followed, as he was still under her thrall.The Avengers #297 (Nov. 1988) He eventually regained control of his own mind and returned to Earth, where, after learning his true origin, banished \\"Nebula\\" and became younger by magic.Fantastic Four #337‚Äì338 (Feb.-March 1990) Due to his actions while in the villain's thrall, Druid was disgraced. He was briefly reunited with his former teammates while working with Doctor Strange during the Infinity War, and later became the leader of the Secret Defenders.Secret Defenders #15 (May 1994) In that role, he was once again victimized by a villain's mind control, this time by the demon Slorioth. Doctor Druid and the demon were defeated, Druid faked his own death, and the team disbanded.Secret Defenders #25 (March 1995) He then abandoned his spandex costume and became even more of a real, traditional druid, a fact reflected by his taking on the simple name of \\"Druid\\" and the new nature of his nature powers,Druid #1 (May 1995) but he let his feelings of rage and power lust take him over, went insane, was betrayed by his allies, and was finally killed by Hellstorm, the putative Son of Satan.Druid #4 (Aug. 1995) Druid's ghost appeared later alongside the spirits of other dead ex-Avengers, confirming that Druid had, in fact, died this time.The Avengers vol. 3, #10‚Äì11 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1998) The Avengers later placed a memorial statue of him in the garden of Avengers Mansion. A mere 36 hours before his death, Druid is visited by a time-traveling Black Widow. He happily assisted her with magical research pertaining to her mission, no wiser of his imminent demise.Secret Avengers #20 (Feb 2012) Doctor Druid's son is introduced as one of Nick Fury's new recruits to fight against the Secret Invasion.The Mighty Avengers #13 (July 2008) Secret Invasion #4 reveals that he is operating under the name of Druid. During the Chaos War storyline, Doctor Druid is among the dead heroes brought back to life when Amatsu-Mikaboshi dominated the death realms.Chaos War: Dead Avengers #1 As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Doctor Druid resurfaced on Weirdworld. Nighthawk of Earth-31916, Blur of Earth-148611 and Tyndall were captured by Doctor Druid's minions and taken to his castle. He revealed to his captives that his soul took on a corporeal form when it found Weirdworld, where he remained so that he can still be alive. Doctor Druid also revealed that Ogeode built him a massive crystal on top of his castle to amplify his mind-control abilities, which brought anyone in his part of Weirdworld under his thrall. For some reason, Thundra and Tyndall were immune to his effects due to something related to time-travel.Squadron Supreme Vol. 4 #4 Powers and abilities Doctor Druid's latent mystical abilities were activated by the Ancient One.Avengers Spotlight #37 (Oct. 1990) He has a variety of psionic abilities including telepathy which enables him to scan or project his thoughts to any mind on Earth, the ability to mesmerize minds less adept than his own, and the ability to perform mass hypnosis. Doctor Druid's hypnotic abilities enable him to achieve numerous illusory effects, including invisibility, altering the appearance of himself and others, and the projection of illusionary objects or beings. He has psychokinetic powers enabling him to levitate himself or other people and objects. Doctor Druid has limited precognitive abilities and can sense the presence of recent uses of magic and trace them to their sources. Doctor Druid's druidic powers have a special vulnerability to iron, as did the powers of his ancestors. Iron tends to act as a lightning rod for the magical forces he employs, sometimes disrupting their effects. Doctor Druid employs the mystical knowledge and skills of the ancient druids. Through magic rituals that may involve chants, runes, candles, potions, mystic symbols, and other such preparations, Doctor Druid can achieve various magical feats. These rituals tap the inherent mystical energies in natural objects and materials. Doctor Druid possesses various Celtic mystical artifacts as well. At one time, Druid even had access to the Moebius Stone, which was a mystic item created by Agamotto that had a limited ability to manipulate time. The stone was able to raise the dead, absorb the life-force of another, and accelerate or reverse the passage of time within a confined area, though sometimes random time-related side effects occurred. Doctor Druid eventually destroyed the artifact because he felt it was too powerful to fall into the wrong hands. Doctor Druid can also call upon the Celtic war goddesses Morrigan, Macha, and Badb for mystical assistance. Doctor Druid also possesses various yogic abilities, including control over involuntary functions of his body such as his heartbeat, respiration, bleeding, and reaction to pain. In his latest and final incarnation, when he was called only \\"Druid\\", he has been seen manipulating fire, and making a tree instantaneously grow in a person's stomach from the seeds of an eaten apple. These powers were nature-based (elements, plants, etc.) as the druids of old worshipped nature. Druid has earned an M.D. from Harvard, completed a residency in psychiatry, and has extensive knowledge of occult lore, especially Celtic lore.

He is a former professional rugby union player who played for Scotland and, for the most part of his career, Edinburgh. Paterson is Scotland's record points scorer with 809 points and second most-capped player with 109 caps. He is capable of playing in a range of positions, including fullback, wing and fly-half. Paterson retired from international rugby in December 2011 and as a professional player in May 2012. Early career Paterson started his rugby career with hometown club Gala, the highlight being a solo try that won Gala the 1999 Scottish Cup at Murrayfield. Soon after Paterson turned professional by signing for Glasgowhttp://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12344372.No_headline/ where he played only two games before signing for Edinburgh Rugby. In becoming a professional player he dropped out of the University of Edinburgh where he was studying to become a PE teacher. Edinburgh From 2000 until 2002 Paterson played in the Scottish/Welsh League, the predecessor to the competition now known as Pro14 (prior to the addition of Irish teams). He was part of the Edinburgh squad that reached the Heineken Cup quarter finals in 2003‚Äì04. For seven years he was a mainstay of the Edinburgh squad. With the ongoing dispute between the SRU and then Edinburgh Rugby owner Bob Carruthers over the refusal to release Edinburgh players for a pre-2007 World Cup training camp, Paterson left Edinburgh for Gloucester by mutual consent. On 24 July 2007, Paterson signed a three-year contract with Gloucester. Gloucester His spell with Gloucester was largely disappointing due to limited game time throughout the 2007‚Äì08 season. It was announced on 2 May 2008 that Paterson would return to Edinburgh Rugby for the 2008‚Äì09 season He played 14 games during his stay scoring 38 points, the highlight being a 50-metre breakaway try in the derby game against BathRugby videos of tackles, tries, funny incidents and more: Chris Patersons still got the gas Edinburgh Paterson re-signed for Edinburgh Rugby upon leaving Gloucester and has remained a fixture in the line up ever since. One of Paterson's top skills ‚Äì his goal-kicking ‚Äì was typified in Edinburgh Rugby's last home game of the 2008‚Äì09 Celtic League season which saw a 43‚Äì3 home win against Newport Gwent Dragons on 9 May 2009. Paterson scored 28 points, kicking nine from nine with five penalties, four conversions and a try. As of 4 April 2012, Paterson is the 5th highest points scorer in Pro12 history with 778 points (21T 113C 4D 145P).RaboDirectPRO12 : Stats : Player Records He played his last ever professional match against Benetton Treviso on 5 May 2012 at Murrayfield Stadium. Despite an unusually long absence from the score sheet partly owing to injury, Paterson scored Edinburgh Rugby's third try of the match leading to a 44‚Äì21 victory. International career =Early Career 1999‚Äì2003= Paterson earned his first cap for Scotland against Spain in the 1999 Rugby World Cup as a fullback. This was his only appearance during the 1999 World Cup. Scotland went on to reach the quarter finals before losing 30‚Äì18 to New Zealand. In his next appearance during the 2000 Six Nations Championship game versus France, Paterson scored his first points for Scotland converting two penalties and a conversion in the 16‚Äì28 loss. Later that year Paterson scored his first Scotland try during the 2000 tour of New Zealand during the 48‚Äì14 loss at Eden Park, Auckland. During the subsequent years Paterson became a fixture in the Scotland team. His consistent performance for club and country earned him a place in Scotland's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad. During Scotland's opening 2003 Rugby World Cup game Paterson scored two tries and kicked a conversion and a penalty during a 32‚Äì11 win against Japan. In the next game against the United States Paterson scored 19 points, including a try, during a 39‚Äì15 win. Paterson played in the subsequent win and loss against Fiji and France to help Scotland qualify for the quarter final stage. In the 2003 Rugby World cup quarter-finals, Scotland lost 33‚Äì16 to Australia at Lang Park, Brisbane. Paterson scored 71 points during the 2003 Rugby World Cup and was named the team's player of the tournament. =2003‚Äì2007= On 15 November 2004 during Scotland's record 100‚Äì8 win over Japan game at McDiarmid Park, Perth he overtook Andy Irvine to become Scotland's second highest points scorer, behind Gavin Hastings. He scored 40 points (three tries, 11 conversions and one penalty). This remains a record points haul for a Scottish player in a test match. Two weeks later on 27 November 2004 against South Africa he became the youngest, and lightest, Scottish player ever to earn 50 caps, aged 26, and weighing in at 78 kg. On 26 February 2005, Paterson equalled the scoring record set by Gavin Hastings for one game of six penalties converted in the 18‚Äì13 win over Italy. Paterson was the BBC's full-back of the 2005 Six Nations Championship. As a result of his incredibly reliable kicking and elusive running from full-back during the 2005 Six Nations Championship, especially in the Calcutta Cup game, Paterson's omission from Clive Woodward's squad for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand surprised many critics and fans alike. This fueled criticism that Woodward relied too much upon his England team who had won the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Ultimately, Woodward's 2005 Lions were unsuccessful losing the test series 3‚Äì0. Paterson played as part of a resurgent Scotland team of the 2006 Six Nations Championship who recorded wins over France, England and Italy to finish third in the table. This remains Scotland's best finish since the 5 Nations became the 6 Nations with the addition of Italy in 2000. Paterson was captain during the 2007 Six Nations Championship as Jason White was injured. Paterson was picked in Scotland's 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. This his third World Cup campaign. Similarly, with the previous two in 1999 & 2003 Scotland exited in the quarter final stage losing 19‚Äì13 to Argentina at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis. Paterson played in all five of Scotland's games scoring 46 points. He deployed a flawless kicking performance on the final stage group game, a decider against Italy (against whom they had suffered a home defeat at the previous Six Nations): Paterson secured qualification by scoring all points of Scotland's narrow 18‚Äì16 victory, with an impeccable 6 out of 6 kicking performance. =Later career 2008‚Äì2011= On 9 February 2008, Paterson earned his 83rd cap for Scotland against Wales, passing the record of Gregor Townsend for a Scottish back. Scotland then went on to lose this match. Later that year on 14 June 2008 he won his 88th cap to break Scott Murray's Scotland appearance record and was named man of the match in Scotland's 26‚Äì14 victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires. During the 2009 Autumn International against Australia, Paterson scored winning points in Scotland's historic 9‚Äì8 win. This was Scotland's first win over Australia for 27 years. On 7 February 2010, Paterson won his 99th cap in Scotland's opening 2010 Six Nations Championship match against France. On Saturday 13 February 2010 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Paterson became the first player to reach 100 caps for Scotland when he played in the defeat against Wales.Wales claim a stunning triumph  Live Rugby Match Pack  ESPN Scrum In the same game Paterson was seriously injured, suffering a split kidney which forced him to miss the rest of the season.

Along with Nikki Walker and Nathan Hines, he was one of three players in that match who had also been in the Scotland team that beat South Africa in 2002. During the 2011 Six Nations Championship Paterson was the 23rd man in the squad when he travelled to Paris but played no part. Following Scotland's poor defeat to Wales in the second game of the tournament, Paterson was recalled to the starting 15 for the Ireland, England and Italy games. In addition to scoring 31 points with the boot in these three matches he justified his inclusion with an impressive try-saving tackle on Ben Foden, when the England Fullback seemed certain to score.Rugby videos of tackles, tries, funny incidents and more: Chris Paterson's fantastic try saving tackle on Ben Foden This helped to keep Scotland in with a chance of winning the game until the last few minutes, although they eventually lost 22‚Äì16.

Paterson announced his retirement from international rugby in December 2011; at the time, he held many of the most significant Scottish career records. His 109 caps was more than 20 clear of then-second-placed Scott Murray; his 96 starts are also the most in Scotland history. He remained Scotland's most-capped player until Ross Ford overtook him in 2017. Paterson was also involved in more defeats (65) than any other Scotland internationalist. Despite not being a regular kicker until after he had amassed 26 caps, he retired as Scotland's all-time leader in points (809), conversions (86) and penalties (140). Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his Scotland career was his versatility; he retired as one of Scotland's three top cap-winners at two different positions. Paterson's 49 caps on the wing were third to Kenny Logan (63) and Sean Lamont (52); his 43 caps as a fullback were also third, this time to Gavin Hastings (61) and Andy Irvine (47). In addition, he has the most caps of any player from the Home Unions (England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales) who did not appear in a Test with the British and Irish Lions. =Coaching and rugby ambassador 2012 onwards= In May 2012 it was announced that Paterson would take on the dual role of specialist coach and ambassador with the Scottish Rugby Union.Scottish Rugby - Paterson To Inspire Next Generation Kicking Accuracy During his time as Scotland's and Edinburgh Rugby's goal kicker Paterson amassed 1860 points. He successfully kicked 36 consecutive goals for Scotland between 11 August 2007 and 7 June 2008, not missing a single attempt during the 2007 Rugby World Cup or the 2008 Six Nations Championship. This run was brought to an end during 7 June 2008 Test against Argentina. This is believed to have been a world record for consecutive successful kicks at goal in Test play since such statistics were first kept in the late 1980s; this record was broken in 2010 by Morn√© Steyn of South Africa. During the aforementioned Argentina match, Paterson also overtook Gavin Hastings' long standing Scotland points record of 667, as well as equalling Scott Murray's record of 87 caps for Scotland. During his playing career he scored 809 points for Scotland (22 Tries, 90 Conversions, 170 Penalties and 3 drop goals).

Aracataca is a river town founded in 1885. The town stands beside the river of the same name, the Aracataca river that flows from the nearby Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range into the Ci√©naga Grande de Santa Marta. Aracataca is located some 80 km south of the Department capital Santa Marta. The town is best known as the birthplace of Nobel literature laureate Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. Geography and climate The municipality borders to the north with the municipalities of Zona Bananera, Santa Marta and Cienaga, to the east with the Cesar Department, to the south with the municipality of Fundaci√≥n, and to the west with the municipalities of El Ret√©n and Pueblo Viejo. Aracataca's climate is tropical: warm and humid year-round. History Aracataca was founded in 1885. It achieved the status of municipality on the 28th of April 1915, when it separated from the municipality of Pueblo Viejo. In the late 19th century, companies that would later merge into the United Fruit Company colonized the land and started to cultivate bananas in the wide region. After some decades, the downfall of the company initiated and completed soon after, partly because of the worldwide recession and the war soon after.

Commerce represents another form of income and is mostly done informally, especially along the main highway to Santa Marta where large lines of stands selling beach towels are placed. Transportation There are several companies that offer inter-municipal and inter-departmental transportation on medium-size buses, minivans and taxi cabs. Most tourists and locals use Berlinas del Fonce which has busses leaving the Santa Marta terminal every 30 minutes between 5am and 6pm. $9.000 p.p.

Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, it is effectively a 'scaled- down' version of Space Hulk and Tyranid Attack, using plastic Marine Scouts from the Ultramarines, Space Wolves, Dark Angels and Blood Angels chapters. Other components include event cards, a simple ruleset, as well as corridor and room tiles from the game Space Hulk. Rules Before the game begins, players arranged the interlocking room and corridor tiles on the playing area to represent a maze (a \\"Space Hulk\\"). Alien Artefact counters are randomly placed throughout the play area. Each player sets up their 5 models in a starting room of their choice and then take turns to move their pieces. The object of the game is to move the various Scout models to retrieve the artefacts and carry them to the starting rooms while stopping opponent models from achieving the same goal. Random event cards are dealt to each player that allows them to either help their own models (in the form of medipacks or double movement) or hinder opponents (by placing obstacles in their path or attacking them directly). Unlike other Games Workshop games, Ultra Marines featured a unique method of determining the accuracy of weapons fire and close combat attacks. The box of the game featured a grid printed on the inside of the lid, and dice were thrown into the lid and the results read from the squares that the dice landed in. However, this led to eventual problems after release as the cardboard box would warp or become worn after years of use and the distortion of the box lid would skew results.

(4 November 1716 L√ºtetsburg, East Frisia ‚Äì 7 December 1800 Kassel) was a German general officer who served in Hesse-Kassel. He fought in the American Revolutionary War, during which he commanded Hessian auxiliaries on behalf of Great Britain. Biography Knyphausen's father was the colonel of a Prussian regiment under the Duke of Marlborough. Educated in Berlin, the young Knyphausen entered the Prussian military service in 1734, and in 1775 he became a general officer in the army of Frederick the Great. In the army of Hesse-Cassel, he was a lieutenant general. In 1776, with 42 years of military experience, he came to the Thirteen Colonies of British North America as second-in-command of an army of 12,000 men called \\"Hessians\\" under General Heister. Knyphausen led the Hessian troops in the Battles of White Plains, Fort Washington, Brandywine, Germantown, Springfield, and Monmouth. In 1779 and 1780, he commanded British-held New York City. When Heister left for Germany, Knyphausen took command of the German troops serving under Sir William Howe. Because of Knyphausen's seniority, British officers held dormant commissions outranking him in case the British commander became disabled. Despite this, Knyphausen was trusted by his British superiors. Knyphausen's regiment took part in the attack on Fort Washington and was in garrison at Trenton, New Jersey. Major von Dechow, who was in command in late 1776, warned Colonel Johann Rall to fortify the town, advice that was ignored. During the Battle of Trenton the regiment tried to escape across Assunpink Creek but was forced to surrender. Dechow was mortally wounded during the battle. Sir William Howe gave Knyphausen responsibility for commanding the right flank at the Brandywine, tasked with keeping the attention of the Continental commanders on the river line at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. He also commanded the vanguard of the army withdrawing from Philadelphia at the time of the Battle of Monmouth. For several years the main body of Knyphausen's force occupied the upper part of Manhattan Island, and during the temporary absence of Sir Henry Clinton in 1780, he was in command of the city. Knyphausen's regiment served in the Americas from 1776 to 1783. Knyphausen left the North American theater in 1782 in part because of ill health, including blindness in one eye caused by a cataract. (His wife had died in 1778.) Friedrich Wilhelm von Lossberg succeeded to command of the Hessian troops in New York. Knyphausen returned to Europe, having, as he said, achieved neither glory nor advancement, but near the end of his life he became military governor of Cassel. He was a taciturn and discreet officer, who understood the temper of his troops and rarely entered on hazardous exploits. His was a hireling army of recruits gathered from work-houses and by impressment, drilled in the use of arms on shipboard. As he frequently declared, on such forces a judicious commander could place little reliance; they dwindled less by death than by desertion. In 1785, shortly after the end of the war, General Lafayette travelled to Cassel and met Knyphausen. He wrote to General Washington that they had reminisced about the war and exchanged compliments. Knyphausen died in 1800 as the result of an eye surgery. Legacy Fort Hill Park in Staten Island, New York is the site of what was once called Fort Knyphausen, an earthen redoubt built to fend off Patriot forces. One of the streets of Glasgow, Delaware is called North General Knyphausen Court.

Selden and the Electric Vehicle Company. Ultimately, the organization took advantage of its power and became Selden's greatest ally. In exchange for favorable royalty rates, the group gained the power to litigate and exclude other manufacturers from licensing, making them the most powerful group in the early automotive industry.  Early history  In 1899, the Electric Vehicle Company purchased the rights to Selden's automobile patent. The patent was deemed flimsy by most of the industry, but the company purchased the rights to guarantee the legality of their new venture, the Columbia Automobile Company. A year later, however, the Columbia Automobile Company was in shambles thanks to internal corruption and low demand for electric vehicles, and the Electric Vehicle Company turned to the Selden patent as an alternative source of revenue. They set out to have manufacturers pay a 5% royalty on all cars produced. By 1900, The Electric Vehicle Company launched several lawsuits against automobile manufacturers. Their ultimate target among the fray was Alexander Winton, and his Winton Motor Carriage Company. Originally formed in 1896, the Winton Company was by 1900 the highest-volume automobile producer in the US. If the patent were to gain validity in the industry, Selden believed, they needed to tackle the largest manufacturer. The Winton Company's defense made the costly mistake of concentrating on challenging the patent‚Äôs validity through demurrer; by 1902 the case was still tied up and Winton was considering a settlement. In response to his distress, other independent automobile makers formed a group called the Manufacturers Mutual Association to breathe new life into Winton's legal defense. Formed by Henry Bourne Joy of Packard and Frederic L. Smith of Olds, the two entrepreneurs used their position to threaten the Electric Vehicle Company. The MMA called for much lower royalty payments and for the legal and license rights to be controlled by the MMA, or else they would bolster Winton's dying legal fund.  Control of the industry  1904 ALAM Advertisement By 1903, the organization had officially become the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, and had secured favorable rights from the Electric Vehicle Company. Only a few months after the formation of the organization, Winton became an ALAM member, and the suit against his company was dropped. The patent had gained legitimacy without ever having its validity determined. The ALAM gained from the agreement, giving them control over the entire automobile industry for a relatively low cost. The group negotiated a 1.25% royalty on all cars produced, one half of one percent of which went directly into the ALAM legal and operations funds. Applications for ALAM membership and a Selden license were granted only by the unanimous decision of a 5-member executive board. This system left ALAM members with royalties considerably lower than the costs of trying the Selden patent in the courts, and gave existing members the ability to exclude and even litigate unlicensed competitors. The ALAM's exclusionary policies were ultimately its undoing. The up-and-coming Ford Motor Company was capitalized in 1903, and Henry Ford immediately attempted to secure a Selden license. He was denied, officially due to his past business failures (the Detroit Automobile Company and the Henry Ford Company, specifically), and also due to the protectionist climate of the ALAM. Frederic Smith of Olds was the executive board member most outspoken against Ford‚Äôs admission to the ALAM, and also had the most to lose from such an admission, as he held most of the Detroit market for mass- produced automobiles. On October 22, 1903, the ALAM filed suit with the Ford Motor Company, and what followed was a messy public relations battle. The ALAM launched a campaign threatening to sue those who purchased Ford automobiles. Ford responded in-kind, summing up their position as, \\"We believe that the art would have been just as far advanced to-day if Mr. Selden had never been born.\\" On September 15, 1909, presiding Judge Hough found legitimacy in the Selden patent. The court of appeals later overturned the ruling, finding in favor of Ford on January 9, 1911. ALAM chose not to contest the ruling.

She was formerly the vocalist for the band Drill and also performed in KMFDM offshoots MDFMK, KGC, and Schwein. Career Cifarelli got her start recording in studios in New York, eventually forming her own band, Drill, along with future Black Label Society bass guitarist John DeServio. Drill released one self-titled album, spawning two music videos and getting a third song featured in the movie Empire Records. Later in 1995, Drill opened for Stabbing Westward's Wither, Blister, Burn, and Peel Tour. The band broke up shortly after the end of the tour. Cifarelli joined the KMFDM-hiatus band MDFMK in 2000. The project lasted for one self-titled album. In 2001, Cifarelli and Sascha Konietzko worked on the supergroup Schwein and its albums Schweinstein and the subsequent remix album Son of Schweinstein. After the MDFMK project was discontinued, Cifarelli was asked to return as a member of KMFDM. She has been a member of the band since 2002's Attak. She recorded one solo album, From the Land of Volcanos. One single off the album, \\"I Will\\", appeared on the American Pie 2 soundtrack. Cifarelli performed on the band KGC's 2006 album Dirty Bomb. Personal life Lucia Cifarelli was raised in Long Island. Her father, Albert V. Cifarelli was a dentist, born in 1937 and raised near Corona, NY and from an Italian- American family. With his late first wife, Barbara, Albert had four children - one son (Charles) and three daughters (Leslie, Karen Joy and Lucia Mia). Paternal grandparents of Lucia are Emily Schiavo and Charles Cifarelli. The eldest sister, Leslie Cifarelli, who was an aspiring actress (Rent Control (1984 film)) died in the early nineties from complications related to HIV. This was unexpected and had a big impact on Lucia‚Äôs life, as she was very close to her big sister. They used to listen to Kate Bush, Stevie Wonder, Roxy Music and David Bowie together when they were children. When Leslie graduated, Lucia was visiting her on weekends and they often danced the night away in Xenon (nightclub), Danceteria, The Tunnel, The Nile or Palladium. According to herself, Cifarelli was an ordinary child and her parents knew she wouldn't pursue a career in science, like her father or uncles. Her only passion was singing. At first she showed no big talent, but determination big enough to overcome it. Leslie encouraged her to keep singing and in her early teens Cifarelli got a job to pay for her singing lessons with vocal coaches like Tania Travers. When her sister was diagnosed with terminal illness, Cifarelli started expressing her inner anger and sorrow in her music, which led her to include various \\"primary growls\\" and screams in her songs. This singing technique was later associated with her, but Lucia never stopped experimenting. In July 2005, she married KMFDM founder and producer Sascha Konietzko. They live in Hamburg, Germany, her husband's hometown. The couple has one daughter (Annabella Asia Konietzko, born February 14, 2008).

M. Cornford and published in 1908. It has acquired a small cult following as a pessimistic view of academic politics presented in a readable and lively style, and is best known for its discussion of such principles as \\"The (Thin End of the) Wedge\\" and \\"The Dangerous Precedent\\": : The Principle of the Wedge is that you should not act justly now for fear of raising expectations that you may act still more justly in the futureexpectations which you are afraid you will not have the courage to satisfy. A little reflection will make it evident that the Wedge argument implies the admission that the persons who use it cannot prove that the action is not just. If they could, that would be the sole and sufficient reason for not doing it, and this argument would be superfluous. : The Principle of the Dangerous Precedent is that you should not now do an admittedly right action for fear you, or your equally timid successors, should not have the courage to do right in some future case, which, ex hypothesi, is essentially different, but superficially resembles the present one. Every public action which is not customary, either is wrong, or, if it is right, is a dangerous precedent. It follows that nothing should ever be done for the first time. The book is also known for Cornford's definition, in the preface to a later edition, of propaganda as: \\"that branch of the art of lying which consists in very nearly deceiving your friends without quite deceiving your enemies\\". Although written for an audience familiar with the procedures of the University of Cambridge at the turn of the twentieth century, it could apply to any political system and is similar to the British television comedy Yes Minister; some of the dialogue in the \\"Doing the Honours\\" episode closely follows its text. Christopher Hitchens quotes several parts and reflects upon this essay in his book Letters to a Young Contrarian, introducing it to the reader by quoting the above Principles of Wedge and Dangerous Precedent. ‚ÄúF.M. Cornford [was] a witty Cambridge academic of the Edwardian period who had become used to every possible High Table euphemism and Senior Common Room obfuscation. He anatomised them all in his 1908 treatise, Microcosmographia Academia. The passage I‚Äôll give you is from chapter 7, entitled ‚ÄúArguments‚Äù: There is only one argument for doing something; the rest arguments for doing nothing. Since the stone-axe fell into disuse at the close of the neolithic age, two other arguments of universal application have been added to the rhetorical armoury by the ingenuity of mankind.

Its chief remains are major earthworks built before 1000 CE by the South Appalachian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture.) These include the Great Temple and other ceremonial mounds, a burial mound, and defensive trenches. They represented highly skilled engineering techniques and soil knowledge, and the organization of many laborers. The site has evidence of \\"17,000 years of continuous human habitation.\\" \\"Ocmulgee National Monument\\", National Park Service, accessed 15 July 2011 The park is located on the east bank of the Ocmulgee River. Present-day Macon, Georgia developed around the site after the United States built Fort Benjamin Hawkins nearby in 1806 to support trading with Native Americans. For thousands of years, succeeding cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples had settled on what is called the Macon Plateau at the Fall Line, where the rolling hills of the Piedmont met the Atlantic coastal plain. The monument designation included the Lamar Mounds and Village Site, located downriver about from Macon. The site was designated for federal protection by the National Park Service (NPS) in 1934, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and redesignated as an national historical park in 2019. National Historical Park While the mounds had been studied by some travelers, professional excavation under the evolving techniques of archeology did not begin until the 1930s, under the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) sponsored large- scale archaeological digs at the site between 1933 and 1942. Workers excavated portions of eight mounds, finding an array of significant archeological artifacts that revealed a wide trading network and complex, sophisticated culture.David Holly, \\"Macon Plateau\\", in Guy E. Gibbon, Ed., Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia, New York: Routledge, 1998, p. 601 On June 14, 1934, the park was authorized by Congress as a national monument and formally established on December 23, 1936 under the National Park Service. As an historic unit of the Park Service, the national monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019, redesignated it as a national historical park. In the early 1990s, the National Park Service renovated its facilities at the park. In 1997, it designated the Ocmulgee National Monument as a Traditional Cultural Property, the first such site named east of the Mississippi River. Ocmulgee's visitor center includes an archaeology museum. It displays artifacts and interprets the successive cultures of the prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited this site as well as the historic Muscogee Creek tribe and diverse peoples of the colonial era. The visitor center includes a short orientation film for the site and a gift shop, with books related to the park. The large park encompasses , and has of walking trails. Near the visitor center is a reconstructed ceremonial earthlodge, based on a 1,000-year-old structure excavated by archeologists. Visitors can reach the Great Temple Mound via a half-mile walk or the park road. Other surviving prehistoric features in the park include a burial mound, platform mounds, and earthwork trenches. The historic site of the English colonial Ocumulgee trading post is also part of the park. The main section of Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park is accessible from U.S. Route 80, off Interstate 16 (which passes through the southwest edge of the park). It is open daily except Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The Lamar Mounds and Village Site is an isolated unit of the park, located in the swamps about south of Macon. The Lamar Site is open on a limited basis. History =Macon Plateau culture= Ocmulgee (pronounced \\"oak-mull-ghee\\") is a memorial to ancient indigenous peoples in Southeastern North America. From Ice Age hunters to the Muscogee Creek tribe of historic times, the site has evidence of 17,000 years of human habitation. The Macon plateau was inhabited during the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Woodland phases. The major occupation was ca. 950-1150 during the Early Mississippian-culture phase. The people of this sophisticated, stratified culture built the complex, massive earthworks that expressed their religious and political system.David J. Holly, \\"Macon Plateau\\", in Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia, p. 601 Archeologists call this society the Macon Plateau culture, a local expression of the Mississippian culture. During this period, an elite society supported by skillful farmers constructed a town. Leaders directed the complex construction of large, earthwork mounds, the central structures on the plateau. Carrying earth by hand in bags, thousands of workers built the .-high Great Temple Mound on a high bluff overlooking the floodplain of the Ocmulgee River. Magnetometer scans have revealed the platform mound had a spiraling staircase oriented toward the floodplain. The staircase is unique among any of the Mississippian-culture sites. Other earthworks include at least one burial mound. The people built rectangular wooden buildings to house certain religious ceremonies on the top of the platform mounds. The mounds at Ocmulgee were unusual because they were constructed further from each other than was typical of other Mississippian complexes. Scholars believe this was to provide for public space and residences around the mounds. Circular earth lodges were built to serve as places to conduct meetings and important ceremonies. Remains of one of the earth lodges were carbon dated to 1050 CE. This evidence was the basis for the reconstructed lodge which archeologists later built at the park center. The interior features a raised-earth platform, shaped like an eagle with a forked- eye motif. Molded seats on the platform were built for the leaders. The eagle was a symbol of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, which the people shared with other Mississippian cultures. = Lamar Period = As the Mississippian culture declined at the ceremonial center, ca. 1350 a new culture coalesced among people who lived in the swamps downstream. The Late Mississippian period (1350 - 1600 A.D.), also consisted of the Lamar Period, where natives built two mounds that have survived, including a unique spiral mound. The Lamar period is composed of four distinct phases that lasted between the years 1375 and 1670, is identified through unique ceramic design elements that was majorly implemented during the phase it is associated with. These phases includes the Duvall, Iron Horse, Dyar and Bell phases. They also had a village, which they protected by a constructed defensive palisade constructed of logs. Their rectangular homes with roofs made of thatch or sod and clay plastered walls were positioned around the mounds. This former settlement is now protected as the Lamar Mounds and Village Site.\\"Ocmulgee National Monument\\", National Park Service Lamar pottery was distinctive, stamped with complex designs like the pottery of the earlier Woodland peoples. It was unlike the pottery of the Macon Plateau culture. Many archaeologists believe the Lamar culture was related to the earlier Woodland inhabitants, who, after being displaced by the newer Mississippian culture migrants, developed a hybrid culture. Late Woodland Period characteristics extended into the Mississippian Period of 800 A.D. to 1600 A.D. =Spanish contact= In 1540 the expedition of Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto recorded its travel through the chiefdom of Ichisi. Historians and archeologists believe this was likely what is now known as the Lamar site.\\"Hernando de Soto\\", National Park Service The Spaniards left a trail of destruction in their wake as they wandered throughout the present-day Southeastern U.S. in a failed search for precious metals. Their deadliest legacy was likely related to the pigs they brought. Escaping, the pigs became feral and spread Eurasian infectious diseases. As the American Indians had no acquired immunity to these new diseases, they suffered high fatalities. The rate of deaths caused social dislocations and likely contributed to a collapse of the Mississippian cultures.Charles C. Mann, 1491: New Revelations on the Americas Before Columbus, pp. 107-110 In the aftermath of De Soto's expedition, the Mississippian cultures disappeared. Hierarchical chiefdoms crumbled. They were replaced by loose confederacies of clans. The clans did not produce the agricultural surpluses of the previous society, which had supported the former population density and development of complex culture. Agriculture had enabled the development of hierarchy in the larger population. Its leaders planned and directed the corv√©e labor system that raised and maintained the great earthen mounds. The culture supported artisans as well. =Colonial era= By the late 18th century, the largest Native American confederacy in present-day Georgia and Alabama was the Muscogee (known during the colonial and federal periods as the Muscogee Creek tribe), part of the Muskogean-speaking peoples. They considered the ancient Mississippian mounds at Ocmulgee to be sacred and made pilgrimages there. According to Muscogee oral tradition, the mounds area was \\"the place where we first sat down\\", after their ancestors ended their migration journey from the West. In 1690, Scottish fur traders from Carolina built a trading post on Ochese Creek (Ocmulgee River), near the Macon Plateau mounds. Some Muscogee settled nearby, developing a village along the Ocmulgee River near the post, where they could easily acquire trade goods. They defied efforts by Spanish Florida authorities to bring them into the mission province of Apalachee.\\"Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects ... Ocmulgee National Monument,\\", Federal Register Notice, National Park Service The traders referred to both the river and the peoples living along it as \\"Ochese Creek.\\" Later usage shortened the term to Creek, which traders and colonists applied to all Muskogean-speaking peoples. The Muscogee called their village near the trading-post Ocmulgee (bubbling waters) in the local Hitchiti language. The British colonists called it Ocmulgee Town, which was later the basis of their naming the river. The Muscogee traded pelts of white tailed deer and Native American slaves captured in raids against other tribes. They received West Indian rum, cloth, glass beads, hatchets, swords, and flintlock rifles. Carolinian fur traders, who were men of capital, took Muscogee wives, often the daughters of chiefs. It was a practice common also among the British fur traders in Canada; both the fur traders and Aboriginal Canadians saw such marriages as a way to increase the alliances among the elite of both cultures. The fur traders encouraged the Muscogee slaving raids against Spanish \\"Mission Indians.\\" British colonists were so few in number that they depended on Native American alliances for security and survival. In 1702 South Carolina Governor Col. James Moore raised a militia of 50 colonists and 1,000 Yamasee and Ochese Creek warriors. From 1704 to 1706, they attacked and destroyed a significant number of Spanish missions of coastal Georgia and Florida. They captured numerous Mission tribes: the Timucua and Apalachee, some of whom the colonists and their Indian allies sold into slavery. Together with extensive fatalities from infectious disease epidemics, the warfare caused Florida's indigenous population to fall from about 16,000 in 1685 to 3,700 by 1715.Alan Taylor, American Colonies: The Settling of North America, New York: Penguin Books: 2001, p. 233 As Florida was depopulated, the English-allied tribes grew indebted to slave traders. They paid other tribes to attack and enslave Native Americans, raids that were a catalyst for the Yamasee War in 1715. In an effort to drive the colonists out, the Ochese Creek joined the rebellion and burned the Ocmulgee trading post. In retaliation, South Carolina began arming the Cherokee, whose attacks forced the Ochese Creek to abandon the Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers, and move west to the Chattahoochee River. The Yamasee took refuge in Spanish Florida. With the defeat of the Yamasee, the English created the new colony of Georgia, founding Savannah on the coast in 1733. Although various development schemes were attempted (silkworm cultivation, production of naval stores), the colony did not become profitable until after Georgia ended its prohibition of slavery. The founders had intended to provide a colony for hardworking English laborers, but not enough were willing to bear its hard conditions. The colony began to import African slaves as laborers and to develop the labor-intensive rice, cotton and indigo plantations in the 1750s in the Low Country. These commodity crops, based on slave labor, made the wealth of the planter elite of South Carolina. Because of continuing conflicts with land-hungry European settlers and other Muscogee groups, many Ochese Creek migrated from Georgia to Spanish Florida in the 18th century. There they joined with earlier refugees of the Yamasee War, remnants of Mission Indians, and escaped African slaves, to form a new tribe which became known as the Seminole. = Relations with the United States = The Ocmulgee mounds evoked awe in eighteenth-century travelers. The Naturalist William Bartram journeyed through Ocmulgee in 1774 and 1776. He described the \\"wonderful remains of the power and grandeur of the ancients in this part of America.\\"\\"Ocmulgee National Monument\\", Colonial History, National Park Service Bartram was the first to record the Muscogee oral histories of the mounds' origins. The Lower Creek of Georgia initially had good relations with the federal government of the United States, based on the diplomacy of both Benjamin Hawkins, President George Washington's Indian agent, and the Muscogee Principal Chief Alexander McGillivray. McGillivray was the son of Sehoy, a Muscogee woman of the Wind Clan, and Lachlan McGillivray, a wealthy Scottish fur trader. He achieved influence both within the matrilineal tribe, because of the status of his mother's family, and among the Americans because of his father's position and wealth. He secured U.S. recognition of Muscogee and Seminole sovereignty by the Treaty of New York (1790). But, after the invention of the cotton gin in 1794 made cultivation of short-staple cotton more profitable, Georgians were eager to acquire Muscogee corn-fields of the uplands area to develop as cotton plantations; they began to encroach on the native territory. Under government pressure in 1805, the Lower Creeks ceded their lands east of the Ocmulgee River to the state of Georgia, but they refused to surrender the sacred mounds. They retained a 3√ó5-mile-square area on the east bank called the Ocmulgee Old Fields Reserve. It included both the mounds on the Macon Plateau and the Lamar mounds. In 1806 the Jefferson administration ordered Fort Benjamin Hawkins to be built on a hill overlooking the mounds. The fort was of national and state military importance through 1821, used as a US Army command headquarters, and a supply depot for campaigns in the War of 1812 and later. Economically, it was important as a trading post or factory to regulate the Creek Nation's trade in deerskins. In addition, it served as a headquarters and mustering area for the Georgia state militia. It thus served as a point of contact among the Creek Nation, the US, and the state of Georgia military and political representatives.Daniel T. Elliott, Fort Hawkins: 2005-2007 Field Seasons , The LAMAR Institute, Report 124, 2008, p. 1, accessed 16 July 2011 Tensions among the Upper Creek and Lower Creek towns increased with encroachment by European- American settlers in Georgia. Many among the Upper Creek wanted to revive traditional culture and religion, and a young group of men, the Red Sticks, formed around their prophets. The US and Georgia forces used the fort as a base during the Creek War of 1813‚Äì1814. At the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, General Andrew Jackson defeated the Red Stick faction of the Upper Creek. Together with their own issues, the Red Sticks had been influenced by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and were seeking to drive the Americans out of their territory. The Lower Creek fought alongside the U.S. against the Red Sticks. Led by Chief William McIntosh, the Lower Creek also allied with the United States in the First Seminole War. McIntosh's influence in the area was extended by his family ties to Georgia's planter elite through his wealthy Scots father of the same name. McIntosh was connected to the McGillivray clan. A resident of Savannah, the senior McIntosh had strong ties to the British and had been a Tory officer during the American Revolution. He tried to recruit the Lower Creek to fight for the British in the war. Remaining in the new United States after the war, he became a cotton planter. In 1819, the Lower Creek gathered for the last time at the Ocmulgee Old Fields. In 1821, Chief McIntosh agreed to the first Treaty of Indian Springs, by which the Lower Creek ceded their lands east of the Flint River, including the Ocmulgee Old Fields, to the United States. In 1822 the state chartered Bibb County, and the following year the town of Macon was founded. The Creek National Council struggled to end such land cessions by making them a capital offense. But in 1825, Chief McIntosh and his paternal cousin, Georgia Governor George Troup, negotiated an agreement with the US. McIntosh and several other Lower Creek chiefs signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs in 1825. McIntosh ceded the remaining Lower Creek lands to the United States, and the Senate ratified the treaty by one vote, despite its lacking the signature of Muscogee Principal Chief William McIntosh. Soon after that, the chief Menama and 200 warriors attacked McIntosh's plantation. They killed him and burned down his mansion in retaliation for his alienating the communal lands. William McIntosh and a Muscogee delegation from the National Council went to Washington to protest the treaty to President John Quincy Adams. The US government and the Creek negotiated a new treaty, called the Treaty of New York (1826), but the Georgia state government proceeded with evicting Creek from lands under the 1825 treaty. It also passed laws dissolving tribal government and regulating residency on American Indian lands. In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president. He supported Indian removal, signing legislation to that effect by Congress in 1830. Later he used US Army forces to remove the remnants of the Southeastern Indian tribes through the 1830s. The Creek, the Cherokee, the Choctaw, the Chickasaw and most of the Seminole, known as the Five Civilized Tribes, were all removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Following Indian Removal, the Muscogee reorganized in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). In 1867 they founded a new capital, which they called Okmulgee in honor of their sacred mounds on the plateau of the Georgia fall line.\\"Muscogee\\" , Oklahoma History and Culture Images Image:15 30 096 ocmulgee.jpgpark entrance sign Image:OcmulTempMnd.JPGLooking upward to the Great Temple Mound from the bluff above the Ocmulgee River Image:15_30_161_ocmulgee.jpgview from top of Great Temple Mound Image:OcmulgeeLargeMound.jpgThe Great Temple Mound Image:17_19_001_ocmulgee.jpgmap on display at Fort Hawkins = Archaeology Museum = Image:OcmulgeeCeramics.JPGPipes, necklaces, and a pottery vessel with a lid the shape of a human head, found at Ocmulgee Image:OcmulgeeRaid.JPGCol.

It was formerly known as the \\"Florida State Prison-East Unit\\" as it was originally part of Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida (now known as Union Correctional Institution). The facility, a part of the Florida Department of Corrections, is located on State Road 16 right across the border from Union County. The institution opened in 1961, even though construction was not completed until 1968. With a maximum population of over 1,400 inmates, FSP is one of the largest prisons in the state. FSP houses one of the state's three death row cell blocks, and the state's execution chamber. Union Correctional Institution also houses male death row inmates while Lowell Annex houses female death row inmates. Lethal injection became the standard method of execution in 2000. The electric chair can still be used by request of the inmate. FSP sits in the center of several other prisons. It is surrounded by New River Correctional Institution, New River O-Unit, FSP West Unit, and sits across the river from Union Correctional Institution. Even though Union Correctional Institution is on the same property, immediately north-west of FSP, the county line (with Union County) runs in between the two, which makes Raiford the United States Postal Service address city of Union Correctional Institution, while Starke is the USPS address city of Florida State Prison. FSP is Florida's only prison that is officially named \\"prison\\", with the other institutions being named \\"Correctional Institutions\\" (or \\"Correctional Facility\\" if it is a privately contracted prison).

Despite being relatively obsolete on the Norwegian musical scene, it is an important part of the creation of Kaizers Orchestra.  History  After Ottesen and Zahl's previous band, Blod Sn√•tt & Juling, dissolved, Janove joined the army, where he wrote some songs that were recorded on a demo (known to fans as Janoves Soloprosjekt). Some of these songs wound up being recorded on the acoustic demo for the new band Janove and Geir started when they were together again, namely, gnom. Janove and Geir were soon joined by Helge Risa on pump organ, and Rune Solheim on drums (the two would later continue on as members of Kaizers Orchestra) and Rolf Prest√∏, known as \\"Bestefar\\", (grandpa) on bass. gnom's first, and only, release was Mys (1997), of which there were made 1000 copies, less than half of which were sold in the first year of its release. The band had to struggle to obtain any performance spots, and if one was available, the spectators were about 20, average. However, after the release of Mys, Janove wrote a song called \\"Bastard\\", which had a very Tom Waits-esque sound to it, and for which the band utilized oil barrels as percussion. However, the band quickly began to dissolve due to lack of gigs and success. However, Ottesen decided to write songs in the same vein as \\"Bastard\\", and as a result, he and Geir created a new band, known as Kaizers Orchestra.

For decades Eaton was one of the most powerful financiers in the American Midwest, and he was a colourful and often-controversial figure. He was chiefly known for his longevity in business, for his opposition to the dominance of eastern financiers in the America of his day, for his occasionally ruthless financial manipulations, for his passion for world peace and for his outspoken criticism of United States Cold War policy. He funded and helped organize the first Pugwash Conferences on World Peace, in 1957. He wrote numerous articles and essays on political and economic subjects‚Äî\\"Investment Banking\\", \\"Competition or Decadence\\", \\"Rationalism Versus Rockefeller\\", and \\"A Capitalist Looks at Labour\\" being some of the best known.http://speeches.empireclub.org/60606/data Life and career Eaton was born on December 27, 1883 on a farm near the village of Pugwash in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Besides farming, his father, Joseph Howe Eaton, ran a small general store and the district post office. Cyrus' uncle was Charles Aubrey Eaton. Eaton left Nova Scotia in 1899 to attend Woodstock College, a Baptist-affiliated prep school in Woodstock, Ontario. Later he enrolled at McMaster University, a Baptist university, then located in Toronto, where he studied philosophy and finance, intending to enter the Baptist ministry. He earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1905 with a major in philosophy.Eaton biography Cyrus Eaton in Leipzig, Germany (June 1960) After graduating from McMaster he moved to Cleveland and went to work for the East Ohio Gas Company. This was one of many businesses associated with John D. Rockefeller. After working with East Ohio Gas and Rockefeller for two years, he established his own business in 1907, developing gas utilities which at the time were relatively underdeveloped and unconsolidated in Canada. He managed to secure natural-gas franchises in Manitoba, Canada representing a group of New York investors. The syndicate was not able to complete its financing and folded. However, the Manitoba government was sufficiently impressed to allow Eaton to retain the franchises. Eaton formed a new holding company, the Canada Gas & Electric Corp, later consolidated into the Continental Gas & Electric Corp. in 1913. After spending several years traveling, Eaton settled in Cleveland in 1913 and became active in many businesses. Eaton joined the Otis & Co. banking firm in 1916. In 1926 he set up an investment vehicle organized as Continental Shares, Inc., a closed end trust. In 1927 he formed Republic Steel, the 3rd-largest U.S. steel company. His business had a complex structure which some felt to be too highly leveraged. His 1929 wealth was an estimated $100 million, most of which was lost in the Great Depression. Eaton rebuilt his fortune in the 1940s and 1950s, becoming a director (1943), then board chairman (1954), of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway; and also board chairman of the West Kentucky Coal Co. (1953).http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=ECS1 He died on May 9, 1979 at his home, Acadia Farm, in Northfield, OH.

The Russell‚ÄìEinstein Manifesto was issued in London on July 9, 1955 by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War. It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven preeminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist Eaton offered to sponsor a conference‚Äîcalled for in the manifesto‚Äîin Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957. Besides financial support for the Pugwash Conferences, Eaton gave money to support education in Nova Scotia, particularly in Pugwash and to Acadia University. He supported the establishment of a game sanctuary in Nova Scotia on the Aspotogan Peninsula (his summer home was in Blandford, Nova Scotia where he had his ashes buried. He donated money for the doors of St. Bartholmus Church in Blandford and 12 acres (4.9 hectares) of land in Northfield, Ohio, for the Lee Eaton Elementary School, named in memory of his daughter. He was also a financial supporter of McMaster University, the YWCA, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and Case Western Reserve University.

Roscoe Sweeney was portrayed by Kevin Nagle in the Netflix series Daredevil set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history The first Marvel Comics character known as the Fixer was Roscoe Sweeney. He first appeared in Daredevil #1 (Apr. 1964), and was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Bill Everett. The second iteration of Fixer was long-time supervillain Paul Norbert Ebersol, first appearing in Strange Tales #141 (February 1966) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Much later, he appeared as a regular character in Thunderbolts, until he was forced to leave the team. Fictional character biography =Roscoe Sweeney= Roscoe Sweeney was a gangster and crooked fight promoter who was involved in extortion and illegal gambling who operated as the \\"Fixer\\". He paid boxer \\"Battling Jack\\" Murdock to take a fall and lose a fight. Murdock accepted the money, however, the boxer became determined to continue the fight and eventually won by a knockout. The Fixer's right-hand man Slade killed Jack after the fight in retaliation. Learning of his father's murder and vowing to bring men like the Fixer to justice, Matt Murdock became a lawyer as well as the superhero Daredevil to do so. Fixer and Slade went to Fogwell's Gym where they encountered the Daredevil. When Fixer and Slade ran for it upon their being disarmed, the Daredevil pursued them into the subway station. After the Man Without Fear tripped Slade, the Fixer had a fatal heart attack when confronted by the Daredevil and died. As Fixer's body fell onto the subway tracks, the Man Without Fear stopped a subway from running over Fixer's body. Slade was arrested and sentenced to death by the electric chair.Daredevil #1 =Paul Norbert Ebersol= Paul Norbert Ebersol was born in Dayton, Ohio. He was a scientist who held a number of odd jobs, including auto mechanic, television repairman, and electronics laboratory assistant. He then became the second and more prominent \\"Fixer\\", a supervillain and genius-level criminal inventor who has often worked for criminal cartels like HYDRA. In his first appearance, he escaped from prison,Strange Tales #141 teamed with his partner Mentallo in an attempted takeover of the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, and even captured Nick Fury.Strange Tales #142 Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. troops.Strange Tales #143 His connection with THEM was revealed; and THEM was later revealed as part of HYDRA.Strange Tales #145 Behind the scenes, he was even revealed as the chief of the HYDRA Science Division.Daredevil #121 With Mentallo, the Fixer later escaped prison again. They invaded the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and captured the Thing. They then invaded the Baxter Building, battled the Thing and Nick Fury, and used Doctor Doom's time machine to bring Deathlok from his alternate future.Marvel Two-in-One #26 Mentallo then mind-controlled Deathlok in an attempted assassination of the U.S. President, but Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by the Fantastic Four and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.Marvel Two-in-One #27 The pair was freed from prison by a HYDRA force controlled by Baron Karza.

When the Masters of Evil invaded Avengers Mansion, Fixer created a device enabling Baron Zemo to control Blackout. Fixer helped engineer the capture of Captain America, Black Knight, and Edwin Jarvis.Avengers #273-274 Fixer was apprehended by Ant- Man. Behind the scenes, Fixer was overpowered by the Super-Adaptoid which changed places with him.Avengers #276 The Super-Adaptoid disguised as the Fixer later escaped prison.Avengers #286 The real Fixer was discovered by the Avengers in the android's former confinement tube at Avengers Island.Avengers #287 Fixer later escaped prison with Yellowjacket who then spurned his romantic advances. The Fixer followed Yellowjacket and battled Yellowjacket and the Black Knight before escaping.Solo Avengers #12 In Zemo's second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, the team changed their identity to the Thunderbolts, while Fixer adopted the alias of Techno. He was then apparently killed when his neck was broken by Iron, one of the Elements of Doom, and he transferred his mind into a robotic body, and this Techno sided, alone among the Thunderbolts, with Zemo when he went ahead with his scheme to conquer the planet. Zemo and Techno decamped to one of Zemo's bases, where Techno began to experiment with cloning, offering to clone Zemo an unscarred body, and even cloning Kevin Costner for fun at one point. After the two fell out, Techno infiltrated the Thunderbolts by replacing Ogre, while continuing his experiments behind-the-scenes, including recovering Jolt's body when she was killed and placing it in a healing tube. Techno's impersonation of Ogre ended when Scourge of the Underworld stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his body from the inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again to allow him to construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body‚Äîmostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage‚Äîand the human Ebersol, initially amnesiac of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer. Fixer then became one of the Redeemers, a government-backed team whereby criminals could use it to accelerate their sentences and clear their record, until most of that team was slaughtered by Graviton. He joined with the reunited Thunderbolts to stop Graviton, and he was one of the team members exiled to Counter-Earth. By a complicated series of events, at the end of the trip to Counter-Earth, Zemo's consciousness ended up in Fixer's tech- pac. By threatening to disable it and leave him quadriplegic, Zemo managed to force Fixer to transfer the Baron's consciousness to his Counter-Earth counterpart's body. The team remained on Counter-Earth for some time, until, in sealing a rift, they returned home, leaving Jolt (whom Fixer saved from burning out in helping to seal the rift) behind. Finally, after Moonstone went insane, Fixer furnished a device that could give the combined Avengers and Thunderbolts a couple of seconds to make their move; he then left. Later, Deadpool visited Fixer at his holiday home to enlist his help in saving Cable. After a brief fight, Fixer accepted the challenge (and Deadpool's monetary inducement), and successfully bonded new, benign, techno-organic mesh to Cable. Some time after this, Fixer suddenly reappeared to save his former teammate MACH-IV from a fall. Fixer recruited MACH-IV to join a secretive group headed by Zemo to combat and destroy Genis-Vell, a member of the Thunderbolts whom Zemo had brought back to life. The process was flawed, however, and Genis' existence now threatened the universe. After Genis was destroyed, Fixer remained with the Thunderbolts, who were now helmed by Zemo. He helped the team recruit supervillains to the pro-registration cause during the Civil War. He also helped Zemo save the Wellspring of Power from the Grandmaster. After Zemo was betrayed and the Thunderbolts were placed under S.H.I.E.L.D. control, Fixer and MACH-IV were offered jobs with the Commission on Superhuman Activities. Ebersol has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book.Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map During the Heroic Age storyline, Fixer works as the Raft's supervisor in its section for male supervillains when Captain Steve Rogers and Luke Cage arrive to recruit Ghost.Thunderbolts #144 As well as working with the Thunderbolts, Fixer has also been seen working with Baron Zemo.Captain America #606 During the Fear Itself storyline, Fixer was seen working on a forcefield to secure the rounded up prisoners that escaped from the Raft after Juggernaut, in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, leveled it.Thunderbolts #159 After escaping the Raft by time-traveling, the Thunderbolts wound up meeting their counterparts - the first Thunderbolts team.Thunderbolts #170 Being as arrogant as they are, present-Fixer and past- Fixer got into an argument in which Fixer impulsively killed his past self.Thunderbolts #173 In order to preserve the timeline, Fixer surgically changed himself to restore his younger appearance and preserved his age by a blood-transfusion from Centurius. Fixer and the past Thunderbolts' memories were wiped, stranding Fixer in a stable time-loop and preserving the timeline after his mistake.Thunderbolts #174 During the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, Fixer resurfaces where is shown to be a prisoner of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-established gated community Pleasant Hill where Kobik, fragments of a Cosmic Cube transformed into a nigh-omnipotent child, turned him into a mild-mannered mechanic named Phil. Phil was able to see through this and arranged a meet-up with a man named Jim. Upon showing the training video he stole that featured the details about Pleasant Hill by Mayor Maria Hill to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Cadets, Phil used a machine he invented to turn himself back into Fixer and Jim back into Baron Helmut Zemo. Both of them vowed to use the device on the other brainwashed supervillains and reduce Pleasant Hill to dust.Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill #1 Fixer and Baron Zemo began to restore the memories of the other inmates one by one.Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1 Fixer later invented a device that would help Baron Zemo and his fellow villains find Kobik.Captain America: Sam Wilson #8 Following the Pleasant Hill incident, Fixer joined up with Winter Soldier's incarnation of the Thunderbolts with the goal to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. from continuing the Kobik Project.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #1 At the time when Baron Zemo formed the third incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Fixer joined the Thunderbolts into fighting them which ends with the Thunderbolts being defeated.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #10 During the \\"Opening Salvo\\" part of the Secret Empire storyline, Fixer defected to the Masters of Evil after Winter Soldier was sent back in time to World War II and Kobik had shattered. While Atlas and Moonstone worked to gather Kobik's pieces, Fixer maintained the inventory of the pieces he has with Erik Selvig. Fixer was later present when Baron Helmut Zemo is advised by the Kobik-reprogrammed Captain America into having the Masters of Evil be part of the Army of Evil.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #12 Powers and abilities The second version of Fixer is an intuitive genius at invention of weapons and other electrical and mechanical devices. He has designed numerous devices and paraphernalia for himself, including his body armor. As weaponry, he has used various devices including bombs, electronic jamming devices, guided missiles, sonic amplifiers, brain-wave scanners, and mind-control pods. He has also built anti-gravity discs which are affixed to his feet and allow flight at the speed of sound, as well as a special mask which contains a three-hour air supply and acts as an air pressure reduction valve, together enabling flight at high velocity and high altitude. Fixer's Techno body can mentally control his robotic body which is capable of assuming virtually any form from blast cannons to pile-drivers to even the form of a space station. To take on larger shapes, Techno physically absorbed the mass of other mechanical materials nearby into himself. Techno's body also could morph into forms that appeared completely organic, as with his assumed guise of Thunderbolt machine-smith Ogre. In other media =Television= * A version of Paul Norbert Ebersol, as Mr. Fix, appears in the Iron Man: Armored Adventures animated series, voiced by Donny Lucas. This version is a genius inventor and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the Maggia. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. Introduced in the episode \\"Whiplash\\", Mr. Fix orders the eponymous villain to kill Pepper Potts‚Äô FBI agent father before he can apprehend him. However, Iron Man defeats Whiplash before he can succeed. In \\"Man and Iron Man\\", Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge on Iron Man, but is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In \\"Don‚Äôt Worry, Be Happy\\", Mr. Fix hires Unicorn and Killer Shrike to commit a robbery, though he secretly equips them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city in an attempt to eliminate them. In the second season two-part opener \\"The Invincible Iron Man\\", Mr. Fix and Whiplash are hired by a mysterious employer to kidnap Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer, but Iron Man intervenes and Mr. Fix escapes. Following this, he discovers his employer is Hammer, who implants Mr. Fix with a nano-virus to ensure his complicity. In \\"Look Into the Light\\" and \\"Titanium vs. Iron\\", Mr. Fix assists Hammer in building the Titanium Man armor. However, Hammer grows impatient with Mr. Fix's efforts to finish the armor's Vibranium-titanium alloy and activates his nano-virus, killing Mr. Fix's physical body and turning his consciousness into an artificial intelligence he calls \\"Mr. Fix 2.0\\" so he can work on Hammer's projects to the exclusion of all else. Unbeknownst to Hammer, Mr. Fix secretly plotted revenge against him. In \\"Hostile Takeover\\", Mr. Fix attempts to \\"dissect\\" Iron Man while his armor was in lockdown mode, but Unicorn and Killer Shrike accidentally recharge the hero's armor and the \\"operation\\" is interrupted by Pepper Potts using Iron Man's stealth armor. In \\"The Hammer Falls\\", Mr. Fix creates a \\"zombification gas\\" while Hammer grows increasingly paranoid over someone blackmailing him. After his criminal activities are exposed, Mr. Fix reveals himself as the blackmailer along with his revenge scheme before using the zombification gas on Hammer. In an attempt to save Hammer, Iron Man blasts Mr. Fix's console, destroying him. * The Paul Norbert Ebersol version of Fixer appears in the anime series Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers. * Roscoe Sweeney appears in the live-action Netflix TV series Daredevil, portrayed by Kevin Nagle. As in the comics, he has Jack Murdock killed when the boxer refused to take a dive in one of his matches. Following Jack's death, Sweeney hid out in another country under the alias \\"Al Marino\\". In the episode \\"Kinbaku\\", Sweeney returns to his house, where he is subdued by Elektra so Matt Murdock can exact revenge. Matt severely beats Roscoe, but refuses to kill him. Instead, he turns him over to the police, much to Elektra's disappointment. * Paul Norbert Ebersol appears in the Avengers: Ultron Revolution animated series, voiced by Rick D. Wasserman. This version is a former worker at Stark Industries until he was fired for giving away company secrets. He first appears as Fixer in the episode \\"Under Siege\\" as a member of the Masters of Evil due to his hatred for Iron Man. He later appears as Techno in the episodes \\"Thunderbolts\\" and \\"Thunderbolts Revealed\\" as a member of the eponymous team. =Film= * The Roscoe Sweeney version of Fixer (renamed Falon) appears in the film Daredevil, portrayed by Mark Margolis. He previously employed Wilson Fisk as an enforcer. =Video games= * The Paul Norbert Ebersol version of Fixer appears as a boss in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance.

In past decades it has also been known as the ‚Äúcucumber mullet‚Äù or ‚Äúcucumber herring,‚Äù for its cucumber-like odour. Description and diet The Australian grayling is a streamlined fish with a long and slender body and small conical head. Colouration is usually silver on the flanks and dusky olive on the back, overlain with a gold sheen. Australian grayling commonly live for 2‚Äì3 years and reach around 20 cm in length, although rare individuals have been recorded up to 5 years in age and 33 cm in length. The fish has an omnivorous diet, feeding upon algae, shrimp, and small insects. They have specially adapted teeth and a long gut to help with the digestion of algae. Reproduction Australian grayling spawn in the freshwater reaches of coastal rivers. Spawning is thought to occur in late autumn or early winter. McDowall (1996) reports that egg counts range from 25,000 to 67,000 in females 170‚Äì200 mm long, and that the small (~1 mm) demersal eggs probably settle among gravel and cobble in the river bed before hatching. Hatched larvae are washed out to sea. Australian grayling juveniles return to the freshwater reaches of rivers after roughly 6 months at sea and spend the rest of their lives in river habitats. Angling Before the introduction of exotic fish species including the Eastern mosquitofish and trout to Australian waterways the Australian grayling and spotted galaxias were keenly fished by recreational anglers using fly-fishing gear. The species was appreciated for its willingness to take wet and dry flies, its excellent fighting ability on very light tackle, and its relatively large size. However, due to declining numbers the fish is now protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Heavy penalties apply for taking any of the fish. Historical declines and current threats Australian grayling suffered massive initial declines in 1869‚Äì70 by very large, unexplained fish kills (Saville-Kent, 1888). Descriptions of grayling killed in this event of being covered in \\"cottony growths\\" suggests a fungal pathogen, possibly marking the arrival of exotic Saprolegnia fungus into Australian freshwater habitats thanks to the reckless importation of exotic salmonid species. > Saville-Kent then went on to consider the apparent epidemic some 17‚Äì18 years > previously which had caused the demise of the Australian grayling > Prototroctes maraena. The grayling were said to \\"have been seen floating > down the rivers in thousands, covered more or less extensively with a > cottony fungoid growth. So virulent and exhaustive was this epidemic that > many, more especially of the southern rivers, were more or less completely > denuded of their stock of this species and have so remained up to the > present date\\". Saville-Kent posed the questions of how, when and where the > epidemic originated and whether at the time there were any abnormal > conditions associated with the rivers carrying the infected fish. He went on > to say: \\"The approximate date of the appearance of this epidemic would > appear to be about the year 1869 or 1870, periods it may be remarked of > great activity in association with the distribution of the fry of the newly > acclimatised Salmonidae in the rivers of this colony. Is it possible ...that > the fungus, ‚Äò‚ÄôSaprolegnia‚Äô‚Äô, was hitherto unknown to Tasmania and was > introduced with the ova of these Salmonidae, or more probably in the moss > wherein they were packed? Under such conditions the germs or spores, like > the microbes of measles or smallpox, arriving on a virgin and congenial > soil, might be expected to spread with devastating virulence among the > aboriginal inhabitants.\\"Cadwallader, P.L. (1996) Today Australian grayling are threatened by a number of things. Dams and weirs block migration and also block floods and reduce base flows, both of which are important for habitat maintenance and for spawning and movement of grayling larvae and juveniles to and from the sea. Irresponsible forestry and farming practices degrade and fragment river environments through siltation and other effects. Exotic trout species threaten grayling through predation and competition. Scientific studies have shown native fish species similar in habitat and lifestyle such as spotted galaxias are severely depressed in number in rivers inhabited by exotic trout species (Ault & White, 1994), and are forced into sub-optimal feeding locations, feeding times and diets by aggressive competition from exotic trout species (McDowall, 2006). A chronic lack of exotic-trout-free habitat reserved for galaxias species and other native fish species in south-eastern Australia generally is a major concern. Australian grayling are listed as a vulnerable species under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and under the IUCN Red List. There are now a number of conservation measures focused on conserving the fish. References Further reading * Ault, T.R. and White, R.W.G.

Since 2016, O'Brien has been the host for Matter of Fact with Soledad O'Brien, a nationally syndicated weekly talk show produced by Hearst Television. She is chairwoman of Starfish Media Group, a multi-platform media production company and distributor that she founded in 2013. She is also a member of the Peabody Awards board of directors, which is presented by the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. O'Brien co-anchored CNN's American Morning from 2003 to 2007, and was the anchor of CNN's morning news program Starting Point from 2012 to 2013. In 2013, O'Brien became special correspondent on the Al Jazeera America news program, America Tonight, and is also a correspondent on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.  Early life and education  O'Brien was born and raised in St. James, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island to Edward Ephrem O'Brien (d. 2019), a mechanical engineering professor at Stony Brook University, and Estela O'Brien (n√©e Marquetti y Mendieta) (d. 2019), a French and English teacher at Smithtown High School West. Her parents were both immigrants and met while they were students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Her father is from Toowoomba, Queensland, in Australia and is of three quarters Irish and one quarter Scottish descent. O'Brien's mother is from Havana, Cuba, and is of Afro-Cuban descent. When she was 14 years old, she came to the United States, sponsored by Oblate Sisters of Providence of Maryland. Interracial marriage was illegal in Maryland before 1967, so in 1958 O'Brien's parents married in Washington, D.C., where marriage laws were less restrictive. The newly wedded O'Briens then moved to Long Island, to the town of St. James. O'Brien is the fifth of six children, all graduates of Harvard College. Her siblings are law professor Maria Hylton (born 1960), GE corporate lawyer Cecilia Vega (born 1961), businessman Tony O'Brien (born 1962), who heads a documents company, eye surgeon Estela Ogiste (born 1964), and anesthesiologist Orestes O'Brien (born 1967). O'Brien graduated from Smithtown High School East in 1984. She attended Radcliffe College from 1984 to 1988, starting as pre-med and English and American literature, but left to take a job at WBZ-TV. O'Brien went back to school while pregnant with her first child and received her degree from Harvard in English and American Literature in 2000.  Career  O'Brien started her career in journalism as a medical reporter on WXKS-FM in Boston because of her background as a pre-med student in college. = NBC and MSNBC (1991‚Äì2003) = O'Brien began her career as an associate producer and news writer at WBZ-TV, then the NBC affiliate in Boston. She joined NBC News in 1991 and was based in New York as a field producer for the Nightly News and Weekend Today. She then worked for three years as a local reporter and bureau chief for San Francisco NBC affiliate KRON. At KRON she was a reporter on \\"The Know Zone.\\" Starting in 1996 and during the dot-com boom, O'Brien anchored MSNBC's weekend morning show and the cable network's technology program The Site, which aired weeknights from the spring of 1996 to November 1997. The show was unique in that she interacted with a virtual character named Dev Null, played by Leo Laporte in a motion-capture suit. From July 1999 to July 2003, O'Brien was co-anchor of the NBC News program, Weekend Today with David Bloom. During that time she contributed reports for the weekday Today Show and for weekend editions of NBC Nightly News. She also covered such notable stories as John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash and the 1990s school shootings in Colorado and Oregon. = CNN (2003‚Äì2013) = American Morning (2003‚Äì2007)  O'Brien moved to CNN, where from July 2003 to April 2007, she was co- anchor of the CNN program, American Morning CNN's flagship morning program that aired live from New York City. In 2004, at the age of 38, she was named to Crain's New York Business \\"40 Under 40\\" list. In 2005, she covered the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, where she interviewed then head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Michael Brown.  Starting Point (2012‚Äì2013)  From January 2012 to March 2013, O'Brien was anchor of the CNN program, Starting Point. After CNN canceled American Morning and replaced it with two new programs, Early Start and Starting Point in 2011, O'Brien began anchoring Starting Point on January 2, 2012. It was announced on February 21, 2013, that O'Brien had reached an agreement with CNN to leave Starting Point for the new Starfish Media Group production company. CNN would provide funding in return for non-exclusive rights to its documentaries. March 29, 2013, was her last day on air at CNN as an anchor.  Other work  In 2009, O'Brien completed a documentary titled Latino In America, documenting the lives of Latinos living in America. She continued working as a reporter for CNN, mainly hosting \\"In America\\" documentaries, and occasionally filled in for Anderson Cooper on Anderson Cooper 360. She also anchored exit poll coverage during CNN's coverage of the primaries and caucuses in the 2008 United States presidential race, and filled in for Paula Zahn on Paula Zahn Now before Zahn left CNN in 2007. O'Brien anchored a CNN special, Black in America, in July 2007. The program documented the successes, struggles, and complex issues faced by black men, women and families 40 years after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. In the first installment, O'Brien investigated how James Earl Ray, an armed robber and escaped convict, had already spent a year on the run a month before his path collided with that of Dr. King in Memphis, Tennessee. In \\"The Black Woman & Family\\", O'Brien explored the varied experiences of black women and families and investigated the disturbing statistics of single parenthood, racial disparities between students, and the devastating toll of HIV/AIDS. The fifth installment of the Black in America series aired in December 2012. Her report on children and race featured the work of Margaret Spencer, based on the Doll Tests of the 1940s, polling children on their general color preferences: \\"white children have an overwhelming white bias, and black children also have a bias toward white, according to a new study..\\" = HBO (2013‚Äìpresent) = O'Brien's Starfish Media Group signed a deal granting HBO first-look rights for new programs or concepts it develops.  Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel (2013‚Äìpresent)  It was announced on June 12, 2013, that O'Brien was joining HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel sports news magazine as a correspondent.  Starfish Media Group  In June 2013, O'Brien formed the production and distribution company, Starfish Media Group. Starfish Media Group signed a deal to produce a series of hour-long documentary specials for Al Jazeera America. In September 2016, O'Brien became a host of the Hearst Television show, Matter of Fact with Soledad O'Brien; in addition to its broadcast availability, it is carried by FYI (American TV channel) on Sunday mornings (a network Hearst partly owns).  Other work  From 2013 to 2016, O'Brien was moderator of National Geographic Bee, replacing Alex Trebek who moderated for 25-plus years. In 2014, O'Brien co-taught a Harvard University Graduate School of Education class with Professor Joe Blatt on \\"Advancing the Public Understanding of Education.\\" On May 1, 2016, O'Brien hosted PBS NewsHour Weekend, filling in for Alison Stewart. On January 12, 2016, O'Brien appeared on PBS's TV genealogy program, Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s Finding Your Roots. The focus was on O'Brien's Irish ancestry. In 2016, O'Brien presented the 'I Am Latino in America' tour, with nationwide stops across the United States. The tour was streamed live globally on MOSH.  Personal life  In 1995, O'Brien married Bradford \\"Brad\\" Raymond, co-head of investment banking at Stifel. They have four children: two daughters, Sofia (October 2000) and Cecilia (March 2002), and twin sons Charles and Jackson (August 2004). On the NPR quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, O'Brien explained that in Spanish her full name means \\"The Blessed Virgin Mary of Solitude\\". When she started working in TV, many people recommended that she change her name, but she refused. O'Brien has said she does not speak Spanish fluently. O'Brien has been riding horses since she was 13 years old, a hobby which she now enjoys with her family. She and her husband run a foundation called PowHERful Foundation (formerly called the Starfish Foundation, and before that the Soledad O'Brien & Brad Raymond Foundation), which mentors women to send them to college.

Many of its wide variety of ecosystems have been preserved as parks and reserves, which are popular tourist attractions. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife is a governmental agency that maintains the wildlife conservation areas in the province. KwaZulu-Natal is home to some of the most popular game reserves and national parks in Africa. But, the province also extends 360 miles (580 kilometers) along the coast. This means that it offers a combination of inland game viewing, deep-sea fishing, SCUBA diving and snorkeling.  Public Game Parks and Nature Reserves  These are just some of the game parks and nature reserves in KwaZulu-Natal that are open to the public: * Royal Natal National Park * Burman Bush * iSimangaliso Wetland Park (part of the Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area) ** Mkuze Game Reserve * Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve ‚Äì the oldest national park in Africa. * Itala Game Reserve * Phinda Resource Reserve * uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park (part of the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area) * Oribi Gorge * Empisini Nature Reserve * Krantzkloof Nature Reserve * New Germany Nature Reserve  Wildlife  The main attraction to these parks and reserves is the wildlife species that can be found within them. These are best enjoyed on guided game drives and safaris, where a guide can provide information on the local predators, prey, fauna and flora. South Africa is known for the Big 5, which comprises lion, elephant, rhinoceros, Cape buffalo and leopard. Other exciting species include the hippopotamus, giraffe, hyena, zebra, warthog, kudu and African wild dog. This area is also renowned for its wide array of birds. These include the martial eagle, secretarybird, African pygmy kingfisher, lilac-breasted roller and many more.  Tourism  The game parks and reserves of KwaZulu-Natal are a major draw-card for tourists from all over South Africa and the world. This province also has an excellent infrastructure.

It is a predominantly middle-upper class residential suburb, located 10 kilometres southwest of the centre of Napier. Its population was 10,659 in the 2013 Census, an increase of 270 from 2006.The population shown is the sum of the populations for the Area Units of Taradale North () and Taradale South (). The Taradale ward including the areas of Greenmeadows , Meeanee , and Poraiti , is an estimated population of 20,910. For hundreds of years, hills overlooking what is now Taradale were the site of villages occupied by MƒÅori people, latterly of the NgƒÅti Kahungunu tribe. Europeans started settling at Taradale in the 1850s, and it was officially recognised as a town in 1886. It was a town district from 1886 to 1953, and a borough from 1953 to 1968, when it merged with Napier City. The Taradale area is home to some of New Zealand's oldest and finest vineyards and wineries, with a wine-making heritage dating back to the 1850s. History = Early MƒÅori history = Several hundred years ago there was a large MƒÅori pƒÅ (fortified settlement) on the hills at the southern edge of what is now Taradale. Originally a double pƒÅ, the top part was called Hikurangi and the bottom Otatara. Occupied by a tribe known as Tini-o-Awa or Ngati Awa, the pƒÅ terraces enclosed about 100 hectares and were home to around 3000 MƒÅori. The pƒÅ was on an excellent defensive site beside the Tutaekuri River, which was navigable by canoe from the sea. Food was plentiful, the hillsides were suitable for kumara growing and much of the area was a large tidal location with fish, eels and shellfish. The pƒÅ was attacked early in the 16th century by the NgƒÅti Kahungunu tribe under chiefs Taraia and Rakai-hiku-roa. They came from Turanga, near what is now Gisborne, and defeated the Hikurangi pƒÅ. Unable to take Otatara at that time, Taraia set up a new pƒÅ at Pakowhai. Some time later he organised another war party and again besieged Otatara. Legend has it that Taraia waited until the defenders were short of food. He then left, leaving a small party concealed near a patch of fern. The defenders sent two men out to dig for fern roots. They were ambushed then killed and their places taken by two of Taraia's men. When the defenders saw the men digging they thought them to be from Otatara so they opened up the pƒÅ and went out to help. Taraia's men attacked and killed many of the local MƒÅori. The pƒÅ then collapsed and was abandoned. Over the years marriages took place between local MƒÅori and NgƒÅti Kahungunu and peace was restored. Today the Otatara pƒÅ site has become a memorial to the MƒÅori who were so prevalent in the area many years ago. = Early European history = Taradale has a rich heritage stemming from its key role as the original gateway to the inland routes (including Taupo, Auckland and Taihape) and to the farms and settlements of its hinterland. In 1851 Donald McLean purchased, on behalf of the Crown, the Ahuriri Block which included present-day Taradale and Greenmeadows. By the mid-1850s settlers began flocking to the province. The census held in 1856 showed that in Hawke's Bay there was 1057 male and 458 female. The government purchased the Tutaekuri Block in 1856 which was subdivided, with Ahuriri Block, as the river Meeanee District and released for sale in April 1857. William Colenso purchased several blocks of land, a large block in Puketapu, Meeanee and 364 near Otatara. This block stretched from Guppy Road to the Puketapu hills and was bounded by the Great North Road (now Meeanee/Puketapu Roads) and the Tutaekuri River. Henry Stokes Tiffen bought most of the land north of the road to Puketapu and west of Guppy Road and named it Green Meadows after the native danthonia grass which covered the region. Henry Alley came to the area and leased land from Colenso in 1858, naming the area Taradale. Naming of Taradale It was previously thought that Alley called the area Taradale after the hill of Tara, County Meath, Ireland, where he was supposed to have been born. However, death records show that Henry Alley was not born in County Meath but in Queen's County, Ireland. He emigrated to South Australia and then Victoria, Australia where he lived in the Victorian township of Taradale until circa 1855, where he and his sister purchased a number of blocks of land.Personal communication and land purchase records Henry Alley built what was reputed to be the first house, somewhere in the vicinity of Alley Place and Lowther Place. Taradale High School retains a link with the early days of Taradale, its emblem incorporating the Tara Brooch.Bartlett, M. & Hughes, I. (2006). Heritage Trails: Taradale. Taradale, New Zealand: The Taradale & District Community Development Association. Town Board & Borough Council In 1886 a petition was sent to the Governor of New Zealand, Sir William Francis Drummond Jervois, asking him to proclaim the district of Taradale as a dependent Town District under the provision of the Town Districts Act 1881. The Hawke's Bay County Council confirmed the petition and the Town District of Taradale was proclaimed on the second day of December 1886. A Town Board was formed with Messrs John Drummond (Chairman), Robert Davidson, Richard Martin, Richard Neagle and George Bradley. Mr William Waterhouse became the first Town Clerk. Taradale was administered by a Town Board from 1886‚Äì1963, and by Borough Council from 1963‚Äì1968. Military services Taradale's military history is typical of an early New Zealand town. The nearby Battle of Omarunui on 12 October 1866 saw the settlers and local Maori join to defend an attack from the Hauhau faction during the New Zealand Wars. The district volunteered its sons and daughters to fight in South Africa against the Boers, and again in World War 1, World War 2 and the subsequent engagements that New Zealand has committed to. =Twentieth century= 1931 earthquake Before the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake, Taradale and Greenmeadows were separated from distant Napier by a harbour lagoon and tidal mudflats, bridged from 1874 by the corduroy Taradale Road. Other access was by the coastal sandpits road to Awatoto, then to Meeanee village and the Great North Road (Meeanee Road). These barriers forced Taradale's township and pioneer farming settlers to develop staunch independence, setting up their own facilities, businesses and recreational resources. Many of the elements of this historic heritage remain today; as well as the geographical boundaries, Anderson Park and green patches on the edge of Greenmeadows are visual boundaries that separates Taradale and Greenmeadows from the rest of Napier City. As a consequence of the 1931 earthquake, the raised seabed enabled Napier's residential suburbs to spread slowly south towards Taradale and Greenmeadows as swamps were reclaimed. Buildings destroyed by the earthquake were rebuilt in Art Deco style architecture, examples being the Taradale Town Hall and Taradale Hotel (now a McDonald's restaurant). Garden Borough Taradale in the 1960s was one of the fastest-growing boroughs in New Zealand. Retailers considered it a good place to establish shops with rapidly expanding population. People took pride in their property and Taradale became known as the Garden Borough. Amalgamation Amalgamation with Napier had been proposed and disputed for many years, and the merger was passed by referendum in 1968. The final meeting of the Borough Council was held on 26 March 1968 and Taradale became a part of Napier City Council, even though it still retains its strong community spirit. The last Mayor of Taradale was Arthur Miller, a popular and respected member of the community. He is remembered for his public service, especially in his push to establish Taradale Intermediate and Taradale High School. His support for education was recognised in 1971 when a new school in Guppy Road was named Arthur Miller School. = Recent history = Taradale has continued to expand and develop, with a current growth rate of 6.7%, well above the Hawkes Bay regional growth rate of 3.9% and Napier of 3.2%. As new subdivisions meet the increased demand for middle to high-end residential property, there are several new subdivision developments underway in Mission Heights, Citrus Grove and Kent Terrace with over 1400 residential sections in progress. And recent upgrading of Taradale's Town Centre is bringing it into the 21st century, as $3.5 million in council funds has been committed to undertake a renovation including garden streetscape and enhanced pedestrian linkages to slow traffic and improve customer access. A revised parking plan forms part of the overall strategy as does further integration with public green space and services such as the library.  Governance  Napier City Council has organised the city into four wards ‚Äì the Taradale ward comprises Taradale, Greenmeadows, Poraiti, Meeanee and Awatoto, similar to the early Taradale district. The councillors of the Taradale ward are Graeme Taylor and Kirsten Wise.  Geography  Taradale is a predominantly middle- upper class residential township, nestled against the Taradale hills 10-minutes drive from the centre of the tourist destination of Napier City. It has over a third of Napier's population, and one of the highest socioeconomic demographic profiles in Hawke's Bay. Residential housing spans decades of design styles from villas through art deco. Premium housing is also scattered around the township. Homes in the elevated hill areas to the west of the town centre have views of Hawke's Bay, Cape Kidnappers and the Heretaunga plains. Many of Taradale's residents commute to the Napier or Hastings CBDs and prefer rural or suburban life as opposed to the city life of central Napier. Gloucester Street, the main street and shopping area, has core retail that is predominately contained within a traditional busy high street. Taradale's village is a vibrant destination with its boutique shopping, caf√© culture and atmosphere. Gloucester Street is within 2 km of the wineries in Church Road and is perfectly situated to benefit from the regular influx of visitors generated by these wineries. =Greenmeadows= Greenmeadows is an area some two kilometres north of the Taradale town centre, and an integral part of the Taradale community. Greenmeadows from the beginning has been seen as an extension of Taradale rather than a separate community, Greenmeadows formally became a part of the Taradale Town District in 1941. This gives the Taradale and Greenmeadows area which is also known merely as Taradale, or Greendale for local facilities; a population of roughly 17,000. It has a small shopping village with essential services and Greenmeadows New World supermarket.  Wineries  Mission Estate Winery ‚Äì one of a number of wineries in the area Taradale is a gateway to some of the finest and oldest wineries in New Zealand. The area is rich in wine heritage dating back as far as the 1850s. Two of the most famous vineyards in Hawkes Bay, Mission Estate Winery and Church Road Winery, together attract over 300,000 tourists annually. Mission Estate Winery, founded in 1851 and occupying its present site in Church Road since 1897, is the oldest New Zealand winery still in operation and is a tourist attraction. French Marist missionaries established the Hawke's Bay Marist Mission at Pakowhai in 1851. The mission was moved to Meeanee in 1858 and a vineyard was established to produce sacramental and table wines, and a church and school were built soon after. In 1880 a two-storied house was built as a seminary. Following the 1887 flood, an 800-acre (325 hectares) property in Church Road was purchased from Henry Tiffen and a new vineyard was established. Some of the original terracing can be seen on the hillside area now used for the Mission Concert held every February. In 1910 the Mount St. Mary Seminary building was moved from Meeanee to its present Mission location on Church Road. It was cut into eleven sections and rolled on logs towed by a traction engine, an operation that took two days. An accommodation block was built and opened in February 1931. The next day the Hawke's Bay earthquake struck, causing serious damage to the entire Mission. Two priests and seven students were killed when the stone chapel was destroyed. The seminary building was refurbished in the early 2000s to accommodate a restaurant and function rooms. The Mission is a popular venue for weddings. The Church Road Winery, formerly McDonald's Wines, was founded in 1897 by Bartholemew Steinmetz, a lay brother from the Marist Mission, and is one of the oldest wineries in Hawke's Bay. Some of its most illustrious years were spent under the leadership of pioneer winemaker Tom McDonald, now widely acknowledged as the father of New Zealand's premium red wine industry. The winery buildings have in recent years been refurbished and include a restaurant and function room. A wine museum, housed underground, traces the history and techniques of winemaking. With the rapid growth of the wine industry in Hawke's Bay the number of wineries in the Taradale area is increasing. Other wineries near the area include Brookfield's Vineyards, Dobel Estate situated on the banks of the Tutaekuri River, Moana Park Winery behind the Taradale hills and Tironui Estate nestled just below Sugarloaf hill. Landmarks The clock tower War Memorial Clock Tower The Taradale clock tower was built in 1923 as a Taradale and District World War 1 Memorial. The tower is situated where several roads converge and is a prominent landmark. Designed by John Ellis and built by Mr AB Davis the hexagonal tower stands 15m high. The tower was unveiled in 1923 by Admiral Viscount Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand. Following the 1931 earthquake, the tower developed a lean of but was able to be restored by John Ellis. In 1997 murals depicting the three armed services were painted by Brenda Morrell. Ormlie Lodge Ormlie Lodge was built by William Nelson in 1899 as a wedding present to his daughter Gertrude and son-in-law Hector Smith. The 1931 earthquake damaged the house extensively, forcing the Smiths to move out for two years while it was repaired at the cost of ¬£1764 (GB pounds). Gertrude and Hector, who had four daughters, lived their entire married life on the estate. Gertrude died in 1955; Hector remained in the villa another seven years until he sold it in 1962, just before his death at the age of 93. The new owners turned the home into a private hotel, and the stables were converted into one of Hawkes Bay's finest restaurants during the 1960s. For the next twenty years the gracious homestead went through a number of changes and owners. In 1985 fire destroyed the Stables Restaurant. The homestead itself was not touched by the blaze. The Stables Restaurant was never rebuilt. Soon after the fire, new owners bought the lodge, renovated it to its former glory, and engaged the services of the son of the original builder to construct the elegant ballroom, which is now the venue for weddings, conferences and other functions.  Facilities  Taradale Library When Taradale amalgamated with Napier in 1968, Taradale Library became a branch of Napier Library; the joint library service has been called \\"Napier Libraries\\" since a rebranding in 2008. Taradale Library was located in a building on Gloucester Street until 1995, when it moved to a new extension of the former Rugby Club Rooms on White Street. A 2007 study recommended that the Library building be extended to a total floor area of 1275 square metres. The current re-built and enlarged Taradale Library building opened on 13 July 2009. The upgrade of $1.7 million provided a light and spacious building that caters for the information, educational and recreational needs of all age groups. The new-look library makes the most of its setting in White Street, with comfortable seating and extensive windows that take advantage of views of Centennial and Taradale parks. Pettigrew Green Arena Pettigrew Green Arena is a large facility that can accommodate small or large sports games, concerts and fairs. It has a gym, squash / badminton facilities, yoga and ball training. It also has the Sports Hawkes Bay office, which helps with promoting sport to young people, organising games and competitions and has a service offered to young children to help them lead more healthy lives, as well as some programs for adults. Tareha Recreational Reserve Tareha Recreational Reserve is a sport and recreation ground at the southern end of Taradale, near the Tutaekuri River. The land was originally set aside as a Crown reserve in 1917, as part of a soil conservation and river control reserve for the river. The land was separated from the riverbed by the construction of the stopbank in 1970. Its ownership passed from the Hawke's Bay Catchment Board to the Hawke's Bay Regional Council, and during this period it was used as a nursery and for grazing stock. In 1992, the Taradale Rugby Club approached the regional council looking to lease the area for playing fields. The negotiations that followed saw the transfer of the land to Napier City to be developed as a recreation reserve for the rapidly expanding urban area of Taradale-Greenmeadows. The park's name commemorates Tareha Te Moananui, a MƒÅori tribal leader and member of Parliament who lived nearby at Waiohiki. Park Island Park Island sports and recreation ground is to the north of Taradale, within 5 minutes drive, and adjacent to the suburb of Tamatea. It is heavily used for local, regional and national sporting events, in particular soccer, hockey, and rugby.  Parks and reserves  Sugar Loaf The 127m hill known as Sugar Loaf or Pukekura dominates the Skyline of the western hills above Taradale and its distinctive shape can be seen from all over Taradale and parts of Napier. On the summit of the hill was once Pukekura Pa, an outpost pa of Otatara Pa and Hikurangi Pa, built and occupied at about the same time. Mr G Halliwell bought the hill and surrounding land from Henry Tiffen in the 1980s. It has always been a focus for recreation and a symbol in the area, probably due to the magnificent 360-degree views of Hawke's Bay from the summit. In the 1920s it was site of moonlight particularly popular with the younger set, and in the 1930s motorbike races were held in Taradale each Easter and the hill climb section took the riders up the steep slopes of Sugar Loaf. The hill did not escape unscathed in the earthquake of 1931. Church Road Winery winemaker Tom McDonald recalled 'seeing the top of the hill rise up in the air and fall down again an estimated seven feet'. The Halliwell family gave the summit and surrounding area in the 1980s to be retained as a reserve. Eastern views from the summit cover the Napier-Taradale area and much of the Heretaunga Plains, while western views include the Ruahine and Kaweka Ranges. The track to the summit is steep especially from the Cumberland Rise entrance. The walk is graded moderate to difficult. Care should be taken in wet conditions. The Taradale Hills are split into 4 parts: The pine tree-covered hill of Mission heights, the distinctive Sugarloaf, the reserve hill of Dolbel/Puketapu and the steep hill slope of Otatara. Otatara Pa Historical Reserve Located on a commanding hill site south of Taradale, Otatara Pa is among New Zealand's most important archaeological sites. Providing an insight into the area's Maori history, the original Otatara and Hikurangi pa sites are embraced in the 33-hectare historic reserve formed 25 years ago. Kaitiaki (caretakers) of Otatara, Ngati Paarau of Waiohiki have partnered up with the Department of Conservation in developing and managing the reserve. Maori occupied the knoll as long ago as the late 15th century, and it was here that Ngati Kahungunu gained a foothold in Heretaunga and spread to become the dominant iwi in Hawke's Bay and the Wairarapa. The remains of house terraces and food pits can still be seen, and restoration work has included tree planting, palisades and pouwhenua, the carved posts symbolising the relationship with Maori iwi and hapu and the land. Following the hilly track, walkers can appreciate the site's natural defensive qualities. Standing sentinel over the Heretaunga Plains to the south, both pa were protected from attack by cliffs, steep spurs and a steep drop to the Tutaekuri River. Dolbel Reserve The Reserve is named after brothers Philip and Richard Dolbel who came from Jersey to New Zealand in 1855, the farming land they owned included the present Dolbel Reserve. The reserve covers 18 hectares of flat land and hill terrain and a walk to the top gives extensive views over Hawke's Bay from Mahia to Cape Kidnappers. There are approximately 10 km of track both on the flat and climbing to the hilltop over open slopes and through gullies of native planting. In 1991 Taradale Rotary Club took on the project of creating a tree park on this council-owned reserve under the guidance of the former Napier Council Parks and Reserves Manager Don Bell. The vision of the Rotary was to establish a memorial park of trees for the free use of the community, with people able to arrange to plant a tree to mark an important family milestone. Anderson Park Anderson Park covers an area of 40 hectares and is situated on what was once a racecourse owned by Henry Tiffen. The Napier Racing set up their headquarters here in 1886 and racing continued until 1961. Several saltwater creeks, used as hazards in the horse races, traversed the area and the line of these can still be traced in the contours of the park. The large pond was used as a \\"borrowing pond\\", the silt being dredged and spread on the straight each season to level the top-dress it. In 1931 the large open space was used as a field hospital to cope with the casualties of the earthquake. After the stand was demolished the rubble, rather than being removed, was consolidated and grassed over, now forming a low mound on the southern side of the park. A block of the original stables has been preserved on the western edge of the park, today used as Parks and Reserve Department storage. The park could have become a residential subdivision but was acquired as a pleasure grounds in 1962 by the Napier City Council and has been developed in the fine open space it is today. On his death in 1962 Mr Haskell Anderson, after whom the park was named and founder of the large local nursery, be bequeathed to the Napier City Council to establish the JN Anderson Family Endowment Fund for tree planting. Taradale Domain and Centennial Park Taradale Park was opened in 1916 on land leased originally purchased by the Taradale Borough Council and over the years has become a valuable community amenity. The water wheel was erected by the Rotary Club in 1968. The wheel was originally built in 1920 and was used to generate electricity in a private home. Taradale Park is the home of the Taradale Sports Association which includes the Taradale Cricket Club, Napier Harriers Club, Greendale Tennis Club, and the Taradale Association Football Club. Taradale Public Library and associated parking are now on a separate title subdivided off Centennial Park. The southern corner of the reserve provides a children's play area and a skateboard bowl. Taradale Kindergarten and the Taradale Friendship Centre are also established on the reserve. A passive recreation area, the western extension ‚Äì Centennial Park ‚Äì is treed and includes a rose garden and water features.

Set up in 1948, by Bernard Lewis and his brothers in London. River Island is a private company owned by the Lewis family. History Store front at Castlepoint Shopping Centre. In 1948, Bernard Lewis started selling fruit and vegetables, and then knitting wool from a bombed-out site in the East End of London. Joined by his three brothers, the chain expanded to nine stores under the title Lewis Separates. By 1965 Lewis Separates had a 70 store empire in the UK and it was decided that the brand needed a new identity. Lewis Separates was re-branded to Chelsea Girl, the name chosen because at the time the King's Road in Chelsea was the hub of fashion, music and popular culture. Chelsea Girl became the first UK fashion boutique chain. In the late 1970s, two of the brothers left the business, leaving Bernard, David and their families in charge. They formed the Lewis Trust Group, for which David ran the other businesses covering hotels, property and investments, leaving Bernard to run the retail operation. This allowed the company to expand into menswear in 1982 with the launch of Concept Man stores, before they were merged with Chelsea Girl to become one retail brand under the name of River Island in 1988. In 1993, the brand opened its first shop in Republic of Ireland. Since then it has expanded into a dozen markets including Russia, Poland, and various countries in the Middle East. In 2010, River Island launched Kidswear. In 2011, Chelsea Girl was re-introduced as a capsule collection within River Island stores. In 2018 River Island launched RI Baby expanding its Kidswear offering. In September 2019 Will Kernan was appointed chief executive replacing previous CEO of 10 years Ben Lewis as the first non-family member in this role. Stores There are over 350 River Island stores across the UK, Ireland and internationally (over 250 of which are in the UK and Ireland), as well as six dedicated online sites. As of 2012, River Island no longer has physical shops in Singapore. In 2013, online fashion retailer Zalora began acting as a bridge between River Island and most of South-East Asia.

The motor in the designation originally referred to their use of petrol engines, typically marinised aircraft engines or their derivatives, which distinguished them from other naval craft of the era, including other torpedo boats, that used steam turbines or reciprocating steam engines. Later, diesel-powered torpedo boats appeared, in turn or retroactively referred to as \\"motor torpedo boats\\" for their internal combustion engines, as distinct from steam powered reciprocating or turbine propulsion. Though other navies built similar petrol-powered craft, the specific designation \\"motor torpedo boat\\", abbreviated to \\"MTB\\", is generally used for craft of the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Canadian Navy boats. During the Second World War, the US Navy built several classes of marine V-12-powered PT boat, whose hull classification symbol \\"PT\\" stood for \\"patrol, torpedo\\", but which were grouped into motor torpedo boat squadrons.Motor Torpedo Squadron ONE, Report for Pearl Harbor Attack, Naval History and Heritage Command German diesel-powered torpedo boats of the Second World War were called S-boote (Schnellboote, \\"fast boats\\") by the Kriegsmarine and \\"E-boats\\" by the Allies. These large craft (well over 100 ft overall) were not known as motor torpedo boats at the time, but later have been grouped with them by some. Italian MTBs of this period were known as Motoscafo Armato Silurante (\\"MAS boats\\", torpedo-armed motorboats). French MTBs were known as vedettes lance torpilles (\\"torpedo-launching fast boats\\"). Soviet MTBs were known as —Ç–æ—Ä–ø–µ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä—ã (torpyedniye katyery; \\"torpedo cutters\\", often abbreviated as TKA). Romanian MTBs were known as vedete torpiloare (\\"torpedo fast boats\\"). The role of the motor torpedo boat has been absorbed in modern navies by the fast attack craft.  History  MTBs in the Mediterranean, February 1945 Torpedo boats were designed for missions that variously involved high speed, operating at night, low speed ambush, and manoeuvrability to allow them to get close enough to launch their torpedoes at enemy vessels. With no significant armour, the boats relied upon surprise and agility at high speed to avoid being hit by gunfire from bigger ships. The British Royal Navy started developing particularly small, agile, and fast petrol-powered torpedo boats in the early 20th century, shortly before the beginning of the First World War. Known as coastal motor boats, these were only around 15 tons. They were joined by the Italian Navy's MAS boats, of 20-30 tons displacement. MAS 15 was the only motor torpedo boat in history to sink a battleship, the Austro-Hungarian vessel Szent Istv√°n in 1918. In the Second World War, Britain fielded a variety of MTBs, which were operated by Coastal Forces. A similar size boat with a different role in the Second World War was the BPB high-speed launch used by the RAF for air-sea rescue operations. Diesel-powered MTBs entered the Royal Navy with the patrol boat in 1954. The last MTBs in the Royal Navy were the two s of 1958, which were capable of .  Specifications  Many boats were designated MTBs. A variety of designs were adopted and built. For instance, a type, capable of , was shown in 1930. \\"Midget Torpedo Boat Has Forty-Knot Speed\\" Popular Science, April 1930, p. 38. =British MTBs= The following is an incomplete list of British motor torpedo boats:  Vosper \\"private venture boat\\"  Commander Peter Du Cane CBE, the managing director of Vosper Ltd, designed a motor torpedo boat as a private venture in 1936. She was completed and launched in 1937. She was bought by the Admiralty and taken into service with the Royal Navy as MTB 102. * Length: * Beam: * Draft: , The installed powerplant of three Isotta Fraschini 57-litre petrol engines delivered which gave her a speed of light and when carrying a full load. * Crew: 2 officers, 10 men. Armament was two torpedo tubes; depth charges, machine guns and 20mm Oerlikon were trialled on her. MTB 102 was the fastest wartime British naval vessel in service. She was at Dunkirk for the evacuation, where she served as Rear- Admiral Frederic Wake-Walker's flagship after the destroyer HMS Keith was sunk. She carried Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower when they reviewed the fleet before the Invasion of Normandy.  British Power Boat 60 ft MTB  They were based on the British Power Boat BPB rescue craft and were originally designed for the Royal Air Force but reduced to in length. They could carry two torpedoes and achieve a maximum speed of . The Royal Navy ordered their first (of a total of 18) in 1936. These entered service as MTB numbers 1 to 12 and 14 to 19. In the early days of the war, they were painted with different numbers and photos distributed to the press to give the impression the Royal Navy had more than they actually did. One photo was sent to the American monthly Popular Science showing the number twenty-three. \\"Fast Mosquito Boats Aid British Navy\\" Popular Science, December 1939  Vosper 70 ft MTB  Although various boat lengths were produced by Vosper for the Royal Navy, the \\"70 ft\\" boat was produced from 1940. The design was produced with modifications as MTBs 31-40, 57-66, 73-98, 222-245, 347-362, 380-395 and 523-537. Using three Packard V1-12 marine engines, they were capable of around . Early models carried two torpedo tubes, two machine guns and two machine guns. They could also carry four depth charges. The Vosper 70 was also used in other navies, such as Romania's, which acquired three in 1939, with NMS Viscolul the lead ship of the class.

Nicknamed \\"Dog Boats\\", they were designed to combat the known advantages of the German E-boats over previous British coastal craft designs. Larger than earlier MTB or motor gun boat (MGB) designs, the Fairmile D was driven by four Packard 12-cylinder 1250 horsepower supercharged patrol engines and could achieve 29 knots (54 km/h; 33 mph) at full load. The boat carried 5200 gallons of 100 octane gas for a range at maximum continuous speed of 506 nautical miles. = Canadian MTBs = MTB-460 of the Royal Canadian Navy These boats were designed by Hubert Scott-Paine for the Canadian Power Boat Company, and used by the Royal Canadian Navy 29th MTB Flotilla.

History The Sutton, London branch The company opened its first store in 1988, at the MetroCentre, Gateshead, quickly followed by a number of other stores. In October 1993 US Shoe Corp Cincinnati sold the seven of its LensCrafters' superstores in the United Kingdom to Vision Express. In 1995, the first store operating on a joint venture basis was opened. The company had grown to over 220 stores across the United Kingdom by 2007. In May 2008 Batemans Opticians was acquired, which comprised a seventy five store chain in Southern England. The majority of these stores have since been rebranded as Vision Express. There are currently 575 stores throughout the United Kingdom, Jersey and the Republic of Ireland. Of these stores approx. 195 are fully company owned, with the remainder being under joint Venture partnerships. Vision Express is also in Poland, where it has over 110 stores. It has recently opened a series of stores in India in partnership with Reliance. On 1 May 2013, Vision Express announced that it had acquired twelve optical stores from Crown Eyeglass Ltd. The stores, situated in the North West of England, will become part of the Vision Express portfolio, bringing its total number of outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland to 331. Eight of the properties currently trading as Crown Optical Centre and Direkt Optik will transfer optical services to nearby Vision Express premises and Vision Express will seek to retain the valued experience of the Crown Eyeglass Ltd personnel within the Vision Express store network. The remaining four stores will trade from their existing locations, with their existing teams under Vision Express branding. On 1 February 2014, the high street retail business of Rayner & Keeler Opticians was bought by Vision Express from JBR1910 Limited. On 1 December 2014 Vision Express announced the acquisition of the business of Liverpool-based Conlons Opticians for an undisclosed fee. It was stated that ten of the nineteen stores purchased would continue to trade from their current locations, with the existing store teams as part of the Vision Express portfolio, with the remaining eight stores transferring services to their nearest Vision Express store. The following day, it was announced that the store in Millom (which was due to be transferred to the nearby location of Barrow-In-Furness), would remain open following a review from local residents, bringing the total number of Vision Express stores to 390 by the end of 2014. Following a further announcement on 9 December 2014, Vision Express decided to continue to trade from the Conlons store in Annan as part of its portfolio. This increased the total number of stores to 391 by the end of 2014. December 2017 saw Vision Express announce the completion of the deal to incorporate 209 Tesco Opticians into their portfolio. This increased the Vision Express store count (in the UK) to 600. By June 2018, all the Tesco Optician stores had been rebranded to VE@Tesco. In late March of 2020, Vision Express closed non- essential branches indefinitely in a nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Onur K√∂ksal, (CEO) began to initiate the furlough of all non- essential staff. A small number of clinics are said to have remained open to offer essential, emergency clinical care. Takeover by Grand Vision Grand Vision acquired Vision Express in 1997. The French parent company Grand Vision has stores under various brands across Europe, and the rest of the world. Under franchise agreement there is a strong Vision Express brand present also in Latvian and Lithuanian markets. These shops were acquired from GrandVision by Latvian entrepreneurs of \\"LU Optometrijas Centrs SIA\\".

It was launched in 1984, by musician Dare Jennings and business partner, Andrew Rich in the Sydney suburb of Alexandria. On January 6, 2015 Mambo was acquired by American company Saban Brands. Early days: founding In the early 1970s Dare Jennings owned a large and successful screen printing business, Phantom Textile Printers, producing t-shirt and fabric prints for a variety of commercial clients. He also owned an independent record label, Phantom Records. Mambo began life as an \\"after hours\\" project in the Phantom art room. The graphics were initially created by in-house artists such as musician Jodi Phillis, and by freelance artist, Richard Allan whose first t-shirt graphics, 'Real Wrestlers, Real Wrestling' and, 'Call Of The Wild (Farting Dog)' were the best sellers. '100% Mambo' clothing was often available in surf / skate shops in the mid to late 1980s in the UK. As skateboarders wore a lot of surfer-inspired clothing, Mambo board shorts in loud / Hawaiian patterns were worn by skaters. Other similar surf / skate brands around at the time were Stussy, Life's A Beach and Vision Street Wear. As this was long before skate culture became mainstream (e.g. skate shops often only sold Vans, Vision or Converse shoes), these were usually niche products. Mambo graphic arts Allan's arrival at Mambo was followed by other Australian and overseas artists including, Reg Mombassa, Robert Williams (US), and Ben Frost. History and development-chronology  In 1994, the first Mambo 'Loud Shirt' was released. The design was influenced by the famous Hawaiian 'Aloha' shirt. It was called 'Blue Hawaii' by Martin Plaza (a bandmate of Reg Mombassa). This shirt became one of Mambo's best sellers and started the Mambo 'Loud Shirt' style. Mambo opened its first store in 1995. Located in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, it was called the 'Mambo Friendship Store'. Stores opened in other Australian cities and in the UK, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. By 2001, Mambo had opened 25 independent retail stores. In 2000 Mambo received an invitation from the Australian Wool Board to design the athlete's uniform for the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. After the Summer Olympic Games, Jennings was approached by Gazal Corporation to buy the brand. Jennings sold the company in March of that year and took over the role of creative director. He left the company two years later, in 2002. Jennings went on to create the surf- and moto-inspired brand Deus Ex Machina that have mixed retail, food & beverage and custom moto / surf / bicycle Flagships in Sydney, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Milan and Bali.

Sea Owl was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine on 7 February 1944; launched on 7 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas L. Gatch; and commissioned on 17 July 1944, Lieutenant Commander Carter L. Bennett in command. During World War II the U.S. Navy had two ships named Sea Owl at the same time, the SS-405 and a launched December 17, 1943.ISCO>http://www.isthmianlines.com/ships/sm_steel_scientist.htm It saw most of its service in the European Theater of Operations, with at least one round-trip into the Pacific after VJ-Day repatriating American troops.  World War II  After shakedown off Portsmouth, N.H., and New London, Conn., Sea Owl transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1944. Her first war patrol commenced on 19 November and was conducted in the East China Sea as part of a coordinated attack group with and . She carried trial versions of Mark 18 electric and Mark 27 (\\"Cutie\\") homing torpedoes.Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (New York: Bantam, 1976), p.788. After three weeks of searching for worthwhile targets, Sea Owl sank her initial victim, a Japanese destroyer escort, with one Mark 27. She followed with a second escort, stopped by a Mark 27 and finished off with one Mark 18, from about 1000 yd (910 m).Blair, p.788. This was the first combat success for both weapons. The remainder of the patrol was uneventful, and the submarine put into Guam on 15 January 1945. For her second war patrol, Sea Owl joined Piranha and in patrolling in Luzon Strait and the South China Sea. She was off Wake Island early on the morning of 18 April and sent Japanese submarine Blair, pp.834-5, dates it 16 April and names her RO-56, which appear to be mistakes. (of the RO-35 class) to the bottom. Her second patrol ended at Midway on 21 April. Sea Owl got underway for her third and final war patrol on 20 May in concert with Puffer and . This patrol was concentrated in the Yellow and East China Seas and was devoted to both lifeguard duties and offensive patrol. After 19 days, two Japanese destroyers were contacted and six torpedoes were fired from a perfect set-up. The first torpedo hit one of the destroyers in her magazine amidships, blowing her up in the water and allowing the other torpedoes to pass under the target and miss. The other destroyer joined forces with two patrol craft and vengefully dropped 84 depth charges during the following 14 hours but inflicted no material damage. Four days later, Sea Owl, in a gun attack, destroyed a large, rice-laden, four-masted schooner from which she captured two prisoners of war. On 2 July, she rescued six downed aviators after a race against darkness. All six were treated for wounds and were included in the crew for the remainder of the patrol. When the Japanese surrendered on 15 August, Sea Owl was in Pearl Harbor preparing for her fourth war patrol.  1945 ‚Äì 1951  Upon returning to the United States in September, Sea Owl was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and was based at Balboa in the Canal Zone as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6). From October 1946 through March 1947, she made a cruise along the west coast of South America and joined the other submarines of SubRon 6 in fleet exercises off Culebra Island in the West Indies. She next supported antisubmarine training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Key West, Fla. Sea Owl underwent overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from September 1947 to January 1948 followed by a brief period of refresher training in the Caribbean. She resumed her duties at Balboa on 12 January and, for the next 18 months, operated in the Panama area and Caribbean Sea participating in fleet training exercises. On 27 June 1949, Sea Owl arrived at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for a regularly scheduled overhaul and, upon completion in October, was assigned to SubRon 8 in New London, Conn. For the next two years she operated in the Atlantic, participating in fleet exercises and antisubmarine training.  1951 ‚Äì 1961  Sea Owl was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine in the Philadelphia Navy Yard from April to August 1951 and, for the next year, she participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises in the Caribbean area. Early in 1953, the submarine entered Charleston Naval Shipyard in South Carolina for overhaul and, upon completion, sailed to New London and then to the Caribbean as part of operation \\"Springboard.\\" After returning to New London in March, she departed for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, participating in fleet exercises and in Operation \\"Keystone\\" and visiting France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and Turkey in a three-month tour. Returning to New London in August 1954, Sea Owl spent the next two years in Atlantic and Caribbean waters training submarine school students and reserve personnel. After engaging in special operations in the late fall of 1956 and early 1957, the submarine resumed normal duties in the New London area until 1 September when she departed to engage in NATO exercises \\"Fishplay\\" and \\"Strikeback\\" in the northern Atlantic, returning to New London in October. In April and May 1958, Sea Owl participated in NATO Exercise \\"New Broom\\" and, upon returning to New London, engaged in local operations for the remainder of the year. After a five-month overhaul early in 1959, she participated in NATO Exercise \\"Fishplay\\" and spent the latter months of 1960 in her second deployment to the Mediterranean. Sea Owl commenced 1961 with an extended upkeep period followed by local operations in the New London area. On 6 March, she departed for another Mediterranean tour followed by a scheduled overhaul in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  1962 ‚Äì 1969  After the 1962 Christmas holidays, Sea Owl departed for the Caribbean to take part in the second phase of operation \\"Springboard\\" including antisubmarine warfare exercises and visits to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Immediately following, she was engaged in a two- week antisubmarine warfare exercise with surface and air units of the Royal Canadian Navy in the vicinity of Bermuda. In April 1963, she participated in Exercise \\"New Broom XI\\" with joint forces of the United States and Canada. The remainder of the year consisted of submarine school operations and training exercises in the New London area. On 8 February 1964, Sea Owl commenced a five-week availability at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard followed by participation in Exercise \\"Long Hook\\" with joint forces of the United States, British, Canadian, and Dutch Navies and in Exercise \\"Canus Silex\\" with Canadian and United States Naval forces. In September, the submarine participated in Exercise \\"Master Stroke\\" and Exercise \\"Canus Slamex\\" with United States, Canadian, and British forces and returned to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 2 November for a five-month overhaul. On 7 July 1965, Seal Owl put to sea for a four-month deployment to the Mediterranean and, after returning to New London, engaged in local exercises for the remainder of the year. Sea Owl spent 1966 providing services for the Submarine School and Operational Test and Evaluation Force in New London with time out for participation in Operation \\"Springboard\\" in the Caribbean. During 1967, she participated in various fleet and training exercises; and, on 22 May, deployed to northern European waters for a training and good will tour, returning in July. During a discharge physical examination, one of the crewman was discovered to have an active case of tuberculosis in an advanced stage. Due to the close environment and isolated atmosphere of the submarine, the crew was transferred to the United States Naval Hospital, St. Albans, N.Y., for three days of intensive tests. Following laboratory analysis, it was found that no other active cases existed, and the crew was returned to the submarine. Because of the unique living conditions of submarine life, Sea Owl served as a control group for clinical research for the Tuberculosis Service, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Operations for the year 1968 included various fleet exercises, including antisubmarine warfare operations with destroyer units and various NATO and United States ASW naval air squadrons. Training exercises included both officer submarine school and weekend reserve training cruises. Sea Owl participated in the U.S. Navy's search for the overdue and missing USS Scorpion. On 30 June 1969, Sea Owl was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-405. She departed New London on 7 July for her final deployment to the Mediterranean. Upon return, the submarine was ordered to commence preparations for deactivation. On 15 November, after more than 25 years of dedicated service, Sea Owl was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. Sea Owl was sold for scrapping, 3 June 1971. Honors and awards Sea Owl received five battle stars for World War II.

It was originally called Memphis Recording Service, sharing the same building with the Sun Records label business. Reputedly the first rock and roll single, Jackie Brenton and his Delta Cats' \\"Rocket 88\\" was recorded there in 1951 with song composer Ike Turner on keyboards, leading the studio to claim status as the birthplace of rock & roll. Blues and R&B; artists like Howlin' Wolf, Junior Parker, Little Milton, B.B. King, James Cotton, Rufus Thomas, and Rosco Gordon recorded there in the early 1950s. Rock and roll, country music, and rockabilly artists, including Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Charlie Feathers, Ray Harris, Warren Smith, Charlie Rich, and Jerry Lee Lewis, recorded there throughout the mid-to-late 1950s until the studio outgrew its Union Avenue location. Sam Phillips opened the larger Sam C. Phillips Recording Studio, better known as Phillips Recording, in 1959 to replace the older facility. Since Phillips had invested in the Holiday Inn Hotel chain earlier, he also recorded artists starting in 1963 on the label Holiday Inn Records for Kemmons Wilson. In 1957, Bill Justis recorded his Grammy Hall of Fame song \\"Raunchy\\" for Sam Phillips and worked as a musical director at Sun Records. In 1969, Sam Phillips sold the label to Shelby Singleton, and there was no recording-related or label-related activity again in the building until the September 1985 Class of '55 recording sessions with Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, produced by Chips Moman. In 1987, the original building housing the Sun Records label and Memphis Recording Service was reopened, by Gary Hardy as \\"Sun Studio,\\" a recording label and tourist attraction that has attracted many notable artists, such as U2, Def Leppard, Bonnie Raitt, and Ringo Starr. In 2005, Brian Setzer (of Stray Cats fame) released his Rockabilly Riot Vol. 1: A Tribute To Sun Records album. Although not recorded at Sun it did feature various Sun Records recordings including some hits and other more obscure songs. In 2007, Canadian rockabilly band the Kingmakers recorded a selection of originals and classics such as Elvis Presley's \\"That's All Right\\" at Sun Studio, released as their first CD \\"Live at SUN Studio\\". In May 2009, Canadian blues artist JW-Jones recorded with blues legend Hubert Sumlin, Larry Taylor and Richard Innes for his 2010 release at the studio. In July 2009, John Mellencamp recorded nine songs for his album No Better Than This at the studio. In 2011, Chris Isaak released \\"Beyond the Sun,\\" a collection of songs recorded at Sun Studio, most of which are cover versions of songs originally released on Sun Records. Beginnings and Phillips Records The front office of the Sun Studio, where office manager Marion Keisker worked and greeted many artists on their first visit to the studio, including a young Elvis Presley. In January 1950, WREC radio engineer Sam Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service at 706 Union Avenue with his assistant and long-time friend, Marion Keisker.Victor, pp. 399 Phillips had dreamed of opening his own recording studio since he was a young man, and now that it was a reality he was overjoyed. However, getting the company off the ground was not an easy task. To create revenue at the beginning, Phillips would record conventions, weddings, choirs, and even funerals. He also held an open door policy, allowing anybody to walk in and, for a small fee, record their own record. Phillips' slogan for his studio was \\"We Record Anything, Anywhere, Anytime.\\" In June 1950, Phillips and a friend, local DJ Dewey Phillips who was no relation, set up their own record label called Phillips Records.Guralnick/Jorgensen, pp. 8 The purpose of the label was to record \\"negro artists of the South\\" who wanted to make a recording but had no place to do so. The label failed to make an impact and folded after just one release; \\"Boogie in the Park\\" by Joe Hill Louis, which sold less than 400 copies.Worth/Tamerius, pp. 153 = \\"Rocket 88\\" = After the failure of Phillips Records, Phillips began working closely with other record labels such as Chess Records and Modern Records, providing demo recordings for them and recording master tapes for their artists. It was during this time that Phillips recorded what many consider to be the first rock and roll song, \\"Rocket 88\\" by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. Some biographers have suggested that it was Phillips' inventive creativeness that led to the song's unique sound, but others put it down to the fact that the amplifier used on the record was broken, leading to a \\"fuzzy\\" sound. The Sun Studio tour lends credence to the latter, with the tour guide saying the amplifier was stuffed with wads of newspaper. Sun Records In early 1952, Phillips once again launched his own record label, this time calling it Sun Records. During his first year he recorded several artists who would go on to have successful careers. Among them were B.B. King, Joe Hill Louis, Rufus Thomas, and Howlin' Wolf. Despite the number of singers who recorded there, Phillips found it increasingly difficult to keep profits up. He reportedly drove over 60,000 miles in one year to promote his artists with radio stations and distributors. To keep costs down, he would pay his artists three percent royalties instead of the usual five percent that was more common at the time. Phillips turned to alcohol when it looked like his label would once again fail, and he was put into a mental hospital at one point, reportedly getting electric shock treatment. Rufus Thomas' \\"Bearcat\\", a recording that was similar to \\"Hound Dog\\", was the first real hit for Sun in 1953. Although the song was the label's first hit, a copyright-infringement suit ensued and nearly bankrupted Phillips' record label.Victor, pp. 50 Despite this, Phillips was able to keep his business afloat by recording several other acts, including the Prisonaires, a black quartet who were given permission to leave prison in June 1953 to record their single, \\"Just Walkin' in the Rain\\", later a hit for Johnnie Ray in 1956.Victor, pp. 424 The song was a big enough hit that the local newspaper took an interest in the story of its recording. A few biographers have said that this article, printed in the Memphis Press-Scimitar on July 15, influenced Elvis Presley to seek out Sun to record a demo record.Guralnick/Jorgensen, p.12 Elvis Presley In August 1953, fresh out of his high school graduation the previous June, the 18¬Ω year old Presley walked into the offices of Sun. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\". He would later claim he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or was merely interested in what he \\"sounded like\\", though there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, \\"I sing all kinds.\\" When she pressed him on whom he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, \\"I don't sound like nobody.\\" After he recorded, Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: \\"Good ballad singer. Hold.\\"Guralnick, 1994, pp. 62‚Äì64 Presley cut a second acetate in January 1954‚Äî\\"I'll Never Stand In Your Way\\" and \\"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\\"‚Äîbut again nothing came of it.Guralnick, 1994, p. 65 Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused to a broader audience. As Keisker reported, \\"Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'\\"Miller, 2000, p. 72 In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, \\"Without You\\", that he thought might suit the teenaged singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \\"Scotty\\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.Jorgensen, 1998, pp. 10‚Äì11 The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1949 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \\"That's All Right\\". Moore recalled, \\"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'\\" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played \\"That's All Right\\" on his Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed \\"slapback\\". A single was pressed with \\"That's All Right\\" on the A side and \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" on the reverse. =Selling Presley= Within months Phillips saw his label expand significantly owing to the number of Presley records sold. Radio stations and record stores all over the South were eager to play them, and as Presley's profile grew over the next year, Phillips realized Sun was not large enough to break him throughout the United States. In February 1955, Phillips met with Colonel Tom Parker, a man known for his hustling skills as well as his managerial ones. Parker persuaded Phillips that Presley needed a national record label to help him further his career, and after several more months Phillips agreed to sell Presley's contract. He told Parker that he would require a $5,000 down-payment by November 15, as an advance on a $35,000 buy out fee. At the time, $35,000 was an unheard of amount of money for a recording artist's contract, especially one who had yet to prove himself on the national stage. Although Presley didn't want to leave Sun, according to Sun engineer Jack Clement, Phillips sold his contract because he needed the money to settle debts and pay off costs still associated with Rufus Thomas's \\"Bearcat\\" copyright-infringement suit. Phillips, however, insisted that he only offered Presley's contract for $35,000 because he believed it would put off any other record label from purchasing it. Regardless, Presley signed a record contract with RCA Victor in November 1955, and left Sun. Phillips used some of the money to further advance the careers of his other artists, by now featuring Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison. =Million Dollar Quartet= On December 4, 1956 an impromptu jam session among Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash took place at Sun Studio. The jam session seems to have happened by pure chance. Perkins, who by this time had already met success with \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\", had come into the studio that day, accompanied by his brothers Clayton and Jay and by drummer W.S. Holland, their aim being to cut some new material, including a revamped version of an old blues song, \\"Matchbox\\". Phillips, who wished to try to fatten this sparse rockabilly instrumentation, had brought in his latest acquisition, singer and piano man extraordinaire Jerry Lee Lewis, still unknown outside Memphis, to play piano on the Perkins session. Sometime in the early afternoon, Presley dropped in to pay a casual visit accompanied by a girlfriend, Marilyn Evans. He was, at the time, the biggest name in show business, having hit the top of the singles charts five times, and topping the album charts twice in the preceding 12-month period. Less than four months earlier, he had appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, pulling an unheard-of 83% of the television audience, which was estimated at 55 million, the largest in history up to that time. After chatting with Philips in the control room, Presley listened to the playback of Perkins‚Äô session, which he pronounced to be good. Then he went out into the studio and some time later the jam session began. At some point during the session, Sun artist Johnny Cash, who had recently enjoyed a few hits on the country charts, popped in. (Cash wrote in his autobiography Cash that he had been first to arrive at the Sun Studio that day, wanting to listen in on the Perkins recording session.) Cowboy Jack Clement was engineering that day and remembers saying to himself \\"I think I'd be remiss not to record this\\" and so he did. After running through a number of songs, Elvis and girlfriend Evans slipped out as Jerry Lee pounded away on the piano. Cash claims in Cash that \\"no one wanted to follow Jerry Lee, not even Elvis.\\" During the session Phillips spotted an opportunity for some publicity and called a local newspaper, the Memphis Press-Scimitar. Bob Johnson, the newspaper's entertainment editor, came over to the studio accompanied by a UPI representative named Leo Soroca and a photographer. The following day, an article, written by Johnson about the session, was published in the Memphis Press-Scimitar under the title \\"Million Dollar Quartet\\". The article contained the now-famous photograph of Presley seated at the piano surrounded by Lewis, Perkins and Cash (the uncropped version of the photo also includes Evans, shown seated atop the piano). This photo proves Cash was there, but the audio doesn't provide substantial proof he joined in on the session. Decline For several years after Presley left Sun, Phillips had success with other acts. Sun Studio became known as a place that nurtured talent and then encouraged it to expand with bigger labels. In 1959, Phillips moved Sun Studio to larger premises at 639 Madison Avenue. By the mid 1960s, Phillips had lost interest in recording and had instead branched out into radio. He opened several radio stations, beginning in the late 1950s, and Sun lost its reputation as an innovative recording studio. In 1968, Sun released its last record. In 1969, Mercury Records label producer Shelby Singleton - noted for producing the Ray Stevens' hit \\"Ahab the Arab\\" in 1962, and later Jeannie C. Riley's 1968 hit single \\"Harper Valley PTA\\" on his Nashville-based Plantation Records label - purchased the Sun label from Phillips. Singleton merged his operations into Sun International Corporation, which re-released and re-packaged compilations of Sun's early artists in the early 1970s. Singleton moved the firm to Nashville, and sold the building to a plumbing company, who eventually sold it to an auto parts store.Worth/Tamerius, p. 191 Since, Sun Records Studio has been used as a setting for the film biopics Walk the Line, Great Balls of Fire, Mystery Train and Elvis. Re-opening In 1987, ten years after Presley died, Sun Studio at 706 Union Avenue was converted back into a recording studio, and soon became a tourist attraction for Presley fans and music lovers in general. The studio was also used by several well known acts to record, including U2, Def Leppard, John Mellencamp, the Bogus Bros. and Chris Isaak & Silvertone to name a few. In 2003 it was officially recognized as a National Historic Landmark tourist attraction.Victor, p. 508 Sun Studio regularly releases studio session podcasts on YouTube and on Public Television. Sun Studio have announced that PBS affiliate stations will be showing a 30-minute series of Sun Studio Sessions starting in January 2010.

The 2013 census showed that 1401 people reside in Woodville. The town is in the Tararua District and the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region, although it has strong ties with the Hawke's Bay region, of which it was once a part, but is often considered to be the northern boundary of Wairarapa. It is within the catchment area of the Manawatu River.  Manawatu River and Manawatu Gorge  Only a few kilometres west of Woodville, the Manawatu River runs from east to west and cuts a deep gorge through the mountains, effectively slicing a mountain range in two. It is unusual geology as the river flows east towards the Pacific coast of the lower North Island, then cuts back west through the gorge and flows out into the Tasman Sea near Foxton. Known by MƒÅori as Te Apiti, the gorge itself features in MƒÅori mythology as the consequence of a show of strength by Okatia as he made his way to the sea. Hacked into the steep sides of the gorge on each side of the river are a road, now permanently closed, and a little-used railway. Since the indefinite closure of the Manawatu Gorge road, the Saddle Road and the Pahiatua Track now provide the easiest access between the east and west coasts of the southern North Island. Once a vital route between Manawatu, Hawkes Bay and Wairarapa, geologic instability means the Manawatu Gorge road will never be re-opened. A new 4-lane road project was approved by the NZ Government in September 2019. It will be built between the existing Saddle Road and the Manawatu Gorge, connecting to SH2 west of Woodville. History Woodville, New Zealand Main Street 1890s Woodville is at the northern end of the Tararua Range and the southern end of the Ruahines. In MƒÅori history, it appears to have been a traveller's rest spot and a place for hunters to rest after they had walked from one side of the Manawatu Gorge to the other. The local iwi were Rangitane, descended from Whatonga of the Kurahaupo canoe. They maintained strong and positive relations with other tribes for the most part. One local landmark is Whariti, one of the main peaks in the Ruahine Ranges, a mountain range that runs north east for 110kms from the Manawatu Gorge to the Kawekas, inland from Napier. The name for the 920m/3017 foot high mountain appears to be a corruption of the original name Wharetiti (Whare ‚Äì house, titi ‚Äì muttonbird (the Sooty Shearwater)). According to an interview on Radio Woodville in 2009, the peak gained its name when migrating muttonbird nested on top of the ridges of the Ruahine mountain range. The birds arrived at Wharetiti from Bare Island, Waimarama and continued northwards to Tongariro. Local MƒÅori would construct temporary housing when the titi began to arrive and would harvest the birds from their burrows, preserving them inside pouches made from bull kelp which they carried up from the coast. It is some years since muttonbirds were last seen in this part of the Ruahines. Transport State Highway 3 through the gorge, on the southern Tararuas side of the river, is closed. It will be replaced with a new state highway in the 2020s. The Palmerston North - Gisborne railway line runs along the northern bank of the river. At Woodville Railway Station, the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line meets the Wairarapa Line and a balloon loop - a rare example of railway engineering where trains reverse direction on a loop track built specifically for the purpose - permits through running via the Wairarapa to Wellington. Due to low freight levels, the northern portion of the Wairarapa line was reviewed in 2010 as part of KiwiRail's turnaround plan. It remains a low traffic network. In some weeks there is only a single train on the line, running from Wellington to Napier. The use of the railway by Fonterra for bulk milk haulage from Oringi meant the Hawke's Bay line was sufficiently busy. Fonterra's Oringi milk transfer station was decommissioned in 2015-16. Industry Woodville's place in European migration history was established when it became the third of three sizeable timber milling towns in the 'Seventy Mile Bush' which extended along the eastern side of the Tararua and Ruahine Ranges. The others were Dannevirke and Pahiatua. As farmland was settled and cleared, a number of small dairy factories were established to process the supply of milk for consumption as milk, cheese or other dairy products. As recently as the mid-1980s the dairy factory at the western end of Woodville, on State Highway 2 heading towards the Manawatu Gorge, operated a cheese processing line and a 'factory shop' selling dairy produce direct to the public. A thriving sheep and beef economy at one stage supported a number of local trucking firms and carriers, among them Gunn Transport and Hawkes Bay Farmers Transport, both of which were based at a site at the corner of State Highway 2/Vogel Street and Tay Street, which is the Wairarapa bypass. The site is now the offices for Horizons Regional Council. These haulage businesses were only economic in the pre-deregulated transport industry that existed prior to the Rogernomics reforms of the Lange Labour Government elected in 1984. With the lifting of distance restrictions (vehicles over a certain weight were at one stage restricted to travelling only 150km from their geographic base) Woodville's role as a transport hub quickly fell away. In addition, the local community sustained a supermarket (closed for a period in the 1980s, since re-opened as a Four Square) a Feltex fabrication factory, built in the mid-1970s and closed by the mid-1980s - at least four or five service station or garage outlets of which only one remains on the west side of the township (Known as Caltex Woodville), and a significant railway presence. The advent of the Oringi Meatworks in 1980-81 was a boost to Woodville's economy as a consequence of significant wage inflows from Woodville people working at Oringi. Oringi's plant closed in 2008. Very little light industry has survived into the 21st century, and the local agricultural community is supported from Palmerston North, Pahiatua or Dannevirke. Milk from farms in the Woodville district was, until 2015, transported by rail from the Oringi Milk Transfer Station to Hawera for processing. It is now processed locally at the Fonterra plant in Pahiatua. There has been a boost to the local economy with the construction and maintenance of the Te Apiti Wind Farm on the ridges above the town. The foothills of the Ruahine and Tararua mountain ranges are to the west of Woodville. The lower ridges are now dotted with wind turbines making up New Zealand's largest wind farm, which was established in the early 2000s. The prevailing westerly winds in the Manawatu-Southern Hawkes Bay region provide a consistent Median Wind Velocity which is the key relevant measure for wind generation as a renewable energy source. Manawatu's flat pastoral lands and in particular the funnel effect created by the Manawatu Gorge, mean the area is well known for being subject to regular high winds. Following detailed assessment and testing in the early 1990s, the decision was made by newly privatised electricity generation companies to site two large farms on the ridge-lines. The Te Apiti Wind Farm is made up of 55 turbines, generating c.90MW of electricity, enough to power approx 30,000 homes. Woodville now uses this fact as part of its promotion. However many people consider the windmills to be an eyesore and believe they are detrimental to the environmental landscape, seen as far away as Palmerston North. Culture Te Ahu a Turanga i Mua marae is located in the Woodville area. It is a tribal meeting ground of RangitƒÅne and its NgƒÅti Te Koro and NgƒÅti Te Rangiwhakaewa sub-tribe. It includes Te Ahu a Turanga i Mua meeting house. One of New Zealand's first international hit songs - 'Blue Smoke' - was written by Ruru Karaitiana, who was born on a farm between Woodville and Dannevirke. Karaitiana served with the MƒÅori Battalion in WW2 and wrote and recorded the song on his return to New Zealand. It has been recorded by numerous artists over the last 70+ years, not least of whom was Dean Martin. Woodville was the original home of the Mountain Rock Music Festival, a celebration of New Zealand music growing to be the largest celebration of New Zealand music during the 1990s. Artist Gottfried Lindauer is buried in the local Old Gorge cemetery. Sport Woodville has produced a number of well-regarded sporting competitors, particularly in the 1980s. Perhaps the most interesting sporting link of all is through Robert Collings Tennent, who formed the first rugby club in New Zealand when he lived in Nelson. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he moved with his family to New Zealand in the 1860s and was only 19 at the time he set up Nelson Rugby Club. He later moved north and was instrumental in forming more rugby clubs in Taranaki (Patea) and Manawatu. He also played first-class cricket in Nelson in the 1870s. Tennent later moved to Woodville and is buried in the Old Gorge Cemetery. Among them are * Atholstan Mahoney, played 26 times for the All Blacks between 1929 and 1936. Mahoney played in 4 tests against Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England on the 1935-36 tour. * Dean Kenny, 1986 All Black was born in Woodville and attended Palmerston North Boys High School. Kenny played more than 100 games for Otago and 3 times for the All Blacks on a tour to France. * Robbie McLean, 1987 All Black who played for the Woodville Rugby Club and Wairarapa-Bush at the time of his national selection. McLean was born in Hawera and was highly regarded by then selector and former All Black No 8 Brian Lochore. * Rob Thompson, 2018-2019 Maori All Black. Made his debut for Canterbury in 2013, the Crusaders 2014-15, Otago Highlanders 2018- present in Super Rugby. It was his return to play for Manawatu in 2018-19 that lead to his selection for the MƒÅori All Blacks. * Eric Ropiha, successful racehorse and jumps trainer, who trained numerous quality horses including Caulfield Cup winner Ilumquh, 1952 New Zealand Cup winner Conclusion, Roman Consul (New Zealand Derby), Routine (NZ Oaks), Baraboo (Railway Handicap), Baloo (two-time Canterbury Gold Cup winner) and Judge (Grand National Hurdles). Ropiha went close to winning the centenary Melbourne Cup with Ilumquh, and he also trained Fans to place third in the great race. Ilumquh placed again in the race also. * Brendon Timmins, played more than 150 first class games for Otago, Southland, the Highlanders and New Zealand 'A' rugby sides in the 1990s. Timmin's son Sam is an elite basketballer, having played for NZ age grade sides. * Rob Foreman, played more than 100 games for Manawatu. Also selected for NZ Universities * Joe Schmidt, played both first class rugby and first division basketball for Manawatu sides before becoming one of the world's leading rugby union coaches. Schmidt played for National Basketball League side Ubix Palmerston North in the 1986-87 seasons. Schmidt also played first-class rugby on the wing for Manawatu. As a coach, he has posted a successful coaching with teams in New Zealand and Europe, including winning the Heineken Cup with Irish province Leinster and three Six Nations titles with Ireland. Teams coached by Schmidt have beaten the New Zealand All Blacks on two occasions. Schmidt retired from the Irish coaching position at the end of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Woodville continues to host a successful horse-racing, rearing and training industry, based at the Woodville & Pahiatua Jockey Club's track on the north-east of the town. Woodville has hosted the New Zealand MotoCross Grand Prix motorcycling races since 1961. Now widely regarded as New Zealand's premier motocross event, the Woodville Grand Prix is held in the height of summer in January each year. Held on the Cleghorn farm near the eastern entrance to the Manawatu Gorge, the honours board to 2011 features several well-known motorsport names, not least of whom is Ken Cleghorn (of the farm owning family) himself. Another notable early racer was Tim Gibbes of Palmerston North, who helped teach Hollywood actor Steve McQueen several stunts for The Great Escape.

Early life Details of Senzaki's early life are unclear. Town records in Fukaura, Aomori state Senzaki was born on October 5, 1876 as the Senzaki family's first son. He was named Aizo Senzaki. As a youth, Senzaki's grandmother told him he had been abandoned as an infant and was discovered by a fisherman from Sakhalin island, Siberia who reportedly brought him back to Aomori Prefecture.Tanahashi & Chayat. 3Nordstrom . 7 His father is unknown, but he was either Russian or Chinese. Aizo's grandmother was perhaps misinformed in her version of events, because some accounts state young Senzaki was adopted by a travelling Kegon Buddhist priest and brought back to Japan.Besserman & Steger. 142Chayat. 2Shimano . 9 Early training When Senzaki was five years old his mother died. He was sent to a Pure Land temple run by his grandfather, with whom he began the study of many Chinese classics. The elderly priest had a profound influence on him, which was, as Nyogen Senzaki later wrote, \\"to live up to the Buddhist ideals outside of name and fame and to avoid as far as possible the world of loss and gain\\".Chayat . 2Senzaki . 161-63 When Senzaki was 16 his grandfather died, stating to Aizo just before dying: When his grandfather died Senzaki left his grandfather's temple and enrolled in a school to prepare for medical school. According to his own account, he read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin while in school and tried to imitate Franklin's approach toward spirituality. He felt himself drawn a bit to Christianity, during this period, but ended up meeting a haiku poet who taught him about Matsuo Bash≈ç. By the age of 18 he had read the entirety of the Tripitaka. During this period he read about how Tokusan had burned a volume of Diamond Sutra commentaries he himself was currently studying. This was Aizo's turning point, and he decided to become a Zen Buddhist monk. On April 8, 1895 (on Vesak), when Aizo was 19, he was ordained as a monk and was given the Dharma name Nyogen at a Soto Zen temple. The word Nyogen means \\"Like a dream, like a fantasy\\" in Japanese and came from the concluding verse of Diamond Sutra.Shimano. 14Nordstrom. 5 Nyogen says he would have preferred to be ordained at a Rinzai temple, but there was none in his area. The next year Nyogen went to Kamakura to Engaku-ji where he studied Zen under Rinzai master Soyen Shaku. Soyen was a strict teacher who was very harsh and physical in his training methods. During this time Nyogen contracted tuberculosis and lived in virtual confinement in a small hut on the grounds of the monastery.Besserman & Steger. 143 The next year, on the verge of death, somehow his condition managed to improve and he was able to go back to the monastery. Here Nyogen came to meet another 20th-century pioneer of Zen, D.T. Suzuki. Suzuki was a lay student of Soyen Shaku. Nyogen was becoming disconcerted with the institutional practices of the monastery at the time, and turned to books as a means of release. Here he came across the works of Friedrich Fr√∂bel, the founder of kindergarten. In 1901, Nyogen asked Soyen if he could leave the monastery to open a kindergarten. He called it Mentorgarten, a place free of religiosity and ritual where children could be children. America By the start of the 20th century Japan had become dangerously nationalistic. In 1905 Soyen Shaku was asked by friends in the San Francisco, CA area to come and give talks and lectures on Buddhism. Soyen needed an attendant for his time there, and asked Nyogen to come with him. Nyogen jumped at the opportunity, for he was dissatisfied with the nationalism all around him and the institutional way in which Zen was then being practiced. So they left that same year and landed in Seattle, WA where they stayed for a few days, and then headed for San Francisco. When it was time for the two to return to Japan, Soyen sensed his student's turmoil at the prospect of returning. In Golden Gate Park, Soyen Shaku set down his friend Nyogen's suitcase and said the following to him: With those words Shaku spun about and left Nyogen there, and the two would never meet face to face again. Nyogen stayed in the USA for the rest of his life, with the exception of a trip in 1955 back to Japan to visit his friend Soen Nakagawa. In the San Francisco area Nyogen performed jobs as a hotel clerk and elevator assistant (among other jobs) to get by. He certainly was struggling with his finances. During his spare time Nyogen would visit the San Francisco Public Library often and read books on Immanuel Kant, Ralph Waldo Emerson and William James. He was studying English and developed a good grasp of the language. Floating Zendo In 1919 Nyogen received word that Shaku had died back in Japan. Around this time, he compiled the famous book 101 Zen Stories. In 1922 Nyogen scraped together enough money to rent out a hall and lecture on Zen. He continued this, moving from place to place throughout the city teaching about Zen meditation. By 1927 he had developed a small following with his \\"floating zendo.\\" His only material whilst going from hall to hall was a picture of Manjusri Bodhisattva. Eventually, along with the help of some students, he managed to rent an apartment in San Francisco where he would hold practice. During this period he even had a guest speaker from Japan come to lecture, Gyudo Furukawa. Nyogen moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s, where he again rented out an apartment and continued the so-called \\"floating zendo\\" model. Soon Senzaki became familiar with the community of Japanese immigrants there. In 1932 he befriended a Japanese woman named Kin Tanahashi, who had a mentally retarded boy. Nyogen cared for the boy in exchange for room and board. It was Mrs. Tanahashi who introduced Nyogen to the haiku poetry of Soen Nakagawa, an unconventional young monk practicing in Japan, who would go on to become one of the most prominent Rinzai Zen teachers to come West. Senzaki was extremely impressed with these poems, so he contacted Soen and they began corresponding with one another. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Senzaki was among the tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans to be relocated to internment camps. He spent the duration of World War II in Heart Mountain, Wyoming. At the conclusion of the war, Senzaki moved what he called his \\"Floating Zendo\\" to Los Angeles. While making his living in a number of ways he devoted his passion for the rest of his life to teaching Zen. Among his students at this time were Robert Aitken, who would become one of the most significant of modern Western Zen teachers, and Samuel L. Lewis who would later be known as a prominent Sufi teacher in the line of Hazrat Inayat Khan and Zen teacher in the lineage of Korean Zen Master Dr. Kyung-Bo Seo. Also, Senzaki maintained his long-term correspondence with Soen Nakagawa. Senzaki died on May 7, 1958 at 81 years old.

Created by Eileen Buckholtz and Ruth Glick, the YA series combined adventure stories with computer activities. The cover of the first Micro Adventure book, Space Attack The books are noted for the inclusion of short BASIC type-in programs related to the plot of the story that the reader could type into their computers, and also for the use of second-person narration (rather like the Choose Your Own Adventure series, though unlike those, Micro Adventure storylines could not be influenced by the decisions of the reader). The combination of these two elements made the Micro Adventure books something of an immersion experience. Through the second-person narration, the reader took the part of Orion, a computer expert and agent for the Adventure Connection Team, and followed the action in the continuing struggle against ACT‚Äôs nemesis, BRUTE (Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and Evil). The plots generally resembled those typically found in other works of the secret agent/adventure genre, ranging from sabotage aboard a space station to android doubles of the President of the United States, but stand out for their clever twists and lack of \\"dumbing down\\" often found in similar juvenile literature. The programs themselves were actually quite impressive, some even being simple ‚Äúshoot-em-up‚Äù games, yet were all designed to be small (none were over 2K in file size, a must given the limitations of some personal computers available at the time, such as the TI-99/4A) and easily typed in by even the most novice programmer. Instructions were included on how to \\"tweak\\" the programs to make them run on almost any popular home computer of the time. As a bonus, an appendix to each book gave step-by-step analyses of each of the programs in that particular book as a method of teaching simple programming theory and construction.

Since beginning in 1961, it has grown to offer summer camp in 15 modern languages and school-year weekend programs mostly for Spanish, French, and German. Summer and winter programs are taught through a language and cultural immersion philosophy, which allows for experience-based learning. The Villages annually serves over 13,000 young people, aged 7‚Äì18, from every state of the US, as well as Canada and 31 other countries, and are sponsored by Concordia College of Moorhead, Minnesota, a private four-year liberal arts college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Mission Each village focuses on immersion in both the language and the culture(s) of its target. Counselors speak the target language from waking up to going to sleep, with the help of many communicative techniques designed to reduce frustration on the part of the villagers; villagers are encouraged to use as much of the target language as they can produce. By the end of the summer, even villagers with no previous encounters with the language remark on how much they are able to understand. CLV also aims to develop cultural awareness. Everything from the meals to the crafts to the games is tailored to the target culture(s). Village programs are designed to cast light on the cultures in question, as well as the diversity of cultures around the world, and can take on inter-village meaning in everything from \\"World Cup\\" soccer matches between nearby villages to simulating the European Union deliberating on an issue. Additionally, at CLV villagers are able to live with, play with, work with, and get to know foreign native speakers. CLV also sponsors an \\"International Day\\" twice yearly; it is free and open to the public and aims to foster further global awareness. Strong environmental goals encompass all aspects of the program, from recycling, waste reduction, water management, encouragement for campers to bring biodegradable toiletries, alternative energy sources like solar and geothermal power are implemented on the permanent site. The new Waldsee \\"BioHaus\\", the first certified passive house in North America, is a testament to these goals. The villages also have a relatively high vegetarian and vegan ratio, to which they cater. Villages There are architecturally and culturally authentic village sites (Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Russian, and Spanish) located near Bemidji, Minnesota on Turtle River Lake. There are also leased sites throughout Minnesota, as well as abroad in Switzerland and China. The road connecting the permanent villages at Turtle River Lake to the county road was purposefully constructed to be winding, to simulate the long trip to the target cultures represented at the villages. The original plans for these villages included a train to link all of the villages. Although this idea was scrapped, aspects of it still remain in several buildings. The German village's four-story administration building resembles a German train station and is called the Bahnhof (\\"train station\\"). The dining hall at Salolampi, the Finnish language village, is modeled after a famous Finnish train station. Additionally, the Turtle River Lake site has a World Inc. Peace Site with peace poles in the village languages at its heart, near the Norwegian village, Skogfjorden and the Bemidji and Turtle River Lake sites have European road signs in kilometers per hour (imported from Germany, not replications). Several immigrant buildings have been moved to the permanent sites to show villagers what life was like for early European immigrants. The immigrant cabins at the Norwegian village are original to the site. The German \\"Haus Sonnenaufgang\\" was first moved from New Ulm, Minnesota to sit next to the Norwegian ones, but was moved sometime in the early 1990s to the German village near Bemidji, Minnesota. Waldsee Markplatz near Bemidji, Minnesota. The culturally-authentic Gasthof dining hall can be seen in the background. CLV consists of 15 villages: * German: Waldsee (est. 1961) * French: Lac du Bois or Les Voyageurs (est. 1962) * Spanish: El Lago Del Bosque (est. 1963) * Norwegian: Skogfjorden (est. 1963) * Russian: Lesnoe Ozero (–õ–µ—Å–Ω–æ–µ –æ–∑–µ—Ä–æ) (est. 1966) * Swedish: Sj√∂lunden (est. 1975) * Finnish: Salolampi (est. 1978) * Danish: Skovs√∏en (est. 1982) * Chinese: Sen Lin Hu (Ê£ÆÊûóÊπñ) (est. 1984) * Japanese: Mori no Ike (Ê£Æ„ÅÆÊ±†) (est. 1988) * English: Hometown, USA or Hometown, Europe (est. 1999) * Korean: Sup sog«îi Hosu (Ïà≤ ÏÜçÏùò Ìò∏Ïàò) (est. 1999) * Italian: Lago del Bosco (est. 2003) * Arabic: Al-WƒÅ·∏•a (ÿßŸÑŸàÿßÿ≠ÿ©) (est. 2006) * Portuguese: Mar e Floresta (est. 2008). Each village is named \\"Lake of the Woods\\" in its language, (as the villages are situated in the woods next to a lake.)with the exception of the English villages Hometown, USA and Hometown, Europe, the Portuguese village Mar e Floresta (Sea and Forest), and the Arabic village al-WƒÅ·∏•a (\\"the oasis\\"). The Japanese village, Mori no Ike, literally translates as \\"Pond of the Forest,\\" but was chosen in lieu of the literal translation for the ease of pronunciation. =Village culture= Villagers performing skits Villagers use CLV-issued passports to manage their camp bank account and familiarize them with the use of a passport. Villagers also go through customs upon arrival, meaning no phones or other devices with internet connection, no literature in any language except the target language, and no food. (Perishable items will be disposed of.) Each language village site has numerous traditions, many of which are related to meals and songs. Meal presentations, in which each food and its name are presented in a short skit before each meal, are a language tool implemented by almost all programs. Many villages also put on a restaurant night for villagers to practice going out using their target language. Restaurants will often be fancy affairs that tend to represent international cuisine and languages that are not represented by the villages, such as Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, or Tibetan. The cuisine in most villages reflect the ethnic cuisines of the target language. At Waldsee, this means that German regional food, Austrian, Swiss and common import foods like Turkish d√∂ner kebab are served. At Lac du Bois, foods of Africa and the Caribbean may be included. The fusion of American and foreign cultures has created a strange linguistic phenomenon sometimes referred to as Lac du Bois's \\"Franglais\\" (French and anglais) or Waldsee's \\"Denglish\\" (Deutsch and English). Examples would be \\"Je need a couteau\\" (\\"I need a knife\\") or \\"What did you seh at the Kino?\\" (\\"What did you see at the movie theatre?\\"). This trend, however, is not limited to just the Lac du Bois and Waldsee camps, villagers at every camp employ a unique variety of code-switching with English and the target language. Site buildings are given names in the target language, and rarely does anyone refer to site buildings by their English names, even when speaking English. Additionally, some words have been invented by native-speaking staff members for concepts that are not native to the target cultures but daily words in camp life, such as \\"chipmunk\\", \\"poison ivy\\", and \\"mosquito repellent\\". =Village activities= A typical day at one of the Villages includes cultural and typical summer camp activities. In the target language, villagers might go canoeing, create art projects, play African drums, practice yoga, play ping-pong, or make a film. Camp songs and daily skits are an integral part of the village experience, as are jokes, games, and weekend dances, all of which surround campers with the language. Villagers also can attend a four-week program for high school credit. Obviously, the schedule for these villagers is slightly different. \\"A thematic curriculum, experiential immersion techniques and performance-based assessments are the basis for this academic program.\\" To earn the 180 hours to gain credit at a high school, villagers will attend 4 to 5 structured classes during the day. The credit villagers are in the immersion program and take part in \\"doing\\" foreign language, but unlike many of the 2 week programs, these villagers will also focus on reading and writing. Credit villagers still get to participate in many of the fun activities such as evening programs, sports, arts and crafts and other unique offerings in each village. Programs Concordia Language Villages has offered a 10-day, 4-credit graduate level course for teachers in second languages and immersion, along with various adult programs to serve its diverse audience, not all of which are offered in every language. High school credit abroad programs were formerly offered in China, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Cameroon, and Argentina. During the summer, CLV serves youth with villages in the United States. Villagers can stay for one week, two weeks, or four week programs, and it is possible to earn high school or college credit for the time spent being immersed in the language. Wilderness programs during the summer offer additional opportunities to spend time in the outdoors of Minnesota for those who enjoy the environment, exploration, and camping. Many camps also offer other themed programs, such as French African or Swiss culture (which is a blend of the German, French, and Italian villages) or the Middle Ages in combination with theatre. Summer day camps are offered for younger learners who live in the area, and family week programs during the summer serve entire families, even those with young children. Between September and June, CLV offers weeks and weekends of immersion for adults, families, teachers, and school groups. These programs meet over weekends and long weekends, and each school year has a theme for its weekend. Immediately before the International Day festival closing program, in front of Waldsee's Bahnhof administrative buildingFirst-half closing program performance of El Lago del Bosque, 2008 During each half of the summer, all the camps within driving distance travel to Waldsee, the German camp, for a day-long festival of cultures called International Day, or I-Day. The camps bring out their wares and each has a booth of ethnic food to share, and each camp prepares a short closing performance to share. Each year has a different theme. Additionally, campers in every village learn a choreographed dance to the year's \\"I-Day song\\" during the two weeks preceding I-Day. This is a song from a language not covered by the camps; everyone dances to it together during the festival.

Patronage is an affirmation from the Royal Family of Norway of the quality educational programming of Concordia Language Villages. In 2009, Tove Irene Dahl, the dean of Skogfjorden, was named a Knight of the First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, by His Majesty King Harald V of Norway for the advancement of Norwegian language and culture in the United States. Johannes Rau, former President of the Federal Republic of Germany has also granted personal patronage to Waldsee, the German Language Village. This patronage is symbolic of the strong bonds between the people of Germany and Concordia Language Villages.

Bulkeley, Cd. Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3 Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three (MTBRon 3) was a United States Navy squadron based at Cavite, Philippines, from September 1941 to mid-April 1942. It was commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley and made up of six motor torpedo boats: PT-31, PT-32, PT-33, PT-34, PT-35, and PT-41, the last as the squadron flagship. The other six boats of the squadron remained at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and were there when war broke out, eventually being shipped to the Solomons. After the outbreak of hostilities between the United States and Japan on 7 December 1941, the squadron moved from Cavite to Sisiman Bay\\"Sisiman Cove\\" in Naval references of the time, but now geographically known as \\"Sisiman Bay\\" just to the east of Mariveles. on the Bataan Peninsula with the requisitioned tug Trabajador as tender, where it helped in the defense of Bataan and Corregidor during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. PT-31 and PT-33 were sunk during the battle. The desired practice was for boats to patrol in pairs in the event one PT needed assistance from another. The critical shortage of spares and fuel often prevented such pairing so that one of the small converted patrol yachts, , Perry, or , or one of the two old destroyers, or , were used to accompany a single PT on patrol. On 11 March 1942, the remaining boats of the squadron transported General Douglas MacArthur and several high-ranking officers from Corregidor to Mindanao, an act which earned every member of the squadron the Silver Star. PT-32 was abandoned during this mission, reducing the squadron to three boats: PT-41, PT-34, and PT-35. These three boats were based at Mindanao until mid-April 1942, where two of them (PT-41 and PT-34) attacked the , scoring at least one hit. This was to be the squadron's last action: PT-34 was destroyed by Japanese aircraft, PT-35 had to be scuttled to avoid capture, and PT-41 was commandeered by the U.S. Army to defend Lake Lanao. She was scuttled as well, three days after transfer. Bulkeley and three other officers were later flown to safety on MacArthur's orders, with a fifth officer joining them shortly after. These five officers were all that remained of this squadron as a result. Three officers and fifteen enlisted men were killed in action or died as prisoners of war, seven evaded capture as guerrillas on Leyte, and 38 POWs were liberated after the war. The squadron's exploits were immortalized in the book and film They Were Expendable. Bulkeley was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Philippine Distinguished Conduct Star, and the Silver Star during his command of the squadron, making him one of the most decorated U.S. naval officers of World War II. On 27 July 1942 Motor Torpedo Squadron Two was transferred to MTBRon 3 and was designated MTBRON 3(2). They were commanded by Lcdr. Alan R. Montgomery. In late 1942 the Squadron shipped for Tulagi with six 77' Elco boats and six 80' Elco boats.

Unlike the many Games Workshop games that use miniatures, this is a more traditional counter and board game. The game represents the Second War for Armageddon, a war in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The conflict is between the invading Orks under the leadership of the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka and the Imperial world of Armageddon's defence forces under the joint command of Herman von Strab, Overlord of Armageddon; Commander Dante of the Blood Angels; and Imperial Commissar Yarrick. Concentrating on the Armageddon Secundus region of the planet, the game is a mixture of strategy and resource management. The game draws heavily on World War II Eastern Front sources, with the Orks taking the place of German troops and the Imperium being the Russians. It compares favourably with other Eastern Front counter wargames, emphasising the Germans (Orks) need to secure an early decisive victory otherwise they have to settle for a long drawn out defeat (or draw at the very best) and the hands of the ever increasing Russian (Imperium) forces. The game was originally released as a boxed game, while the expansion, Chaos Attacks focused on the first war for Armageddon that takes place 300 years before Ghazghkull made his first foray into the Armageddon system. Both games were later released for free in pdf format by Games Workshop to promote their 3rd War for Armageddon Warhammer 40,000 campaign. The characters of Ghazghkull and Yarrick were later given rules for use in Warhammer 40,000 and Space Marine.

This Memphis studio was originally a division of a larger corporation, Sam Phillips Recording Service, Inc., which also briefly included under its umbrella a Nashville studio, where famed CBS Records producer Billy Sherrill got his start, and a studio in Tupelo, Mississippi for demos.

It was recorded at Trident Studios, London, England in March 1970, and released in October 1970 in the United Kingdom and January 1971 in the United States. It is a concept album based on country and western/Americana themes. All songs are written by John and Bernie Taupin, with the exception of \\"Love Song\\" by Lesley Duncan. In 2012, Tumbleweed Connection was ranked #458 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album peaked at #2 on the UK Albums Chart and #5 on the US Billboard 200 chart. In the US, it was certified gold in March 1971 and platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA. Background Basic tracks for three of the album's titles, \\"Come Down in Time\\", \\"Country Comfort\\" and \\"Burn Down the Mission\\", were recorded at Trident during the sessions for the previous LP, Elton John, with overdubs completed for Tumbleweed Connection. An early version of \\"Madman Across the Water\\", featuring Mick Ronson on electric guitar, was also recorded during the sessions for the album. It was released on several albums and reissues of Tumbleweed Connection, though the track was ultimately re-recorded for the Madman Across the Water album. Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson appear for the first time together on this album as the rhythm section on \\"Amoreena\\". Olsson had played on one track on Empty Sky for John in 1969. It is Murray's first appearance on an Elton John album. In addition to several studio players who also performed on John's previous self-titled second album, several tracks feature backing musicians from the band Hookfoot, who were also his DJM Records label mates. Hookfoot guitarist Caleb Quaye and drummer Roger Pope had also appeared on John's \\"Empty Sky\\" album. No singles were released from the album in the US by either DJM or John's US distributor, Universal Records, but \\"Country Comfort\\" (b/w \\"Love Song\\") was released as a single in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. = Other versions and Performances = \\"Country Comfort\\" was recorded in 1970 for Gasoline Alley, the second album by Rod Stewart. Stewart also performed the song live with Elton John dressed as a hornet, live at a fund-raising gig at the Vicarage Road Stadium of the Watford Football Club (the Watford Hornets) on 5 May 1974 (Nazareth were the opening act), the same month that Elton John's eighth album, Caribou was released for the price of 1 pound. \\"Come Down in Time\\" was covered by Sting in 1991 for the Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin tribute album. For the same album, Phil Collins recorded \\"Burn Down the Mission\\". \\"Amoreena\\" was used in the opening credits of the 1975 movie \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" directed by Sidney Lumet starring Al Pacino and John Cazale. In 1998, a bootleg CD was released called Tumbleweed Collection. This was a collection of piano demos and live tracks. Australian country singer Keith Urban recorded a cover of \\"Country Comfort\\" on his 2004 album Be Here. Artwork The wraparound cover photo for the album was taken at Sheffield Park railway station in Sussex, approximately south of London on the Bluebell Railway. Photographer Ian Digby Ovens captured John (seated to the right in the photo but appearing to the left on the front cover, shown above) and Taupin (standing to the left, on the back cover) in front of the late-nineteenth-century station, to represent the album's rural Americana concept despite the English location. Additional photos were taken from the interior of a train on the line for the album liner notes and libretto. In August 2020, the Bluebell Railway announced that, to mark the 50th anniversary of the release of the album, it had restored the station to look as it did when the cover photo was taken, giving people an opportunity to re-create the scene in their own photos.  Reception  Tumbleweed Connection Platinum Record The album peaked at #2 on the UK Albums Chart and #5 on the US Billboard 200 chart. In the US, it was certified gold in March 1971 and platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA. In 2012, Tumbleweed Connection was ranked #458 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. = Critical reception = Reviewing for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \\"Half of the songs don't follow conventional pop song structures; instead, they flow between verses and vague choruses. These experiments are remarkably successful, primarily because Taupin's lyrics are evocative and John's melodic sense is at its best.\\" Robert Christgau wrote in his 1981 Record Guide: \\"good melodies and bad Westerns on it. Why do people believe that these latter qualify as songpoems?\\" (Note: There's an earlier Christgau's review of the album, written in 1970 for The Village Voice). Reviewing for Rolling Stone (Deluxe edition), David Fricke wrote: \\"1971‚Äôs Tumbleweed Connection needs no improvement; it is one of the best country-rock albums ever written by London cowboys.\\" Robert Hillburn wrote for Los Angeles Times: \\"Tumbleweed Connection is that near-perfect album that artists often spend a whole career trying to produce.\\" Dave DiMartino wrote for Yahoo!

It holds major collections of American art, decorative arts, contemporary art, and arts of Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the ancient world. Its extensive collections of American art include works by Hiram Powers, Thomas Cole, John Singer Sargent, Albert Bierstadt, Frederick Church, Childe Hassam, Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Joseph Stella, Tony Smith and Frank Stella. The Museum's Tibetan art galleries are considered among the best in the world. The collection was purchased from Christian missionaries in the early twentieth century. The Tibetan galleries have an in-situ Buddhist altar that the Dalai Lama has consecrated. In addition to its extensive art collections, the Newark Museum of Art is dedicated to natural science. It includes the Dreyfuss Planetarium and the Victoria Hall of Science which highlights selections from the museum's 70,000 specimen Natural Science Collection. The Alice Ransom Dreyfuss Memorial Garden, located behind the museum, houses numerous works of contemporary sculpture and is the setting for community programs, concerts and performances. The garden is also home to a 1784 old stone schoolhouse and the Newark Fire Museum. The museum was founded in 1909 by librarian and reformer John Cotton Dana. As the charter described it, the purpose was \\"to establish in the City of Newark, New Jersey, a museum for the reception and exhibition of articles of art, science, history and technology, and for the encouragement of the study of the arts and sciences.\\" The kernel of the museum was a collection of Japanese prints, silks, and porcelains assembled by a Newark pharmacist.Alexander 1995, p. 390. Originally located on the fourth floor of the Newark Public Library, the museum moved into its own purpose-built structure in the 1920s on Washington Park after a gift by Louis Bamberger. It was designed by Jarvis Hunt, who also designed Bamberger's flagship Newark store.Jarvis Hunt Buildings - math.uic.edu - Retrieved July 13, 2008Alexander 1995, p. 399. Since then, the museum has expanded several times, to the south into the red brick former YMCA and to the north into the 1885 Ballantine House, by means of a four-year, $23 million renovation. In 1990, the museum expanded to the west into an existing acquired building. At that time much of the museum, including the new addition, was redesigned by Michael Graves. The museum had a mini-zoo with small animals for some twenty years, until August 2010.The Mini Zoo , Newark Museum website. For the security of climate-sensitive artwork, the museum closed its front entrance to the public in 1997 to minimize the effects of temperature and humidity changes. However, in February 2018, after extensive renovation and the construction of a ramp for disabled access, the front doors were reopened. On November 6, 2019, the museum changed its name to The Newark Museum of Art to highlight the focus of the museum on its art collection which was ranked 12th in the country. The museum is open from 12 to 5 pm from Wednesdays to Sundays and is free for Newark residents. The Newark Black Film Festival is held every summer at the museum. The Ballantine House The Ballantine house is a preserved and restored house from the Victorian Era, designed by architect George Edward Harney. It was home to John Holme Ballantine, his wife, Jeannette, and their children, John, Robert, Alice, and Percy. Mr. Ballantine owned and ran a brewery in the Ironbound section of Newark. The house originally had twenty-seven rooms and three floors. In 1937, the Newark Museum bought the house and has since restored it to serve as galleries for the extensive decorative arts collections. MakerSPACE at Newark Museum The MakerSPACE at the Newark Museum is \\"an interactive area where visitors of all ages play, tinker and create as they make connections between the materials, processes and concepts of artwork and natural science objects in the Museum‚Äôs collections and their own creativity.\\" John Cotton Dana, the founder of the museum, believed that \\"the worth of a museum is in its use.\\" The museum has carried on this legacy of incorporation of the immediate community by opening a MakerSPACE. The museum even displays some of the artwork that is made in the space. The space includes many advanced tools, such as a laser cutter/engraver, 3D printers, a vinyl cutter, pottery wheels, sewing machines, relief and silk screen printing equipment, and various hand tools like saws, hammers, and screwdrivers. The MakerSPACE is open every Saturday 1-4PM for drop-in activities.

It was founded in 1855 as the Band of Hope. Band of Hope In 1847 at a meeting on these premises the \\"Band of Hope\\" Movement was formed. Its title being suggested by the Reverend Jabez Tunnicliff, a prominent Leeds temperance worker. Band of Hope Member's Card 1870 The Band of Hope was first proposed by Rev. Jabez Tunnicliff, who was a Baptist minister in Leeds, following the death in June 1847 of a young man whose life was cut short by alcohol.H Marles, The Life and Labours of Rev Jabez Tunnicliff, 1865, pp. 213‚Äì210. While working in Leeds, Tunnicliff had become an advocate for total abstinence from alcohol. In the autumn of 1847, with the help of other temperance workers including Anne Jane Carlile, the Band of Hope was founded. Its objective was to teach children the importance and principles of sobriety and teetotalism. In 1855, a national organisation was formed amidst an explosion of Band of Hope work. Meetings were held in churches throughout the UK and included Christian teaching. Set up in an era when alcoholic drinks was generally viewed as a necessity of life, next only to food and water, the Band of Hope and other temperance organisations fought to counteract the influence of pubs and brewers, with the specific intention of rescuing 'unfortunates' whose lives had been blighted by drink and teach complete abstinence. Christians and Temperance Societies saw this as a way of providing activities for children that encouraged them to avoid alcohol problems. Alcohol-free premises were established, rallies, marches and demonstrations were mounted to oppose the \\"evils\\" of hard liquor that were attended by thousands of supporters, and coffee taverns were established to keep teetotalers on the straight and narrow path. \\"Signing the pledge\\" was one of the innovative features. The pledge was a promise not to drink alcohol and millions of people signed up. There were also lectures that were illustrated by magic lantern, the technological equivalent to present day computerised PowerPoint displays, and noted personalities were invited to speak at public meetings in support of the cause. Guy Aldred, the boy preacher was an active propagandist for the Band of Hope, before focussing his activities on Anarchist-Communist politics. Building on Bridge End, next to Leeds Bridge, Leeds, in which the Band of Hope was founded in 1847. In 1887 the movement had about 1¬Ω million members out of 8 million young people in Britain of Band of Hope age. By 1891 it had 2 million members and in 1897, Queen Victoria's Jubilee year, the estimated membership was 3,238,323. Band of Hope also had chapters in Australia prior to World War I. By the early 1950s, however, the temperance movement had all but succumbed to a changing society and cultural habits. Lack of support for the Band of Hope eventually brought about their transformation into Hope UK. Hope UK remains concerned with children's welfare, giving priority to the development of resources and training for parents and children's workers of many kinds. The charity also attempts to persuade churches and other Christian organisations to include drugs awareness work within their programmes and play their part in helping to reduce the UK's alcohol and other drugs problems. Hope UK is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).Full list of NCVYS members Training The charity provides training courses across the UK, ranging from short workshops to two-day Open College Network (OCN) accredited courses. Hope UK's drug educators undergo a 120-hour OCN accredited course to prepare them for leading drug awareness sessions and training courses. This course is also available for those who want to provide drug education as part of their own work. The charity provides a two-day OCN- accredited \\"Young People, Drugs and the Role of the Youth Worker\\" course for people that work with children and young people. It also provides \\"Drug Prevention for Family Workers\\", a two-day course for those working in family centres, with parents, or for Children's or Community Development workers.

He served as a retainer to the Oda clan, and was eventually a daimy≈ç in his own right. Biography Nagahide was born in what is now Nishi-ku, Nagoya, but then part of Aichi District, Owari Province. From his youth, Nagahide served Oda Nobunaga and became one of his senior retainers, going on to fight in the Oda clan's major battles, including Anegawa in 1570, Nagashino in 1575, the Honganji Campaign from 1570-1580, Tedorigawa in 1577, and the Second Invasion of Iga in 1581 and was named one of the administrators of Kyoto after Nobunaga entered that city in 1568. He stayed by Nobunaga's side when his brother defied him during the Battle of In≈ç. Nagahide also had military service during the Battle of Okehazama, but he wasn't a part of the main strike force. During the Battle of Kannonji Castle, he contributed in the conquest of ≈åmi Province and was a part of Nobunaga's personal formation. His participation made him favored by his master. According to the Nobunaga K≈çki, he also served in the Mino campaign against Sait≈ç Tatsuoki, the Ikko-ikki campaign, Nobunaga's Kyushu campaign, and the Battle of Nagashino, he also fought in the Battle of Tedorigawa under Shibata Katsuie against Uesugi Kenshin. When he wasn't in battle, he was aiding Nobunaga's conquests by taking care of political affairs and was the building magistrate for Azuchi castle. One of the characters of his family name was said to have been granted for the Hashiba name for Hideyoshi. His participation made him favored by Nobunaga, among many of other deeds. The extent of Nobunaga's trust can be seen by the fact that Nagahide married Nobunaga's niece, while his son was Niwa Nagashige. These services let Nagahide rule over the fief of Obama in Wakasa Province, and Sawayama Castle in ≈åmi Province. In 1581, in a military parade held at Kyoto before the eyes of the Emperor as well as foreign missionaries, Nagahide was given the honor of leading the procession. In the same year, he fought in second Tensho Iga War against Iga inhabitants. In 1582, as Oda Nobutaka's second in command, Nagahide launched a campaign on Shikoku; but before he made any progress, Nobunaga died during an attack by Akechi Mitsuhide. Nagahide abandoned the campaign and turned back to help Hashiba Hideyoshi avenge this by killing Mitsuhide at Battle of Yamazaki. In 1583 at the subsequent meeting in Kiyosu Castle where the future of the Oda clan was discussed, Nagahide supported Hideyoshi's position, He also assisted Hideyoshi at the Battle of Shizugatake and gained Echizen Province and Kaga Province to rule, worth over 1,230,000 koku. He thus became one of the most powerful retainers and daimy≈ç. Niwa Nagahide battle standard Death However, Nagahide died of illness in 1585 without making any impact at all. There is a conflicting record that Nagahide had not died of an illness, but on seeing Hideyoshi gather more power and eclipsing the Oda clan Nagahide had so long served, he felt that he had not lived up for the good of Nobunaga and the Oda clan as whole and committed suicide. His son Niwa Nagashige later became lord of Shirakawa Castle in northern Japan, and by the time of Nagahide's grandson Mitsushige, the family's 100,000 koku landholding was moved to Nihonmatsu, where they remained for the duration of the Edo Period.

Jinhan was one of the Samhan (or \\"Three Hans\\"), along with Byeonhan and Mahan. Apparently descending from the Jin state of southern Korea, Jinhan was absorbed by the later Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. History Jinhan, like the other Samhan confederacies, arose out of the confusion and migration following the fall of Wiman Joseon in 108 BC. Culture Its relation to the earlier state of Jin is not clear, although the contemporary Chinese chronicle San Guo Zhi alleges that Jinhan was identical with Jin (while another record describes Jin as the predecessor of the Samhan as a whole). Jinhan and Byeonhan shared essentially the same culture, with varying religious customs, and apparently were not separated by a clear boundary. The people claimed they were descendants of Qin dynasty migrants, fleeing Qin's force labor policies moved to the Mahan confederacy which give them the east land. The confederacy was also called Qinhan (Áß¶Èüì). As immigrants, the kings might be Mahan people according to most historical books of China and Korea. \\"According to the Samguksagi entry for the 38th year of King Bak Hyeogeose of Silla, it is claimed that refugees from Qin settled in Jinhan, that is south-eastern Korea.\\" In Vol 30 of Book of Wei, Biographies of Jinhan, Records of the Three Kingdoms, there is a description ‚ÄúÂêçÂúãÁÇ∫ÈÇ¶ (means they call Guo,Âúã as Bang,ÈÇ¶). It is said that people of Jinhan came from Qin, the first emperor of Han Liu Bang (Hanja: ÂäâÈÇ¶) hesitate to use same Chinese character Bang (Hanja: ÈÇ¶) to refer country, so he changed Bang (Hanja: ÈÇ¶) to Guo (Hanja: Âúã). So after Han, people use Guo (Hanja: Âúã) instead of Bang (Hanja: ÈÇ¶), but Jinhan people use Bang (Hanja: ÈÇ¶)‚Äù it means it is certain that they are using Qin language.‰ºäËó§Ëã±‰∫∫„ÄåÊúùÈÆÆÂçäÂ≥∂„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãË®ÄË™ûÊé•Ëß¶„ÄçTokyo University of Foreign StudiesË™ûÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄË´ñÈõÜ„ÄÅÁ¨¨18Âè∑„ÄÅp58 The Samguk Sagi and History of the Northern Dynasties say that the originally Lelang Commandery area which later became the area of Jinhan confederacy was the origin of Silla.

According to Samguk Sagi, the Silla Kingdom (around present-day Gyeongju), was founded by Bak Hyeokgeose in 57 BC, who united the six clans of Jinhan under his rule. The records are sparse and conflicting regarding the relationship of the names Jinhan, Saro, Seorabeol, and the later Silla kingdom. We know little of the daily life of Jinhan people. The religion appears to have been shamanistic, and to have played an important role in politics as well. Agriculture was heavily dominated by rice, but also included substantial rearing of livestock including horses, cattle, and chickens. Location Most theories indicate that Jinhan was located in the area later occupied by the Silla kingdom: the Gyeongju Basin and adjacent Sea of Japan coast. It would have been neighbored by the Byeonhan confederacy on the southwest, and by the much larger Mahan confederacy on the west. On the north it would have been bounded by the Chinese commanderies and the small coastal state of Dongye. However, some scholars place Jinhan in the Han River valley, bounded by Mahan on the north and Byeonhan on the south.

Eastman is also the editor and publisher of the magazine Heavy Metal. Early life and career Eastman was born in Portland, Maine. He attended Westbrook High School in Westbrook, Maine, with comic book illustrator Steve Lavigne. Kevin was \\"raised in a Christian family\\", and grew up a comic book fan, with Jack Kirby as his idol and Kamandi as his favorite title of his.My Superhero, Jack Kirby. By Kevin Eastman In 1983 he worked in a restaurant while he searched for publishers for his comics. He met a waitress who was attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst and followed her to Northampton, Massachusetts. While searching for a local underground newspaper to publish his work, he began a professional relationship with Peter Laird, who worked at nearby Dover, New Hampshire, and the two collaborated for a short time on various comics projects.Wiater, Stanley & Bissette, Stephen R. (ed.s) Comic Book Rebels: Conversations with the Creators of the New Comics (Donald I. Fine, Inc. 1993) In May 1984, Eastman and Laird self-published the first black & white issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The forty-page oversized comic had an initial print run of 3,275 copies and was largely funded by a US$1000 loan from Eastman's uncle Quentin. It was published by the duo's Mirage Studios, a name chosen because, as Eastman says, \\"there wasn't an actual studio, only kitchen tables and couches with lap boards.\\"Bob Burden's Mysterymen Presskit: Kevin Eastman.

Accessed April 22, 2008 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Laird's newspaper experience led to the two creating a four-page press kit,Pages from the Press Kit can be seen here on Eastman's Heavy Metal website. which included a story outline and artwork. They sent the press kit to 180 television and radio stations as well as to the Associated Press and United Press International. This led to widespread press coverage of both the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Mirage Studios itself, creating a demand for the comic. With their second issue, Eastman and Laird's Turtles comic began a quick rise to success, bringing in advance orders of 15,000 copies, five times the initial print run of the first issue. This earned Eastman and Laird a profit of $2,000 each and allowed them to become full-time comic book creators. The Turtles phenomenon saw the duo invited to their first comics convention at the tenth annual Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1984, where they mingled with notable comic creators like Larry Niven, Forrest J Ackerman and Fred Hembeck. Their fifth issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was released in November 1985, and was downsized to the more common American comics-format and size. The previous four issues were also reprinted in this size and format with new colored covers. Also in 1985, Solson Publications released How to Draw Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Solson would follow this up with the six-issue Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Authorized Martial Arts Training Manual as well as one issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teach Karate volume in 1987. =Licensing= Mirage's Turtles comic led to a widening media presence for the heroes. Eastman and Laird began to widely merchandise their property. Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15 lead figurines for role-playing gamers and collectors, Palladium Books produced a role-playing game featuring the Turtles, and First Comics reprinted in four volumes the first eleven issues as color trade paperback collections. Palladium's role-playing game brought the Turtles to the attention of licensing agent Mark Freedman and the Turtles phenomenon took off, with the various characters soon appearing on T-shirts, Halloween masks, mugs, and other paraphernalia.Don Markstein's Toonopedia: \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\". Accessed April 22, 2008 A five-part televised cartoon mini-series based on the Turtles debuted in December 1987.IMDb: \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" (1987) (mini). Accessed April 22, 2008 The half-hour episodes were produced by Osamu Yoshioka and the animation was directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai from scripts David Wise and Patti Howeth. The mini-series was successful, leading to a full series, with the mini-series forming the first season. The series had a 9-year, 10-season, 193-episode run. Bob Burden writes: In January 1988, Eastman and Laird visited Playmates Toys, who wished to market action figures based on the comic book and animated cartoon series, further cementing the Turtles' place in history and making Eastman and Laird extremely successful. =Multimedia= Multiple other Turtles comics, toys, books, games, and other merchandising items have subsequently appeared, overseen and sometimes fully created by Eastman and Laird. Among these are five live-action films: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016), with Eastman making a brief cameo in the latter. Four more television series were also created: Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (1997), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012), in which Eastman wrote the fifth season episode \\"Lone Rat and Cubs\\", and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There was also an animated feature film, TMNT (2007). =Eastman & Laird: Parting ways= Creative differences began to strain Eastman and Laird's partnership. In an interview in 2002, Laird noted that the two hadn't spent much time together since 1993. Eastman moved to California while Laird stayed in Massachusetts. On June 1, 2000 Laird and the Mirage Group purchased Eastman's ownership in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property and corporations. Eastman wanted to move on to other projects. The buyout was completed on March 1, 2008.the 5th turtle: A final release In 2011, Eastman began working with the TMNT series again as a writer and artist on the IDW comic series, as well as an adviser on the 2014 reboot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film series. Eastman is said to have a cameo in the film as a doctor, and has voiced the character Ice Cream Kitty in the 2012 CGI series. In December 2019, issue #100 of IDW Publishing's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic series featured a teaser ad for an upcoming comic project titled The Last Ronin in which the prospect of a possible reunion and cooperation between Eastman and Laird was held out.\\"City at War: The End\\".

Eastman decided to address this problem by using his own personal knowledge and connections to help other creators. Approaching Laird with his ideas, Eastman was met with a less than positive response: =Intentions and output= Eastman founded Tundra Publishing in 1990, to realize personal and other projects. He joined with other comic creators like Scott McCloud and Dave Sim to form the Creator's Bill of Rights. Eastman felt obligated to expand it beyond theory and into practice, providing a forum for comics creators to work for a publisher while maintaining ownership of their work. Rick Veitch has written that: Moreover, Eastman provided a forum for Marvel and DC creators to work on projects that they could not otherwise realize: Projects (partly) realized by Tundra included: Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz's Big Numbers, Moore & Eddie Campbell's From Hell, Moore & Melinda Gebbie's Lost Girls (these last two original serialised in Stephen R. Bissette's Taboo anthology, which was also part-published by Tundra),From Hell would continue to be published by Kitchen Sink Press after Tundra's demise, and both From Hell and Lost Girls are now published by Top Shelf Comix. The Crow, Mike Allred's Madman and Dave McKean's Cages, and others.\\"Talking to Kevin Eastman 1: Turtle Days, Turtle Nights\\" by Benjamin Ong Pang Kean, August 31, 2007. Accessed September 25, 2013 Eastman initially thought that his experience at Mirage gave him \\"a pretty good grasp of what a publisher should be, and what a publisher needs to do,\\" although he swiftly realized that \\"Tundra was not like publishing the Turtles.\\" =Difficulties= As part of Eastman's designs for Tundra were to produce personal projects of a more adult nature than the Turtles-oriented Mirage was geared towards,Eastman notes, that the initial black and white comic was considerably more 'adult' than what followed. this saw Tundra fitting in the dubious middle-ground, as their intended product sat somewhat awkwardly between the comic shop and the book shop. Eastman says that he \\"thought that the audience was a lot larger than it actually was,\\" citing his personal assumption that readers would \\"grow up through X-Men and discover The Sandman and then Dark Knight and Watchmen and beyond.\\" The relatively new in-roads of comics and graphic novels into bookshops worked against Tundra at the time. Eastman swiftly became aware that Tundra and the Turtles differed considerably, not least since the latter was successful enough to effectively run itself, with a few 'nudges' \\"to keep it moving along.\\" Tundra, on the other hand, dealt in new properties, which required \\"building from the ground up,\\" and was \\"a lot more work\\" than Eastman had anticipated, growing far too quickly for comfort, and requiring considerable injections of time and money, rather than being profitable. Speaking in 1992/93, Eastman was optimistic that the company had \\"finally reached the point where [it had] slowed up enough... to be giving individual projects the time and attention they require[d];\\" Shortly thereafter, Tundra was bought out by Kitchen Sink Press, closing its (solo) doors after just three years, losing Eastman between $9 and $14 million. =Aftermath= Despite heavy financial losses, Eastman remains philosophical about his work with Tundra, drawing the analogy that: He makes mention of the multiple award nominations Tundra received during its first and second years, including Harvey Awards and Eisner Awards, but notes that despite critical acclaim, the company was not making money on its titles, and had to cease production. He notes that Tundra was one of the earlier creator-owned companies, \\"before Image really took off\\" and before Dark Horse Comics' \\"Legends line.\\" Eastman admits that Tundra tried to do too much too quickly, and ran into difficulties accordingly. He also suggests that \\"[n]ot one book made any money\\". He also believes that part of Tundra's downfall was tied to his offering Marvel and DC employees the chance to work on creator-owned and personal projects. He has stated in interviews that: Heavy Metal Kevin Eastman has been a longtime fan of the science fiction and fantasy magazine, much of whose content was translated from the French, and appeared in the original M√©tal Hurlant publication of which Heavy Metal is only the American-licensed incarnation. He cites the publication as bringing Richard Corben to his attention as the \\"second greatest influence\\" on him as an artist, after Jack Kirby. He saw in its pages European art which had not been previously seen in the United States, as well as an underground comix sensibility that nonetheless \\"wasn't as harsh or extreme as some of the underground comix ‚Äì but... definitely intended for an older readership.\\" Discovering Heavy Metal had been put up for sale, and with one of Tundra's stated aims, to bring a more adult sensibility (and mature, adult readers) to comics, overlapping with the magazine's target audience, Eastman decided that Heavy Metal was \\"the final piece of the puzzle\\", and looked into purchasing it. Noting that: Eastman purchased the magazine in January 1992. Despite the audiences for Heavy Metal and Tundra's intended product (as well as more mature-themed comics in general) being of a broadly similar demographic, Eastman recognized from the start that \\"most of the audience who read Heavy Metal buy it off the newsstands; they're not going into comic book stores,\\" and stated early on that his intention was to produce \\"numerous crossovers from the cutting edge of comics creators\\" to expose the magazine's readership not just to the comics industry, \\"but anything from the visual media that can cross over.\\" Eastman also attempted to bring some European hardcover comics to America, using Heavy Metal to help serialize them and both defray the costs and boost readership. Initial interest, however, was \\"fairly cool.\\" Eastman sold the magazine to digital and music veteran David Boxenbaum and film producer Jeff Krelitz in January 2014. Eastman will continue to serve as publisher of the magazine, and is a minority investor in the new Heavy Metal.https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/heavy-metal-magazine- new-owner-hollywood-plans-1201062182/ Art collection Eastman purchased his first piece of original artwork (\\"a couple of pages that were penciled by Michael Golden and inked by Bob McLeod for Marvel Comics' Howard the Duck\\") at the Atlanta Fantasy Fair, the convention he and Laird attended in 1984.

The lake has a surface area of about at capacity, and the length is about . The word Sacandaga means \\"Land of the Waving Grass\\" in the local native language. The lake is located in the northern parts of Fulton County and Saratoga County near the southern border of the Adirondack Park. A small portion also extends northward into southern Hamilton County. The broader, south end of the lake is northeast of the City of Johnstown and the City of Gloversville. Great Sacandaga Lake is a reservoir created by damming the Sacandaga River. The primary purpose for the creation of the reservoir was to control flooding on the Hudson River and the Sacandaga River, floods which had a historically significant impact on the surrounding communities. History Damming the Sacandaga River had been proposed repeatedly throughout the late 19th century. Only after several large floods impacted downstream communities, such as the city of Albany, was there a serious and concerted effort by the state to explore flood control. A public benefit corporation was established to study the feasibility of the dam and later adopted a resolution proposing the dam in 1924. Construction began in the 1920s and completed in March 1930, at a cost of $12 million.: History of Sacandaga Reservoir The dam was constructed at Conklingville in the Town of Day, Saratoga County. 4 covered bridges and a steel railroad bridge were removed or destroyed. A new bridge consisting of 21 steel spans was constructed at Batchellerville. This 1930 bridge was replaced in 2012. Land speculation flourished as the plan to control the river and flood a large expanse of land leaked out. Many people chose to remove houses and buildings to new sites outside of the flood zone. Many isolated farms were flooded as well as all or part of ten communities (Batchellerville, Fish House, Osborne Bridge, The Vly, Cranberry Creek, Sacandaga Park, Town of Day, Conklingville, Munsonville and Benedict). 1100 people were forced out of their homes and twenty four cemeteries holding 3,872 graves were moved. Anything left behind as the dam neared completion was burned. The new body of water was initially called a \\"reservoir,\\" but in the 1960s it was renamed the Great Sacandaga Lake in an effort to promote tourism to the area. The reservoir is managed by the Hudson River-Black River Regulating District. Today, the local businesses benefit not only from the flood protection provided by the lake, but also from the tourist attraction and the resulting economy that the lake has created in the area. People not only come from many local cities and towns to visit the lake for recreation, but also from other areas of the state, New England, and New Jersey. Many local and out-of-state residents are not only visitors, but also come to the lake to stay in their summer camps and second homes. Public access to the lake is via the many public boat launches, public beaches, and campgrounds that are located on the shores of the lake. The \\"I GO INN\\" Restaurant is the oldest continually running establishment in the Sacandaga region. Although the lake and some lands surrounding it are owned by New York State, no public money is used to manage the reservoir. Approximately 70% of the District's revenues come from lease agreements with electrical power companies who run the hydroelectric turbines in the dam.

Created by writer Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, he first appeared in The Avengers #9 (October 1964). The character, who was initially introduced as a supervillain imbued with \\"ionic\\" energy, fought the Avengers and after a series of events, he was reborn as a superhero joining the team he originally fought against. In 2012, Wonder Man was ranked 38th in IGN's list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\". Publication history Wonder Man debuted in the superhero-team title The Avengers #9 (cover-dated Oct. 1964), but appeared to die in that issue. Four years later, Avengers #58 (Nov. 1968) revisited the events of #9, explaining that the Avengers had electronically saved Wonder Man's mind in a computer. Wonder Man was not seen again until The Avengers #102 (Aug. 1972), where he made a cameo appearance in a comatose state. Wonder Man's body is revived by the villain Kang in The Avengers #131-132 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 1975), and then again by the Black Talon in The Avengers #152 (Oct. 1976), and finally by the Living Laser in The Avengers Annual #6 (1976). After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovers his faculties and joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity in Avengers #160 (June 1977). Wonder Man and his fellow Avenger the Beast were cast as buddies and lovers of nightlife, which would become a fan-favorite dynamic of The Avengers and continue to be used after the two characters left the series. Marvel Comics' then-publisher Stan Lee said in 1978, \\"You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and [DC Comics] sued us because they had Wonder Woman, and... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got Power Girl [after Marvel had introduced Power Man]. Oh, boy. How unfair.\\" Wonder Man later appeared as a founding member of the spin- off West Coast Avengers first in a four-issue miniseries (Sept.-Dec. 1984), and continuing as one of the primary characters in the series' 102-issue run. After that team disbanded, he joined the team Force Works in a series that debuted with a July 1994 cover-date. After that team splintered, Wonder Man rejoined the Avengers in The Avengers vol. 3, #4 (May 1998). After the collapse of the team in The Avengers #503 (Dec. 2004), Wonder Man joined a new splinter group called the Mighty Avengers, co-starred in that team's series, which premiered with March 2007 cover-date. Wonder Man starred in a self- titled graphic novel in 1986. He then starred in a 29-issue series, Wonder Man (Sept. 1991 ‚Äì Feb. 1994), which was followed in by the three-issue miniseries Avengers Two: Wonder Man and the Beast (2000). In 2007, he starred in the five-issue miniseries Wonder Man: My Fair Super Hero. Wonder Man appeared sporadically throughout the 2010-2013 Avengers series, but played an important role in the \\"End Times\\" storyline in issue #31 (December 2012) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). Comic book writer Rick Remender revealed in an interview that Wonder Man would be a member of the Uncanny Avengers, starting with issue #5. Fictional character biography Simon Williams is the son of rich industrialist Sanford Williams, owner of Williams Innovations. Simon inherits the munitions factory after his father's death, but the company's profits fall due to its biggest competitor Tony Stark and his company Stark Industries. On the advice of his brother Eric, Simon tries to embezzle funds from his company but is caught and incarcerated. Simon blames Stark for this and accepts the proposition of master villain Baron Heinrich Zemo after the Enchantress pays his bail, as a pawn is required to infiltrate the Avengers. The desperate Simon Williams agrees and is transformed into an ion-powered being with superhuman powers. His powers are tested, and he is shown to have great superhuman strength and durability, even defeating the Executioner. Called Wonder Man by Zemo, he is then sent to meet and join the Avengers, with instructions to betray them at a critical moment so that Zemo's Masters of Evil can destroy the Avengers. Zemo ensures Wonder Man's loyalty by advising him that as a result of the treatment his body now requires periodic doses of a serum to survive‚Äîa serum that only Zemo can provide. The Avengers are lured into a trap and captured. The plan fails when Wonder Man decides to save the Avengers and aid them against Zemo, apparently at the cost of his own life.

Actual school uniforms vary widely by location and individual school. In contrast to most schools in the United States, almost all Catholic schools in that country have some form of dress code, and most of them (especially those with students in the lower grade levels) have a mandatory uniform policy. The concept is not easily transposed to other countries. In most Commonwealth countries, school uniforms (often similar to the \\"Catholic school uniform\\" stereotype in the United States) are common in all types of schools, whether sectarian or not and regardless of religious denomination. Purpose of school uniforms The stated purpose of uniforms, often set forth in school uniform policies, include reducing clothing expenditures for parents as well as avoiding distinctions among children based on whose parents can afford to buy them fashionable clothing to wear to school. The school attire is also said to reduce distractions and help with student identification, ensuring that a stranger will stand out among the uniformed students. Several examples of Catholic school uniform skirts showing the plaid patterns. In North America Until the early to mid-1970s, the uniform for girls almost always consisted of a skirt or jumper; but it is now common, in the United States, for female pupils to wear uniform shorts or slacks, depending on the weather. This is mainly the result of changing societal norms that, beginning in the late 1960s to early 1970s, resulted in a trend for women and girls in most levels of society to wear trousers and shorts, instead of skirts and dresses, for everyday life. Today, most schools require girls to wear skirts, while others allow girls the choice of skirts or culottes and pants including ankle pants that stop at or just a little above the ankle. A kilted skirt is sometimes worn, especially in schools with predominantly Celtic student populations. In some parts of Canada, the skirt has been modified to include an attached pair of shorts beneath, for modesty called a skort. Bike shorts or Leggings are often worn under girls' skirts or jumpers for modesty and to prevent individuals from looking under the girl's skirt or dress. The leggings can be ankle length or capri length with crew or knee-high socks worn over the ankle leggings. Culottes or ankle pants that stop at or just above the ankle are also sometimes substituted for a skirt, especially at non-parochial private schools; however, for special events, the skirt is usually still worn. Students in preschool and, less frequently, kindergarten, are held to be more likely to engage in messy activities. As such, they may be asked to wear their school's physical education uniform as their regular uniform. Younger girls are often seen wearing plaid jumpers over a blouse under their skirts. Many schools require a jumper up to the fourth, fifth, or sixth grade, presumably because the lifestyles and habits of younger girls may make blouses more likely to become untucked from skirt or culotte waistbands. After that, the jumper is often discarded in favor of a plaid skirt with bike shorts, capri or ankle length leggings, with crew or knee socks over the ankle leggings, tights or culottes and blouse or polo depending on the weather and season. Often the skirt and blouse or polo must be worn with a sweater or sweater vest, or the polo is worn by itself or with a layering long-sleeved tee underneath or with the polo worn underneath a sweater or sweatshirt with the polo collar turned over the sweater or sweatshirt collar so it's visible. Boys typically wear a collared shirt, tie, and slacks of required colors, although polo shirts have to some extent replaced dress shirt. In the winter colder months the polo is seen worn with a layered long-sleeved tee underneath or a sweatshirt or sweater over the polo with the collar of the polo folded over the collar of the sweatshirt or sweater so it's visible. Both sexes usually wear a sweater or blazer (or both) or polo with a layered long-sleeved tee underneath or a sweatshirt or sweater over the polo with the collar of the polo folded over the collar of the sweatshirt sweater so the polo collar is visible when required by regulations or weather. Some schools have unisex uniforms‚Äîmost often a distinctive shirt, and sometimes pants of a given color. They may also require that a specially-designated, more formal uniform be worn on liturgy days or other special occasions. Uniforms may vary based on time of year. At many schools, students are excused from having to wear the fairly formal (and warm) uniforms described above during the hotter months of the school year in favor of lighter uniform clothing such as skorts, skirts, or shorts worn with knee socks, crew socks, quarter socks, or triple roll socks, or capri leggings under the skirt and capri pants are also worn. However, at some schools appearance and formality prevail over comfort and students must suffer through the warm weather in their full uniform, which can include long-sleeved dress shirts, ties, wool sweaters, blazers, wool skirts or jumpers, leggings and tights. In many schools ballet flats for girls and Sperry Top-Siders for both girls and boys have become popular and acceptable footwear with the uniforms. Scrunchies, headbands or headwrap style headbands are usually worn in school colors and patterns.

Advances in technology have allowed people to travel farther, explore more territory, and expand their influence over larger and larger areas. Even in ancient times, new tools such as foot coverings, skis, and snowshoes lengthened the distances that could be traveled. As new inventions and discoveries were applied to transport problems, travel time decreased while the ability to move more and larger loads increased. Innovation continues as transport researchers are working to find new ways to reduce costs and increase transport efficiency. International trade was the driving motivator behind advancements in global transportation in the Pre Modern world. \\"...there was a single global world economy with a worldwide division of labor and multilateral trade from 1500 onward.\\" The sale and transportation of Textile, silver and gold, spices, slaves and luxury goods throughout Afro- Eurasia and later the New World would see an evolution in overland and sea trade routes and travel  Land  = Road = Bronocice pot with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world. Modes of road transport in Dublin, 1929 The first earth tracks were created by humans carrying goods and often followed trails. Tracks would be naturally created at points of high traffic density. As animals were domesticated, horses, oxen and donkeys became an element in track-creation. With the growth of trade, tracks were often flattened or widened to accommodate animal traffic. Later, the travois, a frame used to drag loads, was developed. Animal-drawn wheeled vehicles were probably developed in the Ancient Near East in the 4th or 5th millennium BC and spread to Europe and India in the 4th millennium BC and China in about 1200 BC. The Romans had a significant need for good roads to extend and maintain their empire and developed Roman roads. In the Industrial Revolution, John Loudon McAdam (1756‚Äì1836) designed the first modern highways, using inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (macadam), and the embanked roads a few feet higher than the surrounding terrain to cause water to drain away from the surface. With the development of motor transport there was an increased need for hard-topped roads to reduce washaways, bogging and dust on both urban and rural roads, originally using cobblestones and wooden paving in major western cities and in the early 20th century tar-bound macadam (tarmac) and concrete paving. In 1902, Nottingham's Radcliffe Road became the first tarmac road in the world. = Rail = Stockton Darlington steam locomotive Railway construction 1820 Liverpool and Manchester steam locomotive Railway opening (1830) The history of rail transportation dates back nearly 500 years and includes systems with man or horsepower and rails of wood (or occasionally stone). This was usually for moving coal from the mine down to a river, from where it could continue by boat, with a flanged wheel running on a rail. The use of cast iron plates as rails began in the 1760s, and was followed by systems (plateways) where the flange was part of the rail. However, with the introduction of rolled wrought iron rails, these became obsolete. The first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway at Oyster mouth in 1807, using horse-drawn carriages on existing tramlines. In 1802, Richard Trevithick designed and built the first (unnamed) steam locomotive to run on smooth rails. He was a Cornish engineer and showed off his railway invention in the Welsh mining town of Merthyr Tydfil. Before actual making the breakthrough for the first railway engine, Trevithick had been facing failures and successes along the route. One of his first successful demonstrations was the \\"Puffing Devil\\" steam powered locomotive in 1802 whereas a disaster in Greenwich in 1803 almost sealed the fate of locomotive travel, when four men were killed by an explosion of one of Trevithick's engines. This incident was used as a leverage by his rivals to stop the production of the high-pressure steam engines. However, Trevithick's \\"Penydarren locomotive\\", marked its place in history by becoming the first full scale working railway steam locomotive. A bet between Trevithick's benefactor Samuel Homfray and Richard Crawshay prompted the key demonstration of the locomotive. Homfray had placed a wager of 500 guineas that the locomotive will transport ten tonnes of iron from the Pendydarren Ironworks to the village of Abercynon which was nearly ten miles away. Trevithick's locomotive completed the journey in just over 4 hours, ultimately proving the locomotives sturdiness and reliability However Trevithick never got the credit hen deserved and died a destitute in 1833. Modern locomotive Modern rail transport systems first appeared in England in the 1820s. Matthew Murray proved the viability of the steam engine in 1812. Salamanca was the first the locomotive to incorporate two cylinders. George Stephenson who went on to become known as the father of railways is said to have built 16 experimental locomotives for use from the year 1814- 1826, the last train which he introduced known as the Killingworth Billy ran until 1881. The first intercity railway between Liverpool and Manchester was built by Stephenson in 1830. These systems, which made use of the steam locomotive, were the first practical form of mechanized land transport, and they remained the primary form of mechanized land transport for the next 100 years. The first railroad built in Great Britain was the Stockton and Darlington, opened in 1825. It used a steam locomotive built by George Stephenson and was practical only for hauling minerals. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830, was the first modern railroad. It was a public carrier of both passengers and freight. By 1870 Britain had about 13,500 miles (21,700 km) of railroad. In 1879, electric locomotive development was booming in Germany. In the late 19th century Werner von Siemens demonstrated the first experimental electric passenger train.The train transported around 90,000 people and worked on the concept of insulated third rail to supply electricity. In 1881, Siemens built the world's first electric tram line in the Berlin suburb of Lichterfelde. Following this trend many such initiatives were setup in Brighton and Vienna in 1883. = Diesel Locomotives = A new type of railway locomotives was developed by Dr. Rudolf Diesel which involved a new internal combustion method to propel the railway.In 1892, he proposed this method and soon sparked speculation on whether this type of engine would actually work.From the late 19th century to the early 20th century Rudolf Diesel worked on putting diesel on track and tried to improve the power-to-weight ratio. He worked at a Swiss engineering firm Sulzer. Eventually by the end of the Second World War, steam engines became obsolete and were rarely used in developed countries. At the system's greatest extent, in 1914, there were about 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of the track, run by 120 competing companies. The British government combined all these companies into four main groups in 1923 as an economy measure. British Railways, by name British Rail, former national railway system of Great Britain, created by the Transport Act of 1947, which inaugurated public ownership of the railways. The history of rail transport also includes the history of rapid transit and arguably history of monorail.  Water  A traditional Polynesian catamaran in 1778 CE In the Stone Ages primitive boats developed to permit navigation of rivers and for fishing in rivers and off the coast. It has been argued that boats suitable for a significant sea crossing were necessary for people to reach Australia an estimated 40,000-45,000 years ago. With the development of civilization, vessels evolved for expansion and generally grew in size for trade and war. In the Mediterranean, galleys were developed about 3000 BC. Polynesian double-hulled sailing vessels with advanced rigging were used between 1,300 BC and 900 BC by the Polynesian progeny of the Lapita culture to expand 6,000 km across open ocean from the Bismarck Archipelago east to Micronesia and, eventually Hawaii. Galleys were eventually rendered obsolete by ocean-going sailing ships, such as the Arabic caravel in the 13th century, the Chinese treasure ship in the early 15th century, and the Mediterranean man-of-war in the late 15th century. In the Industrial Revolution, the first steamboats and later diesel-powered ships were developed. Eventually submarines were developed mainly for military purposes for people's general benefit. Meanwhile, specialized craft were developed for river and canal transport. Canals were developed in Mesopotamia BC. The Indus Valley Civilization in Pakistan and North India (from c.2600BC) had the first canal irrigation system in the world. China's canal system, whose greatest accomplishment was the Sui Dynasty's 7th-century Grand Canal between Hangzhou and Beijing, was an essential aspect of its civilization, used for irrigation, flood control, taxation, commercial and military transport, and colonization of new lands from the Zhou Dynasty until the end of the imperial era. Canals were developed in the Middle Ages in Europe in Venice and the Netherlands. Ramps for water were made in 1459. Pierre-Paul Riquet began to organise the construction of the 240 km-long Canal du Midi in France in 1665 and it was opened in 1681. In the Industrial Revolution, inland canals were built in England and later the United States before the development of railways. Specialised craft were also developed for fishing and later whaling. Maritime history also deals with the development of navigation, oceanography, cartography and hydrography. = Trade = Often, cities, as well as its surrounding agricultural areas are typically are not self sufficient. Because of this, people living in these regions had forced to trade with either other cities, nomads, or other pastoralists. People would usually trade one another for things like raw materials, (such as metals like tin, bronze, copper, or iron ore) or animals.Marks, Robert.

Along with this, quite a large amount of individuals relied on the sea and maritime trade, raiding, piracy, or smuggling for survival. Littoral peoples, reflecting symbiosis of both land and sea, would often have more in common with one another than they would with their neighboring islands. Throughout centuries in the past, water supplied the cheapest, and sometimes the only means of transporting bulk materials on a large scale, and it was also the most secure way to ensure the transport over long distances. Because of this, the proximity of the sea drew Southeast Asians to participate in long-distance trade, but it was not only water that linked the shores to one another - seafaring people, along with traders contributed to these trade routes as well.  Ports / Inland  Maritime traders most often congregated in ports, which were considered the point in which land and sea met that linked the hinterland to the wider world. There were some ports that were more favored than others, blessed with a good location, with sufficient warehouse facilities, accessible harbors, and adequate supplies of food and water became \\"entrep√¥ts,\\" which were essentially the super-centers for trade. It was rare that these ports were ever considered a final destination, though, but rather central meeting points in what was an ever changing economic and political environment. Whether in Asia, Europe, or Africa, these port centers consisted of ethnically and culturally diverse communities. Many had officials that were of foreign birth or ancestry - they were skilled in being knowledgeable of the various cultures and languages of merchants that would work throughout the ports who were also foreign, this was done in order to be successful in supervising the trade that had occurred. Throughout many of the ports, merchants had become a more powerful group in local politics. Further, these ports promoted cultural exchange, along with economic exchange, due to the fact that it had been open to the world for races, cultures, and ideas to intermix with one another, along with the fact that this blend of both locals and outsiders from diverse backgrounds that were open to accepting cultural differences. Nation building and modernity reduced the role of trade through the sea, and increased the reliance of trade through the land and the air in economic and social exchange. Even though Singapore, Bangkok, and Hong Kong are still vibrant and available to the world, similar to their Early Modern counterparts serving functions such as tourism which is unrelated to foreign trade, only a few ports are as economically crucial today as they had been in the past. Inland trade moved both by water, and over land itself. For example, shipping in small boats went along the coasts of India, but inland waterways were readily available to use to transport goods throughout many parts of India, especially in the south. Caravans that contained numbers from ten, all the way to up forty thousand pack/draught animals moved overland at a time. Combinations of these forms of transportation carried throughout the subcontinent and where therefore transshipped to and from long distance maritime trade. The majority of all of the port cities were in symbiosis with the caravan routes to and from their related hinterland interiors, and sometimes even with distant transcontinental regions. This is especially true in Central Asia - and it is suggested that the continental trade over both the land and the ocean maritime trade should be viewed not as separate or competitive, but rather as mirror images of one another.  Air  Humanity's desire to fly likely dates to the first time man observed birds, an observation illustrated in the legendary stories of Daedalus and Icarus in Greek mythology, and the Vimanas in Indian mythology. Much of the focus of early research was on imitating birds, but through trial and error, balloons, airships, gliders and eventually powered aircraft and other types of flying machines were invented. Kites were the first form of man-made flying objects, and early records suggest that kites were around before 200 BC in China. Leonardo da Vinci's dream of flight found expression in several designs, but he did not attempt to demonstrate flight by literally constructing them. During the 17th and 18th century, when scientists began analysing the Earth's atmosphere, gases such as hydrogen were discovered which in turn led to the invention of hydrogen balloons. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period of time‚Äînotably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion‚Äîled to the foundation of modern aerodynamics. Tethered balloons filled with hot air were used in the first half of the 19th century and saw considerable action in several mid-century wars, most notably the American Civil War, where balloons provided observation during the Siege of Petersburg. 611 West Lancashire Squadron lend a hand pushing an early Spitfire Mark IXb, Biggin Hill, late 1942. Apart from some scattered reference in ancient and medieval records, resting on slender evidence and in need of interpretation, the earliest clearly verifiable human flight took place in Paris in 1783, when Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier and Fran√ßois Laurent d'Arlandes went in a hot air balloon invented by the Montgolfier brothers. The Wright brothers made the first sustained, controlled and powered heavier-than-air flight on December 17, 1903, in their revolutionary aircraft, the Wright Flyer. World War II saw a drastic increase in the pace of aircraft development and production. All countries involved in the war stepped up development and production of aircraft and flight-based weapon delivery systems, such as the first long- range bomber. After the war ended, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes like the Lancaster that could be converted into commercial aircraft. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British De Havilland Comet. This marked the beginning of the Jet Age, a period of relatively cheap and fast international travel. In the beginning of the 21st century, subsonic military aviation focused on eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous vehicles. Several unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs have been developed. In April 2001 the unmanned aircraft Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft, and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003 the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. Major disruptions to air travel in the 21st Century included the closing of U.S. airspace following the September 11 attacks, the closing of northern European airspace after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Space  The realistic dream of spaceflight dated back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, however Tsiolkovsky wrote in Russian, and this was not widely influential outside Russia. Spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard's publication in 1919 of his paper 'A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'; where his application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid-propellant rockets gave sufficient power that interplanetary travel became possible. This paper was highly influential on Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun, later key players in spaceflight. The first human spaceflight was achieved with the Soviet space program's Vostok 1 mission in 1961. The lead architects behind the mission were Sergei Korolev and Kerim Kerimov, with Yuri Gagarin being the first astronaut. Kerimov later went on to launch the first space docks (Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188) in 1967 and the first space stations (Salyut and Mir series) from 1971 to 1991.Peter Bond, Obituary: Lt-Gen Kerim Kerimov, The Independent, 7 April 2003.Betty Blair (1995), \\"Behind Soviet Aeronauts\\", Azerbaijan International 3 (3). The first spaceflight to the Moon was achieved with NASA's Apollo 11 mission in 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin being the first astronauts on the Moon.  Navigational Advances  The thirteenth century saw the rise of the magnetic compass for overseas travel. Prior to its creation, seamen would have to rely on landmarks and stars as guides for navigation. The compass allowed sailors to plot a course, and using magnetic north as a reference, could travel through fog and overcast. This also led to shorter voyages, as they could plot more linear approaches to destinations. Portolan charts rose up, plotting this linear excursion routes, making sea navigation more accurate and efficient. In 1761, marine chronometer was invented.

It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne. There are several types of KP and it has been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes. The cause of KP is not completely understood. As of 2018, KP is thought to be due to abnormalities in the process of depositing the protein keratin in hair follicles, abnormalities in the hair shaft, or both. KP is usually diagnosed by a medical professional based on the appearance of the skin but dermoscopy can be used as well if the diagnosis is unclear. Variants of the ABCA12 gene have been associated with KP. KP is the most common disorder of the hair follicle in children. It is unclear how common KP is in adults with estimates ranging from 0.75% to 34% of the population. No single approach has been found to completely cure KP, but treatments can improve the cosmetic appearance of the condition. Treatment includes the application of topical preparations of moisturizers and medications such as lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, or retinoids to the skin. Fractional carbon dioxide lasers and Nd:YAG laser therapies are also effective. Signs and symptoms KP results in small, rough bumps on the surface of the skin. They are skin- colored bumps the size of a grain of sand, many of which are surrounded by a slight pink color in light skinned people and dark spots in dark skinned people. Most people with KP do not have symptoms, but the bumps in the skin can occasionally be itchy. Irritation due to scratching KP bumps can result in redness and inflammation. Though people with KP experience the condition year- round, the problem can become exacerbated, with the bumps likely to look and feel more pronounced in color and texture, during the colder months when moisture levels in the air are lower. The symptoms may also worsen during pregnancy or after childbirth. It is speculated that increased sun exposure can mitigate the symptoms of KP. Pathophysiology KP occurs when the human body produces excess amounts of the skin protein keratin, resulting in the formation of small, raised bumps in the skin often with surrounding redness. The excess keratin, which is the same color of the person's natural skin tone, surrounds and entraps the hair follicles in the pore. This causes the formation of hard plugs (process known as hyperkeratinization). Many KP bumps contain an ingrown hair that has coiled. This is a result of the keratinized skin's \\"capping off\\" the hair follicle, preventing the hair from exiting. The hair grows encapsulated inside the follicle. KP is more common in patients affected by atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. KP subtypes are occasionally part of genetically inherited syndromes associated with intellectual disability, neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes, RASopathies, ectodermal dysplasias, and certain myopathies. Diagnosis Physicians can often diagnose KP simply by examining the skin without specialized tests. However, a dermatologist can use dermoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and assess if a person with KP is responding to treatment. Physicians will often consider family history and the presence of symptoms when making the diagnosis.Mayo Clinic Staff. \\"Tests and Diagnosis\\". Mayo Clinic. Retrieved 2013-10-31 Those with this condition are generally encouraged to contact a physician if the bumps are bothersome and do not improve with over-the-counter lotions. =Differential diagnosis= Several medications can cause a skin eruption similar to KP. Medications known to produce this type of skin eruption include cyclosporine, BRAF inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. =Classification= There are several different types of KP. Variations of KP include KP rubra (red, inflamed bumps which can be on arms, head, legs), KP alba (rough, bumpy skin with no irritation), KP rubra faceii (reddish rash on the cheeks), KP atrophicans, keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, atrophoderma vermiculatum, KP atrophicans faciei, erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli, and papular profuse precocious KP. KP is commonly described in association with other dry skin conditions, such as ichthyosis vulgaris, dry skin and atopic dermatitis, including those of asthma and allergies. KP does not bear any known, long-term health implications, nor is it associated with increased mortality or morbidity. and It is not related to goose bumps, which results from muscle contractions, except that both occur in the area where the hair shaft exits the skin.

Topical creams and lotions are currently the most commonly used treatment for KP, specifically those consisting of moisturizing or keratolytic treatments, including urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, vitamin D, fish oil, or topical retinoids such as tretinoin. Improvement of the skin often takes months and the bumps are likely to return. Limiting time in the shower and using gentle exfoliation to unplug pores can help. Many products are available that apply abrasive materials to and alpha or beta hydroxy acids to assist with exfoliation. Some cases of KP have been successfully treated with laser therapy, which involves passing intense bursts of light into targeted areas of the skin. Depending on the body's response to the treatment, multiple sessions over the course of a few months may be necessary. Epidemiology Worldwide, KP affects an estimated 30 to 50% of the adult population and approximately 50 to 80% of all adolescents. It is more common in women than in men, and it is often present in otherwise healthy individuals. The skin condition is prevalent in persons of all ethnicities, and no particular ethnicity is at higher risk for developing KP. Although KP may manifest in persons of any age, it usually appears within the first decade of life and is more common in young children. In most cases, the condition gradually improves before age 30; however, it can persist longer.

Spee argued strongly against the use of torture, and as an eyewitness he gathered a book full of details regarding its cruelty and unreliability.Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. . The translator's introduction (pp. vii‚Äìxxxvi) contains many details on Spee's life. He wrote, \\"Torture has the power to create witches where none exist.\\"\\"vis tormentorum parit Sagas quae non sunt\\" from Dubium 49 of Cautio Criminalis p. 419. Life Statue in Paderborn Spee was born at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. On finishing his early education at Cologne, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1610, and pursued extensive studies and activity as a teacher at Trier, Fulda, W√ºrzburg, Speyer, Worms and Mainz, where he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1622. He became professor at the University of Paderborn in 1624. From 1626 he taught at Speyer, Wesel, Trier and Cologne, and preached at Paderborn, Cologne and Hildesheim. An attempt to assassinate Spee was made at Peine in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and priest at Paderborn and later at Cologne, and in 1633 removed to Trier. During the storming of the city by the imperial forces in March 1635 (in the Thirty Years' War), he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards of a plague infection contracted while ministering to wounded soldiers in a hospital.Frank Wegerhoff, Heiko Sch√§fer, WDR-Fernseh- Dokumentation: Vorfahren gesucht - Wolfgang Niedecken; Rainer Decker, Neue Quellen zu Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld und seiner Familie, in: Westf√§lische Zeitschrift 165 (2015) S. 160f. His name is often incorrectly cited as \\"Friedrich von Spee\\".Friedrich Spee zum 400 Geburtstag. Kolloquium der Friedrich-Spee-Gesellschaft Trier (in German). Paderborn: Gunther Franz, 2001. Publications Spee's Trutz-Nachtigal Spee's literary activity was largely confined to the last years of his life, the details of which are relatively obscure. Two of his works were not published until after his death: Goldenes Tugendbuch (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by Leibniz, and Trutznachtigall (Rivaling the Nightingale), a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the 17th century and have been repeatedly printed and updated through the present. =Cautio Criminalis= His principal work Cautio Criminalis is a passionate plea on behalf of those accused of witchcraft. The book was first printed anonymously in 1631 at Rinteln and attributed to an \\"unknown Roman theologian [Incerto Theologo Romano].\\"See 1631 Edition from Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Muenchen It is based on his own experiences in the time and place (along the Rhine) that experienced some of the most intense and fatal witch-hunts. Spee was present as a Jesuit confessor during sessions of torture and executions. > \\"If the reader will allow me to say something here, I confess that I myself > have accompanied several women to their deaths in various places over the > years and I am now so certain of their innocence that I feel there's no > effort that would not be worth my undertaking to try to reveal this > truth.\\"Spee, Question (Dubium) XI, Reason (Ratio) III, p. 50. For Hellyer's > translation see p.39. Spee wrote in direct opposition to many of the most well-known witch-phobic writers of his time and, like those works and most others in the witch-phobic lineage going back to the 15th century, Spee also wrote in Latin. > \\"I pronounce from my soul that for a long time I have not known what trust I > can place in those authors, Remy, Binsfeld, Delrio, and others... since > virtually every one of their teachings concerning witches is based on no > other foundations than fables or confessions extracted through torture.\\"Spee > trans Hellyer p. 83 Spee's Cautio Criminalis, attributed to \\"unknown Roman theologian\\" Spee pleaded for measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, and liability to damages on the part of the judges. Cautio Criminalis contains 51 \\"doubts\\" [dubiorum] which Spee discussed and carefully de- constructed. \\"Dubiorum seu Qaeestionum huius Libri.\\" Cautio Criminalis (1632) see Index. Note, Marcus Hellyer (2003) translates this line in the index as \\"doubts or questions of this book\\" but thereafter translates Spee's use of \\"Dubium\\" as the somewhat milder choice of \\"Question\\" i.e. \\"Dubium I\\" becomes \\"Question I\\" instead of \\"Doubt I.\\" Here we are following Gerhard Schormann in leaving it in the Latin i.e. \\"Dubium 9\\" see Der Krieg gegen die Hexen (1991) p.178. Amongst his more notable conclusions were: * (Dubium 17) That the accused should be provided a lawyer and a legal defense, the enormity of the crime making this all the more important. * (Dubium 20) That most prisoners will confess to anything under torture in order to stop the pain. * (Dubium 25) Condemning the accused for not confessing under torture (i.e. having employed the so-called \\"sorcery of silence\\") is absurd. * (Dubium 27) That torture does not produce truth, since those who wish to stop their own suffering can stop it with lies. * (Dubium 31) Documents the barbarous cruelty, and sexual assaults on women, brought on by the practice of strip- searching and fully shaving [tonderi] every part of prisoner's body prior to the first session of torture. * (Dubium 44) That accusations against alleged accomplices stemming from torture were of little value: either the tortured person was innocent, in which case she had no accomplices, or she was really in league with the Devil, in which case her denunciations could not be trusted either. Spee was particularly concerned about cases where a person was tortured and forced to denounce (accuse) accomplices, who were then tortured and forced to denounce more accomplices, until everyone was under suspicion: :\\"Many people who incite the Inquisition so vehemently against sorcerers in their towns and villages are not at all aware and do not notice or foresee that once they have begun to clamor for torture, every person tortured must denounce several more. The trials will continue, so eventually the denunciations will inevitably reach them and their families, since, as I warned above, no end will be found until everyone has been burned.\\" (Dubium 15) Legacy Cautio Criminalis helped bring an end to witch-hunting. The moral impact created by the publication was considerable. Already within the 17th century, a number of new editions and translations had appeared. Among the members of Spee's Jesuit order, his treatise found a favorable reception. Philipp van Limborch was a Dutch Protestant but his influential History of the Inquisition (1692) refers favorably to the work of the Jesuit Spee.Chapter XXI, p.231 of the Latin edition. For English translation see below. Limborch was close with the Englishman John Locke as the two pushed for religious toleration.1731 English translation of Limborch, see preface p.xi. =Hymns= German postage stamp honoring Spee's 400th birthday (1991) Spee wrote the lyrics and tunes of dozens of hymns, and is still the most heavily attributed author in German Catholic hymnals today. Although an anonymous hymnist during his lifetime, today he is credited with several popular works including the Advent song \\"O Heiland, rei√ü die Himmel auf\\", the Christmas carols \\"Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt\\" and \\"\\", and the Easter hymn \\"Lasst uns erfreuen\\" widely used with the 20th-century English texts \\"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\\" and \\"All Creatures of Our God and King\\".

Its plot centers on an estranged couple sailing on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the , which took place on April 14, 1912. This is an unofficial remake of an earlier German-language film, and the first English-language film with this title. It was released a day after the 41st anniversary of the sinking. The 1997 film of the same title with a different set of fictional characters and plot, was released on December 19, 1997, and also distributed by 20th Century Fox (International) and Paramount Pictures (US and Canada). Plot At the last minute, a wealthy American expatriate in Europe, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), buys a steerage-class ticket (the lowest class) for the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic from a Basque immigrant. Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac Island, Michigan, to rear them as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, Edward J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include Maude Young (based on real-life Titanic survivor Margaret \\"Molly\\" Brown), a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \\"Giff\\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns Julia's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with Richard on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that Annette is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not their son, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. He joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play auction bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds him about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, he coldly brushes him off. Meanwhile, Giff falls for Annette at first glance. At first she repulses his brash attempts to become better acquainted, but eventually she warms to him. That night, Giff, Annette, and a group of young people sing and play the piano in the dining room, while Captain Smith watches from a corner table. Second Officer Charles Lightoller (Edmund Purdom) expresses his concern to Captain Smith about the ship's speed when they receive two messages from other ships warning of iceberg sightings near their route. Smith, however, assures him that there is no danger. That night, however, the lookout spots an iceberg dead ahead. Although the crew tries to steer clear of danger, the ship is gashed below the waterline and begins taking on water. When Richard finds Captain Smith, he insists on being told the truth: the ship is doomed and there are not enough lifeboats for everyone on board. He tells his family to dress warmly but properly; then they head outside. Richard and Julia have a tearful reconciliation on the boat deck, as he places her, Annette, and Norman into a lifeboat. Unnoticed by Julia, Norman gives up his seat to an older woman and goes looking for Richard. When one of the lines becomes tangled, preventing the boat from being lowered, Giff climbs down and fixes it, only to lose his grip and fall into the water. Unconscious but alive, he is dragged onto the boat. Meeker disguises himself as a woman to get aboard a lifeboat but Maude Young notices his shoes and unmasks him in front of the others in the boat. At the other end of the spectrum of courage and unselfishness, George Healey heads down into one of the boiler rooms to comfort injured crewmen. As the Titanic is in her final moments, Norman and Richard find each other. Richard tells a passing steward that Norman is his \\"son\\" and then tells Norman that he has been proud of him every day of his life. Then they join the rest of the doomed passengers and the crew in singing the hymn \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee\\". As the last boiler explodes, the Titanics bow plunges, pivoting her stern high into the air while she rapidly slides into the icy water. The remaining survivors are last seen waiting in the lifeboats for help to come as dawn approaches.

The rescue took several hours. It is generally considered by historians that Titanic contains abundant historical inaccuracies. For example, the maiden voyage was not sold out, but actually barely more than half-booked, as shown by White Star Line records of 1912. Linda Koldau writes: \\"Titanic experts rightly emphasize that the scene at Cherbourg is historical nonsense, since the Titanic was far from being sold out and an additional passenger would easily have been able to purchase a first-class ticket ... Yet if one accepts that historical accuracy is not the point here, since the story is not at all that of the Titanic, it is a perfectly functioning script\\".

The state flag of Virginia consists of the obverse of the seal against a blue background. A state flag was first adopted at the beginning of the American Civil War in April 1861, readopted in 1912, and standardized by the General Assembly in February 1950. The current version is the only U.S. state flag depicting nudity: the standing allegorical figure of virtue has an exposed breast in the manner of classical depictions of Amazons. She has just vanquished (\\"as always,\\" as the state motto says) tyranny, who is symbolized by the fallen king. \\"So always (virtue defeats) tyrants,\\" it means. The flag may be decorated with a white fringe along the fly edge; this is usually done when the flag is displayed indoors. History George III-era seal obverse and reverse 1894 seal obverse and reverse The Virginia state flag that was used during the Civil War in the 1860s. In May 1776 the Virginia colony declared its independence from Great Britain. On July 1, 1776, a committee of four was appointed to make a proper seal for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The four men were Richard Henry Lee, George Mason, George Wythe, and Robert Carter Nicholas Sr. Four days later the committee's report for a design of the seal was read, and George Mason presented it to the Virginia government. It was voted on and approved that same day. It is not known for certain which members of the committee were chiefly responsible for the design of the seal, but it is generally believed to be principally the work of George Wythe. The seal makers did not want a design which in any way resembled the style of coats-of-arms used in Great Britain. Because of the strong admiration for the Roman Republic felt by the Virginian leaders, the design of the new seal was taken from the mythology of Ancient Rome. They also chose a two-sided design, as shown above. By 1912, many variants of the seal had become propagated, leading to confusion as which was the actual seal. Thus, Virginia decided to standardize the design of the seal to avoid confusion. Design =Obverse= The obverse of the seal is the official seal of Virginia and is used on all the official papers and documents of the Commonwealth's government, as well as on its flag. On this side, a female figure personifying the Roman virtue of Virtus was selected to represent the genius of the new Commonwealth. Virginia's Virtus is a figure of peace, standing in a pose which indicates a battle already won. She rests on her long spear, its point turned downward to the ground. Her other weapon, a parazonium, is sheathed; it is the sword of authority rather than that of combat. Virtus is typically shown with a bare left breast; this is commonly recognized as the only use of nudity among the seals of the U.S. states. Tyranny lies prostrate beneath the foot of Virtus, symbolizing Great Britain's defeat by Virginia. The royal crown which has fallen to the ground beside him symbolizes the new republic's release from the monarchical control of Great Britain; Maryland, Virginia and New York are the only U.S. states with a flag or seal displaying a crown. The broken chain in Tyranny's left hand represents Virginia's freedom from Britain's restriction of colonial trade and westward expansion. The useless whip in his right hand signifies Virginia's relief from the torturing whip of acts of punishment such as the Intolerable Acts. His robe is purple, a reference to Julius Caesar and the Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus. The motto selected for the obverse of the Virginia seal is Sic semper tyrannis, or in English, Thus always to tyrants. This is a derived quote from the famous events in Roman history, attributed to Brutus upon his participation in the slaying of Julius Caesar. (Caesar had been named perpetual dictator of Rome in the same year, and some Senators believed he had ambitions to abolish the Roman Republic and establish himself as a monarch.) A joke referencing the image on the seal that dates as far back as the Civil War, is that \\"Sic semper tyrannis\\" actually means \\"Get your foot off my neck.\\" In 2010, Ken Cuccinelli, Attorney General of Virginia, gave his staff lapel pins with Virtus's bosom covered by an armored breastplate. His spokesman, Brian Gottstein, said the pin was paid for by Cuccinelli's political action committee, not with taxpayer funds. =Reverse= The reverse of the seal pictures the blessings of freedom and peace, as represented by three Roman goddesses. In the center is the matron Libertas the goddess of individual liberties. In her hand she holds a wand showing her magical gifts, at the top of the wand hangs a Phrygian Cap, also called a Liberty Cap ‚Äî later made popular by French revolutionaries. To the left of Libertas stands Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture. In her left hand is a horn of plenty overflowing with the abundance of Virginia's harvests, while in her right hand is an enormous stalk of wheat, representing one of Virginia's leading crops. Aeternitas, representing Virginia's eternity, stands at the right of Libertas. In her right hand is a golden ball, an emblem of authority, and atop the ball is a Phoenix, symbolizing immortality. On the Virginia seal, the phoenix represents effective government. The motto gracing the reverse with its trio of Libertas, Ceres, and Aeternitas is Perseverando, or in English, Persevering, a reminder to future generations of the need to persist in maintaining the blessings of liberty. The ornamental border on both sides of the seal consists of sprigs of Parthenocissus quinquefolia, or commonly, Virginia Creeper. In 1930 another committee was charged with standardizing the seal's design because of all the variations that came into use over the years. The seals that now adorn the doors of the Southern Portico of the Capitol in Richmond were designed by Charles Keck. What the committee approved was basically adopting the 1776 seal as the standard. In 1949, another standard was implemented, when Virginia's Art Commission defined the official color scheme for the seal. The Great Seal and the lesser seal are the same except for size.

He became one of the youngest ever Australian federal Members of Parliament when he was elected to the Division of Adelaide on 26 November 1966, aged just 22 years and 184 days. At that time, only Edwin Corboy had been elected at a younger age, but that record has since been broken by Wyatt Roy. Born in Adelaide, Jones studied at the University of Adelaide and was working as a travel officer when he gained Liberal and Country League (LCL) preselection for the apparently safe Labor seat of Adelaide for the 1966 federal election. Although the election came at a bad time for Labor at both the federal and state level, few gave Jones any chance of winning. However, much to the surprise of everyone except Jones, he defeated Labor incumbent Joe Sexton. He took a narrow lead on the first count, but received an overwhelming flow of Democratic Labor Party preferences on the second count, enough for a 10 percent two-party preferred swing and 52.8 percent of the vote. Jones ruffled feathers with his views, which were extremely conservative even by general LCL standards of the time. For instance, he called alcohol \\"the devil's urine\\", and claimed that \\"half the MPs in Parliament are drunk half the time\\". He was forced to publicly apologise on the floor of the House for the latter remarks. Jones caused further controversy by releasing a book, entitled Andrew Jones M.H.R by Himself, in which he made further comments on the \\"wickedness\\" of parliament, as well as a spoken word record. The record, Shadow Valley and Iron Triangles, described by Jones as \\"anti-Communist\\", by his supporters as \\"a reaction against the spate of sick immoral and depraved pseudo-folk music which pours from the radio\\" and by detractors as \\"awful\\" or \\"pure jingoism\\", was a local Adelaide hit for Jones, who donated the proceeds to charity. It included such lines as \\"When you hear the anthem lift up your head, remember our past, see our glorious future and let your voice sing out, and friend, thank God you're free.\\" At least one Adelaide radio announcer refused to play the song. Jones' conservatism didn't play well in what was an ancestrally Labor seat. He was resoundingly defeated by Labor challenger Chris Hurford at the 1969 election, suffering a 14.3 percent two-party swing to finish with 38.7 percent of the two-party vote. Hurford actually won enough votes on the first count to defeat Jones without the need for preferences. Following the loss, Jones's reasoning to Prime Minister John Gorton for his defeat, \\"not even Jesus Christ could have held Adelaide\\", quickly entered Australian political folklore. Jones later unsuccessfully ran as an independent candidate for the Senate at the 1977 federal election before moving to Western Australia and assuming a low profile.

Life Hansford Johnson was born in London. Her mother, Amy Clotilda Howson, was a singer and actress, from a theatrical family. Her mother's father, C E Howson, worked for the London Lyceum Company, as Sir Henry Irving's Treasurer. Her father, Reginald Kenneth Johnson, was a colonial civil servant who spent much of his life working in Nigeria. Her father died when she was 11 years old, leaving debts. Her mother earned a living as a typist. Until Pamela was 22, the family lived at 53 Battersea Rise, Clapham, South London. Johnson attended Clapham County Girls Grammar School, where she excelled at English, art history, and drama. After leaving school at the age of 16, she took a secretarial course and later worked for several years at the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. She began her literary career by writing poems, which were published by Victor B. Neuburg in the Sunday Referee. In 1933, Johnson wrote to Dylan Thomas, who had also been published in the same paper, and a friendship developed. Marriage was considered, but the idea was ultimately abandoned.Andrew Sinclair, Dylan Thomas: Poet of his People (Michael Joseph, London, 1975) . pages 49‚Äì61Pamela Hansford Johnson, Important to Me (MacMillan, London 1974) 9780684139937. pages 140‚Äì149 In 1936 she married an Australian journalist, Gordon Neil Stewart. Their son Andrew was born in 1941, and a daughter Lindsay, Baroness Avebury (born 1944). Johnson and her first husband Neil were divorced in 1949. In 1950, she married her second husband, the novelist C. P. Snow (later Baron Snow). Their son Philip was born in 1952. She was a FRSL and received a CBE in 1975. She was awarded the honorary degrees of Hon. DLitt (Temple University, Philadelphia 1963; York University, Toronto; Widener university, Chester, Pennsylvania) and Hon. DHL (Louisville, Kentucky). She was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University, of Timothy Dwight College, Yale University and of Founders College, York University, Toronto and held visiting academic positions at other North American universities including Harvard, Berkeley, Haverford and Cornell.Pamela Hansford Johnson, Important to Me (MacMillan, London 1974) . pages 104Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 A plaque unveiled in May 2019 to Pamela Hansford Johnson above the house she lived in at 53 Battersea Rise. C. P. Snow died in July 1980. Less than a year later, Pamela Hansford Johnson died in London. Her ashes were scattered on the river Avon, at Stratford upon Avon. Works Hansford Johnson wrote 27 novels. Her first novel, This Bed Thy Centre, was published in 1935. Her last novel, A Bonfire, was published in the year of her death, 1981. Her themes centred on the moral responsibility of the individual in their personal and social relations.Isabel Quigley, Pamela Hansford, Johnson British Council Writers and their Work (Longmans, U.K., 1968) Her first novel, This Bed Thy Centre, caused some controversy on its release. Irish novelist Sean √ì Faol√°in, writing in The Spectator, said \\"Miss Johnson... has circumscribed herself so much by insisting on the reality of sex that her 'bed' might be thought less a centre than a circumference\\". However, the book was positively reviewed by Ralph Straus in The Sunday Times, Compton Mackenzie in the Daily Mail, and Cyril Connolly in The New Statesman. Wendy Pollard, writing in her 2014 biography of Hansford Johnson, suggests that Dylan Thomas, who suggested the title of This Bed Thy Centre, was influenced by the opening chapter when he came to write Under Milk Wood, as both works describe the different characters of their setting as the day begins. The fictional genres she used ranged from romantic comedy (Night and Silence Who is Here?) and high comedy (The Unspeakable Skipton) to tragedy (The Holiday Friend) and the psychological study of cruelty (An Error of Judgement). She also wrote two detective novels, jointly with her first husband Neil Stewart, under the joint pseudonym Nap Lombard. She wrote seven short plays, six of them in collaboration with C. P. Snow. She published a number of critical works, short stories, verse, sociological studies, and a collection of autobiographical essays. She reviewed extensively for magazines and newspapers and broadcast on the BBC radio programme The Critics. In the 2010s, some of Johnson's novels were republished by Hodder & Stoughton and Persephone Press. Reviewing five novels published by Hodder, Philip Hensher noted that \\"Johnson was an effective reporter from a particular streak of suburban London, and explored, almost without knowing, the mores and conventions of a forgotten way of living.\\" =Novels= *This Bed Thy Centre (1935) *Blessed Above Women (1936) *Here Today (1937) *World's End (1937) *The Monument (1938) *Girdle of Venus (1939) *Too Dear for My Possessing (1940) *The Family Pattern (1942) *Winter Quarters (1943) *The Trojan Brothers (1944) *An Avenue of Stone (1947) *A Summer to Decide (1948) *The Philistines (1949) *Catherine Carter (1952) *An Impossible Marriage (1954) *The Last Resort (1956) *The Unspeakable Skipton (1959) *The Humbler Creation (1959) *An Error of Judgement (1962) *Night and Silence Who is Here?
