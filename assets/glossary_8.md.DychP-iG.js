Built in 1887, it was one of the first large masonry schools to be built in the state, and became a focal point for the migration of French Canadians into the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It has been converted to residential use. Description and history The former St. Joseph's School is set in a residential area a few blocks south of Biddeford's central business district, on the north side of Birch Street, between Alfred and Graham Streets. It is a large 3-1/2 story brick building with a rectangular footprint and a full fourth story under a tall mansard roof. The roof is pierced by wall dormers featuring three-part round-arch windows topped by gablets. String courses separate the floors, and the window bays of the main (north-facing) facade are roughly grouped in threes. There is modest Romanesque brick corbelling at the eave. The main entrance is set in a 1916 brick stair tower at the northwestern end of the building. Biddeford's textile mills saw an influx of both Irish and French Canadian migrants in the mid-19th century, resulting in the establishment first of the predominantly Irish Roman Catholic parish of St. Mary's, and then in 1870 of the establishment of St. Joseph's, which catered primarily to the French Canadian Catholic population. Parochial education first began in the basement of the St. Joseph's church, and the present school was built in 1888, to a design by Dr. Ferdinand Bernier, a parishioner. The school remained an anchor of the local French immigrant population well into the 1960s, with much of the curriculum taught in French. The building has been converted to residential use.

Ethnoprimatology is a discourse aimed at an anthropological holistic understanding of non-human primates. Human cultures worldwide have deep- rooted, primordial connections with non-human primates. Non-human primates play key roles in creation stories of many societies and often depict the direct relationship between non-human primates and humans. In primatology the interface between humans and other primates is generally described as competition for space and resources, a contest between humans and other primates. While competition does occur, it is a very incomplete description of the interface, and the co-ecologies, of humans and other primates. The emerging approach, termed ethnoprimatology, is explicit in its acknowledgment of the multifarious nature of the human‚Äìother primate interface (Fuentes and Wolfe 2002, Fuentes and Hockings 2010). Case studies =South America= In the creation myths of Matsigenka mythology, humans were the first to inhabit the earth and they were slowly transformed into different animal species, starting with primates. At a party, Yavireri, the first shaman, transformed two groups of people into woolly monkeys and spider monkeys. Another myth describing the origins of primate species is that of Yari and Osheto. Yari was a lazy shaman who imbibed hallucinogens and sang songs all day. He would borrow beans from his brother-in-law Osheto, a spider monkey, and eat them rather than harvest. Then he would return to Osheto requesting more, claiming his harvest failed to grow. When Osheto discovered this deceit, he punched Yari in the throat, causing it to become swollen, like that of a howler monkey. Yaniri was then transformed into a howler monkey as punishment. In a similar story, two shamans on a failed quest to steal fire-making technology from an all-female group were transformed into primates. One of the shamans burned the hair off his face and in turn was transformed into the brown capuchin monkey. The other became intoxicated and fell head first into a woman's toilet, and was transformed into a white-fronted capuchin. The pygmy marmoset, also known as ‚Äúmother of the wind‚Äù and ‚Äúwind tail‚Äù by the Matsigenka, is thought to be magical as well as dangerous. Its name precedes its reputation, leading hunters astray and vanishing in an instant, leaving the hunter lost. The spider monkeys, although hunted by the Matsigenka, are seen as unafraid of humans, often revealing themselves in acts of territorial display. This disturbs the Matsigenka, who view these displays as demonic. Because of their loud vocalization, it is thought the howler monkeys are shamans, and thus pose spiritual hazards as well.Shepar 2007: 106 Howler monkey meat is believed to make children lazy, and capuchins meat is believed to make them dishonest as adults. =Central America= In one account outlined in the K'iche' Maya sacred text, the Popol Vuh, the gods created animals first, but were displeased when they could not speak or worship them. They then tried to make humans out of mud, but the mud people simply came undone. The gods once again attempted to make humans out of wood. The wood people, however, were stiff, could barely moved, and did not understand and thus did not respect their makers.Miller & Taube 1993: 68 The gods angrily destroyed them with rains and flood, and those wood people who escaped became spider monkeys. The spider monkeys were morphologically similar to humans but still lacked the ability to speak.Bruner 2005: 113 In a different part of the Popol Vuh, Hunbatz (which literally means 1 Howler monkey) and Hunchouen (1 Spider monkey) are the older brothers of the Hero Twins. The Hero Twins won the favor of the gods after they defeated the gods of darkness and death.Bruner 2005: 113 Naturally, Hunbatz and Hunchouen were jealous, and were always trying to find ways to end their brothers. One day, tired of their brothers‚Äô jealousy, the Hero Twins led their older brothers to a tree and convinced them to climb it, asking them to retrieve birds they had stunned with a blow gun. When they arrived at the top, the tree grew and grew until the brothers were trapped and thus turned into monkeys. In their human form, Hunbatz and Hunchouen were efficient in arts and craftsmanship, and these monkey twins are seen as patron gods to this discipline. =Africa= The Dahomey mythology of West Africa includes a myth telling of why monkeys did not become humans. Mawu, a creator of animals, made all the animals out of clay. When she decided she was not yet done, she assigned all the existing animals to work the clay so she may use it to mold other creatures. She came upon the monkey and said ‚ÄúAs you have five fingers on each hand, if you work well, I will put you among men, instead of among animals.‚ÄùHerskovits & Herskovits 1958: 152 The monkey then became excited and boasted to all the animals that he was going to be a man. Because he was distracted in his happiness, he did not work well. When Mawu saw this, she said to him ‚ÄúYou will always be Monkey, you will never walk erect.‚ÄùHerskovits & Herskovits 1958: 152 Other African tales depict monkeys doing human-like things. One South African tale tells of monkeys playing a fiddle and dancing. The Nuer believe God made monkeys to be like humans, depicting them cooking and even grieving.Wolfe 2007: 696 =India= The epic poem the Ramayana plays a central role in Hindu culture. In the epic, Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu, is exiled along with his brother and his wife, Sita. Sita is kidnapped, and in their quest to rescue her, they come across monkey-chief Sugriva, who has been similarly exiled. After helping Sugriva reclaim the throne, Sugriva agrees to help Rama find Sita, and sends them Hanuman, a monkey warrior with divine parents. Hanuman becomes a central character in the Ramayana. He flies across an ocean to find Sita in Lanka. However, Sita refuses to be saved by Hanuman, insisting on being rescued by her husband Rama. Sita's kidnapper sets Hanuman's tail ablaze, which then sets fire to most of the city. Hanuman returns with Rama and Sugriva's army of monkeys, and they battle to rescue Sita. Hanuman here displays supernatural feats, moving mountains and growing to immense size. After Rama wins, Hanuman continues to play an important role throughout the Ramayana, and is argued to be the hero of the epic. Hanuman is often depicted as having human features, with only a monkey-like mouth to give away his true form. He is praised for his strength, courage, and devotion to Rama. Today, the rhesus macaques and the Hanuman langur commonly roam the streets and temples of India. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, holy days which represent the good deeds of Hanuman, they are brought an abundance of foods.Wolfe and Fuentes 2007: 699 Because of this, there has been a population boom of monkeys in urban areas. This has forced locals to keep their windows and doors tightly shut, lest monkeys raid their homes. Government officials claim to have lost important files to monkeys. The monkeys have bitten people and threatened visiting foreign dignitaries.Murray 2009: n.p. Attempts to control the monkey population, including relocation, sterilization, and outlawing feeding them, have been ineffective.

The voting power of each club is proportional to its size. The membership elects a 9-member Board of Directors. Four Directors are responsible for four Regions of the nation. The four Regional Directors in turn select State Representatives to coordinate RRCA efforts in each state. (Some large states such as California and Texas have more than one state representative.) Although individuals can join the RRCA, the RRCA encourages individuals to join a local member running club where one is available. All members of each member running club receive the full benefits of RRCA membership. Accomplishments The RRCA has promoted women's running, including lobbying for a Women Olympic marathon and hosting women-only races. The RRCA has advocated equal prize structures for men and women runners. The RRCA member clubs conduct thousands of races each year and provide training programs for runners in every state. Many RRCA clubs award college scholarships to local runners. The RRCA has awarded 58 $5,000 annual Road Scholar stipends to promising post-collegiate athletes. Awards As a service to its members, the RRCA developed the RRCA National Running Awards to acknowledge the service and commitment of outstanding volunteers to the running community.

The church, known in German as Deutsche R√∂misch-Katholische St. Nicholas Kirche (\\"St. Nicholas Roman Catholic German Church\\"), was the national parish for the local German- speaking population.  First church (1833‚Äì1848)  =Founding= The church was founded in 1833 by the Austrian Rev. Johann Stephen Raffeiner The parish was founded in 1833 by the Austrian priest Father Johann Stephen Raffeiner (1785‚Äì1861) as the first and thus oldest German-language Catholic parish in New York City.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X. Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.353.Nadel, Stanley \\"St. Nicholas Kirke\\" in Father Raffeiner was actively engaged in establishing the parish. Back then a large German-speaking colony was located east of the Bowery, necessitating the establishment of religious services in German. Raffeiner first temporarily rented a carpenter shop on Delancey Street for services. He later leased a former meeting house of the Anabaptists located at Delancey and Pitt Streets, making a formal beginning for the first congregation of German-speaking Catholics. =Permanent structure= As the number of parishioners increased, the issue of finding a permanent structure for the church became more pressing. For this purpose, four lots of ground, with a frontage of one hundred feet and a depth of one hundred and six, on Second street, between Avenue A and First Avenue, were purchased through Dr. Joseph C. Springer, from John Jacob Astor, on September 1, 1834. The cornerstone of this new church, which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Myra, was laid, on Easter Monday, April 20, 1835, by the Very Rev. Dr. John Power, V.G., the English sermon being preached to the large concourse assembled by the Rev. Joseph A. Schneller, then of Christ Church, Ann Street,http://new-york-city.yodelout.com/new-york-city-christ-church-in- ann-street/ and a discourse in German by Father Raffeiner. The building was fifty-two by seventy feet and its cost for work and materials $8,174; for fittings $1,384 and for the organ $600. Before it was entirely finished the lease of the hired Baptist meeting house in Delancey Street expired, and the new congregation were for a time accommodated by Father Quarter in the basement of St. Mary's, Grand Street. The dedication ceremony took place on Easter Sunday, 1836. The parish was later incorporated under the old New York law with a board of lay trustees elected by the pew-holders. For seven years Father Raffeiner officiated as pastor of St. Nicholas', having as his assistant the Benedictine Father Nicholas Balleis. =Later administration= John Nepomucene Neumann became friends with Father Raffeiner, who helped him get settled in New York. There he celebrated his first Mass in the church on June 26, 1836, making the church of St. Nicholas his first spiritual home. Neumann later became the first American bishop to be canonised in 1977. In 1842 the church was formally recognised by the diocese. Father Raffeiner was succeeded in 1840 by his assistant, a Benedictine, Nicholas Balleis. Father Balleis was succeeded in 1841 by a Franciscan, Rev. John Lewitz. Archbishop Hughes brought the Redemptorists into the city, and tendered them the church property of St. Nicholas' at this time. The trustee system still obtained; the word of the founder of the parish to his flock had been, \\"Never give up your property.\\" True to these words, the parish retained control of its property, and thereby birth was given to the Holy Redeemer Church. Rev. Gabriel Rumpler, C.SS.R., appointed by Bishop John Hughes, was rector of St. Nicholas' until 1844. After battling church members and trustees he left to form the Most Holy Redeemer Church on East 3rd Street, which became the second German-speaking church. The Capuchin Ambrose Buchmeyer took charge, and remained until his death on October 11, 1861. The reminiscences of Father Bonaventure Frey recount how he and his companion, Father Francis, were welcomed in 1855 by Father Buchmeyer and his assistant, Felician Krebesz, and were invited to preach and say Mass at St. Nicholas', before continuing their journey westward.  Second church (1848‚Äì1960)  =New administration= Photograph of St. Nicholas and its rectory, on Second Street (before 1914) Second Street with the plot where the church used to stand, with the former rectory on the left remaining (2010) The ever-growing number of German-speaking immigrants necessitated a larger church. The second Church of St. Nicholas was built in 1848 in the Gothic Revival style and on December 24 dedicated by Archbishop Hughes. The schoolhouse was built in 1867. On Father Buchmeyer's death he was succeeded by Father Krebesz, also a Capuchin, and upon the death of the latter in 1876, Father Francis J. Shadier became pastor, assisted by Revs. Anthony Lamell and John B. Mayer. In 1879 Father Nicholas Sorg became pastor, and was succeeded by Father Mayer, P.R., in 1888. Rev. John A. Nageleisen took charge in 1908. During the administration of Father Sorg a number of church societies and confraternities were established, while under Father Mayer the grand sanctuary was built, together with a large house on 1st Street, the rectory on 2nd Street, and a number of improvements made. The trusteeism that threatened to undermine church discipline in matters spiritual and temporal still obtained under Father Mayer. Upon the death of Father Mayer, Archbishop Farley undertook to place the parish under the regime in vogue in the State of New York regarding church property. He selected the men to be placed in charge of the situation, repeatedly attended meetings of the people, listened to the arguments of their speakers, invited the trustees to call on him in the archiepiscopal residence, with the final result that the last vestige of trusteeism vanished in the largest diocese in America. A special feature of The New York Times in 1901 mentioned the church among other Catholic structures in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, describing the group \\"for the most part...limit[ing] themselves to the functions of a parish church, in districts where social needs are otherwise supplied.\\" Without comment on other facilities attached.\\"Centres of Civilization; On the Lower East Side of New York\\", New York Times, Jul 21, 1901. Excerpt: ‚ÄúEverybody who read it must have been struck by a remark of Mr. Hewitt's, made not very long ago, touching the tenement house district, which was considerably commented on in the press. The remark was that it was not only the part of humanity and charity for the more favored to assist the less favored, but that in this particular case, it was not less the part of prudence‚Ä¶..St. Nicholas in Second Street, St. Rose of Lima in Cannon Street, and St. Teresa in Henry Street. There is also a remarkable church, remarkable for the ...‚Äù‚Äù In 1908 began the normal form of church government in the parish, under its first pastor and rector, Father Nageleisen. Circumstances and the financial depression in the country brought the church to the verge of bankruptcy, but Archbishop Farley kept it from inevitable disaster by his aid and advice. Within a year Father Nageleisen canceled some $30,000 of the $230,000 debt. The Diamond Jubilee memorial, an artistic chandelier of metal erected on both sides of the high altar, had the form of a vine, at the root of which appear the words, \\"Pray for the benefactors of St. Nicholas' parish.\\" The tendrils encircled the names of the benefactors, and were set with electric lights as jewels, each representing $1000 paid by the donor. There were twenty tendrils or diamonds as yet, and the proceeds of the offerings were applied not only to the liquidation of the debt, but also to the missionary ends of church extension. Father Nageleisen was born at Piqua, Ohio, on August 27, 1861, and ordained in the cathedral at Cincinnati by Archbishop Elder on May 30, 1885. He taught philosophy at the theological seminary at Carthagena, Ohio, for two years, and was then assigned as professor at Saint Joseph's, Rensselaer, Indiana. In 1897 Archbishop Corrigan received him into the Archdiocese of New York, where he officiated as curate at St. Boniface's, 2nd Avenue, until 1898, when he was sent into Rockland County. In 1908 he was appointed irremovable rector of St. Nicholas'. =Rectory= The former St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church rectory, located at 135 East Second Street, between Avenue A and First Avenue, was built in 1867. According to the AIA Guide to New York City, the building is \\"an essay in the late Gothic Revival mannerism, with swell stone trim around the tiers of pointer arch windows. Note the silhouette of the demolished church on the old rectory's wall: palimpsest.\\" =Later years= In 1914 the number of parishioners was about 600. The church property at that time was valued at $445,000, with $200,000 encumbrance. The basement of the church was used by the Slovenian Catholics, who were attended by a Franciscan from Brooklyn. The societies in the parish were: Rosary, Corpus Christi, Agony of Our Lord, Confraternity of the Sacred Heart, four sodalities of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Conference of St. Vincent de Paul Society, St. Nicholas' and St. Aloysius' societies, and the St. Nicholas' School Association. The school had an attendance of 155 boys and 210 girls, and was taught by six Sisters of St. Dominic. St. Nicholas became eclipsed by the Holy Redeemer Church, as the demographics changed by the mid-20th century on the Lower East Side. Holy Redeemer Church became the leading German Catholic church in the city and St. Nicholas Kirche declined in importance. This ultimately led to the end of church services and closure of the parochial school. The church of St. Nicholas was sold in 1960 and demolished, the plot turned into a parking lot for the adjacent Village View Houses, which opened in 1964.  Organ  The organ dated from about 1881 was by Engelfried & Hadden. It was played by mechanical action with two manuals, 35 stops and 45 ranks. Lynnwood Farnam, noted concert organist of the early 20th century, visited the church on November 27, 1919, and wrote in one of his notebooks that the organ was a fine old piece in very bad condition, located west gallery, had tracker action, and electric blowing.Farnam, Lynnwood.

It belongs to the City Municipality of Ljubljana.Ljubljana municipal site Geography The scattered village lies in the hills between the Sava Plain and the Grada≈°ƒçica Valley. It is accessible by a paved road running along the ridge above the Kucja Valley; the road branches off from the main road between ≈†entvid and Dobrova and continues as an unpaved road to Topol pri Medvodah. The core of the village lies at the foot of Pe≈°tota Hill (); to the south is Vrh Peak () and further to the north is Kucelj Hill (). The karst Ravnik Plateau lies west of the village. The soil is stony and there are fields on the nearby slopes. The pastures are named Za Breznom (literally, 'behind the shaft'), Breza ('birch'), and Rupce ('sinkholes'), a meadow area is named Laz (literally, 'clearing'), and the surrounding woods are named Perca, Riglji, and Mlakov≈æ. There is also an abandoned pasture in the Mlakov≈æ Woods. There are several shallow karst shafts on the Ravnik Plateau.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2.

The modern name of the settlement literally means 'To≈°ƒç face': the noun ƒçelo (otherwise 'forehead' in Slovene) refers to a vertical or steep rocky cliff face below a summit and the adjective to≈°ko is related to Mount To≈°ƒç (1021 m) to the west (originally based on a dialect form of the adjective tolst 'fat'). The original meaning 'fat' is also reflected in the medieval German names of the settlement, containing the Middle High German word veiz(e)t 'fat'.Snoj, Marko. 2009.

It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in woodlands, desert, and plateau habitat. It often grows anchored on cliffs and prefers rocky, granular soils, especially limestone.US Forest Service Fire Ecology Orthography The species name was originally spelled P. stansburiana, but due to a 2006 rule change under the ICBN, the last letter has been restored since the plant was named in honor of Howard Stansbury. Description Purshia stansburyana is a shrub generally growing up to about one to three meters tall, known to approach 4 meters to up to 8 meters in exceptional circumstances, becoming somewhat treelike. It easily hybridizes with other Purshia species. It is covered in shreddy bark. The small, very thick, glandular leaves are divided into several lobes which may be divided into sub-lobes. The leaves on the upper side are dotted, i.e. are punctate. The shrub blooms abundantly in white or cream-colored flowers with clawed petals; flowers are strongly and sweetly fragrant. Blooming continues from spring until the first frost. The fruit is an achene, a long plumelike structure up to 6 centimeters long. The plume is dispersed on the wind and by animals such as rodents. The shrub is drought- tolerant and the seedlings may actually survive better in years of below average precipitation. Uses The Stansbury's cliffrose shrub provides valuable browse for many wild ungulates, including elk, mule deer, and desert bighorn sheep, as well as livestock. Many birds and rodents consume the seeds, with rodents caching them underground, where they may sprout later. It is used for revegetation projects in degraded habitat in its native region, and as an ornamental. It was used by Native American groups for a variety of purposes, the bark being worked into fiber for clothing, bedding, and rope, and the branches being made into arrows.

Pioneering and successful exporters, they had a huge influence on South Africa's fruit industry. They divided up and donated most of their farming enterprise, to be distributed to, and used for the benefit of, Elgin farm workers. After his death, the younger brother Harry left the remainder as a trust fund that continues their charitable work to this day.C. Schoeman: The Historical Overberg.

Stander: Tree of Life. The Story of Cape Fruit. S&W; Ltd. Cape Town. 1983. p.7. The brothers first invested in the Palmiet area in 1903. They may have been influenced by the purchase of some land in the area by their older brothers, Percy and Frank Molteno. From modest beginnings farming vegetables, they eventually built up a vast farming enterprise that spanned the entire valley and what is now the largest single export fruit producing area in Southern Africa. They restructured the South African fruit farming industry along scientific lines, pioneering new farming and cold storage practices and were influential in the development and uplifting of rural communities in the area. They also founded the Cape Tercentenary Foundation in 1950 to promote and support the arts and the environment in the Cape (Both brothers were extremely well read, appreciators of music and the arts, and were deeply concerned about the natural environment). At the height of their success, the brothers took the unusual move of ordering that their network of farms was to be divided up and returned \\"...to Elgin's farmworkers and inhabitants for their own use.\\" This process accelerated in the 1950s after Edward's death. Their farming enterprise was broken up and ceased to exist, but its name, Elgin, came to refer to the whole region.

History The BEST Education Network emerged from a broader initiative known as Business Enterprises for Sustainable Travel, which was founded in 1998. The primary objective of BEST was to develop and disseminate knowledge in the field of sustainable tourism. In 2003 BEST went through organisational changes and the group overseeing the educational and curriculum aspects of the organisation became independent and renamed itself the BEST Education Network. Structure The BEST Education Network is coordinated by an international Executive Committee of academics with expertise in sustainable tourism. The committee is currently chaired by Dr. Gianna Moscardo. Think Tanks BEST-EN holds annual Think Tanks at various universities around the world, during which research is presented, sustainable tourism topics are discussed, and resources for teaching and practice in sustainable tourism are developed.Intute The BEST Think Tanks draw together educators, researchers, consultants and practitioners from the tourism industry. Their knowledge and experience are incorporated into the design of various resources on sustainable tourism including research agendas, identification of issues, current research and implications for practice. The Think Tanks consist of research presentations, keynote speakers, a research agenda, and curriculum development sessions. Each year the Think Tank has a particular theme and seeks to provide vision and cutting-edge insight to the topic at hand. Past themes have included: *Think Tank XIX: Creating Sustainable Tourist Experiences, San Fancisco State University, USA *Think Tank XVIII: Marketing of Sustainable Tourism Products, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences & Arts, Switzerland *Think Tank XVII: Innovation and Progress in Sustainable Tourism, University of Mauritius, Switzerland *Think Tank XVI: Corporate Responsibility in Tourism - Standards, Practices and Policies, Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, Germany *Think Tank XV: The Environment-People Nexus in Sustainable Tourism: Finding the Balance, University of Pretoria, South Africa *Think Tank XIV: Politics, Policy and Governance in Sustainable Tourism, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia *Think Tank XIII: Engaging Communities in Sustainable Tourism Development, Taylor's University, Malaysia *Think Tank XII: Mobilities and Sustainable Tourism, SKEMA Business School, France *Think Tank XI: Learning for Sustainable Tourism, Temple University, USA *Think Tank X: Networking for Sustainable Tourism, MODUL University, Austria *Think Tank IX: The Importance of Values in Sustainable Tourism, James Cook University, Singapore *Think Tank VIII: Sustaining Quality of Life through Tourism, Izmir University of Economics, Turkey *Think Tank VII: Innovations for Sustainable Tourism, The Northern Arizona University, USA *Think Tank VI: Corporate Social Responsibility for Sustainable Tourism, The University of Girona, Spain *Think Tank V: Managing Risk and Crisis for Sustainable Tourism: Research and Innovation, The University of West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica *Think Tank IV: Sustainability and Mass Destinations: Challenges and Possibilities, The University of Southern Denmark, Denmark *Think Tank III: Strategic Management and Events & Meeting Management, Costa Rica *Think Tank II: Tourism Transportation and Tourism Operations, University of Hawaii, USA *Think Tank I: Tourism Marketing, Tourism Planning, and Development and Human Resources Management, South Africa The Think Tanks are open to academics, educators, researchers, government officials, industry experts, sustainability experts, environmental, economic, community and cultural experts in the tourism field. Each Think Tank provides an opportunity for participants to highlight and explore topics that are of significance to the practice of tourism and/or sustainability. Interested delegates are invited to participate in workshops to identify 'hot topics' in sustainable tourism, outlining the specific problems linked to these topics, exploring the types of approaches that can be taken to develop 'cutting edge' research and solutions in these areas, and discussion of implications for stakeholder decision making and policy makers. Education In 2007, BEST EN launched the Tourism Education Futures Initiative (TEFI), which seeks to provide vision, knowledge and a framework for tourism education programs to promote global citizenship and optimism for a better world. An important outcome of the TEFI process is a set of five values-based principles that tourism students should embody upon graduation to become responsible leaders and stewards for the destinations where they work or live. The five value sets are: 1. Ethics, 2. Stewardship, 3. Knowledge, 4. Professionalism and 5. Mutuality, and are portrayed as interlocking Value Principles because of their interconnectedness and their permeability. BEST EN has also been involved in the development of the INNOTOUR platform. INNOTOUR is a WEB 2.0 platform for education, research and business development in tourism and is an experimental meeting place for academics, students and enterprises. Launched in 2009, INNOTOUR is based on content created by the users. The platform is designed to facilitate international interaction and knowledge dissemination between students. New educational and scientific collaborative practices are developed to build interdisciplinary bridges between international campuses.

In the Marc Maron podcast Demers talks about his political beliefs and his early affiliation as a teenager with a small Marxist activist group in Vancouver. His commitment to the group was such that he initially decided to forgo going to university and instead get a job in a lighting factory where he hoped to increase the political consciousness of his fellow workers. He admitted however that the aims of the organization were somewhat vague and that the efforts to raise the consciousness of fellow workers were mostly met with bemusement. Nevertheless, Demers retains left wing political views and hosts a monthly podcast \\"Well Reds A Left Book Podcast\\".

Another such lesson in the benefit of living in Canada came with the experience of Demers' mother in law who is originally from Hong-Kong and moved to Canada from Chicago as a result of Pierre Trudeau's stated policy of multiculturalism.

The city and its suburbs may be traversed using road and rail. Within the city, city buses, taxis and auto rickshaws provide mobility. Scooters and motorcycles are the favored means of personal transport. Ola, Uber and other taxi services operate there. Road Map of South Kerala NH66 in Trivandrum City National Highway 66 (old NH 47) passes through the city. Thiruvananthapuram can be accessed from the North South Corridor National Highway 44, via NH 544 (old NH-47) at Salem, and at Kochi via NH 66. It connects southern cities such as Kollam, Kochi, Thrissur, Palakkad, Coimbatore and Salem. From the south NH 66 at Kanyakumari provides the North South Corridor (NH 44). It passes through Nagercoil. The city is connected by state highways such as SH 1, SH 2 and SH 45. The Main Central Road (MC Road) is the arterial State Highway in Kerala. It starts from National Highway NH 47 at Kesavadasapuram in the city. It connects Angamaly through Kottayam with the capital city. Mahatma Gandhi road is a multi-lane road and the main arterial. The main wholesale business district of the city, Chalai Bazaar is situated there. Kerala Government Secretariat, Kerala University etc. are near that road. Another important road is the Kowdiar road, also known as the royal road, as it leads to Kowdiar Palace. The exponential growth of service and IT-based sectors coupled with its prominence as the state capital and tourist center has strained transport infrastructure. Mitigating projects include the construction of flyovers and underpasses. The first phase includes 42 km of six-lane and four-lane dual carriage ways. Although road construction is of a high standard, with appropriate marking and signage; a majority of Tier-II roads remain too narrow for the levels of traffic using them. =Bus= Intra-city public transport is dominated by the state-owned KSRTC (Kerala State Road Transport Corporation). Private bus services are also available. KSRTC city services operate from six depots: City depot, Vikas Bhavan, Peroorkada, Pappanamcode, Kaniyapuram and Vellanad. These services were revamped in 2005 with the introduction of modern buses and electronic ticketing. KSRTC also operates JnNURM transport services and the Ananthapuri City Fast services for the city. The central city bus terminal is located at East Fort (Kizhakke kotta), near Padmanabha Swamy temple. The Central Inter State bus station is located away at Thampanoor, opposite Trivandrum Central Railway Station. The terminal connects Thiruvananthapuram to other parts of Kerala as well as other states. No bus service connects the Trivandrum airport to the central city bus terminal.

Thiruvananthapuram Pettah, Kochuveli railway station, Kazhakoottam and Veli Railway Stations are located towards the north and Nemom railway station is to the south. The Central railway station is located at Thampanoor, 8 km from the airport. Kaniyapuram, Balaramapuram and Neyyattinkara railway stations serve the metropolitan area. The city is connected by rail to almost all major cities in India on a daily basis, while cities like Amritsar, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Ahmedabad, Kanpur, Jammu Tawi, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Bilaspur, Indore, Howrah and Guwahati are multi-day journeys. Kochuveli railway station is a satellite station developed to ease congestion. Thiruvananthapuram is the first major South Indian city on the longest train route in India, Kanyakumari to Jammu.

They decide to run away to Tibet together, but while going the Tertium Quid's horse is spooked. Horse and rider tumble from the road, which passes by the cemetery. The Tertium Quid is killed in the fall and is buried in the freshly dug grave. A Wayside Comedy Major and Mrs. Vansuythen come to live at the station of Kashima. After a time, Mrs. Boulte comes to suspect that her husband has fallen for Mrs. Vansuythen. So when he confronts her about whether she loves him or not, she admits her own affair with Captain Kurrell. Mr. Boulte is overjoyed and carries the news to Mrs. Vansuythen, imploring her to run away with him. Mrs. Vansuythen, however, becomes distraught to learn that she has not been the only one receiving attentions from Captain Kurrell. The last to find out is Captain Kurrell, who loses both women in one swoop. Mrs. Vansuythen informs both men that she hates them and refuses to see either again. Mr. Boulte and Captain Kurrell become friends, so that both may prevent the other from causing either Mrs. Boulte or Mrs. Vansuythen any grief.

Mrs. Hauksbee becomes more alarmed when a young man, the Hawley Boy, whom she's been grooming to marry the Holt girl, takes an interest in Mrs. Delville. Her estimation of Mrs. Delville improves a little, though, when Mrs. Delville rejects 'The Dancing Master' after learning that he was married and had a family. Later, when Mrs. Hauksbee is helping take care of children during an epidemic of diphtheria, she gains a greater appreciation of Mrs. Delville when the later saves a child who is choking to death.

Bobby takes him fishing and makes friends with him, eventually inspiring him to improve his behaviour and become a better soldier. Bobby has this sort of effect on most of the soldiers in his regiment. Bobby goes on leave to Simla, but is called back early because cholera is spreading through the regiment. Bobby rallies the spirits of many of the men, aiding in their recovery. When Dormer falls ill, Bobby spends the whole night in the tent, holding his hand. Bobby then falls ill and though he fights to stay alive (in part because he'd left a girl back in Simla), he eventually succumbs to the disease.

It refers to the relatively small group of activists that is highly aware and active in politics, and from whom the national leadership is largely drawn. As Max Weber noted, they not only live \\"for politics\\"‚Äîlike the old notables used to‚Äîbut make their careers \\"off politics\\" as policy specialists and experts on specific fields of public administration.Weber 1958 p. 84 Mosca approached the study of the political class by examining the mechanisms of reproduction and renewal of the ruling class; the characteristics of politicians; and the different forms of organisation developed in their wielding of power. Elected legislatures may become dominated by subject-matter specialists, aided by permanent staffs, who become a political class.Eliassen and Pedersen, (1978) Comparative elites The presence or absence of a political class in a country depends on its history. For example Germany (since 1945) has a very weak political class, with a \\"striking taboo\\" against the sort of elitism that dominated Germany before 1945, including Imperial Germany, Weimar and the Nazi regime.Thies and Schneider (1994) In sharp contrast France has a very prestigious political class trained in special elite schools. =Britain= Until the 1970s Britain featured a tight-knit political class that emerged from upper-class families whose sons came to know each other at elite \\"public schools\\" (like Eton College and Harrow School) and the \\"old boy\\" network, based on Oxford and Cambridge, which dominates public life. After 1970, however, the political class became much more open in terms of the social origins of British politicians and top civil servants. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) increasingly include those educated at non-elite schools and are of modest social backgrounds. Labour MPs, in turn, are increasingly middle class, white- collar and university educated. Still, the educational formation of British cabinet ministers has been dominated by a limited number of exclusive institutions at both post-primary and higher educational levels. =Spain= A political class emerged in Spain during the reign (1833‚Äì68) of Queen Isabella II. A modern political class emerged in Spain, adapted to the needs of a representative state that was under construction. To bring that about, the circles of power were open to intense renewal, coopting families of provincial gentry networks. The result was a political class composed mostly of jurists and attached to the values and interests of landed property. It was a new ruling class. Although originally inspired by revolutionary principles, it soon limited the circle of power, becoming aristocratic and largely closed to new membership.Juan Pro Ruiz, \\"La Formacion De La Clase Politica Liberal En Espa√±a (1833‚Äì1868),\\" [\\"The formation of the liberal political class in Spain, 1833-68\\"] Historia Contemporanea, 2001, Issue 2, pp 445-481 =Nigeria= Lucas (1998) examines despotic versus infrastructural power in terms of relations between the military leaders and the civilian political class in Nigeria from 1985 to 1993. He concludes that weak states experience a conflict between these two types of power. Despotic power, in sociologist Michael Mann's definition, refers to the state's repressive capacities, while infrastructural power refers to its ability to penetrate society and implement its decisions. Whereas leaders cultivate alliances with powerful social groups to realise their infrastructural power, the exercise of despotic power can undermine such patterns of collaboration. Military leaders relied on a number of despotic strategies to extend their control over the political class as part of a promised transition to democracy: many politicians were banned, two government-created political parties were imposed, and elections that yielded outcomes threatening to military interests were annulled. While the military leadership was successful in repressing the politicians, it was unable to restructure the civilian leadership in ways that would further the institutional power of the state. The military's persistent reliance on despotic strategies led to a long-term decline in the integrity and infrastructural capacity of the state. =China= In China, the country was prevalently agricultural, dominated by an imperial bureaucracy that was crowned by the Mandarins. This was made up of judges, governors, administrators, all highly qualified in the art of governing. The literary official became the pillar of the political system.Jonathan D. Spence, The Search for Modern China (1991), Populism Populist political movements portray themselves as the enemies of the established political class and outsiders from the main political class that no longer represents the people and are morally corrupt. Such movements have included the United Kingdom‚Äôs United Kingdom Independence Party, France's National Front, Austria's Freedom Party and Belgium's Vlaams Belang.Ximena Sosa-Buchholz and Michael L. Conniff \\"Populism\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Modern World, ed. by Peter N. Stearns. (2008) =United States= The term political class has recently been used as an epithet by conservatives, such as the editors of National Review. The theme is that the political elite is undemocratic and has an agenda of its own‚Äîespecially the aggrandisement of its own power‚Äîthat is hostile to the larger national interest, and which ought to be opposed by grassroots of populist movements.Horowitz (2003) There was a large movement for term limits in the United States in the 1990s to weaken the political class by limiting the number of terms an elected legislator could serve. Even though it succeeded in many states and cities it was rejected as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court when it tried to limit the number of terms that a federal officeholder could serve.

It was introduced by Adi Shankaracharya in 2000 B.C. Jews celebrate this ceremony in the name of Javed Habat or Brit Mila. In United Kingdom, the Infant Baptism ceremony resembles Balasara. It was also celebrated in ancient Greece and Persia. Process The Barasala (is authentically called as Balasare) is usually celebrated on the 11th day, 16th day, 21st day, 3rd month or 29th month after the birth of a child. Brahmins determine an auspicious time for the ceremony, which is conducted either at a temple or at home. Prior to this function, the house is cleaned well to perform some pujas. On the day, the baby is given a bath, clothed and placed in a cradle. Women gather around the cradle to sing traditional songs. In the ritual, the mother is honored and the child is blessed by the elders of the family and community. The father whispers the baby's name into its ear three times. The name is also written on rice spread on the floor or on a tray. The child's maternal uncle takes a gold ring dipped in a mixture of cow milk & honey and puts it on the baby's tongue. The elders then give blessings to the child that it may earn a good reputation, become a great person, and have a bright future. Purpose Although the child cannot understand the purpose, the ceremony helps the parents to realize that they have to shape their child into a good citizen and show a bright future to the child. It also helps the guests to realize the greatness and sweetness of human life.

It is one of the most important festivals for the Kumauni people as it signifies not only the victory of good over evil but also end of the winter season and the start of the new sowing season which holds great importance for this agricultural community of the North Indian Himalayas. It is an amalgamation of the cultural traditions of North India and the local traditions of Kumaon. The uniqueness of the Kumaoni Holi lies in its being a musical affair, whatever its form, be it the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi all of which start from Basant Panchmi. This results in the festivities of Holi lasting for almost two months in Kumaon. The Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are unique in that the songs on which they are based have a combination of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi is also known as Nirvan Ki Holi or Holi of Salvation. Kumauni Holi has characteristics which are very different from Holi celebrations anywhere in the country. Forms of Holi The following are the various forms musical gatherings in which Holi songs are ceremonially sung which are viewed as the start of the Holi celebration. All of these celebrations in the form of musical gatherings start on the Basant Panchmi Day. =Origins= The Origin of the forms of Holi especially Baithaki Holi musical traditions are in 15th century Champawat (court of the Chand kings) where the musical traditions of Braj mixed with Kumaoni musical traditions of Khadi Holi Of Champawat (Sui, Gumdesh, bilde & bishung) The Ustads which came from the plains (places like Rampur ) made the singing of Holi famous & loved not just among the rulers but also with the common masses, who slowly adopted it and gave it a distinctive Kumauni flavour. A style which is a unique blend of classical music and folk. While, to some it might resemble Thumri because of the presence of Shringar Ras in it but it is totally different, the way the Bandish are rendered, elaborated and the way some of the Raags are presented. With the spread of Chand rule and integration of Kumaon under them the Holi traditions spread all across Kumaon and acquired their distinct Kumaoni flavour. =Baithaki Holi= Baithki Holi (‡§¨‡•à‡§†‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§≤‡•Ä), (literally Sitting Holi) is a form of musical gatherg starting from the day of Basant Panchmi held all across Kumaon till the Dulhendi (or the last full moon day of the lunar month Phalguna). In some areas of Kumaon it starts even earlier at the peak of winter on the first Sunday of the Indian month of Paush that is in the month of December and they celebrates baithaki holi till March (4 months) and during baithaki holi they do not use colours to celebrate. The Baithaki Holi songs are based on the classical traditions of Hindustani Classical Music but have heavy influence of Kumaoni folk music traditions. The Baithki Holi begins from the premises of temples, where Holiyars (‡§π‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞), (the singers of Holi songs) as also the people gather to sing songs to the accompaniment of classical music like harmonium and tabla. Generally starting from the first Sunday of Paush these are known as Nirvana Holi. Some of the holi's written by Swami Brahmanand are also sung and are called Brahmanand ki holi. From Shivratri the focus then Shifts to Shivpadi Holi's. Most famous Baithaki Holi groups lives in Pati, Champawat district. And there is at least one musical player in all families. They sings their own made baithaki holi songs in regional kumaoni language or hindi language. Kumaonis are very particular about the time when the songs based on ragas should be sung. For instance, at noon the songs based on Pilu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas are sung while evening is reserved for the songs based on the ragas like Kalyan, Shyamkalyan, Kafi, Jaijawanti etc. There is a certain distinctiveness in the presentation of ragas (melodies) too and some of them like Janglakafi (which is a special ang of khamaj) are unique to kumauni holi The Taal's used are also unique. Dhamaar taal in kumauni holi has 16 matra's rather than 14 as in Indian classical music tradition. The other most widely used taal is known as Chanchar which also has 16 matra's. Other than these Teental and keharwa are widely used & at times one may also find Dadra being used but in most common case it is Chanchar -Teental -Keharwa in a Sitarkhani gat. The Baithaks or sittings are held in the local community centres and even at local homes. It generally starts with Rag Dhamaar and ends with Rag Bhairavi. The songs are usually religious in nature and concern tales from the life of the Hindu God Krishna and Ram . Still these Baithaks are an inter-religious affair as even Muslims and Christians participate in these gatherings. ‡§π‡•ã‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ó--- ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶, ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡§Ø, ‡§π‡•ã‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡•ã ‡§´‡§æ‡§ó‡•Å‡§® ‡§ã‡§§‡•Å ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Ä,‡§ú‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§≠‡§∞‡•Ç‡§Ç‡•§ =Khadi Holi= Khadi Holi (‡§ñ‡§°‡§º‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§≤‡•Ä), (literally Standing Holi) usually starts along with but sometimes a little later than Baithaki Holi. It is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, sporting traditional white nokdaar topi, churidar payajama and kurta, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments like the Dhol ,Joda (Metal Instrument) Hurka. Men in groups singing Khadi holi songs which are much more Kumaoni in flavour than the classical renditions of the Baithaki holi visit different homes and greet the members of that house and chant hymns praying for prosperity of the householder.

The Cheer is basically a bonfire with a green Paiya tree branch in the middle. The Cheer of every village and mohalla is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to steal the others cheer. The cheer is the centre of the festivities. The Cheer is burnt on the night before Holi and is known as Cheer Dahan is symbolic of the victory of the pious Prahlad over his evil father's plans. =Chharadi= Dulhendi known as Chharadi (‡§õ‡§∞‡§°‡§º‡•Ä), in Kumaoni (from Chharad (‡§õ‡§∞‡§°‡§º), or natural colours made from flower extracts, ash and water) is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way as all across North India. Principal ingredients of the celebration are Abeer and Gulal, in all possible colours. Next comes squirting of coloured water using pichkaris. Coloured water is prepared using Tesu flowers, which are first gathered from the trees, dried in the sun, and then ground up, and later mixed with water to produce orange-yellow coloured water. Another traditional Holi item now rarely seen is a red powder enclosed in globes of Lakh, which break instantly and cover the party with the powder. =Shubh Kamna= The culmination of the holi celebrations takes place with throwing abeer, gulal in the air and reciting out aloud in unison the following prayer in Kumaoni for a healthy and prosperous year ahead. ‡§π‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã ‡§≤‡§ñ ‡§∞‡•á (may you live a hundred thousand years) ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¨‡•Ç ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∏‡•å ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ ‡§¨‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏ (may our grandparents live for a hundred thousand years) ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§á‡§ú‡§æ ‡§¨‡•å‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∏‡•å ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ ‡§¨‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏ (may our parents live for a hundred thousand years) ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç ‡§≠‡•å‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∏‡•å ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ ‡§¨‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏ (may our brothers and their families live for a hundred thousand years) ‡§π‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã ‡§≤‡§ñ ‡§∞‡•á (may you live a hundred thousand years) Cuisine Special culinary preparations for Holi include gujia (fried dumpling filled with a sweet filling of roasted khoya, a milk extract, and dry fruits and nuts) and Aaloo Gutuk (‡§Ü‡§≤‡•Ç ‡§ó‡•Å‡§ü‡•Å‡§ï), which is fried potatoes seasoned with jamboo (a Himalayan spice) and Bhaang ki Chutney. Significance Apart from its symbolic significance of victory of pious Prahlad over his evil father Hiranyakashipu's plans. In Kumaon holi also signifies the end of the long Himalayan winter and the beginning of a new sowing season which is to be celebrated it also means a break from the rigorous life of hard agricultural labour for a few days for the Kumaoni peasantry.

It belongs to the City Municipality of Ljubljana and is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola. It is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Ljubljana municipal site Name The name Veliki Lipoglav literally means 'big Lipoglav' (in contrast to the neighboring village of Mali Lipoglav 'little Lipoglav'). The name was first attested in 1169 as Luppoglau (and as Lipoglaw in 1256, Luppoglau in 1321, Luppoglaw in 1467, and Lippa in 1763‚Äì1787). The name appears to be a compound of lipa 'linden' + glava 'hilltop', supposedly meaning 'hilltop covered with linden trees.' However, the early attestations of the name indicate that it is actually derived from *Lupoglav, presumably from *lup—ä 'bare, exposed', thus meaning 'bare hilltop'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 235. In the past the German name was Gro√ülipoglau. History A path leads from Veliki Lipoglav to nearby Pugled Hill (615 m), where there is a prehistoric burial mound. During the Second World War, the first locals joined the Partisan forces on 13 July 1941. A battalion was formed and spent the winter in tents until it was attacked by Italian forces on 23 March 1942. The Partisans evaded the encircled forces and escaped through the railway tunnel in ≈†marje to Lower Carniola. Italian forces burned one house in Veliki Lipoglav and killed all the men in three houses on 24 March 1942. The second group of detachments of the Slovene Partisans was established in April 1942 on Pugled Hill. A commemorative stone marks the site.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971.

The early Jewish midrash Genesis Rabba (23.3)Sacred Texts: Judaism: The Bereshith or Genesis Rabba, a selection of sayings from the work translated into English by Samuel Rapaport identifies this Naamah (the daughter of Lamech and sister of Tubal-cain) as the wife of Noah (see Rashi's commentary on Genesis 4:22), while some Jewish traditions associate her with singing. The Naamah mentioned in the Bible is a Cainite, a descendant in the lineage of Cain. However, a Sethite Naamah is named as the wife of Noah, and a daughter of Enoch, Noah's grandfather, in a medieval midrash. The 17th-century theologian John Gill mentioned a theory which identified Naamah instead with the name of the wife of Ham, son of Noah, who he believed may have become confused with Noah's wife. See Wives aboard the Ark.Exposition of the Old and New Testament, by John Gill, (1746‚Äì63), at sacred-texts.com., note on Genesis 4:22.

The CD reissue of At Shelly's Manne-Hole adds All the Things You Are, not featured on either original LP. 1983 LP Track Listing Side 1: # \\"Who Cares?\\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:22 # \\"In a Sentimental Mood\\" (Duke Ellington) - 4:23 # \\"Everything Happens to Me\\" (Tom Adair, Matt Dennis) - 4:46 # \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" (Cole Porter) - 5:48 * Side 2: # \\"Time Remembered\\" (Bill Evans) - 5:37 # \\"My Heart Stood Still\\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 4:33 # \\"Lover Man\\" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) - 5:06 * # \\"Blues in F/Five\\" (Chuck Israels/Bill Evans) - 5:41 * Side 3: # \\"Love Is Here to Stay\\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 4:48 * # \\"'Round Midnight\\" (Thelonious Monk, Cootie Williams) - 8:58 * # \\"Stella by Starlight\\" (Victor Young, Ned Washington) - 4:59 * # \\"How About You?\\" (Ralph Freed, Burton Lane) - 4:04 * Side 4: # \\"Isn't It Romantic\\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 4:39 * # \\"The Boy Next Door\\" (Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane) - 5:24 * # \\"Wonder Why\\" (Nicholas Brodzsky, Sammy Cahn) - 5:16 # \\"Swedish Pastry\\" (Barney Kessel) - 5:48 *Indicates selections recorded on May 30, 1963, all others May 31. 1999 CD Track Listing # \\"Danny Boy\\" (Frederick Weatherly) - 10:41 # \\"Like Someone in Love\\" (Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen) - 6:27 # \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\" (Dave Brubeck) - 2:58 # \\"Easy to Love\\" (Cole Porter) - 4:42 # \\"Some Other Time\\" (Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, Adolph Green) - 6:12 # \\"Lover Man\\" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) - 5:06 # \\"Who Cares?\\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:24 # \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" (Cole Porter) - 5:48 # \\"How About You?\\" (Ralph Freed, Burton Lane) - 4:06 # \\"Everything Happens to Me\\" (Tom Adair, Matt Dennis) - 4:47 # \\"In a Sentimental Mood\\" (Duke Ellington, Manny Kurtz, Irving Mills) - 4:26 # \\"My Heart Stood Still\\" (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) - 4:34 # \\"Time Remembered\\" (Bill Evans) - 5:35 Personnel *Bill Evans - piano *Chuck Israels - bass *Larry Bunker - drums References Category:Bill Evans live albums Category:1983 live albums Category:Milestone Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Orrin Keepnews Category:Albums recorded at Shelly's Manne-Hole ","title":"Time Remembered (album)"},{"id":"27075193","text":"Somchai Chuayboonchum (Thai ‡∏™‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏¢ ‡∏ä‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°) is a Thai football coach and former footballer.

Information capital connotes that sharing information is a means of sharing power, supporting personnel, and optimizing working processes. Information capital is the pieces of information which enables the exchange of Knowledge capital. Overview In management, information capital is usually described as a set of data which are valuable for organisation and can be reached through different data storing systems, such as intro and internet systems, computer databases, libraries, and information sharing networks. Information capital can be used not only by organisations but by individuals as well. For example, if use of information capital enables an individual to analyse his spending on a certain type of products and determine how it compares in relation to his spendings on other products or to the spendings of other people, this might affect his future purchasing decisions.https://www.wired.com/2013/03/are-you-maximizing-your-information- capital/ In the Information Era, efficient use of information capital highly depends on information capital readiness with IT, as information capital derived from information systems readiness. So companies which are investing more in IT systems might get competitive advantage over other businesses Information capital market Information capital markets are commercial markets for the buying and selling of information and data. These markets connect data aggregators with organisations and individuals who need information for business, scientific or any other purposes. Regulating acts such as Data Protection Act 1998 and Data Protection Directive are imposed to control information capital market and prevent inappropriate usage of personal information by data aggregators or any other individuals and organizations. Although information has been bought and sold since ancient times, the idea of an information marketplace is relatively recent. The first Information market has formed around the Credit bureau type of organization for the exchange of personal information in the financial industry. But since that time Information market have changed radically. Nowadays Information markets are mainly hosted on electronic based data aggregation systems. Vast majority of them are accessible for both governments and organizations within corporate or any other sectors. Some information capital market platforms can be accessed directly by the public, for example SocialSafe Ltd which is social media backup tool that also allows users to download their content from a variety of social networks to their own personal data store and then sell this information directly. Era of Big data Big data is large amounts of information which are so massive and complex that they become impossible to analyse using traditional data processing technologies, requiring special technologies instead. Recent advances in big data analyses have a potential to change the way information capital market operates nowadays, because if commercial organisations will be able to analyse and structure information about millions of people in any part of the world, this will negate the value of information which comes from one individual or organization, and will allow companies to make faster and more accurate data-driven decisions. Some scientists even predict that advances in big data analysis will have even larger effect on information capital market than the creation of the internet. List of companies operating in big data analytics: IBM - IBM offers DB2, Informix and InfoSphere database software, Cognos and SPSS analytics applications, and Global Services division. HP - HP is a major provider of big data software analysis tools. Oracle - Oracle develops both hardware and software products for big data processing. They include Oracle NoSQL Database, Apache Hadoop, Oracle Data Integrator and many other. SAP - SAP is a largest provider of software appliances for big data handling and analytics. Microsoft - Microsoft in partnership with Hortonworks offers the HDInsights tool which is used to analyse unstructured information provided by data aggregators. Google - Google is working on development of BigQuery - first cloud-based big data processing platform.

Bible narrative  Biblical genealogy  Lamech is the eighth-generation descendant of Adam (), the son of Methuselah, and the father of Noah (), in the genealogy of Seth in Genesis 5. In Genesis 5:12-25, Lamech was a son of Methuselah, who was a grandson of Jared, who was a grandson of Kenan descended from Adam. Genesis 5:28‚Äì31 records that Lamech was 182 (182 according to the Masoretic Text; 188 according to the Septuagint.Larsson, Gerhard. ‚ÄúThe Chronology of the Pentateuch: A Comparison of the MT and LXX.‚Äù Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 102, no. 3, 1983, pp. 402. www.jstor.org/stable/3261014.) years old at the birth of Noah and lived for another 595595 according to the Masoretic Text; 565 according to the Septuagint.

With such numbers in this genealogical account, Adam would still have been alive for about the first 56 years of Lamech's life. Prophetic naming When Lamech named his son Noah, he prophesied: \\"This [same] shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the hath cursed.\\" () The people were cumbered with the toil of cultivating a ground that had been cursed in , and they hoped for relief through Noah. Albert Barnes noted: \\"In stating the reason of the name, they employ a word which is connected with it only by a second remove. ◊†◊ï÷º◊ó n√ªach and ◊†◊ó◊ù nƒÅcham are stems not immediately connected; but they both point back to a common root ◊†◊ó (n-ch) signifying 'to sigh, to breathe, to rest, to lie down.Barnes' notes Genesis 5:29 At Noah's sacrifice in the new world after the flood, the said, \\"I will not again curse the ground any more for man‚Äôs sake; for the imagination of man‚Äôs heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\\" References Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Bereshit (parsha) Category:Noah ","title":"Lamech (father of Noah)"},{"id":"27075675","text":"Menegazzia subsimilis is a species of lichen in the family Parmeliaceae It is found scattered across the world, including Oceania (Hawaii, Solomon Islands), Asia (Japan, Papua New Guinea, Russia), Europe (Austria, Germany, Portugal), South America (Ecuador, Peru), the Caribbean (Dominican Republic, Jamaica) and North America (Canada, USA).

The 14th infantry division with its brigades posted at Comilla (53rd), Dhaka (57th), Rangpur (23rd) and Jessore (107th) was the only Pakistani unit in East Pakistan prior to March 1971.

Indian Eastern Command draft plan of operations in Bangladesh in May 1971. A generic representation, some unit locations are not shown. Indian Army Eastern Command draft plan: May 1971 Indian Eastern Command began drafting an operational plan for military action in Bangladesh from May 1971. Indian planners assumed that Pakistani army would try to defend the whole of the province to prevent Mukti Bahini from establishing the government inside Bangladesh.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp56- pp57 The main objectives of the May draft plan were:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp60 *The capture of Dhaka was the final goal. *A winter campaign would reduce the chance of Chinese intervention as passes over the Himalayas would be snowed shut and the ground in Bangladesh would be firm and most favourable for armour and mechanised movements. Some troops deployed on the Chinese border can be used in Bangladesh. *October ‚Äì April period was the best time to launch an offensive, while the Monsoon rains (May ‚Äì September) turned the country into a morass.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp60 *Axis of advance should aim to isolate and bypass Pakistani forces ‚Äì which meant a minimum superiority in numbers was needed. Fortified positions should be bypassed. *Subsidiary objectives should be picked to occupy communication centres and destroy Pakistani command and control ability. *Preliminary operations (by Mukti Bahini and then Indian forces) should aim to draw the Pakistani forces near the border, so key areas in the interior are left undefended. =Proposed axis of advance= Eastern Command had concluded that The major rivers divided Bangladesh into 4 sectors:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp60 North ‚Äì Western Sector (Pakistani designation Northern Sector):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62, pp75 The area north of the Padma and west of the Jamuna river. Bogra was the main communication hub and the sector is connected to the western sector through the Hardinge Bridge. The Shiliguri corridor, which is vital for road and rail communication with Eastern India, borders the northern tip of this sector. A division size attack along the Hili ‚Äì Gaibandha axis, expected to be heavily defended, aimed to capture Bogra. Later an alternative road was identified, and it was decided to launch a secondary attack on Hili while the main attack bypassed Hili, along the Parvatipur ‚Äì Phulbari ‚Äì Pirganj ‚Äì Palashbari ‚Äì Bogra axis.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp67 Two brigade groups were to operate from Shiliguri area and from Cooch Bihar as needed.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62 Western Sector (Pakistani designation Western Sector):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62 This area lies south of the Padma and west of the Meghna. The main communication hub is Jessore, along with Jhenaidah and Magura, and Khulna is a vital sea port. From Jessore a road runs east to Faridpur, and via ferry it is possible to approach Dhaka. Two divisions were to attack along the Boyra ‚Äì Garibpur ‚Äì Jessore and Darshana ‚Äì Kotchadpur ‚Äì Jhenaidah axis.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp68 The natural thrust lines along the Benapol ‚Äì Jessore and Meherpur ‚Äì Chuadanga ‚Äì Jhenaidah, were expected to be heavily defended and was not considered. An infantry brigade was to move along Murshidabad ‚Äì Kushtia line, capture the Hardinge bridge, then move south to Jhenaidah. Then the whole force would move towards Magura, cross the Madhumati and capture Faridpur. With the help of the Inland Waterways Flotilla, an assault towards Dhaka across the Padma would be launched.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62 North Eastern Sector (Pakistani designation Dhaka Bowl):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp57 This area sits to the east of river Jamuna, north of Padma and west of the Meghna and contains the city of Dhaka. A branch of the Jamuna flows to the north of Dhaka between the Jamuna to the Meghna rivers, while a rail bridge at Bhairab connects this area with the south eastern sector. A division would advance along the Kamalpur ‚Äì Jamalpur ‚ÄìTangail ‚Äì Dhaka axis.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp63 An additional brigade would support the advance while a Para battalion could be airdropped to Tangail to cut off Pakistani forces. South Eastern Sector (Pakistani designation Eastern Sector):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp57 This lies to the east of Meghna, contains Sylhet, Comilla and the main seaport Chittagong. Control over Ashuganj, Chandpur and Daudkandi was vital to approach Dhaka. 3 divisions were to secure the area between Ashuganj and Chandpur, then if possible approach Dhaka by crossing the Meghna using helicopters or ferry ‚Äì whichever was available.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62 Indian Navy would blockade Chittagong. Mukti Bahini support was expected in all phases of the operation. Proposed Force allotment Indian Army HQ initially allocated the 9th infantry division, 4th Mountain division, the 50th Para Brigade (army HQ reserve), and the 340th brigade group for operations in the east alongside whatever forces Indian Eastern Command could assemble. Eastern command proposed the following allocation of forces: 1\\\\. The XXXIII corps would guard the Shiliguri corridor with the 71 Mountain brigade, which could also move against the North Western Sector, while the 20th Mountain division and the 340th brigade would bear the burnt of the fighting. The 3rd armoured brigade can also be employed as needed. 2\\\\. The IV corps (8th, 57th and 23rd mountain divisions) would be responsible for the South Eastern Sector, while a rear HQ looked after Assam, Mizoram, Nagaland and the Chinese border. 3.A new corps (4th Mountain and 9th divisions) was slated for the Western Sector operations. 4\\\\. The 6th Mountain (part of Army HQ reserve designated for operations in Bhutan against Chinese moves) and the 9th Mountain brigade would be used in the North Eastern Sector. Seven divisions, 3 independent brigade groups, one armoured brigade and the Mukti Bahini was earmarked for the draft plan, which was shared with the DMO, Lt. Gen. K.K. Singh. During May ‚Äì November, while Mukti Bahini engaged Pakistani forces, Eastern Command, having never contemplated or anticipated large scale military action against East PakistanHassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara' 71, pp119 began building up logistical infrastructure while army support services (Engineer, Ordnance and Medical) began to build up capacity to sustain a 4 week long campaign. Mukti Bahini plan: July 1971 General M.A.G. Osmani (Commander in Chief Bangladesh Forces) had differences of opinion with the Indian leadership regarding the role of the Mukti Bahini in the conflict. Indian leadership initially envisioned Bengali forces to be trained into a small elite guerrilla force of 8,000 members led by the surviving East Bengal Regiment soldiers operating in small cells around Bangladesh to facilitate the eventual Indian intervention,Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp90 ‚Äì pp91 but the Bangladesh Government in exile and General Osmani favoured the following strategy:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp42 ‚Äì pp44, pp90 ‚Äì pp91Hassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara' 71, pp45 ‚Äì pp46 1.Bengali conventional force would occupy lodgment areas inside Bangladesh and then Bangladesh government would request international diplomatic recognition and intervention. Initially Mymensingh was picked for this operation, but Gen.

Fazal Mukeem, Pakistan's Crisis in Leadership, pp125 Bengali regular forces also attacked BOPs in Mymensingh, Comilla and Sylhet, but the results were mixed.

Nazar Hussain Shah) HQ moved to Bogra, the 23rd (CO Brig. Abdullah Malik, HQ Rangpur), the 205th (HQ Bogra) and the 34th (HQ Nator) brigades were attached to it. The 14th division (CO Maj. Gen. Rahim) HQ stayed at Dhaka, its brigades were at Mymensingh (27th), Sylhet (313th ) and Comilla (117th).

From their bases the army conducted sweep and clearing operations in the neighbouring areas to wipe out insurgents and their supporters. Pakistani forces relied on sudden barrages at selected areas to interdict Mukti Bahini infiltration. Pakistanis also build up an intelligence network to collect information on Mukti Bahini activity and sent informers across the border to give early warning of Mukti Bahini activity.Quereshi, Maj.

Against a conventional Indian attack with 3:1 superiority in numbers and enemy dominance of the air and sea, Pakistani forces in Bangladesh would probably be able to last for a maximum of 3 weeks.Major Nasir Uddin, Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp73 *The whole province should not be defended, troops should not be deployed along the border or along the \\"Forward line (running north from Khulna-Jessore-Jhenida-Rajshahi- Hili-Rangpur, then east to Jamalpur-Mymensingh-Bhairab-Sylhet, then south to Comilla-Chittahong).Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman., How Bangladesh Got Divided, pp114 ‚Äì pp118 *Priority should be given to defend the \\"Dhaka Bowl\\" (North ‚ÄìEastern Sector to the Indians) in general and the city of Dhaka should be held at all costs.Ali, Maj.

AAK, The Betrayal of East Pakistan , pp85 in light of the prevailing circumstances and left the plan basically unchanged. The following assumptions were made while re-evaluating the plan:Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A., The 1971 Indo ‚ÄìPak War A Soldier's Narrative, pp121 *The main Indian thrust would come from the east, not the west as assumed in the earlier plan. Indian army would attack to take control over the area between Sylhet ‚Äì Chandpur, while a secondary attack would be aimed at Rangpur ‚Äì Bogra and at Mymensingh. At least 5 Indian infantry divisions, supported by an armoured brigade would launch the attack. The main objective of the Indian attack was to occupy as much territory as possible to set up the Bangladesh government in exile inside the province. *Indians would take the initiative to start the war. By this time, the insurgency situation would have improved and Eastern Command would be ready for both internal and external threats. If not, internal security measures have to be taken to contain the insurgency. *All communication links would be fully functional and under government control to facilitate the movement of troops according to the plan. Conceptually the new plan was the same as the old one, Pakistani units were to fight a series of defensive battles in their deployment areas before taking position to defend the Dhaka Bowl, every inch of the province would not be defended. Gen. Niazi added the following to plan:Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman., How Bangladesh Got Divided, pp89 *Pakistani army to launch attacks towards Tripura, Calcutta or the Shiliguri corridor if needed. *Take over as much Indian territory if possible when opportunity arises. No wargames were conducted to factor in the new directives or specific plans were drawn up to attain these objectives. The revised plan was sent to Rawalpindi and approved in August 1971. Pakistan army probably enjoyed their most peaceful period during the occupation of Bangladesh in 1971 between Late May and mid July, when Mukti Bahini was reorganising and the Indian army was implementing Operation Jackpot in their support. Indian Army High Command plan of operations in Bangladesh in August 1971. A generic representation, some unit locations are not shown. Indian Army HQ Plan: August 1971 The draft plan of Lt. Gen K.K Singh, DMO of Indian army was presented to Eastern Command in August 1971. The strategic assumptions and objectives of this plan were as follows:Singh, Maj. Gen. Sukhwant, The Liberation War of Bangladesh, Vol 1, pp68 ‚Äìpp69 *India can only assemble the 7/8 divisions needed for a successful operation in Bangladesh during winter, when the Chinese army would be immobilised.Singh, Maj. Gen. Sukhwant, The Liberation War of Bangladesh, Vol 1, pp26 The expected Chinese response would probably occur in the Chumbi valley in Sikkim north of the Shiliguri corridor ‚Äì which would pin down Indian forces away from Bangladesh.Hassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara' 71, pp145 quoting Lt. Gen. B.N Kaul, The Times, 9 November 1971 *Priority should be given to strike/occupy airports, port, ferries, and bridges to isolate Pakistani units from one another, then occupy communication hubs to neutralise the mobility of Pakistani units. *Maximum destruction of Pakistani forces and occupation of territory was the primary objectives.Lehl, Maj. Gen. Lachhman Singh, Victory in Bangladesh, pp61 *As soon as feasible ‚Äì move to quickly occupy Dhaka. However, Gen. K.K. Singh did not think it was feasible to occupy Dhaka with the forces available or within 21 days, the time span envisioned to complete all operations in Bangladesh.Singh, Maj. Gen. Sukhwant, The Liberation War of Bangladesh, Vol 1, pp26 The gist of the DMO Plan, presented to Eastern Command in August 1971, was: North ‚Äì Western Sector:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp67 ‚Äì pp68 The XXXIII corps (OC Lt. Gen. Thapan) would launch the 20th division attack along the Hili ‚Äì Ghoraghat ‚ÄìGaibandha axis to cut the area in two. The 71st brigade group would launch an attack along the Thakurgaon ‚Äì Dinajpur axis along both banks of the Atrai River, while another brigade attacked along the Lalmunirhut ‚Äì Rangpur axis. After reaching Gaibandha, a group from the 20th division would move south towards Bogra, while the 71st and 20th occupied Dinajpur, Saidpur and Rangpur. Western Sector:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp68 The newly created II corps (OC Lt. Gen. Tappy Raina) would launch the 4th Mountain and the 9th infantry divisions along the Darshana ‚Äì Jibannagar ‚Äì Jhenaidah and the Benapol ‚Äì Jessore axis against Pakistani 9th division. A group from the 4th mountain would move along Meherpur ‚ÄìKushtia axis to occupy Hardinge bridge, then move to Jhenaidah. From Jhenaidah the 4th Mountain would move east to Magura, while the 9th moved south to occupy Khulna. North Eastern Sector: The 101st Communication zone would move a division along the Kamalpur ‚Äì Jamalpur ‚ÄìTangail ‚Äì Dhaka axis and take control of the area north of the Brahmaputra river. No troops were allocated for operations against Dhaka. South Eastern Sector:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp66, pp68 The IV corps (OC Lt. Gen. Sagat Singh) would attack with 3 divisions. The 8th Mountain would move along the Shamshernagar ‚Äì Moulvibazar axis, and contain Sylhet. The 57th Mountain would capture Comilla and then occupy the area between Chandpur and Daudkandi. The 23rd would occupy the Feni ‚ÄìLaksham area then moves south to capture Chittagong. Gen. Sam Manekshaw, Lt. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora (OC eastern Command) and Lt. Gen. K.K. Singh all held the opinion that with the fall of Khulna and Chittagong, the primary seaports, Pakistani forces isolated inside the Dhaka bowl would capitulate. Lt. Gen. Jacob, COS Eastern Command disagreed and insisted that forces for the capture of Dhaka should be allocated while the Indian Eastern Fleet, vastly superior in numbers, could easily blockade the ports. Gen. Jacob was over-ruled.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp66 ‚Äì pp67 The DMO had assumed that India did not have adequate forces to liberate Dhaka within the allotted time span, so the objective was to liberate the maximum amount of territory.Singh, Maj. Gen. Sukhwant, The Liberation War of Bangladesh, Vol 1, pp72 Since this plan did not assumed India attacking with a 3:1 advantage in numbers against the assumed 4 Pakistani infantry divisions in Bangladesh, Gen. K.K Singh envisioned the Mukti Bahini helping to fill the gap in strength as follows: *Decrease the combat capability of the Pakistani army in Bangladesh, by inflicting casualties, sabotaging installations, disrupting logistics, and decreasing morale and increasing combat fatigue by increasing Mukti Bahini activity along the Indian border and inside the country. * *Take up the responsibility to operate inside the \\"Dhaka Bowl\\" after Indian army had isolated the Pakistani army Indian army had no authority over Mukti Bahini and could only make suggestions to General Osmani. However, Gen Osmani conducted a review of Mukti Bahini activity in September 1971 and put a new plan in place. Mukti Bahini operational setup by November 1971. A generic representation, some unit locations are not shown. =Mukti Bahini Strategy: September re-evaluation= The failure of the so-called Monsoon Offensive brought these facts to light: *Small number of hastily trained guerrillas inside Bangladesh would require time before becoming an effective force. *Bangladesh conventional forces had not acquired the needed manpower and training level to create lodgment areas and without Indian intervention would not have the required air and artillery support to hold onto the liberated areas on their own.Hassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara' 71, pp45 General Osmani thought about dismantling the regular battalions operating under Z, K and S forces and sending platoons from these forces to aid the guerrillas in September, but ultimately did not.Hassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara' 71, pp114 Bangladesh government in exile decided to send 20,000 trained guerrillas into Bangladesh from September onwards,Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp282 on the assumption that even if 1/3 of the force succeeded in it' objective, the effect on the Pakistani forces would be devastating. Indian High Command also stepped up their efforts, beginning from increasing the volume of supplies (arms/ammunition/medicine) in September to having Gen. B.N. Sarkar, DMO Eastern Command and OC Operation Jackpot co-ordinating operations with Bangladesh Forces HQ.Hassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara' 71, pp111 ‚Äì pp112 Gen Sarkar would draw up monthly objectives for Mukti Bahini after consulting with Bangladesh H, then would send a copy of objectives to Mukti Bahini sector commanders and another to adjacent Indian units, thus eliminating the scope of misunderstanding and increasing the co-operation and co-ordination between the forces and ensuring common objectives were targeted. Pakistani deployment and final plan of defence after 19 November 1971 after incorporating Pakistan Army GHQ suggestions. A generic representation, some unit locations are not shown. Final Pakistani Plan: September ‚Äì October 1971 General Niazi, along with General Jamshed (GOC EPCAF), General Rahim ( 2IC Eastern Command), Brig. Bakir (COS Eastern Command), Rear Admiral Sharif and Air Commodore Enam reviewed the existing plan and updated it to factor in the manpower shortage, logistical difficulties, and the directive of the GHQ to defend every inch of East Pakistan.Niazi, Lt. Gen. A.A.K, The Betrayal of East Pakistan, pp110Khan, Maj. Gen. Fazal Muqeem, Pakistan's crisis in Leadership, pp120 The initial assumptions were:Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp123- pp126 *Indian army Eastern Command would use 12 infantry/mountain divisions and an armoured brigade for the invasion under 3 corps commands, supported by Mukti Bahini and BSF units. *Mukti Bahini will step up its activities and try to occupy border areas and if possible occupy a large area of the province adjacent to the border prior to the Indian assault. *The PAF in East Pakistan would last only 24 hours against the IAF eastern contingentSalik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp132 *The main Indian assault would come from the west (opposite Jessore sector) with a subsidiary attack from the east (opposite Comilla sector). *The naval detachment would move into the harbours once hostilities commenced.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp134 *Indian strategic objective is to occupy as much of the province as quickly as possible to set up the Bangladesh government and the Mukti Bahini in the liberated area. Full occupation of the province is not the Indian goal. Gen. Niazi chose the Fortresses concept of defence and the planners decided on a single defensive deployment of troops on the border, which went against the troop deployments advocated by the earlier plans. This was done to stick to the GHQ order of not surrendering any territory to the Mukti Bahini. =Defensive lines= Once the fortress defence was chosen, General Niazi and his staff designated the following cities as fortresses: Jessore, Jhenida, Bogra, Rangpur, Comilla and Bhairab Bazar (these were located on communication hubs), Jamalpur and Mymensingh (defending the northern perimeter of the Dhaka bowl), and Sylhet and Chittagong (independent defence areas). There were 4 lines of defence: 1\\\\. The troops deployed on the border was the forward line ‚Äì this was way in front of the forward line envisioned in the X- Sunderban exercise of 1967 ‚Äì which had deemed the whole border impossible to defend against a conventional attack.Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman., How Bangladesh Got Divided, pp117 ‚Äì pp121 The BoPs were all located on this line. 2\\\\. The Fortresses: All the fortresses were located on this line except Chittagong and Sylhet ‚Äì which were to be independent defensive areas. This was the forward line of the 1967 X-Sunderbans plan and it was also deemed indefensible in its entirety in that exercise. 3.Dhaka Outer Defence Line: Troops from the fortresses were to retreat to this line. The line ran from Pabna in the west to Bera then Sirajganj to the north, then to Mymensing. From Mymensingh the line went south to Bhairab Bazar, from Bhairab it ran southwest along the Meghna to Daudkandi and Chandpur, then ran northwest along Padma then to the Madhumati, along the Madhumati back to Pabna. The fortresses of Bhairab and Mymensingh was part of this line. Pabna, Bera, Chandpur, Daudkandi and Faridpur was to be turned into fortresses, while Kamarkhali, Goalanda, Nagarbari and Narshindi were to be strong points. Faridpur and Narshindi were turned into strong points when the attack was begun in December, the rest of the sites were not built up. 4.Dhaka Inner Defense Line: This ran from Manikganj in the west to Kaliakair, on to Tongi, then to Naryanganj and from Naryanganj back to Manikganj. This area was to have a fortress ‚Äì Naryanganj and strong points at Kalaikair and Tongi. None were developed by December 1971. Having chosen the defensive concept and defensive lines, Pakistan Eastern Command outlined the course of action as follows: *Troops deployed on the border would hold on till ordered to retreat by the GOC *Troops would 'Trade space for time' and fight a delaying action while falling back to the nearest fortress *The fortress would be defended to the last ‚Äì which was understood until a certain amount of time needed for Pakistan to deliver the knockout blow in the west. *The troops formations would fall back to the Dhaka outer line to defend Dhaka as needed. The divisional commanders were authorised to make plans for limited counterattacks in Indian territory to aid in their defensive objectives, which was to maintain control of the main pathways leading into the province. =Assumed enemy axis of attack and Pakistani deployments= Pakistani planners assumed, based on intelligence estimates, that an Indian force of 8 to 12 infantry divisions and an armoured brigade, along with the Mukti Bahini would launch the invasion of East Pakistan in winter. Pakistan army had broadly divided the country into 4 sectors, and the Pakistani deployments were:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp184 ‚Äìpp190Matinuddin, Lt. Gen. Kamal, Tragedy of Errors: East Pakistan Crisis 1968 -1971, pp348 ‚Äì pp350Riza, Maj. Gen Shaukat, Pakistan army 1966 ‚Äì 1971, pp134- pp159 Northern Sector (Indian designation: North Western Sector): This area is to the north of Padma and West of Jamuna rivers, encompassing the Rajhshahi, Pabna, Bogra, Rangpur and Dinajpur districts. Pakistani planners were undecide on whether the Indian attack would come from the Siliguri Corridor south towards Bogra or on the Hili ‚Äì Chilimari axis from southwest to northeast to cut the area in two. The 16th Infantry division (CO Maj. Gen. Nazar Hussain Shah, HQ Bogra then Nator) was deployed to counter both possibilities.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp149 The 23rd Brigade (CO brig. S.A Ansari) was to defend the area north of Hili ‚Äì Chilmari axis. The troops were to retreat to Dinajpur, Saidpur and Rangpur from the border areas, while Dinajpur, Saidpur, T-Junction and Thakurgaon were turned into strongpoints. The area north of the Tista River was a separate defence area, where the 25th Punjab, 86th Mujahid, 1 wing EPCAF and the independent heavy mortar battery was located. The 205th Brigade (CO Brig. Tajammul Hossain Malik) would defend the area between Hili (a strongpoint) and Naogaon then fall back to Bogra (fortress) and hold out. Palashbari, Phulchari and Joyporhut were turned into strongpoints. The 34th Brigade (CO Brig. M.A. Nayeem) would look after the area between Rajshahi and Naogaon, and if need would fall back to the Outer Dhaka defence line and defend from Pabna and Bera, both proposed fortresses. In September, an ad hoc brigade was formed in Rajshahi to block the Padma from any enemy riverine operations.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp149 Western Sector (Indian designation: Western Sector): The area south of the Padma and east of the Meghna contained the Khulna, Jessore, Kushtia, Faridpur, Barisal and Patuakhali districts and was defended by the 9th Division (CO Maj. Gen. Ansari) made up of 2 infantry brigades: the 107th (CO Brig. Makhdum Hayat, HQ Jessore), covering the border from Jibannagar to the Sunderbans to the south, and the 57th (CO Brig. Manzoor Ahmed, HQ Jhenida), which covered the border from Jibannagar to the Padma in the north. Pakistani planners assumed three likely axis of advance from the Indian army:Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp140Major Nasir Uddin, Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp243 ‚Äì pp244 *The main attack would come in the Calcutta ‚Äì Banapol ‚Äì Jessore axis. The 107th Brigade was tasked with guarding the Benapol axis. *Another thrust would be made either using the Krishnanagar ‚Äì Darshana ‚Äì Chuadanga axis, or the Murshidabad ‚Äì Rajapur ‚Äì Kushtia axis. The 57th Brigade (18th Punjab and 29th Baloch) was deployed to cover the Darshana and Meherpur area. To defend the Hardinge Bridge, a tank squadron was placed under Eastern Command control near Kushtia. In September, an ad hoc brigade, the 314th,Niazi, Lt. Gen. A.A.K, The Betrayal of East Pakistan, pp113 (CO Col. Fazle Hamid, one Mujahib battalion, and 5 companies each from EPCAF and Razakars) was created to defend the city of Khulna.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp139 The 57th and 107th brigades were to defend the border then fall back to Jhenida and Jessore, and prevent the enemy from crossing the Jessore ‚ÄìJhenida road, which runs almost parallel to the border. The brigades also had the option to fall back across the Madhumati river, which formed part of the Dhaka outer defrense line, and defend the area between Faridpur, Kamarkhali and Goalanda. The 14th Division initially had 4 brigades: the 27th (CO Brig. Saadullah Khan, HQ Mymensingh), 313th (Brig Iftikar Rana, HQ Sylhet), the 117th (Brig. Mansoor H. Atif, HQ Comilla) and the 53rd (Brig. Aslam Niazi, HQ Dhaka) and looked after the rest of the province. It was decided in September to make the 14th responsible for the eastern sector encompassing Sylhet, Comilla and Noakhali districts only, while the 36th ad hoc division was remade responsible for the Dhaka Bowl. Dhaka Bowl (Indian designation: North Eastern Sector): Pakistani planners anticipated a brigade size attack on the Kamalpur ‚Äì Sherpur ‚Äì Jamalpur axis and another along the Haluaghat ‚Äì Mymensingh axis.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp181 They deemed this area was impassable because of the hilly terrain on the Indian side and the Modhupur Jungle and the Brahmaputra river to the north of Dhaka. Pakistani deployment in this sector was:Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp314Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender At Dacca, pp85 93rd brigade was responsible for the border area between the Jamuna river and Sunamganj. It developed strong points at Kamalpur, Haluaghat and Durgapur, while Jamalpur and Mymensingh were turned into fortresses. The course of the Brahmaputra rives was designated as the \\"line of no penetration\\". 53rd brigade was posted in Dhaka as command reserveSalik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp127 and was responsible for the Dhaka inner defence line until it was moved to Feni.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp85 Dhaka city also had Razakar, EPCAF and other units that could be deployed for defence of the city. Eastern Sector (Indian designation: South Eastern Sector): This sector included the Chittagong, Noakhali, Comilla and Sylhet districts. The anticipated lines of advance were:Major Nasir Uddin, Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp245Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp159 *Agartala ‚Äì Akhaura ‚Äì Bhairab Bazar axis would be the main thrust, with another attack coming towards Moulvibazar ‚Äì Shamshernagar and third near Comilla. The 14th Division (CO: Maj. Gen. Rahim Khan, then Maj. Gen Abdul Majid Kazi) was initially HQed at Dhaka until the creation of the 36th ad hoc division to cover the Dhaka Bowl, when its HQ moved to Brahmanbaria. Chittagong was designated as an independent defence zone under control of the 97th independent brigade. Also, two ad hoc brigades were created, the 202nd and the 93rd out of the units of the 14th division.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp126, pp159, pp181 The division order of battle after September was:Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp315Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp159, pp163, pp167 202nd ad hoc brigade (CO Brig. Salimullah, HQ Sylhet) was responsible for the border stretching from Sunamganj to the north west of Sylhet to Latu to the east of that city. Sylhet was designated as a fortress.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp167 The 313rd Brigade (CO Brig. Iftekhar Rana), Hqed at Moulvibazar, which was developed as a strong point and the unit was responsible for the border between Latu and Kamalganj. After resisting the expected enemy thrust along the Moulvibazar ‚Äì Shamshernagar front, the brigade was to move south and link up with the 27th Brigade near Brahmanbaria. Gen Niazi also envisioned this brigade launching an assault inside Tripura if possible.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp163, pp167 The 27th Brigade (CO Brig. M. Saadullah) was responsible for covering the border between Kamalganj and Kasba, just north of Comilla, and would block the expected main enemy axis of advance, with strong points at Akhaura and Brahmanbaria. Brig. Saadullah anticipated a 3 pronged assault on his area around Akhaura and planned to ultimately fall back to Bhairab, which was the nearest fortress and part of the Dhaka outer defence line. The 117th Brigade (CO Brig. S.M. Attif, Hqed at Mainamati) was responsible for the border between Kasba to the north of Comilla (a fortress) to Belonia in Noakhali. It was to concentrate near Comilla in the event of an Indian advance, then fall back to Daudkandi and Chhandpur, which were part of the Dhaka outer defence line and designated \\"Fortresses\\". The 97th independent Infantry Brigade (CO Brig. Ata Md. Khan Malik, HQ Chittagong) was to cover the Chittaging fortress and Chittagong hill tracks. =Last Minute Changes: November 1971= GHQ Rawalpindi approved in October 1971 and also gave permission to conduct offensive operations against English Bazar or Balurghat in West Bengal and sending SSG commandos to destroy the Farrakka barrageSalik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp125 39th Ad hoc division In November Gen. Niazi split the 14th division, keeping the 202nd, 27th and the 313rd brigades under it. The 117th, 53rd and the 91st brigades were placed under the newly created 39th ad hoc division (CO Maj. Gen. Rahim, Hq Chandpur) with the following responsibilities: 117th Brigade was to cover the area from Kasba to the north of Comilla to Chauddagram to the south. After fighting at the border the force was to redeploy around the Mainamati fortress and then fall back to defend Daudkandi, which was on the Dhaka Outer defence line. The 53rd brigade was transferred from Dhaka to guard the border from Chaddagram to Belonia. This brigade was to fall back to Chandpur, a fortress located on the Dhaka outer defence line after its initial defence of Feni and Laksham. 91st ad hoc brigade (CO Mian Taskinuddin, HQ Chittagong) was to guard the Belonia ‚Äì Ramgarh area. It was to fall back to Chittagong after defending the area. Final Mitro Bahini operational plan in November 1971. A generic representation, some unit locations are not shown. Final Mitro Bahini Plan: November 1971 The Indian Army HQ plan of August was modified by Eastern Command during October ‚Äì November and operational instructions were given to various formations. The final plan did not target Dhaka as the main objective,Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp76 and a contingency scheme to quickly withdraw at least 2 divisions and redeploy against possible Chinese moves was also incorporated.Nasir Uddin, Maj (ret.), Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp226 Mukti Bahini conventional forces were attached to various Indian formations while Mukti Bahini guerrillas not yet deployed inside Bangladesh were formed into infantry companies as auxiliary units. North ‚Äì Western Sector (Pakistani designation Northern Sector):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62, pp75 The XXXIII corps (OC Lt. general Thapan) was given the 20th Mountain division (initially deployed in near Tibet border),Nasir Uddin, Maj (ret.), Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp226 the 71st and 471st Engineer brigade group, 340th (redeployed from Rajasthan)Nasir Uddin, Maj (ret.), Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp226 and 9th Mountain brigades and the 3rd armoured brigade. Pakistani 16th division defended this sector. Lt. Gen. Aurora preferred a brigade size attack along the Hili ‚Äì Gaibandha axis, while other brigades would fan out to the north and south to occupy major towns. Gen. Thapan preferred to bypass Hili and move to Gaibandha using an alternate route using two brigades.Nasir Uddin, Maj (ret.), Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp259 The final draft plan was: *The 71st brigade group (redeployed from Nagaland) and Mukti Bahini would advance south from Panchagarh towards Dinajpur along both banks of Atrai river. *The 340th brigade would operate in the area south of Dinajpur, while occupation of Dinajpur and Rangpur, objectives of the August plan, was dropped. *The 20th Mountain division (redeployed from Tibet border) would use the 202nd brigade against Pakistani positions at Hili, while the 66th brigade bypassed Hili along the Phulbari ‚Äì Pirganj ‚Äì Gobindaganj ‚Äì Bogra axis, thus splitting apart Pakistani forces in the sector. The 165th brigade was in reserve securing Balurghat and would support either brigade if needed. *A Mixed brigade of Mukti Bahini (Sector no 7) and BSF would advance along the Malda ‚Äì Nawabganj ‚Äì Rajshahi axis. *The 9th Mountain brigade and Mukti Bahini (Sector no 6) would occupy the area north of Tista and then move south to Rangpur. Lt. Gen. Aurora made two changes: He ordered Gen. Thapan to make the Hili ‚ÄìGaibandha the main thrust line and the capture of Rangpur one of the objectives despite objections of Gen. Thapan and Jakob.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62, pp75 Western Sector (Pakistani designation Western Sector):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp62 This sector was defended by Pakistani 9th division. The newly created II Corps (4th Mountain and 9th Infantry divisions) along with Mukti Bahini was deployed against this sector. The plan was: *Mukti Bahini Sectors 8 and 9 would attack along the Satkhira ‚Äì Khulna axis, assisted by units of the Bengal Area corps. *The 9th division initially planned to attack along the Benapol ‚Äì Jessore axis. At Gen. Jacob's suggestion, the main thrust was set along the Boyra ‚Äì Garibpur ‚Äì Jessore axis while a secondary attack would be made along the Benapol ‚Äì Jessore line. *The role of the 4th Mountain division was hotly debated by Gen. Jacob and Raina. Gen. Jacob wanted the division to attack along the Shikarpur ‚Äì Jhenida axis with a secondary attack along the Meherpur ‚Äì Kushtia axis to capture the Hardinge bridge, an objective selected by the Army HQ.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp68 Gen Raina preferred to keep the division close to the 9th and wanted to move along the Darshan ‚ÄìJibannagar ‚ÄìKotchandpur axis with a secondary thrust along the Jibannagar ‚Äì Chuadanga axis. Gen Riana got his way when Indian army activity alerted Pakistani forces about the possible Indian thrust along the Shikarpur ‚Äì Jhenida line.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp68 After isolating Jessore and Jhenaidah, the 9th division was to send a brigade to capture Khulna, while a brigade from the 4th Mountain would move north to take Kushtia and Hardinge bridge. The rest of the force was to head east to capture Magura and Faridpur, then cross the Padma and move on Dhaka. North Eastern Sector (Pakistani designation Dhaka Bowl):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp76 ‚Äì pp77 Eastern Command was not allocated the 6th Mountain division or the HQ of the 2nd Mountain division for this area, so the 101st Communication zone was picked to head operations in this sector.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp76 ‚Äì pp77 Pakistani 36th ad hoc division defended this area. Indian plan of attack was: *The FJ brigade (Mukti Bahini Sector 11 and BSF units) would attack Durgapur and Haluaghat and move towards Mymenshingh. *The 95th brigade group would move along the Kamalpur ‚Äì Bakshiganj ‚Äì Jamalpur axis. After crossing the Brahmaputra, Jamalpur would be isolated, then the Indian force, aided by Kaderia Bahini would move to Tangail.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp77 *A Para battalion would be air dropped in Tangail. After securing Tangail, Mitro Bahini would move towards Dhaka, reinforced by 2/3 brigades not designated in the plan. Mukti Bahini was expected to start an uprising in Dhaka to aid the advancing forces.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp94 South Eastern Sector (Pakistani designation Eastern Sector):Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp57 Pakistani 14th infantry and 39th ad hoc divisions defended this sector. Mukti Bahini sectors 1 ‚Äì 5, K and S force brigades and Indian IV corps was selected to operate in this sector. The plan was: *Echo Force brigade (Mukti Bahini Z force brigade, BSF units, Mukti Bahini Sector #5) would advance on Sylhet from the north from several directions. *8th Mountain division (redeployed from Mizoram) would move the 81st mountain brigade along Shamshernagar ‚Äì Moulvibazar and the 59th Mountain brigade would advance along the Kulaura ‚Äì Fenchuganj axis with Mukti Bahini sector no 4. The 81st was to secure the Sherpur and Shadipur ferry and then become the corps reserve while the 59th moved north to Sylhet. *57th Mountain division (redeployed from Nagaland) would attack in Akhaura ‚ÄìBrahmanbaria area. The 61st brigade and would secure the area north of Comilla and contain the city. The 311th mountain brigade would attack to the north of Akhaura towards Ashuganj while the 73rd brigade would attack from the south along the Akhaura ‚Äì Brahmanbaria axis. Mukti Bahini S force brigade would attack towards Ashuganj moving in the area north of the 311th brigade. The 61st Mountain brigade would attack the area north of Comilla and push towards Daudkandi, while a part of its force contained the Comilla garrison. The objective was to occupy the area up to the Meghna river between Daudkandi and Ashuganj while containing Comilla. *23rd Mountain division (redeployed from Himalaya border) was to use the 301st Mountain brigade to occupy Comilla airport, then move along the Comilla ‚Äì Mudafferganj ‚Äì Chandpur axis to secure Chandpur. The 181st brigade was to secure Laksham ‚Äì Chauddugram area before moving on Noakhali ‚Äì Chandpur. Kilo force brigade (Mukti Bahini sector no 1, K force brigade and Indian units) was to move from Belonia to Feni then south along the Comilla ‚Äì Chittagong road towards Chittagong. The 83rd Mountain brigade was kept in reserve to be used as needed. The main responsibility of the IV core along with Mukti Bahini sector no 2 and 3 were to secure the area between Ashuganj and Chandpur, contain Comilla and then if possible approach Dhaka by crossing the Meghna using helicopters or river ferries ‚Äì whichever was available.Jacob, Lt.

Biography Neidhardt was born in Zagreb on October 15, 1901. He studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, under Peter Behrens and gained a diploma in 1924. During his studies in Vienna he made an interesting project for the airport. From 1930 to 1932 he worked for Behrens in Berlin and between 1932 and 1936 was the only paid assistant in the Paris studio of Le Corbusier. During this period Neidhardt was involved in several major projects, including a department store located in Alexanderplatz, Berlin. He was also a recipient of second prize in a competition for the Yugoslav Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, Paris (1937). He returned to Zagreb in 1937 where he designed the Theological School for the Zagreb Diocese. He then moved to Sarajevo in 1939 and remained there until the end of his life. His decision to move to Sarajevo is greatly attributed to Du≈°an Grabrijan, a Slovenian-Bosnian architect, who coauthored a book with Neidhardt called Architecture of Bosnia and voyage to modern. Neidhardt became a professor (1953) at the Architectural Faculty at the University of Sarajevo. Architecture in Bosnia and its regional characteristics preoccupied Neidhardt for the rest of his life. His principal works included low-cost housing estates, for example at Vare≈°, Zenica and Ljubija, and, more prominently, the Philosophy Faculty (1955-9), the Institute of Physics and Chemistry (1959‚Äì64; both of which were heavily damaged in 1994) as well as the urban plan (1954) for the centre of Marindvor, all in Sarajevo. His buildings and major urban schemes were all marked with the synthesis of traditional building elements and modern technological and artistic developments, with a strong emphasis on the integration of architecture with landscape. Neidhardt's most significant architectural works include works on the ski house at Trebeviƒá, Faculty of Philosophy, Chemical-Physical Institute, House of Scouts (Dom Izviƒëaƒça) in Sarajevo, the urban core solution at Marindvor in Sarajevo, Parliament building of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The main launch of the study took place on 22 April 2010; 2.4 million UK mobile phone users were invited to participate. As of August 2010, 67,987 people were taking part in the UK arm of the study. From February 2012 the UK study changes its eligibility criteria so that invitations were no longer mandatory to participate. Anyone aged 18 or over, who is a UK resident and uses a mobile phone can take part in the study. To take part visit the study website at www.ukcosmos.org. Initial study results will be published in 5 years. Data Protection The Information Commissioner has advised that this research study complies fully with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998. All individually identifiable data will be dealt with in the strictest confidence. The results of the study will be published following independent review but no individually identifying data will ever be published. Access to data is limited to the academic research team who are required to sign strict non- disclosure agreements. Background Mobile phones have been in widespread use for a relatively short period of time. There are currently more than six billion users of mobile phones worldwide and in the UK there are over 70 million mobile phone devices in use. It is important for current users, and for future generations, to find out whether there are any possible long-term health effects from this new and widespread technology. Many reviews have concluded that there is no convincing evidence to date that mobile phones are harmful to health. However, the widespread use of mobile phones is a relatively recent phenomenon and it is possible that adverse health effects could emerge after years of prolonged use. Evidence to date suggests that short term (less than ten years) exposure to mobile phone emissions is not associated with an increase in brain and nervous system cancers. However, regarding longer term use, the evidence base necessary to allow firm judgments to be made has not yet been accumulated. There are still significant uncertainties that can only be resolved by monitoring the health of a large cohort of phone users over a long period of time. A major report on mobile phones and health was published by the UK Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones in 2000, known as the 'Stewart report ‚Äô.Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones This report was updated by a further review of mobile phones and health undertaken by the Advisory Group on Non-Ionizing Radiation (AGNIR )Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields, , National Radiology Protection Board, Volume 14, No. 2, 2003. and published by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) in 2005. Most recently, the independent Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research programme (MTHR), established in 2001 following the ‚ÄòStewart Report‚Äô, published a reportMobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme: report 2007. Health Protection Agency, 2007 describing research undertaken as part of its programme. None of the research supported by the MTHR programme and published so far demonstrates that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones. The report also summarizes the current evidence base regarding mobile phones and health and identifies priorities for future research. The COSMOS study aims to carry out long term health monitoring of a large group of people to identify if there are any health issues linked to long term mobile phone use. Through this health monitoring, current uncertainties about possible long term health effects associated with this new technology can be resolved. This research has been endorsed as a priority by agencies worldwide, including the Department of Health (United Kingdom), the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA), the UK Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR), the European Union‚Äôs Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENHIR), and the World Health Organization (WHO). Following the publication of the Stewart report by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones in 2000, an independent research programme, called the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR), was set up in the UK to look into the possible health impact of Mobile Telecommunications. The most recent report from the MTHR concluded that: Funding The UK COSMOS study, previously funded by the MTHR (an independent programme of research into mobile phones and health that was jointly supported by the Department of Health and industry), is now jointly funded by industry and government under the Research Initiative on Health and Mobile Telecommunications (RIHMT), and is managed through the Department of Health‚Äôs Policy Research Programme.

'Trophy Hunting' was shortlisted for the 2019 Taylor & Francis Outstanding Book and Digital Product Award in the Outstanding Professional Category. ‚ÄòThe Psychology of Language and Communication‚Äô was republished in the Routledge Classic Editions series,https://www.routledge.com/Psychology-Press--Routledge- Classic-Editions/book-series/PPCLASSICS thirty years after it first appeared. ‚ÄòSurvivors of Steel City‚Äô formed the basis for the documentary film ‚ÄòTales from a Hard City‚Äôhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111355/ (director: Kim Flitcroft) which won the Grand Prix at the Marseilles Film Festival and the Best Regional Film in the Indies Award. Beattie was credited as story consultant on the film. Beattie has also published two novels ‚Äì ‚ÄòThe Corner Boys‚Äô (Victor Gollancz) and ‚ÄòThe Body‚Äôs Little Secrets‚Äô (Gibson Square). ‚ÄòThe Corner Boys‚Äô, the story of a teenager growing up in a loyalist working-class neighbourhood of Belfast during the Troubles, was also shortlisted for the Ewart-Biggs Literary Prize . ‚ÄòThe Body‚Äôs Little Secrets‚Äô is the story of a social psychologist, Matt, whose research centres on the analysis of body language. The novel situates the action in Sheffield in Thatcher‚Äôs Britain of the early nineteen-eighties, just after the miners‚Äô strike with the mines and the steelworks closing. Self-construction is the nature of the day, trying still to be somebody in desperate times. Matt himself is trying to make a name for himself as an academic in this changing societal landscape but oversteps the mark in his claims about what his body language analyses can reveal from CCTV footage of a murder, to his ultimate cost. In a review in the international journal Semiotica,https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/psychology/files/2018/08/Semiotica- Fiction-as-semiotics.pdf Professor Marcel Danesi, Professor of Semiotics at the University of Toronto, described the book as a ‚Äòtruly outstanding work‚Äô and wrote that ‚ÄòWith his latest novel, Dr Geoffrey Beattie can now be projected onto the same international platform as the late Umberto Eco, who became famous for integrating semiotic theory with fiction, starting with his bestseller, The Name of the Rose...There is little doubt, in my estimation at least, that Geoffrey Beattie is Eco‚Äôs successor, displaying an uncanny and ingenious ability to blend his insightful work on nonverbal semiotics with an exceptional sense for narrative in this outstanding roman-√†-clef.‚Äô Research Beattie‚Äôs research falls within the broad areas of embodied cognition/multi-modal communication and applied social psychology particularly in the areas of sustainability and race where he researches the relationship between explicit and implicit processes, and the societal implications of any possible ‚Äòdissociation‚Äô here. =Multi-Modal Communication= His long- standing interest in human multi-modal communication focuses on the interaction between language and nonverbal communication in talk. He was awarded the Spearman Medal by the British Psychological Society for ‚Äòpublished psychological research of outstanding merit‚Äô for work in this area. His research shows that both verbal and nonverbal elements are critical to everyday semantic communication and that iconic hand gestures reflect unarticulated aspects of thinking. He has explored the possible applications of this theoretical perspective for both advertising and for deception, where gesture-speech mismatches may occur, along with structural changes in the phases of gestures. This research won the international Mouton d‚ÄôOr prize for the best research paper in semiotics. =Sustainability= He has also explored the psychological barriers that prevent consumers adopting more sustainable lifestyles in the light of the threat posed by climate change. He has challenged the established orthodoxy in this field. DEFRA, and others, have argued that the promotion of more sustainable behaviour is essentially just an ‚Äòinformational‚Äô issue because the public already have the right underlying attitudes to environmental issues like carbon footprint (measured using various self-report instruments). For this reason, carbon labels were introduced. Beattie‚Äôs experimental research, using eye tracking, showed that there was minimal visual attention to carbon labels and that explicit self- reported attitudes to carbon footprint did not actually predict visual attention to climate change images. Measures of implicit attitude, where such attitudes are largely unconscious and measured through speed of association, were, however, better predictors of both attentional focus and behavioural choice under certain conditions. Dispositional optimism also seems to affect visual attention to climate change images and this links to optimism bias (He presented this research at the British Academy Summer Showcase in 2018 where the best research funded by the B.A. is highlighted).https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/BritishAcademyReview33-Summer2018.pdf He has explored new segmentation analyses of consumer markets based upon the intersection of explicit and implicit attitudes and researching how to change both types of attitude, necessary to produce the radical shift in consumer behaviour required to combat climate change. Beattie presented this research on sustainability at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change at UNESCO headquarters in Paris in July 2015, and with Laura McGuire contributed a chapter to the United Nations International Commission on Education for Sustainable-Development-Practice Report (a report issued every ten years by the U.N. to define priorities in education internationally for the next decade), to be published in 2019. =Implicit Racial Bias= Another strand of his current research is into implicit racial bias and its effects on everyday life. He has explored how implicit racial attitudes impact on shortlisting decisions. He has shown how gaze fixations, as we consider CVs, are influenced by our implicit attitudes, and he has investigated how these impact on the representations that we build up of the various candidates under consideration, thereby influencing our final ‚Äòrational‚Äô decision about the relative suitability of the candidates. He has researched how people justify and rationalise their everyday decisions that often result from processes that are more implicit. Using the terminology of the Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman, he has explored how System 1 and System 2 interact in everyday life and the implications of this interaction for both behaviour and talk. He has given a number of significant keynote addresses on this theme at a variety of applied conferences, including the Annual Conference of the Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, the Asian Fire Service Association National Conference, the Equality Challenge Unit Biennial Conference, the Respect Difference Conference, Police Service of Northern Ireland etc. The overarching focus of his research has been on how human beings communicate and make decisions in their everyday social worlds, with emphasis on the more unconscious and implicit aspects of these everyday processes. He has been interested, throughout his career, in the real-world relevance of his research. Outreach Beattie was President of the Psychology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 2005-6 and has given many keynote addresses to a range of audience, including public lectures at Gresham College, the International Psychology Conference in Dubai, the Psychology Teacher National Conference, the European Conference on Psychology and the Behavioral Sciences, Techkriti, the Annual Technical and Entrepreneurial Festival Kanpur, India, both Houses of Parliament through the Westminster Food and Nutrition Forum, the Star lecture at the University of Manchester etc. He has also spoken at various music and book festivals including ‚ÄòThe Secret Garden Party‚Äô, ‚ÄòShambala‚Äô, Latitude and the Edinburgh, Munich and Cheltenham Book Festivals. Beattie was an external consultant on the Leadership Vanguard (LV) with Paul Polman, then CEO of Unilever, and others. This organisation was designed to help shape the sustainability policy of Unilever and other leading multinationals. He is also well known for bringing analyses of behaviour, and particularly nonverbal communication, to a more general audience by appearing as the on-screen psychologist on eleven series of Big Brother in the U.K. and for explaining how psychology can be used by people in their everyday lives. His work in psychology has been extensively covered in the national and international media. * Geoff Beattie on the body language of Donald Trump during the Presidential debate (Newsweek, 17 October 2016) * Geoff Beattie on the Live Election Debates 2010 (The Mirror, 23 April 2010) * Geoff Beattie on The Perfect Handshake (ABC News) In addition, he has carried out media work on behalf of a range of organizations, including ITV, Universal Pictures, Department for Work and Pensions, NHS, Nivea, Royal Mail, Disney and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Biography Karmni Grima was born in the village of Gƒßarb in Gozo, the sister island of Malta. Her parents, Thomas and Antonia (n√©e Apap), were poor labourers who worked in the fields located on the nearby hills of Ghammar. Every day, after hearing Mass (liturgy) in a small chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Karmni would go to work in the fields. On the 22 June 1883 while, as usual, she was passing in front of the small chapel, she heard a mysterious voice calling her: \\"Come, ... come today. For a whole year, you will not be able to return\\". This event is considered as \\"the most notable occurrence in the history of the Diocese\\"Joseph Bezzina, Religion and Politics in a Crown Colony ( The Gozo-Malta Story 1798-1864), Malta 1985, 333. of Gozo. Karmni Grima, although terrified, obeyed and entered into the chapel. From a painting of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary located in the chapel, Karmni heard a voice saying: \\"Recite three Hail Marys in honour of the three days that I stayed within the tomb.\\" Karmni Grima got sick, and could only return to the chapel after a year. Karmni shared this experience with her confessor of sins and with her friend and neighbour Francesco Portelli. The latter told her that he also heard similar voices. Shortly after this mysterious incident, Francesco's mother was miraculously healed by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Bishop Pietru Pace was informed about these events and after speaking to Karmni and Francesco he concluded that the voice was of heavenly origins. A statue of Karmni Grima outside Ta' Pinu Sanctuary in Gozo, Malta. Within a short time the news spread throughout Gozo and Malta and the small and abandoned chapel soon became a Marian shrine. Many people started to organize pilgrimages in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary and ask for temporal and spiritual favours. This prompted the ecclesiastical authorities to build a sanctuary which would be able to accommodate the crowds that were now daily visiting the small chapel. In 1920 the foundation stone of a modern basilica dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Ta' Pinu was laid. Today the basilica of Ta' Pinu remains a very popular destination for Marian pilgrimages. For the last 15 years of her life, although bed-ridden, Grima was very much at peace with herself and bore her sufferings with patience, fully confident in the will of God.

At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Himar√´.Law nr. 115/2014 Location The village is located at the foothills of the Ceraunian Mountains and is adjacent to the village of Dukat. The area is rugged and mountainous, and is host to many streams and passes. History The origins of the village are tied to the Qafa e Shengjergjit, which was used in ancient times as a caravan route between the ancient city of Orikum and more inland cities. Eventually the trail was forgotten by merchants and is only used by sheepherders in contemporary times. Turkish dominance over the area was minuscule, but taxes in the form of herds and other commodities were taken by the local Ottoman administration. Villagers often ignored the taxes that the local Sanjak in Vlore requested, thus in around the 1820s an Ottoman expeditionary force skirmished with the villagers and stole their goods as compensation for neglect of taxes. The inhabitants of the village were also Islamized during this period, with Bektashism also taking hold in the region later. T√´rba√ß was part of the battlefield of the battle of Gjorm, where Albanian resistance units defeated and routed the troops of the Kingdom of Italy. During World War II the German army was still very active in the area, even as the allies pushed up into northern Italy. Meanwhile, Partisans also were fighting against the Germans and Balli Komb√´tar. The eventual Communist victory led to the village being part of the Albanian Communist state for over fifty years, however after the fall of Hoxhaism, the village has seen a massive drop in population as people migrate to different areas of the world, and in Albania itself.  Notable people  Hysni Kapo, military commander and leading member of the Party of Labour of Albania. Miro T√´rba√ße, Semi-legendary heroin who slew the Sanjak of Vlora in retaliation for the treatment of the village, a statue of her is still in T√´rba√ß.

Early life Obata was born in 1904 in the Tokyo area of Japan, the son of Kyuichi Obata and Toyoko Obata (n√©e Ishiguro). His father owned several silk mills in the region, and moved the family to different towns as demanded by his work. Obata lost two brothers in infancy, and grew up with one younger brother and one younger sister. As a child, he had a great interest in the martial arts, and left it to his brother, Satoru, to prepare to lead the family business eventually. At school, Obata trained in judo, kendo (swordsmanship), and kyudo (archery). Unlike most Japanese boys of the time, he went through several schools, and entered Keio Preparatory School in Tokyo around 1922. A friend gave him a copy of Gichin Funakoshi's first book on karate, and this sparked Obata's interest in the art. Upon completion of his secondary education, Obata gained entry to Keio University. In 1923, Funakoshi accepted a position teaching karate at the university, and Obata was one of the first students in line. He would go on to become one of Funakoshi's senior students. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake struck later that year, destroying most of Tokyo, including Keio University's karate dojo (training hall). The students rebuilt the dojo within a year, however, and training resumed. Kyuichi Obata was too busy with his business to have studied the martial arts himself, but was pleased at his son's commitment to karate; one of the family's ancestors had been Obata Nobusada, a famous samurai, general and governor under the daimy≈ç (feudal lord) Takeda Shingen in the 16th century. Toyoko Obata was a deeply religious Christian and saw the martial arts as contradictory to her beliefs, but never inhibited her son's training. Karate career Obata was captain of the Keio University karate club, and would later teach the art there Over the next few years, Obata assisted Funakoshi with teaching karate at Takushoku University, Waseda University, and Hitotsubashi University (then known as Shoka University). He became the inaugural captain of Keio University's karate club. In 1926, Funakoshi awarded black belt status to his most senior students, including Obata. Obata's father died of a heart attack in 1927. In 1932, Obata travelled to Manchuria, and was to work there for more than 10 years as an economic adviser to the Manchurian Aviation Corporation. He was responsible for flight scheduling and operations. During this time, he taught karate privately to a few friends and students, but turned his focus to kyudo. His mother introduced him to a young woman, Miyako, and the two were married in Tokyo by 1935. In 1940, he returned to Tokyo to represent Manchuria at a kyudo tournament, and won the competition. For a time, he was much better known for his expertise in kyudo than in karate. During the first few months of World War II, Obata was promoted to the rank of 5th dan in Shotokan karate. When Japan entered the war, Obata's brother Satoru joined the Imperial Japanese Army as an officer. S. Obata had practised judo and was ranked 2nd dan in karate. He died in the bitter fighting for Iwo Jima, and this meant that Obata had to return to Japan to look after his mother and sister. His brother's death affected him deeply, for the two had been very close. With the end of the war, the occupying forces suspended all martial arts training in Japan for three years; it was only then that Obata could resume training under Funakoshi. In the meantime, he worked at international trading company Hirano Seiko. On May 27, 1949, Obata, Masatoshi Nakayama, Shigeru Egami, and other colleagues established the Japan Karate Association (JKA) under Funakoshi. Obata was the inaugural Chairman of the JKA, with Funakoshi as Honorary Chief Instructor and Nakayama as Chief Instructor.Noble, G. (1995): Master Funakoshi's Karate: The history and development of the empty hand art, Part III Retrieved on April 23, 2010. In 1954, he left the JKA when the organization became increasingly commercial and militaristic in nature. Along with Nakayama, Hidetaka Nishiyama, and others, he began teaching personnel from the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) who were based in Japan. Through Emilio Bruno of the SAC, whom Obata had earlier met through his work at Hirano Seiko, SAC headquarters invited Obata to visit the US to demonstrate his art. For two months in 1953, he flew from base to base, demonstrating Shotokan karate to US military personnel; he then returned to teaching in Japan. Later life Obata's master, Funakoshi, died in 1957. While Funakoshi had been honorary head of the JKA, Obata felt that the university karate clubs (Keio, Waseda, Takushoku, Hitotsubashi, and Hosei) most faithfully represented the spirit of Funakoshi's karate. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Obata continued teaching karate to SAC personnel at the Kodokan. In 1968, he visited the US again and was honored by his student Tsutomu Ohshima, who had established the Southern California Karate Association. Obata's mother died that year. Another pioneer of karate in California, Dan Ivan, also studied under Obata.Kroll, P. W. (1976): \\"Dan Ivan: Karate's man of many contrasts ‚Äì He is both traditionalist and avid martial arts promoter.\\" Black Belt, 14(9):18‚Äì22, 74, 82. In his final years, Obata lived with his wife in the outskirts of Tokyo, spending his days teaching karate or tending to his garden. While officially retired, he continued teaching four nights and four evenings each week at Keio University and Meiji University. His students presented him with a plaque reading: \\"Like your nickname, Elephant, you are strong, big and gentle. We thank you for the lessons you have taught us.\\" In a 1972 interview, Obata expressed disillusionment with the development of karate, saying, \\"Karate is dying now. It cannot last longer than a few more decades.\\" He died in 1976.Chidokan Karate-Do New Zealand: Historical background (2010). Retrieved on April 23, 2010.

He recorded especially with the G√§chinger Kantorei and Helmuth Rilling, including rarely performed cantatas such as, in 1967, the reconstructed Entfliehet, verschwindet, entweichet, ihr Sorgen, BWV 249a, also called Shepherd cantata.Cantata BWV 249a Entflieht, verschwindet, entweichet, ihr Sorgen on bach-cantatasBach: Entfliehet, Verschwindet, Entweichet / Rilling ArkivMusic Also in 1967 he recorded the bass arias of Bach's St Matthew Passion with Hans Swarowsky, the Vienna Academy Chamber Choir and the Wiener S√§ngerknaben, the Vienna State Symphony Orchestra, Heather Harper and Kurt Equiluz singing both the vox Christi and the arias.J.S. Bach: Matth√§us- Passion on bach-cantatas Jakob St√§mpfli recorded Bach cantatas with Karl Ristenpart, also Bach's Magnificat and two of Bach's Missae breves with Maurice Andr√©, trumpet. A review of Bach cantatas recorded with conductor Fritz Werner credits his singing: \\"The magnificent bass aria, ‚ÄòDer alte Drache brennt vor Neid‚Äô, in which soloist Jakob St√§mpfli is accompanied by timpani and no less than three trumpets, is powerfully conveyed; St√§mpfli is in commanding form\\".Johann Sebastian BACH (1685‚Äì1750) The Cantatas - Volume 2 review by John Quinn on musicweb.international, 2005 In 1963 he recorded Frank Martin's oratorio for soloists, choruses & orchestra In Terra Pax, written in 1944, with Ernest Ansermet conducting the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Jakob St√§mpfli was a teacher at the Conservatory of Biel (1960‚Äì1962) and at the Bern Conservatory for music and theatre from 1963 where he was appointed director in 1992. He has also taught at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Saar in Saarbr√ºcken and the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg. He has given international master classes and served as a judge for vocal competitions. His students have included Klaus Mertens, Siegmund Nimsgern, Cornelius Hauptmann and Dominik W√∂rner. From 2005 until 2007 he directed the festival Bachwochen Thun ‚Äì Amsoldingen.Bachwochen In 2007 the festival presented a performance of Bach's Mass in B minor with the ten singers of the Cantus Firmus Vokalensemble in the church of Amsoldingen.Eine glanzvolle Bach-Messe review in the Thuner Tagblatt, 28 August 2007 (in German) He was acting chairman of the Swiss Music Pedagogic Association.

Ecology High water temperatures (25-27 ¬∞C) have deleterious effects on S. mediterranea populations, while variations in the pH of the water (6.9-8.9) don't seem to have an important influence on the survival of this species. S. mediterranea can be found with associated fauna such as gastropods, bivalves, insects, leeches, and nematodes. Reproduction The sexual specimens of Schmidtea mediterranea produce cocoons between November and April. In May, when water temperature rises above 20 ¬∞C, they lose their reproductive apparatus. Despite this, they don't reproduce asexually (by fissiparity) during the summer months.  Research  Almost any piece from a Schmidtea mediterranea individual can regenerate an entire organism in a few days. This is in part enabled by the presence of abundant pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts. Transplantation of a single neoblast to a fatally injured animal has been shown to rescue the animal An analysis of the genome of S. mediterranea indicated the presence of a previously unknown family of long terminal repeats and the lack of several essential genes, including genes responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids and the MAD1 and MAD2 genes, which were thought to be essential components of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

The periphery of body whorl is gently rounded to meet the rather flattened base. There is no umbilicus. The columella is short, straight, and ending in a slight knob inside the margin of the aperture. The aperture is crenulated by the sculpture, nacreous, obliquely set and subrectangular in form. The sutures are appressed, hardly visible except in the last three whorls. The color of the shell is delicate rosy, the nucleus smooth and white. The base of the shell has about twelve equal revolving ribs consisting of successive rounded nodules, of even size, somewhat like strings of beads. The first, third, and fifth ribs, counting from the columella, show every third bead crimson, the others white. The other basal ribs have the rosy color of the shell, but in the seventh, ninth, and eleventh, each alternate or each third bead has a deeper crimson tint, though this is hardly visible without a glass. On the upper surface of the whorls are (eight in the body whorl) similar beaded ribs, several of which have rosy threads alternating with crimson ones. The general rosy hue is clouded darker and lighter alternately, but in an indefinite way. The sculpture of the whole shell is very uniform.

Description The height of the shell attains 39 mm. The umbilicated shell is large, polished, solid, and contains 8 whorls. It is straw-yellow lineated with red-brown, and has a broad rose-colored peripheral band. The walls of the umbilicus are marked with incremental lines, slightly excavated near the carina, above convex, the convexity revolving with the whorl. The convexity is straw-color, a deep brown band revolving just within the carina. The spiral sculpture outside the carina, which is not very sharp, consists of two strong beaded spirals alternating with two fine simple brown elevated lines. Then follow nine subequal, finer spirals, less coarsely beaded, the upper angle of the aperture being at the ninth. All these are straw-colored with brown interspaces. Then three fine yellow-brown undulated lines, then a larger nodulated peripheral spiral with a smaller similar one on each side of it. These and their interspaces are of a deep rose-pink. Above the pink band is the largest nodulated spiral, followed by (on the body whorl) seven or eight somewhat smaller, alternating larger and smaller, the last separated by a smooth space from the suture. These are all straws-colored with brown interspaces and an occasional intercalary fine line. The radiating sculpture consists only of faint incremental line. The nucleus is lost. The earlier whorls have three nodulated spirals. The base of the shell and the whorls are a little convex. The periphery is evenly rounded. The sutures are distinct. The aperture is ovate. The margin is simple. The columella is concavely arched with a slight angle, not to be called a tooth, formed by the end of the umbilical carina at the base. The Interior is extremely nacreous.

His is the first episcopal resignation in Belgium relating to the sexual abuse of minors.Katholieknederland.nl Vangheluwe's resignation was announced at a press conference by Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard.

In a way, it's not a tougher subject than many others. Yes, it's embarrassing, it's scandalous. But then again, so are many other things [...] Also, there have been some articles that imply that pedophilia is nowhere so little prevalent as in the Church [...]\\".De Standaard, 26 April 2010 As late as 21 April 2010, Vangheluwe had written a column in a regional edition of the Flemish Catholic weekly Kerk en Leven (\\"Church and Life\\"), saying that \\"at present we suffer from the scandals that batter the Church: everywhere there are stories of priests abusing children. It's horrible to see these things surface, and they hurt us deeply.

On 12 April 2011, it was announced that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ruled that Vangheluwe had to leave Belgium and undergo spiritual and psychological treatment. The statement said that \\"he is not allowed any public exercise of priestly and episcopal ministry. The psychological treatment is provided by the Congregation to obtain additional information useful for diagnosis and prognosis, to come to a final decision, which remains the responsibility of the congregation itself, and to be approved by the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope). This decision will of course take into account the different aspects of the issue, beginning with the suffering of the victims and the needs of justice. The process is still ongoing and therefore the decision taken so far by the Congregation is interlocutor and not final.\\" On 14 April 2011, Vangheluwe gave an interview to Flemish TV-station VT4. In the interview, he admitted to abusing another nephew. He also stated that he did not see himself as a pedophile.

The 6¬Ω whorls are convex, the lower ones slightly concave below the suture. The nucleus is rather smooth, next whorls contain from 2 to 4 weak spiral lirae below the suture, crossed by weaker radiating ribs, and with 2 or 3 stronger lirae on the lower part of each whorl, with a faint intermediate one, on the penultimate and the body whorl. The spiral lirae increase in number, to about 10 weaker spirals on the upper part and 4 or 5 stronger ones at the lower part of the upper surface, and numerous intermediate ones. Below the rounded periphery appear two or three more remote lirae, with intermediate ones and numerous, regular, flatter lirae on the convex basal part, becoming broader towards the umbilicus. The whole shell is crossed by oblique, fine, but conspicuous growth-striae. The umbilicus is narrow, in the front view concealed by the columellar margin, with rather smooth walls. The aperture is rounded-quadrangular. The thin upper margin is curved and runs uninterruptedly in the basal margin. The columellar margin is partly reflected over the umbilicus.

Description The size of the shell varies between 6 mm and 16 mm. The shell has a depressed conic shape with a rather acute apex and six whorls. The nucleus is white and delicately sculptured. The remainder of the shell is whitish with faint streaks of brown transverse to the whorls, arranged so as to present the appearance of seven brownish streaks radiating from the apex. Other dots and streaks of brown are irregularly distributed. The upper side of the whorls contain one smooth revolving keel nearly midway between the sutures, but a little nearer the periphery. This gives the whorls a somewhat tabulated aspect. Above this on the body whorl are four smaller more or less beaded or crenulated keels, below it are two without nodosities, reaching the gently rounded periphery. Between these are intercalary threads or grooves. The base of the shell is supplied with nine rounded revolving ribs, those nearer the umbilicus with a tendency to beading. The interspaces are about as wide as the ribs, which are crossed by slight elevations due to lines of growth. The umbilicus is perforate, bordered by a strong white rib. The inner wall is smooth or transversely striate. The columella is emarginate, twisted, not thickened, ending in a round lump above the basal margin of the aperture. The oblique aperture is subrectangular, nacreous, sharp-edged, and crenulated by the ribs.

The general color of the shell is a fleshy tint, varied at intervals with brown blotches which are often pale bordered on the left or anterior side. The lowermost row of granules is smaller than those above. This gives the whorls a channeled appearance at the suture.Edgard A.

The shell has an acute conical shape. It is angulate. The 15 spirals above the angle are much finer than those upon the base. The colour may be variable but in the original greyish white example examined, the brown stripes are divided down the middle by a whitish line. They are slightly undulating and the basal lirae are spotted with the same blackish brown colour. The seven whorls are not quite flat as the rounded keel, which passes above the suture, causes a faint swelling at the lower part. The aperture is subquadrate.

Description (Original description by Hedley & May) The height of the shell attains 7 mm. The small, subperforate shell has a conical shape with sharply keeled periphery, overlapping spire whorls and a flat base. Its colour and number of whorls are uncertain, the latter exceeding six. Sculpture: small spiral threads parted by wider interstices amount to seven on the penultimate, and to twenty on the body whorl. Of these a double row compose the peripheral keel. On either side of the keel the interstices are wider than usual. The radials are irregular oblique wave-like folds, twenty-two on the body whorl, which raise beads on the keel rows, and there cease abruptly. On the base incipient radials bead the inner spirals. The oblique aperture is trapezoidal. The simple outer lip is sharply angled by the periphery. The columella insertion is a little reflected over the minute umbilicus.Hedley & May (1908), Mollusca from one hundred fathoms, seven miles east of Cape Pillar, Tasmania; Records of the Australian Museum v. 7 (1908) (described as Calliostoma retiarium) Distribution This marine species occurs off South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania at depths between 170 m and 180 m.

T. Compton, (29 July 1849 - 22 March 1921) was an English- born, German artist, illustrator and mountain climber. He is well known for his paintings and drawings of alpine scenery, and as a mountaineer made 300 major ascents including no fewer than 27 first ascents. Life Piz Morteratsch, view from Fuorcla Boval on the northern flank (1914) Compton was born in Stoke Newington in London, the son of Theodore Compton, an art-loving insurance agent,Theodore Compton authored \\"A Mendip valley, its inhabitants and surroundings\\" which his son illustrated. and grew up in a deeply religious Quaker household. He attended various art schools, including, for a time, the Royal Academy in London, but otherwise he was mainly self-taught in art. In 1867, wanting the best education for their artistically-talented son, and due to the high cost of schooling in England, the family decided to emigrate to Germany settling in Darmstadt. The city at that time was the seat of the Grand Duchy of Hesse under Grand Duke Ludwig III, and a community of artists had sprung up there. Entries in Compton's diary show that both he and his father were art teachers - Alice, the Princess of Hesse numbered amongst Edward's students.See: Brandes, J & S. E T Compton.Darmstadt Artists' Colony. Between 1867-68 Compton toured the Rhineland, Mosel and Eifel areas of Germany, making numerous sketches. In July 1868, the entire Compton family traveled to the Bernese Oberland, the alpine scenery encountered during this trip, particularly the view of the Eiger, M√∂nch and Jungfrau peaks, inspiring Edward to become a mountain painter.See Wichmann.See E T Compton, a brilliant artist In 1869, Compton was living in Munich and two years later for the first time exhibited his work at the Glass Palace.E T Compton (Ketterer Kunst) In 1872 he married Auguste Plotz and for two years they travelled through the Tyrol, Carinthia, Italy and Switzerland. From 1874, the couple settled in Feldafing on Lake Starnberg, building a comfortable house there called Villa Compton. In the following years, Compton travelled to the mountains of Austria, Scandinavia, North Africa, Corsica and Spain recording his impressions in a variety of oil and watercolors paintings and ink drawings. Although alpine scenes predominated, Compton also visited and drew other areas such as the High Tatras in eastern Europe, the Scottish Highlands, the Hebrides, the Lofoten Islands and Northern Cape in Norway, and the Colombian Andes. In 1880 Compton became a member of the Royal Academy, London. Besides his work as a painter he also became well known as a book illustrator for the German and Austrian Alpine Association (DAV) with titles such as \\"In the high mountains\\" by Emil Zsigmondy (1889), \\"About Fels and Firn\\" by H. Hess (1901) and \\"Mountaineering in Pictures\\" by Alfred Steinitzer (1913). In England he was also in demand as an illustrator providing pictures for a range of titles (see below). Malcesine on Lake Garda Monte Baldo (1913) In 1909 Compton accompanied his friend, the mountaineer Karl Blodig on many tours in the Silvretta mountains. At the time of the First World War he was invited by the Austrian army to paint from the mountain front but was forbidden to do so by the Bavarian High Command. He was also excluded from the Munich Artists' Association, because he was English. Apart from his art, Compton was also an excellent climber, highly regarded by Blodig for his \\"brilliant mountaineering skill on ice and rock, his truly admirable perseverance, his inexhaustible patience in bearing hardships\\". He was a member of the exclusive Alpine Club and the German and Austrian Alpine Association (DAV). Amongst his notable ascents were: Torre di Brenta first climbed in 1882; Cima Brenta, first climbed by the south wall in 1882; Odle} (Large Fermeda); Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey (ascent in 1905 with Karl Blodig); Grossglockner, climbed at the age of 70! Compton died in Feldafing on 22 July 1921, aged 72. His son Edward Harrison Compton and daughter Dora Compton were also mountain painters. His other daughter Marion was a flower and still life painter. Art and influence Initially painting in the English romantic tradition, Compton later developed a more realistic representation of nature, being guided by his true artistic ideas while retaining topographical accuracy. Even his early watercolors show the great importance of brightness and light and his work is also remarkable for its portrayal of the elements such as water and air, including ascending mist and fog. He can be regarded as an impressionist. Although Compton never had much formal art education and did not found a school, he influenced artists such as Ernst Platz and Karl Arnold as well as his son Edward Harrison Compton and daughter Dora Compton.

He has more than 450 Hindi detective novels to his credit. Early life Sharma was born in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, as eldest son to Shiv Charan and Devi. He later moved to Delhi. He has two younger brothers namely, Jai Prakash Sharma and Gauri Shankar Sharma. He was employed with the Delhi Cloth Mill (DCM) and lived in a rented house in Pahari Dhiraj. Later settled in Meerut and having four sons namely Mahendra Sharma, Surendra Sharma, Virendra Sharma. Career A very thoughtful, erudite mind and a person of moral values, he worked for DCM and participated in trade union activities. Inspired from socialist and communist views, he joined the Indian Freedom Struggle and was jailed twice by the then British Raj for his involvement in the freedom movement. It was during this period that he started writing. His passion for writing developed from his obsession with reading. Several times in his creations, he has portrayed his rebellious attitude towards religious and social orthodoxy. An avid reader and an equally ardent writer, he wrote many short stories for small pocket book organizations as well as his own venture Delhi Pustak Sadan, with his friends and associates. Along with detective novels, he also wrote books of social relevance and historical inscriptions. His first popular novel was 'Saanjh Ka Sooraj' based on the 1857 Revolution in the period of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In a short span, the talent bore fruit. His novels had created a momentum in the contemporary readers. His readership crossed the boundaries and had admirers in other countries. Late in 1964, he shifted back to Meerut, his native place, to write in peace. He died on 14 October 1998 after prolonged illness. Writing style Sharma was wholeheartedly in awe of Sharat Chandra Chatterji's writings. Chatterji's writing style and the depiction of his characters had an immense impact on Sharma. Though, Om Prakash Sharma wrote populist detective novels, he had the acumen of writing good quality contemporary and historical literature as well as poetry. He had keen interest in Indian classical music. He was very fond of Nirguni bhajans hymns recital by Kumar Gandharva and many more Indian Classical Singers. What distinguished him was his manner of creating a suspense and interest in the script through actual incidents on one hand and imagination on the other, thereby creating a curiosity in the readers mind as to what shall happen next. The main characters of his writing include Rajesh, Jagat, Jayant, Jagan, Gopali, Bandook Singh, Chief Chakravarti, Bhuvan, Father William and many more. Rajesh was considered to be the human face of his writings, who many times on several occasions was preempted as the real time character. He authored some four or five novels featuring 'Bhootnath' as his tribute to the legendary Devaki Nandan Khatri. He also named his imaginary colony, official residence of personnel of 'Kendriya Khufia Vibhag' as 'Bhootnath Colony'. In his social attributions, he wrote against social oppression. In his historical inscriptions, 'Neeli Ghodi Ka Sawar', and 'Phir Aaya Toofan' were very popular. After writing for many publishing houses, he started to write for his own publication Janpriya Prakashan \\". . Many of his novels were huge hit at a time, when television as a medium of entertainment was not so common. Though, he received several offers to write for Hindi feature films, he denied, as he apprehended the material life and loved his slow peaceful but creative life. Many fake novels were also published in his name as 'Vikrant' being its main character. Adaptation Famous film producer Prakash Mehra's financer, Satyen Pal Chaudhary from Meerut, decided to make a film on his novel Dhadkan and invited him to Mumbai. He denied, but gave permission for the film since the film was being directed by Basu Chatterjee whom he highly admired. Chatterjee came to Meerut and narrated him the screenplay. The feature film Chameli Ki Shaadi with Anil Kapoor in the lead role was made based on his novel and is often broadcast on TV channels. Many more detective writers after his writing emerged like Surender Mohan Pathak, Ved Prakash Sharma, Ved Prakash Kamboj, etc. and to many of whom he was a friend, philosopher and guide. Throughout, his writings have served not only the purpose of entertainment but also of instructing, informing, or improving his readership by commenting on the current situation and offering a moral message for his readers.

It was broadcast on November 24, 2008. Chuck, Sarah and Casey are shocked to discover that Chuck's girlfriend Jill is a Fulcrum agent in search of the Intersect. In the wake of his disbelief, Chuck is asked to use his relationship with Jill to get to an agent called Leader. Plot In 2003 Chuck and Jill sit atop a Ferris wheel as Chuck tries to ask Jill out. Back in the present, Sarah and Casey worry about Chuck after finding out Jill is Fulcrum and that she has Chuck. Jill is in bed with Chuck at a hotel. When Jill leaves to take a shower Chuck flashes on her cell phone and realizes she's a Fulcrum agent. Back at Chuck's apartment, Chuck kisses Jill goodbye, pretending absolutely nothing is wrong. Inside his sister's house, Chuck feels sorry for himself, while General Beckman tells them the flash in Jill's room referenced an agent called Leader. Chuck must stay close to Jill to find him. Chuck and Jill go to a carnival where Jill tells Chuck she's Fulcrum and they run into Leader, who Jill betrays to protect Chuck. However, Leader escapes and Jill is captured. At the castle Casey and Sarah interrogate Jill with a lie detector and she gives them the location of a Fulcrum hospital currently treating Leader. Casey and Sarah go after him while Chuck talks to Jill about Stanford and Bryce. Sarah and Casey return to headquarters to find Chuck sitting at a desk, head in his hands. Jill emerges from behind the corner holding two guns. She makes them uncuff Leader and drop their weapons. Leader accesses the computer and begins searching for someone. Jill tells Chuck he is looking for Bryce Larkin, because they think he is the Intersect. Chuck is put in a glass cell opposite Sarah and Casey. Chuck uses the Castle manual to lock Leader and Jill out of the computer system, jam the communications, and summon the CIA. However, Leader attaches a mine to Sarah and Casey's door, demanding Chuck open the door or they die. Chuck opens the door and is taken out of Castle, but he sends a message to Sarah and Casey that he also unlocked their door and is leading them to Buy More. After Leader falls over one of Jeff's trip wires, Casey starts fighting him while Sarah looks for Jill. Leader defeats Casey but is knocked out by Big Mike, who came back from his fishing trip after being notified of a \\"security breach\\". Chuck leads Jill to one of the Nerd Herd vehicles, telling her to get away in it. But once she is inside, he puts the car in \\"detention mode,\\" automatically handcuffing her to the wheel. He admits he was going to let her get away, but when she was about to kill Sarah, he changed his mind. Outside Sarah tries to comfort Chuck before going inside, and when they do, Ellie, Jeff, Lester, Morgan and Awesome are waiting to celebrate Thanksgiving. = Buy More/Family = Ellie is furiously trying to clean the house in preparation for the arrival of Devon's parents. She also tells Morgan that he cannot come to dinner. Big Mike tells Jeff, Lester and Morgan (who have no Thanksgiving plans) that he needs them to guard the store because it will be full of product in preparation for Black Friday. On Thanksgiving Day, Morgan hatches a plan: He will venture outside the store to find a real turkey for Thanksgiving. Jeff hot wires the front door (they have all been locked inside by Big Mike) allowing Morgan to slip out. Unfortunately, the plan inadvertently sets off the silent alarm. Big Mike, relaxing on a fishing trip, looks down at his phone to see security breach flashing in red. At Ellie's place, Devon's parents are not coming to dinner after all. Ellie is so overjoyed that she does not get angry upon discovering Morgan digging through the trash for turkey scraps. She re-invites Morgan, who in turn invite Jeff and Lester. In the end, Ellie, Jeff, Lester, Morgan, Awesome, Sarah and Chuck celebrate Thanksgiving.

He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 2010 with the Detroit Tigers and won the American League Rookie of the Month Award the first two full months he was in the major leagues. He has also played in MLB for the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Angels, and Cincinnati Reds. High school career Boesch played high school baseball at Harvard-Westlake School in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. As a junior, Baseball America ranked him one of the top 25 prospects in the country. He won the World Wood Bat Championship as a member of Team Baseball America, was selected Best Hitter at the Area Code Games, Best Power Hitter at the Team One Nationals and won the Daily News Invitational Home Run Derby. In his senior year he batted .490 with seven home runs and was selected First Team All-CIF and a First Team High School All- American for the All-American Game. College career On the day University of California coaches came to scout him, Boesch swung at only three pitches ‚Äì all for home runs. Highly recruited by professional scouts and colleges, Boesch chose the University of California, Berkeley, where he hit the ball out of the park in his first college at bat. Boesch played three years of college baseball at Berkeley from 2004‚Äì06. He was awarded All-Pac-10 first team honors as a sophomore center fielder. He was the winner of the 2005 Clint Evans Award as the team's best hitter and co-winner of the team award for most valuable player. In 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves and the Brewster Whitecaps. Professional career =Minor Leagues= Boesch playing for West Michigan in 2007 Following his junior season, he was drafted in the third round of 2006 Major League Baseball Draft by the Detroit Tigers. Boesch began his minor league career in 2006 with the short season Oneonta Tigers, where he was a NY-Penn League All-Star. With the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps, in 2007, Boesch led all of Single A in RBIs and was third in hits. With the Double-A Erie SeaWolves, Boesch led the Eastern League in home runs (28) and won the MILB Round Trippers Award for leading all of AA in home runs, en route to his selection by Baseball America as Best Power Prospect AA. With the AA Seawolves, Boesch was named the Seawolves' Most Valuable Player, League Mid- Season All-Star, Post-Season All-Star, led the league in total bases and extra base hits. He finished fourth in runs scored and third in RBIs. Boesch also won a Gold Glove as he led the league with 15 outfield assists. Boesch was added to the Tigers 40-man roster and started the 2010 season with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. After winning Tigers Minor League Player of the Month in his first month in AAA, Boesch was called to the Major Leagues on April 23, 2010. =Detroit Tigers= 2010 Boesch as a rookie at Dodger Stadium The Tigers called up Boesch from the Toledo Mud Hens to replace the injured Carlos Guill√©n on April 23, 2010. Boesch made his major league debut the same day in a game against the Texas Rangers. Boesch hit a double off the left-field wall on the first pitch in his first major league at-bat. Boesch hit his first major league home run‚Äîa grand slam off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Joel Pi√±eiro‚Äîon April 30. Coming in the same inning as Scott Sizemore's first career home run, it was the first time two Tigers had hit their first career home runs in the same inning since Pop Dillon and Kid Elberfeld did it in 1901. Boesch was named the American League Rookie of the Month for May and June 2010 and Tigers Player of the Month in June. In his rookie season Boesch topped all American League rookies with 14 home runs and 67 RBIs. He finished fifth in the AL Rookie of the Year voting. 2011 After placing fifth in American League Rookie of the Year voting, Boesch's 2011 campaign began with him earning a starting position in the Tigers outfield. He started the season strong, leading the American League in June with 41 hits and a .380 batting average, but after establishing career bests with 75 runs scored, 121 hits, 16 home runs, and a .283 batting average, Boesch's season ended when he suffered a torn ligament in his hand in early August. It was the first time in his baseball career that Brennan had been sidelined by a serious injury. 2012 His 2011‚Äì12 off-season focused on a long post-surgery rehabilitation, and Boesch started the 2012 season slowly. He had his best month in July, when he hit .295, with 4 home runs and 17 RBIs. But after July, with his playing time reduced, Boesch completed his season with a .240 batting average, 12 home runs and 54 RBIs. Against the White Sox, in two key games during the pennant race, Boesch hit two game-winning home runs off Sox lefty Chris Sale, the only home runs Sale gave up all year to a left-handed batter. Eligible for arbitration after three years of MLB service, the Tigers, in January 2013, signed Boesch to a one-year, $2.3 million contract for the 2013 season, but the Tigers also signed free agent All-Star outfielder Torii Hunter. =New York Yankees= 2013 With Hunter lodged in right field, the Tigers released Boesch on March 13, 2013. The very next day the New York Yankees offered Boesch a Major League contract. In 23 games with the Yankees, Boesch hit .275 with 3 homeruns, and posted career highs with a slugging percentage of .529 and OPS of .831. On two different occasions, May 8 versus the Colorado Rockies and May 25 versus the Tampa Bay Rays Boesch delivered clutch game winning hits in the ninth inning. While Boesch was on a rehab assignment in AAA recovering from a slight muscle tear, the Yankees released him in order to make room on the roster to replace the injured All-Star shortstop Derek Jeter with another infielder. Boesch, a free agent going into the 2013 off season, played for the Escondigo Leones of the Dominican Republic Winter League where among other things he worked on sharpening his eye. Boesch was among league leaders in bases on balls and showed no ill effects from the injury that sidelined him. =Los Angeles Angels= 2014 On January 28, 2014, Boesch signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels. The contract included an invitation to spring training. On April 16, Boesch was called up and reached base on a fielding error on third baseman Josh Donaldson of the Oakland Athletics in his first plate appearance for the Angels. He was given a jersey with 00 number on it ‚Äì which he later called a distraction ‚Äì and switched to No. 28. The Angels designated Boesch for assignment on October 7, 2014. He elected free agency on October 9. =Cincinnati Reds= 2015 On November 26, 2014, Boesch signed a minor league deal with the Cincinnati Reds. He elected free agency on November 4, 2015. =Boston Red Sox= Boesch signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox in January 2016. He became a free agent after the season ended.

Origin Scott was the eldest son of Sir William Scott of Kirkurd, Younger of Buccleuch (died 1552), who was himself the son of Walter Scott, 3rd of Buccleuch (who was murdered on 4 October 1552, having been pre-deceased by his son). His mother was Grisel, second daughter of John Betoun of Creich.Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, volume II (David Douglas, Edinburgh, 1905), at pages 231-232 Career Scott succeeded his grandfather at age three. His uncle, Walter Scott of Goldielands, a natural half-brother of his father, led the Scotts during his minority. On 24 March 1566, Queen Mary appointed him captain of Newark Castle, Selkirkshire, whereupon he supported her with a force of over 3,000 men. In January 1570 (in reliance upon the distraction likely to be caused by the assassination of the Regent Moray, of which he had advance knowledge), he engaged in depredations on the English side of the Border. By way of retaliation the English, under the Earl of Sussex and Lord Scrope, destroyed his stronghold at Branxholme Castle. Scott rebuilt the castle in the following year. He was a principal leader of the raid to Stirling on 4 September 1571, when an attempt was made to seize the Regent Lennox, who was slain by one of the Hamiltons during the m√™l√©e. Buccleuch, who had interposed to save the Regent Morton, his kinsman, whom the Hamiltons intended also to have slain, was during the retreat taken prisoner by Morton, and was for some time confined in Doune Castle in Menteith. Scott died at Branxholme on 17 April 1574. Family Scott married Margaret Douglas, daughter of David Douglas, 7th Earl of Angus.

Biography Snellgrove was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and educated at Christ's Hospital near Horsham in West Sussex. He went on to study German and French at Southampton University. In 1941 he was called up to do his military service as a member of the Royal Engineers. He attended the Officers Cadet Training Unit in the Scottish seaside town of Dunbar, and was commissioned as an infantry officer. Thereafter he attended various intelligence courses and further training at the War Office in London, from where he requested a posting to India. Snellgrove arrived in Bombay in June 1943, and travelled cross-country to Calcutta. He was stationed at Barrackpore, some way up the Hooghly River. A few months after beginning his posting he contracted malaria and was sent to the military hospital at Lebong, just north of Darjeeling. It was while he was at Lebong that he began his future life's calling by purchasing some books about Tibet by Charles Bell as well as a Tibetan Grammar and Reader. Snellgrove returned to Darjeeling, from where he sometimes went on leave to Kalimpong. On one of these visits he took a young Tibetan into his personal employ in order to have someone with whom to practise speaking Tibetan. He also travelled in the small Himalayan state of Sikkim, and on one such visit he met Sir Basil Gould, who was then the British Representative for Tibet. Inspired to work in Tibet, in 1946 after he left the Army he sat the entrance exams for the Indian Civil Service. This was the first time the exams had been held since the start of the war, and the last time they were ever held. Although he passed the exams, he was not able to take up an appointment in India. Having already begun to study Tibetan, he resolved to find a university where he could further his studies. However, as no university offered courses in Tibetan at that time he was convinced by Sir Harold Bailey that a sound knowledge of Sanskrit and Pali would be beneficial, so he gained entry to Queens' College, Cambridge in October 1946. While at Cambridge, he converted to Roman Catholicism, in part through the influence of his friend Bede Griffiths. In 1950, after having completed his studies at Cambridge, he was invited to teach a course in elementary Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London. He was Professor of Tibetan at SOAS until his retirement in 1982. Snellgrove's research subsequent to his retirement was focused increasingly upon the art history of South East Asia. He died on 25 March 2016 in Pinerolo, Italy. Bibliography =Books and articles= *Snellgrove, David. (1956) Buddhist Morality. IN: Springs of Morality 239‚Äì257. *Snellgrove, David.

In the early years of rugby football the goal was to score goals, and a try had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to try at goal, and convert the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \\"score\\" a try, without scoring any points. = Change of Code = When Huddersfield converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on Tuesday 27 August 1895, Jack Dyson would have been 28.

APTN is dedicated to promote innovation and knowledge sharing amongst telecentres in the Asia-Pacific region where telecentres are growing exponentially each year. APTN is working towards creating a platform of networks of telecentres, to share experiences on issues of their interest (content, sustainability, connectivity, etc.) and to cooperate on the development of solutions for common problems of the telecentres themselves in order to empower poor and disadvantaged communities with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Asia Pacific Region.

Page 09 item 41 respectively. In view of the above, many countries established community access points with the intention of providing common access to ICT related services to rural communities. However, it has now been realized \\"Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network: Uniting for Development\\"; Telecentre Magazine December 2008 that community access points established to narrow the digital divide has not been able to capture the fragmented and underutilized knowledge of the poor and the disadvantaged communities. While many reasons could be attributed to this situation some of the significant causes are; inadequate exchange of experience related to ICT, weak linkages with stakeholders and low capacity of disadvantage communities in accessing and utilization of knowledge.

Networks through ICT Access Points for Disadvantaged Communities attempts to empower poor and the disadvantaged communities through transformation of selected ICT access points into knowledge hubs of global knowledge networks by providing, developing, organizing, sharing and disseminating knowledge demanded by these communities. In the process, the project anticipated achieving; establishment of global/ regional knowledge network(s) for community development, enriched value proposition of ICT access points through their transformation into knowledge hubs and increase engagement of poor and the disadvantaged in the transformation process. Since the inception of the project in 2006, number of activities has been accomplished to achieve the primary objective of the project. While the two regional meetings shared experience on telecentre operations and consulted telecentre operators on possible establishment of networks,Report of Consultative Meeting for the Establishment of Regional Knowledge Network of Telecentres in Asia-Pacific (27-28 September 2007), UNESCAP. (2007, December). ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMISSION FOR ASIA AND THE PACIFIC.

The Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network (APTN) was launched at the United Nations Conference Center in Bangkok on 19 November 2008, during an event attended by high level officials from 16 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, representatives from several United Nations bodies and other organisations.About APTN The Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network: a result of telecentre.org and UN Economic Commissions working together It was a collaborative initiative of UNESCAP together with 18 founding members from 10 countries in the region and support of partners such as the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and telecentre.org.  Secretariat  Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) had the privilege of hosting APTN Secretariat in Sri Lanka. Therefore, on 7 February 2009, APTN Secretariat was set up by Secretary to the President of Sri Lanka and Chairman of UN-ESCAP's Committee on Information and Communication Technology, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga.First National Nenasala Convention :: Sri Lanka: One Event, Multiple Outcomes While setting up the APTN Secretariat in Sri Lanka, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga gave an insight into the benefits of the Secretariat being hosted by Sri Lanka, :\\"I... being delighted that Sri Lanka has been selected to host the Secretariat of the Asia Pacific Telecentre Network and being aware that by hosting the Secretariat Sri Lanka can benefit as well as perform a pivotal role in making world community benefit from innovation and knowledge-sharing amongst telecentre organisations in the Asia- Pacific region...\\"  Objectives of the network  The APTN was set up with two main objectives. First it is intended to empower the poor and disadvantaged communities through the transformation of existing ICT access points in selected counties around the worlds into knowledge hubs of regional/ global knowledge networks. The second expected accomplishment is specifically concerned with transforming ICT access centres from conventional access centres into smart knowledge hubs. Transforming an ICT access point into a knowledge hub, involves revitalization of ICT access points, developing new functions, connecting them with the global networks, and activating partnerships. By becoming knowledge hubs, it is expected that the access centres will further have a positive impact on the development of local communities. Therefore, the APTN, which is established as a voluntary mechanism of networks of telecentres operating in countries in the Asia- Pacific region, has the objective to promote the interest of the telecentre movement throughout the region, and to strengthen the capacity of telecentres to provide, develop, organize, share and disseminate knowledge for the sustainable development of marginalized communities. Further, the network aims at synergizing the various initiatives being carried out by various institutions. There are several modalities which APTN would develop in its future endeavors such as, * Advocacy - providing a forum for identifying common issues and views, and promoting sustainable telecentres. * Training - sharing experiences, skills and expertise, identifying new or re-usable solutions for common problems, sharing researches on telecentre implementation - lessons learnt and best practices, and sharing knowledge on methodologies and tools used for telecentre assessment and evaluation. * Collective action - producing products collaboratively and pooling resources and creating synergies.  Role  The main intention of setting up APTN is to promote innovation and knowledge-sharing amongst telecentre organizations in the Asia- Pacific region where telecentres are growing each year. In achieving its target, the role of the APTN was modified and developed through several activities which were followed by its initiative taken place in November, 2008. During the regional workshop on Knowledge hubs in Asia Pacific Region, held in Nanjing, China on 8‚Äì10 September 2009, it discussed the benefits that APTN can provide to information and knowledge sharing, sustainability, best practices and resource mobilization for effective knowledge hubs/ networks.

It was agreed that national stakeholders would drive the process while the regional networks would add value through bringing best practices from different regions * Play a catalytic role in developing partnerships with countries which do not have national networks of telecentres * Develop criteria for membership of regional networks and also develop modalities for working relationships with national focal points.  Activities of the secretariat  Taking its first step to the APTN activities, APTN Secretariat has created a web portal (a-ptnetwork.ning.com) for the purpose of knowledge sharing among its member networks. Further, APTN has co-organized a workshop on resource mobilization for telecentre organizations in Asia-Pacific on 1 December 2009 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. \\"The Resource Mobilization Workshop for Telecentre Networks in Asia\\" Asian Telecentre Idol highlights IDRC-APTN Resource Mobilization Workshop was jointly organized by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the APTN. The workshop was successfully conducted, which was participated in by network leaders, telecentre knowledge workers and stakeholders from all over Asia. The whole day program consisted of three innovative segments which were organized and titled as 'Telecentre Idol Competition', 'Telecentre Open Clinic', and 'Telecentre Talk Show'.Telecentre Talkshow Participants of the Regional Workshop for Knowledge Hub in Asia Pacific Region: held in 8‚Äì10 September 2009, Nanjing, China.

APTN intends to play a vital role among the existing ICT access points/telecentres and networks as knowledge hubs to empower the poor and disadvantaged as these access points and networks provide knowledge or services to the needs of communities they serve. During the meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, it was reiterated that these access points or centres and networks were the direct means to reach marginalized and poor communities due to their proximity to the people and the areas that they serve. The Participants were of the view that easy access to these access points/ centres and affordable services, programmes specifically tailored to the poor and marginalized groups make them more effective and sustainable. Therefore, APTN is expecting to come up with special projects where it can address and empower the poor and marginalized societies with the benefits of ICT. Further APTN hopes to work with ICT access points/ networks which it can reach and bring opportunities for women to become entrepreneurs as well as catalysts for development and also the leadership role in the local community. In many countries in the Asia pacific region, women's associations had been using ICT access points/ networks as meeting places, training centres and tools to reach other women towards raising awareness in large spectrum of issues, such as, health, education, social issues, disaster preparedness, economic activities, among others. As recommended from a Bangkok, Thailand workshop, APTN will take steps to undertake the below mentioned activities with the intention of providing a better ICT services through the knowledge hubs and networks to empower the diverse communities in Asia Pacific region: * Establishing a telecentrepedia * To collaborate with the \\"telecenter.org\\" foundation and others to define its telecentre contents * Contribute ideas for the book of '100 ideas for sustainable telecentres' and proposed creation of \\"telecentre magazine\\" to be released by March 2010 in Manila, Philippines. * To work on 'Asia Pacific Telecentre Review' (APTR) * Publishing a 'telecentre best practices book'. * Using the available resources like, the telecentre academy, and material developed in countries like the Philippines for capacity building of telecentre operators and users * Working on on-line and off-line training and the need to localize training materials to suit country specific conditions and environment  See also  * Telecentre * Telecentre.org Academy of Sri Lanka * Asia-Pacific * United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  External links  * Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network * Network Locations Map * telecenter.org * United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific * ESCAP - Information and Communications Technology and Disaster Risk Reduction Division, Final Report - Regional Workshop for Knowledge hubs and Networks - Next Step, Bangkok (10-11 Dec 2009) * Telecentre Magazine * World Summit on the Information Society * World Summit on Sustainable Development * The Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network: a result of telecentre.org and UN Economic Commissions working together  References  Category:Community networks Category:Telecommuting ","title":"Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network"},{"id":"27076941","text":"Makl√°r is a municipality () in Heves county, in the Egri Subregion in Hungary.

Its research focuses on the exploration of the Sun and heliosphere. The institute has one solar telescope on the Schauinsland Mountain near Freiburg and, in collaboration with other institutions, uses solar telescopes of the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain. History The Institute was founded in 1943 as the 'Fraunhofer Institute' by Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer. Kiepenheuer was director of the Institute from 1943 until his death in 1975. The Institute was renamed as the 'Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics' to honour the founder of the Institute and to enable the Fraunhofer Society to call their own institutes (the first of which was founded in 1954), 'Fraunhofer Institutes'. Both Institutions had been named independently after the physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer, and they had no other connection besides the name. Outposts The solar observatory at the island of Capri, Italy was founded in 1954. The Coud√© refractor became operational in 1966, and from that time the solar telescope on the Schauinsland continued to be used only for testing equipment. For several years, the Capri observatory with its domeless telescope provided observation time to the institute. In the early 1970s, the Institute searched for a suitable place to establish a European solar observatory, and Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer took an active part in this search. Finally the Spanish island of Tenerife was chosen, due its dry weather and stable atmosphere. In 1989, the Vacuum Tower Telescope became operational, with a 70-cm mirror and adaptive optics. The outpost in Capri was closed after the solar observatory at the Teide Observatory became operational.

He claimed to be the descendant of Emperor Huizong of Song (1082‚Äì1135), the penultimate emperor of the Northern Song dynasty, and rebelled against the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Background of the rise to popularity The Yellow River flood of 1344 caused heavy casualties, displacement, hunger, epidemics, and the crisis in Dadu, the Yuan capital. The popular discontent with the ruling Mongol dynasty was triggered by the major construction project of the Yellow River rerouting 1351. Rebellion leader's career During the works, he claimed to have found a stone image with only one eye and a prophecy about the revolt inscribed on its back (Caomuzi). This was probably the reflection of some popular beliefs already widespread in Henan of the time. Han proclaimed the rebirth of Maitreya Buddha and the near coming of the \\"King of Light\\" (Â§©‰∏ãÂ§ß‰∫ÇÔºåÂΩåÂãí‰∏ãÁîüÔºåÊòéÁéãÂá∫‰∏ñ). Apparently, he used the title for himself (although there is no such historical record, after his death his son became known under the title \\"King of Light the Young\\", which provides the indirect evidence.) Han Shantong found a staunch supporter in Liu Futong (ÂäâÁ¶èÈÄö). After the plot was discovered, Han was executed. The son and legacy Han's son, Han Lin'er (ÈüìÊûóÂÖí) became the symbol of the following rebellion, of which Liu Futong became the leading general. Zhu Yuanzhang, the future founder of the Ming dynasty, was Han Lin'er's subordinate as late as 1363. Though Han and Liu's military power declined after 1359, Lin'er was probably seen as a legitimate future emperor. However, in 1366 or 1367, he accidentally drowned in a pond, not having achieved the rulership. There is a suspicion that the drowning was staged by Zhu Yuanzhang's agents, who by the time was already approaching the victory in his struggle for the Mandate of Heaven. (The story was reminiscent of Xiang Yu and the puppet Emperor Yi of Chu) Historical sources on the power transition predating foundation of the Ming dynasty were destroyed or heavily censored in order to hide the base origin of the founding emperor and his relation to the rebels. For this reason information on Han Shantong and other rebel leaders is very scarce. The single extant historical reference of Han Shantong's grandfather being a member of a \\"White Lotus gathering\\" developed into a stereotype that his teaching belonged to some clandestine tradition of long standing.

As part of the first ring of the fortifications of Metz, it is an early example of a S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system fort. While it did not see action during World War I, it was the scene of heavy fighting between American forces and German defenders at the end of the Battle of Metz, in 1944. After Second World War it became a training center for the French Air Force. Fort 'Alvensleben' has been abandoned since 1995. Construction and renovations Fort de Plappeville : Inspection by Himmler and officers, 7 September 1940 The Fort de Plappeville is part of the first ring of the Metz fortifications, built during the Second Empire by Napoleon III. The works began in 1867. It was designed by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, who oversaw the initial stages of the Metz fortifications. The fort was not complete in 1870 when war was declared between France and Germany. The defensive system would be completed and improved by German engineers between 1871 and 1898. The fort mounted about 100 guns and had a garrison of about 1600 men. Half-buried in a slope, the fort dominates the valley of the Moselle. Conceived to resist distant artillery fire, it also has a system of ditches evocative of the fortifications of Vauban. The fort resembles the contemporary Fort de Queuleu and the Fort de Saint-Julien, using a bastioned layout that would be quickly superseded in forts begun a few years later. The fort's barracks differ from those at Saint- Quentin and Queleu, and are located under the artillery platform of cavalier. Batteries on the Plappeville plateau, equipped with artillery turrets, complete the defense of the principal fort. Two of the most important armored batteries have four armored turrets with 150mm guns. A powder explosion in 1871 caused extensive damage to the barracks and required their reconstruction. Armored observation points were installed in 1885. = First World War = During the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany, the fort was renamed Feste Alvensleben and became a training camp for Prussian officers. From 1914 to 1918 it was used as a rest station for soldiers traveling along the front, particularly from Verdun. Its military equipment was upgraded to the standards current at the time. In November 1918, the fort was reoccupied by the French army. = Second World War = Fort de Plappeville : Review of the 1st SS Division by Himmler After the armistice of 1940 the fort was occupied by German forces. On 7 September Heinrich Himmler reviewed the troops of the 1st SS Division ( Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler) in the fort's place d'armes. The occasion was the presentation of a new standard to the SS formation, organized for the visit of the Reichsf√ºhrer to Metz at the request of General Sepp Dietrich.George H. Stein, The Waffen SS: Hitler's elite guard at war, 1939-1945, 1984 (p.28, n.7:' (RFSS/T-175, 90/2612641ff). The fort later became a disciplinary camp for the Wehrmacht. At the beginning of September 1944 the fort's defense was reorganized and integrated into the defense of Metz. Like the Fort du Mont Saint-Quentin, Fort Driant and Fort Jeanne d'Arc, the Fort de Plappeville first saw combat between September and November 1944 during the Battle of Metz. The Fort de Plappeville, placed under the command of Colonel Vogel of the artillery, as well as Fort du Mont Saint Quentin, commanded by Colonel von Stossel, provided mutual artillery support and impeded the American advance along the valley of the Moselle to the west of Metz. During the Battle of Metz the buried fortifications resisted American artillery attack well, particularly attacks with incendiary weapons. The forts fell after a series of violent assaults. Encircled by the 378th Regiment of the U.S. 95th Infantry Division, the Fort de Plappeville repelled a number of attacks. Colonel Vogel asked for a truce to evacuate his wounded, but refused to surrender. The Fort de Plappeville surrendered on 8 December 1944, with 200 men to the U.S. 5th Infantry Division, two weeks after the surrender of German troops in Metz. After the Second World War, in 1949, the fort was transferred to the French air force and became a military instruction center for new recruits at Metz-Frescaty Air Base. Abandoned since 1995, the fort has been vandalized.  Sources  * This article incorporates text translated from the corresponding French Wikipedia article as of April 23, 2010.

Background Shagari is the nephew of former President Shehu Shagari. He was born in the town of Shagari, Sokoto State in 1956. He attended Kanta College, Argungu until 1974, and the College of Arts and Science, now the University of Maiduguri (1974‚Äì1976). He attended Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1976‚Äì1979) and earned an LLB degree, and the Nigeria Law School (1979‚Äì1980), when he was called to the bar. After national service in Port Harcourt, Rivers State he worked briefly in the magistrate court, then served as state counsel to the Ministry of Justice, Sokoto State. He was then appointed as Sokoto State Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice. Shagari later set up a private legal practice. During the Nigerian Second Republic, he was legal adviser to the National Party of Nigeria in Sokoto State. He was a member of the Sokoto State branch of the National Republican Convention in the Nigerian Third Republic, disbanded in November 1993 when General Sani Abacha came to power. In the lead-up to the return of democracy in 1999, he was legal advisor to the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Sokoto State. Minister of Water Resources Shagari was appointed minister of Water Resources in June 2001. In December 2001, Shagari signed contracts for the N4.9 billion Hadeijah Valley Irrigation Project in Jigawa State and for the N468 million Egbe/Little Ose water supply project. In April 2002, Shagari became the President of the African Ministerial Council on Water. In the same month, Federal Government announced that 1,400 water projects across Nigeria had been revoked. Shagari said that the decision to revoke contracts was because several of the contracts were awarded to individuals, rather than to companies. In August 2002 Shagari spoke out against move to impeach President Obasanjo, supporting the President's record to date. In August 2003, the African Development Bank announced that it was cancelling 80% of its projects in Nigeria due to corruption and misuse of funds, but that the recipients were still liable to repay loans disbursed for these projects. Reacting, Shagari told Nigerian officials to put the interests of the people before their own interests. He said the government was now placing priority on small dams. The same month, Shagari gave the Ogun-Osun River Basin Authority the go-ahead to start rehabilitation of the Oyan dam. He also noted that the Abeokuta-Ota Water schemes would soon be completed. In October 2003 Shagari announced that the Federal Government had approved N10.7 billion for water projects across the country. He said the government had completed 2,500 water projects nationwide, but about 195 other water projects were still under construction. In February 2004, Shagari said that an N677 million contract awarded to a Korean company in May 2002 to build the Inkari Dam in Akwa Ibom State had been transferred to a Nigerian company. The Koreans, who moved to site in January 2003, had been deported. The N191 million contract for the Sabke Dam in Katsina State had also been transferred, and the project was near completion. In May 2005 Shagari said the Federal Government had spent over N180 billion on water supply from 1999 to the end of 2004, and water supply coverage had increased in this period from 35% to almost 65%. Shagari retained his ministry in a major cabinet shake-up in July 2005. In September 2005, Obasanjo wrote a commendation letter to Shagari in which he said minister had demonstrated humility, vision and patriotism in ensuring that communities across the country gained potable water. In October 2005 Shagari accepted a free-aid offer from China to help Nigeria to drill 598 boreholes in Abuja and 18 states. In January 2006, former Lagos State police commissioner Abubakar Tsav claimed that the authorities had embezzled N240 million given to Benue State to improve water supply in Makurdi. Shagari said the allegation was unfounded. In June 2006, Shagari said the government had surpassed the Millennium Development Goals target for water supply by about 10%. In a cabinet reshuffle on 10 January 2007, Shagari was released to run for Governor of Sokoto State in the April 2007 elections, and his ministry was merged into the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources under Adamu Bello. Deputy Governor of Sokoto State Shagari was nominated by the People's Democratic Party (PDP) as its gubernatorial candidate for Sokoto State in the 2007 elections. He polled 2,701 votes while the two other contestants polled 447 and 431 votes. However, after Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, who had been nominated as candidate for the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), crossed over to the PDP before the election, the PDP ruled that Shagari should run for Deputy Governor in partnership with Wamakko. In April 2008, the Court of Appeal in Kaduna nullified the election of Wamakko and Shagari on the basis of irregularities in the registration process due to the last-minute changes. After a re-run of the election, Wamakko and Shagari were reinstated in May 2008. In April 2010, there were reports that former President Olusegun Obasanjo was pushing to have Shagari appointed Vice-President to Acting President Goodluck Jonathan, who had taken over after the extended illness of President Umaru Yar'Adua. Other sources said that Shagari was Obasanjo's back-up choice after Adamu Bello of Adamawa State.

In 1770, West painted The Death of General Wolfe. This was not an accurate representation of the event, but rather an idealisation, and it included people who were not present at the event. Nevertheless, it became very popular, and West painted at least five copies. In 1801, three years after the Battle of the Nile, West met Horatio Nelson, who told him how much he admired the painting of Wolfe, and asked why he had not produced any more similar paintings. West, who was at the time the President of the Royal Academy, replied that he had found no subject of comparable notability. Nelson then expressed the desire that he would be the subject of West's next similar painting. In 1805, Nelson was killed in the Battle of Trafalgar and, within six months, West had created this painting. Again it proved to be popular. When West exhibited it in his studio, within just over a month it was seen by 30,000 members of the public. Again it was an idealisation of the subject. Although West took considerable trouble about the accuracy of details in his painting, basing the portraits on over 50 survivors of the battle, he produced, as he admitted himself, a picture \\"of what might have been, not of the circumstances as they happened\\". West created two more paintings with Nelson as the subject, The Death of Lord Nelson in the Cockpit of the Ship \\"Victory\\" and The Immortality of Nelson, both of which are in the National Maritime Museum. Other artists produced works depicting the same event. One of these was Arthur William Devis who painted The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805, now also in the National Maritime Museum. Another was The Death of Nelson by Daniel Maclise, a large wall painting in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster. The finished study for this work is owned by the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, having been bought by the gallery in 1892. West's painting is in oil on canvas and measures by .

In April 2010, Y≈çichi Masuzoe, a former Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare and member of the Liberal Democratic Party, defected from the LDP to join the Reform Club as president. He renamed the party the \\"New Renaissance Party.\\" Along with Your Party led by Yoshimi Watanabe, the NRP was viewed as a possible center-right counterweight to the LDP. However, four of its initial six Upper House members were voted out in the July 2010 election, leaving the party with only Masuzoe and Arai representing it in the Upper House. The NRP was ultimately overshadowed by Your Party as a reformist element. On August 3, 2012 the party in concert with six other minor opposition parties (People's Life First, Kizuna Party, Social Democratic Party, Your Party, New Party Nippon (which has no lower-house lawmaker) and the Japanese Communist Party) agreed to submit a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in an effort to block the passage of the bill raising Japan's consumption tax from 5% to 10%.

The ship is moored at the Mykolayiv Shipyard (former 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant). History The ship was laid down in 1983 and launched in 1990 just before the fall of the Soviet Union. Due to budget constraints work on the cruiser stopped in the early 1990s and the ship was left unfinished. In 1993 the cruiser was withdrawn from the Russian Navy and passed to Ukraine. In 1997 Ukraine stated that it had no need for the cruiser and was willing to sell it. Russia was unwilling to buy the cruiser, China and India were then approached but showed no interest at the time. In addition, the U.S. government has asked the Ukrainian government to stop supplying military technology to China in exchange for NATO accession and economic assistance. According to Ukrainian sources the Cruiser needs 30 million dollars to be finished. Status The cruiser sits docked and unfinished at the harbor of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. In April 2010, sources from the Russian defense committee claimed that Russia had plans to buy the unfinished cruiser from Ukraine and in May 2010, after talks with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in Kyiv, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych stated that they had come to an agreement to finish the ship together. On 21 January 2011, Russian navy sources stated that Russia was only interested in obtaining the cruiser if they can have it free of charge. By early March 2011, Russian defence minister Anatoly Serdiukov stated that Russia was still waiting for an acceptable offer from Ukraine, regarding potential procurement of the missile cruiser. His Ukrainian counterpart Mikhail Yezhel responded that he would not scrap a 95% complete warship, and that the issue would be resolved in the near future. It was reported that the Ukrainian government invested 6.08 million UAH into the ship's maintenance in 2012. On 26 March 2017, it was announced that the Ukrainian Government will be scrapping the vessel which has been laid up, incomplete, for nearly 30 years in Mykolaiv.

It is part of a complicated system of mountains in south-central Sichuan, and runs in the general north-south direction within Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and the adjacent parts of Ya'an prefecture-level city. Geography The Xiaoxiang Range is situated in the rugged mountainous regions of Southwestern China where the Hengduan Mountains abut the Yungui Plateau. Despite lying between the Dadu and Yalong Rivers, the Xiaoxiang are not considered part of the Daxue Mountains. The Xiaoxiang, and all mountains further south bounded by the Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River, are more commonly considered a northern extension of the Yungui. The Xiaoxiang Range is separated from the Daxue Mountains by a narrow fault trench through which the G5 Expressway runs. The Xiaoxiang are notable for their high ridge line, providing an unusually consistent straight range of peaks in the region. This is due to the Xiaoxiang's orogenic formation at the edge of the Yangtze Plate. The highest point of the range is Huatou Point (ÈìßÂ§¥Â∞ñ) at above sea level.E.g., ‰ΩøÁî®‰∏≠ÂõΩÂú∞ÂõæÈõÜ (Shiyong Zhongguo Dituji, \\"Practical Atlas of China\\"), 2008, ; map of Sichuan on pp. 142-143 The Xiaoxiang Range was heavily glaciated during the last glacial period leaving many cirques and tarns dotted along the ridgeline today. The Xiaoxiang Range is drained to west by the Anning River and its tributaries. The Anning separates the Xiaoxiang from the Miaoniu Mountains to the west. To the north and east, the Xiaoxiang is drained by tributaries of the Dadu River. Across the Dadu to the north lies the Daxiang Range. To the south and east are poorly-defined mountainous regions with no range-like features with the exception of the Daliang Mountains further east. Human activity The valleys surrounding the Xiaoxiang were originally inhabited by Yi peoples before Han Chinese settlement. The mountain summits have long been inaccessible and have been spared from the intensive agricultural uses that dominate many nearby mountainous areas. Thus, the lakes and forests along the Xiaoxiang ridgeline form a significant contiguous ecological habitat dominated by indigenous rhododendron species. This ecosystem has been classified by the WWF as part of the Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests and Yunnan Plateau subtropical evergreen forests ecoregions. Administratively, the Xiaoxiang Range falls within Mianning County to the west, Yuexi County and Ganluo County to the east, and Shimian County to the north. The Xiaoxiang Range rises above the primary route between Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, and Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. The Chengdu‚ÄìKunming Railway passes directly east of the Xiaoxiang and the new Beijing-Kunming Expressway passes directly to the west. Areas at the south end of the Xiaoxiang Range are currently being developed as a tourist zone.

This development software, widely used by OEMs and ECU suppliers of automotive industries is used to calibrate algorithms in ECUs at runtime.  Description  In calibrating ECUs, control behavior is modified for different vehicle models or variants. This is not done by making changes to the program code, but instead by changing the ECU‚Äôs parameterization. This involves the use of measurement and calibration systems such as CANape in the laboratory, on test benches or in vehicles during test trials. To evaluate the effects of changes to parameters, development engineers access the relevant process variables with conventional measurement technology at sensors and actuators and read out the data from the ECU. Measured data internal to the ECU, e.g. intermediate results of a computational function, can be accessed via ASAM standard protocols XCP or CCP and the ECU‚Äôs standard interfaces (CAN, FlexRay, LIN, Ethernet/BroadR-Reach). For a high-performance ECU access, data from microcontroller-specific interfaces (for example JTAG, DAP, AURORA) can be converted via an external hardware (like Vector‚Äôs VX1000 system) in XCP on Ethernet. A typical use case for calibration with CANape is online calibration. This involves modifying parameters directly in the ECU. The resulting control characteristic can be measured and checked directly. Using this approach, measured data from the ECU or physical measurement variables on or in the vehicle can be precisely analyzed to determine the effects of each individual change.  Features  Functions required to modify parameter values are implemented as standard features in CANape: Measuring, analyzing (manually or automated), calibrating, calibration data management, and flashing. CANape also enables symbolic access to data and functions accessible via the diagnostic protocol, and it supports calibration over XCP on FlexRay. Options extend the functional features of CANapeOptions for CANape by enabling access to models at runtime in Simulink, functional bypassing, optical verification of object detection algorithms in developing driver assistance systems (ADAS), and an ASAM MCD3 interface. CANape uses its own scripting language, hereinafter referred to as CASL (Calculation and Scripting Language). CASL, is a signal-oriented language. CANape contains a function editor for writing cross-device functions and scripts. The CASL scripting language used for this is similar to the C programming language.

The landfill is located at , southwest of Kettleman City on State Route 41 in the western San Joaquin Valley, Kings County, California. Environmental justice health issues have been an ongoing concern for the community and waste facility. The Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility is frequently criticized for its alleged health threats by the local organization 'People for Clean Air and Water' (El Pueblo para El Aire y Agua Limpio), and by environmental groups such as Greenaction. Waste Management, Inc. counters that it is a significant local employer, and donates funds to the local community, including Kettleman City Elementary School. The facility manager, Bob Henry, pointed out in a 2007 newspaper interview that it is periodically inspected by as many as nine federal, state, and local agencies. In 2007, Maricela Mares-Alatorre, a leader of 'People for Clean Air and Water,' was quoted as saying: \\"Are we supposed to be happy that they're getting more trash?

Historical overview of related environmental controversies =1975‚Äì1990= In June 1975 Kings County, CA issued a permit to McKay Trucking for the disposal of oil field wastes in the Kettleman Hills area. Subsequently, in 1979, the land was bought by Chemical Waste Management, Inc., a subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc. In 1982, Chemical Waste Management, Inc. received a permit for the processing of PCBs (known carcinogens), and soon after a Class I waste disposal permit that allowed for the processing of nearly any type of hazardous waste. At the time, the establishment of this facility and its repurposing to a full Class I hazardous waste disposal site went unnoticed by the residents of Kettleman City within 4 miles away from the facility. Community opposition and awareness of the facility emerged in the early 1980s; motivated in part by articles published in local newspapers about multimillion-dollar fines levied against Chemical Waste Management, Inc. for violating environmental laws. Because of its low average socioeconomic standing and 95% Latino population, Kettleman City and the nearby waste disposal site attracted the attention of the environmental justice movement. Advocates argued that Chemical Waste Management, Inc. and the local government were practicing environmental racism, pointing out that the nearest communities to all three major waste disposal sites in California were poor and almost entirely non-white. Environmental Justice groups also cited the 1984 Cerrell Report by the California Waste Management Board that suggested placing waste disposal sites and incinerators primarily in the communities that would be least able to resist. In 1988, a phone call from Greenpeace organizer Bradley Angel revealed to the Kettleman community that Chemical Waste Management, Inc. was planning to add a toxic waste incinerator to the disposal facility. Several residents attended a preliminary hearing on the incinerator and were concerned that a potential health risk would be placed so close to their town. This trial marked the beginning of a community-led grassroots environmental justice movement in Kettleman City, as well as the beginning of the ongoing conflict between the people of Kettleman City and Chemical Waste Management, Inc. In 1989, more than 200 residents from Kettleman City showed up to testify at the Kings County Planning Commission hearing on the incinerator project. When the incinerator project was approved, the residents of Kettleman City filed a lawsuit against Chemical Waste Management, Inc., alleging that their environmental impact report did not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act. A trial court ruled that Chemical Waste Management, Inc. had not sufficiently analyzed the environmental and health impacts of the incinerator, and had failed to provide a full Spanish version of their impacts report, preventing participation from Kettleman City residents. The company appealed the court's decision, but dropped the plans for the incinerator before an appeal decision had been reached. =1990‚Äì2009= Following the controversy over the incinerator, the waste disposal site continued to operate and reached its economic peak of operation during the early 1990s. Although the people of Kettleman City continued to protest against Chemical Waste Management, there were no major environmental justice battles in Kettleman City during these years, apart from the continued criticism of activists that the location of hazardous waste exhibited structural racism. The 1990s also saw the Kettleman Hills facility facing regular scrutiny and fines from the EPA and the TSCA enforcement committee. The EPA reports that the facility committed environmental violations every year between 1990 and 1995, as well as in 1998. In 2004, a TSCA compliance inspection of the Kettleman Hills Facility reached the conclusion that there had been no monitoring of certain PCBs since 1995, and that the failure to dispose of PCBs within the legal time limit had gone unreported on two occasions. That same report concluded that from 2002-2003 there were 16 spills of hazardous waste, and six instances of waste being stored in unsealed containers. The facility also underwent numerous permit expansions under Class I and Class III waste disposal during the mid to late 2000s, many of which were accompanied by public hearings that were well represented by Kettleman City community leaders. =2009‚Äì2012= The year 2009 marked the resurgence of the environmental justice movement in Kettleman City, as well as the renewal of the conflict between the people of Kettleman City and Chemical Waste Management, Inc. The environmental justice advocacy group Greenaction released a statement alleging a possible correlation between the recent high number of birth defects in the region, with 14 cases in 2007-2008, five of which were cleft lip and/or palate, and the presence of the waste disposal facility.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/us/07kettleman.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0LA TIMES: Kettleman City asks: Why so many birth defects? Some residents of the impoverished town wonder if a nearby hazardous waste facility is to blame.  greenaction.org The residents of Kettleman City voiced opposition to Chemical Waste Management, Inc.'s facility with a community-led movement.Kettleman City reaps toxic harvest of Calif. castoffs  Toxic Land  FresnoBee.com The Kings County's Public Health Officer was skeptical, stating that he understood the community's concern, but believed the birth defects were a \\"statistical anomaly\\". However, the state promised to conduct a wide range investigation into the high number of birth defects as well as into the water quality and the frequency of asthma and cancer. Not long after the birth defects controversy began, Chemical Waste Management, Inc. applied for a permit to expand the facility, and was met with heavy resistance from the Kettleman City community during the 60-day comment period.https://dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Projects/upload/Kettleman_PN_Permit- Mod_CommentPeriodExt_1013.pdf The Cal EPA granted them the permit to expand, pending the findings of the birth defects investigation, on December 21, 2009. The initial findings of the Cal EPA and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) were released in community meetings in early 2010. The report found that the birth defect rate was inconclusive due to a small sample size and no significant sources of environmental exposure were found in the city. However, the pesticides found in homes warranted further investigation. On January 20, soon after the initial findings had been released, Greenaction filed a lawsuit against the Kings County Board of Supervisors. Greenaction alleged that in light of the inconclusive and possibly flawed birth defect report, the approval of Chemical Waste Management, Inc.'s expansion permit violated the CEQA and state civil rights laws.http://greenaction.cclearn.org/incinerators/kettleman/documents/PressReleaseKettlemanCityLawsuitFiledJan202010.pdf That same week, California Senator Barbara Boxer issued a statement saying that \\"the Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility should not be expanded until there is more conclusive results on the potential health impacts on the local community.\\" Within a week of the lawsuit, Governor Schwarzenegger ordered the Cal EPA and the CDPH to launch a full investigation into the correlation between the disposal facility and the health issues experienced by the residents of Kettleman City. The full 160-page report was released on November 22, 2010, and found that none of the possible exposures to hazardous materials could be correlated to an increase in birth defects. The report's recommendations were to continue to pursue a safer source of drinking water for Kettleman City, as well as to continue investigation into the effects of the trace presence of contaminants. A further update was released in 2011 stating that the level of birth defects in Kettleman City had dropped below their 2008 levels. During the birth defects controversy, Chemical Waste Management, Inc. was fined $402,000 on November 29, 2011 for violating the TSCA. The investigation concluded that they had been using improper disposal techniques for carcinogenic PCBs and other hazardous material wastes without treatment.https://dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Projects/upload/CWMKettlemanHillsFacilityInspectionEnforcementHistory.pdf Waste Management, Inc. was further ordered to set aside $600,000 for the purpose of physical and operational improvements to the facility. =2013‚Äìpresent= On July 2, 2013, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control‚ÄîDTSC released a draft decision on a permit modification that would allow Waste Management, Inc. to increase the capacity of the hazardous waste landfill. This modification would add about 14 landfill acres and increases the capacity by 50 percent, or approximately 5 million cubic yards. The effect of this expansion would add an estimated 4.6 billion pounds of toxic waste to the site.Ecowatch Blog: \\"Assemblyman Alejo Opposes Expanding Toxic Waste Disposal in Kettleman Hills\\". accessed 12.31.2013 On May 21, 2014, the DTSC issued a final permit approving the company's planned expansion to allow an additional 5.2 million metric tons of capacity.http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PressRoom/upload/News_Release_T-11-14.pdf accessed May 22, 2014 http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/05/21/3936946/state- approves-controversial-kettleman.html?sp=/99/406/263/ http://www.hanfordsentinel.com/news/local/full-story-kettleman-hazmat- expansion-gets-ok-from-state/article_3c6019b0-e146-11e3-97c6-0019bb2963f4.html Appeals of the permit issuance were filed by Greenaction together with People for Clean Air and Water of Kettleman City and by the Center for Race, Poverty and the Environment.

Relevant legislation The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) was enacted in 1976 to govern the disposal of solid and hazardous waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the goals of the RCRA are to focus on protecting human health and the environment from waste disposal as well as conserving natural resources and reducing waste generation. The ‚Äúcradle to grave‚Äù provision of Subtitle C established a management program which required a strict permitting and control process for the creation and disposal of hazardous waste. Under this program, treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs) must meet specific criteria in order to be permitted or be allowed interim status to continue operating while un- permitted. The Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility is governed under the RCRA and thus is subject to these permitting requirements. As a result, the Kettleman Hills Facility has been required to request a modification of their current permit by the California Department of Toxic Substance Control in order to expand the facility by the requested 14 acres to make room for the disposal of more waste. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), passed in 1976 worked to regulate the sale and use of chemicals in the U.S, but its primary focus was on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Its effects on the Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility is similar to the RCRA by requiring permitting by the EPA in order to make the requested 14 acre expansion into a site which allows for the dumping of PCBs. During this permitting process, the TSCA PCB permit application requires the EPA to issue a public notice once a decision has been reached, as well as hold a 60-day formal comment period for the public, as well as a formal public hearing. In February 1994, Executive Order 12898 was implemented which addressed issues of minority and low-income groups bearing the burden of disproportionate negative environmental and health effects. It states that ‚Äúeach Federal Agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low income populations.‚Äù It also set forth a series of steps for assisting and aiding federal organizations in addressing environmental injustice. Requirements of the executive order, such as translating documents into the native language of a community have been key issues for groups such as Greenaction in the dispute with the Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility. Risk factors for environmental injustices Kettleman City Protest Issues of environmental justice are pertinent to the largely minority population Kettleman City community as studies show that blacks and respondents at lower educational levels, and to a lesser degree, lower income levels were significantly more likely to live within a mile of a polluting facility.Mohai, P., Lantz, P., Morenoff, J., House, J., and Richard P. Mero. (2009). Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in residential Proximity to Polluting Industrial Facilities: Evidence From the Americans‚Äô Changing Lives Study. American Journal of Public Health, 99. Greenaction, a San Francisco-based environmental justice organization, has been working with the local community to document the cases of infant deaths and believes there are issues of environmental injustice due to the city's demographics. Within Kettleman City's population that is 25 years or older, only 30% have completed high school or its equivalent, and 56.4% have less than a 9th grade education. The majority of residents are from Mexico and are Spanish-speaking. In the 2000 Census, the median household income was $22,409 and 43.7% of the population was living below the poverty level. Compared to the US population, Kettleman City residents are younger, and are more likely to rent rather than own their homes. Environmental justice is principally concerned with people's and communities‚Äô entitlement to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations.Mohai, P., Pellow, D., and J. Timmons Roberts. (2009). Environmental Justice. Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 34, 405-30. There are three separate perspectives on why environmental injustices exist: economic, sociopolitical, and racial. However, the three categories are not mutually exclusive, considering that, for example, economic motives may coincide with sociopolitical factors. Economic explanations argue that the industry is not intentionally discriminating against racial, ethnic, or poor minority groups. The industry is only trying to maximize profits and siting a new facility in areas where the land is cheap serves to maximize profits. Industrial labor pools and manufacturing materials tend to be cheaper in this aspect as well. The racial and socioeconomic composition of a community may subsequently change with the addition of a waste facility. The ensuing negative health and environmental impacts result in a flight of affluent residents to more desirable neighborhoods, subsequently driving land values even lower. Thus, the depression of property values results in an influx of poor and people of color as housing becomes more affordable. Sociopolitical explanations argue that industry and government seek the path of least resistance when siting new hazardous waste facilities. In an effort to avoid controversy, sites are located in areas where communities are least capable of mounting an opposition. More plainly, facilities are located in areas where communities are not capable to politicize and oppose the new factory. Further, communities without a high degree of pre-existing social capital as well as low levels of voting behavior, home ownership, wealth, and disposable income are more vulnerable to high concentrations of polluting facilities than other communities. Racial discrimination explanations illustrate that although present-day siting decisions may be based on a rational desire to place new facilities in areas that have been zoned industrial, these wind up disproportionately in communities composed primarily of people of color because of past discriminatory decisions about where to line industrial zones. Current decisions that may seem facially neutral may have discriminatory outcomes because of past discriminatory actions Environmental impacts In 2008 Waste Management applied to expand their landfill for the purpose of storing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an investigation of a variety of invertebrates, fish, reptiles, mammals, and plants were in order to determine an environmental impact, if any. The EPA's July 2009 report followed that two species may be affected by the expansion: the San Joaquin kit fox and the blunt-nosed leopard lizard. Furthermore, in 1984, Waste Management discovered groundwater contamination underneath two formerly unlined ponds. Pond P-09 was lined in 1985 and cleanup began in 1988. Pond P-12 stopped receiving waste in 1985 and was closed in 1997. Groundwater cleanup began in 1985. Waste Management has 48 monitoring wells in the surrounding and impacted areas as of December 2012. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) ordered the facility to clean up spills of PCBs around the storage building, and as of February 2012, DTSC reported that the soil cleanup and removal was the final step in protecting human health and the environment as there was no longer a threat. Under the direction of the Kings County Planning Agency, in March 2008 CH2M Hill, an independent engineering and consulting firm, prepared an impact report aimed to identify and evaluate potentially significant adverse environmental impacts associated with the proposed expansion of the Kettleman Hills Facility. *Aesthetics **The areas of the Kettleman Hills Facility that would be affected by the expansion project will not be visible from Kettleman City, therefore there are no significant aesthetic impacts. *Air Quality **It will not exceed federal and state standards for nitrogen oxides, reactive organic gases, sulfide dioxides, carbon dioxide or atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less at the facility's boundary **The project will exceed the federal and state standard for PM10 at the facility's boundary. The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin is a designated non-attainment area, that is that the air quality in that region is worse than NAAQS standards, for the federal and state ozone 1 and 8-hour standards, and for both the federal and state PM10 and PM2.5 standard, the project is found to have both project-specific and cumulative significant impacts on air quality. *Biological Resources **103 acres of land are located outside of the existing facility's area **Four protected and sensitive wildlife species have the potential to occur within the proposed project's area **Due to the project's construction in undisturbed areas, the project is found to not have a significant impact to protected or sensitive wildlife species *Culture and Paleontology **The project area does not contain potentially significant archaeological resources **Paleontological studies report that the probability of fossil occurrence in the proposed area appears to be moderate to high **The probability of impact on paleontological resources is also moderate to high *Additional Impacts **There will be a continuation of the same waste transport and disposal activities **No additional impact to Kettleman City Elementary School, the nearest school located about 3.5 miles from the current facility *Groundwater **Project found to be designed to meet state and federal requirements to assure that impacts will not occur to groundwater or surface water **No significant impact to groundwater or surface water resources *Ambient Noise **The maximum onside noise levels for the proposed project would remain below the Kings County noise standard of 70 decibels (dB) for agricultural lands *Climate Impact **Carbon dioxide emissions associated with the expansion project are not new emissions ***The proposed projects will continue the maximum average of vehicle trips to and from the facility, so the emissions are not new emissions, but a continuation of the facility's already scheduled transportation trips **Transportation emissions would not result in a net increase in global greenhouse gas emissions **Any substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions are considered significant in relation to their impact on climate change **The total incremental estimated carbon dioxide emissions by the expansion facility contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and is considered a significant contribution to the cumulative assessment of global climate change On January 29, 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger directed the Cal/EPA and California Department of Public Health(CDPH) to assess the potential for a relationship between environmental contaminants and health defects. This was spurred by community concerns regarding a recent outbreak of birth defects. The Chemical Waste Management Kettleman Hills facility was found to not be the single direct causal factor in the recent birth defects.The Cal/EPA tested the air, soil, and water at agricultural operations, the Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility, the Kettleman City Elementary School, and possible illegal dump sites for 27 pesticides, air pollutants, arsenic, lead, soil and soil gas contaminants. The Cal/EPA found higher than normal levels of arsenic in tap and well water, low levels of lead in town and school wells, benzene in air near treatment unit that removes chemical from well water, one home yard that had high levels of a banned pesticide. Potential health effects The community of Kettleman City has suspected negative health effects caused by the Waste Facility multiple times. In 2007, the surrounding community in Kettleman City voiced their concerns regarding potential health effects in response to Chemical Waste Management's application for a federal permit renewal in the same year. The permit was to allow the facility to continue storing and disposing PCB waste at the facility. The EPA responded by ordering the facility to conduct a PCB Congener study. The facility collected soil, vegetation, and air samples at the perimeter of the CWM Facility to be tested in a State-certified laboratory. The findings concluded that concentrations of PCB congeners measured in soil samples are 2,000 times below the EPA's risk-based levels residential clean-up levels. The risk of health impacts from soil, vegetation, and air were within an acceptable range as with other rural areas without any known PCB activity. Concentrations of PCB congeners measured in soils, vegetation and air do not adversely affect ecological species, and there is no evidence that PCB congeners would migrate off-site at concentrations that would adversely affect the neighboring environment and communities. In 2009, the community suspected birth defects caused by the waste facility. However, CDPH has not determined Kettleman Waste Facility to be the cause of health effects. The Kings County Department of Public Health stated that it would continue its investigation but that their preliminary determination was \\"that to the extent that a cluster may exist, it is most likely a random event unrelated to any environmental exposure unique to Kettleman City.\\"Yamashita, Eiji. \\"Kings County responds to birth defects concerns\\", The Sentinel, Hanford, CA, 17 July 2009. Retrieved on 11 April 2014. Even though ‚Äúscientifically rigorous studies of causes of human birth defects generally require evaluation of hundreds of birth defects or more\\", the CDPH's objectives were limited and largely focused on evaluating risk factors because of the fewer than dozen cases of birth defects in Kettleman City. The CDPH investigated a total of 11 eligible children born with major, structural birth defects between 2007 and March 31, 2010 to mothers who had lived in the Kettleman City area during their pregnancies. Through a mixed-methods approach consisting of interviews and supplementary medical history reports the CDPH did not find a specific cause or environmental exposure among the mother that would explain the increase in the number of children born with birth defects. It was found that some children had multiple abnormalities, while others had single defects. All the birth defects represented different underlying conditions, but a few shared some features. None of the mothers interviewed during the investigation used tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs that could cause the birth defects. Furthermore, the mothers were all in good health and did not have suspect medical histories. The conclusions of the investigation have been contended by Greenaction and the local community group \\"El Pueblo para El Aire y Agua Limpoio\\" (\\"People for Clean Air and water\\"). Bradley Angel of Greenaction in Kettleman City argues that the investigation was not thorough enough, neglecting to test blood and tissue samples of those affected. He also notes that the investigation did not adequately test for pesticides inside homes. The reported defects were also evident in areas around California and elsewhere. The findings concluded that, coupled with the lack of any shared unusual exposures, the birth defects were not caused by a common factor. A California Department of Public Health (CDPH) update for 2009-2011 concluded that the rates of birth defects in Kettleman City in 2010 and 2011 appear to be returning to the lower rates seen prior to 2008. CDPH reviewed the Birth Defects Registry data from Kettleman City and still did not find a common cause for the birth defects. Financial implications The issue in Kettleman City has resulted in much discussion over the financial implications for the county, city, and company. The Kettleman Hills Hazardous Waste Facility initially requested the expansion due to the near filling of their 10.7 million-cubic-yard site. Lily Quiroa, a spokeswoman for Waste Management, Inc. has stated that as a result of the denial of expansion, ‚Äúwe have laid off more than two-thirds of our employees. There has been a big impact on our business here, and it has had an impact in the economy in this county.\\" In 2012, it was reported that the company paid approximately $312,000 in fines as a result of not reporting waste spills that had occurred.Grossi, Mark. \\"Kettleman City toxic landfill fight might turn on finances\\" , The Fresno Bee, Fresno, CA, 20 July 2013. Retrieved on 09 April 2014.

For example, 20 is a primitive abundant number because: :#The sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22, so 20 is an abundant number. :#The sums of the proper divisors of 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10 are 0, 1, 3, 1 and 8 respectively, so each of these numbers is a deficient number. The first few primitive abundant numbers are: :20, 70, 88, 104, 272, 304, 368, 464, 550, 572 ... The smallest odd primitive abundant number is 945.

Although sometimes considered a full species (Pyrrhula cineracea), most authorities treat it a subspecies of the Eurasian bullfinch.Avibase.bsc- eoc.orgTaxonomicon.taxonomy It migrates altitudinally from its summer breeding range in the Altai Mountains to its winter range in the adjacent foothills and plains. Description The male differs from that of the nominate subspecies by having completely grey underparts. Taxonomy The subspecies was described in 2001 by Arnaiz-Villena et al. All birds belonging to the genus Pyrrhula have a common ancestor: the pine grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator). Distribution and habitat In Russia In Kazakhstan the Baikal bullfinch is a rare resident and common winter visitor. It breeds in the western Altai Mountains, including the Belaya Uba valley, and the Sayan Mountains (eastern Altai) of western Mongolia; in the southern Altai it breeds in the upper reaches of the Bukhtarma River, around Lake Markakol, and in the Kara-Kaba valley (where it intergrades with the nominate subspecies). On post-breeding dispersal and in winter, it occurs mainly in the foothills and plains of eastern Kazakhstan, sometimes as far west as Semipalatinsk, Kurgaldzhino Reserve and Astana, Almaty, the Chu-Iliyskiye Mountains and at Kyzylorda in the Syr Darya valley. The Baikal bullfinch inhabits fir forests with some deciduous trees, fir-larch and spruce-birch forest in river valleys and lake shores at altitudes of 1,400‚Äì1,800 m. On dispersal, the Baikal bullfinches visit deciduous forests with a shrubby understorey, riparian forests and thickets of tall weeds. Behaviour =Breeding= The birds breed in the Altai from May, with scattered pairs nesting some distance from one another. A nest recorded in early May in a birch tree was built 5 m above the ground of thin twigs and dry grass lined with thin rootlets and hair. Fledglings and independent juvenile birds have been recorded from mid-July to early August. Dispersal from the breeding range begins in August and September, with birds appearing in southeastern Kazakhstan from the end of October to early November, and remaining there until mid-May.

Serving with the Royal Air Force (RAF), he was credited with sixteen aerial victories before being killed in action during the Battle of France. In a combat career lasting a matter of months, he was Australia's first ace of the war. Born in South Australia, Clisby joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a mechanic in 1935, but was later accepted for flying training. He graduated as a pilot in 1937, and chose to take a commission with the RAF. After arriving in Britain, he was assigned to No. 1 Squadron, flying the recently introduced Hawker Hurricane. Posted to France following the outbreak of World War II, he achieved his first aerial victory on 1 April 1940. Clisby became known as a highly aggressive fighter pilot, who threw himself into combat irrespective of the odds. In a five-day period, commencing on 10 May 1940, he was credited with destroying at least eight German aircraft. Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for these and earlier victories, he was himself shot down in flames on 15 May. He was buried in France. Early career Clisby (far left) and fellow RAAF pilots in alt=Thirteen men in dark military uniforms standing outside a building Born in McLaren Vale, South Australia, on 29 June 1914, Clisby was the second of four children to carpenter Albert Clisby and his wife Mabel, n√©e Chapman. While attending Nailsworth Junior Technical School, Les also studied engineering in evening classes at the South Australian School of Mines and Industries in Adelaide. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a mechanic in 1935, but was later accepted into the flying training course at Point Cook, Victoria. On 24 April 1936, Clisby was flying in formation when he encountered problems and bailed out; a subsequent inquiry found that the plane's loss was due to his lack of experience. He nevertheless graduated in 1937 and, under a pre-war arrangement between the British and Australian governments, volunteered for transfer to the Royal Air Force (RAF); he sailed for Europe that July.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 84‚Äì85Bishop, Fighter Boys, pp. 163‚Äì164 On 26 August, he was granted a five-year short-service commission as a pilot officer, and assigned to No. 1 Squadron at RAF Tangmere in Sussex. The unit operated the new Hawker Hurricane, a monoplane with a top speed of over and four machine guns in each wing.Bridgman, Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II, pp. 128‚Äì129 In amongst training and an active social life, Clisby wrote to his family of a young lady back home in Adelaide becoming his fianc√©e. World War II By the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, Clisby was a flying officer. Five days later, No. 1 Squadron deployed to Le Havre in northern France with the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force that accompanied the British Expeditionary Force.Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, pp. 124‚Äì125 Through the autumn and winter of 1939‚Äì40, amidst the so- called Phoney War, a succession of small and indecisive clashes took place between the Allied air forces and the Luftwaffe. Clisby achieved his first aerial victory on 1 April 1940, a Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin-engined fighter over Moselle. The following day in the same vicinity, he claimed a Messerschmitt Bf 109.Newton, Australian Air Aces, pp. 77‚Äì78Holmes, Hurricane Aces, pp. 32‚Äì34 As the Battle of France opened on 10 May, Clisby began to score heavily, estimates for his remarkable run of \\"kills\\" in the next five days ranging from eight to thirteen or more.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 20 alt=Thirteen men in dark military uniforms standing outside a building Clisby destroyed two Dornier Do 17 bombers on 10 May, after which his aircraft was struck by friendly fire from a French anti-aircraft battery. He became an ace the following day, when he shot down three German fighters before the rudder of his Hurricane was damaged by enemy gunfire. Breaking off combat, he found a Heinkel He 111 bomber drifting in front of him and instinctively took a shot at it, forcing it to land in a paddock. Clisby himself landed nearby and, when they tried to escape, chased the German crewmen across the field, firing his revolver. Capturing one in a rugby tackle, he forced the others to surrender at gunpoint. He then proceeded to march them over to French authorities before rejoining his squadron, whose diarist recorded: \\"He wanted their autographs!\\" According to Time magazine, reporting on the exploit some weeks later, \\"Clisby's commanding officer remarked it was a bit uncommon for pilots to bring back prisoners\\". By now Clisby had become known for his extreme aggression in the air, rushing headlong into combat irrespective of the odds and often alone. On 12 May, he was credited with the destruction of six aircraft, claiming three Bf 109s and three Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance planes (also identified as Arados) during action in support of Fairey Battles in their historic raid on the Albert Canal bridges near Maastricht, on the Dutch-Belgian border.Holmes, Hurricane Aces, pp. 37‚Äì39 For his achievements that day, as well as his earlier successes, Clisby was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). The citation would be promulgated in the London Gazette on 14 June: alt=Single-engined military monoplane being refuelled by truck on airfield Described as being \\"extrovert, profane, perpetually cheerful and addicted to flying\\", Clisby also had \\"premature lines\\" on his face. At twenty-five, and with only a few months of air-to-air combat experience, he was considered a seasoned campaigner and had become No. 1 Squadron's top-scoring ace. He was also the first Australian-born ace of the war,Mordike, The RAAF in Europe and North Africa, pp. 95‚Äì96 and was well known for giving vent to patriotic feelings for his homeland in another way. All RAAF personnel who served with the RAF were permitted to continue wearing their original dark-blue Australian uniform until it wore out, after which they were to exchange it for the lighter-coloured British variety. Clisby flatly refused to give up his RAAF uniform, regardless of how shabby it became. When teased about its condition, he would simply respond, \\"It will see me through\\". Clisby was still wearing his RAAF uniform on 15 May when he went into action with his flight against more than thirty Bf 110s over Reims. Having destroyed two of the German heavy fighters, Clisby's Hurricane was seen going down with its cockpit trailing smoke and flames, evidently hit by cannon fire. He was initially posted as \\"missing\\", along with one of his comrades, Flying Officer Lorimer, whose plane was also seen losing height in the same action. The French later found two burnt-out Hurricanes in the vicinity of Rethel, which were identified as Clisby's and Lorimer's. Clisby died without knowing that he had been awarded the DFC. A fellow pilot later said, \\"He was an Australian and had thrown himself into the fray with a reckless abandon that was magnificent in its way\\". Estimates of Clisby's total number of victories in his short career range from nine to twenty or more, but the most common‚Äîand official‚Äîscore attributed to him is sixteen. The loss of much of the RAF's documentation in the chaotic retreat through France and across the English Channel in May 1940 meant that many squadron records and combat claims had to be reconstructed from the memory of surviving personnel. Even the date of Clisby's death is unclear, some sources (including the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) claiming 14 May rather than the following day. Regardless of the exact date, he was the first RAF ace of the war to be lost in action. Clisby was buried in the military cemetery at Choloy in north-eastern France. His name appears on Supplementary Panel 12 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

Boisture Jr. (February 22, 1925 ‚Äì May 18, 2007)Date of birth is from the Social Security death index. was an American football coach. He was the head coach of the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team from 1967 to 1973, compiling a record of 45‚Äì20‚Äì3. Boisture was a star athlete in high school, playing both basketball and football at Detroit Holy Redeemer. He served in the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater during World War II, and was wounded in the Battle of Okinawa, for which he was awarded a Purple Heart. After returning home, he was recruited as a basketball player by Notre Dame, but instead attended the University of Detroit, where he lettered four times in football as an end, and twice in basketball. In 1949, Boisture helped the University of Detroit football team win the Missouri Valley Conference championship in the school's first year in the conference. Boisture began his coaching career as a high school football coach at Dearborn St. Alphonsus High School and Ecorse St. Francis Xavier High School. From 1954 through 1958, he coached at Detroit St. Mary's of Redford High School in the Detroit Catholic League, where his teams accumulated a 37‚Äì4‚Äì2 record and won the Catholic League championship four of the five years he coached there. In 1959, at the age of 33, he became an assistant coach at Michigan State University, under Duffy Daugherty, where he stayed through the 1966 season. During his time at Michigan State, the team won two national championships, in 1965 and 1966. In July 1967, Boisture was hired as head coach at Eastern Michigan University. He later commented that he was willing to go to a smaller school, saying, \\"There weren't many jobs open...Joan and I looked at the campus. It was a cute campus.\\" Under his leadership, the team produced the longest period of sustained success since Elton Rynearson's days. The team posted winning seasons in all seven years of Boisture's coaching, including a 13-game winning streak that remains a school record. His 1971 squad finished the regular season 7‚Äì0‚Äì2, only allowing one touchdown in the last five games, before losing to Louisiana Tech in the Pioneer Bowl, the first bowl trip in school history. Boisture was named NCAA District Four \\"coach of the year\\" in 1971. Boisture's tenure at Eastern Michigan is also notable for the construction of Rynearson Stadium. Boisture's teams played their first two seasons at the old field, near the corner of Oakwood and Washtenaw, just west of McKenny Union. In 1969, the new stadium, which was considered off-campus at the time, opened with a capacity of 15,500. Boisture's bowl-bound 1971 team played for one of the few sellout crowds in the stadium's history, a 0‚Äì0 tie against Eastern Kentucky on October 16, 1971, which drew 17,360 spectators. In February 1974, Boisture left Eastern Michigan to coach the Detroit Wheels, in the Central Division of the World Football League, who also played home games at Rynearson Stadium. After playing a partial 1974 season of 14 games (out of a planned 20 game season), for a 1‚Äì13 record, the Wheels folded. Following his experience with the World Football League, Boisture decided to leave coaching. \\"It was a hardship on the family, moving like we were moving...When the Wheels went defunct, I could have gone with a couple pro teams, and I said, 'That's it.'...I was in a position to continue in pro ball or get something more stable. I made the right choice.\\" He and his family settled in Wyandotte, Michigan, and started a marketing firm dealing internationally with military equipment, from which he retired in 1990. Boisture was inducted into Eastern Michigan University's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2005. Boisture was the older brother of Tom Boisture, who played football at Mississippi State University and later coached at the University of Houston and the College of the Holy Cross. His grandson, Joe, played quarterback for Michigan State.http://www.msuspartans.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/boisture_joe00.html Head coaching record References External links * Category:1925 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American football ends Category:American men's basketball players Category:Detroit Titans football players Category:Detroit Mercy Titans men's basketball players Category:Detroit Wheels coaches Category:Eastern Michigan Eagles football coaches Category:Michigan State Spartans football coaches Category:High school football coaches in Michigan Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:United States Marines Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:People from Wyandotte, Michigan Category:Players of American football from Michigan ","title":"Dan Boisture"},{"id":"27077749","text":"Gymnophalloides heardi is a parasitic fluke that infects the marsh rice rat Oryzomys palustris and the clapper rail Rallus crepitans.

It is an amendment to Military Order No. 329, \\"Order Regarding Prevention of Infiltration\\", and significantly expands the definition of 'infiltrator' such that any person in the West Bank could fall under the scope of the definition, and be subject to arrest or deportation by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) without judicial review. The order was signed by Gadi Shamni, Major General and commander of IDF Forces in the Judea and Samaria Area. The order modifies the 1969 definition of 'infiltrator' to encompass anyone who enters the West Bank illegally, as well as anyone, \\"who is present in the Area and does not lawfully hold a permit.\\" The original 1969 definition of 'infiltrator' applied only to those who entered Israel illegally after passing through 'enemy states' (Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria). The military order does not clarify what kind of permit is required, and thus leaves it open for the Israeli authorities in the West Bank to interpret it. According to Amnesty International, those considered to be 'infiltrators' can be deported to other states, forcibly transferred to the Gaza Strip, or face criminal charges. This could include Palestinians whose address is recorded as being the Gaza Strip, even if they were live in or were born in the West Bank. The military order was first used on 21 April 2010 when Israel authorities deported a Palestinian prisoner to the Gaza Strip after he was released following a nine-year prison sentence. Criticism On 21 April 2010, the South African government expressed \\"the greatest concern\\" over the order, saying it has a broad definition of \\"infiltrator\\" and unclear terms as to which permits would allow a person to reside in the West Bank, as well as how valid residency might be proven. The South African government said the terms of the order are \\"reminiscent of pass laws under apartheid South Africa\\".Media Statement: Israeli Infiltration Order 1650 (Issued by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation) Richard Falk, the United Nations Special Rapporteur \\"on the situation of human rights in Palestinian territories occupied since 1967\\", warned that the order may violate international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention. Various human rights organizations have criticized the order. Dalia Kerstein, director of the Israel-based HaMoked, requested a delay in implementing the order because of its drastic effect on human rights. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network \\"condemns and demands the immediate annulment of Israeli Military Orders 1649 'Order regarding Security provisions' and 1650 'Order regarding Prevention of Infiltration'\\". Amnesty International worried that order 1650 \\"could facilitate the expulsion of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank.\\" See also *Prevention of Infiltration Law References Category:Human rights abuses in Israel Category:Human rights in the West Bank Category:Israel Defense Forces ","title":"Israeli Military Order 1650"},{"id":"27077770","text":"These are the highlights of the 2004-05 Mercyhurst Lakers women's ice hockey season.

The most severe activity was on April 24, particularly in Mississippi. The outbreak was responsible for ten tornado-related fatalities on April 24, all in Mississippi from a single supercell that crossed the entire state. Meteorological synopsis =April 22‚Äì23= A complex weather system began to track across the central and southern United States beginning on April 22. Scattered thunderstorms initially developed across the central and eastern Great Plains region late during the afternoon and then moved into the southeast Texas Panhandle and the Osage Plains during the evening and overnight hours. Large hail occurred with the stronger storms, but the most severe storms produced damaging winds and tornadoes. By late evening, new activity developed into a line of storms which swept through the Osage Plains. Many tornadoes were produced in southeastern Colorado, but they occurred over open fields and did not cause a significant amount of damage. However, one tornado in south central Kiowa County destroyed a small (15 foot x 30 foot) barn. In Kansas, numerous tornado-producing storms caused damage across a number of southwest Kansas counties. The public first reported a mile-wide tornado at around 4:40 pm west of Lakin. The storm tracked two miles southwest of Lakin at about 5:10 pm and was spotted again six miles northwest of Deerfield at approximately 5:40 pm. A tornadic storm in Kearny County uprooted trees and caused power outages at residences west of Lakin. No injuries were reported from it. In Finney County, no damage or injuries were reported from tornadic activity that traveled mostly above open farmland. In Scott County, a tornado was spotted four miles south of Scott City at about 7:10 p.m. Grain bins near Scott City were damaged, a barn partially collapsed with part of its roof torn off and some trees and power lines were reported down from it. The strongest tornado in Kansas occurred in Kearny County and was rated EF2. There were numerous tornadoes in the Texas Panhandle and one tornado in the Oklahoma Panhandle, which included one that was rated EF3 in Cottle County, Texas. Wall cloud west of Troy, Missouri On April 23, an upper level storm system increased in strength as it moved from the southern Rockies to the southern Great Plains region. A cold front moved across east-central Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and the Missouri River Valley through the night. Moist air ahead of the cold front in the south central states allowed for strong to severe thunderstorms to develop across the Mississippi Valley. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued across the Ark-La-Tex region and lower Mississippi Valley. There were five EF0 tornadoes in east Texas and southwest Arkansas during the late night and into the early morning of April 24. One tornado in Missouri traveled for , but did not cause any significant damage. =April 24= Storm Prediction Center risk map for severe thunderstorms on April 24, 2010. The high risk was later expanded northward. On April 24, an energetic upper level storm system strengthened as it moved from Texas to the southern Great Lakes Region. A cold front moved eastward across the middle and lower Mississippi River Valley before heading into the Ohio River Valley and stretched into the Mid-South portion of the United States. In front of the cold front, a warm, moist and unstable air mass spread northward from the lower Mississippi River Valley and northern Gulf Coast States into the middle Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. There were already thunderstorms that had formed during the morning hours and the conditions would only become more numerous throughout the day. This set the stage for a significant severe weather outbreak with the potential for strong and violent tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds. As a result, the Storm Prediction Center issued a rare high risk of severe weather for portions of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky, the first such issuance since April 26, 2009. Four \\"particularly dangerous situation\\" tornado watches were issued that day for areas of Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. The outbreak of severe weather caused NASCAR to call off the Aaron's 312 race in Talladega, Alabama. In Tennessee, there were three EF1 tornadoes and an EF0 tornado on April 24, and an EF2 early on April 25. The EF2 struck after 2 a.m. and caused damage in three counties. Despite extensive structural damage, there were no injuries. Alabama was hard hit by tornadoes on this day. An EF4 tornado struck southeastern DeKalb County in the Mount Vernon area. The most serious damage occurred near the intersection of County Roads 80 and 55, where a church and a two-story home were destroyed. Several mobile homes were destroyed and numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted. Five injuries occurred from this tornado. An EF3 tornado touched down in south Albertville. Throughout the event, the tornado skipped and hit other places along its path from Marshall County to Geraldine in DeKalb County. The first damage reports came in at around 10:15 p.m. The storm left the downtown area of Albertville in complete destruction, then downed trees and power lines in DeKalb County. Fifty-nine homes in Albertville were destroyed by the tornado. Another 198 had major damage while 157 had minor damage ‚Äì a total of 414 homes impacted by the storm. It also caused damage to the middle and high school in Albertville. Another EF3 tornado touched down in Parrish and tracked through Cordova and Corner. Significant damage to buildings occurred in Parrish and Cordova, while Corner and Blount County primarily suffered uprooted or broken trees, with at least one travel trailer overturned and some minor structural damage. Arkadelphia Road near Skyline Road was blocked for a time by fallen trees and debris. A total of 70 to 80 homes and businesses sustained damage from the tornado. A third EF3 tornado in Alabama struck a trailer park in Mentone. The tornado destroyed nine of the 11 manufactured homes in the park. Seven people were injured from it. The severe weather and tornadoes also wreaked havoc across Mississippi. Near Starkville, an EF2 tornado destroyed an unoccupied mobile home and damaged 20 homes, as well as snapping and uprooting numerous trees, damaging a barn and snapped three power poles. Ten people were killed and 146 others were injured when an EF4 tornado, which started in Louisiana, tore through the state of Mississippi. An EF2 tornado that moved over Jasper and Lauderdale counties caused significant structural damage to a church and destroyed an outbuilding. An EF1 tornado that moved over Lauderdale and Kemper counties damaged or destroyed four barns and destroyed one shed. In all, 319 homes were damaged in Yazoo County; 114 in Choctaw County; 60 in Holmes County; 48 homes and three businesses were damaged in Monroe County; 63 homes damaged in Union County; 42 homes damaged in Warren County; and 35 homes damaged in Attala County. Tallulah-Yazoo City-Durant tornado The most catastrophic storm of the entire outbreak cultivated over northern Louisiana during the late morning hours of April 24. The tornado became strong almost immediately, bending and destroying several high-tension power poles west of Tallulah. The tornado then crossed Interstate 20, blowing an 18-wheeler off the road. As the tornado passed northwest and north of Tallulah, it heavily damaged or destroyed a number of homes. Before crossing the Mississippi River, it caused near total destruction of a chemical plant near the Omega community. It crossed the Mississippi River shortly thereafter, and damaged or destroyed numerous homes on the north side of Eagle Lake. The tornado then moved across the Delta National Forest in Issaquena and Sharkey Counties, causing major tree damage. The tornado again caused significant home damage northwest of Satartia, and again as it crossed MS 3 near the Crupp community. The tornado then moved through rural areas southwest of Yazoo City, causing major damage or total destruction of a number of homes, as well as intense tree damage. The tornado was also rain-wrapped at times when about to go near the southwestern sections of Yazoo City. As the tornado approached the intersection of U.S. Route 49 and Highway 16 on the south side of Yazoo City, it reached its widest point and maximum intensity. Several buildings, including a church and several businesses, were totally destroyed or even flattened. The tornado continued moving through residential areas on the southeast side of Yazoo City, heavily damaging or destroying numerous homes. The tornado continued northeast through rural eastern Yazoo and southern Holmes Counties, causing intense tree damage and damaging or destroying a number of rural residences. As the tornado moved by the Franklin community in rural Holmes County, it again reached EF4 intensity as it completely destroyed two brick homes and heavily damaged or destroyed a number of other homes. Doppler radar images of the tornadic supercell as the tornado hit Yazoo City. 0.5-degree elevation, base reflectivity on the left, storm relative velocity on the right. Note the visible \\"debris ball\\" just southeast of Yazoo City on the reflectivity display. The tornado then crossed Interstate 55, causing significant tree damage and blowing a number of vehicles off the road. As the tornado approached the area just south of Durant and crossed US 51, it narrowed and reached one of its weaker points in its track, but was still on the ground. However, shortly thereafter it re-intensified somewhat and began causing significant tree damage in rural western Attala County. The tornado continued across northern Attala County, causing tree damage and heavily damaging a number of rural residences, including in the community of Hesterville. The tornado intensified further as it crossed the Natchez Trace Parkway, and once again produced high-end EF3 damage as it passed northwest of Weir. Numerous homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The tornado maintained strong intensity as it crossed the remainder of Choctaw County, including damaging a number of homes as it cross Highways 415, 9 and Highways 15. The tornado rapidly narrowed and weakened as it crossed into Oktibbeha County, and dissipated north of the town of Sturgis after being on the ground for nearly three hours. The tornado tracked , making it the fourth longest in Mississippi history. The tornado was up to wide at its widest point, making it the second- largest tornado ever in Mississippi, after the 2.25 mile wide Bassfield, Mississippi EF4 tornado on April 12, 2020. The 10 fatalities and 146 injuries made it Mississippi's ninth deadliest tornado since 1900. The tornado was rated as an EF4, producing its most severe damage in Yazoo and Holmes Counties. The tornado's wind speed peaked at . It was the state's worst natural disaster since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Retrieved 10 March 2010 Seasonal and regional water scarcity exacerbates the difficulty to improve water supply. The Kenyan water sector underwent far-reaching reforms through the Water Act No. 8 of 2002. Previously service provision had been the responsibility of a single National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation as well as of a few local utilities established since 1996. After the passage of the act service provision was gradually decentralised to 91 local Water Service Providers (WSPs). These were linked to 8 regional Water Services Boards (WSBs) in charge of asset management through Service Provision Agreements (SPAs) with the WSPs. The Act also created a national regulatory board that carries out performance benchmarking and is in charge of approving SPAs and tariff adjustments. With the Water Bill, 2014, the functions of the 8 WSBs were transferred to 47 Water Works Development Boards in each county of Kenya. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation remains in charge of policies for water supply, while the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation is in charge of policies for sanitation. Although urban water tariffs are high by regional standards (60 KSh or US$0.60 per m3 on average in 2014), these tariffs only allow the recovery of operating costs, but not the recovery of capital costs. Full cost recovery is not achieved due to various reasons, including a high level of non-revenue water (average of 42%). Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million. Another reason is the need to tap distant water sources at a high cost in some locations. For example, Mombasa is supplied from a source located 220 km from the city. Although 16% of Kenyans in urban areas have access to sewerage, there is no sewerage levy in Kenya, making this expensive service essentially free of charge.  Data sources and interpretation  Collecting reliable data on the Kenyan water and sanitation sector is difficult because reporting is often incomplete and different definitions are being used. Two sources of nationwide representative information are censuses carried out every ten years, with the next one scheduled for 2019,Kenya Census, accessed on 9 May 2010 and Demographic and Health Surveys carried out every five years by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The data thus collected are analysed by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF to assess progress towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.African Ministers' Council on Water, AMCOW and Water and Sanitation Program (2006) Getting Africa on Track to Meet the MDGs on Water Supply and Sanitation ‚Äì A Status Review of Sixteen African Countries, pp.33‚Äì43. Retrieved 6 March 2010 These data only assess the availability of water and sanitation infrastructure. They do not assess whether water is safe to drink, sufficient in quantity, continuously available or affordable. Another important source of information is the annual \\"impact report\\" published by the water regulatory agency WASREB since 2008. Through this report much more detailed information is publicly available today on many water service providers than in the past and than in many other countries. However, data in the report refer only to the population served by Water Service Providers, which is not the entire population of Kenya, omitting particularly parts of rural areas.  Access  Kibera, Nairobi, an example of lack of access to basic sanitation. = Water supply = Estimates from the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) show that 58% of Kenyans (83% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas) had access to at least basic drinking water sources in 2015. 22% of Kenyans (45% in urban areas and 14% in rural areas) are reported as having access to piped water through a house or yard connection. According to the JMP estimates, access to improved water sources in urban areas decreased from 92% in 1990 to 82% in 2015. In rural areas, however, access increased from 33% to 57% during the same period.Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation: Improved Drinking Water Coverage Estimates ‚Äì Kenya, March 2010 Retrieved 24 April 2010 The total number of people lacking access to \\"at least basic\\" clean water in 2015 was 19 million people.

For example, the 2007 Citizen Report Card survey showed that users of water kiosks in cities fetch water 4‚Äì6 times per day. In Kisumu, this meant that a poor household spent 112 minutes per day to fetch water at normal times, and as much as 200 minutes per day during times of scarcity.Uwazi InfoShop at Twaweza:It‚Äôs our water too! Bringing greater equity in access to water in Kenya, Policy brief 09/2010, p. 3 = Sanitation = The total number of people lacking access to at least basic sanitation in 2015 was 32 million people. Countrywide estimates for 2015 by the JMP indicate that 30% (43% of urban and 28% of rural) Kenyans had access to at least basic sanitation, including sewerage. In urban areas an additional 27% of the population used shared latrines. In rural areas, open defecation was estimated to be still practised by 12% of the population. The 2015 report by the Water and Sanitation Regulatory Board did not include any figures on access to sanitation in the broad sense, but only an estimate of access to sewerage in urban areas, which was estimated at 16%. In 2006‚Äì2007 it had been reported that half of the Kenyan population within the service area of 55 WSPs had access to improved sanitation facilities (this definition includes flush, pour flush toilets connected to a piped system, septic tanks, VIP latrines and pit latrines). In Nairobi, sanitation coverage was about 23% in 2006‚Äì2007. The Kenyan Integrated Household Budget Survey of 2006 reported a much higher sanitation coverage 84%, including shared latrines and shallow pit latrines.Ministry of Water and Irrigation: Annual Water Sector Review 2009, pp.35‚Äì40 \\"Water Services, Sanitation\\" Retrieved 1 March 2010  Service quality  The quality of service of WSPs is closely monitored by the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) with the aim of promoting comparative competition and performance improvements. Some of the most important indicators of service quality are water quality, continuity of water supply and wastewater treatment. Water quality. In 2015 WASREB reported that 23 utilities provided good quality water (defined as more than 95% compliance with standards), 15 acceptable quality and for 53 utilities water quality was not acceptable (defined as less than 90% compliance). The two parameters measured were residual chlorine (40% weight) and compliance with bacteriological standards (60% weight). If the number of samples taken was lower than foreseen in the standard, the compliance was rated lower. The highest compliance was achieved in Kericho and Kisumu with 100% each. A citizens' report carried out in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu in 2007 provided information about customers' perception of water quality: around 70% of households using water from connections to the mains said they found the taste and smell of water acceptable, and that the water was clear. Even so, the vast majority of respondents treat water prior to consumption, which shows continuing uncertainty about its quality.Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007 Retrieved 5 March 2010 In Kisumu, which receives its water from nearby Lake Victoria, over 40% of citizens report scarcity of drinking water. Continuity of supply. The 2015 Impact Report reports an average supply of 18 hours per day, up from 14 hours in 2006‚Äì07. Only in nine mostly small WSPs water is provided continuously 24 hours per day. In Nairobi water is provided on average for 18 hours a day and in Mombasa for 6 hours. Nonetheless, instances of water scarcity (defined as more than five days without or with insufficient water supply) still occur in Kenya. In 2006 in Kisumu over 40% of households (both poor and non-poor) connected to water mains reported scarcity. The greatest difference between the poor and non-poor was recorded in Nairobi, where poor households were more than twice as likely to say they experienced scarcity. A higher percentage of kiosk users reported scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections. Wastewater treatment. According to an assessment report carried out in 2009, there are 43 sewerage systems in Kenya and waste water treatment plants in 15 towns (total population served: 900,000 inhabitants). The operation capacity of these wastewater treatment plants is estimated at around 16% of design capacity. The main reasons for this inefficiency are inadequate operation and maintenance and low connection rate to sewers. In Kenya, the estimated connection rate is 19% (12% according to another report).R. Gakubia, U. Pokorski and P. Onyango Upscaling Access to Sustainable Sanitation ‚Äì Kenya, January 2010, slide 7. Retrieved 16 March 2010 Of the wastewater that enters the sewer network, only about 60% reaches the treatment plants. The most common solution used for wastewater treatment in Kenya are waste stabilisation ponds.

Pit latrine users from Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa indicated that some wastewater empties into storm sewers, soak-aways and cess pits designed for kitchen waste, thus causing environmental pollution. In 2001 a pollution incident occurred in the town of Embu.

The closed Rift Valley Inland Drainage system includes a number of rivers and lakes, including large freshwater lakes such as Lake Turkana, Lake Baringo and Lake Naivasha, rivers such as the Kerio River, as well as a number of salt lakes. The Athi Drainage system, the Tana Drainage system and the Ewaso Ng'iro North Drainage system all flow towards the Indian Ocean. The water distribution in the basins is highly uneven with the highest water availability in the Lake Victoria Basin (more than 50%) and the lowest in the Athi Drainage system. Only the Tana and Lake Victoria Basins, have surplus water resources while the three other basins face deficits. The capital city Nairobi receives its water resources from two drainage systems: The oldest sources, the Kikuyu Springs (used since 1906) and the Ruiru Dam (since 1938) are located in the Athi River Basin. The Sasumua Dam, the Ndakaini-Thika Dam (since 1996) and Chania-B Dam supply Nairobi through interbasin transfer from the Tana River drainage area.

Retrieved 22 April 2010  History and recent developments  The history of the water and sanitation sector in Kenya is characterised by institutional fragmentation that led to numerous inefficiencies and by subsequent attempts at reform. =Beginnings= The history of piped water supply in Kenya can be traced back to the period of the East African Protectorate. At that time water supply was focused on the needs of colonial settlements. The administration of water supply was carried out by the Hydraulic Branch of the Public Works Department, which started operating in the coastal city of Mombasa. The construction of the Uganda Railway in 1896 provided an important impetus for the development of water pipelines in the interior of the country along the railway line. =Colonial period= Between 1920 and independence in 1963 the first attempts were made at regulating water supply in the colony and protectorate of Kenya, while responsibility was shared by many institutions. In the 1950s and early 60s, responsibility for the administration of water supply was split between three institutions: the Ministry of Works operating in urban centres with centralised water service provision; Local Authorities that were deemed capable of managing water supply; and the Water Development Department, which was responsible for developing new water supplies for urban and rural centres. Bulk water to Mombasa was provided by the Mombasa Pipeline Work, while day-to-day operations of water pipelines were carried out by the water department. There was no single framework for the administration and management of water. In 1952 the Water Act Cap 372 was enacted, which remained the legal basis for the water sector until 2002.Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S.

In the sanitation subsector there was no functioning institutional framework either. Officially, the 1921 Public Health Ordinance gave the Ministry of Health the role of administering sanitation, but it was rarely enforced. The local population, moreover, was reluctant to adopt sanitary measures imposed by the colonial government. Between 1929 and 1939 intense public health education campaigns were carried out which led to the diffusion of pit latrines.Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S. Ombongi History of Water Supply and Sanitation in Kenya, 1895‚Äì2002 in Juuti, Katko and Vuorinen (Eds.) Environmental History of Water (IWA Publishing 2007), Section on Sanitation in Kenya: pp.296‚Äì305. Retrieved 24 March 2010 By 1954 different types of sanitation were in use in different parts of Kenya: pit latrines were in use in most native reserves, bucket type latrines prevailed in towns while waterborne sanitation was used in the European quarters of major towns. During the Mau Mau uprising Africans were concentrated in detention camps and local markets were kept closed out of fear of rebellion. This led to the neglect of adequate sanitation and in the proliferation of communal latrines. =Independent Kenya (1963‚Äì1980)= As Kenya gained independence in 1963, attempts at simplifying the administration of water supply resulted in the transferral of all organisations responsible for water to the Ministry of Agriculture in 1964. The distribution of responsibilities and authority was, however, unclear and led to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. In 1965 the government led by Jomo Kenyatta stated in the Sessional Paper No. 10 on African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya that government policy had to be directed towards the eradication of poverty, illiteracy and disease.Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S. Ombongi History of Water Supply and Sanitation in Kenya, 1895‚Äì2002 in Juuti, Katko and Vuorinen (Eds.)

Retrieved 24 March 2010 This initiated a period of active involvement in water policy by the government, based on the principle that water is a social good to be either provided free of charge or subsidised. As a result, water tariffs between 1970 and 1981 were heavily subsidised and in contradiction with the principle of operating cost recovery. Throughout the 1960s, the Environmental Sanitation Programme supported by WHO- UNICEF was carried out in Kenya with the aims of developing water supplies for small rural communities, improving waste disposal methods and providing sanitary education for the rural population. The rural water supply schemes set up as part of the programme were operated by County Councils (under the Ministry of Local Government). In 1972 about 560 rural water supply schemes were running in Kenya and provided water to a population of about 664,000, UNICEF reported. Local communities also started developing their own water supplies and set up water committees: they received training about design systems, hydraulic calculations, costs and submission methods. A follow-up study by UNICEF carried out in 1974 showed the many problems that affected these projects. In 1970 the Government of Kenya signed a credit agreement with Sweden to finance Rural Water Supply Development. The WHO was to provide a study of the water situation in the country. The study, completed in 1973, showed that in Kenya there was a major lack in senior and technical staff; while donors could provide most development funds, current expenditure could not be covered by local funds and the Government lacked a long-term plan of water supply development. In response, a fully fledged Ministry of Water Resources Management and Development was created in 1974. The ministry took over government operated water schemes as well as those operated by county councils. In the same year the National Water Master Plan Initiative was launched. Its primary aim was to develop new water supply schemes and secure access to potable water within reasonable distance to all Kenyans. The initiative bore the slogan, ‚ÄúWater for all by the year 2000.‚Äù =Transition period (1980‚Äì1992)= In the 1980s, the government began experiencing budget constraints which put a strain on the ambitious projects of providing universal access to safe water and expanding the water and sewerage systems. Priority was given to the rehabilitation of existing schemes and the construction of large-scale water projects such as the Baricho and Kilimanjaro water schemes. In 1980 a National Sanitation Council was established to sensitise the population about the health benefits of sanitation and to advise and guide local authorities on the matter. The council slowly faded without accomplishing its mandate. In 1983 a Water Use Study carried out by SIDA confirmed that the situation was unsustainable and suggested decentralisation and removing operation and maintenance responsibilities from the Ministry. To improve performance and efficiency and to reduce the financial burden of the water sector, in June 1988 the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation (NWCPC) was established. Its role was to operate water supply systems under state control on a commercial basis. =Commercialization of local utilities= But the centralised approach failed to achieve improvements. Thus the idea of creating local-government owned commercial utilities emerged. A Second National Water Master Plan was formulated in 1992, and a new policy approach emphasising decentralisation and a demand-driven approach was discussed at the national level. The city of Eldoret went ahead in 1994 and set up a water and sewer department with finances that were separate from the municipal budget. The utility's board includes representatives of NGOs, women's organisations, the chamber of commerce and industry and the Kenya Consumer Organization. The commercialisation of the utility in Eldoret as well as in Nyeri and Kericho was supported by the German development co-operation.Wambua Sammy:Water Privatisation in Kenya, Global Issue Paper No. 8, Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, 2004, p. 12-15. The approach was formalised by the Ministry of Local Government, through the Companies Act Cap. 486 of 1996 which allowed the establishment of publicly owned, commercially run water and sanitation companies. As of 2002, this approach had led to significant improvements in terms of reduced of non-revenue water, improved bill collection and fewer complaints in Nyeri and Eldoret. However, other local water companies in Kitale and Nakuru had to be taken over again by the national government due to financial problems.Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S.

Retrieved 24 March 2010 In 1999, the first National Policy of Water Resources Management and Development was published. The policy stated that the government would hand over urban water systems to autonomous departments within local authorities, and rural water supply to communities. Another provision of this document was placing water and sanitation services under single utilities. While developing the National Water Policy, the Government also established a National Task Force to review the Water Act, Cap 372, and draft amendments that would result in a complete overhaul of the sector. =Reorganisation of water institutions (2002‚Äì2011)= The current legal framework for the Kenyan water and sanitation sector is based on the Water Act No. 8 of 2002 which became effective in March 2003.Water Act 2002 Retrieved 18 March 2010 The 2002 Water Act introduced far-reaching reforms based on the following principles: * the separation of the management of water resources from the provision of water services; * the separation of policy making from day-to-day administration and regulation; * decentralisation of functions to lower level state organs; * the involvement of non-government entities in the management of water resources and in the provision of water services. The implementation of these principles triggered a wide-ranging restructuring of the sector and led to the creation of new institutions. The Water Sector Reform Secretariat (WSRS) was formed as a transitional unit in the Ministry of Water and Irrigation to oversee the formation of the new water sector institutions. In 2004, the Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) was established to provide financial assistance towards capital investment costs in areas lacking adequate services (usually inhabited by the poor). A Transfer Plan was devised in 2005 (through Legal Notice No. 101 of the 12 August 2005) to direct the transfer of staff and assets from the central government to the newly founded Water Services Boards and Water Service Providers (for detailed role descriptions see the next paragraph).Albert Mumma Kenya‚Äôs new water law: an analysis of the implications for the rural poor 26‚Äì28 January 2005.

Its mission is to \\"realise the goals of the MDG declaration and the Vision 2030 of the Kenyan Government concerning access to safe and affordable water and basic sanitation by responsive institutions within a regime of well- defined standards and regulation.\\" NWSS is based on the identification of sustainable access to safe water and basic sanitation as a human right and an economic good. Among the core commitments are: cost recovery by water service providers to ensure sustainable water and sanitation for all and the formalisation of service provision.Ministry of Water and Irrigation: The National Water Services Strategy (NWSS) Retrieved 3 March 2010 In addition, MWI also elaborated pro-poor implementation plans. In 2010 Kenya adopted a new constitution that enshrines the human right to water and sanitation in Article 43(1). Specifically, it states that every person has the right \\"to accessible and adequate housing and to reasonable standards of sanitation\\", as well as the right \\"to clean and safe water in adequate quantities\\". =New Water Bill= A new water bill was passed in 2015. The bill transforms the 8 Water Service Boards (Asset Holding Companies) into 47 Water Works Development Boards in each county of Kenya. This in line with the decentralisation prescribed in the 2010 Constitution of Kenya. Also, the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation became the National Water Storage Authority, the Water Services Regulatory Board became the Water Services Regulatory Commission and the Water Services Trust Fund became the Water Sector Trust Authority. The Bill is meant as an improved version of the Water Act of 2002, rather than another fundamental reform of the sector. The bill - under discussion since 2012 - was finally passed by Parliament as The Water Bill, 2014 (Bill No. 7 of 2014) on July 7, 2015.  Responsibility for water supply and sanitation  = Policy formulation and sector coordination = The Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) is the key institution responsible for the water sector in Kenya. The Ministry is divided into five departments: Administration and Support Services, Water Services, Water Resources Management, Irrigation, Drainage and Water Storage, and Land Reclamation.

The population of low- income settlements such as Kibera depends on water provided by informal small service providers. Informal small service providers (SSPs) provide water in both rural and urban low-income settlements. Some of them sell water from tanker trucks or through jerry cans, often at prices that are five to ten times that of piped water supply. Others are self-help groups, often run by women, who provide piped water supply. The Water Services Trust Fund is making efforts to formalise service provision in low-income settlements. It has developed two national concepts for service provision for the poor. The first one is the Community Project Cycle, which makes funds available for local communities that are willing to comply with minimum service standards. The second one, the \\"Urban Poor Concept\\" has been implemented in low-income urban areas since 2007 and has led to the construction of numerous water kiosks that meet sustainability standards.Ministry of Water and Irrigation: Annual Water Sector Review 2009, pp.65‚Äì66 \\"Human right to WSS.\\" Retrieved 1 March 2010 An example of a partnership between a utility and self-help groups can be found in Nyalenda, a poor neighbourhood with about 60,000 inhabitants in Kisumu.

It was created in 1998 to take over the Kenya operations of WaterAid UK when the latter decided to close down its operations in Kenya.  Public opinion, consumer feedback and allegations of corruption  Public opinion. A 2008 survey of Kenyan public opinion reported that water supply is not considered as a high priority for government action. Only about 5% of respondents said that water supply was among the ten most important issues that the government should address, even though 60% think that the government is handling the issue badly. The survey also monitored instances of corruption in the sub-sector: 15% of urban and 11% of rural respondents reported that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favour to government officials to get water or sanitation services in the past year.Afrobarometer Survey 2008 ‚Äì Kenya Survey based on a nationally representative random sample of 1,104 Kenyans. Retrieved 20 March 2011 Allegations of corruption. In September 2010, Water Minister Charity Ngilu admitted in Parliament that corruption was rampant in public water institutions, including all the eight water services boards and the National Water and Conservation Pipeline Corporation.IRC E-Source:Kenya: Minister admits corruption is rampant in public water institutions, 1 November 2010 The Kenya Water and Sanitation Civil Society Network (Kewasnet) called the statement the \\"height of hypocrisy and double standards\\", claiming that the Minister had only talked publicly about corruption in the sector after the Daily Nation newspaper had uncovered the corruption. Shortly before the chief executive officer of the Tanathi Water Services Board had been suspended after a WASREB audit of the board alleging corruption.[allAfrica.com]:Kenya: Water Chief Sent Home As Probe Starts, 20 September 2010 The report had been published in March 2010 without action being taken for six months. According to Kewasnet, \\"governance in the water sector is at its worst and lowest ebb.\\"Kenya Water and Sanitation Civil Society Network (Kewasnet):Why Kenya water minister Ngilu is not honest on anti-corruption, 1 October 2010 Feedback from consumers. In 2010 WASREB and local utilities helped to establish Water and Sanitation Action Groups (WAGs) consisting of citizen volunteers in Kisumu, Kakagemam, Nairobi and Mombasa to provide a forum for dialogue and for feedback from consumers. Consumer complained about inaccurate billing and metering, pipe bursts, illegal connections, poor workmanship on installations, vandalism, overcharging and corruption. Utility staff were initially suspicious and even hostile. The feedback was done in the form of focus group discussions, public hearings and scheduled meetings between citizen representatives and utility managers. While 63% of the complaints were resolved after 8 months, it remains to be seen if the system will become permanent or will be extended to other cities.  Economic efficiency  The economic performance of Kenyan Water Service Providers is closely monitored by WASREB and made available in the Impact Report to encourage competition and spread best practices. Important indicators of economic efficiency are: collection rates, the level of non- revenue water, metering ratios and labour productivity. Most Kenyan Water Service Providers do not meet the benchmarks in these dimensions. Collection rate. In 2013-14 most Kenyan WSPs recorded good revenue collection efficiencies with an average of 93%, up from 86% in 2006‚Äì07. The worst performing utility was Mawingo with 40% of the billed amount being collected. In some utilities, the collection rate exceeded 100% because WSPs were able to collect outstanding arrears. Non-revenue water. On average, 42% of the supplied water in Kenya was not billed in 2013‚Äì2014, e.g. due to leakage or water theft. Only one Water Services Providers (Nyeri) met the benchmark set by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation with levels of NRW of less than 20%. In Nairobi NRW levels were 39%, in Mombasa 48%. Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million. Metering ratio. The metering ratio of Kenyan water utilities was 89% in 2013‚Äì14, up from 82% in 2006‚Äì2007. There is, however, uncertainty about whether the installed water meters are in fact functioning. The metering ratio in Nairobi had been increased to 99% in 2006‚Äì07, but then declined again to 94% in 2013‚Äì14.Metering Ratio ‚Äì WASREB Impact Report 2009, pp.31‚Äì33. Retrieved 10 March 2010 Labour productivity. In 2013‚Äì2014 there were on average 7 employees per 1000 water connections in Kenya, a significant improvement over 11 in 2006‚Äì07. Seven Water Service Providers, all of them large, attained good levels of labour productivity, with 5 or less workers per 1000 connections, up from only one in 2006‚Äì07.Staff per 1000 connections ‚Äì WASREB Impact Report 2009, pp.35‚Äì36. Retrieved 10 March 2010  Financial aspects  = Cost recovery= In 2014 the WSPs recovered, on average, 100% of operation and maintenance costs. However, all but four utilities fell short of the target to cover 150% of operation and maintenance costs in order to service debt and to develop their infrastructure. Water Services Boards should be cover their administrative costs through the Regulatory Levy they collect from WSPs in their service area. In fact, only Athi WSB was able to meet 115% of operational costs in 2006/2007. The other WSBs were still heavily reliant on government subsidies.Performance analysis of Water services boards ‚Äì WASREB Impact Report 2009, pp.54‚Äì57. Retrieved 10 March 2010 =Tariff level= The average water tariff reported in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure is not very indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means that for the first 10 m3 a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there are problems with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff. Information about tariffs at water kiosks is contradictory. A 2007 report about three Kenyan cities says that the unit rate for water kiosks was 10 KSh/m3 in Nairobi, 15 KSh/m3 in Mombasa, and 55 KSh/m3 in Kisumu.Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007, p. 51, Retrieved 20 March 2011 However, the same report states earlier on that water kiosk users pay 100 KSh/m3 in all three cities, which is said to be two to five times more than what is paid by those who get their water delivered to their homes through the network.Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007, p. 3, Retrieved 20 March 2011 There is no sewer tariff in Kenya, so that properties connected to the sewer network receive this service for free, although sewerage and wastewater treatment is at least as expensive as drinking water supply. In 2013 a study commissioned by the regulator recommended the introduction of a 5% sewerage levy as a surcharge on the water bill. Besides tariffs, Kenya has also introduced charges for the abstraction of groundwater and surface water. =Tariff adjustments= Tariff setting is the responsibility of Water Services Boards and Water Service Providers according to operation and maintenance costs. Tariffs have to be approved by WASREB, which can also mandate a WSB to formulate a tariff adjustment. There are three types of tariff adjustments, as described in the Tariff Guidelines: Regular Tariff Adjustments based on the WSPs' business plan; Extraordinary Tariff Adjustments when the cost structure undergoes significant changes; Automatic Tariff Adjustments every 12 months which might be part of a service provision agreement with a WSP.WASREB: Tariff Guidelines Retrieved 18 March 2010 In 2008 an Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment was granted to all WSPs as an interim measure to assist WSPs to meet their operation and maintenance costs. Tariffs for sewerage services are part of tariff adjustments and the aim is to reach full cost recovery also for sanitation. The ministry responsible for water is, however, aware that full cost recovery tariffs for sewerage for certain systems would make the service provision unaffordable for many connected households.Ministry of Water and Irrigation: Annual Water Sector Review 2009, pp.48‚Äì49 \\"WSS tariffs.\\" Retrieved 1 March 2010 =Investment= According to the Annual Water Sector Review 2013‚Äì14, investments in urban water and sanitation amounted to Kenyan Shilling (Ksh) 12 billion in 2013-14 (US$120m) compared to an investment need of around Ksh 75 billion annually (US$750m). According to the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, its budget for drinking water supply and sanitation had been KSh 18.7 billion or US$242.8 million in Fiscal Year 2008‚Äì09, and thus had been higher than investments in 2013‚Äì14. In the preceding five years, the budget for the water sector had been increased by 245% from KSh 4.2 billion (US$54.5 million) in 2004‚Äì2005. 82% of funds were allocated for the water supply and sanitation sub-sector, while the rest was devoted to Water Resources Management, for Irrigation Drainage and Water Storage as well as Land Reclamation. =Financing= According to the regulator, \\"the overwhelming dependency on development partners (i.e. external donors) with over 94% of the total investment funds provided in 2013/14 (does) not augur well for the sector.\\" The main sources of funding for Kenyan water institutions are three: government funds which had still constituted 58% of sector funding in 2008‚Äì2009, internally generated funds that had amounted to 11%, and donor contributions that made up 31% of the funds available at the time.

As of 2012 more than 12 million Kenyans and 85% of the urban population use mobile phones for Bank transactions. A study by the University of Oxford showed that prior to the introduction of this system residents of Kiamumbi on the outskirts of Nairobi had to make a 40-minute round trip on public transport, a wait in a lengthy queue to make a bank deposit and then present the slip at the offices of the water utility to pay their monthly bill. When the small utility serving the local water system allowed payments through M-Pesa in December 2010, within two months half their customers switched to the mobile phone payment system.

Jumpstarted by a $300,000 grant from the now-defunct CBS Foundation, thanks to connections through the father of co-founder Doug Liman, NACB became the first trade association specifically geared to all aspects of American student-staffed radio and television stations. (Other unaffiliated organizations, such as the National Broadcasting Society, Alpha Epsilon Rho, was geared to student journalists, and not all aspects of station operations, while the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, geared to College radio, did not embrace Student television stations until well after NACB's founding. The National Association of Educational Broadcasters was focused on professionally run stations based on college campuses that were typically National Public Radio affiliates.) Thanks in part to keynote addresses by legendary television journalist Walter Cronkite at its first national conference in November, 1988; media magnate Ted Turner the following year; and Quincy Jones at 1990's event, NACB put itself on the map quickly, reaching a peak of over 600 member stations in the US and a few internationally by 1992. Its National College Television and Radio Awards was the second (after the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' annual student competition) to give significant cash prizes for student productions in a wide range of programming categories that year, thanks to support from several of the US's major media companies, including CBS, ESPN, CNN, NBC, HBO, FOX, E! Entertainment, MTV Networks and Interep. Over its first few years, NACB hired three full-time staff to manage the association, at times including some graduating Brown students. The association continued to enjoy significant support from student volunteers and office space on campus donated by Brown University. Among its notable successes were U-Net (later trademarked as U Network), a satellite-delivered programming network featuring top student productions; regional conferences expanding from the national; the comprehensive Station Handbook manual, an annually updated guide for Campus radio and TV station operations;https://www.petascale.org/XDU/NFCB_Radio.pdf and a monthly print magazine, College Broadcaster, widely read among student managers and college station faculty advisors, published from 1989 through 1996. Unfortunately, the cost of delivering programming by satellite and the relatively few Student television station that could receive such programming at the time limited the reach of the network. In the mid-1990s, Lucie Salhany, head of the upstart television network by United Television and Paramount Pictures, made a modest unsolicited offer to buy the rights to the U Network name. NACB countered with a $100,000 request, which she refused, thus the network was named UPN instead of U. NACB's board of directors was composed of students and faculty, most of whom turned over annually and whose business savvy was understandably not as mature as the industry professionals it attracted to its conferences. Its advisory board of media luminaries never met physically and was infrequently tapped for assistance. Incorporated as a 501(c) non-profit, its revenue streams were limited to member dues (quite low, to account for limited student organization budgets), conference registrations, database list rentals and a few special projects, so donations continued to be vital to its survival. Due primarily to a lack of seasoned leadership who could build the relationships that insured continued philanthropic support, the organization ceased operations in 1998. Legacy: Realizing the vacuum left by NACB's demise, two of its member stations' faculty advisors (Will Robedee and Warren Kozireski) soon after founded College Broadcasters Inc., also a non-profit geared to college station operations.

Until 2001 it was part of the former borough of K√∂penick. History Rahnsdorf was first mentioned in 1375, having been founded as a fishermen's village with its own church. The latter burned down almost completely in 1872 and thus had to be rebuilt thereafter. In 1902, the Villenkolonie of Wilhelmshagen was built in the east of the village with Tabor Church. In 1920, Rahnsdorf was merged into the city of Berlin as a consequence of the \\"Greater Berlin Act\\" and from 1949 to 1990 it was part of East Berlin. History of Rahnsdorf on www.koepenick.net Geography =Overview= Located in the south-eastern suburb of Berlin, Rahnsdorf is the easternmost locality of the city. The easternmost point is represented by Springeberg, a ground located in front of Flakensee lake, bordering with Woltersdorf and Erkner, two municipalities of the Oder-Spree district, Brandenburg. Similar to an exclave it is linked to Berliner mainland with a road (Woltersdorfer Landstra√üe) forming a strip, as in Steinst√ºcken. The other municipality bordering with Rahnsdorf is Sch√∂neiche, also part of Oder-Spree. Another peculiarity of Rahnsdorfer borders with Brandenburg is represented by Landj√§gerallee, a road parallel to the railway that forms a thin and long strip belonging to Erkner surrounded by Berliner territory. The localities of Treptow-K√∂penick bordering with Rahnsdorf are Friedrichshagen, K√∂penick and M√ºggelheim. Surrounded by a big portion of the Berliner Stadtforst (city forest), Rahnsdorf counts two lakes in its territory: the eastern portion of M√ºggelsee (Berlin's largest lake by surface area), and the western one of D√§meritzsee. Between the M√ºggelspree river, an affluent of the Spree representing the border shared with M√ºggelheim, and the old town, it is located Neu-Venedig (New Venice), a residential settlement so named because it is crossed by numerous artificial canals. Infos at Neu-Venedig official site =Subdivisions= Rahnsdorf counts five zones (Ortslagen): * Rahnsdorf (Rahnsdorfer Muehle) * Alt-Rahnsdorf * Hessenwinkel * Neu-Venedig * Wilhelmshagen Transport As urban railways, the locality is served by S-Bahn line S3, at the stations of Rahnsdorf and Wilhelmshagen. It is also served by the tramway lines 61 and 87. The second, not operated by BVG and separated from the citizen network, connects Rahnsdorf station to Woltersdorf. Another separated line (88) crosses a little portion of the locality without stops. Rahnsdorf counts also two ferry lines, F23 and F24, running over M√ºggelspree, at M√ºggelwerderweg and Kruggasse.

The postal codes are 33597, which is shared by Webster to the northwest and 33514, which is shared by Center Hill to the north. Geography Mabel is bordered by the Withlacoochee State Forest to the south, Linden to the west, Center Hill to the north, and Lake County to the east. Transportation and economy The main road through Mabel is State Road 50. Two abandoned railroad lines also run through Mabel. One was the Orange Belt Railway line that spans from Trilby in Pasco County to Sylvan Lake in Seminole County. The other was a Seaboard Air Line Railroad line that spans from Coleman to Auburndale in Polk County. Aside from local farms, the main attraction of Mabel is the northern terminus of the General James A. Van Fleet State Trail, which runs along the former railroad line between Coleman and Auburndale. SR 50 ran over a bridge above the former SAL line, and was kept for a future extension of the trail toward Coleman, aimed primarily at horse riders. The extension was never built, and the bridge was demolished in the early-2010s by the Florida Department of Transportation.SR 50 Mabel Bridge Reconstruction (Central Florida Roads; FDOT) History Mabel began in the late 1800s, receiving a Post Office in 1894. The town was named after the daughter of Postmaster J.P. Phelps. This was a small community of 40-50 people, with a sawmill that made bean hampers (wooden fruit baskets) and other wood products. There was also a packing house called \\"Maybell\\". The sawmill and packing house closed as the residents slowly migrated to nearby Linden. The Post Office closed in 1918 and Mabel has remained a quiet spot on the map ever since.

It was written by co-producer Vali Chandrasekaran and directed by Beth McCarthy Miller. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on April 22, 2010, following shortly after the episode \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" on the same night. Guest stars in this episode include Kapil Bawa and Subhas Ramsaywack. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) distracts himself from his romantic problems by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors (Bawa and Ramsaywack). Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is offended when she learns that her employees hang out outside of work but do not invite her. This episode of 30 Rock closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. \\"Khonani\\" received generally mixed reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 5.182 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.5 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) distracts himself from his romantic problems involving the choice between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school sweetheart Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore) by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors, Subhas (Subhas Ramsaywack) and Khonani (Kapil Bawa). Five years ago, Khonani signed a contract to take the 11:30 p.m. janitorial shift from Subhas and informs Jack that he is ready to start at the new time. Jack grants him permission, and calls a meeting with Subhas informing him that Khonani will take over the 11:30 shift. Subhas is not happy with this, so Jack decides to move him to 10:00 p.m., which Subhas has no problem with. As he begins his scheduled shift, Khonani is unhappy with it as there is no trash to pick up because Subhas has already collected it. Khonani complains to Jack about this, resulting in Jack returning Subhas to 11:30, and Khonani leaving NBC to work at Foxwoods Resort Casino. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is distraught to learn that although her writing staff sometimes hang out after work, they never invite her. She tells Jack‚Äîher boss‚Äîabout this, however, Jack explains that it is best for her to keep her distance from them. Later, Liz's assistant Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) announces that her wedding is back on and that Liz and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) need to plan a bachelorette party for her. Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees‚Äîwho are invited‚Äîthat she can be fun to be with. At the bachelorette party, staff members Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz) show up, but want to leave as they are not having a good time. Liz gets upset about this, calls them out for not inviting her to hang out with them and demands that they apologize to her. At the same time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is torn between his commitments to his pregnant wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) and his desire to party. He asks NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to assist with any of Angie's needs, however, it becomes too much for Kenneth to deal with and he tells Tracy that he needs to be with her instead. Tracy realizes he needs to be with Angie, but changes his mind and goes to a strip club. After returning home and in order to stay there, Tracy decides to wear his dog's shock collar on himself. Tracy then sends Kenneth to take his place at Liz's party. Unbeknownst to Kenneth, Tracy's dog has followed him to the bachelorette party. Kenneth bursts in Liz's home with Tracy's dog right behind him, resulting in the staff hiding from the dog after it attacks them. They all turn to Liz to get rid of the dog, which she at first refuses. She eventually agrees to help them, after they tell her she is a mother figure to them and that nobody wants to go drinking with their mom. Liz finds comfort in this, so she distracts the dog, and the staff exits her apartment unharmed. Production \\"Khonani\\" was written by 30 Rock co- producer Vali Chandrasekaran and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, a long-time television director who worked with series creator Tina Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. This episode was Chandrasekaran's second writing credit, having co-written the \\"Winter Madness\\" episode that aired on January 21, 2010. This was McCarthy-Miller's eleventh directed episode. \\"Khonani\\" originally aired in the United States on April 22, 2010, on NBC as the eighteenth episode of the show's fourth season and the 76th overall episode of the series. The main plot regarding the two janitors‚ÄîSubhas and Khonani‚Äîbattling for the late-night shift at 11:30 p.m. closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien over the hosting job of The Tonight Show. Similar to the feud, in this 30 Rock episode, Khonani signed a contract five years ago to take over the 11:30 p.m. from Subhas and asked Jack Donaghy to make it happen, which Jack does. In September 2004, it was announced by the NBC network that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009 as host of The Tonight Show. Five years later, Leno would host his final episode of The Tonight Show in May 2009; similarly, Jack informs Subhas that Khonani will take over that shift. Subhas is not thrilled with this, resulting in Jack moving Subhas to the 10:00 shift; O'Brien took over as host of The Tonight Show in June 2009. NBC, afraid of losing Leno to another network, gave him a new nightly prime time series, The Jay Leno Show, which premiered in September 2009 at 10:00 p.m. In \\"Khonani\\", as he begins his shift, Khonani is unhappy as there is no trash to pick up as it already has been collected by Subhas. As a result, Subhas goes back to the 11:30 shift, and Khonani leaves NBC to continue his janitorial duties at Foxwoods Resort Casino. The Jay Leno Show debuted to good ratings, however, as the show continued it would garner low ratings, resulting in NBC proposing that the show air at 11:35 p.m. and that The Tonight Show be moved to 12:05. O'Brien, however, rejected the timeslot. In January 2010, O'Brien reached a deal with the network that would see him leave The Tonight Show on January 22, 2010, and two months later Leno returned as host of The Tonight Show on March 1, 2010. In April 2010, O'Brien signed a deal with the cable network TBS to host a new late-night talk show. Lorne Michaels, who is the executive producer of 30 Rock and who used to produce Late Night with Conan O'Brien, was O'Brien's mentor. Michaels told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2010 that O'Brien would \\"prevail\\" from his departure of The Tonight Show. In addition, O'Brien appeared as himself on 30 Rocks first season episode \\"Tracy Does Conan\\" that was broadcast on December 6, 2006. Despite not appearing in the episode, the show made reference of Jack's love triangle storyline with Avery Jessup and Nancy Donovan, played by actresses Elizabeth Banks and Julianne Moore, respectively. This plot was first introduced in the previous episode, \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\". The Jack character's love dilemma would continue throughout the season. Moore was announced as a love interest for Alec Baldwin's television character in November 2009, while Banks' guest spot as a love interest for the Jack character was confirmed in December 2009. 30 Rock executive producer and co-showrunner Robert Carlock was asked in a 2009 interview if Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), Toofer Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J.D. Lutz (John Lutz)‚Äîthe staff writers of the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)‚Äîwere going to be seen more in the upcoming season, to which he replied, \\"One of the great things about this show and the blessing and the curse is that we have so many characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well. [...] And so, yeah, absolutely because we love those guys\\". In this episode, Liz Lemon, the head writer for TGS, discovers that Frank, Toofer, and Lutz, along with Pete, do not invite her to hang out with them as they consider her a mother figure. Cultural references Jack tells Khonani that every April 22 he honors former United States President Richard Nixon's death by getting drunk and making some unpopular decisions, after Khonani demands to start working at the 11:30 shift as he signed a contract with Jack on April 22, 2005. Cerie says that her wedding is back on after learning that her fianc√© was rescued by the A-Team‚Äîa fictional group of ex-United States Army Special Forces who work as soldiers of fortune while being on the run from the military‚Äîfrom pirates. Khonani tells Jack that Subhas will want to leave NBC so he can attend to his hobbies of \\"[collecting] classic car...\\", Khonani coughs, \\"cardboard. Classic cardboard.\\" This is a satirical reference to Jay Leno who collects classic cars. Later, after Jack gives back Subhas his original time shift, Khonani says he has a \\"great job lined up at Fox\\", Khonani coughs, \\"...woods. Foxwoods Casino.\\" Following his departure from NBC, reports circulated that the Fox network wanted to hire Conan O'Brien. At the bachelorette party, Jenna sings the 1840s song \\"Jimmy Crack Corn\\". Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Khonani\\" was watched by 5.182 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It achieved a 2.5 rating/7 share in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was an increase from the previous episode, \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\", that aired the same day of the week, which was watched by 4.216 million American viewers. The episode received generally mixed critical reception. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin found the episode less enjoyable than \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\". He explained that when he first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation \\"I felt a surge of excitement and optimism. I thought the writers would come up with a smart new angle to attack the imbroglio\\", but after the airing he noted the janitor plot only hampered the episode. Rabin, however, enjoyed Tracy's actions in the episode, commenting that it \\"provided a showcase for some great Tracy Morgan non-sequiturs\\". Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly also found \\"Khonani\\" the weaker of the two episodes, and also believed that the \\"late- night jokes felt tired\\". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star- Ledger disliked the episode, and as a result he noted in his recap that he would remove 30 Rock from the rotation of shows for which he always did detailed reviews. Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O'Brien debacle a few months ago \\"this would have been a cutting-edge satire ... Now, not so much.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad remarked that the writing in \\"Khonani\\" was sharp, though added that \\"for some reason\\" the episode \\"didn't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others. I think it was a lot of unfulfilled potential.\\" Sean Gandert of Paste magazine deemed this episode disappointing, but proclaimed \\"it was still entertaining enough.\\" James Poniewozik of Time observed, \\"NBC's public troubles have been 30 Rocks greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from The Jay Leno Show to the Comcast acquisition. The show may not be the best sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely the best work of NBC-criticism.\\" In regards to the main plot, he said it \\"could have done even more with the premise of the Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but it gets a lot of credit for the inspired idea.\\" IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot \\"came at a perfect time\\" in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were \\"less impressive\\". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was \\"supremely clever and self-referential\\", and that the show's take on it was \\"decidedly neutral, albeit very funny\\".

These plateaus are part of the much larger Yellowstone Plateau and dominate areas in the park south and west of the Gallatin and Absaroka mountain ranges. Four of the plateaus are from rhyolite lava flows that occurred between 110,000 and 70,000 years ago. * Blacktail Deer Plateau , ** Traversed by the Mammoth to Tower section of the Grand Loop Road, Blacktail Deer Plateau is one of the most accessible plateaus in the park. Blacktail Deer Plateau takes its name from Blacktail Deer Creek which flows off the plateau. Named by prospectors well before the park's creation in 1872, the name is probably attributable to the then prevalent Blacktail deer of the area. * Buffalo Plateau , ** The Buffalo Plateau straddles the Montana-Wyoming border north of the Lamar Valley and west of Slough Creek in the park's northern range. Named in 1870, before the park's creation, by prospectors Bart Henderson, James Gourley, Adam Miller and Ed Hibbard for the herds of Buffalo prevalent on the plateau. The plateau is traversed by the Buffalo Plateau trail on the west and the Buffalo Fork Trail on the east. * Central Plateau , ** The Central Plateau separates the Hayden Valley and Yellowstone River drainage on the east from the Lower Geyser Basin and the Madison River drainage on the west. * Madison Plateau , ** The Madison Plateau, the largest of the named plateaus, lies south of the Madison River and west of the Upper and Lower Geyser Basins. It extends south from the Madison River to the Continental Divide and west to the park border. The Plateau is virtually inaccessible because only one trail, the Summit Lake Trail, traverses the plateau east to west. The Fairy Creek Trail penetrates the eastern edge of the plateau on its way to Fairy Falls and Little Firehole Meadows. * Mirror Plateau , One of the earliest photographs of Yellowstone occurred during the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 at Mirror Lake on the Mirror Plateau. (Photo by William Henry Jackson, 1871) ** The Mirror Plateau is a remote plateau west of the upper Lamar River and is in the headwaters of Pelican Creek which flows into Yellowstone Lake. The Plateau takes its name from Mirror Lake, originally named Divide Lake because it separates the Lamar and Pelican Creek drainages. During the 1878 Geological Survey, Ferdinand V. Hayden named this lake‚ÄîMirror Lake for its propensity to mirror or reflect the surrounding terrain. * Pitchstone Plateau , ** The Pitchstone Plateau, named after the lava pitchstone occupies the southwest corner of the park in the Bechler and Fall River drainages. The rhyolite lava flows that created the plateau occurred about 70,000 years ago. * Solfatara Plateau , ** Solfatara is a small plateau in the headwaters of the Gibbon River. It lies just west of Canyon and south of Grebe Lake. It was named in 1883 by geologist Walter Weed for a Solfatara, a thermal vent that emits hydrogen sulfide, steam and other gases. The Plateau is bounded by the Norris-Canyon road on the south and Wolf Lake-Cascade Lake trails on the north. The Grebe Lake trail crosses the center of the plateau. * Trident Plateau , ** Trident is a small, remote plateau in the southeast corner of park in the headwaters of the Yellowstone River east of The Trident. It extends east into the Teton National Forest in Wyoming. The Trident was named by geologist Arnold Hague in 1885 because it resembled a three pronged Trident. * Two Ocean Plateau , Gallery See also * Mountains and mountain ranges of Yellowstone National Park Notes Category:Plateaus of the United States Category:Landforms of Yellowstone National Park Category:Volcanic fields of Wyoming Category:Landforms of Wyoming Category:Geology of Wyoming ","title":"Plateaus of Yellowstone National Park"},{"id":"27078249","text":"Nuova Rivista Storica is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Societ√† Editrice Dante Alighieri.

The constitution was adopted on 17 November 1956, and came into effect on 26 January 1957. It was rendered infructuous on 5 August 2019 by an order signed by the president of India and ceased to be applicable on that date. The Constitution of India granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir among Indian states, and it was the only state in India to have a separate constitution. Article 370 of the Constitution of India stated that Parliament of India and the Union government jurisdiction extends over limited matters with respect to State of Jammu and Kashmir, and in all other matters not specifically vested in Federal government, actions have to be supported by state legislature. Also, unlike other states, residual powers were vested with the state government. Because of these constitutional provisions, the State of Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed a special but temporary autonomous status as mentioned in Part XXI of the Constitution of India. Among notable and visible differences with other states, till 1965, the head of state in Jammu and Kashmir was called Sadr-i-Riyasat (Head of State) whereas in other state, the title was Governor, and the head of government was called Prime Minister in place of Chief Minister in other states. On 5 August 2019, the President of India issued a presidential order, namely, The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 (C.O. 272)\\"G.S.R .551(E)\\" under Article 370 making all the provisions of Constitution of India applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir and this has rendered the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir infructuous from that date. Now the Constitution of India is applicable to Jammu and Kashmir, like all other states and union territories of India. Historical aspect India gained its independence from the United Kingdom on midnight of 15 August 1947, and simultaneously Pakistan was created as a new country as a result of the partition of India. Jammu and Kashmir, then a princely state under suzerainty of British Monarch, and ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh who tried to avoid declaring his state's accession to either of the two dominions at the time of independence (although that was not an option under the Indian Independence Act, 1947). Maharaja Hari Singh signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan. However, on 6 October 1947, Pakistani Muslim tribes, supported by the government of Pakistan, attacked Jammu and Kashmir on the behest of Pakistan to achieve forcible accession to Pakistan. Maharaja Hari Singh requested assistance from India, and when India requested an Instrument of Accession to India, the Maharaja signed it so that India could help in defence. The Instrument of Accession (IoA) gave only limited powers to the Government of India, only about the three subject matters of Foreign affairs, Defence and Communications. It was similar to several hundred others IoA signed between the Government of India and other princely states. Whereas the other states later signed merger agreements, the relationship of Jammu and Kashmir with the Union of India was governed by special circumstances. In view of them, the Article 370 was incorporated in the Constitution. The Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir Maharaja (later Sadr-e-Riyasat) Dr. Karan Singh had signed into law in 1957.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Integral-review-of- Article-370-overdue-but-needs-cooperation-not-confrontation-Congress-leader- Karan- Singh/articleshow/35733023.cmshttp://middleeast.about.com/od/pakistan/a/kashmir- history-backgrounder.htm Salient features As of 2002, 29 amendments were made to the Constitution. The Constitution, as of 2002, had 158 articles divided into 13 parts and 7 schedules. The divisions of articles is as follows. The numbers in braces after show the articles included in a particular part. * Part I: Preliminary (1-2) * Part II: The State government(3-5) * Part III: Permanent Residents (6-10) * Part IV: Directive Principles of State Policy (11-25) * Part V: The Executive (26-45) ** The Governor (26-34) ** The Council of Ministers (35-41) ** The Advocate General (42) ** Conduct of Government Business (43-45) * Part VI: The State Legislature (46-92) ** Composition of the State Legislature (46-50) ** General Provisions (51-56) ** Officers of the State Legislature (57-63) ** Conduct of Business (64-67) ** Disqualification of Members (68-71) ** Powers, Privileges and Immunities of the State Legislature and Its members (72-73) ** Legislative Procedure (74-78) ** Procedure In Financial Matters (79-84) ** Procedure Generally (85-90) ** Legislative power of the Governor (91) ** Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery (92) * Part VII The High Court (93-113) ** Subordinate Courts (109-113) * Part VIII: Finance, Property and Contracts (114-123) * Part IX: The Public Services (124-137) ** The Public Service Commission (128-137) * Part X: Elections (138-142) * Part XI: Miscellaneous Provisions (143-146) * Part XII: Amendment of the Constitution (147) * Part XIII: Transmonal Issues (153-158) Articles 148 to 152 have been omitted in Part XIII.

Hurriyat often spread lies on the concept of Permanent Residency and falsely claims that the people of J&K; enjoys dual citizenship. However, the stand of Supreme court is very clear and to put in its words- ‚ÄúWe may also add that permanent residents of Jammu & Kashmir are citizens of India, and there is no dual citizenship as is contemplated by some other federal Constitutions in other parts of the world.‚Äù \\\\--Supreme Court of India. Preamble Preamble to the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir is as quoted below. The preamble resembles almost verbatim to the Preamble to the Constitution of India. Jurisdiction of Parliament Under Part XXI of the Constitution of India, which deals with \\"Temporary, Transitional and Special provisions\\", the State of Jammu and Kashmir was accorded special status under Article 370. Even though included in 1st Schedule as 15th state, all the provisions of the Constitution which are applicable to other states were not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. Government of India can declare emergency in Jammu and Kashmir and impose Governor's rule in certain conditions. Matters related to Defense, Foreign relations, Communication and Finance of Jammu and Kashmir is under jurisdiction of Constitution of India. Union Legislature had very limited jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir in comparison with other states. Till 1963, Parliament could legislate on subjects contained in the Union List, and had no jurisdiction in case of Concurrent List under 7th Schedule with Jammu and Kashmir. The Parliament had no power to legislate Preventive Detention laws for the state; only the state legislature had the power to do so. Emergency provisions The Union of India has no power to declare Financial Emergency under Article 360 in the state. The Union can declare emergency in the state only in case of War or External Aggression. No proclamation of emergency made on the grounds of internal disturbance or imminent danger thereof shall have effect in relation to the state unless (a) it is made at the request or with the concurrence of the government of the state; or (b) where it has not been so made, it is applied subsequently by the President to that state at the request or with the concurrence of the government of that state. In December 1964, Articles 356 and 357 were extended to the state. Fundamental duties, directive principles and fundamental rights Part IV, Article 36-51 (Directive Principles of the State Policy) and Part IVA, Article 51A (Fundamental Duties) of the Constitution are not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. In addition to other fundamental rights, Articles 19(1)(f) and 31(2) of the Constitution are still applicable to Jammu and Kashmir; hence the Fundamental Right to property is still guaranteed in this state. It is the only state which does not have to give a detailed record on the money flowing in the state and where it is used and how. In the Indian Constitutional history only one Fundamental Right has been added so far and that is Right to Education Act. This right too has not been extended to Jammu and Kashmir. Official languages Provisions of Part XVII of the Constitution apply to Jammu and Kashmir only insofar as they relate to (i) the official language of the Union; (ii) the official language for communication between one state and another; or between a state and the Union; and (iii) language of the proceedings in the Supreme Court. Urdu is the official language of the state but use of English is permitted for official purposes unless the state legislature provides otherwise. Relations with Government of India *Article 3 in part 2 of the Jammu and Kashmir constitution stated \\"Relationship of the State with the Union of India:-The State of Jammu and Kashmir is and will be a part of the Union of India. \\" *Article 5 of the part 2 was about extent of \\"Executive\\" and \\"Legislative\\" powers of the state and stated that \\"Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly has executive and legislative power of all matters except those with respect to which Parliament of India has power to make laws for the State under the provisions of the Constitution of India\\". Sectors in which Government of India can make laws for Jammu and Kashmir includes Defense sector, Foreign affairs, Finance and Communication. *Article 147 of Part 12 was about amendment of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution which stated that, \\"No Bill shall be introduced or moved in State Legislative Assembly to amend or change above mentioned articles 3 and 5.\\" =Relations with Pakistan administered Kashmir= *Article 48 of Part VI of Jammu and Kashmir constitution defines Pakistan administered Kashmir as \\"Pakistan Occupied Territory\\" (POK). *There were 111 seats in Jammu and Kashmir state legislative assembly. Of these seats, 24 were reserved for representatives from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, to remain vacant until Pakistan ceases the \\"occupation\\" of Kashmir. Miscellaneous Certain special rights have been granted to the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir with regard to employment under the state, acquisition of immovable property in the state, settlement in the state, and scholarship and other forms of aid as the state government may provide. The 5th Schedule pertaining to the administration and control of Schedule Areas and Scheduled Tribes and the 6th Schedule pertaining to administration of tribal areas are not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Provisions of the State Constitution (except those relating to the relationship of the state with the Union) may be amended by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of the state passed by not less than two-thirds of its membership. If such amendment seeks to affect Governor or Election Commission, it needs the President's assent to come into effect. No amendment of the Constitution of India shall extend to Jammu and Kashmir unless so extended by an order of Jammu and Kashmir President under Article 370(1). No bill or amendment can be introduced or moved in either House of the Legislature which seeks to make any change in the provisions that (a) the State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India (Art. 3) (b) the executive and legislative power of the State does not extend to matters those with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws for the State under the provisions of the Constitution of India (Art. 5), (c) of the Constitution of India as applicable in relation to the State (Art.147 (c) and Art. 147.

Founded around 1666, the Black Eagle Brewery was established on a plot of land next to what is now Brick Lane in London, E1. It grew steadily until the 18th century when, under the management of Benjamin Truman, and driven by the demand for porter, it expanded rapidly and became one of the largest brewers in London. Its growth continued into and through the 19th century with the expansion of its brewery and pub estate. In 1873, it purchased Philips Brewery in Burton and became the largest brewery in the world.Trumans: The Brewers Page 39 The situation changed for Truman's in the 20th century as it had to come to terms with the rise of lager, cheaper competition from imports and the consolidation of the biggest names in British brewing through mergers. Attempts to come to terms with these changes through management restructures and rebranding did not succeed, and in 1989 the brewery was closed. The Truman's brand was revived in 2010 and, since 2013, beer is again being brewed in East London under the Truman's name.  History  = Early years = The original Truman's brew house is generally claimed to have been founded in 1666. However, the historical evidence is not conclusive, with dates ranging from 1663 to 1669.Industries - Brewing  A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2 (pp. 168-178) What is clear is that the name came from Joseph Truman, who having previously worked in the brew house, took control of it in the 1680s.Trumans: The Brewers Page 8 Truman's grew under his stewardship, leading to the purchase of more land around the original site and Truman's becoming a fully-fledged brewery. When he died in 1719, his eldest son, also called Joseph, initially succeeded Joseph Truman. However, within a few years control of Truman's passed to the younger son Benjamin Truman.Trumans: The Brewers Page 9 = Growth years = Truman's flourished under Benjamin Truman, a shrewd businessman blessed with good luck. The latter led to Truman's becoming the drink of the Royal Family. \\"When the Duchess of Brunswick was born in 1737, the Prince of Wales ordered four loads of faggots and a number of tar barrels to be burned before Carlton House to celebrate the event, and directed the Brewery to his household to place four barrels of beer near it for the use of those who chose to partake in the beverage, which certain individuals had no sooner done than they pronounced the liquid of inferior quality. This declaration caused a revolt: the mob threw the beer in each other‚Äôs faces and the barrels into the fire. The Prince had the good nature to order a second bonfire on the succeeding night and procured four barrels of beer from Truman ‚Äòwith which the populace was pleased and satisfied‚Äô\\".Trumans: The Brewers Page 10-11 Up to this point, breweries had always been relatively small operations. That changed with the development of porter, a heavily hopped beer produced from dark brown malts. It reputedly gained its present name when the landlord of the Old Blue Last in Shoreditch, London (a former Truman's pub) requested that his brewer Harwood, supply the beer ready mixed. The landlord then named the beer after his customers, who were mainly market porters.Trumans: The Brewers Page 36 Porter was the first beer that could be mass-produced, leading to the rapid expansion of many London breweries. Benjamin Truman invested heavily to increase brewing capacity, and by 1760 Truman's was the third largest brewer of porter in London.Trumans: The Brewers Page 13 When he died in 1780, Benjamin Truman left no male heir. He left most of the brewery to his grandsons, with the rest going to his head clerk James Grant, who took over the running of the brewery. After Grant's death in 1788, his share was purchased by Sampson Hanbury, who went on to run Truman's for the next 46 years.Trumans: The Brewers Page 19 Hanbury was one of the most important figures in Truman's history, responsible for bringing in new levels of professionalism and efficiency. He purchased the brewery's first steam engine in 1805, greatly increasing Truman's ability to supply the rest of the country. Renowned for demanding high quality raw materials, under his control Truman's expansion continued apace ‚Äì porter production doubled between 1800 and 1820 from 100,000 to 200,000 brewers barrels a year.Trumans: The Brewers Page 21 In 1808, Hanbury's nephew Thomas Fowell Buxton joined the firm and went on to play a big role in Truman's future, as well as leaving his mark on national history. Fresh from a brilliant career at Trinity College, Dublin, the young Buxton was handed control of the ledgers, later taking on responsibility for reorganising the brewery to improve efficiency, which he achieved with great success.Trumans: The Brewers Page 23 Truman's also proved to be a platform for his work as a social reformer: ‚ÄúHe gave much attention to improving the working conditions of his employees. This he did by the simple expedient of employing a school master to teach them and telling his men: ‚ÄòThis day six weeks I shall discharge every man who cannot read and write‚Äô. Not a single man was dismissed‚Äù.Trumans: The Brewers Page 25 Buxton became an MP in 1818, actively working for social reform in many areas of society, most notably working closely with William Wilberforce as one of the chief campaigners for the abolition of slavery. Buxton was also responsible for one of the most famous events in Truman's history, hosting the Cabinet Dinner of 1831, when 23 members of the cabinet including the Lord Chancellor, Henry Brougham, and the Prime Minister, Charles Grey, had dinner at the brewery. ‚ÄúT.F.Buxton had provided a banquet to do justice to such guests, but the Lord Brougham who was always something of an innovator, suggested that the occasion demanded rather steaks and porter. He had his way, and so the meal consisted largely of beef steaks cooked on the furnace of the brewery boiler house.‚ÄùTrumans: The Brewers Page 34 This was also a time when Truman's was doing a lot of exporting, primarily to the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. It was also supplying the East India CompanyTruman‚Äôs Gyle Books ‚Äì London Metropolitan Archives and the British Army. Export beers were usually specifically made, some of which were later deemed suitable for the domestic market, such as the ‚ÄòExport Imperial Stout‚Äô a beer originally brewed for the Russian Court in Saint Petersburg.Trumans: The Brewers Page 35 The opening of the railway in 1839, connected Burton (the source of the best pale ale) to the rest of the country. During the second half of the 19th century, pale ale became more popular than porter. Unable to brew pale ale to the same standard (due to the difference in water properties), Truman's looked to strike an agency agreement with one of the Burton brewers. When these approaches were rejected, Truman's bought Phillips brewery outright in 1873. They hired the nation's most renowned brewery architects and engineers to entirely reconstruct the Burton plan, the acquisition of which had made Truman's the world's largest brewer. The Burton brewery struggled in its first years, but by 1880 it had begun to turn a profit.The History of Beer and Brewing by Ian Hornsey - Page 545 However, the tide was already starting to turn against Truman's. Though sales and assets continued to grow, financing the business was proving increasingly difficult due to the huge sums of money they had tied up in public houses, as well as the restrictive licensing laws of Gladstone. The need to modernise the brewery created further financial strain as the old porter vats had to be dismantled and replaced equipment more suitable for running pale ales.The History of Beer and Brewing by Ian Hornsey - Page 546 In 1888, as part of a bid to raise finance, Truman's became a public limited company.Trumans: The Brewers Page 44 = 20th century = Truman's continued to grow during the first half of the 20th century, increasing its pub estate and buying up suppliers (especially during the war years when supply of raw materials become particularly important to control). It also invested heavily in motorized vehicles to improve distribution, a development lamented by many as it meant the end for Truman's celebrated draymen. However, as the century progressed, Truman's began to struggle in the face of competition from imported lagers, as well as from the trend for mergers amongst British breweries. The 1960s proved to be very turbulent years for the British brewing industry, but Truman's took decisive steps that meant by the end of the decade they were the last major independent brewery left in London. During the 1960s they restructured the entire business, which included closing their Burton brewery, rationalised their pub estate and invested heavily in improving their Brick Lane brewery. The measures had the desired effect as profits grew by a third in the last four years of the decade.The History of Beer and Brewing by Ian Hornsey: Page 549 However, in 1971 Truman's became the centre of a bidding war between Grand Metropolitan and Watney Mann. Eventually, Grand Metropolitan won and then immediately turned its attention to Watney Mann. Upon taking over Watney Mann, Grand Metropolitan then merged it with Truman's.The History of Beer and Brewing by Ian Hornsey: Page 550 Grand Metropolitan made many changes to the company, including changing the name to Truman, creating a new brand, switching to kegs and changing the beer - all decisions that proved to the detriment of the company. These mistakes were realised in the 1980s when casks were brought back along with the traditional Truman's eagle, but the damage had been done and the brewery was shut in 1989. = 21st century revival = In 2010, the Truman's brand was purchased from Scottish & Newcastle by two London businessmen. After several years of planning, with trial brews produced under contract by Everards Brewery in Leicester and Nethergate Brewery in Essex, a new brewery in Hackney Wick was completed in August 2013. The brewery officially opened in September 2013,Historic London brewery reopens and Truman's beer is currently stocked by a number of London pubs.BEER: Truman‚Äôs reborn  Beers  Label for Truman's Eagle Ale The brewery had become successful by brewing porter, and when the popularity of that beer waned in the later part of the 19th century they moved into producing pale ale. In the 20th century they produced brands such as Eagle Ale, Eagle Stout, Light Ale, and Trubrown.  References  ;Bibliography Ian S. Hornsey (2003). History of Beer and Brewing.

Overview profile Foss enjoyed an outstanding career during the final five years of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She won batting titles in back-to-back seasons in 1950 and 1951 and consistently ranked among the top 10 sluggers and best base stealers. Fossie, as friends and fans often called her, was a steady and productive hitter, a solid and speedy outfielder, and a skilled defender at first base. Gifted with a keen eye and a quick swing, she posted a .342 batting average in 498 games, being surpassed only by her younger sister Joanne, who set an all- time record with a .359 mark. Besides scoring 401 runs and driving in another 312 runs, Foss topped the league in doubles three times. She holds the single- season records for hits, doubles and triples, and set also set a record for career doubles (117). She collected 294 stolen bases and is only one of six players to have hit 30 or more career home runs (32). Her career .963 fielding average as an infielder would have been higher except for her rookie season at third base, when she committed 47 errors in 374 chances. Her fielding average at first base and in the outfield never dropped below .964. A two-time All- Star, she won the Rookie of the Year (1950) and Player of the Year (1952) awards, combining with her sister Joanne to capture the final five batting championships of the league. Her playing accomplishments helped her club to make the playoffs in these years and win three straight AAGPBL pennants beginning in 1952.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports Early life A native of Metropolis, Illinois, Betty began playing sandlot ball with her younger sisters at a very early age.

The sisters finally started to play fast-pitch softball on a regular basis. Determined to stay together, the trio played for the Magnavox softball team of the Chicago industrial league before joining the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. In 1950, a Chicago White Sox scout wanted to sign Betty to a minor league contract, but at the same time she received a proposal from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to play for the Fort Wayne Daisies. She opted to stay in the women's league and joined the Fort Wayne team at the start of the 1950 season. The next season, Jean and Joan would join the Daisies' roster.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005; AAGPBL career As a rookie in 1950 Foss had a significant and immediate impact in the league. She won the batting title with a .346 average, and led all hitters with 24 doubles and a robust .471 slugging percentage, 35 points ahead of Sophie Kurys. Foss also finished second with 125 hits (five behind Kurys), tied for third in home runs (five), finished fourth in total bases (162) and runs batted in (61), while tying for sixth in stolen bases (64) and for eighth in runs scored (64). She won the Rookie of the Year honors, but missed the All-Star Team in favor of Fern Shollenberger, an outstanding defender at third base who constantly paced the league in fielding percentage and number of double plays turned. Foss had increased success in her second season. After moving to first base in 1951, she won her second consecutive batting title with a .368 average, to become the first repeat batting champion in the league since Dorothy Kamenshek, who did it both in 1946 and 1947. Foss also led the league with 34 doubles and 176 total bases, and tied for first place in home runs (four) with Eleanor Callow and Alice Pollitt. She also finished fifth in RBI (78), seventh in stolen bases (60) and tied for fourth in runs (77), but again was denied an All-Star spot, this time to Kamenshek, a batting average runner-up in 1950 (.334) and 1951 (.335). Her 34 doubles in a season are the league record. In 1952, Foss received the highest honor of the league when she earned the Player of the Year Award. She led all batters in runs (81), hits (137), doubles (26), triples (17) and RBI (74), and was second in stolen bases (80), while hitting a solid .331 in 106 games to finish second in the batting race behind her sister Joanne (.344). Her 17 triples (more than the next two players combined) is a single-season record. Finally, she gained her first All-Star selection at first base. The All-Star team faced the South Bend Blue Sox, the league‚Äôs 1951 playoff champions. The All-Stars prevailed, 7‚Äì6, when Foss scored the eventual winning run on an RBI-single by Doris Sams in the top of the 9th inning.1952 AAGPBL season. Baseball-Reference.com.

She also led the league in stolen bases (80), in runs (99) for the second consecutive year, and in total bases (195) for the third year in a row. Besides this, she ended third in triples (seven), fifth in RBI (65) and sixth in home runs (five). For the first time in her career, she failed to lead the league in doubles. Foss hit 20 doubles, three behind leader Eleanor Callow. She dropped to a .321 average, while her sister Joanne won the title with a .346 mark. In 1954 Foss hit .352, ending fourth in the batting crown race, while her sister Joanne clinched the title for her third straight season with a .429 average, to become the only player in AAGPBL history to hit .400 or more in a regular season. Foss scored 80 runs, ending second to Joanne (109), and tied for sixth place with 13 doubles. She also finished second in stolen bases (34), fourth in hits (117) and fifth in total bases (172).All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden, McFarland & Company, 2000; The Fort Wayne Daisies advanced to the best-of-five game Championship Series. Previously in the playoffs, the Kalamazoo Lassies dispatched the South Bend Blue Sox in three games and Fort Wayne did the same with the Grand Rapids Chicks. 1954 Championship Title In Game 1 of the AAGPBL Series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies 17‚Äì9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from June Peppas, who also helped herself by hitiing 2-for-4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben, Fern Shollenberger and Chris Ballingall, who hit a grand slam, also slugged one each. Katie Horstman connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause, and her teammate Joanne Weaver slugged one. Pitching star Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18‚Äì7 record with 3.23 ERA during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss. The Daisies evened the Series against the Lassies winning Game 2, 11‚Äì4, after hitting five home runs off two pitchers. Gloria Cordes started for Kalamazoo, but due to a mix-up over the game's starting time the umpires did not allow her to warm up (supposedly there would be a half hour delay). Starting cold, Cordes allowed five runs before getting a batter out. After a leadoff walk to Mary Weddle, Horstman belted a home run for a 2‚Äì0 Fort Wayne lead. Then Ruth Richard and Joanne Weaver hit back-to-back singles, and Betty Foss hit a three-run homer for a 5‚Äì0 edge. Elaine Roth relieved Cordes and completed the game. But the Lassies hit three more home runs, one each by Jean Geissinger and the Foss-Weaver sisters. Kalamazoo discounted the margin with leadoff homers by Nancy Mudge, Peppas (playing at first base) and Dorothy Schroeder, but the game's outcome was never in doubt. In Game 3, the Daisies won the Lassies, 8‚Äì7, fueled again by a heavy hitting by Joanne Weaver, who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at-bats, driving in four runs. Peppas went 1-for-4 to spark a seventh inning three-run rally, but Fort Wayne came back in the bottom of the inning with two runs that marked the difference. Cordes relieved with the bases loaded in the seventh inning but did not allow any damage for the remainder of the game. In other close scores, the Lassies evened the Series in Game 4 with a victory over the Daisies, 6‚Äì5. Cordes started again with her team against the wall, 2-to-1. This time properly warmed up, she hurled a complete game, allowing five runs on nine hits. Habben drove in two runs who marked the difference, while Kline suffered her second loss of the Series. Peppas contributed with a single, a double and one RBI in four at-bats. In decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3-for-5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by an 8‚Äì5 margin to give the Lassies the Championship title in the AAGPBL's last ever game. She received support from Balingall (3-for-4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run in the bottom of the eight. Peppas finished with a .450 average and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in the league's history. In the end, the inspired Lassies rose to the challenge and batted a .337 average as a team. On the other hand, the usually heavy-hitting Daisies averaged only .275.1954 AAGPBL Championship Title.

Bill Allington All-Stars Once the league disbanded, Foss joined several other players selected by former Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans All-Stars. The team played 100 games, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Foss, the Allington All-Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Magdalen Redman, Ruth Richard, Dorothy Schroeder, Jean Smith, Dolly Vanderlip, and her younger sister, Joanne, among others.Women in Baseball: The Forgotten History ‚Äì Gai Ingham Berlage, Charley Gerard.

In 1952 and 1953, the Daisies were knocked out in the first round after posting the best regular-season record.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book =Players Association= When the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was unable to continue in 1955, its history and its significance were soon forgotten. Many people in the 1950s thought that women were not supposed to play baseball, so most female athletes competed in other fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project to get in touch with friends, teammates, and opponents, that resulted in the league‚Äôs first-ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years later and many former players of the defunct league continued to enjoy reunions. =Hall of Fame honors= The AAGPBL Players Association movement helped to bring the league story to the public eye. The association was largely responsible for the opening of a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York since November 5, 1988, that honors those who were part of this unique experience. =A League of Their Own= The 1992 film A League of Their Own is about the first season of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her film includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story. A League of Their Own itself was inspired by the 1987 documentary of the same title, written and produced by Kelly Candaele, one of the five sons of the aforementioned Helen Callaghan. Candaele also collaborated with Kim Wilson in the story for the film. The AAGPBL players were relatively unknown until the Marshall's film was exhibited for the first time. In the AAGPBL Players Association annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL players singing We're the members of the All-American League. We come from cities near and far.

In 1846 it was extended to Magdeburg. History =The first railway in Prussia = The Prussian Royal residence was located at Potsdam approximately 25 km west of Berlin, which at the beginning of the 19th century already had more than 200,000 inhabitants. Although railways were already being built in England, the sceptical attitude of the King Friedrich Wilhelm III delayed the establishment of a railway in Prussia. After the opening of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway showed that railways could be operated economically in Germany, it was decided to establish a railway in Prussia. The Prussian Railway Act of 3 November 1838 established the basis for operating private railway companies and also provided for the Prussian state to take them over after 30 years. The Berlin-Potsdam Railway opened the first section of its line in autumn 1838 (the section between Potsdam and Zehlendorf on 22 September and the main line to Berlin on 29 October). The Potsdamer Bahnhof opened in 1838 just outside the outside Potsdamer Tor (a gate in Berlin's tax wall). In 1837, the Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam Railway Company acquired land for the station from the Unity of the Brethren in Berlin and Rixdorf for 12,400 thalers. Its Potsdam station was southeast of the city on the other bank of the Havel river, where it also established a rail workshop. The first railway stations between Berlin and Potsdam were Zehlendorf (established in 1838), Sch√∂neberg (1839) and Steglitz (1839). The Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway Company  Crash of the locomotive Jupiter into the Havel, 1855 The Havel bridge in Potsdam in 1871 The Herrenkrug bridge over the Elbe River in Magdeburg The Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway Company (German: Potsdam-Magdeburger Eisenbahngesellschaft) was founded 1845, receiving royal assent on 17 August 1845. It extended the Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam line to Magdeburg and was later merged with the Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam Railway to create the Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìMagdeburg Railway Company (German: Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburger Eisenbahngesellschaft). Although the Potsdam station was directly connected with central Potsdam by the Long Bridge (German: Lange Br√ºcke), the extension of the railway towards Brandenburg over the Havel and on to Magdeburg was very difficult. Directly west of the Potsdam station the line had to cross the Havel and Neust√§dter Bay, requiring several bridges. In the same section it had to cross the Potsdamer Stadtkanal (Potsdam City Canal, located in the modern Dortustra√üe), requiring another bridge. The track in this whole section was laid on an embankment. The line from Potsdam Kiewitt (west of Neust√§dter Bay) to Magdeburg was opened on 7 August 1846, but the Havel crossing was not opened until 12 September 1846, completing the line from Berlin to Magdeburg. The line had to cross the Havel again near Werder to connect to Werder station on the shore. In order to reach the Elbe station from Magdeburg-Buckau the railway had to cross the Old Elbe, the Taube Elbe, the main Elbe rivers and the island between them containing the district of Werder. Until the completion of the main bridge over the Elbe, the Buckau Railway Bridge, a vertical lift bridge, in 1848 trains terminated at Magdeburg-Friedrichstadt station. By 1847, the trunk line had been largely converted to double track. 1870, the Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìMagdeburg Railway Company, together with the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company and the Magdeburg- Leipzig Railway Company bought a 55 hectare site for the construction of Magdeburg central station. The Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìMagdeburger railway built its station at the western end of the station complex. It built a new line between Burg and Magdeburg, crossing the ridge of the Hohen Fl√§ming in Moser and the Herrenkrug Railway Bridge and abandoning the old line from Burg via Niegripp, Hohenwarthe, Lostau and Gerwisch. On 1 June 1874, a branch from Zehlendorf, the Wannsee Railway (later known as the Old Wannsee line) with stations at Schlachtensee and Wannsee was opened. In the same year, stations at Friedenau, Lichterfelde and Griebnitzsee were opened for local services. =Nationalisation and upgrading from 1883 = Memorial to the 22 December 1939 crash On 1 October 1891, the New Wannsee line open from Zehlendorf to Berlin parallel with the trunk line. It served suburban traffic while long- distance trains ran on the trunk line to Magdeburg. Following the opening of the Brandenburg City Railway in 1904 Brandenburg developed as an important railway junction. In particular, a steel works was built there in 1913, providing the line with a high volume of freight. In 1928 the Berlin S-Bahn was extended from Wannsee to Potsdam. On 15 May 1933, the long-distance trunk line between Berlin and Zehlendorf was also electrified. This allowed the so- called \\"banker trains \\" of the S-Bahn from the Wannsee line to change at Zehlendorf to the trunk line and then run without stopping until Potsdam station. In addition electric railcars operating on the long-distance lines continued as steam hauled suburban trains along the direct route to Potsdam without going through Wannsee. D√ºppel station was opened in 1939 for local traffic. On 22 December 1939 the worst railway accident in German history occurred at Genthin station, with 278 people killed and another 453 people seriously injured. The night express D 180 (Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìNeunkirchen (Saar) ran at high speed, ignoring several signals, into an overcrowded D 10 express from Berlin to Cologne. Visibility that night was very poor due to heavy drizzle and fog, so the D 180 train ran through a signal at danger at Belicke and ran into the D 10 at 100 to 110 km/h. The contemporary news media understated the death toll and gave only limited coverage of the accident. The war-damaged Potsdam station closed in 1945 and the southern section of the S-Bahn was closed in 1945/1946 and never reopened. =Postwar = The badly damaged Herrenkrug bridge in Magdeburg was temporarily repaired and put back into operation on 12 March 1946. In order to supply reparations to the Soviet Union the second track was removed from sections of the line until 1948. =The section in West Berlin = Zehlendorf In April 1945, the railway bridge over the Teltow Canal was blown up and later the track between Griebnitzsee and D√ºppel was singled to provide reparations. As of 1 December 1945, therefore, only shuttles ran between D√ºppel and Zehlendorf. As of 15 June 1948 this section was electrified, to reduce the significant costs of steam operations. The line was affected by the boycott of the S-Bahn by potential passengers from West Berlin after the building of the Berlin Wall and the establishment of parallel bus routes. Trains often ran without a single passenger, although a driver and ticket collector were still required. Nevertheless, on 20 December 1972, the East Germany Railways established the new station of Zehlendorf S√ºd between Zehlendorf and D√ºppel near a new residential area in an attempt to increase passenger numbers. After the West Berlin railway employees strike in late summer 1980, S-Bahn operations were closed on18 September 1980 on the Zehlendorf‚ÄìD√ºppel section. The platform equipment were gradually dismantled and used elsewhere and the buildings collapsed over the years. =The Potsdam‚ÄìMagdeburg main line in the German Democratic Republic= In 1952 border controls were installed in the formerly suburban station of Griebnitzsee. Due to the dismantling of the second track the capacity of the main line was greatly reduced. The opening of the Berlin outer ring in 1957 long-distance trains between Berlin and Werder (Havel) shifted to the new route to Berlin, with a new Potsdam Hauptbahnhof (now Potsdam Pirschheide) taking over the functions of the former Potsdam station, which was now served only by local trains. After the establishment of the Berlin Wall the Griebnitzsee border control station on the main railway was expanded for transit between East and West Berlin, with substantial changes to track work. The restoration of the second track between Magdeburg and Werder was completed in 1976. In 1983 the second track was restored to the section between Werder and Berlin-Wannsee. =Developments since 1989 = New rail bridge over Neust√§dter Havelbucht in Potsdam With the completion of the electrification of the Griebnitzsee‚ÄìBrandenburg an der Havel‚ÄìBiederitz section in December 1995, Intercity-Express trains could now take the direct route via Brandenburg instead of the now partially closed route through Bad Belzig and G√ºtergl√ºck (the strategic railway known as the Kanonenbahn, the \\"Cannons Railway\\"). At the same time the line was upgraded for a top speed of 160 km/h. The bridges over the Havel and Neust√§dter Bay in Potsdam had to be replaced, one of them with a new 57-metre tied-arch bridge, completed on 10 May 1995. The other bridge, a 90-year-old steel truss bridge had already been replaced. After the opening of the Hanover‚ÄìBerlin high-speed line in September 1998, long-distance traffic shifted to that route and the number of trains on the line through Brandenburg and Magdeburg fell heavily. After the Potsdam station was bombed and badly damaged in 1945 a minor building temporarily served as the main station building. Due to the reduced importance of the station during the Communist period the temporary station was able to handle the load. In 1999 the new Potsdam Hauptbahnhof was opened with three platforms (one for the Berlin S-Bahn) and a variety of shops. In the course of the work the former Potsdam freight yard was demolished. The long-distance service remaining now is a single daily Intercity train pair on the Cottbus‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìMagdeburg‚ÄìHannover‚ÄìNorddeich Mole route. Significant secondary and branch lines  =Goerz Railway = Branching off from Lichterfelde West station a rail connection was opened in 1905, to the Sch√∂now district on theTeltow Canal and the industrial area on the canal. The operation on the Zehlendorf railway was originally carried out with horse- drawn carriages. From 1908 it began to use a fireless locomotive. During World War I it used its first steam locomotive to serve the Goerz film supply factory. On the Goerz Railway passenger were also carried until this service was closed during World War II. The route currently serves as a branch line for freight, including automotive parts bound for the Ford factory in Cologne. =Relief line = From about 1900 there was a great need to relieve the railway lines in Berlin from an increase in freight traffic. The establishment of a bypass line around Berlin was also considered of strategic importance. Starting from J√ºterbog on line runs via Seddin to Potsdam Wildpark station where the line joins the Berlin‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìMagdeburg Railway. A few kilometres further west, the route branches off in a northerly direction through Golm to Wustermark and Kremmen. Since 1957 the northern part has been part of the Berlin outer ring and carried heavy traffic, especially freight trains. Also Regionalbahn (local) line RB 21 runs between Griebnitzsee and Wustermark hourly. Every two hours local trains run between Potsdam and Hennigsdorf. The southern part is currently served by local trains on line RB 22 hourly. Freight trains generally use the Berlin outer ring. =Berlin outer ring = The 30 September 1956, the final section of the Berlin outer ring (German: Berliner Au√üenring, BAR) was completed, formng a ring around West Berlin. This extended the existing outer freight ring (G√ºterau√üenring, GAR) by adding a new section between Werder and Saarmund crossing the Templiner See. During the Communist period, the Berlin outer ring was of considerable importance for the long-distance and freight traffic. Almost all long-distance trains, except trains running between West Germany and West Berlin via Griebnitzsee branched off the main Magdeburg‚ÄìBrandenburg‚ÄìPotsdam line in Werder on to the outer ring in order to bypass West Berlin to the south to reach East Berlin. The line was one of the busiest routes in the East German Railway network. Regional services were provided by the so-called Sputnik trains every hour between Werder and Berlin-Karlhorst. Some of these trains connected to Brandenburg an der Havel. The opening of the Potsdam Hauptbahnhof (now Potsdam Pirschheide Station) in 1956 and the establishment of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 meant that the Potsdam city station (now Potsdam Hauptbahnhof) lost most of its passengers. Only a limited service ran between Werder and Potsdam Babelsberg, and a few trains ran to J√ºterbog. With the opening of the border in 1989 and the renovation of the Berlin Stadtbahn in 1997 traffic flows changed substantially and by the BAR platforms on the upper part of Pirschheide station are now no longer served by passenger trains. The BAR is still heavily used by freight trains, both serving the Seddin marshalling yard (south of Potsdam) and for trains between western Germany and Poland. = Lehnin Light Railway = Between October 1899 and December 1965 (passenger) and October 1967 (freight), trains ran from Gro√ü Kreutzstation on the 12 km long light railway to Lehnin via Nahmitz. =The Brandenburg Towns Railway and the steel works in Brandenburg an der Havel = Significant volumes of freight formerly ran over the originally private Brandenburg Towns Railways (Brandenburgische St√§dtebahn) to and from Brandenburg, which in turn connected near Brandenburg station to a formerly extensive network of sidings to the Philipp Weber iron and steel works and the city's port. =Light railways in Genthin and G√ºsen = Several branch lines were built from the railway stations of Genthin and G√ºsen there were that the Jerichower Land. From Genthin lines branched to Sandau via Jerichow; from G√ºsen lines branched to Ziesar and Jerichow. All of these branch lines were nationalised in 1949. They are all now closed for passenger traffic and except for short sections for freight traffic. = Burg bei Magdeburg = In Burg bei Magdeburg, the Tack and Co shoe factory was established in 1883, which by the Second World War was the largest shoe manufacturer in Europe. This meant that large quantities of cattle were required for the local slaughterhouse, which was opened in 1899. Projects  =The planned reconstruction of the trunk line = After reunification there were initially plans to reopen the disused section of the trunk line between Berlin and Potsdam. As part of the construction of the new North‚Äìsouth main line for long-distance and regional trains, the tunnel under the Tiergarten includes structures allowing a connection at a later stage to the trunk line. This project is not considered to be economically justified, and will not be realized. The entire trunk line between the Gleisdreieck area and Zehlendorf station would have to be rebuilt. The route would have to be widened to fit in a double track line at the spacings now required. Furthermore, many of the road bridges would have to be rebuilt to allow sufficient vertical clearances for electric operation. Other railway bridges would also need to be renewed to overcome aging or inadequate clearances. The section between the Zehlendorf and D√ºppel stations would have to be rebuilt. In addition, there is limited potential additional traffic, with long-distance traffic now mostly transferred to the Hanover‚ÄìBerlin high-speed line and regional traffic able to use the route via Wannsee to the Berlin Stadtbahn.

History In 1802, George III of the United Kingdom, who was also the prince-elector of Hanover, allocated 22,680 thalers for a new observatory. The plans were developed, like many of the university's buildings, by Georg Heinrich Borheck. Construction was delayed by the French Revolutionary Wars and extended from 1803 until 1816. At the time, the building was on the outskirts of G√∂ttingen, to ensure an unobstructed view of the night sky. Carl Friedrich Gauss became the first director of the Observatory, and lived there between 1815 and 1855. Gauss arranged for the installation of two meridian circles (produced by Johann Georg Repsold and Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach in 1818 and 1819. Gauss was succeeded by Wilhelm Weber and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, who served as provisional directors (though neither was an astronomer), and Dirichlet was replaced, upon his death, by Gauss's former assistant, Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm Klinkerfues. In 1868, the research institution was divided into theoretical and practical sections. Klinkerfues continued to run the observatory until his death in 1884, after which directorship passed on to Wilhelm Schur in 1886. Throughout 1887/1888 Schur led a complete redevelopment of the observatory. Major projects included the renewal of the main hall's roof and the replacement of the outdated dome. In contrast to his predecessor, Klinkerfues, Schur was very successful in modernizing the inadequate equipment of the observatory, acquiring a new, large Repsold heliometer in 1888. He also, with the help of an assistant, catalogued and organised over 11,000 books and brochures in the observatory's library over a period of a year and a half, finishing in 1899. Following Schur's death, Karl Schwarzschild assumed the position in 1901 and was succeeded first by Johannes Franz Hartmann and then by Hans Kienle, Paul ten Bruggencate, Hans-Heinrich Voigt, Rudolf Kippenhahn, Klaus Fricke, Klaus Beuermann, and finally Stefan Dreizler. =Outposts= To improve observations, a new observatory was planned on the Hainberg, a small hill south east of G√∂ttingen. After the opening of a new observatory there in 1929, the instruments were transferred from G√∂ttingen to this new location. Due to the construction of a new telescope at Hainberg, observations at G√∂ttingen Observatory were halted in 1933. In 1941, during World War II, Paul ten Bruggencate became the director of the G√∂ttingen University Observatory. In pursuit of his interest in observing the Sun, he looked for a new solar telescope. With the help of the military, he was able to build a solar telescope near the already existing telescope at Hainberg. Unsatisfied with the cloudy weather conditions in Germany, ten Bruggencate established another solar observatory in Switzerland: the Locarno Observatory was planned and built in the late 1950s. It was closed in 1984 and the equipment was transferred to the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain, where the University of G√∂ttingen now shares the operation of several solar telescopes. =Further use= The institute was later directed by Hans-Heinrich Voigt, Rudolf Kippenhahn, Klaus Fricke, Klaus Beuermann and finally, by Stefan Dreizler. After renovations, most recently in 2008, the observatory building was restored to its original appearance. Since 2009, the Observatory has housed the Lichtenberg-Kolleg Institute for Advanced Study.http://www.uni- goettingen.de/en/observatory/91323.html See also *Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer *Hans-Heinrich Voigt References Category:Astronomical observatories in Germany Category:1816 establishments in the Kingdom of Hanover Category:1984 disestablishments in Germany Category:University of G√∂ttingen Category:Buildings and structures in G√∂ttingen (district) ","title":"G√∂ttingen Observatory"},{"id":"27078548","text":"The Titanic Museum is a two-story museum shaped like the RMS Titanic.

Campbell Morgan in 1907 Morgan in later years Reverend Doctor George Campbell Morgan D.D. (9 December 1863 - 16 May 1945) was a British evangelist, preacher, a leading Bible teacher, and a prolific author. A contemporary of Rodney \\"Gipsy\\" Smith, Morgan preached his first sermon at age 13. He was the pastor of Westminster Chapel in London from 1904 to 1919, pausing for 14 years to teach at Biola in Los Angeles, and returning to the Chapel from 1933 to 1943 when he handed over the pastorate to the renowned Martyn Lloyd-Jones, after having shared it with him and mentored him for some years previous. From 1911-1914 he was the president of Cheshunt College, Cambridge. Biography Morgan was born on a farm in Tetbury, England, the son of Welshman George Morgan and Elizabeth Fawn Brittan. His father was a member of the strict Plymouth Brethren but resigned and became a Baptist minister. He was very sickly as a child, could not attend school, and so was tutored at home. When Campbell was 10 years old, D. L. Moody came to England for the first time. His ministry, combined with the dedication of his parents, made such an impression on young Morgan that at the age of 13 he preached his first sermon. Two years later he was preaching regularly in country chapels during his Sundays and holidays. By 1883 he was teaching in Birmingham. However, in 1886, at the age of 23, he left the teaching profession and devoted himself to preaching and Bible exposition. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry in 1890. He had no formal training for the ministry, but his devotion to studying the Bible made him one of the leading Bible teachers of his day. His reputation as preacher and Bible expositor grew throughout Britain and spread to the United States. In 1896 Moody invited him to lecture to the students at the Moody Bible Institute. This was the first of 54 visits to America to preach and teach. After the death of Moody in 1899 Morgan assumed the position of director of the Northfield Bible Conference. He was given a Doctor of Divinity degree by the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1902. After five successful years in this capacity, he returned to England in 1904 and became pastor of Westminster Chapel in London. During two years of this ministry he was President of Cheshunt College in Cambridge. His preaching and weekly Friday night Bible classes were attended by thousands. In 1910 Morgan contributed an essay entitled The Purposes of the Incarnation to the first volume of The Fundamentals, 90 essays which are widely considered to be the foundation of the modern Fundamentalist movement. Leaving Westminster Chapel in 1919, he once again returned to the United States, where he conducted an itinerant preaching and teaching ministry for 14 years. He returned to England in 1933, where he again became pastor of Westminster Chapel and remained there until his retirement in 1943. He was instrumental in bringing Martyn Lloyd-Jones to Westminster in 1939 to share the pulpit and become his successor. Morgan was a friend of F. B. Meyer, Charles Spurgeon, and many other great preachers of his day. Morgan died on 16 May 1945, at the age of 81. Replacement Theology For most of his life Campbell Morgan taught the dispensational view on Israel and the Jews, but towards the end of his life he changed his views to Replacement Theology. He wrote this in a letter in 1943: \\"I am quite convinced that all the promises made to Israel are found, are finding and will find their perfect fulfillment in the church. It is true that in time past, in my expositions, I gave a definite place to Israel in the purposes of God. I have now come to the conviction, as I have just said, that it is the new and spiritual Israel that is intended.\\" (Letter to Rev. H. F. Wright, New Brunswick, Victoria.  Publications  Morgan was a prolific author, writing about 80 works in his lifetime. This number does not include the 10-volume set of sermons, \\"The Westminster Pulpit,\\" as well as sermons that were published independently as booklets and pamphlets, nor the posthumous works. He wrote commentaries on the entire Bible, and on many devotional topics related to the Christian life and ministry. His essay entitled \\"The Purposes of the Incarnation\\" was included in a famous and historic collection called The Fundamentals, a set of 90 essays edited by the famous R. A. Torrey, who himself was successor to D. L. Moody both as an evangelist and pastor. The Fundamentals is widely considered to be the foundation of the modern Fundamentalist movement.

They are also known as the Seven Strong Men Rock Formations and the Poles of the Komi Republic. The height of the rocks varies between 30 and 42 metres. About 200 million years ago at the location of the stone pillars there were high mountains. Rain, snow, wind, frost and heat gradually eroded the mountains. Solid sericite-quartzite schists, from which the remains are composed, were eroded less and survive today. Soft rocks were destroyed by weathering and carried by water and wind into depressions. One pillar, 34 meters high, stands somewhat apart from the others. It resembles an inverted bottle. Six others lie at the edge of the cliff.

Many operate in packs and have become accustomed to seeking food from passersby. Some of them who frequent or inhabit the subway have attracted international attention for learning how to use the trains to commute between various locations.  Background  The issue of Moscow's stray dogs was first mentioned by Russian writers such as journalist Vladimir Gilyarovsky in the late 19th century. Their sad lot was dramatised by Anton Chekhov in the famous short story Kashtanka, by Mikhail Bulgakov in the novella Heart of a Dog, and by Gavriil Troyepolsky in the novel White Bim Black Ear. As of March 2010, there were an estimated 35,000 free-ranging dogs living within Moscow's city limits, or approximately one dog for every 300 people, and about 32 per square km (84 per square mile). According to Andrei Poyarkov of the A.N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution, a biologist and wolf expert who has studied Moscow's dogs for over 30 years, the quantity of food available to them keeps the total population of homeless dogs steady at between 35,000 and 50,000. Most pups don‚Äôt reach adulthood, and those that do essentially replace adults who have died. A life of more than 10 years is considered rare. Many, if not most, street dogs share certain physical similarities: medium-sized with thick fur, wedge-shaped heads and almond eyes, with long tails and erect ears. Most dogs are born homeless; others arrive on the streets as rejected or abandoned house pets. Poyarkov estimates that fewer than 3 percent of abandoned pet dogs live long enough to breed. Over the years that Poyarkov observed the dogs, he noticed that the population has lost such features as spotted coats, wagging tails, and friendliness, characteristics known to distinguish dogs from wolves. When the number of street dogs massively increased in the nineties and they began to bite humans, the dogs were hunted and killed. In recent years the attitude and strategy towards street dogs has changed. The dogs are caught and neutered, and are given enough to eat. The dogs keep the city free of food leftovers and rats. Stray dogs in Moscow have adapted their behavior to the traffic and life of Moscow. The dogs ride the Metro and understand the rules of traffic lights. The stray dogs of Moscow are often called Moscow's Metro dogs.  Types of street dogs  Poyarkov classified their evolving social structures into four groups: * Wild dogs (feral and nocturnal, avoiding humans and viewing them as a threat) * Foragers (semi-feral) * Beggars (the most socialized to people, but not affectionate or personally attached) * Guard dogs (who view certain humans as their leaders. Commonly met at mills or construction yards, may be fed on regular basis yet have no official owner). A dog asleep aboard the Moscow Metro = Beggars' techniques = The urbanized beggars in particular are unfazed by high levels of activity going on around them, even managing to sleep in the midst of busy areas. They also have the most specialized behaviors, which differentiate them from both domesticated dogs and wolves. Beggars may live in packs, but a pack's leader will interact with other packs. The leaders are not necessarily the strongest or most dominant dog, but rather the most intelligent, and are acknowledged as such by the other dogs in the pack who depend on them for survival. One technique some dogs have for getting food is to sneak up behind a person who is holding some. The dog will then bark, which sometimes startles the human enough to drop the food. The dogs have learned to cross the street with pedestrians and have been observed obeying traffic lights. Since dogs have dichromatic vision, researchers theorize that the dogs recognize other cues, such as the shapes or positions of the changing signals. The dogs have become adept at intuiting the psychology of individual humans in order to determine which techniques will work best on whom. Dogs who locate themselves in high traffic areas realize that, in such places, they often won't need to make any effort to procure food, as pedestrians will simply toss it as they pass by. Malnourished-looking dogs are uncommon. Food is often easy to come by, allowing dogs the luxury of being selective. The reduced need to compete for food has contributed to stable social behavior, although incidents in which humans were harmed by packs of dogs have been known to occur, particularly in less urban areas. According to Alexei Vereshchagin, a graduate student of Poyarkov's who has studied them, the dogs generally go out of their way to avoid conflict with humans, and rarely defecate in busy areas or onto pavements. Among the general human population, the dogs are simultaneously viewed affectionately and as a problem, but moreover they are generally tolerated. Many people choose to feed them and some people will even build basic shelters for them in the winter. They have come to be considered by many a component of the city's character. Sterilization efforts have had little effect on curtailing the population.  Subway-dwelling dogs  The Moscow Metro is the second most heavily used in the world by daily ridership, behind the Beijing Subway. On average, about 500 dogs live in its stations, especially during colder months. Of these dogs, about 20 are believed to have learned how to use the system as a means of commuting. Theories to explain how they are able to correctly determine their routes include a combination of: * an ability to judge the length of time spent on the train in between stations (time intervals) * recognition of the place names announced over their train's loudspeaker * the scents of particular stations. Compassion monument on a 2019 postage stamp of Russia Author Eugene Linden, a specialist in the subject of animal intelligence, believes the dogs' behavior exhibits \\"flexible open-ended reasoning and conscious thought\\". There are also instances when these metro dogs gave birth to pups during their commuting time. = Malchik = In 2001, a woman mortally stabbed a dog named Malchik, a black feral dog who had made Mendeleyevskaya station his home, guarding it against other dogs and drunks, because he had barked at her dog. The incident, which occurred in front of rush-hour commuters, provoked outrage among celebrities and the general public. The woman was arrested, tried and underwent a year of psychiatric treatment. Funds were raised to erect a bronze statue of Malchik in memoriam, which now sits at the station's entrance.  Dog attack rates  One effect of the large feral population is a high and rising level of dog attacks on humans. In 2007 official statistics suggest that 20,000 attacks took place, of which 8,000 were sufficiently serious to require police or medical intervention and at least one being fatal. In part, the problem is traced to status dogs that are abandoned when they become troublesome, and in part due to those dogs living in forested areas that are poorly socialized and more prone to aggressive territorialism.

The Dumas method is appropriate to determine the molecular weights of volatile organic substances that are liquids at room temperature. The method was designed by a French chemist named Jean Baptiste Andr√© Dumas, after whom the procedure is now named. Dumas used the method to determine the vapour densities of elements (mercury, phosphorus, sulfur) and inorganic compounds. Today, modern methods such as mass spectrometry and elemental analysis are used to determine the molecular weight of a substance. Determination The procedure entailed placing a small quantity of the unknown substance into a tared vessel of known volume. The vessel is then heated in a boiling water bath; all the air within the flask would be expelled, replaced by the vapor of the unknown substance. When no remaining liquid can be observed, the vessel may be sealed (e.g. with a flame), dried, and weighed. By subtracting the tare of the vessel, the actual mass of the unknown vapor within the vessel can be calculated. Assuming the unknown compound obeyed the ideal gas equation, the number of moles of the unknown compound, n, can be determined by :pV=nRT\\\\, where the pressure, p, is the atmospheric pressure, V is the measured volume of the vessel, T is the absolute temperature of the boiling water bath, and R is the ideal gas constant. By dividing the mass in grams of the vapor within the vessel by the calculated number of moles, the molecular weight may be obtained. Assumptions Two major assumptions are used in this method: # The compound vapor behaves ideally # Either the volume of the vessel does not vary significantly between room and the working temperature, or the volume of the vessel may be accurately determined at the working temperature See also * Victor Meyer Method * Cryoscopy and ebullioscopy, two other methods for the determination of molecular weights References Further reading External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20091229043650/http://chemlabs.uoregon.edu/Classes/Exton/CH228/Dumas.pdf * https://web.archive.org/web/20100820010803/http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/chem1102/molwt.htm Category:Molecular physics ","title":"Dumas method of molecular weight determination"},{"id":"27078864","text":"Jos√© Mar√≠a Valverde in 1980 Jos√© Mar√≠a Valverde Pacheco (26 January 1926, Valencia de Alc√°ntara (C√°ceres) ‚Äì 6 June 1996, Barcelona) was a Spanish poet, essayist, literary critic, philosophy historian, and Spanish translator. Biography Valverde was born in Extremadura, but spent his childhood and teenage years in Madrid. While still a student at the Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu he published his first book, Man of God: Psalms, elegies and prayers, which was funded by the Institute. Although Damaso Alonso tempted him to study philology, Valverde pursued Philosophy; his doctorate included a thesis on Wilhelm von Humboldt's philosophy of language. That same year he married Pilar Gefaell, with whom he had five children, including Mariana Valverde, a Professor of Criminology at the University of Toronto. He wrote in various magazines: La Estafeta Literaria, Escorial, Works and Days, Root, and the Ensign and Journal of Aesthetic Ideas, at times using the pseudonym \\"Gambrinus\\". His essays were later collected in The Art of the Article (1949‚Äì1993) (Barcelona, 1994). He also published in poetic magazines including Garcilaso, Espada√±a, Proel. Between 1950 and 1955, Valverde lived in Rome, where he was reader of Spanish at Sapienza University of Rome and at the Spanish Institute, and met Benedetto Croce. At age 29 in 1956, he obtained the chair of Aesthetics at the University of Barcelona. This setting and his experiences as a professor inspired \\"The conquest of the world\\" (1960). He participated in the literary magazines of the time and in numerous periodicals, which published much of his thinking. He himself said he was a poet rather than a philosopher, and not vice versa. He was devoted to the study of history of ideas. Collaborating with Mart√≠ de Riquer i Morera in an ambitious History of literature (1957, greatly expanded later) and writing a Life and death of ideas: small stories thoughts (1981), he launched his award- winning translations of classics of literature in English and German. With a clear social and political commitment, Christian and anti-Francoist, he supported the popular cause in Central America (Cuba, the Sandinistas: relating to exiled Nicaraguan poets Julio Ycaza, Luis Rocha and Fernando Silva.) For political reasons (solidarity with teachers Enrique Tierno Galv√°n, Jos√© Luis Aranguren and Agustin Garcia Calvo who were expelled from the University of Madrid by Franco), he resigned his professorship in 1964 and went into exile. He is credited with the now famous phrase, written on the blackboard in farewell: \\"Nulla aesthetica sine ethica. Ergo apaga y v√°monos.\\" He went to the United States, where he was professor of Hispanic and comparative literature (University of Virginia, McMaster) and then to Canada where he was a professor of Spanish literature at Trent University. This experience is part of his poem \\"The Tower of Babel falls on the poet\\": \\"Mature in age and poetry you moved to a foreign speaking country, and it is not living. What they say here, ia easy as breathing, easy, rich, accurate, you're trying to mimic them with effort, and hear your voice, ridiculous and strange, fail as a child always right here, end up saying something not yours. Now I am alien to the landscape: do not talk to you: to the bird and the tree and the river spared you the legends wrap their names here-in you tags. In vain you smile to others polite, and even friends, cheering from the language in which they are the masters: fails to love them: you forget: the depths of your spirit does not beat does not live in the language that is your history.\\" (Ser de palabra, 1973). Before returning to Spain, he published in 1971 Teachings of Age (Poetry 1945‚Äì1970), a volume collecting the first six books of poems. He returned to Spain and his professorship in 1975 (according to some), in 1977 according to others. The editorial Trotta in Madrid has undertaken the publication of his Complete Works, which led to his writing four volumes: the first of Poetry (1998), the second and third of aesthetics and literary theory, and the fourth in the history of ideas. He died in Barcelona in 1996, at seventy years of a terminal illness, while devoting his energies to investigate the latest work of Kierkegaard. Work In his critical work is worth mentioning Studies on the poetic word (1952), Humboldt and the philosophy of language (1955), History of literature (1957), Letters to a skeptical priest in modern art (1959), Life and death of ideas: small stories thoughts (1981), Aesthetic Dictionary or monographs on Azor√≠n (1971), Antonio Machado (1975), James Joyce (1978 and 1982), or Nietzsche. Of importance are his German translations (H√∂lderlin, Rilke, Goethe, Novalis, Brecht, Christian Morgenstern, Hans Urs von Balthasar) and English (theater: complete Shakespeare prose, likewise those of Charles Dickens, T. S. Eliot, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Saul Bellow, Thomas Merton, Edgar Allan Poe, Emily Dickinson, or Joyce's Ulysses (novel), for which he received the Translation Prize Fray Luis de Le√≥n, 1977). In 1960 he received the same award for a collection of Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1990 he was also awarded National Award for the work of a translator. Also translated some poems of Constantine Cavafy from Modern Greek, the New Testament from Ancient Greek, and Romano Guardini from Italian. He prepared, in addition, critical editions of Antonio Machado, one of his favorite authors (New Songs, In an apocryphal songbook and Juan de Mairena) and Azor√≠n (Forgotten Items and Peoples), anthologies of general Spanish and Latin American poetry and specially Luis Felipe Vivanco, Miguel de Unamuno and Ernesto Cardenal. The problems of contemporary art in his book resonated in Letters to a skeptical priest in modern art (1959). He was especially concerned with a particular stream of existentialism: Christian man in what he called, with Damaso Alonso in the prologue to a book of his, uprooted poetry. His early poems have a religious theme. Then he introduced new issues in his poetry, more human, closer to Marxist approaches. It has been said that he was a Christian Marxist, with an approach close to the thesis Liberation Theology. His work is characterized by a marked humanism with intimate touches, making him one of the brightest figures of Spanish poetry scene. A poet of organic books, where the whole is greater than the sum of the constituent poems, his style is characterized by simplicity and expressive language (almost conversational), always looking for openness, purity and precision, without unnecessary rhetoric, in the tradition of Antonio Machado. That desire led him to remove numerous poems from his latest compilation, making it successively smaller. Some of this can be seen in his famous poem about the hanged Fran√ßois Villon. He preferred to express himself in Arte Mayor and the alexandrine. He received inter alia, the National Poetry Award in 1949, the Critics Award in 1962 and the Ciutat de Barcelona Prize for his Collected poems 1945‚Äì1990. In poetry, his books include Hombre de Dios in 1945, La espera in 1949, Versos del domingo in 1954, Voces y acompa√±amientos para San Mateo in 1959, La conquista de este mundo in 1960, A√±os inciertos in 1970, and Ser de palabra in 1976. His personal archive is located in the Pavell√≥ de la Rep√∫blica CRAI Library ‚Äì University of Barcelona . It consists of published and not published writings, handwritten translations and notes; writer's personal papers, letters sent and/or received by Jos√© Mar√≠a Valverde, press clippings, tributes and condolence letters written to the Valverde family.

The Dumas technique has been automated and instrumentalized, so that it is capable of rapidly measuring the crude protein concentration of food samples. This automatic Dumas technique has replaced the Kjeldahl method as the standard method of analysis for nutritional labelling of protein content of foods (except in high fat content foods where the Kjeldahl method is still preferred due to fire risks).  Method  The method consists of combusting a sample of known mass in a high temperature range of 800-900¬∞C chamber in the presence of oxygen. This leads to the release of carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. The gases are then passed over special columns (such as potassium hydroxide aqueous solution) that absorb the carbon dioxide and water. A column containing a thermal conductivity detector at the end is then used to separate the nitrogen from any residual carbon dioxide and water and the remaining nitrogen content is measured. The instrument must first be calibrated by analyzing a material that is pure and has a known nitrogen concentration. The measured signal from the thermal conductivity detector for the unknown sample can then be converted into a nitrogen content. As with the Kjeldahl method, conversion of the concentration of nitrogen in a sample to the crude protein content is performed using conversion factors which depend on the particular amino acid sequence of the measured protein.  Advantages and limitations  The Dumas method has the advantages of being easy to use and fully automatable. It has been developed into a considerably faster method than the Kjeldahl method, and can take a few minutes per measurement, as compared to the hour or more for Kjeldahl. It also does not make use of toxic chemicals or catalysts. One major disadvantage is its high initial cost, although new technology developments are reducing this drawback. Also, as with Kjeldahl, it does not give a measure of true protein, as it registers non-protein nitrogen, and different correction factors are needed for different proteins because they have different amino acid sequences.

Design and development With a large number of surplus trainers available on the post-Second World War market, Fairchild sought a way to modify its existing M-62 trainer and tooling into a four-place personal aircraft. The M-62 was a low-wing, fixed landing gear, open cockpit aircraft. The steel-tube fuselage was widened, a cabin structure was added and retractable landing gear were retrofitted using many of the same gear leg and strut parts. The wing outer panels and tail section remained unchanged. An inline engine installation was initially designed, but a Continental Motors radial was installed. With the introduction of the Beechcraft Bonanza, Ryan Navion, Bellanca Cruisair and the TEMCO F-24 at about the same time, the market was considered too saturated to produce the M-84. Operational history The first flight occurred in December 1945. The prototype was used as an executive transport for five years. On 29 May 1951, the M-84 was donated to Washington County, Maryland with chief pilot Richard A. Henson taxiing the aircraft to the Hagerstown High School in a parade.

Education and career Tammam Hassan (Arabic: ÿ™ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ) was born in 1918 in the Upper Egyptian village of ElKarank. In 1929 Hassan completed memorizing the Qur‚Äôan. The following year he moved to Cairo to attend Al-Azhar primary-school institute. He graduated from Al-Azhar high- school institute in 1939. He attended Dar Al-Ulom College, where he majored in Arabic Language and graduated in 1943 with an associate degree. He then continued to study education and psychology at Dar Al-Ulom College, graduating in 1945 (first honor award) with his teaching license. The following year he moved to London to learn English and finish his graduate studies. Hassan graduated from the University College London (UCL) in 1949 with his master in phonetics. His graduate thesis topic was The Phonetics of \\"ElKarank\\" Dialect (Upper Egypt). Hassan graduated in 1952 from the University College of London with his PhD in phonetics. His dissertation was titled, The Phonetics and Phonology of Aden Arabic (South Arabia). Following the completion of his studies, he traveled to Aden for six months to record the local dialect. The phonological model which he followed was prosodic analysis associated with the British linguists J.R.Firth. Hassan began his career as a teacher of Arabic at a high school in Cairo in 1945. The following year he became a teaching assistant in Arabic, at Dar Al-Ulom College in Cairo. He maintained this position until traveling to London to continue his studies. In 1952 Hassan became an associate professor of Oriental and Semitic Linguistic Studies. He published his first major work in 1955, Language Research Methods, an introductory work which established the use of descriptive method to analyze Fusha, classical Arabic. In 1956 Hassan became a volunteer officer in the Egyptian army during the British, French, and Israeli attack against Egypt. After the war in 1957, Hassan received a delegation for two months at the University of Michigan as part of the Fulbright Program. While in Michigan, he was trained to use modern devices for phonetics labs. He brought equipment with him to Egypt where he established the phonetics lab at the University of Cairo (Alarif, 2002). Hassan became a cultural attach√© at the Egyptian Embassy to Lagos, Nigeria for five years where he linked the educational relations between the private Islamic educational organizations and Egypt. As a result of his connections to the Embassy, Hassan brought many Egyptian teachers to teach in Nigeria. While still in Nigeria in 1964, Hassan was promoted to full professor. The following year he returned to Egypt where he was appointed as the Chair of Arabic Syntax and morphology department and also as the Vice Dean of Dar Al-Ulom College. In 1967 Hassan became a professor at the University of Khartoum for three years, where he established the department of Linguistic Studies. In 1972 he became the Dean of Dar Al-Ulom College where he was the general secretary of the Arabic language committee which is part of the highest council for the Egyptian universities. In the same year Hassan founded the Egyptian Linguistics Assembly. In 1973 he became a professor at Mohammed V University in Morocco where he lived for six years. During the 1880s he became a professor at the Arabic for Non Native Speakers Institute, Umm al-Qura University in Mecca, Saudi Arabia for 16 years. There he founded the Educational Linguistics Department that teaches students to work as Arabic teachers for non-native speakers. In 1996 Hassan returned to Egypt to be an emeritus professor at Dar Al-Ulom College where he was active in the linguistic field in many ways until his death. He died on 11 October 2011 in Cairo. Major contributions to Arabic linguistics After studying under Firth as part of the London School, Hassan became the first linguist to study the phonetics and the phonology systems of Arabic based on modern linguistic methods. This work resulted in his influential text, Language Research Methods. Hassan was also the first Arab linguist to study the root morphology of Arabic words based on the main sounds of a given word rather than the gerund or the past tense form which had been the tradition of his predecessors. Hassan also established a theory on the Arabic dictionary based on vocabulary correlations. He was the first to categorize the Arabic parts of speech into seven parts rather than three which is the common traditional system of Arabic. Basically he used the function of the entities within the context to establish this system in his book, Arabic: its Meaning and Syntax.

Early career Ibrahim-Imam was born into a political family. His father, Ibrahim Imam was the motivating force of the progressive Borno Youth Movement. He earned degrees in Political Science and International Economic Relations from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and the University of Maiduguri. He then entered the banking industry. He was given the title of \\"Mutawalli Borno\\", a senior councillor to the Shehu (traditional ruler) of Borno. He was a childhood friend and business partner of his political opponent in Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff. During the short-lived Nigerian Third Republic Ibrahim-Imam was Borno State chairman of the Social Democratic Party(SDP).https://www.premiumtimesng.com/features-and- interviews/286254-interview-how-11-governors-pressurised-me-to-step-down-from- race-for-apc-national-secretary-kashim-imam.html] He was removed from this position by Maina Maaji Lawan, the Borno State Governor at that time.

It debuted in 1968 became part of Worldloppet in the year 2000. History The beginning of the race goes back to the year 1968, when a group of mountain climbers of TJ Lokomotiva came with an idea of undertaking a race in the Jizera Mountains. They became the forerunners of what is nowadays known as the ‚ÄòJizerska 50‚Äô. The first race was held on 20 January 1968. There were 52 competitors who participated in the race from Bed≈ôichov to Ko≈ôenov and back. The winner was Josef Driml of TJ Lokomotiva Liberec. In 1970 the members of the Peru expedition participated in this race. Unfortunately, they were all buried by an avalanche under Huascar√°n four months later. The fourth year of the race and all next years were therefore held in the memory of these brave men who died in Peru on 31 May 1970 during an infamous expedition. The race became very popular and in 1978 nearly 8,000 competitors participated in the race. In past few years the track was changed, which was a lucky step in order to increase popularity and the value of the race. The Jizersk√° 50 is considered to be a very well organized race. In 1999 it was included in the Worldloppet Ski Federation and in 2003 it was for the first time held as a part of FIS Marathon Cup. Track The race starts at the Bed≈ôichov stadium and goes through Nov√° Louka, Kristi√°nov, Rozmez√≠ Knajpa, Kas√°rensk√° road (along the Jizera river), Hraniƒçn√≠ road, Vla≈°sk√Ω h≈ôeben, Bunkr, Jizerk√°, Pyramida, Bunkr, Promenadn√≠ road, Smƒõdava, Knajpa, Na ƒåihadle, ≈†tolpi≈°sk√° road, Kr√°sn√° M√°≈ô√≠, H≈ôeb√≠nek, B√≠l√° Kuchynƒõ, Olivetsk√° hora, Vladn√≠, U Buku and finishes again at Bed≈ôichov stadium. Doping Tests The first six men and six women to finish the race are subject to testing for the proscribed performance-enhancing substances. The others are tested only in the event of clear suspicion. Results The result calculations are performed by a provider of modern technology for measuring the individual times of all participants. Every competitor is provided with a measurement chip before the start of the race. Participants are required to affix the chip to their left ankle in order to detect their precise time. If the race is completed without the measurement chip, the participant is disqualified. Provision of the race The race is held by the Race Ski Club Jizersk√° pades√°tka. The Race Ski Klub Jizersk√° pades√°tka members are responsible for the entire organisation of the race. The participants of the race can refresh themselves at 6 refreshment stations along the track. Medical care is provided by the mountain rescue service of the Jizera Mountain region.

Once steamed and then fastened or clamped into the desired position and left to dry, the wood will hold the new shape. Steam boxes allow for much more efficient use of wood. Instead of cutting the desired shape away from a large and more expensive piece of wood and leaving much scrap to be discarded, steam boxes allow for a smaller piece to be bent in the general shape and leaving much less scrap. Steam boxes also allow the wood to bend beyond its dry breaking point, which is useful in making extreme curves with the wood. In many cases, the bent piece is stronger than an identical piece cut from larger stock. Steam bending wood allows the wood grain to follow the bend, leaving it strong where a piece cut from larger stock would snap across crosscut grains or laminated joints. The largest steam boxes are used in boat building to bend the large planks for the frame and hull.

The surviving machinery includes a wheel driving pit-wheel and wallower. There is a horizontal mainshaft that once drove 6 pairs of stones, although there are only five that now survive. The mill race still flows through under the building. History Narborough watermill is thought to have been built around 1780 and over the years has been extended, altered and had parts demolished over the long period of its existence. In 1845 the watermill had an extension built on to the North West corner of the mill by the miller Charles Tyssen. However this addition proved to be un-successful as the building had been erected on poor foundations and it began to slowly sink over a period of years. The section, including a miller‚Äôs house which stood to the front, had to be demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. At the same time piling work was done to underpin the remaining building.

Early life and naval career Mitford was born at Mitford, Northumberland. As one of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle he was a cousin to Admiral Robert Mitford the bird-artist and Philip Meadows Taylor (author of Confessions of a Thug), and distantly related to Lord Redesdale (attorney general), William Mitford (historian), the Reverend John Mitford, and Mary Russell Mitford (author of Our Village). The younger son of a younger son, Mitford had to make his own way in life and he chose a career in the navy. The patronage of his relative Lord Redesdale secured him a place as a midshipman on the in April 1795. Mitford was present at the Battle of Hy√®res Islands on 13 July 1795. The next year he moved into the with Captain (later Sir) Samuel Hood, and was present at the disastrous attack on Santa Cruz in July 1797, and at the battle of the Nile on 1‚Äì2 August 1798. Mitford afterwards served under Hood in the and was with him in 1801 in the . From 1804 to 1806 he commanded a revenue cutter on the coast of Ireland, and from 1809 to 1811 was acting-master of the brig in the Mediterranean. In 1808 he married Emily Street of Dalintober, Argyll. The couple had two sons, John (born 1808) and Charles Bertram (born 1810), and two daughters Frances (born 1812) and Emily (born 1815). The marriage ended in separation. The Blackheath affair In late 1811 Mitford received an offer of a position in the civil service from Lady Bridget Perceval, who was daughter-in-law of the Earl of Egmont, and a family connection of Mitford's relative and patron Lord Redesdale. When he returned to England however Mitford found that the position did not exist and Bridget Perceval wanted him instead to join her campaign in support of Princess Caroline (a neighbour in Blackheath). While Mitford was helping Bridget Perceval place letters in the newspapers he was hidden away in Warburton's private asylum in Hoxton, Whitmore House. In the spring of 1813 Bridget Perceval and Mitford 'overleaped the bounds the prudence' and a letter in The News purportedly signed by Lords Eldon, Castlereagh, and Liverpool and promising Caroline a larger establishment was traced to Mitford, who swore that the letter had originated with Lady Perceval and that he had no idea it was a forgery. Lady Perceval denied all knowledge of the letter and brought a case against Mitford for perjury; Mitford was tried and acquitted. Mitford's stay in Warburton's asylum provided him with the material for two anonymous pamphlets (published in the 1820s) exposing the exploitation, neglect and abuse of patients. He had previously petitioned Parliament to inquire into conditions in Warburton's asylums, but without success. \\"All private mad- houses are alike public evils, that should be destroyed\\" wrote Mitford. Literary career Mitford spent the rest of his life in London, making a living from writing and editing and by all accounts living a hand-to-mouth existence. In 1818 he produced a book of verse, The poems of a British sailor, some of which had been written when he was at sea and others while he was working for Bridget Perceval. The same year saw the publication (under the pseudonym of Alfred Burton) of Mitford's most famous work: The adventures of Johnny Newcome in the navy, a poem in four cantos, illustrated by Thomas Rowlandson. Johnny Newcome (a generic term for new recruits) is a clergyman's son who is forced to leave school and join the navy when his clergyman father loses all his money in a banking crash. He embarks on HMS Capricorn at Sheerness and, under the good Captain Dale his career prospers, but in Jamaica yellow fever strikes the ship, Captain Dale dies and is replaced by the bullying Captain Teak, and Johnny regretfully leaves the navy. Another edition of Johnny Newcome appeared the following year, and the poem was reprinted by Methuen in 1905. Mitford wrote the poem in six weeks whilst sleeping out in Bayswater Fields under a shelter made of nettles, and washing in a gravel pit. To keep the poetry flowing, his publisher allowed him a shilling a day; he lived on bread and cheese and spent the rest on gin. Mitford's other works include: *The adventures of a post captain, a poem in similar style to The adventures of Johnny Newcome in the navy which recounts the adventures of Captain Bowsprit. *A peep into Windsor Castle after the lost mutton, a satirical pro-Caroline poem about the Prince Regent *The king is a true British sailor, a song about King William IV. Other works have been attributed to Mitford, including: Confessions of Julia Johnstone, written by herself in contradiction to the fables of Harriette Wilson (1825) As an editor, he worked on: Scourge, or Monthly exposure of Imposture and Folly (1811‚Äì1814); New Bon- Ton magazine or the Telescope of the Times (1818‚Äì21); New London Rambler‚Äôs Magazine (1828‚Äì30). At the time of his death he was editing the Quizzical Gazette and Merry Companion. Mitford defended the reputation of Emma, Lady Hamilton when Edward Pelham Brenton, in his Naval history of Great Britain, accused her of having demanded to be rowed round the Minerva to see Admiral Caracciolo hanging. Mitford wrote a letter to the Morning Post denying Brenton's version of events; Brenton in turn dismissed Mitford as someone who lodged 'over a coal shed in some obscure street near Leicester Square'. But more eyewitnesses, including Francis Augustus Collier, came forward to dispute Brenton's version of events and support Mitford's. Mitford died of a chest infection in St Giles workhouse in December 1831, aged 49, and was buried in the graveyard at St Dunstan's, Fleet Street. Mitford's unconventional life- style and association with publishers such as William Benbow and Edward Duncombe made him the subject of harsh criticism, although his talents as a writer were recognised. William Howitt referred to him as \\"one of the most deplorable instances of misused talents, and one of the most pitiable victims of intemperance and want of prudence\\", while another Victorian writer described him in the following terms: \\"Jack was a respectable classical scholar, and possessed some literary ability; but, instead of devoting his talents to any useful purpose, he prostituted them to the lowest ends. Drink, drink, drink! became his besetment and from the day it did so his ignoble fate was sealed.\\" More recently he has been described as \\"a brilliant hack satirist with an intimate knowledge of the Royal domestic politics\\" and capable of \\"more than passable satirical verse\\".

In the Second Partition of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth (1793), Prussia had acquired South Prussia, and had established a branch of its Cadet Corps schools in Kalisch. In 1804, in Warsaw, a humanistic secondary school for boys was opened, divided according to the Prussian educational model into six classes, plus two preparatory ones. In German, it taught Latin, Greek, German and French, philosophy, ethics, mathematics and natural sciences, and (in Polish) the Polish language. Samuel Linde was appointed director of the Warsaw Lyceum. The Evangelical-Augsburg Lutheran from Thorn in Royal Prussia had studied theology and philology at the University of Leipzig and had taught the Polish language there. From 1795 he had been librarian to J√≥zef Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski, and had gathered material for his future S≈Çownik jƒôzyka polskiego (Dictionary of the Polish Language), a six-volume monolingual dictionary which he published in Warsaw in 1807‚Äì14. Linde faced difficulties in organizing the school, and with Prussian authorities who insisted on German as the language of instruction.Zbigniew Goli≈Ñski, Miscellanea z doby O≈õwiecenia (Enlightenment Miscellanea), vol. 6, 1982, p. 123. Following Napoleon's victory over Prussia, in 1807 Warsaw became the capital of the Duchy of Warsaw. With Linde continuing as the Lyceum's director, the school was now modeled after the French system, while Polish replaced German as the primary language of instruction at the Liceum Warszawskie (Warsaw Lyceum). The school was initially located in the leased north wing of the Saxon Palace, named after and owned by the German House of Wettin. Two Wettin Electors of Saxony had been kings of Poland between 1697 and 1763, and a third Saxon ruled the Duchy of Warsaw from 1807 until Napoleon's defeat in 1814. One of the teachers of French language was, from October 1810, Nicolas Chopin, father of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. The young composer was one of the Lyceum's most famous pupils, beginning his studies there in the autumn of 1823.Ate≈ü Orga, Chopin, The illustrated lives of the great composers, Omnibus Press, 1983, , 9780711902473, p. 15. Samuel Linde remained the Lyceum's director when the city, in 1815, came under Russian control as part of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned for military use, and the Lyceum was moved to the Kazimierz Palace. The latter had, until 1795, hosted the Warsaw Corps of Cadets, and in 1816 had been made the home of the newly established University of Warsaw. (The Kazimierz Palace currently houses the Warsaw University rectorate.) When the November 1830 Uprising was suppressed in 1831, the Russian Empire regained control of Warsaw, and the Warsaw Lyceum was closed.

Whilst serving as the physician- in-ordinary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Thompson became involved in the Women's National Health Association of Ireland, an initiative of Lady Aberdeen. Thompson was knighted in 1907 for services to medicine. Throughout his career Thompson paid particular attention to infantile diseases and tuberculosis, serving as a member of the committee for the 1907 Tuberculosis Exhibition. The resulting lecture, Home treatment and nursing of pulmonary tuberculosis in Dublin, was included in the second volume of three of Ireland's Crusade Against Tuberculosis (1908-1909), published by Lady Aberdeen. He became Registrar General for Ireland in 1909 and served until 1926. Thompson was in this office during the Spanish flu epidemic, and noted that the Irish deaths attributed to it were conservative. He was appointed Chairman of Census Commission in 1911, overseeing the first census of the Irish Free State in 1926. He served as the 26th president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland from 1918 to 1920. Thereafter held a large number of other positions, dealing both with medicine and statistics. He was a frequent contributor to the Dublin Journal of Medical Science and similar journals.

They were a member of the Central Hockey League during the 2000-01 season and played at the Four States Arena. History The Central Hockey League announced that Canadian developer John Barath had been awarded an expansion franchise in Texarkana for the 2000-01 season. The expansion team‚Äôs arrival was met with skepticism when the Texarkana Gazette reported that Barath had previously abandoned the Tucson Gila Monsters, a team he earlier had owned in the West Coast Hockey League. Operating from the CHL‚Äôs smallest market, the team was already in trouble by November of its inaugural season, both on and off the ice. One problem was that the Four States Arena was a converted warehouse that would leak onto the ice with a small amount of rain. Crowds had dropped from nearly 4,000 to under 2,200; the team had already seen two head coacheshttp://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0023972001.html and was on its third general manager; and soon the Bandits were no longer paying their bills. On February 20, 2001, with $80,000 in dues payments owed to the league, the CHL terminated the franchise. The team's record in its only season was 11 wins, 37 losses and 4 ties.http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/border- city-bandits-4914.html The one positive note is during a game versus the San Antonio Iguanas, the Bandits goaltender Jean-Ian Filiatrault stopped an amazing 60 of 61 shots in one game, which still stands as a single game record in the CHL.

A finished study for it, in the form of a painting, is in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Merseyside. History Maclise received the commission for two wall paintings in the Royal Gallery in 1857; these were to depict The Meeting of Wellington and Bl√ºcher after the Battle of Waterloo and The Death of Nelson. However Maclise found that creating the works in fresco would prove too difficult, and he resigned the commission. He then discovered the waterglass technique (infusing the surface with sodium silicate) and resumed the commission. Maclise started work on The Meeting of Wellington and Bl√ºcher in January 1860 and completed it during the winter of 1861. He then submitted a sketch for The Death of Nelson to the Fine Arts Commission. However Prince Albert, the prime promoter of the Commission, died in 1861 and the Commission lost some of its momentum. It was not until 1863 that Maclise received permission to continue with the scheme. Between 1859 and 1864 Maclise created a plan for this picture; this was a painting that comprised a \\"finished study\\" for the work. This painting was purchased by the Walker Art Gallery in 1892 from the Art Union of London; the money for this was obtained from the Liverpool Naval Exhibition. The wall paintings did not survive well; by 1869 the colours were fading. However modern critics continue to praise \\"their serious and sombre realism and their expressive power\\". The two paintings Detail from The Death of Nelson in the Palace of Westminster The study, copied for the wall painting, was created in 1859‚Äì64 and is organised as a frieze, in a long narrow format. It shows the dying Admiral Nelson on the deck of HMS Victory, cradled in the arms of Captain Hardy, with other figures, including Dr Beatty, leaning over him. They are surrounded by members of the crew. Maclise took trouble over the accuracy of details in the picture; he interviewed survivors of the battle and researched the naval equipment in use at the time. However the painting is not an accurate account of the event, because Nelson was quickly taken below decks, where he died; it is rather an idealisation of the event. Included in the painting are two black people; this is likely to be historically accurate as two men from Africa were included in the crew of HMS Victory. At this time people of African descent were integrated with other members of the crew, although they tended to work in the lower ranks. One of the Africans is pointing towards the assassin of Nelson. The Engraving The Maclise painting was engraved by Charles W. Sharpe in 1876 and published the Art Union of London. It sold widely around the British Empire.Dan Conlin, \\"Trafalgar Day: The Death of Nelson\\", The Marine Curaotr's Blog Maritime Museum of the Atlantic The Nelson engraving was often sold with an engraving of the companion work by Maclise, \\"Wellington Meeting Blucher at the Battle of Waterloo\\". Other depictions of the event In the 19th century the death of Nelson was a popular subject for artists. Other notable paintings of the event include The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805 painted by Arthur William Devis in 1805 now found at National Maritime Museum, and The Death of Nelson painted by Benjamin West in 1806 and now at the Walker Art Gallery.

His work includes woodcarving, painting, poetry, and essays. He has been described as an innovator, whose works pushed the boundaries of what was expected from Northwest Coast art. Throughout his career he spoke on behalf of Alaska Native artists and visual artists in general. He taught at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) as a guest professor and gave presentations and lectures at elementary schools throughout the states of Alaska and Washington. Early life Schoppert was born in Juneau, Alaska to a father of German descent and a Tlingit ( or ) mother.Jim Schoppert: Instrument of Change: Retrospective Exhibition. Anchorage Museum of History and Art, Anchorage, 1997. Career Clam Shell (1992) ‚Äì wood, pigment, glue rattle In 1973, Schoppert came to Anchorage for a construction job which, it turned out, was no longer available. On February 26 of that year, using the last of his money, he bought a piece of soapstone and carved an owl.Julie Decker. Icebreakers: Alaska's Most Innovative Artists. Anchorage Museum, Anchorage, 1999. He put it up for sale at the urging of his sister and was able to sell it quickly, which marked the formal beginning of his career as an artist. Understanding that knowledge was important, he went on to earn a BFA from the University of Alaska Anchorage and a MFA from the University of Washington. But \\"his apprenticeship was with himself\\" according to Steven Brown, associate curator at the Seattle Art Museum. Continuing to produce work while still an undergraduate, he won first place in the statewide Earth, Fire and Fiber juried show in 1976. This sculpture should have been an indication of things to come as it was a separation from his customary work which would define him as an artist and create controversy and curiosity in later years. Although he created art using the formline, he chose a different approach for a great deal of his work that did not neatly fit into either maintstream or Northwest Coast art. He was quoted as saying \\"There is tremendous pressure for conformity from collectors and scholars, who want work that fits into the classic definition of Northwest Indian art. When things don't fit their expectations there's a raised eyebrow, and a sort of suggestion of 'What do we do with it now?'\\". This mindset is what allowed Schoppert to create his most recognizable pieces which are large carved panels made of multiple planks, painted in colors not associated with historical Tlingit carving, and the planks rearranged to create an entirely new look and a break from established methods and formline. Examples of this style are seen in his works Teasing Eagle and Raven Opens Box of Stars. During his career as an artist he also served on the state arts councils of both Alaska and Washington. He created the North Coast Indian flat design that is on the entrance to the west end of the I-90 tunnel in Seattle. There are several of his works throughout Alaska and Washington. This includes one of the last pieces he made, a large carving for the Port of Seattle to be installed at the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. Artwork Blueberries (1986). Schoppert's artwork covered a wide range of techniques such as woodcarving, abstract paintings, drawings, mask making, and, most notably, his large, carved panel pieces. The wood panel pieces are also what created some controversy over whether his art was mainstream or Northwest Coastal. Schoppert learned that the Tlingit formline that was considered the customary method was only a relatively recent development among the Northwest Indian. It was his opinion that enforcing the practices of the 1850s or 1950s as the rule for all time amounted to artistic tyranny. He has been quoted as saying \\"Learn the rules, then break them\\". When talking about his panels, his intention was to further the art by following what he considered its natural progression. \\"If Art has a Master, Imagination cracks the whip\\".(1987) It is clear that he was true to his beliefs when examining his work. He went beyond the boundaries of established Northwest Coastal art and was a contributor to the evolution of contemporary Native art.Smithsonian National Museum on the American Indian of Change: Retrospective Exhibition 1947-1992 Modern Mask 1992 Although Schoppert is best known for his panels, he also produced several pieces that followed conventional methods and formline design. This is most evident in his mask making, an example of Jim using this style can be found in his mask Forehead Mask (1977) and Mussel Shell Rattle (1992). In addition he had several paintings and drawings that incorporate Indigenous subject matter but do not use of formline. =Exhibitions= * 1984: \\"The New Native American Aesthetic\\", Marilyn Butler Gallery, Santa Fe * 1984: C.
