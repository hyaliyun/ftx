Overview The complex is part of the Eglin AFB overwater range that provides 86,500 square miles of overwater airspace that is jointly used for a variety of test and evaluation activities and training exercises. Range operations rely on land-based radar and electro-optical time-space-position- information systems to monitor and transfer test data to the Central Control Facility on Eglin AFB. These instrumentation systems, located on Santa Rosa Island and other locations provide coverage for test and evaluation activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The use of Santa Rosa Island (SRI) is evolving due to changes in threats to national security and the effects of hurricanes over the past decade. The SRI complex is used for Expanded Surf Zone Testing/Training, SABRE Mine Clearing Testing, Beach Obstacle Clearing and Neutralization, Small Boat Obscurant Testing, Expanded OA-HITL Tower Testing, Live Fire, Expanded Special Operations Training, Amphibious Assaults, and Expanded LCAC Training/Testing. =Sites= Operational sites on SRI include the following locations:Eglin AFB Santa Rosa Island Mission Utilization Plan.

Tomahawk Sandia, Honest John launch complex. * A-15A * A-17A * A-18 .* Located on non-government controlled property on SRI. History =World War II= Established during World War II, the complex is a government controlled part of the island. In June 1944, Germany began bombarding England, especially London, with the V-1 flying bomb. In July 1944, parts of a V-1 salvaged by the Polish underground and recovered from crashed but unexploded bombs, were flown to Wright-Patterson Field and within three weeks America had completed its first copy of a V-1, the Republic-Ford JB-2, the United States‚Äô first operational guided missile and the predecessor of the modern cruise missile. Eglin Field was chosen to test launching techniques. Eglin received its first JB-2 for testing in the fall of 1944. Three sites were created on Eglin's Gulf-side property, all designed to test different launching techniques. Two sites are located within a half mile of each other on Santa Rosa Island, on Air Force property. Recorded as Florida archeological sites 8OK246 and 8OK248, the remnants of these two JB-2 test sites, along with bunkers and debris fields from unsuccessful test flights, were identified as part of Eglin's initial historic property inventory. After identification, these were evaluated for historic significance and subsequently added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 1996. * Site 8OK246 ()is the remains of a JB-2 mobile launch site, containing two concrete pads and an observation bunker, all virtually unscathed. Abandoned to the elements, there is a JB-2 wreck south of the ramp. Although the ramp itself is missing, its concrete pillars stand against the passage of time. * Site 8OK248 () is the remains of a JB-2 launch ramp (pillars only) and a concrete blockhouse. Most of the facility is covered by sand, it is rumored that there are up to 18 JB-2's buried in the area. Access to the sites are restricted by the National Park Service and the United States Air Force. A third launching site, is now located on the Coffeen Nature Preserve, a Sierra Club property east of Destin, Florida, featured a concrete inclined launch ramp. Steam-powered and portable ramps were also tested at this site. All of the Eglin launchings were directed south to the Gulf of Mexico. The targets were buoys placed at measured distances, up to 150 miles, to which the headings and range of the guidance system were adjusted. There is no evidence that live warheads were used, as many of the wrecks examined by Eglin archeologists have concrete ballast filling the warhead compartment. With the sudden end of the war, the Army Air Force had 1,300 JB-2s in its arsenal. On January 26, 1946, Army Air Forces created the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group to develop and test the missiles at Eglin. The JB-2 testing at Santa Rosa continued until March 1946, when the project was canceled. After cancellation, the reusable portions of the sites were disassembled. However, the debris from crashes was left where it fell, and one or more surplus complete JB-2s are reported to have been buried in the surrounding dunes. =Cold War= As the Cold War heated up, the highly instrumented Eglin Gulf Test Range was built and supported flight tests of the CIM-10 Bomarc, MGM-1 Matador, ADM-20 Quail, and AGM-28 Hound Dog aerodynamic missiles. The first BOMARC launch from Santa Rosa Island occurred on 15 January 1959. From 1959 through 1960, the BOMARC A underwent continual testing at site A-15, flying against various drone aircraft. In the early 1960s testing continued with the BOMARC B model. Designated the IM-99B, this missile underwent its inaugural service test on 13 April 13, 1960. On 3 March 1961, an IM-99B demonstrated the ability to intercept a target at a range of over 400 miles at an altitude of over 80,000 feet. The test program for BOMARC A and B concluded in August 1963 after nearly 150 launches. BOMARC B launchings continued into the 1970s as each of the USAF and Canadian Air Defense Missile Squadrons took turns conducting missile shoots. Both the military and NASA have used SRI to support launch of atmospheric sounding rockets in support of their programs.

Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Adolescent Family Life Act..  Background  The Adolescent Family Life Act was implemented by the United States Congress in 1981 as an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. The purpose behind this statute was to combat the social and economic consequences associated with pregnancy and childbirth among unmarried youths. The statute sought to achieve this goal by promoting ‚Äú‚Ä¶ adolescent premarital sexual abstinence, adoption as an alternative to early parenting, parenting and child development education, and comprehensive health, education, and social services‚Ä¶‚Äù In order to effectively promote these behaviors and services, the statute permitted federal funds to go toward public and private organizations that offer services and research toward premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy. One of the statute's provisions required that AFLA grants may not be given to programs that provide abortion counseling, nor to programs that promote abortion as a valid means of birth control. In 1983, a group of federal taxpayers, clergymen, and the American Jewish Congress filed suit against Otis R. Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, arguing that the Adolescent Family Life Act violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Establishment Clause forbids Congress from passing laws ‚Äú‚Ä¶ respecting an establishment of religion‚Ä¶‚Äù As a result of the AFLA, federal grants were distributed to religious organizations that encourage adolescents to refrain from involvement in sexual relationships. The plaintiffs argued that federal funds directed towards religiously affiliated organizations have the effect of advancing religion and thus are unconstitutional. Supreme Court Decision When deciding this case, the United States Supreme Court applied the three-part test set forth by Lemon v. Kurtzman. According to this test, a statute will be upheld if it can satisfy each of the following three parts: 1) the statute has a secular legislative purpose, 2) its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and 3) it does not excessively entangle government with religion.Gillman, Howard, Mark A. Graber, and Keith E. Whittington. \\"Chapter 10: The Reagan Era.\\" American Constitutionalism: Rights and Liberties. Vol 2. New York: Oxford UP, 2013. 760-64. Print. The Court first held that the Adolescent Family Life Act had a secular purpose, as it was enacted to combat the social and economic problems associated with teenage sexuality, pregnancy, and parenthood, with no reference to religious matters. Second, the Court found that the extent to which this statute advances religion is ‚Äúincidental and remote‚Äù at most. The statute does not require that any grant recipients be affiliated with a religious organization and the services that the act provides are not themselves religiously motivated. Lastly, the Court found that the statute does not excessively entangle government with religion because it requires that the grants be monitored to ensure that the federal funds are being spent in the manner intended by Congress. Therefore, since the Court found that the Adolescent Family Life Act satisfies all three parts of the Lemon test, the statute's constitutionality was upheld. On January 19, 1993 the parties agreed to a settlement regarding the federal funds distributed by the Adolescent Family Life Act. The settlement required that sexuality education funded by the Act ‚Äú‚Ä¶ may not include religious references, may not be offered in a site used for religious worship services, or offered in sites with religious iconography.‚Äù See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 487 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court  References  External links * United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Establishment Clause case law 1988 in United States case law 1988 in education ","title":"Bowen v.

Chen forcibly entered the Alexanders' home at approximately 7:00 pm (Taiwan time) that evening and was captured the following day and executed roughly two years later. Background Chen Chin-hsing had been involved in the murder of Pai Hsiao- yen, the daughter of famed Taiwanese actress Pai Bing-bing. His wife and two other relatives were imprisoned for their alleged involvement in the murder while he was on the run. Incident At around 7:00 pm Taiwan time, Chen Chin-hsing () forcibly entered the Alexander house via the garage. The first person to see him was McGill Alexander's twelve-year-old daughter, Christine, who was playing piano at the time. Chen put his arm around her neck, and forced her to walk upstairs, where the rest of the family was. Chen instructed Daughter, Melanie Alexander at gunpoint to call CNN. She phoned her friend Michael, who worked at CNN. Within an hour, media were alerted to the situation and police officers surrounded the house. As police surrounded the house, they reportedly taunted Chen. As the police advanced towards the house, after Chen had warned them to stay away, Chen opened fire with one of his guns. The other one was kept pointed at Melanie, whom he was using as a human shield. After repeated begging by Mr Alexander, Chen released Melanie and instead took Mr Alexander as a human shield. By this point, the police had entered the house via the garage door. Chen fired shots at the policemen surging up the stairs to his position, and they retreated to the garage. As Chen was firing at police, one of his shots went through Melanie's wrist and into her back, lodging between two arteries in her pelvis. Mr. Alexander was also shot in the leg. =Negotiations= Chen had promised to release the hostages if Frank Hsieh, a renowned politician, personally came to negotiate the release of his wife and brother. At 9:00 pm Taiwan time, Frank Hsieh arrived. Negotiations started at 10:00 with success in ensuring the release of Mr Alexander and his daughter Melanie for treatment of their wounds sustained. Further negotiations ended in the release of the family's foster son and Christine. Mrs. Alexander was the last hostage released by Chen. The release of Mrs Alexander on 19 November 1997 brought an end to the crisis. Police announced an end to the crisis at 4:00 pm. =Capture and execution of Chen= After the hostages were released, police seized Chen. Chen was found guilty on charges including sexual assault, kidnapping, and murder and executed on 6 October 1999. Aftermath After the event, the Alexanders publicly forgave Chen before his execution. Additionally, as a longstanding result of the crisis, Taiwanese police developed better tactics to combat hostage situations. Mr Alexander wrote a book about the event, Hostage in Taipei, which was published by Cladach Publishing in 2000. It was translated into Chinese the following year as True Love, and published by Cosmax.

Educated in music and movie-making, he creates his works in diverse disciplines as an author, photographer, movie director, stage director and composer. His creations (poems, videos, photographs, movies , music and event installations) are always articulated around the theme of poetry. Drawing inspiration from classical references, Leonardo Marcos is behind the creation of new forms of artistic expression such as Digital Poetry, Interactive poetry and Electro-poetry. Femininity, presented in a psychological duality, is a core part of his creative influences. Through his art, the artist highlights the beauty of women in a world of dreams and fantasy.  Biography  = Early life = Son of Spanish libertarian exiles who came from Argentina, he was born in Paris. His parents were taken in for a while by Agn√®s Varda who photographed regularly this family of political immigrants. She made the film documentary Ulysse, name of Leonardo's cousin whom she photographed as a child; the film was awarded a C√©sar. = Artistic and professional background = Leonardo Marcos‚Äô father, a self-taught music lover, was able to leave the construction business where he was a worker to become a piano maker. Music will play an important role in the art work of his son Leonardo. He learned to play classical piano but he was also interested in Rock music and decided to get a band together with the start of the punk movement and the new wave. Serge Gainsbourg, who gave him his friendly support, introduced him to record companies and he was signed up by Philippe Constantin with Barclay. The song \\" Illusions perdues \\" by his band Jours √©tranges, was released in 1986. His concerts present creations with a multidisciplinary dimension including video and staging of living tableaux. After entering the √âcole du Louvre, he chooses to specialize as a post-grad in movie history under the direction of Gilles Deleuze. Parallel to this, Leonardo gets to meet Freddy Hausser, producer who made video clips and TV shows and a friend of the Rolling Stones. He teaches him television journalism and live shows on channel La Cinq with Guillaume Durand. During the Rumanian revolution, the new concept of live news broadcasting makes him choose a career as a journalist producer. He made many news coverages and TV shows mainly on fashion on an international level, via the press agency WTN and for BRUT, a magazine on Arte. His interest in new audiovisual formats leads him to produce films and events for brands. He is in charge of programming artistic events in Le O, a venue upstairs of Rendez-Vous Toyota where he proposes innovative creations combining electro music and images. This will be the starting point of his multidisciplinary artistic career. = Artistic career = As of 2005, Leonardo Marcos multiplies artistic events that helped to promote his poems in particular modes of dissemination: gigantic projections in the street at the Centre d‚Äô√©tudes catalanes of the Sorbonne Nouvelle, at the galerie RX and at the Maison de la Catalogne for the White Night. Marcos also designed with one of his poems a new Mona Lisa in digital art form through an initiatory route at the Louvre Museum. In his event shows at the galerie Amicorum St Honor√© et Papillon, he created animations and performances around his works. At the mus√©e national de la Marine, he presented in the form of visual projections, dithyrambs, written in the original classical style. Many performances were made during those exhibitions as well as in the musical scenic context of La G√©n√©rale des arts and at the Media village. The staging of those performances expresses the obsessions and deviances of the artist which are the main source of inspiration of his art. One of the major themes is the multiplicity of feminine characters. The idea of a feminine double is presented in a \\" dominant-dominated \\" balance of power that reveals an unbearable inner conflict full of sensuality and lightness. His encounter with Catherine Robbe-Grillet led to a book published in 2011, Images publiques, images priv√©es, including interviews and photographs. This book was followed by an exhibition at the galerie du Passage ‚Äì Pierre Passebon, which also hosted art shows of David Lynch, Karl Lagerfeld, Christian Louboutin and Irina Ionesco. During his exhibition, Leonardo Marcos showed films and photographs with Arielle Dombasle and Farida Khelfa in a tribute to Alain Robbe-Grillet. In 2013, the artist published for Les √©ditions de la Diff√©rence, Les Filles du cahier vol√©, a book written together with R√©gine Deforges and Manon Abauzit. The book reported on the difficult adolescence and the discrimination suffered by R√©gine Deforges. It included photographs shown mainly at the galerie du Passage with a text by Sonia Rykiel. Several artistic events surrounded the launch of the book, including performances in a XIIth century church in Montmorillon. The following year, in 2014, the artist also exhibited his Polaroid photographs in the Japanese galerie Toko in Paris. In 2016, he explored new forms of art around the concept of \\" Digital Poetry \\" by making a digital work of art with one of his poems that was initially presented at the Palais de Tokyo. The Cr√©dit Agricole CIB asked him to make a permanent digital installation in their headquarters. He designed to that effect a digital poem made of projections, pictures and sound recordings. The permanent diffusion of a series of creations of an animated poem was a first in the field of digital art and poetry. This approach confirmed the will of the artist to give poetry a new art form to reach a wider audience. In diverse artistic events, Leonardo Marcos introduces poetry thanks to giant projections, particularly during the Parisian parties at the Tigre and at the H√¥tel Particulier Montmartre. His creations were selected by Arielle Dombasle and Mauboussin for the launch and the communication campaign of her perfume \\" Le secret d‚ÄôArielle \\", accompanied by an art showhttp://www.parisetudiant.com/etudiant/sortie/feline-s-mood-6-by- leonardo.html. In his book La Galerie des Beaut√©s, Leonardo Marcos pays a tribute to feminine beauty through a series of portraits, including H.R.H. Princess Caroline of Hanovre or Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, the widow of the painter Balthus. During the show for the launch of the book, Leonardo Marcos also did projections of his poems and \\" poetic \\" chats, via the Internet, between the visitors and three of his models. He continues working for different brands as the film-maker for Herm√®s for all the films for the Fondation d‚Äôentreprise Herm√®s.  Concepts  The art of Leonardo Marcos is in the pursuit of artistic innovations. He invents new concepts to let poetry find a place outside of books with the goal of making it more accessible. = Digital Poetry = Digital poetry presents texts in the form of video projections. It consists in a visual poetry where the words are graphically animated. = Electro-Poetry = On the dance-floor of clubbing evenings, texts are read by young models chosen by Leonardo Marcos with an electro music background. = Interactive Poetry = Models or muses chat live on computer screens with visitors during artistic events. They write, depending on the type of content, excerpts from the artist's poems. = Artistic approach = His approach deals in giving a new life to poetry by taking it out of its classical book context. He calls it the New Poetry. The art of Leonardo Marcos is figurative, mannerist and traditional in response to current contemporary. His works remain avant-garde, particularly thanks to the use of new technological processes that he puts at the service of his creative inventions, his style and its form.  Events  Leonardo Marcos has taken part in many events, often in the setting of the White Night and the Printemps des po√®tes, for the Mus√©e National de la Marine, the Centre d‚Äô√âtude Catalane of the Sorbonne Nouvelle, the Coll√®ge des Bernardins, the maison de la Catalogne, the church of Saint-Merri, the Mus√©e de la Vie romantique and also the G√©n√©rale des arts.

Early life Armand was born in Voiron, France, the son of Joseph Antoine Guy Allard du Plantier (1721‚Äì1801) and Gabrielle Trenonay de Chanfrey. Move to America In 1781, he moved to Louisiana (New Spain), settling on the plantation of his uncle, Claude Tr√©nonay, in the area of Pointe Coup√©e on the Mississippi River. He married his uncle's stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gerard; the couple had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Marie Augustine died of yellow fever in 1799. In 1802 Duplantier remarried, to widow Constance Rochon Joyce, and the couple resided part of the time in their country house at Mount Magnolia plantation (which property today is within the city of Baton Rouge and owned by that city). Five more children were born of this union. Duplantier was disturbed by the slave revolt which occurred locally in 1794 or 1795. It was called the Pointe Coup√©e Conspiracy and reminded him of the Haitian Revolution (1791‚Äì1804). He was a slave-owner and regretted that he had bought some Saint-Domingue slaves, but he did not want to sell them until they regained their value. Later life Armand Duplantier helped to establish a college in Baton Rouge in 1822. A few years later, he was part of the delegation which welcomed the Marquis de Lafayette, during his American tour. In 1827, Duplantier, Fulwar Skipwith, Antoine Blanc, Thomas B.

Specifically, the company focuses on improving the stability of biological materials, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, cells from patient samples used in research, and diagnostic testing reagents. Company scientists have developed alternatives to existing preservation technologies, such as cold storage and lyophilization (freeze-drying), to prevent degradation of perishable biological materials. Biomatrica's technologies are used in applications such as pre-analytic sample collection, diagnostic assays, biobanking, forensics, and basic research. History Biomatrica was founded by scientists, Judy M√ºller-Cohn, PhD, and Rolf M√ºller, PhD, in 2004. Prior to founding Biomatrica, both had worked many years in San Diego's biotechnology industry. Judy M√ºller-Cohn was previously Director of Business Development at Digital Gene Technologies and a scientist at Mycogen/ Dow Agrosciences. Rolf Muller had been a visiting Scientist and Director of Assay Development and High Throughput Screening for the HIV Core Program Project Grant at San Diego's prestigious Scripps Research Institute. Prior to that, he served as a scientific director at HK Pharmaceuticals and Digital Gene Technologies, as well as a scientist at the Salk Institute studying cell signaling and viral based gene therapy approaches. Biomatrica initially developed ambient temperature storage reagents for DNA and RNA. The company's core technology was inspired by the phenomenon of anhydrobiosis, the ability of some organisms to hibernate in a desiccated state during dry periods, and then reanimate upon contact with water. Focusing their studies on microscopic, desert-dwelling creatures called Tardigrades, which undergo anhydrobiosis for up to 120 years, Biomatrica scientists identified how to chemically mimic the mechanism of anhydrobiosis. According to Rolf M√ºller, ‚ÄúWhat we create(d) is a thermostable, dissolvable glass that packages every single molecule in a sample.‚Äù Following stabilization at room temperature with Biomatrica's chemical reagents, biological specimens could be rehydrated for subsequent studies with the addition of a few drops of water. Since 2012, the company has become increasingly focused on its pre-analytic collection and assay stabilization service businesses described below.  Products and Services  The company's first product was a dry, synthetic polymer, \\"DNAstable\\" (originally ‚ÄúSampleMatrix‚Äù), a chemical formulation that stabilized purified DNA at ambient temperature. In 2006, it was awarded the Most Innovative Product of the Year award from the San Diego non-profit technology/business organization CONNECT.\\"James Flanigan (September 17, 2008). \\"Helping New Technologies Grow Into Businesses, the San Diego Way\\".

Liquid versions of DNAstable and RNAstable were launched as DNAstable LD and RNAstable LD in 2011 and 2012, respectively. These liquid products provide more flexibility for diverse experimental formats, including those utilizing automated instrumentation. Biomatrica began commercialization of preanalytical products in 2009 with the launch of its ‚Äúgard‚Äù product line. These products include RNAgard Blood, DNAgard Blood, and DNAgard Tissue and Cells, products designed to stabilize biological samples from collection to analytical testing. In 2013, the company launched a device, DNAgard Saliva, for the collection of salivary DNA samples to be used in a variety of research studies. In 2015, a completely redesigned and improved version of this device was launched under the name DNAgard Saliva HT. This new version is designed and optimized for use by high-throughput laboratory automation instruments. In 2017, the company launched LBgard Blood Tubes, which allow collection and preservation of cfDNA for 14 days, and CTCs and WBCs for 4 days, for liquid biopsy and NIPT applications. In 2012, the company began offering custom stabilization services to diagnostic assay manufacturers under the trade name, AssayStable. This service allowed improved manufacturing and stability of diagnostic test kits. After completing several successful contracts with large diagnostic manufacturers, the company launched a related service, PCRstable, that focused specifically on improving stability of PCR-based, molecular diagnostic assays, including those using microfluidic chips and specialized cartridges and cassettes.\\"Biostabilization Advances Enable Next-Gen Dx\\" Genetic Engineering News October 13, 2014. Retrieved April 8, 2015. To facilitate testing and adoption of the company's stabilizers, Biomatrica launched the ReadyDry PCR Stabilizer Screening Kit in 2016. This kit contains eight chemical stabilizers that can be directly combined with individual PCR components or complete PCR-based assay mixes. Once combined, the reagents can be air dried, allowing for ambient preservation of these reagents with extended shelf-life. Once customers identify the ReadyDry stabilizers that work best for their particular PCR assay, they can be purchased separately.  Partnerships and Agreements  Licensing agreements for Biomatrica technologies were signed with Qiagen in 2007 and 2009. Following the launch of DNAstable, the company gained the interest of law enforcement organizations, such as the California Department of Justice, which sought to stabilize DNA samples from crime scenes for forensics purposes. Other law enforcement organizations, including sheriffs‚Äô departments in Orange County, CA Los Angeles, CA, and Palm Beach, FL, have adopted ambient temperature forensic sample management systems based on Biomatrica's technologies. Kaiser Permanente adopted DNAstable for a large biobanking project in 2010.

It enables equipment manufacturers and shipyards to structure, write and deliver technical manuals, and to load ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CMM (Computerized Maintenance Management) systems with technical manual contents into a standardized electronic format, making them much easier to produce and manage, compared to traditional methods of writing technical manuals using a word processor. Shipdex Protocol covers technical data exchange in any maritime project, and is open to any company or organization which wishes to use it by registering at www.shipdex.org. Organization The Shipdex Protocol was developed by the following (founding member) companies: Grimaldi Compagnia di Navigazione S.P.A., Intership Navigation Co., Ltd., Mastermind Shipmanagement Ltd., Alfa Laval, MacGregor, (a part of Cargotec Group), MAN Diesel & Turbo, SpecTec Group Ltd., and Yanmar Co. Ltd., but was registered as a trademark for copyright purposes under the name of Grimaldi Compagnia di Navigazione S.P.A. and Internship Navigation Ltd. Currently the Shipdex organization is composed of the following Executive Members: MAN ES, Mastermind Shipmanagement (chairman), Rolls-Royce Maritime, Shipdex Consulting (technical manager), Yanmar, G&C; Shipping, Winterthur Gas & Diesel. The Shipdex Protocol is developed, maintained, and promoted by the Shipdex Co. Ltd (CY), a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to standardize the electronic exchange of technical data in the shipping industry. The Shipdex Protocol is maintained by the Shipdex Protocol Maintenance Group (SPMG) which obtains agreements from the Executive Members prior to application changes. The SPMG considers change proposals issued by Shipdex Registered Members at each meeting and may ratify them for incorporation in the Protocol. Any queries or proposals relating to changes to the Protocol are addressed to the Technical Manager of the SPMG using the online \\"Change Proposal Form\\" (CPF) at www.shipdex.com. System architecture The Shipdex Protocol specification criteria were designed to provide the end user with essential, complete, and non-redundant technical information which is linked to logistic studies (if any), equivalent analysis, and related maintenance strategies. Document contents are gathered in an organic way into \\"Data Modules\\" (DMs) defined as \\"the smallest self contained information unit within a Shipdeck data set\\". The structure of these modules vary, depending on the type of data dealt with. Every DM corresponds to a specific, uniquely identified electronic file produced in the XML language, which allows the user to structure and identify each individual piece of information contained into the DM itself. Every DM contains data which can refer to other DMs, to \\"information objects\\" (illustrations, symbols, multimedia objects) or external documents (in PDF or Microsoft Office formats). Specifically, the DMs contain the following types of information: * Identification and status, containing all identification and quality assurance information * Content, which varies, depending on the following Data Module types: * Descriptive * Procedural * Illustrated parts data (IPD) * Maintenance Planning * Service Bulletin * Learning The Data Module types that the Shipdex Protocol makes use of are: Descriptive, Procedural, IPD and schedule. These DM types are governed by the relevant S1000D XML schemas version 2.3 (available for free download from www.s1000d.org) . All Data Modules that are applicable to the \\"product\\" (a civil or military sea vehicle, equipment or facility) may be gathered and managed in a database, called the Common Source Data Base (CSDB). Information is not duplicated in the CSDB, although individual DMs can be used many times in the output.

After 50 years, she returned to films with her last role in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya (2007) as Sonam Kapoor's grandmother. In her times in 1950s, she was considered a glamour girl of Bollywood, so much so, that Life magazine had a special session with her devoted to her fine sensuous photographs. Early life Begum Para was born as Para Haq in Jehlum now a days in Pakistan. Her family was from Aligarh. Her father, Mian Ehsanul-Haq, was a judge who at some point in his life went into the judicial service of the princely state of Bikaner, now northern Rajasthan, where he became chief justice of its highest court. He was a fine cricketer of his time. She was brought up very disciplined yet liberal. She spent her childhood in Bikaner. She was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University. Her elder brother Masrurul Haq, had gone off to Bombay in the late 1930s to become an actor. There he had met and fell in love with the Bengali actress Protima Dasgupta, and married her. Whenever she visited them in Bombay, she was quite taken up with the glitzy world of her sister-in-law. She used to accompany her on many occasions and get-togethers. People would get quite impressed with her looks and offer her a lot of roles. One such offer came from Sashadhar Mukherjee and Devika Rani. Her father consented to her wishes reluctantly, and requested her to never work in Lahore. Career Begum Para's first break turned out to be 1944 film Chand, from Prabhat Studios in Poona. Prem Adib was the hero, and Sitara Devi was the vamp in the film. It did extremely well and Para started getting paid about Rs. 1500 a month. Soon after, she and her sister-in-law Protima made a film called Chamia (1945) based on the novel ‚ÄòPygmalion‚Äô, which again was a huge success. Para signed a lot of films after Chamia, but she couldn‚Äôt quite establish herself as an actress. Because she had a highly scandalous image, people always gave her the role of glamour doll in most films. She didn't mind it because she always played herself on screen. She did Sohni Mahiwal (1946) and Zanjeer (1947) with Ishwarlal and Dikshit; Neel Kamal (1947) with Raj Kapoor; Mehendi (1947) with Nargis; Suhaag Raat (1948) with Bharat Bhushan and Geeta Bali; Jhalka (1948); and Meherbani (1950) with Ajit Khan. She also worked in Ustad Pedro (1951), produced and directed by the then well-known actor, Sheikh Mukhtar. It was a fun film, and was packed with action, romance, and stunts. In 1951 she posed for photographer James Burke for a Life magazine photo shoot. Para's last role was in the movie Kar Bhala in 1956. She was also offered to play Nigar Sultana‚Äôs role 'Bahar' in Mughal-e-Azam (1960). However, she refused to play the role because she considered it against her image. She made a comeback on the silver screen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya in 2007 as Sonam Kapoor's grandmother. Personal life She married actor Nasir Khan, the younger brother of Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar. They had three children, including the actor Ayub Khan. Begum Para's father Mian Ehsan-ul-Haq of Jalandhar, was a judge who joined the princely state of Bikaner, now northern Rajasthan, where he became chief justice of its highest court. Her husband died in 1974. Following her husband's death, she briefly migrated to Pakistan in 1975. Two years later, she relocated back to India. Death She died in her sleep on 9 December 2008 at the age of 81.

In Iraq, Carrie was warned by an asset that an American prisoner of war had been turned by al-Qaeda. Carrie has also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a fact that she conceals from the CIA. She surreptitiously receives medication for the disorder from her sister. Carrie's job grows complicated when her boss, Director of the Counterterrorism Center David Estes, calls Carrie and her colleagues in for an emergency briefing. Carrie learns that Nicholas Brody, a U.S. Marine Sergeant who had been reported as missing in action since 2003, has been rescued during a Delta Force raid on a compound belonging to terrorist Abu Nazir. Carrie comes to believe that Brody is the American prisoner of war whom her asset in Iraq was talking about. However, the federal government and her superiors at the CIA consider Brody a war hero. Later, another Marine captured at the same time, Tom Walker, is also found to be still alive, casting doubt on which of the Marines is the suspected spy. Realizing it would be nearly impossible to convince her boss to place Brody under surveillance, Carrie approaches the only other person she can trust, her mentor, Saul Berenson. The two must now work together to investigate Brody and prevent another terrorist attack on American soil. Eventually, Brody plans to assassinate the Vice President with a suicide vest but falters at the last moment after an emotional conversation with his daughter Dana. Carrie becomes more paranoid that Brody plans to carry out a terroristic act. Reception The first season scored a Metacritic rating of 91 out of 100 from 28 critics. TV Guide named it the best TV show of 2011 and highly applauded the performances by Damian Lewis and Claire Danes. Metacritic determined Homeland to be the second-best TV show of 2011 according to major TV critics, by aggregating the critics' year-end top-ten lists. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post gave the pilot episode an A‚àí, saying \\"What makes Homeland rise above other post-9/11 dramas is Danes's stellar performance as Carrie ‚Äî easily this season's strongest female character,\\" and that \\"The latter half of the first episode is exhilarating. I'm hooked.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said it was his favorite drama pilot of the season, giving it an A. Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker gave it an A‚àí, stating \\"It's the fall season's most intriguing, tense puzzler.\\" IGN TV gave it a positive review, saying that it was an \\"ace thriller\\" that also managed to have something to say about the \\"War on Terror\\". The seventh episode, \\"The Weekend\\", was described by both the creators of the show and Damian Lewis as a \\"watershed\\" episode. Former US President Barack Obama has praised the show.  Home media release  Homeland: The Complete First Season was released as a widescreen region 1 four-disc DVD and three-disc Blu-ray box set in the United States and Canada on August 28, 2012.

The station operated on channel 59 from studios in the Hotel Lafayette in Buffalo. WBES- TV, the second UHF station (and third TV station overall) in Western New York, was very short-lived, signing on September 29, 1953 and shutting down for the last time on December 19 of the same year. An independent station for its entire existence, WBES-TV was plagued by technical and financial problems, the primary factor in the station's failure. Channel 59 was never reissued; it would not be used again in Western New York until being reallocated to Rochester, New York station WHAM-TV, where it was used as the temporary digital channel prior to the digital television transition. WBES-TV has occasionally been erroneously listed as being on channel 56 or 58, two channels that were later issued to other licensees, both low-power stations: 56 became WBXZ-LP, a station operated as of 2015 by Steven Ritchie. Channel 58, last known as WFHW-LP, has also gone silent. Channels 52 through 69 were removed entirely from broadcast television use soon after the 2009 completion of US DTV transition. After WBES-TV was shut down, Buffalo was left with two stations, market leader WBEN-TV (channel 4) and fellow UHF upstart WBUF-TV (channel 17); WGR-TV (channel 2) signed on for the very first time on August 14, 1954, using WBES-TV's broadcast tower.

Published on 8 May 2012, it contains 110 short stories, novellas and short novels. At 1,152 pages in the hardcover edition, it is probably the largest single volume of fantastic fiction ever published, according to Locus. Contents The editors' object in publishing The Weird was to provide, through its contents, a comprehensive definition of \\"the Weird\\", a type of fiction that their introduction describes as \\"as much a sensation\\"‚Äîone of terror and wonder‚Äî\\"as (...) a mode of writing\\", and as a type of fiction that entertains while also expressing readers' dissatisfaction with, and uncertainty about, reality. To that end, The Weird includes works that range from fantasy, science fiction and mainstream literature \\"with a slight twist of strange\\", but it also amounts, according to The Guardian, to \\"a history of the horror story\\". The editors limited their chronologically ordered collection to fiction from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and largely avoided including stories focusing on tropes of the horror genre such as zombies, vampires, and werewolves, to highlight what they considered the Weird's innovative qualities. To cover the genre comprehensively, they commissioned original translations of, among others, works by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Michel Bernanos, Julio Cort√°zar and Georg Heym. The anthology contains the following works:Copied, excepting the translators' names, from: * Foreweird by Michael Moorcock * Introduction by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer * Alfred Kubin, The Other Side (excerpt), 1908 (translation, Austria) * F.

Dick's The Preserving Machine, J. G. Ballard's The Drowned Giant, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings and Otsuichi's The White House in the Cold Forest. Reception The anthology was well received by reviewers from the Financial Times, who called it an \\"authoritative\\" representation of weird fiction, the San Francisco Chronicle, who considered that the volume's broad range of authors proved that \\"the bizarre and unsettling belong to no one race, country or gender\\" and Publishers Weekly, who characterized it as a \\"standard-setting compilation\\" and a \\"deeply affectionate and respectful history of speculative fiction‚Äôs blurry edges\\". Locus magazine's reviewer noted that the anthology's chronological order allowed the reader to construct a \\"fossil record\\" of the Weird's evolution. He wrote that its broad geographical scope made noticeable the distinct traditions of English-language weird fiction, which depict the \\"eruption of the inexplicable into meticulously ordered realities\\", and the traditions represented by many translated works, whose cultures are more thoroughly grounded in folklore and mythology, or which resist a Western impulse toward rationalism and realism. Damien Walter, writing for The Guardian in a pastiche of the genre's style, warned of \\"the madness of the many authors contained in its pages and clearly inhuman determination of its 'editors'\\", prophesying that \\"Soon the chrysalid will form, and The Weird itself will burst into the world as a radiant winged moth of metaphysical doom!\\" The Weird received the British Fantasy Award for best anthology in 2012.

In the West he is usually billed as \\"Evgeny Nikitin\\"http://imgartists.com/artist/evgeny_nikitinhttp://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm Born in the Arctic port city of Murmansk, he trained at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, graduating in 1997. Since his debut as a student he has performed at the Mariinsky Theatre; he also appears as an international soloist. He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in Sergei Prokofiev's War and Peace in 2002; he has regularly returned to the New York company and is due to sing the Wagnerian role of Klingsor in 2013. In 2008 Nikitin was awarded the title of Honoured Artist of Russia. Tattoo controversy Nikitin was scheduled to sing the title role in Wagner's opera The Flying Dutchman at the opening of the 2012 Bayreuth Festival, which would have made him the first Russian in history to assume an opening title role there. But days before the festival began, he withdrew and was replaced by Samuel Youn after tattoos on his chest were shown by German media in still images from a video shot in 2006 or 2007. These suggested Nazi sympathies, which the singer subsequently denied.New York Times The main controversial tattoo in the video still images, a partly covered swastika, had been completely covered by a large 8-pointed star design by the time of the Bayreuth withdrawal. Nikitin released at least two conflicting statements about the matter. First, at Bayreuth, he described the tattooing as a \\"mistake of youth\\" made when he was 16 years old. Second, via the press office of the Mariinsky Theatre,http://www.mariinsky.ru/news1/news2/23_229july/ he explained that a swastika never had been his intention and that the 8-pointed star had been assembled in stages. Nikitin's appearances in another Wagner opera later in 2012, with the Bavarian State Opera, remain scheduled.

It is part of the Roman Catholic diocese of Charlottetown History Prior to 1870, residents of Lot 11 traveled to St. Anthony parish, Cascumpeque, a journey which involved a ferry crossing and nine miles travel over land, or in winter time, a horse and sleigh ride across the ice. In 1868, under the guidance of their first priest Rev. James Aeneas McDonald (1820- ?), the Catholic settlers of Lot 11 started construction on the church. It was completed in 1873, although by Christmas Eve 1870, construction was far enough advanced that midnight mass was offered on a temporary altar. The name for the church was chosen due to the predominantly Irish pioneer settlement of the area. St. Brigid was a 5th Century Irish saint. In 1914 a sacristy was added to the church. In 1931 the spire was struck by lightning. During the repairs a new copper cross was added. Since 1982 there has been no resident priest. Services are conducted by Fr. Danny Wilson, Pastor of St. Anthony's, Bloomfield, PEI. In 2003 the church was officially recognized as a Registered Historic Place under the Heritage Places Protection Act of Prince Edward Island. Historical Registration Documentation: Located in the Culture and Heritage Division, Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, Charlottetown, PE C1A 7N8 File #: 4310-20/S9 Since 1870 the church has held an annual picnic every summer. Architecture Opening of the new sacristy 1914 The architect was John McLellan, who also designed St. Joachim's Roman Catholic church at Vernon River, PEI and St. Joseph's convent in Charlottetown, PEI . The builder was Jeremiah Dalton. The church has a Gothic Revival style with a central tower capped with an elaborate pointed spire topped with a cross. The roof of the spire has decorative high narrow dormers on each of its four sides. Extensive renovations were made to the building in 1913‚Äì14, when a side vestry was added. The church measures sixty feet in length by thirty feet in width. The walls are 22 feet high. The interior is completely covered in wood paneling. Two stained glass windows decorate the altar, one depicting St. Brigid and one depicting St. Patrick.

He is also a member of the Italian hip-hop collective TruceKlan.  Biography  = Beginnings, first crews and Non dormire (1996‚Äì2005) = As a teenager he began playing basketball and cultivating a passion for Nike and graffiti so he joined the TBF crew and Savage Boys. He began his career in a grindcore group together with Metal Carter, but soon realized that his path was that of hip-hop. He entered the world of rap at 19 in the crew Erreaccanegativo, founded by Darko Fetz and Ricky Jd. They released their first album Calma apparente in 1996, but Noyz did not take part in it as he left the crew. Later in 2000 he worked with Truceboys in the creation of their first EP. He then joined the Roman crew on a permanent basis, contributing to the creation and release of the album Sangue in 2003. The next period, in which the members of the group took on solo careers after the creation of the collective Truceklan, was very positive for Noyz. In July 2005 he released his first solo album entitled Non dormire, disc of 16 tracks in which TruceBoys worked together with other artists of the Roman scene. = La calda notte with Chicoria and Verano zombie (2006‚Äì2007) = Shortly after, Noyz Narcos collaborated with Chicoria (from the project In The Panchine) and they published together La calda notte in October 2006. The album, released by Traffik Records, consisted of a CD containing 13 tracks with collaborations with Truceklan artists and a DVD containing live performances of Truceklan. A music video was never broadcast on TV for its explicitly pornographic content. In 2007 Noyz Narcos published Verano zombie, an album in which the instrumental sounds of Non dormire are set aside to move to the equally aggressive beat, but not array of guitar. In the album Metal Carter, Gel, Cole, Mystic One, Duke Montana, Chicoria, collaborated with members of the Truceklan, Danno from Colle Der Fomento, Gue Pequeno, Marracash and Vincenzo da Via Anfossi of Dogo Gang. In the same year, together with representatives of Truceklan and Hawk Nelson Noyz played a part in Mucchio selvaggio, a porn film that has become a cult for fans of Hip Hop. = Ministero dell'inferno and the collaboration with DJ Gengis (2008‚Äì2009) = The Ministero dell'inferno collection was released in March 2008, starring the TruceKlan supported by several well-known names of the Italian hip hop scene like Club Dogo, Kaos One, Santo Trafficante, Fabri Fibra, Gente de Borgata, Danno from Colle Der Fomento, and names totally detached from hip hop context: Cripple Bastards, Miss Violetta Beauregarde and Pinta Facile. The atypical nature of the collaboration, the use of samples from the soundtracks of a certain genre film, the dark atmospheres and the dark beats, lyrics focusing exclusively on existential malaise, urban decay, horrific imagery, faced with cruelty, cynicism and total disenchantment wanted to be a breaking point compared to all the Italian rap compilations released until then. The production of the beats was headed by Lou Chano, Fuzzy, Rough, Don Joe, Noyz Narcos, C.U.N.S., Giordy Beat, DJ Gengis Khan. In addition, he starred with Chicoria, Duke Montana and Cole in the short film Ganja Fiction. In the same year the mixtape The Best Out Mixtape was released, produced by DJ Genghis Khan. The album saw the participation of many Italian MC and was a great success so as to make it necessary to build a second volume, issued in June 2009. = Guilty and B.B.C. with Metal Carter and Duke Montana (2009‚Äì2011) = On the morning of September 18, 2009 during a drug raid called La calda notte Noyz Narcos was detained without being arrested. On January 29, 2010 Noyz Narcos released his third studio album Guilty, anticipated by video clips for the songs M3 and Mosche nere, respectively published on November 1, 2009 and January 11, 2010. The album includes collaborations with leading members of the Italian rap scene with Club Dogo, Marracash, Fabri Fibra and many others. In 2011, Noyz Narcos, Metal Carter and Duke Montana founded the BBC (an acronym for \\"Black Bandana Click\\"). The first project was supposed to be the album Klan Related, but after the publication of the video of Metal Carter (Undead), Duke Montana (Anthem) and Noyz Narcos (Drag You to Hell) the project failed due to disagreements between Noyz and Duke and the three tracks are collected in the EP BBC Project Single. = The Best of the Beast Tour (2011‚Äì2012) = On October 15, 2011 Noyz Narcos participated in the \\"HitWeek Festival\\" in Miami, together with artists like Caparezza and Casino Royale. After returning from America Noyz started his new tour called The Best of The Beast organized by Live Nation, Propaganda Agency and Propapromoz. The tour was created to announce his upcoming album titled Monster originally planned for 2012 and left October 31 from Novara ending December 26 in Cagliari, included 12 dates in the major clubs in Italy.

UK news site MadeLoud.com wrote \\"Unlike the constant building of Explosions in the Sky, who always seem to be reaching higher towards some epic peak, Motif stays decidedly still. The band carves out a stable location and ventures away from it in tentative excursions, only to retrace their footsteps back to the start once again. Gone is the tension and release formula that so much post- rock relies on, replaced instead by a repetitive cycle that invokes comfort and familiarity.\\" MadeLoud.com review 2009-11-29 Alex Woodward at RockARolla Magazine wrote: \\"For the most part, Hearts No Static avoid the more worthy bombast of their many contemporaries, in favor of an even more beautiful lower key take, with shades of Tortoise and Do Make Say Think's jazz inflections and a subtle, majestic ambient yearning, proving that there's still life in the old post-rock yet.\\" Bureau B band site with quotes and reviews In 2012 drummer Jens Pettersson quit the band and guitarist John Roger Olsson switched from guitar to drums and Mikko Singh from Will Gambola Sing/Haleiwa was announced as the new guitarist.It's a Trap! news update 2012-06-19  Recent activity  *Music news blog It's a Trap! reported in June, 2012 that HNS is working on a new album.

Fixity checking is the process of verifying that a digital object has not been altered or corrupted. During transfer, a repository may run a fixity check to ensure a transmitted file has not been altered en route. Within the repository, fixity checking is used to ensure that digital files have not been affected by data rot or other digital preservation dangers. By itself, fixity checking does not ensure the preservation of a digital file. Instead, it allows a repository to identify which corrupted files to replace with a clean copy from the producer or from a backup. In practice, a fixity check is most often accomplished by computing checksum or cryptographic hash function values for a file and comparing them to a stored value or through digital signatures. File fixity figures prominently in Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), the Government Printing Office's work on the Authenticity of Electronic Federal Government Publications, and fixity checking practices are used by a range of cultural heritage organizations.

He died in hospital three days later, the seventh death in the Bahraini uprising. Buhmaid was among a group of protesters who on 18 February marched toward the Pearl Roundabout following the funeral procession of protester Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed four days earlier. When the protesters neared Pearl Roundabout, the army opened fire. Buhmaid collapsed to the ground, and blood poured from his head after it was hit by a bullet. The army opened fire twice more. Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. Riot police finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously. Buhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February. Several witnesses including journalists and medics accused authorities of shooting directly at protesters, preventing some ambulances from reaching the site and firing at others. The government however, denied those statements. It stated that warning shots were fired in the air and accused protesters of faking injuries. An investigation by a government- appointed commission of inquiry blamed the army for Buhmaid's death. The incident marked the first time that the Royal Bahraini Army was used to confront civilians, and at the time was considered \\"the bloodiest\\" incident since protests erupted. Following the incident, the government offered dialogue which the opposition said they will only take part in after the withdrawal of the army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness. Short biography Buhmaid (or Buhamaid, 28) was married and had three children.

An irritated Montalbano phones her and she calmly tells him that she won't have time to attend the funeral and that, to say it plainly, she will in fact seize this unique opportunity, his death, to extricate herself from an overlong relationship and look for pastures new. A loud noise wakes Montalbano, caused by the stormy sea. The sea and the port of Vigata become the setting of Montalbano's new investigation, involving two vessels moored side by side at the Vigata docks: a powerful speedboat and the \\"Vanna\\", a luxury yacht whose crew has found a dinghy at sea carrying a disfigured man killed by poison.

The station has operated since prior to 1898. In December of that year a station employee, Mr William Pead, was attacked by two Aboriginal men. Pead drew his revolver and fired a shot in the air and one of the mean threw a waddy at him hitting him in the arm causing him to drop his revolver. The other then threw a spear at him which also hit him in the arm causing Pead to flee. The owners of the station took each other to court in 1910 over a dispute arising from the sale of the property. The agreement struck in 1905 between Charles Robert Heppingstone and Robert John Stewart regarding the sale of the property including all improvements and stock resulted in Heppingstone suing Stewart for breach of contract. The complicated dispute made it to the Supreme Court and was heard by Justice Rooth. Rooth found in favour of Stewart, but described both of the men as being questionable witnesses. In 1923 the station was sold to Mr T. H. Pearse of Gums Station near Burra, South Australia. Pearse also took up the lease of neighbouring Yundamindera Station to have a total holding of about . Pearse then stocked the station with sheep imported from South Australia which thrived in the area resulting in heavy lambing in 1924. The station was placed on the market again by the Yundamindera Pastoral Company in 1925. Being put up for auction in Perth the property the lease of which would expire in 1948.

It is designated Site C-52C. History With the onset of World War II, the Eglin Field military reservation was greatly expanded when the Choctawhatchee National Forest was turned over to the War Department by the U.S. Forestry Service on 18 October 1940, and a series of auxiliary airfields were constructed from January 1941. The history of the Field is largely unknown, although the runways are pockmarked with craters and patches. Those are likely from either bombs or explosive charges being detonated, with civil engineering rapid runway repair teams using them for training. =Current status= The airfield was incorporated into Eglin AFB on 9 October 1959 and was inactivated. However, the airfield remains under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) as part of the active Eglin base and is not accessible to the public. Baldsiefen is located in an area of the Eglin base called Range 52. It is currently used for training involving rough field landings & takeoffs, cargo extractions, air assault landings & parachute drops. It appears to be used as part of the Eglin target range, as aircraft airframes are visible from time to time on the ramp, likely used for ground targets. Current (2012) imagery shows two F-15s, two F-4s, an A-4 and a propeller-driven aircraft on the ramp, with one F-15 sitting out between the runways. There also appears to be a vehicle R&M; yard south of the airfield, along with a radio relay facility which is staffed by Eglin personnel.

Approximately 120 people were in the club at that time. The nightclub, which was located in the basement of the building, had no central gas connection. A club administrator stated that the nightclub was heated with non-fuel-burning heating and air conditioning equipment, and therefore could not have caused the explosion. The police hypothesis was that the explosion occurred due to accumulation of combustible gases coming not from the club, but from a nearby house. According to investigators, 7 young women were smoking in the club's bathroom, which triggered the explosion.\\"21 de persoane au fost rƒÉnite √Æn cele douƒÉ explozii de la Sighet. 17 oameni au fost spitaliza≈£i √Æn stare gravƒÉ.

Written by series creator Vince Gilligan and directed by Michelle MacLaren, it originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 22, 2012\\\\. \\"Madrigal\\" was seen by an estimated 2.29 million American household viewers. It received highly positive reviews from critics, with one citing it as an example of great artistic directing in a television series.  Plot  In Hannover, Germany, Peter Schuler, an executive for Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, the parent company of Los Pollos Hermanos, kills himself with a portable defibrillator after police arrive to question him about his longstanding ties to Gus. Back in Albuquerque, Jesse panics over the missing ricin cigarette, worried that someone will find it and get poisoned. Walt hides the vial of ricin behind an electrical outlet cover in his house and creates a fake one, planting it in Jesse's Roomba when he helps search Jesse's house. Jesse finds it and tearfully laments what he believes is his own stupidity, apologizing to Walt for suspecting him of poisoning Brock. Walt and Jesse offer Mike an equal, three-way partnership in a new meth operation. Mike refuses, explaining that Walt is a dangerous \\"time bomb\\". Saul suggests that with Gus eliminated, Walt can safely and cleanly quit the drug trade. However, Walt justifies rebooting the meth business by claiming that it is a golden opportunity that he cannot afford to leave behind, since he is actually $40,000 in debt after Skyler gave over $600,000 to Ted, and paid for Hank's physical therapy. But the main obstacle to Walt and Jesse's comeback plan is the need for a new source of methylamine, the precursor to their premium-grade version of meth. Meanwhile, Hank takes part in a meeting between the DEA and Madrigal's CEO, who claims Schuler was a lone criminal within the company and promises full cooperation. Hank's boss, ASAC George Merkert, reveals that he is being forced out of his job as symbolic punishment by his superiors for failing to heed Hank's warnings about Gus. Merkert reflects on his friendship with Gus and wonders aloud who else might be leading a double life, which eventually seems to suddenly strike a chord with Hank. A Houston-based Madrigal executive named Lydia Rodarte-Quayle asks Mike to kill eleven men from Gus's operation in order to tie up loose ends. Mike refuses, as Gus paid them enough to keep quiet. However, when he is called in to meet with Hank and Gomez, Mike learns the authorities have seized all of the offshore accounts Gus had set up for key underlings in his meth operation. Mike is affected as well, since his account (set up in his 10-year-old granddaughter's name) was worth $2 million. On Mike's way into his interview at the DEA offices, he runs into a visibly- scared Duane Chow‚ÄîGus' methylamine supplier‚Äîwho was just leaving his own DEA interview. Later, Chow invites Mike to his home to discuss their shared problem with the police. Mike correctly suspects that it is a set-up and gets the jump on Chris, one of his former men, who has already killed Chow. Chris explains that Lydia had contracted him to kill everyone after Mike refused, as he needs the money. Mike kills Chris and later breaks into Lydia's house in Houston. As he is about to execute her, Lydia's panicked pleas about her daughter affect him. He decides to spare Lydia in exchange for her becoming Walt's new methylamine supplier. Mike calls Walt and accepts a partnership in the new meth operation. Skyler has become paralyzed by feelings of overwhelming fear and helplessness at the type of person Walt has become. Walt joins Skyler in bed for the night, gently explaining why it's for the best that she accept the new phase their lives have entered, and again hints at remorse for what happened to Ted. Even though her back is still facing him, Walt continues to reassure Skyler on how things are much better than she thinks they are‚Äîwhile escalating sexual foreplay on her. Looking anxious, lost, and perhaps on the verge of some kind of outcry, Skyler remains completely quiet as the scene suddenly cuts to black.  Production  Breaking Bad creator and episode writer Vince Gilligan spoke about opening the episode at Madrigal: \\"We always like to surprise our viewers, and the idea of suddenly opening in Germany seemed like fun. We also wanted to start showing you the business of Madrigal, the company that financed Gus Fring. Is Madrigal all corrupt? Or was it just a couple of executives?\\" However, all actors speaking German in the opening scene display a strong English accent, implying none of them are native speakers. He also spoke about Jonathan Banks, who was the main focus of the episode, and Mike's evolving over the series: \\"It‚Äôs a testament to the great actors on this show ‚Äì Aaron Paul, Dean Norris who plays Hank ‚Äì that those characters became more important over time. Jonathan Banks is just fantastic in the role.\\" When asked if Mike was watching The Caine Mutiny in the episode, Vince stated: \\"That is The Caine Mutiny, one of my very favorite movies. I was very lucky with that, actually, because it can be very expensive to use clips of movies, which is why you don't see too many clips on the show. But Caine Mutiny is owned by Sony/Columbia, our parent company. And yes, it may have some connection to where Walt is at this point.\\" Several fake restaurant chain names were made for the headquarters of Madrigal. One of these, \\"Burger Matic\\", was actually taken from Gilligan's previous work, Home Fries.  Reception  = Ratings = The episode was watched by approximately 2.29 million American viewers on its original broadcast, down from its series-high ratings of 2.93 million viewers the previous week. = Critical reception = The episode received critical acclaim with many critics considering it a step up from the season premiere and praising Jonathan Banks' performance. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called \\"Madrigal\\" \\"terrific\\", stating: \\"One of the methods to Breaking Bads endless fascination is the way it unfurls maps of inter-dependence. Certain characters may like to see themselves as independent agents, as lone wolves, but everyone is dependent upon someone else ‚Äì someone else's errors, or rare twinge of good conscience ‚Äì and thus must remain part of a group. It's a braided metaphor for the reasons we form societies.\\" He did, however, wish the episode ended \\"more forcefully\\" with Mike making the reluctant phone call to Walt, rather than ending with the Walt/Skyler bedroom scene. TV Fanatics Matt Richenthal gave the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars, commenting: \\"Through its attention to detail, direction and dialogue, Breaking Bad possesses an uncanny ability to enrapture and enthrall. You can't help but be invested in every moment.\\" He also commented on Jonathan Banks' performance: \\"Overall, just a terrific showcase this week for Jonathan Banks. His portrayal of Mike paints the picture of an exasperated career criminal who excels at the game ... and is resigned to his fate. He's funny ... and he somehow manages to be the moral center of this operation, despite his willingness to kill and kill and kill.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture cited the episode as an example of great directing in television, stating that it \\"contained not a single dull shot\\" and is stylistically reminiscent of Alan J. Pakula's thriller films through Michelle MacLaren's \\"sense of space, light, and pacing\\". In 2019 The Ringer ranked \\"Madrigal\\" as the 37th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.

In popular reference, Kabbalah has been used to refer to the whole history of Jewish mysticism, but more accurately, and as used in academic Jewish studies, Kabbalah refers to the doctrines, practices and esoteric exegetical method in Torah, that emerged in 12th-13th century Southern France and Spain, and was developed further in 16th century Ottoman Palestine. These formed the basis of subsequent Jewish mystical development. This is a partial list of Jewish Kabbalists; secondary literature incorporating Kabbalah is enormous, particularly in the voluminous library of Hasidic Judaism that turned esoteric Kabbalah into a popular revivalist movement. Hasidism both adapted Kabbalah to its own internalised psychological concern, and also continued the development of the Jewish mystical tradition. Therefore, only formative articulators of Hasidic thought, or particularly Kabbalistic schools/authors in Hasidism are included here. In the Sabbatean mystical heresy that broke away from Judaism, only the founders are listed. Solely academic-university Jewish studies researchers of Jewish mysticism, not being \\"Kabbalists\\", nor necessarily Jewish, are not listed here; nor are separate non-Jewish derivative/syncretic traditions of Kabbalah. Rabbinic figures in Judaism are often known after the name of their magnum opus, or as Hebrew acronyms based on their name, preceded by R for Rabbi/Rav.

It also chooses coaches for the national team (presently Cyrus Poncha and Major S. Maniam). The rise of squash worldwide with many players in the top 100 worldwide and India's higher rankings worldwide are a testament to the hard work put in by the administrators and players over the last decade. Among the major facilities created by the SRFI is the Indian Squash Academy,Cyrus Poncha blog which hosted the World Team Championship in 2007.http://wmt2007.com/press.htm Conflict between the SRFI and squash athletes came to a fore in 2005, when the government was conferring the Dronacharya Award on SRFI affiliated squash coach Cyrus Poncha. India's number one squash player Joshna Chinappa wrote a letter to the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs that she never trained under Poncha, and that he had misused her name to get the Dronacharya Award. The SRFI chairman Ramachandran then produced testimonials from Joshna where she acknowledges the support of SRFI and Poncha. In 2008, the SRFI chose a woman's squad for the Asian championships without Dipika Pallikal, who was then training in Egypt, after having recently won the under-17 British Open. The federation cited irregularities in the paperwork in informing the group about her absence due to training, but it was felt that this might have been a rivalry with the Mittal Champions Trust which had been sponsoring her training abroad. The SRFI maintains the website, Indiasquash.com which announces the national squash calendar and other details.  Activities  The various activities conducted by the SRFI during the year include: * Coaching camps * Tournaments (national and international) * Daily training at the Indian Squash Academy * Referee clinics * Participates in international competitions * Level 1, 2 & 3 coaching courses * Development activities at tier 2 and 3 cities Rise of Indian squash Postings In February 2015, the federation appointed Harish Prasad as the national development officer.

Harish has been instrumental in implementing various initiatives for the development of the game. In June 2015, Debendranath Sarangi and K Rajendiran were elected unopposed as president and secretary-general respectively of the Squash Rackets Federation of India at its Extraordinary General Meeting. In July 2016, Egyptian coach Ashraf el Karagui was appointed by the Sports Authority of India to serve Indian squash. Within a short span he has made significant difference to the junior and senior players. Currently India's top two players, Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal Karthik train with Ashraf and praise him for the changes he has brought to their game.

The school was a twin project of Sto. Rosario Parish as the priest believes that a formal program of religious instruction to the youth of Toril was complementary to their task of evangelization. Father Jean Bernard Bazinet, P.M.E. was the first parish priest and the first school director. The first school enrollment consisted of first, second, and third year high school levels and so in 1950,the school first produced its first thirty two (32) high school graduates. Realizing, an urgent need for a more permanent management of the school, Msgr. Clovis Thibault, Bishop of Davao offered the administration of the school to the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary (PM). The offer was accepted in 1952 but the PM Sisters arrived in Toril only on May 25, 1953. Sr. Marie de Anges became the principal and at that point, the name of the school was changed to Saint Peter's College of Daliaon. In 1963, the primary grades and the college department were opened. Courses offered were AB, BSE, and BSC. In 1977, the two-year Junior Secretarial course was offered but was closed in 1996. The following year, the intermediate grades were also opened. In 1978, preschool education or kindergarten was offered. In 2001, BEED was offered and in 2007 the BSBA course. SPCT Rivier Building At the very start, the school consisted only of a two-story building with eight (8) rooms and gradually other buildings were constructed; significantly in 1986, the Rivier Building; in 1995, the science building was donated by the Alumni; in 1998,the school gymnasium; in 2002-2003 the John Vianney Building and the latest was the Presentation de Marie Building in 2009. On November 23, 1989, the name of the school was changed to Saint Peter's College of Toril(SPCT) and as the school administrators continued to explore ways to upgrade school standards, the grade school and high school applied for PAASCU (Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools Colleges and Universities) in 1990. Presently both departments, the elementary and high school are PAASCU Accredited-Level II.

Using this tool, it is possible to freeze a running application (or part of it) and checkpoint it to persistent storage as a collection of files. One can then use the files to restore and run the application from the point it was frozen at. The distinctive feature of the CRIU project is that it is mainly implemented in user space, rather than in the kernel. The project is currently under active development, with monthly release cycle for stable releases.https://criu.org/Release_schedule  History  The initial version of CRIU software was presented to the Linux developers community by Pavel Emelyanov, the OpenVZ kernel team leader, on 15 July 2011. In September 2011, the project was presented at the Linux Plumbers Conference. In general, most of the attendees took a positive view of the project, which is proven by the fact that a number of kernel patches required for implementing the project were included in the mainline kernel. Andrew Morton, however, was a bit skeptical:  Use  The CRIU tool is being developed as part of the OpenVZ project, with the aim of replacing the in-kernel checkpoint/restore. Though its main focus is to support the migration of containers, allowing users to check-point and restore the current state of running processes and process groups. The tool can currently be used on x86-64 and ARM systems and supports the following features: * Processes: their hierarchy, PIDs, user and group authenticators (UID, GID, SID, etc.), system capabilities, threads, and running and stopped states * Application memory: memory-mapped files and shared memory * Open files * Pipes and FIFOs * Unix domain sockets * Network sockets, including TCP sockets in ESTABLISHED state (see below) * System V IPC * Timers * Signals * Terminals * Linux kernel- specific system calls: \`inotify\`, \`signalfd\`, \`eventfd\` and \`epoll\` , no kernel patching is required because all of the required functionality has already been merged into the Linux kernel mainline since kernel version 3.11, which was released on September 2, 2013.  TCP connection migration  One of the initial project goals was to support the migration of TCP connections, the biggest challenge being to suspend and then restore only one side of a connection. This was necessary for performing the live migration of containers (along with all their active network connections) between physical servers, the main scenario of using the checkpoint/restore feature in OpenVZ. To cope with this problem, a new feature, \\"TCP repair mode\\", was implemented. The feature was included in version 3.5 of the Linux kernel mainline and provides users with additional means to disassemble and reconstruct TCP sockets without the necessity of exchanging network packets with the opposite side of the connection.

WRF promotes resource productivity among researchers, policymakers, business, NGOs and the public. In addition to organizing international and regional conferences, the WRF Secretariat coordinates multistakeholder dialogue projects, amongst others the Sustainable Recycling Initiative (SRI) as well as the H2020 projects Towards a World Forum on Raw Materials (FORAM), and CEWASTE. The WRF contributes to other EC-projects (like CICERONE and RE:SOURCE) and projects with the German development organisation GiZ, UNEP and UNIDO. WRF serves as a platform fostering knowledge exchange between academics, politicians, research-oriented practitioners, entrepreneurs, consultants and other professionals in the areas of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) (sustainable development.) About the organisation WRF Headquarters at Empa in St. Gallen, SwitzerlandThe WRF aims to bring the issues of global resource consumption and resource productivity higher on the agenda of policymakers and business leaders. Aspects covered by the WRF include the scarcity and security of supply as well as the price risks of key resources. The issues of pollution and energy use over the life-cycle of certain resources, their social impact ‚Äì in particular in developing countries ‚Äì and in general the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are topics examined by the WRF as well. Organisational structure of the World Resources ForumAs an inter-link between research, industry and policymaking, WRF emphasises the facilitation of networking in order to optimise the transfer of knowledge between the different stakeholders. For that purpose, special events are organised and connections to key leaders can be established through the WRF Secretariat. The WRF capacity building activities include, for instance, supporting the participation of scientists from developing countries and of young people (for example the youth programme of the 2011 WRF Conference) and Kids and yWRF program of WRF 2013. Flagship activity is the organisation of the annual WRF Conference, which usually takes place in the fall and brings together science, research, policymakers and industry. The programme usually includes a series of high-level keynotes, parallel sessions and targeted workshops as well as special side events. Apart from the regular media reports are regularly being written by Student Reporters. Furthermore, the WRF Secretariat conducts other knowledge and multi-stakeholder dialogue as well, such as the dissemination of UN Environment International Resource Panel reports though website, social media and MOOCs. The Corporate image of the World Resources Forum was designed by Helmut Langer. It shows a white R in a blue world which symbolizes not only the resource issue but also associations like Refusing, Reducing, Re-using, Repairing, Refurbishing, Remanufacturing, Re-purposing, Recycling and Recovering. Logo of the World Resources Forum as of 2015 = Organisational structure = The WRF is a non-for-profit association, with a General Assembly and Board. The WRF Secretariat, based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, is responsible for the coordination and organisation of multiple activities. Founding members are the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, the Swiss interdisciplinary research institution and service provider for materials science and technology Empa, the United Nations Environment International Resource Panel, Hewlett-Packard, and the city of St. Gallen. Other members have included the German Federal Environment Agency, the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences, the Rhomberg Group, the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), the Mercator Foundation Switzerland, the Association for Quality and Management Systems (SQS), the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Foundation for Rare Metals ESM, the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences (SATW) and the Finnish Innovation Fund SITRA. = History = The Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Empa, part of the ETH Domain, has organised international conferences on recycling and re-use of resources since 1995, the so-called \\"R\\"series (R‚Äô93, R‚Äô95 etc). R referred to reduce, reuse and recycle. In 2009 Empa together with the Factor 10 Institute decided to broaden the scope of the conferences to include the full life-cycle of products and services. And so the series of conferences became the World Resources Forum, which has been attracting high-level politicians, business leaders, NGOs and scientists from all over the world ever since. In 2009 the WRF Conference was organised in Davos, Switzerland, back to back with the R‚Äô09 Twin World Congress on Resource Management and Technology for Material and Energy Efficiency. The R‚Äô Conferences got entirely integrated into the WRF and in 2011 the enlarged WRF Conference took place again in Davos, followed by annual flagship meetings in Switzerland and beyond (see next chapter). The spin-off of the Secretariat from Empa and inauguration of the independent WRF Association took place on 16 March 2012 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, with support from governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as the private sector. Bas de Leeuw (former UN Environment) became its first Managing Director, and Xaver Edelmann (former Empa) its first President. Former FOEN (Federal Office for the Environment) Director Bruno Oberle was elected President in 2018, Xaver Edelmann stayed on as Vice-President. Bas de Leeuw was elected full member of the Club of Rome in 2017. = Vision and mission = WRF envisions the world where influential decision-makers, established civil societies, key industrial players, leading scientists and the empowered public interact and communicate on setting the agenda and developing solutions on sustainable use of resources worldwide, paying close attention to the delicate interplay between the economic, social and environmental implications of resource use as well as acknowledging the challenges of increasing pressure on available resources. Through this interaction of multiple stakeholders, innovative and effective solutions emerge, addressing the issue of efficiency and sufficiency of resource utilization amongst consumers, producers and waste management sector, establishing sustainable practices of resources use worldwide. The World Resources Forum aims to make their vision of sustainable use of resources worldwide a reality through organization of high-level international conferences and capacity-building workshops, dissemination of relevant research findings and scientific discussions, development of resource efficiency indices, setting standards for sustainable resource use, creation of opportunities for financing resource efficiency projects as well as through engagement with young leaders and the wider public. WRF is committed to the inclusiveness of economic growth and elimination of poverty and marginalization, thus making these issues a core element in any objectives we pursue. Conferences  Flagship activity of the World Resources Forum is the organisation of the annual WRF Conference, which brings together science, research, policymakers and industry. The programme includes a series of high- level keynotes, parallel sessions and targeted workshops as well as special side events. The program normally also include WRF Cinema, WRF Art Gallery, WRF Workshop Parade and WRF Gala Dinner. The Workshop Parade format was shortlisted for the Audience Interaction Award by the Meeting Design Institute at the multi-hub FRESH 2018 conference. The World Resources Forum Secretariat also organizes regional conferences such as the Asia-Pacific Resources Forum, and the Latin America and the Caribbean Resources Forum, and it contributes to the bi-annual European Resources Forum, held in Berlin, organised by the German Federal Environment Agency UBA. In 2016 the first Swiss Resources Forum, focusing on resources issues within Switzerland, was organised in the NEST, Empa's Innovation Hub in Dubendorf, Zurich. =WRF 2020= WRF 2020 was scheduled to be held in Accra, Ghana, in June 2020, so announced the Minister of Environment, Science, Technology, and Innovation of Ghana, H.E.

The forum has focused on showcasing circular economy solutions for business, cities and finance and attracted 1500 participants from 105 countries. Overall conclusion of the WCEF was that the business case for Circular Economy does not have to be made, but that many countries and businesses are already leading the way. =Swiss Resources Forum 2016= Logo of the Swiss Resources ForumThe WRF organized together with other stakeholders a resource forum focusing on Switzerland. The conference brought together over 100 participants from industry as well as policymakers and researchers. It focused on the supply of critical metals and other resources needed for renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, innovation and economic growth. The main outcome stated that Switzerland not only needs an Energy Revolution (away from fossil fuels) but also a Resource Revolution. =WRF LAC 2016= The World Resources Forum Latin America and the Caribbean was held in San Jos√©, Costa Rica in conjunction with the International Sustainable Building Congress, organised by the Green Building Council Costa Rica, WRF and UNEP. About 380 participants from 30 countries focused on the key topics of sustainable business and financing; bio economy ‚Äì priority resources for cities; sustainable lifestyles and education; resource efficiency policies for sustainable cities and lifestyles; sustainable and inclusive cities and buildings. The meeting report was published in 2016. =WRF 2015= World Resources Forum 2015 was held in Davos, Switzerland, from 11‚Äì14 October 2015, and had over 600 participants coming from 108 countries. Discussed topics included Circular Economy and Decoupling; technological innovation, business and finance; targets, indicators, and benchmarks for resource use as well as lifestyles and education. One of the main outcomes of the conference was that there is a strong need for reliable and comprehensive indicators and benchmarks that could produce meaningful data to set targets and goals for policymakers in the field of resource management. The meeting report was published in 2015. =WRF Asia-Pacific 2015= World Resources Forum Asia- Pacific was held in Sydney, Australia, from 1‚Äì3 June 2015, and attracted close to 300 participants. An Action Agenda on Resource Productivity and Innovation was launched by the Institute for Sustainable Futures of the University of Technology (UTS) and the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology at UNSW Australia. The chairman‚Äôs summary was published in 2015. Key themes discussed during the conference were Resource Productivity in the Asia‚ÄêPacific, Enabling Transition Pathways and Innovation through Collaboration. =WRF 2014= World Resources Forum 2014 was held in Arequipa, Peru, from 19‚Äì22 October 2014 and attracted over 1,000 participants coming from 40 countries and international organisations.

The meeting report was published in 2015. =WRF 2013= World Resources Forum 2013 was held in Davos, Switzerland, 6‚Äì9 October 2013 and attracted over 400 participants from 53 countries and international organisations. Main conference topics at WRF 2013 were Resource Efficiency and Governance, Sustainable Business and Industry, Sustainable Cities and Infrastructure, and Lifestyles and Education. The conference included plenary speeches by leading experts such as Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker, as well as debates featuring Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, Reinhard B√ºtikofer and H.R.H. Prince Jaime of Bourbon-Parma. The meeting report was published in 2013. A video with conference highlights was published by UBrainTV. =WRF 2012= World Resources Forum 2012 was held from 21‚Äì23 October at the China National Convention Center in Beijing, China, and attracted over 700 participants. Main theme of this forum, co-organised with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was Resources and Green Economy. The outcome of the conference stated that scarcity of resources, increasing prices, and unsustainable use of resources do hinder economic development and therefore pose risks for global stability. The meeting report was published in 2012. =WRF 2011= More than 400 participants from over 40 countries and international organisations attended the World Resources Forum 2011 in Davos, Switzerland, from 19‚Äì21 September 2011. The results from the conference were documented in a meeting report and were submitted to the Rio+20 Earth Summit's compilation document, as well as other stakeholders, such as the International Monetary Fund. The Swiss government adopted the recommendations and integrated these in their statements in Rio. Topics discussed at the conference included the Security of Supply; Assessment Methods, Resource Use Indicators and Targets; the Social Dimension of Resources as well as communication and education. The meeting report was published in 2011. =WRF 2009= The R'09 conference on resource management and technology for material and energy efficiency was run simultaneously in Davos and Nagoya from 14 to 16 September 2009. The main goal of the ninth event in the R' World Congress series was to promote technologies and frameworks for enhancing the material and energy efficiency of products, services and processes (from production and use to recycling), including developing sustainable solutions for tackling the growing mountain of e-waste. The conference was organized by Empa in cooperation with the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences, the EcoTopia Science Institute of the University of Nagoya, and the Factor 10 Institute. For the first time, that year's conference was followed by the World Resources Forum, where politicians and scientists had the opportunity to discuss new economic frameworks promoting the sustainable use of resources. The innovative two site conference concept saved considerable amounts of CO2, so the conclusion of a scientific paper, published in Elsevier's Telematics and Informatics Journal. At the Davos meeting, WRF attendees adopted a declaration that calls for western economies to massively reduce their material inputs and for the world to dramatically increase resource productivity. They also agreed that, because the price of natural resources is low compared to that of labour, industry will not purposely drive those changes. Only governments can provide the necessary framework and incentives. Key projects The World Resources Forum Secretariat coordinates and has the project lead for various programs. They range from development cooperation projects to more governance oriented initiatives. =Sustainable Recycling Industries= SRI LogoThe Sustainable Recycling Industries (SRI) program builds capacity for sustainable recycling in developing countries. The program is funded by the Swiss State Secretariat of Economic Affairs and is implemented by the Empa, WRF and ecoinvent. It builds on the success of implementing e-waste recycling systems together with various developing countries for more than ten years. The SRI programme attempts to attain three objectives. First, it develops basic data for the assessment of environmental and social life cycle performance for industrial activities through the improvement of local and regional expertise in Brazil, India and South Africa. Furthermore, SRI improves local capacity for sustainable recycling together with private and public institutions, as well as the informal sector in Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Peru, and South Africa. Lastly, the program facilitates a stakeholder consultation for the development of sustainability criteria for secondary raw materials. This has resulted in the ISO International Workshop Agreement on the ‚ÄòGuidance Principles for the Sustainable Management of Secondary Metals' (ISO IWA 19:2017), which was launched at the Thirteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention. This new ISO document aims to guide economic operators of secondary metals value chains, including the informal sector, in the efficient and credible implementation of improved recycling practices, in particular in emerging and developing economies. The video \\"Tales of Trash: 5 Principles for Inclusive Recycling\\" introduces the program in just 3,5 minutes. =CEWASTE= CEWASTE is a two-year project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. It will develop a voluntary certification scheme for waste treatment. Specifically, the CEWASTE project will create, validate and launch the scheme for collection, transport and treatment facilities of key types of waste containing significant amounts of valuable and critical raw materials such as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and batteries. The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. =CICERONE= CICERONE is building a joint platform for efficient circular economy programming. If our societies are to make the switch to circular practices, all actors need to be involved and actively commit to transitioning a more sustainable economy. This is why CICERONE works in close cooperation with a variety of practitioners including government bodies, research & technology organisations, civil society, industry, innovative SMEs, startups, cities and investors. The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. =RE-SOURCING= The project will set up a Global Stakeholder Platform for Responsible Sourcing (RS). This platform is expected to facilitate the development of a globally accepted definition of RS and develop ideas for incentives facilitating responsible business conduct in the EU, enable exchange of stakeholders for information exchange and promotion, foster the emergence of RS in international political fora, and to support the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials. The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. =FORAM= FORAM LogoThe project Towards a World Forum on Raw Materials (FORAM) developed and set up an EU-based platform of international experts and stakeholders, advancing the international cooperation on raw material policies and investments. The platform works together on making the current complex maze of existing raw material related initiatives more effective. As such, the FORAM project is said to be the largest collaborative effort for raw materials strategy cooperation on a global level so date. The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The global use of mineral resources has drastically increased and supply chains have become ever more complex. Several global initiatives and organizations have been contributing to knowledge and information transfer, including the European Commission, the European Geological Survey, the European Federation of Geologists, UNEP International Resource Panel, the World Resources Forum, the World Materials Forum, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and others. It is widely felt that improved international resource transparency and governance would be beneficial for all, since it would lead to stability, predictability, resource-efficiency and hence a better foundation for competitiveness on a sustainable basis. FORAM 18 - the pilot event of the project - was organised on 27 June 2018 in Nancy, France, back-to-back with the World Materials Forum. Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, Member of the European Parliament, was one of the keynote speakers. Launching and preparatory events have been held in Brussels during Raw Materials Week, and Geneva, as part of the World Resources Forum 2017. =Providing e-learning platforms and webinars= WRF also takes up a leading role in the planning, coordination and production of massive open online courses on issues such as e-waste, resource efficiency and circular economy. Examples are the MOOC on e-waste and the MOCC on decoupling with partners such as UN Environment International Resources Panel, Secretariat of the Basel Convention, Climate-KIC, Stellenbosch University and engageability. =Igniting Business Investments in Resource Efficiency= Igniting Business Investments in Resource-efficiency (IBIRE) developed as part of the United Nations 10 Year Framework Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, aims at boosting private investments in support of the advancement of sustainable lifestyles worldwide, by identifying funding sources and making them aware of promising business innovations, and by facilitating and supporting access of entrepreneurs to the new global markets that serve the emergence of sustainable lifestyles worldwide. Building upon decades of good work on Cleaner Production and related concepts, as well as on development cooperation and innovation programs, the IBIRE program ignites worldwide attention of various types of investors and donors to the business opportunities that the shift to more sustainable lifestyles has to offer. =Other projects and programs= In addition to the dissemination of scientific reports and papers, WRF also funds publications and papers in collaboration with universities and research institutes. In cooperation with Leiden University, WRF published the paper Towards a resource-efficiency index of nations.

It operated the metre-gauge railways among Mannheim, Heidelberg and Weinheim. The company was merged with MVV Verkehr AG (the Mannheim municipal transport company) on 16 March 2010. Until December 2009, the OEG also operated municipal buses in Weinheim, some bus routes in the southeast of Mannheim and several other bus routes in the vicinity of Schriesheim and Ladenburg.  History marks of the Upper Rhine Railway Company AG issued on 10 August 1920 After the death of Hermann Bachstein in 1908, the Rhenish industrialist Hugo Stinnes took over the majority of SEG in 1909 with the aim of taking control of the electric tramways of the Ruhr and other major cities as part of the RWE (Rheinisch-Westf√§lisches Elektrizit√§tswerk AG) power company so that they could be connected to the electric grid of western Germany. In order to focus on electric trams, a few railways were spun off the SEG and transferred to newly established companies. In order to carry out the electrification of the line and to allow the expansion of its tram network, the city of Mannheim in cooperation with the SEG, which had acquired the Mannheim-Weinheim-Heidelberg-Mannheim railway, founded the Oberrheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG (OEG) in 1911. In order to prevent domination by the RWE, the city of Mannheim held a majority of the shares of the company. The Schwetzingen‚ÄìKetsch Tramway (Stra√üenbahn Schwetzingen‚ÄìKetsch) and two power plants in Ladenburg and Rheinau were acquired by the OEG. 51% of the share capital was held by the city of Mannheim and 26% by the SEG. The rest was accounted for by three other shareholders.The OEG took over the operation of the lines on 1 April 1911. To mitigate financial problems after the First World War, the city of Mannheim took over the railways from the OEG, while the company (with retained power plants and electric distribution) remained in the hands of Stinnes and was renamed Kraftwerke Rheinau. The now independent company of Oberrheinische Eisenbahngesellschaft was established by the cities of Mannheim, Heidelberg, Weinheim, Viernheim and the Rhein-Haardtbahn GmbH (Rhine-Haardt Railway, builder of the Bad D√ºrkheim‚ÄìLudwigshafen-Oggersheim railway). The city of Mannheim contributed the railway of the former OEG to the new company. The OEG tram line from Neckarau to Rheinau (then called Rhenaniastra√üe) was opened in 1913. At the time of the line's construction, Rheinau was not yet incorporated in Mannheim and was therefore in the jurisdiction of the OEG according to the existing cooperation agreements. This changed with its incorporation in Mannheim in 1913, so the line was then used by the city's tramway and it passed into its possession in 1921. In 1914, the first section of the Mannheim‚ÄìFeudenheim‚ÄìIlvesheim‚ÄìLadenburg‚ÄìSchriesheim line was opened to Feudenheim for temporary freight traffic. In addition, the line was operated for two months by the city‚Äôs tram services, prior to the commencement of OEG operations. Land on the adjacent section had been purchased and works had commenced (including on bridges) on the remaining route, but work had to be abandoned because of the First World War. Since the construction could not be completed even after the war for economic reasons, the OEG began operating its first bus line on the route in 1925. It was intended to be temporary, awaiting the finishing of the line, but it has continued to this day. The freight traffic to Freudenheim was abandoned along with the line in the late 1920s. Like most transport companies in Germany, the OEG had a huge increase in ridership after the war to cope with, especially in 1945 when only half of its fleet was available. In 1947 patronage reached a peak of 25.6 million passengers. One of the reasons for the increase was the phenomenon of so-called \\"foraging trips\\", when cheap fares encouraged people to barter for food with farmers. Ridership returned to normal after the currency reform of 1948. After overcoming the post-war difficulties, the OEG had to deal with incipient mass motorisation. Its goal was to become faster and more convenient in order to hang on to patronage. A first step was the purchase of four open coaches, together with trailer carriages from Waggonfabrik Fuchs. About 1960, it began improving the technical safety of level crossings with flashing lights, which were later augmented with half- barriers. In 1964, the OEG operated 142 km of tracks and carried more than 50,000 passengers daily. Train radio was introduced in 1976. The funding of the OEG's losses were revised in 1996. Mannheim now funds 58.2%, Rhein-Neckar- Kreis 30%, Heidelberg 7.2% and Viernheim 4.6% of the losses occurring every year. Until then, the city of Heidelberg had paid nothing at all. In addition, in 1996, Weinheimer Busunternehmen GmbH (Weinheim Bus Company, WEBU) was established, owned by Stadtwerke Weinheim GmbH (the Weinheim municipal utility, 71.6%) and OEG (28.4%), that has since managed Weinheim city buses. OEG continued to operate bus services for WEBU until 31 December 2009. In 2000, MVV GmbH acquired a 94.6% share of the OEG from the city of Mannheim and the company was renamed MVV OEG AG. 5.18% remains directly owned by the city of Mannheim, 0.2% by the City of Heidelberg and 0.02% by the City of Weinheim. Since 2002, the OEG network has been operated together with the Mannheim trams of MVV Verkehr AG. Rhine-Neckar Transport (Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr GmbH, RNV), which is jointly owned by MVV OEG AG, MVV Verkehr AG, Stra√üenbahn Heidelberg, Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen and Rhein-Haardtbahn, was founded on 1 October 2004 and it has carried out joint operations since 1 March 2005. The infrastructure and the concessions remain with the OEG, but the rolling stock were transferred to RNV and are considered to form part of the capital contribution to RNV, which now provides transport services on behalf of the OEG. Since 2005, responsibility for funding losses incurred has been allocated to the respective districts of Mannheim, Heidelberg, Viernheim and the Rhein- Neckar-Kreis in proportion to net-kilometres operated. The council of the city of Mannheim decided to merge MVV OEG AG and MVV Verkehr AG in 2009. After acquiring the remaining 0.22% of shares from Heidelberg and Weinheim, Mannheim now holds 100% of the shares. The merger was finalised on 16 March 2010 with the deletion of MVV OEG AG from the share company register. As a next step, MVV Verkehr AG became a limited liability company on 31 March 2011. The company was renamed MV Mannheimer Verkehr GmbH on 2 January 2018. Operated routes The Upper Rhine Railway Company operated the following routes: * Mannheim‚ÄìWeinheim railway * Weinheim‚ÄìHeidelberg railway * Mannheim Kurpfalzbr√ºcke‚ÄìEdingen‚ÄìHeidelberg railway * Mannheim-K√§fertal‚ÄìHeddesheim railway * Mannheim-Seckenheim‚ÄìNeckarhausen‚ÄìEdingen (Baden) railway * Heidelberg-G√ºterbahnhof OEG‚ÄìDossenheim‚ÄìSchriesheim railway  Rolling stock = Steam era= OEG steam locomotive 56, built in 1886, in Technoseum Mannheim Trains were operated on the initially non-electrified lines using small two-axle steam locomotives (some disguised as tram engines) hauling rail carriages. Steam locomotives 56 and 102 are now part of the collection of the Technoseum Mannheim, although only locomotive 56 is publicly exhibited. Locomotive 101 ended up after several intermediate points at the Selfkantbahn, where it is operated as locomotive MEG 101. Furthermore, some passenger cars and numerous freight wagons have been preserved at, for example, DEV Bruchhausen-Vilsen, the Selfkantbahn, the M√§rkische Museum Railway at Plettenberg, the Albb√§hnle (Amstetten‚ÄìOppingen) and the H√§rtsfeld-Museumsbahn in Neresheim. The OEG operated two locomotives similar to the T 3, locomotives 341 and 342, on the standard gauge line to Schriesheim. = Diesel locomotives = The OEG procured three diesel locomotives for metre gauge (designated as 01 to 03) and a diesel locomotive for standard gauge (no. 04) from the manufacturer Gmeinder to replace steam locomotives from 1953. The two-axle locomotives were technically similar to the K√∂f II of DB, but were constructed differently. Until the electrification of the Weinheim‚ÄìSchriesheim section, the metre-gauge locomotives also hauled passenger trains. Later, like their standard-gauge sister locomotive, they were only used for freight and construction traffic. Another diesel locomotive was put into service to replace the last steam locomotive in 1967 as no. 05, which technically and visually had many similarities with a K√∂f III. With the closing of the standard-gauge freight line in 1973, the first diesel locomotives, 04 and 05, were sold. With the decline in freight traffic and the loss of general freight (small consignments) to trucks, it could later do without the two metre-gauge locomotives and it sold locomotive 01 to Essener Verkehrs-AG (the Essen municipal transport company‚Äînow part of Ruhrbahn‚Äîwhich renumbered it 601) and the locomotive 03 to the Rhein-Haardtbahn (renumbered V01). Locomotive 02 was renumbered 350 with the introduction of engineering vehicle numbers in the early 1990s. It is still in service today and is sometimes used as an engineering vehicle or an auxiliary locomotive. = Electric shunting locomotive = The OEG acquired a small two-axle locomotive with a box body, no. 50, from the Nederlandsche Buurtspoorweg-Maatschappij in 1952. The previous owner had converted the locomotive from a steam tram engine, but it had become redundant as a result of the closure of the tramway between Utrecht and Zeist in 1949. The overall condition of the locomotive turned out to be so bad that the OED had to scrap and rebuild it. Unly the AEG engines, the scrapped locomotive's maximum current switch and wheelsets could be reused in the rebuild. The locomotive's remaining electrical equipment came from spare parts taken from \\"half trains\\" (Halbz√ºge). The locomotive was used for shunting in the main workshop and later in K√§fertal depot and was never used in route service. It had the company number of 103 (following the numbers of the steam locomotives), later 05 (following the numbers of the diesel locomotives) and was redesignated as number 06 after the acquisition of diesel locomotive 05. With the introduction of the engineering vehicle numbers, it was given the company number 351. It has now been painted back to the original grey colour and is still operational. = First electric railcar = For the start of electrical operations on the Mannheim‚ÄìWeinheim line in 1914, the OEG procured electric motor coaches in Heidelberg (number 1 to 18) from Waggonfabrik Fuchs plus 27 tram-like two-axle trailer cars (no. 201 to 227). They were used in trains of up to eight passenger cars. Towards the end of the 1950s, the bodies of railcars 4 and 17 were rebuilt in the form of the then current vehicles by Waggonfabrik Rastatt, but leaving the electrical equipment largely unchanged. The conversions were not successful and were therefore discontinued. Operations of the first series of railcars ended with the introduction of articulated vehicles in the 1960s. Individual cars were converted into engineering vehicles. Tw 2 and Tw 16 (which has been converted to an auxiliary car) are still available in a poor condition. = Half trains= 21 \\"half-trains\\" (Halbz√ºge) were delivered as part of the electrification of the Mannheim‚ÄìHeidelberg line in 1928. The half-trains were each composed of a four-axle railcar and a similar four-axle control car, which were firmly connected by a close coupling. There was a passage between the cars for the conductor. They carried the operating numbers 21/22 to 61/62 and had 29 seats per car. For flexible train formation, it was possible to couple two half-trains to a block train and to control both railcars of this train from a driver's cab. The half-trains operated in service until 2 March 1974. Half-train 45/46 was preserved and was rebuilt in 1990 as a saloon car, which can now be rented for special trips; half-train 47/48 is used as a source of spare parts. Set 27/28 was preserved as a half train in the Hannoversches Stra√üenbahn-Museum and serves as an example of the smooth transition from tramway to railway. OEG Wagen 60.jpgOEG half train 59/60 in September 1957 Wehmingen Stra√üenbahnmuseum.JPGOEG carriage 27 in Wehmingen tram museum OEG Halbzug 100 4092.jpgHistoric half-train 45/46 in K√§fertal = Rail freight wagons= Technically largely identical to the half trains, electric freight wagons, numbered 19 and 20, were also acquired in 1928. These were occasionally used for passenger services. A motor coach built in 1915 and damaged in the Second World War was converted into a third motor freight wagon in 1948 and was given the number 18. Freight wagon 19 was rebuilt in the 1960s as a railgrinder and remained in use until 1997; in its last years it was only hauled. Freight wagon 18 is out of service and classified as a historic vehicle. = Fuchs railcar= The last vehicles produced by Fuchs consisted of a total of eight electric railcars, along with fifteen matching trailer cars delivered in 1952 (some trailer cars had been delivered in 1951) and 1957. The motor coaches of the first series delivered bore the company numbers of 63 to 66 and the second series was numbered 67 to 70 (the trailer cars were numbered 140 to 144 and 145 to 154). Because of the tapering vehicle ends, they were called Spitzm√§use (shrews); the vehicles of the first series had a much sharper shape than those of the second series. The railcars were used until the mid-1970s, but not being equipped with magnetic rail brakes, they were then retired. The trailer cars had been stored in 1969 because of their rocky running. Wagons 63, 65 and 68 were sold to the Meiringen‚ÄìInnertkirchen Railway (Meiringen-Innertkirchen-Bahn; MIB) in Switzerland in 1978. There wagons 63 and 65 were equipped with an additional petrol engine and put in operation as Bem 4/4 number 6 and 7. Railcar 68 was used by the MIB for sourcing spare parts and then scrapped. Carriage 66 was taken out of service with the OEG in 1977 and operated as a historical vehicle by volunteers until 2007. The end of rolling stock production by Waggonfabrik Fuchs meant that all of the later vehicles were purchased from other manufacturers. OEG Wagen 69.jpgOEG railcar 69 in September 1957 Mh mib wagen 6.jpegMIB Bem 6, formerly OEG railcar 63 = T4 Rastatt = Engineering vehicle 357, formerly T4 number 76 Waggonfabrik Rastatt delivered a total of seven four-axle large-capacity motor cars of class T4 in 1958 (number 71 to 73), 1960 (number 74) and 1963 (number 75 to 77). It delivered 46 trailer cars (number 165 to 210) matching the motor cars. Some vehicles of this type were equipped in the first half of the 1970s with magnetic rail brakes and low voltage systems, brake lights, turn signals and validators, and later also inductive point control and the Punktf√∂rmige Zugbeeinflussung (Indusi) train control system was installed. They were used in passenger transport until 1989, most recently only in the morning school traffic. Some of the motor cars were rebuilt as engineering vehicles and are still used today, although cars 72 and 74 have been scrapped. Only a few of the trailer cars have been preserved. Motor car 71 and trailer car 193 have been returned to their original finish since 2007, as well as motor car 77 since 2010. = Gt8 Rastatt = Car 81 with old livery on a special trip Waggonfabrik Rastatt delivered two eight-axle articulated trams in 1960 (no. 80) and 1963 (no. 81). Car 80 originally ran as no. 75, with the subsequent delivery of large-capacity car no. 75, it was renumbered 85 and a short time later 80. The car remained unique and were subjected to multiple modifications over time (gearboxes, doors, pantographs, validators, Indusi, signalling control). They were mainly used between 1983 and 1997 for school traffic between Edingen and Mannheim Kurpfalzbr√ºcke, where the two articulated trams used were usually coupled. The rear car ran without power. In the summer of 1991, the cars were operated on trial on the OEG circuit on Sundays and public holidays with the adapted trailer cars 193 and 205 on a scheduled circulation called the OEG-Fahrradexpress (cycle express). Car 80 was stored in 1998 and has now been scrapped. Car 81 served as a reserve vehicle until 2007. It underwent a major inspection in the spring of 2010 and its interior was remodeled with a counter, curtains and small tables. It has been back in operation as a party car since March 2010 covered in dark green plastic. Following a public competition, the car was given the name of Sixty (a nostalgic reference to the 1960s) in the spring of 2011. = Gt8 DUEWAG = DUEWAG, delivered eight eight-axle articulated railcars (no. 82 to 89) from 1966. These were operated from November 1966 and in coupled sets from 28 May 1967. The D√ºwag vehicles differed significantly from the existing Rastatt articulated railcars. The railcars were much larger with a width of 2.50 m and had an electronic control panel control of the Simatic type, which could also be used to drive the train. The haulage of trailer cars was therefore no longer possible, so an air brake system was not needed. Electric door operation and regenerative braking were used. More deliveries followed with small structural changes: the eight railcars built in 1969 (numbers 90 to 97) were largely similar to the cars from 1966. The 13 railcars (98 to 110) supplied in 1973/1974 were no longer equipped with partitions, luggage nets and blinds on the windows and were not designed for 750 volt contact wire tension only as built. Electro-hydraulic spring-loaded brakes served for the first time as holding brakes; these were also retrofitted to the previous series. The cab was scaled down to allow a second door leaf in the right front entry. The fourth and final series, six railcars with the numbers 111‚Äì116, were delivered in 1988/1989. The cars were designed for the retrofitting of air conditioning, this was installed from 1994. They also did not have double leaf doors on the front right. The cars were delivered in white livery and painted before commissioning as the first OEG rail vehicles to have the then new, red and white colour scheme. They are easy to distinguish from the previous series of cars by their tinted windows, extended door windows and their pantographs, which were mounted in the centre of the vehicle. The Duewag Gt8 sets of the different builds could be coupled with each other by means of Scharfenberg couplers to form train assemblies. Until the 1990s, however, the second vehicle was usually occupied by a train driver. The vehicles of the fourth build were first used in sets without a second driver on 4 November 1996; this is now normal practice. Two to three eight-axle articulated railcars of the OEG (usually number 82, 85 and 87) were leased to the Heidelberg traway from October 2007 to May 2009. They were temporarily operated on line 21. The Gt8 dominated the appearance of the OEG for decades and have been continually modernised over the years (one-man operation, spring brakes, driver's desks, passenger seats, microprocessor-monitored control panel controls, exterior and interior lighting, outdoor LCD destination displays, indoor stop displays, colour scheme, automatic vehicle location system). Since the turn of the millennium, individual vehicles have been scrapped after the accessibility-regulation deadline (83‚Äì88, 90‚Äì93, 96, 97) or after accidents (89, 94, 95, 102, 105, 112). After commissioning of the last RNV6 series, all remaining cars of the third series, with the exception of car 110, were decommissioned in the summer of 2013. At the beginning of February 2015, cars 98 and 100 were restored to service, the others (99, 101, 103, 104, 106‚Äì109) were scrapped in the spring of 2019 after a long period of inactivity. At the beginning of 2019, cars 82, 98, 100, 110, 111 and 113‚Äì116 are still operational. The use is limited now to morning student traffic (mostly in double sets) and to meet unscheduled needs. = Gt6 from Bielefeld = Due to increased passenger traffic and the resulting lack of rolling stock, the OEG acquired four used six-axle Duewag articulated rail cars (301 to 304) with matching four-axle trailer cars (311 to 314) in 1982 from Bielefeld (built in 1962). Since these were one-directional vehicles, they could not be used on the circuit, but only operated on the Mannheim Hbf‚ÄìK√§fertal‚ÄìHeddesheim line, since there were turning loops only at the end points. Using the Bielefeld sets between Mannheim and Heddesheim, released Gt8 sets for use on the circuit. The vehicles were retired in 1991/1993 and sold to the Arad Tramway in Romania in 1998. = Variobahn V6 = Car 117, a Variobahn set of the first series After calls for accessibility in public transport became stronger in the 1990s, another replica of the Duewag Gt8 would have been unacceptable. The OEG decided to procure five-part Variobahn sets from the manufacturer ABB Henschel. A prototype in 100% low-floor construction was delivered in 1993 to the Chemnitz Tramway. In contrast to this, the OEG decided to use powered bogies with conventional axles, so only about 70% of the car floor is low-floor, the vehicle width was left at 2.50 metres, the maximum possible on the OEG network, with the outer shape adopted from the Chemnitz prototype. Six five-piece vehicles were delivered by ABB's successor Adtranz from 1996 with the operating numbers of 117 to 122. Initially, they were used only in student traffic between Mannheim- Kurpfalzbr√ºcke and Edingen, but from January 1997 they were used on the complete OEG circuit. The six OEG Variobahn now represent the smallest class of vehicle in the RNV. = Rhein-Neckar-Variobahn RNV6 = Railcar no. 125 of class RNV6 Railcar no. 137 As the first joint vehicle procurement of the four transport companies in the Rhine-Neckar triangle‚ÄîOEG, VBL, MVV and HSB‚Äîthe successor class, the Rhine-Neckar Variobahn was developed in four variants (one-directional or two-directional vehicle, five-part or seven-part). In 2003, the OEG procured ten bidirectional five-part vehicles from the manufacturer Bombardier, which were numbered 123 to 132. Due to its smaller width of 2.40 metres compared to its predecessors and the possibility of negotiating curves with a radius of 15 metres, these cars can be used freely on all sections of the metre-gauge network in the Rhine-Neckar Triangle. The ten RNV6 cars of the initial order were the last cars that were still delivered in the red/white OEG livery. Another ten Variobahn cars (133 to 142) followed from July 2006, which are essentially technically identical to the cars of the first delivery. The RNV was commissioned to carry out the operation of transport services of the former transport companies from 2005. Therefore, these cars were painted in the orange-blue RNV design in the factory. Three identical vehicles (761 to 763) were procured from MVV Verkehr; they are also used on the OEG routes as part of the common vehicle pool. The second batch was followed by a further eight cars from January 2010, which differ from their predecessors in being equipped with Mitrac Energy Saver supercapacitors. They were not procured for the first time by the ‚Äúold companies‚Äù, but directly by the RNV and have carried the four-digit numbers of 4143 to 4150 since their delivery. Car 4149 suffered flood damage in the factory and was therefore not delivered to the RNV for a long time. After the inductive power transmission system was trialed by the manufacturer Bombardier in Augsburg, the car was used by the RNV as a test and training vehicle and equipped accordingly. The car, which is not used in regular service, is numbered 4349. In April 2011, the RNV announced a new order for eleven more vehicles of this class. A twelfth car was also built as a replacement for the undelivered car 4149. The first car of the fourth series was delivered as no. 4151 on 4 January 2013, and the last of the twelve cars was delivered as no. 4162 in July 2013. Thus the procurement of vehicle types by the old companies ended, with future vehicle to be carried out by the RNV. = Operating numbers of the OEG vehicles within the RNV = With the founding of the RNV, it was faced with the problem that there were up to three vehicles designated with the same company number. So as not to have to fundamentally change all documents and vehicle files, the former operating numbers were simply preceded by a fourth digit. This number usually represents the old company. Initially, the new numbering system was used internally for the automatic vehicle location system and then it was installed on the outside of almost all vehicles during 2009 and 2010. The rail vehicles of the OEG were given the initial designation of 4. So former car 98 is now called 4098 and car 123 is now 4123. The buses of the OEG were given the initial designation of 9. However, due to the suspension of OEG bus operations in December 2009, the extended numbers were never attached to the outsides of the buses.  Ticket machines The first series of 15 ticket vending machines was purchased at the end of the 1960s. The first trains were operated on a one-man basis without a guard in 1969. As part of the transition, the OEG ordered another 54 machines, which were installed in 1973 and 1974. The OEG was one of the first non- federal railways in Germany that had vending machines at its stations as a prerequisite for one-man operations. In 1975, most of the stations were equipped with ticket machines, meaning that one-man operations of all trains was supported. Tickets have been issued only at vending machines or in advance since 1 July 2005. This allows the reduction of station stop times and thus increases the punctuality of trains. In the beginning, however, machines were not available at all stations.  Electrification Electrification increased the maximum line speed from 25 km/h to 40 km/h. The new train sets were supplied with compressed air brakes, but the existing traction units and vehicle fleet were also converted from K√∂rting vacuum brakes to Knorr air brakes between 1928 and 1931, largely overnight and during public holidays. At the same time the existing Willer couplers in railcars and funnel couplers with dome irons (Trichterkupplung mit Kuppeleisen) in locomotives and railcars were also converted to Scharfenberg couplers. As a power system, the OEG used direct current, initially at 1200 volts. However, the equipment of the vehicles was also designed for the voltage of 600 volts used by the trams in Mannheim and Heidelberg, and for historical reasons the polarity was reversed on the Heidelberg tram network. From 1974, the power supply of the OEG routes gradually changed to 750 volts. This eliminates the voltage switching at the transition to the tram networks of Mannheim and Heidelberg. Between 1980 and 1990, with the conversion of the routes in the city networks of Mannheim and Heidelberg from 600 to 750 volts, the running voltage was standardised for the first time. The reversal of polarity at the entrance and exit to the Heidelberg network was carried out automatically over approximately 70 metre- long, neutral sections, which were run over using momentum. The power supply of the Heidelberg tram network was completely reversed between 16 and 17 January 2015, so that the power supply on all lined of the RNV is now uniform (direct current 750 volts, negative on the contact wire). The neutral sections under the Czerny bridge and in Handschuhsheim Nord were eliminated as a result.

The piece dates to c. 1925 and in performance lasts approximately eight minutes. Background In his youth, Hindemith supplemented the family income by performing at dances, inns, and in cinema, operetta, and spa orchestras. Later, his sense of humour occasioned numerous parody pieces, dramatic, instrumental, and vocal. These include a Gouda-Emmental March (Gouda-Emmental Marsch; 1920; lost); The atonal cabaret (Das atonale cabaret; 1921; lost); Song in the style of Richard Strauss (Lied 'im Stile Richard Strauss'; c. 1925), with text from the journal \\"Bees and how to keep them\\"; and The Expiring Frog (Recitative e aria ranatica; 1944), inspired by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and Charles Dickens. In 1920 he wrote to Schott, his publisher, \\"Can you make use of foxtrot, Boston, rags and other kitsch? When I can think of no decent music, I write such things.\\"K√∂nnen Sie auch Foxtrotts, Bostons, Rags und anderen Kitsch gebrauchen? Wenn mir keine anst√§ndige Musik mehr einf√§llt, schreibe ich immer solche Sachen. His failure to arrange publication explains the loss of many of these works. Music As might be expected from the title, the composition sees Wagner's overture mangled. Yet all the errors, the playing out of tune, rhythmic imprecision, and interpretative deficiencies to which such an ensemble upon such an occasion might be prone are \\"written out meticulously\\", demanding great technical proficiency in execution, even if the end result is \\"pitiful\\". From bar 261 the piece dissolves into a waltz (part of Les Patineurs by Waldteufel), before returning to Wagner and closing with a shimmering finale. It is not clear whether Hindemith is satirizing Wagner, incompetent performers, \\"ostentatiously dissonant composers\\", or the introduction of popular elements into serious music. Regardless, according to the American music scholar Daniel Albright, of all the reworkings of The Flying Dutchman in twentieth-century music, this is \\"the most explicitly amusing\\". Recordings Recordings include those by the Buchberger Quartett (WER 6197-2); Kocian Quartet (PR 250 093 94); Leipziger Streichquartett (MDG 307 1362-2); and the Solistes de l'Op√©ra National de Paris (UT3-005).

The league's only year of operation was . Ten teams competed in the league which stretched from Jacksonville, Florida to Memphis, Tennessee with several other southern teams mentioned as possible members in newspaper articles from the period. The leagues appears to have collapsed in early July. History The first mention of the league was in March of 1886 when the following ad ran in several major Southern newspapers: ‚ÄúA call has been issued for the captains of all colored base ball clubs of Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee that have a fair record and desire to enter the Southern League of Colored Base Ballists to send name and address to The Manager of the Southern League of Coloered Base Ballists, Lock Box 298, Jacksonville, Florida.‚Äù T.T. Harden was the manager of the league, which had a board of twelve directors. An informational circular obtained by The News and Courier said that the board of directors represented ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a capital of nearly $100,000.‚Äù Clubs that wanted to join the league were required to submit a five dollar fee to cover the cost of advertising, postage, and telegraph cost. They were also required to pay $1.50 for a subscription to The Southern Leader, a black newspaper based in Jacksonville, Florida.Beatty, B. (1980). John Willis Menard: A Progressive Black in Post-Civil War Florida. The Florida Historical Quarterly, 59(2), 123-143. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30146099 The Southern Leader was to be ‚Äúthe official organ of the league‚Äù. The league convention was held on May 22 attended by twenty-two delegates in Jacksonville. During the meeting T. T. Hardin read a prepared report about the league and made recommendations that were adopted by the delegates. It was also decided at the convention that a series of exhibition games would be held May 24 in St. Augustine, Florida. The games would feature the Daisy Cutters, Clippers, Macedonians, Tallapoosas, and Greenleafs. The delegates left the meeting announcing the league's opening day would be June 7 in Atlanta, Georgia and would feature the Georgia Champions and the Memphis Eclipse. The schedules were left to the team directors and managers to workout by June 1. Although no comprehensive schedule is currently known to exist some local newspapers did publish their teams schedules in early June. The Charleston News and Courier published the Fulton‚Äôs schedule on June 6 and the Times- Picayune published the New Orleans Unions on June 7. The first game of the Southern League of Colored Base Ballists was played on June 7, 1886 between the Champions and the Eclipse in Atlanta, Georgia. The Champions won the game 11 to 10. Pointer pitched and Wood caught for Memphis. One of the best documented games of the season was in New Orleans on June 16, 1886. The Unions of New Orleans played the Memphis Eclipse. Memphis won the game 3 to 1. The New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper reported that after watching the game, ‚Äú‚Ä¶colored clubs will furnish good sport, and the teams can play ball‚Ä¶ The Eclipse boys all field well and threw the ball like the best professionals.‚Äù Approximately 500 people attended the game. The winning pitcher for Memphis was William Renfroe.

Early life  Amor began life amidst the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in Tehran, Iran. The son of an air force Colonel and a high school science teacher, he spent his early years unable to enroll into school and escaping to shelters amidst regular bomb raids. In 1992, Amor, his mother and sister arrived in London separated from his father and brothers. Moving from spare room, to lodge, and at times, to the street. Unable to communicate in English, Amor and his sister were rejected by many schools. However, once placed, the lack of school experience that Amor had, spelt a difficult time fitting in, and staying in. He was often dismissed, preferring to wander and discover the deep corners of London for hours on his own. Amidst this ample spare time he discovered a cassette player with an accidental function ‚Äì the ability to overdub. Experiments in beatboxing over tracks began. Soon, his family was partially reunited and Amor's father and one brother rejoined the family. They were finally able to find their first home together. First in Ladbroke Grove, and then in Somers Town, with Amor beginning his educational trials at Gladstone Park, St Peters, and Edith Neville. With the family mostly together again, a roof over their heads, and a sense of stability emerging ‚Äì Amir finally began to feel a sense of settling in. Learning to call Camden his stomping ground, and staying enrolled at his graduating school, Haverstock. Here, his growing community began to introduce him to a new culture ‚Äì of hip hop, graffiti, pirate radio stations, and their potential. Amor learnt how to graffiti, latched onto pirate radio setups, honed in on record stores and quickly amassed a worthy cassette collection of hip hop, funk, soul, alternative rock and electronic music. Then at 14, a chance encounter with a music production software demo without a save function resulted in his first ever (accidentally) recorded production, \\"Jaws\\", a garage track that soon spread around his school and ended up selling a cassette. Career =Career beginnings= Soon after, driven by the potential, and his habit of discovery, Amor found himself inching into recording studios around Camden. Befriending staff and trying to satiate his widening curiosity. It was then when he found Tribal Tree, a studio and youth club teaching music skills to disadvantaged kids. Their quota was full, but stubbornly hanging around landed him a space and the laying down of a foundation of skills. At this course, he learnt how to program beats ‚Äì and heard of the idea that you could actually make a living from creating music. In these classes, recent graduate Plan B taught him his first chords, and program founder Kevin Osbourne lent him keys to his studio after hours. He soon ended up as a tutor at the youth club himself. During the late nights in Osbourne's studio, Amor wrote and produced a demo EP, and on the suggestion of Osbourne, sent it into a songwriting competition run by The Prince's Trust. Amir won the competition and used the ¬£2500 to buy his first computer, and although he didn't yet know how to play them, a guitar and bass. With these, he would listen to Parliament-Funkadelic and Jimi Hendrix day in and day out, playing the bass lines and teaching himself the guitar. Amor partners up with Plan B to produce his first album, Paint It Blacker: The Bootleg Album. A series of tracks of hip hop beats covering the likes of The Rolling Stones, Leonard Cohen and Radiohead. Amor's sensibility of merging live sounds with the electronic begins to solidify ‚Äì and with this, Plan B gets signed to 679 Records, and Amor begins to get hired as a beat maker ‚Äì programming for other producers across Europe. He also begins touring as a session musician with a post-hardcore rock band, and in another as a bass player with live electronics. Plan B hires him again to score his first short film, Michelle. It is during this time that Amor reunites with his brother who stayed in Iran, Shahrokh Izadkhah, and finds an incredible alignment of interests. Shahrokh also happened to be a musician and guitarist, and co- founded the influential Persian rock band O-Hum. They kindle a relationship that begins the workings of their company, Future Instruments. Then in 2009, during a session with Little Boots, Amor convinces Nick Worthington, former A&R; of XL Recordings and founder of 679, to come down. A conversation that ends up in a partnership to open a studio, Major Toms. A space to curate and experiment with new work and artists ‚Äì alongside working with the existing 679 roster. At Major Toms, Amor produces three albums in their first year, on top of his production and engineering one offs. His artists get signed to Atlantic and Amor produces the likes of Sam Smith, Charli XCX, Max√Ømo Park, Peace, Yuck, Marina and the Diamonds, Wretch 32 and Angel Haze. He also meets MNEK, then a young aspiring producer and songwriter, to collaborate on songwriting ‚Äì who moves into Major Toms. = 2011‚Äìpresent: Rudimental = But a turn arrives in 2011 when Atlantic threaten to cut both of Amor's developed and signed artists and under a major funding cut, Amor rapidly turns Major Toms into a commercial studio space. He also speaks with Worthington on expanding it into a record label. On Worthington's advice, they seek out a small existing label. Looking to produce and develop an existing roster instead of starting from the ground up. Worthington hunts out a left field dance record label called Black Butter Records, run by Henry Village ‚Äì whose roster includes Gorgon City, Kidnap Kid and a group called Rudimental. The Black Butter alignment begins. At this time, Worthington also becomes Amor's manager, and a stream of tracks start coming through from Black Butter. A demo called \\"Feel the Love\\", featuring keys and a vocal, is amongst them and sits on Amor's backlog for four months until he reaches it and works on developing and producing the track. The funding cut continues to inch on, and Amor looks to securing a publishing deal in a hopeful attempt to further bolster Major Toms. He reaches out and takes his production of \\"Feel the Love\\" to RAM and Ministry of Sound, who turn it down, and then to Asylum Records, who turn up at Major Toms the next day with a contract to sign it as one off single. Still never having met Rudimental or Henry Village face to face, Amor proposes a joint venture release and a naming confusion ensues ‚Äì \\"Rudimental featuring Amor Amor\\" or \\"Rudimental and Amor Amor\\" are considered. Both are considered too lengthy, and Amor agrees to keeping his name solely in the production and writing credits. After this process, Rudimental come up to Major Toms and finally meet Amor for the first time. Coming together to session, Amor produces and writes more songs for them, resulting in the tracks \\"Not Giving In\\" and \\"Spoons\\". The final touches are also added to Amor's production of \\"Feel the Love\\". On 14 May 2012, \\"Feel the Love\\" is released and debuts at number one on the UK Singles Chart, giving Asylum its first number one single in its 41-year history. To this, Asylum come to Rudimental and Amor with an album deal, but under the requirement that Amor dedicate his production efforts to all of Rudimental's work. The band then invite him to join and heavy touring together ensues. For Rudimental's live show, Amor jumps between bass, guitar and keyboards with an 11-piece live band. A conveyor belt of guest vocalists, a brass section and live drums play Rudimental's now iconic fusion of electronic and live instruments. Amor has also roped Beanie, Bridgette Amofah and MNEK into the show along the way. Debuting their first live show, at BBC Hackney Weekend, Rudimental instantly became the most shared act, ahead of the likes of Kanye West. BBC has proclaimed them the \\"Festival Band of the Summer\\" and their eclectic and energetic live show has headlined festivals across six continents. In 2013, they also toured with Prodigy and The Stone Roses. Also in 2013, Amor graduated with a bachelor's degree in Commercial Music from the University of Westminster. Rudimental's second studio album We the Generation was released in October 2015, and album three is underway ‚Äì with collaborators that include Bobby Womack, George Clinton, DJ Premier, Nas, Nile Rodgers and Max Romeo. Today, Amor continues his production work as Amir Amor; heads up Major Toms; and furthers the development of \\"Future Instruments\\", a company focused on developing tools for intuitive creation.  Awards  Amor's work with Rudimental has been nominated for a Mercury Prize in 2013, and has won several awards including the 2014 Brit Award for Best Single of the Year for \\"Waiting All Night\\" and the Mobo Award for Best Album. It has also received multiple nominations at the MTV Europe Music Awards and has achieved multiple platinum awards for record sales in multiple countriessee Rudimental discography including in the United Kingdom and Australia.

He finished his collegiate career in 2011‚Äì12 as the Great West Conference Player of the Year. He became the first player from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) to win the player of the year award and only the third overall winner in Great West history.  College career  Wilkerson did not enroll at NJIT immediately to play for the Highlanders. It was not until the second semester that he became a student, so his first career game on December 20, 2008 came without the benefit of having a single practice yet with the team. In 22 games that season he averaged 12.5 points and 3.5 rebounds. The following year, he scored in double figures 22 times while averaging 13.0 points and 4.9 rebounds per game. Wilkerson was named an honorable mention for the All-Great West Conference team. In his junior season in 2010‚Äì11 he once again creased his averages to 13.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, leading NJIT in both statistical categories, and was named All-Great West First Team. The Highlanders finished in second place with a 9‚Äì3 conference record. The following year‚ÄîWilkerson's last‚Äîsaw him average career- highs of 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. The Highlanders made it to the championship game of the Great West Conference Tournament but lost to North Dakota, 75 to 60. He was then named the conference player of the year. Wilkerson was also the only men's basketball player from any of the eight New Jersey NCAA Division I schools to be named to an All-American team, which the Associated Press did when he was put on the honorable mention squad. For his career, Wilkerson scored 1,577 points and grabbed 616 rebounds; the rebounding total is the NJIT program record for their Division I era. His point total had been NJIT's all-time scoring mark in the Division I era at the time of his graduation, but the following season, former teammate Chris Flores surpassed him as the school's all-time leading scorer. Professional career Wilkerson went undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft. On November 2, 2012, Wilkerson was selected by the Tulsa 66ers in the eighth round of the 2012 NBA D-League draft.

The count had recently acquired the rulership over this region and needed a central location from which to rule. The island and the key bridge was a natural location for a town. The castle may have been built around the time of the founding of the city. The city was besieged in 1339, 1382 and 1386 but not taken. In 1358 the Graf (or Count) Peter von Aarberg was in financial difficulties and began looking for someone to buy the city. After years of unsuccessful attempts, in 1377-79 he was able to sell the city and his rights as ruler to Bern. The Bernese bailiff took up residence in Aarberg Castle in 1379. In 1380, the old castle roof was replaced with a new shingle roof. In 1419 and again in 1477, the town and castle of Aarberg were nearly destroyed in a fire.

History The church was built in 1845, replacing an earlier church, and re-using some of its fabric. The interior was reordered in 1893 by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. Some of the fittings currently present in the church result from this reordering. Architecture St John's is constructed in slate and igneous rock, with some galleting. It is roofed with green slate. The plan is simple, consisting of a six-bay nave and chancel in one range, a small west tower, and a north porch. The windows along the sides of the church have two lights, and the east window has three lights. The tower has twin bell openings, and a battlemented parapet. Inside the church is an open timber roof. The altar was designed by George Gilbert Scott, and was moved here from Crosthwaite Parish Church in 1848. Panelling in the church, formerly from box pews in Crosthwaite Church, was moved here in 1893. The pulpit, its sounding board, and the sanctuary rails date from the 18th century, and also came from another church.

At least 116 people were killed and 299 wounded in the attacks, making them the deadliest attacks in the country since May 2010. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the attacks.  Background  The attacks occurred about seven months following the withdrawal of the United States military forces from the area, leaving the security of the country in the hands of the Iraqi security forces.  Attacks  Numerous attacks were conducted within hours of each other on 23 July 2012 across thirteen different cities in Iraq. Naharnet reported the number of towns and cities attacked as eighteen. The number of attacks, on the other hand, was given to be thirty. Two more attacks occurred late on 23 July 2012, increasing the number of attacks to thirty-two. Rod Nordland stated that the number of attacks was forty. The major targets of the attacks were security forces, government buildings and Shia Muslim neighbourhoods. The first attack took place on an army base in Saladin Governorate around dawn. In Taji, nearly north of Baghdad, a series of bombs around a number of homes went off simultaneously; as police arrived and residents began searching the wreckage for survivors, a suicide bomber detonated himself, killing more. At least 41 people were killed in this attack, considered the worst of the overall event. A car bomb exploded near a government building in Sadr City in Baghdad, killing 16. At least five car bombs went off in Kirkuk. The insurgents attacked a base in Dhuluiya, killing 15 soldiers. In al-Husseiniya, a predominantly Shiite suburb in northeastern Baghdad and in Mosul, a total of six people were killed in bombing attacks. Explosion in Yarmouk, another neighborhood of Baghdad, killed at least four people and injured another 24. Nearly five people were also killed and 22 or 25 injured when a car bomb exploded near a busy market in Diwaniya. Of all the sites attacked, only Diwaniya is an undisputed Shiite territory. There were checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in the ethnically mixed Diyala Governorate, resulting in 11 dead and 40 wounded. In the western city of Heet, a car bombing occurred near an army patrol, killing one soldier and injuring 10 others. The other towns and cities suffered from bombings were Saadiya, Khan Beni-Saad, Tuz Khurmatu, Dibis, Samarra and Dujail. In addition to all these attacks took place daytime, there were two more attacks late in the day. One of these attacks was a car bomb blast near a caf√© in the Shi'ite Ameen district in southeastern Baghdad, killing six men and wounding 24. The second was a roadside bombing near Baquba, a city northeast of Baghdad. The second blast killed three people and injured seven others.  Perpetrators  Though no group claimed responsibility immediately after the killings, the attacks were believed by Iraqi officials, media and specialists to be orchestrated by Al Qaeda, seeking to gain control of the country following the departure of the American forces. An announcement purported to be from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had been broadcast on 21 July 2012; in the announcement, al-Baghdadi declared the intention towards a new offensive to retake the country, a move claimed to be supported by the Sunni population of Iraq. Previous attacks that have targeted the security forces have been attributed to al-Qaeda. On 25 July 2012, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a statement on radical Islamist websites, indicating that it was responsible for the recent attacks, calling the attacks \\"Destroying the Walls\\" campaign. ISI also stated that it was just the start of a \\"new stage of jihad\\".

The intention being to \\"put the Act to the test\\" and prove its inadequacy to provide for the core demands of the tenants ‚Äì the 'three Fs' of fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale ‚Äì as well as providing sufficient funds for occupier purchase.Aldous, Rishard & Puirseil, Niamh: WE DECLARE, Landmark Documents in Ireland‚Äôs History, ‚ÄòNo Rent Manifesto‚Äô The Land League calls for a rent strike against landlords, 18 October 1881, pp.90‚Äì91; Quercus, London (2008), Land War origins Following the Irish Famine Irish politics lacked direction. Only with the formation of the Home Rule Party in 1870 under its founder Isaac Butt did a Nationalist movement begin to form, albeit with a vague policy of self- government for Ireland. While it won support from the majority of nationalists it lacked the dynamism needed to gain widespread support. Most Irish people, particularly tenant farmers, were more concerned with everyday needs. In the second half of the 1870s crop failures caused serious hardships. Wages fell and evictions were on the increase. Tenants began to demand rent abatements. This marked the beginning of the Land War in 1879 which lasted until 1882. Land League emergence The short comings of the Home Rule Party brought a young ascendancy landlord, and MP for Meath, Charles Stewart Parnell into the foreground, who was all too aware of its shortcomings. In contrast to Butt, he was of a more militant nature. In the House of Commons he was considered a radical 'obstructionalist'. Following discussions with the Fenians John Devoy and Michael Davitt in June 1879, he launched the New Departure to fuse land agitation with the Home Rule movement.Aldous & Puirseil: p.90 This was followed in October 1879 by the foundation of the Irish Nationalist Land League at a meeting in County Mayo where Parnell was elected president of the League. Andrew Kettle, Michael Davitt, and Thomas Brennan were appointed as honorary secretaries. The Land League united the different strands of land agitation and tenant rights movements under a single organisation. The government had introduced the first ineffective Land Act in 1870, followed by the equally lacking Acts of 1880 and 1881. Parnell, although close to advanced nationalists and land reform, carefully retained his constitutional credentials in London.Aldous & Puirseil: p.90 Land League banned But now in 1881 Parnell decided to move towards direct confrontation with the government. The prime minister William Ewart Gladstone had made a considerable advance with his second Land Act to meet Irish demands. But the crucial faults of the Act were that it left the definition of a fair rent to the discretion of the Land Court judges, and that those in rent-arrears were denied recourse to the fair-rent clause.O'Brien, Joseph V.: William O'Brien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, The No-rent Manifesto pp.18‚Äì22, University of California Press (1976) For Davitt, no rent was the only fair rent. The support newspaper of the Land League, The United Ireland edited by William O'Brien was quick to expose the short comings of the act. Parnell and O'Brien were convinced of the need to stem the flock of tenants, urged by the clergy, seeking rent abatement in the courts, as they were certain that the act would leave most of the rents unchanged.O'Brien, J.V.: p.19 Together with all of his party lieutenants Parnell went into a bitter verbal offensive against the act, urging tenants to withhold rents. Gladstone's cabinet decided \\"to transmute Parnell, by imprisonment, into a symbol of the Irish nation\\" where he was interned under the Irish Coercion Act in Kilmainham Jail on 12 October for \\"sabotaging the Land Act\\". Two days later the Land League was banned. Several other members of the party joined their leader in Kilmainham jail. O'Brien followed three days later, having been guilty with his publication of \\"treasonable practices\\".O'Brien, J.V.: p.20 No Rent Manifesto At this point Parnell decided it was the time to launch a \\"no-rent\\" campaign in Ireland. He chose the new jail arrival to draft such a plan with the words \\"O'Brien, of all the men in the world, you are the man we wanted\\" tasking him to draft a \\"No Rent Manifesto\\". It appeared on the front page of the United Ireland on 22 October,O'Brien, J.V.: p.20 and published abroad in the New York Times.New York Times, 1881 It bore the signatures of the League executive board, Dillon only signing reluctantly. Davitt's name was added because he was in jail in England, which he disapproved of, saying the action was eight months too late.O'Brien, J.V.: p.20 O'Brien's text read as follows: > ::::::::::::::::NO RENT MANIFESTO ‚ÄòFELLOW-CITIZENS: The hour to try your > souls and to redeem your pledges has arrived.

Parnell in return agreed to withdraw the manifesto and bring violence to an end. The arrangement was unpopular with radicals as it resulted in a decisive shift away from radical land reform to a mainly constitutional movement for Home Rule.Aldous & Puirseil: p.91 References External links *O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: William O‚ÄôBrien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, The No-rent Manifesto pp. 18‚Äì22, University of California Press (1976) .

He became well known when he and his elder brother Justus published the poetry and short story collection De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar in 1822.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, Tsjalling,Wiersma, p. 9. until all the Halbertsma Brothers' prose and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, pp. 603‚Äì606. This book played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.Jensma, p. 197. Of the three Brothers Halbertsma, Eeltsje was probably the most talented, en especially his poetry is still very much admired.Wiersma, pp. 9‚Äì10. His oeuvre included the poem De Alde Friezen, which later became the national anthem of the Western Frisian people.Frysl√¢n Sjongt, pp. 10‚Äì11.Oppewal and Boorsma, pp. 90‚Äì93. Life =Youth and background= Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma was born on October 8, 1797,Wiersma, p. 7. in his parents' house on Kowemerk (\\"Cow Market\\") street in the village of Grou, in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland. He was the fourth son of the baker and small-time merchantOppewal and Boorsma, p. 16. Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756‚Äì1809)Terpstra, p. 317. and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk) Tsjallings Binnerts (1767‚Äì1809).Wiersma, pp. 7‚Äì8. He had three elder brothers: Justus (\\"Joast\\") (1789‚Äì1869),Breuker 1993, p. 588.Terpstra, p. 316. Tsjalling (1792‚Äì1852),Breuker 1993, p. 591. and Binnert (1795‚Äì1847). Two children who were born later died in early childhood, the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. The brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Eeltsje was only eleven years of age.Wiersma, pp. 8‚Äì9. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the Brothers Halbertsma later in life,Hemminga, p. 56. were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother. This mother, Ruerdtsje Binnerts, was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From the letters of Eeltsje's brother Justus Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.Wiersma, p. 8. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland (\\"Terrible Ice- drift and Flooding in Gelderland\\"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents ran in the family. =Education= Like his elder brother Justus, Eeltsje Halbertsma was sent to the French school in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden for a year by his mother, and after that, he was enrolled in the Latin school, also in Leeuwarden. There, he started following lessons probably just before Ruerdtsje Binnerts' death in December 1809. As their father, Hidde Halbertsma, hat died in January of that same year, the brothers became orphans because of this unfortunate event. Justus, the eldest brother, was studying in Amsterdam at the time. Eeltsje could continue his education in the Latin school because the middle brothers, Tsjalling and Binnert, kept their father's bakery running with the help of their father's baker's mates. As commuting from Grou to Leeuwarden and back again on a daily basis was out of the question with roads and transportation being what they were at that time, Eeltsje boarded in the city with one Hawerdink, an acquaintance of his brother Justus, who apparently introduced him to the most vulgar form of City Frisian, a Dutch (not Frisian) dialect which is spoken in the cities in Friesland. When he had finished his training in the Latin school, towards the end of 1814, Eeltsje Halbertsma left for Holland, where he started a study of medicine at the University of Leiden which lasted until April 1818.Twerda, p. 296. In the student city of Leiden, however, he became caught up in the rough night life, and that was why, by way of reorientation, he left for Heidelberg, in Germany, for half a year in the spring of 1818.Breuker 2016, p. 1124.Twerda, pp. 296‚Äì297. There he enjoyed himself tremendously at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t, and later in his life he always looked back on his Heidelberg period with a sense of wistfulness.Terpstra, p. 318.Wiersma, p. 10. The lessons he followed in Heidelberg for the most part had to do with obstetrics. After the summer, he returned to Leiden, where he ended his study by obtaining his doctorate in medicine on October 13, 1818. Afterwards, Halbertsma became physician in Purmerend, in northern Holland, where he lived for a year and a half, and also became involved with a local girl whom he referred to as \\"the Little Peacock\\" in his letters to his brother Justus. Eventually, though, he became ill, and was brought back to his family in Grou, probably towards the end of 1820. When he had recovered, he did not go back to Holland, but instead started a practice in the village where he was born. He would spend the rest of his life there, because, he wrote to his brother Justus, \\"Grou is alway lovely to me.\\" Because of his good education, but also because of his compassionate bedside manner, Halbertsma had a very spread-out practice, with patients not only in Grou, but also scattered around the countryside and in neighbouring villages. This required him to travel a lot, for which he often had to depend on boats in the marshy lake country of Central Friesland.Terpstra, p. 319. =Nature and views= From stories of people who knew him, Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma emerges as a man who was quickly moved, but could also have a lot of fun.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40. According to the bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff, who was acquainted with him for many years, Halbertsma was big- hearted and generous, and a droll story-teller. One of Halbertsma's biographers described him as \\"a fine-feeling spirit, an idealistic dreamer, an independent and courageous man, afflicted by periods of melancholy and doubt; a boh√©mien and a rascal, such as there has been no second of in all of Western Frisian literature.\\"Wiersma, p. 13. Halbertsma's letters to his brother Justus are lively and open-hearted, and also quite entertaining still. As for his views, Halbertsma had become influenced by Deism in his student days, but according to himself he had changed his opinion after reading the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder. Politics Halbertsma tried to stay away from. In the company of others he was sometimes seduced into speaking on that subject, but he was always afraid to say too much; his father had been a supporter of the Patriot movement, and Halbertsma could never forget how badly that had ended. For all that, he did not just stand by when his sense of justice was violated, as is shown by his poems De Grytman (\\"The Grietman\\"; about corruption in the political upper classes in Friesland) and Batthyany's Dea (\\"Batthyany's Death\\"; about the execution of Lajos Batthy√°ny, the leader of the Hungarians in the Hungarian Rebellion of 1848‚Äì1849). He also wrote, in Dutch, a poem in which he rages against the fact that Frisian members of the Tweede Kamer voted against the proposal to abolish slavery in 1853.Breuker 1993, p. 593. On the other hand, he was not so progressive that he felt himself in any way connected to those he called, in 1855, \\"red democrats\\" (that is to say socialists and other political radicals), whom he separated from \\"the decent-minded\\", with which he meant the progressive, liberal section of the settled middle class, to which he himself belonged. In 1827, Halbertsma became a member of the Provinciaal Friesch Genootschap ter Beoefening van Friesche Geschied-, Oudheid- en Taalkunde (\\"Provincial Frisian Society for the Study of Frisian History, Antiquities and Linguistics\\"), but in 1834, he cancelled his membership because he felt this club was full to the rafters with silly people.Van der Schaaf, p. 38 He could not stomach the affected poshness of the middle class gentlemen, and neither could he reconcile such graveness of bearing with the 'gluttony and wine-guzzling' which followed the gatherings. \\"Es gibt Narren aller Art\\" (\\"It takes fools of all kinds\\"), he wrote to his brother Justus. Justus did remain a member of the society, but because he was a Mennonite minister in Deventer, in the province of Overijssel, and was therefore mostly a member by correspondence, it was somewhat easier for him to look at things with a certain detachment. Later, Eeltsje Halbertsma became a member of the Selskip foar Fryske Taal en Skriftekennisse (\\"Society for Knowledge of Frisian Language and Literature\\"), where he felt much more at home.[source needed] Gable stone with the likeness of Eeltsje Halbertsma in the front wall of the house of his birth in Grou. =Family= In June 1823, Halbertsma married Baukje Fockens (1795‚Äì1877), a woman from a well-to-do family from Bolsward, whom he had met in the autumn of 1822. She was the daughter of Livius (Liuwe) Regnerus Fockens, a mayor of Bolsward who had died not long before. Halbertsma and his wife had four children: two sons and two daughters. Only their son Hidde would survive his father, as the other son, Liuwe, died in 1854, and both of the girls, Ruerdtsje and Anna, were laid to rest yn 1851. The death of Anna (1832‚Äì1851), with whom he was exceptionally close, hit Halbertsma especially hard; about this loss he wrote the touching poem Op Anna's Dea (\\"On Anna's Death\\"), which was published in 1854, in the poetry and short story collection Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen (\\"Grief and Pleasure and Down Upon the Lee Shore\\").Brothers Halbertsma 1958, p. 347.Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 258-259. Halbertsma's marriage was, after the first few years, not very happy, as he was much too fond of alcohol, while his wife nagged constantly, was distrustful and reproached him continuously for living off her money. It is therefore probably not coincidental that in several of Halbertsma's stories the main characters are a drunken man and his angry wife. In 1853, when both marriage partners had neglected their household for years, the parents were placed under guardianship by both of their sons, which was done especially on the initiative of Liuwe. Although Halbertsma managed to become his own master again in 1857, this was a humiliation for which it was not easy for him to forgive his son, and there is no elegy for Liuwe's passing in 1854, as Halbertsma did make for both of his daughters. =Writing career= Halbertsma felt the drive to write for the first time, as his brother Justus would later tell it, when he came back from his half-year in Heidelberg, and noticed that the street songs in the Netherlands were of a very low quality compared to those in Germany. According to Justus, Eeltsje Halbertsma set out writing poetry to replace the existing songs with better ones of his own making. The linguist Philippus H. Breuker, who added an extensive and penetrating afterword to the reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes of 1993, observed, however, that this assertion could \\"never be more than half the truth,\\" as Halbertsma's early poetry was not of a high literary value; quite the opposite, in fact. According to Breuker, it seems more likely that Halbertsma wanted to emulate these Dutch street songs. Later on, he must have come under the influence of Justus' ideas, who wanted to preserve the Western Frisian language by reintroducing it for writing after it had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.Boelens et al., p. 116.Breuker 1993, p. 589.Wiersma, p. 11. From that it followed that Justus had to get the Frisians to read in their own language (otherwise, writing it would not be of much use), and to achieve that aim, he set out writing the sort of folk literature which dovetailed nicely with Eeltsje Halbertsma's work. As Justus remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and short fiction were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning. Although writing short stories and poems was something which Eeltsje Halbertsma could not do without, from approximately 1830 onwards the social prestige he won with it also started to play a role. In 1822, the best of the early works of Eeltsje and Justus were collected under the title De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar (\\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\\"; original, archaic spelling: De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.Breuker 1993, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time. A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, p. 298.Wiersma, pp. 5, 11. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen √∫t in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonst√™d).Brothers Halbertsma 1958, p. 589-594. Eeltsje Halbertsma was almost certainly the most talented of the three writing Halbertsma Brothers. While Tsjalling's works were purely intended for entertainment, and Justus composed his stories and poetry in a somewhat distant, cerebral way, which keeps the reader a little detached from what is read, Eeltsje put his soul and heart into his poems and stories.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 17. It is this emotion which brings his work closer to the reader. Furthermore, Eeltsje's prose and poetry are in proportion to each other, qualitatively, while in Justus' works the poetry is generally quite clearly not of the same high standing as his prose. In the middle of the 20th century the author and literary critic Anne Wadman stated that Eeltsje was the greatest poet of his time in the Netherlands; as neither Willem Bilderdijk nor Isa√§c da Costa were fit to hold a candle to him (he wrote), one would look invain for someone of the same stature in the Dutch literature of that period.Breuker 1993, p. 595. On the basis of Romanticism, which he had acquired in Heidelberg, Eeltsje Halbertsma often needed a first impulse for his works, an existing text or melody that he could, as he himself put it, frisify \\"in such a way that no one could recognise the original anymore.\\" Because of this it is thought that the masterful Jonker Pyt en Sibbel (\\"Squire Pete and Sibylle\\") could possibly be a much improved version of the Dutch-language poem Steedsche Jonker en een Friessche Boerin (\\"City Squire and a Frisian Farmer's Wife\\"), from the 18th century. It is beyond dispute that Halbertsma based some of his poetry on earlier works by such poets as Johann Peter Hebel and Ludwig H√∂lty. For instance, De Boalserter Merke (\\"The Bolsward Fair\\"), still one of his most well-known works, is a Nachdichtung of Hebel's lovesong Hans und Verene, in which the main characters were renamed Hoatse and Wobbel, the background was shifted from a German well to a fair in the Frisian city of Bolsward, and quite a few smaller changes were made. An example of a poem based on H√∂lty's work is the somewhat morbid Deagraverssankje (\\"Grave-digger's Song\\").Terpstra, p. 314. Though Halbertsma often wrote idyllic poems in his early years, such as It Marke (\\"The Little Lake\\") and Geale' Sliepke (\\"Geale's Nap\\"), and, to a lesser degree, It Famke (\\"The Girl\\"), later the circumstances of his family life and professional difficulties so depressed him that he wrote, \\"you [will] find in my last works nothing of that Arcadia.\\" In its place came moving elegies, such as De Likeblommen (\\"The Leek Flowers\\"), Op Anna's Dea (\\"On Anna's Death\\"), and It Tsjerkh√¥f by J√ªntiid (\\"The Churchyard in the Evening\\"), and also poems such as It Libbensein (\\"Life's End\\"), and Deagraverssankje (\\"Grave-digger's Song\\"), which reflect upon the transitory nature of human existence. Halbertsma was, however, also the author of the mildly humorous Ald Jan-om (\\"Old Uncle John\\"), in which a farm-hand of advanced years complains of the farmer's daughter's constant stream of suitors, who are always getting in his way,Brothers Halbertsma 1958, p. 46. and of the love poem Skipperssankje (\\"Skipper's Song\\"), a mariner's entreaty to his beloved not to forget him, even if his ship should sink and he should drown.Frysl√¢n Sjongt, p. 66-67. The appreciation for Halbertsma's strongly rhetorical freedom hymns has eroded in the course of the 20th century, but even so, the nationalistic song De Alde Friezen,Frysl√¢n Sjongt, p. 10-11.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 17, 90‚Äì93. (\\"The Frisians of Old\\") is still the national anthem of the Western Frisian people, which it was proclaimed to be yn 1875 (in a thoroughly revised version by Jacobus van Loon).Schroor, p. 2831. In his prose Halbertsma shows himself to be a smooth story-teller, occasionally using a poetic-realistic approach, such as in the story Utfanh√ªs by de Boer (\\"Staying the Night on the Farm\\"), at other times becoming ironic, such as in De Kl√∫nskonk fan Us Ald Dominy (\\"Our Old Minister's Skate-walking Leg\\"). De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar (\\"The Norg Gelding to Gabe Tailor\\"), which has the form of a letter from the afterlife to Gabe Tailor, written by his dead horse, is a satire, while in De Reis nei de Jichtmasters (\\"The Journey to the Gout Masters\\") Halbertsma uses mild humour and a little mockery to poke fun at his own medical profession. In the longer story De Jonkerboer (\\"The Gentleman Farmer\\"), which some critics call a novella, the main motif is a longing for a peaceful and diligent existence in the country-side. That same feeling is also embodied by De Quickborn (\\"The Quickborn\\"), a choice of poems Halbertsma translated very freely from the poetry collection of the same name which was originally written in the Low German dialect of the northern German region of Dithmarschen by Klaus Groth.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 41. The statue of Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma in Grou. Striking things about Eeltsje Halbertsma's literary works are the wonderful sound patterns in some of his poems, especially Geale' Sliepke (\\"Geale's Nap\\"), and his playful additions of phrases in other languages or dialects, which occur mostly in his stories, but also in some poems, like Jonker Pyt and Sibbel (\\"Squire Pete and Sibylle\\"), where the squire has just returned from fashionable France, and now believes it shows his breeding and social status to throw around French words and phrases.Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 18‚Äì20.Brothers Halbertsma 1993, pp. 11‚Äì12. \\"Gibberish, odd names, strange types of people, stopgap words, [...] the most surprising metaphors, and the most unexpected jumps in a train of thought,\\" all of these occur regularly in Halbertsma's prose. In his works he was guided by the ideal image he had in his mind of the Western Frisians as simple but genuine people, which he contrasted against the Dutch, who were in his eyes refined but insincere. =Death= In his last years there was not much which connected Halbertsma to the village of Grou. Because of his unhappy marriage, he could not find solace at home, and the death of his daughter Anna, in 1851, had made him lose his cheerfulness. The following year his brother Tsjalling also died, who had been the steadfast centre of the family. That is why Eeltsje, after he had transferred his medical practice to his son Hidde in 1856, started a wandering life visiting family members who lived far away. Later on, he lived for little while by himself in Leeuwarden, but a few weeks before his death he arranged to be brought back to Grou. He died there on March 22, 1858, when he was sixty years old. He was buried in a double-deep grave which later came to lie outside of the churchyard boundaries, and is now marked by three red stones in an otherwise yellow-paved pathway. Legacy After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.Breuker 1993, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\"). This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì596. it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. In 1949, the author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which they saw their own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As of today Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics. In 1993, the tenth reprint of the book was published, including for the first time some (earlier, lower-quality) work of Eeltsje Halbertsma which had until then remained outside of Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, p. 610. This reprint had a (for Western Frisian literature) ambitious printing of 3,000 copies, but was sold out within two months. The Selskip foar Fryske Taal en Skriftekennisse hired the sculptor Willem Molkenboer in 1875, to make a stone tablet in which the likeness of Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma was chiselled out. This was placed as a gable stone in the front wall of the house where the Halbertsma Brothers were born, on what later was renamed Halbertsmaplein (\\"Halbertsma Square\\").Koopmans, p. 309.Twerda, p. 299. In 1879, another stone tablet by the same artist was added to the left with the likeness of Justus Hiddes Halbertsma. Furthermore, in 1903 the Selskip ordered a statue of Eeltsje Halbertsma to be made and placed on Parkstrjitte (\\"Park Street\\") in Grou, consisting of a bust on a more than man-high limestone column resting on a pedestal of granite, made by Johan Schr√∂der.De Vries, p. 98.

Function Members of the TCP protein domain family appear to be involved in cell proliferation. It may also have a role in signalling pathways since it has three phosphorylation sites. The TCP domain is necessary for specific binding to promoter elements of the Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene and also in DNA binding. Evolution This family of transcription factors are exclusive to vascular plants. They can be divided into two groups, TCP-C and TCP-P, that appear to have separated following an early gene duplication event. This duplication event may have led to functional divergence and it has been proposed that the TCP-P subfamily are transcriptional repressors, while the TPC-C subfamily are transcription activators. Structure The TCP proteins code for structurally related proteins implicated in the evolution of key morphological traits. However, the biochemical function of CYC and TB1 proteins remains to be demonstrated. One of the conserved regions is predicted to form a non-canonical basic-Helix- Loop-Helix (bHLH) structure. This domain is also found in two rice DNA-binding proteins, PCF1 and PCF2, where it has been shown to be involved in DNA-binding and dimerization.

He made his debut as a writer before working with Joris Ivens in producing two documentary films. In 1934 he was called to the Dutch East Indies by Albert Balink to help with the production of Pareh (1936). Franken stayed in the Indies until before World War II, making newsreels. After the war he returned to the country and continued this work. In 1949 Franken returned to the Netherlands, where he made another film before his death. Biography Franken was born on 2 February 1899 in Deventer, the Netherlands. As a youth he worked as a writer- cum-director before moving to Paris in 1925; in Paris he wrote on the experimental films being produced in France, and in 1928 he directed the stageplay D 16 Mensch en Machine (D 16 Man and Machine), based on the story \\"Donogoo Tonka\\" by Jules Romains. The following year, working with Joris Ivens, Franken directed the shorts Regen (Rain) and Branding. Around this time he made another short, entitled Jardin du Luxembourg (Garden of Luxembourg), and during the early 1930s he directed several other films. Also in the early 1930s he was active in the Netherlands as a member of the Filmliga, a Dutch cinema club (1927‚Äì1933) founded by Menno ter Braak and Henrik Scholte, and as the chairman of the Association for Educational and Development Films; with the Amsterdam Liga he ran the De Uitkijk Theatre. Franken, with Dutch- Indonesian journalist and filmmaker Albert Balink and the ethnic Chinese Wong brothers, started the production company Java Pacific Film in the 1930s in what was then the Dutch East Indies, which produced Pareh (1936), an ethnographic film considered a forerunner for the \\"Indonesia Indah\\" films. Balink had brought Franken to the country to ensure its artistic quality. Franken helped with the cinematography and screenwriting and, for greater commercial viability, was given top billing. However, the film was a commercial flop and bankrupted its producers, including Franken. While making these feature films he also worked with the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF), owned by Balink, and directed newsreels. During this time Franken may have been involved in the production of Terang Boelan, a feature film directed by Balink. The Indonesian historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Franken was not involved as Terang Boelan involved less ethnographic work, while the American film scholar Karl G. Heider writes that Franken co-directed the film. In 1938 Franken directed the semi-documentary film Tanah Sabrang, based on the writings of Adrian Jonkers and promoting emigration from Java to Sumatra. By the time World War II broke out Franken was already in the Netherlands; ANIF had closed in 1940. After the war, Franken returned to the Indies ‚Äì since proclaimed an independent nation named Indonesia ‚Äì to make films for the Netherlands Government Information Service (). Franken returned to the Netherlands in 1949, producing a film for the government. He died on 1 August 1953 in Lochem. Legacy On Franken's death, an obituary in De Telegraaf stated that he was a pioneering documentary filmmaker for the Netherlands and one of the country's few avant-garde creative professionals. The film historian Peter Cowie writes that Franken was underrated and \\"a true pioneer and a very real pillar of the documentary achievement usually credited solely to Joris Ivens\\". Heider considers Pareh and Terang Boelan the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s.

The first member of the family discovered, it was originally identified by accident in the 1950s. A component of mouse leukemia extract capable of causing tumors, particularly in the parotid gland, in newborn mice was reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 and identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy at the National Cancer Institute, after whom it was once called \\"SE polyoma\\". Stewart and Eddy would go on to study related polyomaviruses such as SV40 that infect primates, including humans. These discoveries were widely reported at the time and formed the early stages of understanding of oncoviruses. Pathology MPyV is primarily spread among mice via the intranasal route and is shed in urine. Genetic susceptibility to MPyV infection among mice varies significantly, and not all MPyV strains are oncogenic. In general, only newborns and immunosuppressed mice (usually transgenic) develop tumors upon infection; although originally observed as a cause of parotid gland tumors, the virus may induce solid tumors in a wide variety of tissue types of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin. Although viruses in circulation among feral mice can be tumorigenic, under natural conditions the virus does not cause tumors; maternal antibodies have been shown to be critical in protecting neonates. It has been described as rare in modern laboratory mouse research colonies. MPyV is also capable of infecting and causing tumors in other rodent species, including guinea pigs, hamsters, and rats, though the diversity of tissue types giving rise to tumors is reduced in these species. MPyV does not infect humans and is not associated with human cancers. Structure A alt=A 3D-printed model of a hollow isocahedral capsid in two pieces. Like other members of the polyomavirus family, MPyV has an unenveloped icosahedral (T=7) viral capsid around 45 nanometers in diameter. The capsid contains three proteins; capsid protein VP1 is the primary component and self-assembles into a 360-unit outer capsid layer composed of 72 pentamers. The other two components, VP2 and VP3, have high sequence similarity to each other, with VP3 truncated at the N-terminus relative to VP2. VP2 and VP3 assemble inside the capsid in contact with VP1. alt=A rendered capsid image with the symmetry-related VP1 monomers shown in different colors and centered on a strict pentamer, producing a radial symmetry effect. VP1 is capable of self-assembly into virus-like particles even in the absence of other viral components. This process requires bound calcium ions and the resulting particles are stabilized by, but do not require, intra-pentamer disulfide bonds. Genome MPyV has a closed, circular double-stranded DNA genome of around 5 kilo-base pairs. It contains two transcriptional units located on opposite strands, called the \\"early region\\" and \\"late region\\" for the stage in the viral life cycle in which they are expressed; each region produces a pre-messenger RNA molecule from which six genes are expressed through alternative splicing. The three genes in the early region express the large, middle, and small tumor antigens (LT, MT, ST) and are sufficient for inducing tumors. The three genes in the late region express the three capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. Between the early and late regions is a region of noncoding DNA containing the origin of replication and promoter and enhancer elements. Expression of a microRNA from a region overlapping one of the LT exons has also been identified and is thought to be involved in downregulating expression of the tumor antigens. Replication =Cellular entry= A series of thawed alt=Five aligned micrographs showing different positions of a virion relative to the outer membrane of a cell being infected; in the first micrograph the virion is located on the exterior surface and in the last it has fully penetrated the membrane. Viruses lacking a viral envelope often have complex mechanisms for entry into the host cell. MPyV capsid protein VP1 binds to sialic acids of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b on the cell surface. The functions of VP2 and VP3 are less well understood, but at least VP2 has been reported to be exposed upon endocytosis of the viral particle and may be involved in releasing the virus from the endoplasmic reticulum. MPyV has been reported to enter cells through both a caveolae- dependent endocytosis mechanism and by an independent mechanism through uncoated vesicles. Unlike many viruses that enter the cell through endocytosis, polyomaviruses penetrate the cell membrane and enter the cytosol from the late endoplasmic reticulum rather than from endosomes, although conformational changes in response to low pH in endolysosomes have been hypothesized as critical steps in the process. MPyV membrane exit is believed to depend on the presence of specific host proteins located in the late ER; for example, the host protein ERp29, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, has been shown to disrupt the conformation of VP1. It is not known whether entry into the cytosol is obligatory for MPyV infection or whether the particle could enter the cell nucleus directly from the ER. Even a single viral particle entering the nucleus can be sufficient for infection. =Virion assembly= Micrograph of a thin section of a cell infected with MPyV illustrating the structure of the virus factories in which new virions are produced. Red indicators point to tubular structures (arrow: empty tubule; arrowhead: filled tubule) and blue indicators point to virions (arrow: empty virion; arrowhead: filled virion). The dense center of the filled structures likely indicates the presence of virus genomic DNA. New MPyV virions are assembled in the nucleus in dense local aggregations known as virus factories. Capsid proteins, produced in the cytoplasm of the host cell, enter the nucleus as assembled capsomers consisting of pentameric VP1 associated with VP2 or VP3. Nuclear localization sequences consistent with karyopherin interactions have been identified in capsid protein sequences, facilitating their transit through nuclear pores. Once inside the nucleus they assemble into mature capsids containing a copy of the viral genome, although the exact mechanism of encapsidation is not well understood. Filamentous or tubular structures representing polymerized VP1 have been observed in the nuclei of infected cells as intermediates in the assembly process from which mature virions are produced. Tumorigenesis MPyV contains three proteins extensively studied for their ability to induce neoplastic transformation (that is, carcinogenesis); these proteins are expressed from the early region of the viral genome and are known as large, middle, and small tumor antigen. Murine polyomavirus and its close relative hamster polyomavirus are historically the only two known viruses whose genomes contain middle tumor antigen, by far the most efficient of the three early proteins at inducing carcinogenesis. In 2015 the genome sequence of a rat polyomavirus was reported to contain middle tumor antigen as well, consistent with expectations that it evolved uniquely in the rodent lineage of the polyomavirus family. Expression of MT from a transgene or introduction in cell culture can be sufficient to induce transformation. Studies using MT have played key roles in understanding host-cell oncogenes and their effects on carcinogenesis, particularly in the study of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Transgenic mice expressing MT are widely used as models for cancer progression and metastasis, particularly of breast cancer. Taxonomy In the 2015 taxonomic update to the polyomavirus group, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classified MPyV as the type species of the genus Alphapolyomavirus under its new official name Mus musculus polyomavirus 1.

Lynn also served as President of the Memphis Pros of the American Basketball Association in 1972. Minnesota Vikings In 1974, Lynn was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as an assistant to the owner. He was named general manager in 1975 by then Vikings owner Max Winter following the departure of GM Jim Finks. Lynn was GM when the Vikings went to one Super Bowl and four Division Championship during his first four years with the team. In 1989, thinking that the Vikings were a big-time running back away from being a great team, he dealt what eventually turned into 5 players and 8 draft picks to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for running back Herschel Walker. The three 1st round and three 2nd round picks eventually netted the Cowboys Emmitt Smith, Darren Woodson, and Russell Maryland and three Super Bowl rings. On the Vikings' side, Walker gained 148 yards rushing on 18 carries in his first game, but averaged less than 81 yards a game for the other 26 games.

It was released on August 14, 2012 through Sumerian Records. The album debuted at number 50 on the Billboard 200, number 3 on the Top Hard Rock Albums, number 13 on the Top Independent albums, number 18 on Top Rock albums, and hit number 1 on the CMJ radio loud rock chart. This is the band's only album to feature vocalist Geoffrey Ficco. Recording and Production The record was recorded at Keene's home studio in Los Angeles in 2012. Preproduction versions of almost every song had been previously recorded by Keene throughout 2011, along with an additional song which ultimately was not used for the record. Keene noted that this track was better suited for his solo project and that the song would eventually see the light of day under that project name. Some of the guitar tracking for the preproduction captured a natural, raw quality and ended up being used in the final album versions of the songs. Keene approached the recording of Autotheism differently than previous records. All guitar and bass was recorded direct and drums were tracked live right in Keene's living room. Keene states that 7 different guitars were used to achieve the broad array of tones heard, including his neon green Washburn WM526, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul, a Bernie Rico Jr, as well as a chambered guitar made of carbon fiber. Evan Brewer debuted the use of fretless bass in The Faceless on two tracks on a whim of experimentation in the studio. Keene also explored a more industrial influence, creating \\"post- apocalyptic\\" percussion sequences on many of the tracks. This played a big part in giving the record its distinctly dark quality. Another key quality of Autotheism came from Keene's time spent on experimenting with string arrangements and keyboard sequencing. The lyrics were written largely in the studio. A process that Keene and Ficco described as \\"grueling, but rewarding\\". An outline for the story of the lyrics was written, followed by the individual topics for each song. Then, Keene and Ficco worked out the lyrics and phrasing as they went along with the recording process. \\"The bulk of the time was spent on the writing of the lyrics and phrasing. Once that part was complete, the actual recording flew by. \\"Geoff is an exceptionally easy vocalist to record and produce\\" said Keene. Vocally, the album has a much greater emphasis on Michael Keene's clean vocals than previous albums. This is shown on the album's first track, which is sung primarily by Keene. A guest appearance by Keene's long time friend and infamous YouTube sensation Sergio \\"The Sexy Sax Man\\" Flores appears on the track \\"Deconsecrate\\". Keene's mother also contributes harmonizing background vocals on the track \\"Emancipate\\". Theme Keene has stated in interviews that the name \\"Autotheism\\" derives from \\"auto\\" meaning self and \\"theism\\" meaning belief in God or gods, hence autotheism means \\"believing in one's self\\", or \\"being your own God\\". The album questions antiquated belief systems that are in play in current society. As well as touching upon religion, the album touches upon growth in technology at an exponential rate, the Holographic Universe theory, and science as a new religion, or alternatively, knowledge and reason as a reigning religion. Keene said in interviews that the inspiration for the album came partly from reading a book by Ray Kurzweil called The Singularity Is Near. The album also has an underlying theme of \\"Age of Reason\\" or \\"Renaissance\\"-esque discovery and ethics traits; alternatively, \\"starting over\\" or massively rethinking the way current systems are run. The album artwork, as well as the music and lyrics, intuitively portray this atmosphere. Track listing Music written by Michael Keene, except where noted.

Blackburn was the first pilot to carry newspapers for commercial sale by airYorkshire Evening Post, 24 July 1913. and on 22 July 1914 piloted the first scheduled airline service in Great Britain. Biography =Early life= Born on 19 January 1879Headstone at Trinity Church, Jersey, Channel Islands. in Dymock, Gloucestershire, Blackburn was the third child of Edwin Waller Blackburn and Sarah Jane Blackburn (n√©e Tate). Soon after his birth the family moved to Carcroft, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, where his father took up an appointment as a schoolmaster.1891 census, reference RG12/3866. Harold became an engineer and by 1901 worked as a bicycle maker and repairer in Doncaster.1901 census, reference RG13/4414. =Pre-war career= Blackburn moved to London around 1909. In association with Albert Walker he built the Blackburn-Walker biplane, a tailless three-bay tandem pusher biplane with a canard elevator and the engine in front of its two occupants. It is not known how ‚Äì or even if ‚Äì this machine ever flew.Philip Jarrett, Lost and Found, The Aeroplane, June 2011, p. 50. Blackburn gained Royal Aero Club pilot's certificate no. 79 at Brooklands on 9 May 1911, flying a Bristol Boxkite.Royal Aero Club Year Book 1911, p. 29. In 1912 Harold Blackburn helped establish a motorcycle manufacturing business with C. S. and E. A. Burney. When the first machines were successful the business was incorporated as Burney and Blackburn Ltd., although at this point Blackburn sold his stake. Despite his absence the business built motorcycles and engines under the brand name 'Blackburne'. As a \\"dividend\\" for his investment, Harold Blackburn was given a motorcycle and sidecar which he later used to promote flying displays in Yorkshire. In September 1912 aircraft constructor Robert Blackburn (no relation to Harold Blackburn) moved his flying school from Filey Bay in Yorkshire to Hendon. Harold Blackburn was appointed instructor and test pilot. The school's activities were reported in Flight magazine but it ceased operations some time in early 1913. Harold Blackburn became a demonstration pilot for Robert Blackburn's latest aircraft, the Blackburn Type D single-seat monoplane (which survives in flying condition with the Shuttleworth Collection) and its two-seat derivative, the Blackburn Type I. The Type I was demonstrated extensively throughout Yorkshire in the late summer of 1913 by Blackburn and its owner, Dr. M. G. Christie. They visited locales that had seen little or nothing of flying, such as Bridlington where Blackburn took 9-year-old American Isla Tudor up to a height of .Bridlington Free Press, 29 August 1913. Tudor became known as the \\"Little Air Lady\\".Such was Tudor's notoriety for this and other ascents that when she died of appendicitis she received an obituary in The New York Times on 25 September 1916. She was 12 years old. On 2 October 1913 Blackburn and Dr. Christie won the Wars of the Roses air race, a competition sponsored by the Yorkshire Evening News between the Yorkshire-built Type I monoplane and the Lancashire-built Avro 504 biplane, piloted by F. P. Raynham with Humphrey Verdon Roe as passenger. The race began evenly but in deteriorating conditions Raynham missed a checkpoint, handing the race to the Yorkshire crew. For the Yorkshire Agricultural Show at Bradford on 22 July 1914 the Yorkshire Evening News established the Great Yorkshire Show Air Line, inaugurating \\"the first air-line service in Great Britain between cities flying to a time table\\" with half-hourly flights between Leeds and Bradford using the Blackburn Type I piloted by Harold Blackburn. The first passenger was Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, the Lady Mayoress of Leeds. =Wartime service= Upon the outbreak of World War I Harold Blackburn joined the Royal Flying Corps, receiving his Certificate 'B‚Äô (no. 214) from the Central Flying School at Upavon, Wiltshire, on 19 August 1914. He flew in combat in France during that year.Excerpts of letters from Harold Blackburn to his brother were published in Flight, 6 November 1914, p. 1104, and 20 November 1914, p. 1138. In 1915 he assumed command of 'C‚Äô Flight of No. 14 Squadron which was then under formation. The squadron commenced operations in the Sinai and Palestine campaign in November 1915, defending the Suez Canal from Turkish invasion. Blackburn received the Military Cross and also designed a bombsight which 2nd Lieutenant Cedric Waters Hill successfully used to destroy the water tank of the remote Turkish outpost at Bir el Hassana on 26 February 1916. Blackburn was given command of No. 22 (Reserve) Squadron in Egypt though he later saw further service in England and France, for which he received the Air Force Cross Blackburn achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was mentioned in despatches four times, including a special commendation for his work in the Palestinian campaign from General Sir Archibald Murray. =Post-war service= Blackburn remained in the Royal Air Force after the war. He was second-in-command at RAF Henlow, until September 1924, when he left to become base commander at the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A. & A.E.E.) at Martlesham Heath in Suffolk, a position he held until November 1928. Retirement and death Blackburn retired from the RAF in 1929 with the rank of Wing Commander and moved to Jersey. He was evacuated during World War II but returned to the island, where he died in 1959. He is buried at Trinity Church with his second wife Ruth Morley.

It had been estimated that child labour accounted for 22% of the workforce in Asia, 32% in Africa, 17% in Latin America, and 1% in the United States, Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations. Child labour in Nigeria is the employment of children under the age of 18 in a manner that restricts or prevents them from basic education and development. Child labour is pervasive in every state of the country. In 2006, the number of child workers was estimated at about 15 million. Poverty is a major factor that drives child labour in Nigeria. In poor families, child labour is a major source of income for the family. Nigeria is a male dominated society in which males are considered superior to their female counterpart. Current status UNICEF Nigeria is active for children's rights. Child workers include street vendors, shoe shiners, apprentice mechanics, carpenters, vulcanisers, tailors, barbers and domestic servants. Many working children are exposed to dangerous and unhealthy environments. In August, 2003, the Nigerian government formally adopted three International Labour Organization conventions setting a minimum age for the employment of children. The government also has implemented West African Cocoa Agriculture Project (WACAP). There is a similar incidence of child labour in rural and urban Nigeria. The US Department of Labour in its 2010 report claims Nigeria is witnessing the worst forms of child labor, particularly in agriculture and domestic service. In rural areas, most children work in agriculture of products such as cassava, cocoa and tobacco. These children typically work long hours and for little pay, with their families. The report claims some children are exposed to pesticides and chemical fertilizers in cocoa and tobacco fields because of archaic farming practices or because they are deployed as forced labour without protective gear. Additionally, street children work as porters and scavengers, and a growing number of them engage in begging. The report claims commercial sexual exploitation of children, especially girls, is also occurring in some Nigerian cities, including Port Harcourt and Lagos. Trafficking There is trafficking of children in Nigeria. Child labour is more common among children of illiterates. On average, in the Southwestern zone of Nigeria, there is a higher work burden for working children. Boys tend to earn more. Girls' non- participation in schooling is more likely affected by parents' lack of interest than boys'. Non-participation in school is related to poverty. About one third of working children obtain no benefit from their employer. Child labour among pupils frequently impairs schooling.

Some states granted full adoption rights to same- sex couples, while others banned it entirely or only allowed the partner in a same-sex relationship to adopt the biological child of the other partner. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court struck down all bans on same-sex marriage in the United States. On March 31, 2016, a Federal District Court struck down Mississippi's ban on same-sex couples from adoption. On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed an Arkansas Supreme Court ruling and ordered all states to treat same-sex couples equally to opposite-sex couples in the issuance of birth certificates. These court rulings have made adoption by same-sex couples legal in all 50 states. LGBTQ people continue to face moral judgment about whether they are suitable parents. The context of same-gender adoption allows for a reworking of the construct of the modern family and the negotiation of parenting identities moving beyond the traditional system based on the gender binary.  LGBT parenting  On April 6, 1999, the American Civil Liberties Union produced an Overview of Lesbian and Gay Parenting, Adoption and Foster Care. Within this document, the organization addressed research results on Lesbian and Gay Parenting, some key findings include: * There is no evidence to suggest that lesbians and gay men are unfit to be parents * Home environments with lesbian and gay parents are as likely to successfully support a child's development as those with heterosexual parents * Good parenting is not influenced by sexual orientation. Rather, it is influenced most profoundly by a parent's ability to create a loving and nurturing home ‚Äì an ability that does not depend on whether the parent is gay or straight * There is no evidence to suggest that the children of lesbian and gay parents are less intelligent, suffer from more problems, are less popular, or have lower self-esteem than children of heterosexual parents * The children of lesbian and gay parents grow up as happy, healthy, and well-adjusted as the children of heterosexual parents. Many families in which a child would have parents who identified as lesbian or gay and then grew up in a same-sex relationship were those brought about from a previous heterosexual relationship. As such, many prior legal disputes were over the custody of a child in cases of a divorce. Biases were then seen against the parent in a now same-sex relationship which caused courts to not favor them in giving custody and visitation rights. The sexual preference of the LGBT parent was viewed as impacting the upbringing of the child and not the actual ability to provide for the child's needs. Following the introduction of In vitro fertilisation, lesbian couples were able to rear children of their own who weren't born from heterosexual relationships and the child being the biological offspring of one of the partners. Sprouting from this is the development of the issues of co- parent adoption and, in cases of separation, child custody in some lesbian relationships. For male same-sex couples, becoming a parent can be more costly, as if there is a desire to have a biological child of one of the partners, the only method is surrogacy. As such, adoption serves as a more cost-effective alternative.  Professional organizations  \\"Call to Action!\\" ‚ÄúCall to Action! Foster and Adopt Our Children‚Äù was hosted by Let it Be Us which focused on finding foster and adoptive families within the Chicago‚Äôs LGBTQ community in July 2016. Over 150 people who attended the event had experienced the difficulty of adopting in Chicago. The other half were agencies throughout the Chicagoland area such as ChildServ, Hephzibah, Children‚Äôs Association, Illinois Center for Adoption and Permanency, Kaleidoscope, Inc., Lakeside Community Committee, Lawerence Hall, Little Children‚Äôs Villages of Illinois, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), Pride Action Tank, user Youth Exploring Spirituality and Windy City Times. Speakers were invited up to take the podium, such as ‚ÄúIllinois DCFS Director George Sheldon spoke on the topic of diligent recruitment in Illinois director of strategic initiatives at Lawerence Hall Renee Lehocky spoke about the history and mission of the ‚ÄúCall to Action! Foster and Adopt Our Children‚Äù collaborative; Mark Wilson spoke about his and his partner Bryan Northup‚Äôs experience as foster parents to four children ranging from 15 months-old to young adults and each of their experiences.‚Äù Professional organizations that support gay and lesbian families adoption include: Child Welfare League of America, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). These organizations fight for gay and lesbians couples to get the rights of adoption to be proposed as a redefined ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù As mentioned by Drcuker and Raymond in the article ‚ÄúAdoptive Homes and the Meaning of Family: Implications for Gay and Lesbian Prospective‚Äù children of gay and lesbian families are often subject to teasing and harassment within their peer group. Population  More recently, the amount of same-sex couples adopting in the 21st century has tripled since the 1990s. U.S. Census data from 2010 revealed an emerging trend in American adoptions; despite considerable prejudice in some quarters and legal barriers in states, same-sex couples are adopting children in growing numbers. According to these figures, of the 115,064 same-sex households with children, about 16 percent or 18,400 were bringing up one or more adopted children, and 11 percent from the figures are gay male couples. According to the Williams Institute, as of 2009: \\"an estimated 20,000 same-sex couples are raising nearly 30,000 adopted children.\\" As of 2011, approximately two million children in the United States were being raised by LGBT parents and unable to establish a legal relationship with both their LGBT parents. The 2010 U.S. Census reported that same-gender couples are raising approximately 115,000 children 18 years and younger and are living in essentially all counties of the United States.Perrin, E. C. (2013, March 21). AAP policy: No relationship between parents' sexual orientation and children's well-being. American Academy of Pediatrics News. Retrieved from content/early/2013/03/21/aapnews.20130321-1.full. pdf+html Professional assessments A consensus has developed among the medical, psychological, and social welfare communities that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents.United States District Court District of Massachusetts July 8, 2010 The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology. Based on the robust nature of the evidence available in the field, the Third District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida was satisfied in 2010 that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise; the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.Third District Court of Appeal State of Florida - September 22, 2010 (PDF) The most important factors in maintaining the welfare of a child is more dependent on the socioeconomic status and not as dependent on the gender and sexuality of the parents. Issues are brought about from uncontrolled factors such as discrimination or the inability of parents to get married. A common fear of many persons who oppose the rearing of children by a homosexual couple will result in the child becoming homosexual themselves. However, this is not the case as when comparing children from heterosexual parents to those raised with same-sex parents there is no increase in the number of children who identify as homosexual. However, there are differences seen as children from same-sex relationships tend to not conform to traditional gender roles, which is sometimes used as another argument brought about by opponents of same-sex adoption. In a study done by Goldberg, Kinkler, Richardson and Downing, the effects of Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Couples in Open Adoptions were examined through a qualitative study. Because little research has been focused on the effects of gender and sexual orientation in open adoption relationships. Data from 90 individuals, (30 women in 15 lesbian relationships; 30 men in 15 gay relationships, and 15 women and 15 men in heterosexual relationships were analyzed). All couples were adopting their first child, and the parents were all first-time parents. This study was done within the borders of the United States. Participants filled out a questionnaire, and a telephone interview within the first 3‚Äì4 months of receiving a child. All participants were between the ages of 27 and 52 (average 37.7), and 90% Caucasian. The results were qualitative in nature, relying on truthfulness of the participants' answers. The results emphasized that gay and lesbian couples emphasized the philosophy of openness and it relates to their own desire to pursue adoption without hiding their sexual orientation. The birth mother was the consistent member of the birth family that kept in touch with the adoptive family. The birth mother was a driving force shaping open adoption relationships. One of the downsides to this study is that there was no long-term interview or follow-up as the child progressed in an open adoption. It does show that there is no great apprehension from the birth family to the adoptive family because of sexual orientation. Public opinion A 2007 poll by CNN and Opinion Research Corporation found that 57% of respondents felt same-sex couples should have the right to adopt and 40% that they should not. More recently, a Gallup poll from May 2014 found 63% of respondents believed same-sex couples should have the legal right to adopt a child. From 1994 to 2012, seven national polling organizations asked certain representative sections of Americans their opinions regarding the legalization of same-sex adoption, with the main question being: \\"Do you think there should or should not be adoption rights for gays and lesbians so they can legally adopt children?\\" Survey results from 1994 to 2012 indicate an increase in support. Of those surveyed in 1994, only one in four (28 percent) favored adoption, compared with more than five in ten in 2012. From 1994 to 1999, only one in three favored adoption; from 2002 to 2008, support increased to four in 10. From 2009 to 2012, a full majority (52 percent to 61 percent) approved of the legalization of same-gender adoption. It was shown that younger people expressed more support than people over 65. It was also found that 85% of the Democrats asked were in support of same-sex adoption, while only 23% of the Republicans asked were in support of it. In June 2018, a YouGov poll found that over half of Americans (55%) said they believe heterosexual and homosexual couples can be equally good parents. Majorities also said they were in support of gay (53%) and lesbian (55%) couples having the right to adopt and raise children. When asked whether gay and straight couples can be equally good parents, 38% of people ‚Äústrongly‚Äù agreed, making this the most popular response. Women (47%) were significantly more likely than men (30%) to ‚Äústrongly‚Äù agree with this statement. However, a majority of people (57%) also said they believed that a child should be raised by both a mother and a father. Another 15% ‚Äústrongly‚Äù or ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù disagreed with that idea. In this case, men (47%) were far more likely than women (30%) to ‚Äústrongly‚Äù agree with the statement that children should be raised by a mother and father. When asked if they thought lesbian couples should be able to adopt and raise children, 55% said yes and 29% said no. When asked about gay male couples, 53% saying yes and 32% saying no. In both instances, women were significantly more likely than men to say yes. Almost half of Americans (47%) said that it was unfair that child-welfare agencies can refuse to place a child with a same-sex couple based on religious objection, while one-third (33%) said it was fair. (46%) were also in support of a Connecticut initiative to recruit members of the LGBT community to become foster and adoptive parents, though another 29% said they thought it was a bad idea. Politics On July 29, 1999, U.S. Representative Steve Largent introduced amendment 356 () to the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2000 () that would have banned joint adoption between individuals who are not related by blood or marriage in Washington, D.C. The amendment failed with 213 votes in favor and 215 opposed. In 2004, Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida, was quoted saying: \\"[I]t is in the best interest of adoptive children, many of whom come from troubled and unstable backgrounds, to be placed in a home anchored both by a father and a mother.\\" On May 10, 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told an interviewer: \\"And if two people of the same gender want to live together, want to have a loving relationship, or even to adopt a child ‚Äì in my state individuals of the same sex were able to adopt children. In my view, that's something that people have a right to do.\\" Asked the next day to reconcile that with his opposition to same-sex marriage, he said: \\"Well actually I think all states but one allow gay adoption, so that's a position which has been decided by most of the state legislators, including the one in my state some time ago. So I simply acknowledge the fact that gay adoption is legal in all states but one.\\" Currently, there are legal appeals in a number of states to allow for co-parent adoption, commonly known as second parent adoption, whereby one parent can adopt the child of the biological child of their same sex partner, without voiding their partner of parental guardianship over the child. This allows the child to be recognised as having two legal parents in cases where the couple is not in a relationship recognised by the state. Gay and Lesbian Policy: * Made on state than federal level and are dictated by statuses, agency regulations, and court opinions, which can be fueled by political ideologies (Kenyon 2003). For the states that let gay couples adoptive require that adoptive couples must be married; the states that don‚Äôt have specific states laws this issue is addressed based on the best interest of the child-Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 Legal status 450pxthumbStatewide same sex protections in adoption laws in the United States =Law on same-sex adoption= On May 16, 2013, the Every Child Deserves a Family Act was introduced to Congress, but was never enacted. This act would have stipulated that any organization that deals with the foster and adoptive care of children and has some form of funding from the federal government could not discriminate against \\"prospective adoptive or foster parents solely on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status or on the basis of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the child involved.\\" However, as the bill introduced only applied to centers that are federally funded, private institutions would still have been able to refuse same-sex couples from adopting. In January 2019, the state of South Carolina applied for and was granted a wavier that allowed adoption agencies to block same sex couples form adopting or becoming foster parents. A Greenville couple has filed a lawsuit in this case, the outcome of which is pending. =Cases= Alabama On October 12, 2012, an anonymous Alabama Court of Civil Appeals turned down the request of a woman to adopt her same-sex spouse's child. The couple had been married in California. The court held that Alabama law did not recognize the women as spouses. On September 18, 2015, the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed lower courts that recognized an adoption judgment granted to a same-sex couple over their three children in 2007 by the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. The court ruled that the Georgia state court misapplied Georgia state law in granting the adoption. In the case of V.L. v. E.L.. E.L., biological mother of the three children, who sought to reverse an order recognizing the adoption decree, argued the Georgia decree was void based upon that court lacking subject matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Alabama agreed, voiding the decree's recognition in-state and nullifying the parental rights of V.L. On November 16, V.L. petitioned the United States Supreme Court to stay the order stripping her of her parental rights and to allow her to see her children during the appeals process. On December 14, the Supreme Court granted her request for a stay of the ruling pending their disposition of V.L.'s petition for a writ of certiorari. This is the first adoption case that has made it to the Supreme Court since Obergefell was decided. On March 7, 2016, the United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Supreme Court of Alabama. The court ruled that the Alabama Supreme Court was incorrect when it refused to recognize the adoption decree from Georgia, ruling that the Full Faith and Credit Clause had been violated. The court's decision had the effect of the adoption decree from Georgia being recognized in Alabama, and V.L.'s parental rights being restored. The case was remanded to the Supreme Court of Alabama for further proceedings. Arkansas On November 4, 2008, Arkansas voters approved Act 1, a measure to ban anyone \\"cohabitating outside of a valid marriage\\" from being foster parents or adopting children. Although the law could apply to heterosexual couples, it was believed to have been written to target gay couples due to the fact that same-sex marriage was prohibited in that state, thereby making an adoption impossible.Gay-Adoption Ban Passes in Arkansas Single gay men and lesbians were still allowed to adopt in Arkansas. The law was overturned on April 16, 2010 by state judge Chris Piazza. The Arkansas Supreme Court in Arkansas Department of Human Services v. Cole upheld the lower court's decision on April 7, 2011. In Arkansas, state Circuit Judge Tim Fox of Pulaski County ruled on December 1, 2015, that a state law restricting parental identification on birth certificates to heterosexual couples was unconstitutional. His ruling initially applied only to the three couples who originally sued in this case, Pavan v. Smith. Two days later, he broadened the ruling to apply statewide. On December 10, 2015, the Supreme Court of Arkansas stayed the statewide applicability, but allowed the three plaintiff couples to receive their amended certificates. On December 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of Arkansas reversed the trial court's order. On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari sought by the plaintiff parents and reversed the Arkansas Supreme Court. The Court held by a 6-3 vote that Arkansas' law only allowing for opposite-sex couples to be named on their children's birth certificates was an unconstitutional breach of their ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Florida In Florida, a 1977 law prohibited adoption by homosexuals following the anti-gay Save Our Children campaign led by Anita Bryant. In November 2008, a state circuit court struck down the law in In re: Gill, a case involving a gay male couple raising two foster children placed with them in 2004 by state child welfare workers. On appeal, on September 22, 2010, Florida's Third District Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the decision of the lower court. The state did not appeal. The 1977 law that banned homosexuals from adoption was repealed on July 1, 2015. In Florida, a case was brought before federal District Judge Robert Hinkle of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The Florida Department of Health refused to issue a birth certificate recognizing both partners in a same-sex relationship. The plaintiffs in the case asked Judge Hinkle to declare this policy unconstitutional. He set a deadline of January 6, 2016, for the Department of Health to reply to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. In January 2017, Florida reached a settlement with the plaintiffs, agreeing to issue correct birth certificates to all married same-sex couples on an equal basis. Idaho In 2013, a lesbian couple, married in California but now living in Idaho, petitioned for second-parent adoption. A state magistrate denied the petition on the grounds that Idaho did not recognize their marriage. On appeal, the Idaho Supreme Court unanimously reversed the magistrate's ruling because Idaho has no specific statutory ban on unmarried second-parent adoption. Indiana In Indiana, there are two cases pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ‚Äì one filed in February 2015, and one in December 2015 ‚Äì against a policy identical to Florida's. The February case deals with issues more specific to the ruling by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case Wolf v. Walker due to the fact Obergefell had not yet been decided. The December case cites Obergefell as reason for ordering the state to list both parents in a same-sex relationship on birth certificates. No action has been made in either case. Kansas In November 2012, the Kansas Court of Appeals ruled in the case In the Matter of the Adoption of I. M. that a single person who is not a biological parent of a child cannot petition to adopt that child without terminating the other parent's parental rights. Since Kansas does not recognize same-sex marriages, this ruling effectively prevents same- sex couples from second-parent adoption in Kansas. However, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled on February 22, 2013, in Frazier v. Goudschaal that a partner of a biological parent is entitled to parental rights.http://www.kscourts.org/Cases-and- Opinions/Opinions/SupCt/2013/20130222/103487.pdf Michigan In December 2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that the state's adoption code permits second parent adoptions by same-sex couples. A female same-sex couple, who were raising three children, who adopted one of them, filed a lawsuit in federal court in January 2012 seeking to have the state's ban on adoption by same-sex couples overturned. and in September amended that suit to challenge the state's ban on same-sex marriage as well. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately ruled in their favor in Obergefell v. Hodges. Mississippi 33% of Mississippi's households headed by same-sex couples include a child, the highest such percentage in the nation. Nevertheless, Mississippi's Domestic Relations Code states: \\"Adoption by couples of the same gender is prohibited.\\"Mississippi Statutes Annotated ¬ß 93-17-3(5) A lawsuit, Campaign for Southern Equality v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, was filed in August 2015 by four Mississippi same-sex couples seeking to overturn this law. The plaintiffs in that case are represented by Roberta Kaplan, who successfully argued United States v. Windsor before the U.S. Supreme Court. Mississippi was the only U.S. state to not have legal joint adoption rights for LGBT couples; the only other jurisdictions under U.S. sovereignty where this is the case are American Samoa and some Native American tribal nations. In Mississippi, a state law passed in 2000 explicitly prohibits same-sex couples from joint adoption. After Obergefell, Mississippi has specifically stated the ban is still in effect. On August 12, 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center joined by four same-sex couples raising children filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi seeking to declare the statute unconstitutional.http://www.southernequality.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/08/15-08-12-COMPLAINT.pdf On March 31, 2016, Judge Daniel P. Jordan III issued a preliminary injunction striking down Mississippi's ban on same-sex couples from adoption, ruling the ban violates the Equal Protection Clause. There were no immediate plans by the state of Mississippi to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Nebraska Three same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the state on August 27, 2013, seeking the right to serve as foster and adoptive parents. It claimed that the state's policy against allowing two unrelated adults to adopt has been consistently enforced only against same-sex couples. New York An October 2012 court ruling in a custody dispute between two women in a same- sex relationship awarded custody to the adoptive parent rather than the biological mother. Wisconsin In Wisconsin, the state has allowed both parents to be on the birth certificate, but refuses to change the wordage from \\"father and mother\\" to a gender-neutral \\"parent 1 and parent 2.\\" In another case, a couple was outright rejected in their request. A federal lawsuit has been filed challenging this refusal. There is also a state lawsuit, Torres v. Rhoades, challenging the birth certificate wordage. On November 4, a judge dismissed Torres because the couple initiated the case as an adoption, but the judge ruled they didn't properly attack the constitutionality of the statutes that used the term \\"father and mother\\" or \\"husband and wife.\\" On November 17, the Second District Court of Appeal in Wisconsin agreed with the lower court. The couple could now appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin or they could go back to the trial court with a case challenging the constitutionality of the statutes that require the terms \\"father and mother.\\" References Additional sources Adoption Adoption in the United States ","title":"LGBT adoption in the United States"},{"id":"36523297","text":"Dmitri Stajila (born 2 August 1991) is a Moldovan football goalkeeper who currently plays for La√ßi in the Albanian Superliga.

Before serving as the current Secretary for the Environment, Wong had held a number of public service positions, including the first Chairman of the Environment and Sustainable Development Committee of the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Chairman of the Professional Green Building Council and the Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Green Building Council. He has contributed to the promotion and research of the standards and guidelines for sustainable built environment applicable to the high-density urban environment of Hong Kong.  Policy Vision  Wong as the Secretary for the Environment has introduced a number of policy blueprints to establish the direction, targets and roadmaps for policies on air quality, waste reduction and recycling, nature conservation, climate change and energy. These blueprints include: * March 2013, \\"A Clean Air Plan for Hong Kong\\"; * May 2013, \\"Hong Kong Blueprint for Sustainable Use of Resources 2013‚Äì2022\\"; * February 2014, \\"A Food Waste & Yard Waste Plan for Hong Kong 2014‚Äì2022\\"; * May 2015, \\"Energy Saving Plan for Hong Kong‚Äôs Built Environment 2015‚Äì2025+\\"; * November 2015, ‚ÄúHong Kong Climate Change Report 2015‚Äù; * December 2016, \\"Hong Kong Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 2016‚Äì2021\\"; * January 2017, \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs Climate Action Plan 2030+\\". Air quality To improve the air quality, Wong implemented a set of new air quality objectives soon after his assumption of office, and launched the Air Quality Health Index to tie in with the new air quality objectives. On the other hand, a wide range of measures have been implemented targeting vehicles, vessels and power plants, which are the major sources of local air pollutants. Over $10 billion was set aside to launch a scheme in 2014 to phase out some 80 000 pre- Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles by 2020, and another $7 billion scheme will be launched in 2020 to phase out some 40 000 Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles. Starting from 2015, ocean-going vessels are required to switch to low-sulphur fuel while berthing in Hong Kong, making Hong Kong the first Asian city to implement mandatory fuel switch at berth. From 2019 onwards, vessels are further required to use low-sulphur fuel within Hong Kong waters to dovetail with the establishment of Asia‚Äôs first marine emission control area in the Mainland China. The power plants have also been continuously reducing the emission of air pollutants in order to meet the emissions caps set by the Government. The percentage of coal-fired electricity generation has been substantially reduced from about 50% in 2015 to about 25% in 2020. The overall air quality in Hong Kong has improved evidently in recent years. From 2014 to 2019, the ambient concentrations of major air pollutants, including respirable suspended particulates, fine suspended particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide, have dropped by 22% to 55%, whereas roadside concentrations of such air pollutants have also dropped by 22% to 44% . On the percentage of electric private cars among all private cars, 6.3% of newly registered private cars in Hong Kong are electric in 2019, higher than 3.9% of the Mainland China and other Asian economies such as South Korea (1.9%), Japan (0.5%) and Thailand (0.1%). As mentioned in the 2019 Policy Address, the Government will prepare for a $2 billion pilot subsidy scheme to subsidise the installation of electric vehicle charging-enabling infrastructure in car parks of existing private residential buildings. It is anticipated that the pilot scheme will run for about 3 years to cover roughly 60 000 private parking spaces. Waste reduction and recycling On waste management, the key strategies include: a) Introduce quantity-based waste charging through legislation based on the ‚Äúpolluter pays‚Äù principle and to encourage waste reduction at source: a bill was introduced into the Legislative Council (LegCo) for the first time in end 2018 . b) Implement producer responsibility schemes (PRS) for different products: Three pieces of legislation relating to PRS were passed between 2012 and 2017, covering plastic shopping bags, glass beverage containers, and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). The next target is plastic beverage containers, with the use of reverse vending machines to improve the efficiency of collecting plastic beverage containers. c) Encourage the public to reduce food waste at source: The Food Wise Hong Kong Campaign has been launched since 2013, with the Big Waster icon created; and have been established to provide information on ‚Äúfood wise and waste less‚Äù and other green messages; non-governmental organisations have been funded by the Environment and Conservation Fund (ECF) to promote surplus food donation. d) Promote waste separation and recovery: Clean Recycling Campaign has been rolled out in continuation of the ‚Äúblue for paper, yellow for aluminium cans, brown for plastic bottles‚Äù campaign launched about 20 years ago; a mobile application ‚ÄúWaste Less‚Äù has been developed to display over 7 000 recyclable collection points across the territory; a community recycling network comprising Community Green Stations (CGS) and Community Recycling Centres are being built up to enhance waste reduction and recycling in all districts in Hong Kong; a $1 billion Recycling Fund has been launched to support the recycling industry ; and the \\"Reduce and Recycle 2.0\\" Campaign was launched in June 2020 to introduce the enhanced service of the community recycling network, encourage the public to go green, and support circular economy and green recovery. e) Turn waste into energy: T‚ÄßPARK was built to treat sludge from the sewage treatment works and generate energy; a large scale advanced municipal solid waste incineration plant (the Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase 1) is being constructed near Shek Kwu Chau; a network of Organic Resources Recovery Centres (O‚ÄßPARKs) is being built in phases , and the trial on food waste/sewage sludge anaerobic co-digestion technology is being carried out at the Tai Po Sewage Treatment Works to transform food waste into renewable energy. Around 13 000 tonnes of food waste were recovered to turn waste into energy in 2018, increasing to 28 000 tonnes in 2019. It is expected that food waste recycling will be extended to include part of the domestic food waste in 2020, with an estimated recovery amount of 45 000 tonnes. There will be two more food waste treatment facilities in the coming two to three years: at Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works where food waste/sewage sludge anaerobic co-digestion will be introduced, and O‚ÄßPARK2 in North District . f) Turn waste into resources: The government-funded WEEE‚ÄßPARK, which commenced operation in October 2017, adopts state-of-the-art technologies for proper recycling and treatment of locally generated WEEE. As at July 2020, WEEE‚ÄßPARK has processed about 1.75 million pieces of WEEE, including about 412 000 washing machines, 200 000 refrigerators, 297 000 televisions, 166 000 air-conditioners and 673 000 computer products, turning waste into resources. Proposals for yard waste management are also introduced to turn yard waste into energy and resources. g) Support waste paper and plastic recycling: The Government engaged a number of service contractors in July 2020 to collect waste paper across the territory for screening, sorting and exporting to other places for recycling; a 2-year pilot scheme was launched in 2020 in three districts to provide free collection of a wide range of plastic recyclables from non-commercial and non-industrial sources in the districts, such as public and private housing estates, schools, CGSs and Community Recycling Centres. Nature conservation An ordinance was enacted by the LegCo in 2013 to incorporate the country park enclaves of Tai Long Sai Wan (Sai Wan), Kam Shan and Yuen Tun into their respective country parks, increasing the area of country parks by about 38 hectares. In 2016, the Environment Bureau and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department completed the first city- level Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Hong Kong. In June 2017, the Government announced its in-principle agreement to conserving a private land with very high ecological value in Sha Lo Tung through non-in-situ land exchange, with a view to conserving this area renowned for having marshes and streams among woodland and being a sanctuary for dragonflies. The Government amended the relevant ordinance in May 2018 to progressively phase out local ivory trade by the end of 2021, and to increase penalties on smuggling of and illegal trade in endangered species to deter the related activities. The Environmental Protection Department established the Countryside Conservation Office in July 2018, and earmarked $1 billion to support minor improvement works in the remote countryside, as well as the countryside conservation and revitalisation projects conducted by non-profit making organisations. In addition, the Southwest Lantau Marine Park, covering an area of about 650 hectares, has formally become the sixth marine park in Hong Kong with effect from 1 April 2020. This is conducive to providing a better habitat for marine life such as the Chinese white dolphins. Climate change To implement the Paris Agreement, the HKSAR Government has set a target that by 2030, carbon intensity should be lower than the 2005 level by 65% to 70%. By then, the per capita carbon emissions will be reduced to 3.3-3.8 tonnes per year. Figures show that Hong Kong‚Äôs carbon emissions peaked in 2014. The per capita carbon emissions also decreased from 6.2 tonnes (peak) in 2014 to 5.4 tonnes in 2018, and are anticipated to decrease further to 4.5 tonnes in 2020. The Government has invited the Council for Sustainable Development to engage the public to help formulate a longer-term decarbonisation strategy. Meanwhile, a $200 million Green Tech Fund has been set up to promote local R&D; on decarbonisation and green technologies. Energy The Energy Saving Plan for the Built Environment 2015~2025+ published by the Government in 2015 sets a specific energy saving target: reducing the energy intensity by 40% by 2025, using 2005 as the base. So far, a reduction of more than 30% has been achieved. In order to meet this target, the Government has introduced a series of measures, including providing tax concession for energy-efficient and renewable energy installations, raising the statutory energy efficiency standards of buildings and electrical appliances, constructing district cooling systems and promoting retro- commissioning and other innovations that help existing buildings to save energy. The Government also actively promotes renewable energy. Since 2018, it has introduced Feed-in Tariff (FiT), and implemented a number of facilitation measures, including relaxing the restrictions on the installation of solar energy generation systems on the rooftops of ‚Äúvillage houses‚Äù, exempting individuals participating in the FiT Scheme from applying for business registration and paying related profits tax, and launching Solar Harvest to install solar energy generation systems for schools and welfare organisations free of charge. As at the end of June 2020, the two power companies had approved more than 8 600 FiT applications in total. The solar panels involved can cover about 95 standard football pitches, and the electricity generated annually can support about 38 000 families, which is more than half the number of domestic households in Wan Chai. The Government has also taken the lead in installing renewable energy facilities at its premises (including reservoirs and landfills) and strengthening its effort to turn waste to energy. In 2017, Wong launched a blog (SEN‚Äôs Blog) to brief the public on the latest progress of his policy initiatives with the help of video clips and images.
