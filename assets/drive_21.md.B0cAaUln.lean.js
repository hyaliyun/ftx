The track's lyrics deal with sexual frustration and the restlessness associated with getting older (Townshend had turned 30 in 1975), while the music features a bass solo from John Entwistle. A live version recorded in Swansea, Wales on 12 June 1976 appears on the reissue of The Who by Numbers and the Thirty Years of Maximum R&B; box set, while the 9 December 1975 version from Cleveland was included in the Thirty Years of Maximum R&B; Live video and DVD. In an interview from Thirty Years of Maximum R&B; Live, Townshend declared \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\" as one of his least favorite songs to play onstage (referring to it as a \\"fresh turd\\" at the conclusion of song's performance at the band's one-off show at Kilburn in December 1977); in humorous contrast, John Entwistle, claimed in the same series of interviews that \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\" was one of his favorite songs to perform. Lyrics and music The original title of \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\" was \\"Control Myself\\". Self-control is the theme of this song, as it is of another song on the album, \\"However Much I Booze\\". On the earlier song the singer laments his inability to control his drinking; on this song he chastises himself for being unable to control his sexual urges. The song's introduction includes high-pitched guitar chords that Pete Townshend found tricky to play. The end of the song includes a bass guitar solo for John Entwistle. Critical reception Record Mirror regarded \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\" as one of the highlights of The Who by Numbers. Critic Chris Charlesworth regards it as one of the Who's best songs. Authors Steve Grantley and Alan G. Parker praise Keith Moon's drumming and especially John Entwistle's \\"nimble-fingered\\" bass guitar playing. Charlesworth concurs that Entwistle's bass solo is \\"a stunning display of virtuosity\\". Live history \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\" debuted onstage in October 1975 and remained a staple in the band's act through 1976 and the band's one-off show at Kilburn in December 1977 (later issued as The Who at Kilburn: 1977). It was one of only two songs from The Who By Numbers that appeared regularly in the set list for the Who's tour backing the album in 1975 and 1976. It then appeared sporadically from 1979-1981 (when Kenney Jones was the band's drummer) and was referenced one more time in 1997 during an acoustic version of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". As in the studio version, live renditions always showcased an Entwistle bass solo. A live version of the song from June 12, 1976 was included on 30 Years of Maximum R&B.; Charlesworth finds this performance \\"faultless\\", particularly praising the vocal harmonies and Entwistle's \\"immaculate bass solo\\". However, Pete Townshend states this and \\"Sister Disco\\" are his least favourite songs to perform, despite their high critical and commercial acclaim.

Plot The unassuming pet photographer, Bryan Lighthouse (Dave Annable) is thrown into a serious action and romance adventure when he is forced to marry Masha Nikitin (Katharine McPhee) to pay a debt to her criminal parents against his will. Masha's father Vlatko (Ken Davitian) marries her to Bryan to get her a green card, under the condition that Bryan cannot touch her. Off to spend their honeymoon at a remote tropical resort somewhere in Tahiti, Masha's former boyfriend Brick (Vinnie Jones), who is in love with her (although she does not return the feeling), follows them. After Masha catches Bryan dancing with a hotel waitress, she storms off, as it is hinted she hates womanizers. Feeling bad, the waitress Lani (Tia Carrere) suggests Bryan take Masha on a romantic outing, to a secret beach encased by a tropical rainforest to make it up to her. While teasing Bryan at the secret cove, Masha flees into the rainforest and is kidnapped. Bryan searches for Masha back at the hotel, unaware she has been kidnapped. He then finds that his psychotic assistant, Tonya (Mena Suvari), who is in love with him, has tracked him down to the resort. Tonya has brought condoms and tries to have sex with him. After Bryan informs her that he does not want to have sex with her, Tonya agrees to help find Masha, but tells him that she will one day force him to have sex with her, after trying to have sex with him one more time. After receiving a call from Masha's kidnappers demanding a ransom, Bryan asks Lani for help. While Bryan, Lani, and Tonya are making plans, Brick storms in and Lani and Tonya escape off the balcony, leaving Bryan to face Brick's wrath. When Brick finds a condom Tonya had brought on the unmade, wrecked bed, he assumes that Bryan had attempted to take Masha's virginity and hits him. Bryan barely escapes, while Brick calls Masha's father back in the USA and informs him of Masha's kidnapping, making it sound as if Bryan had been the kidnapper. Meanwhile, the kidnappers turn out to be two American INS agents Agent Meyers (Howard Bishop) and Agent Ross (Kevin Dunn). Afterwards Brick tells Masha's father Vlatko about the condom and Bryan's supposed attempt to have sex with Masha, Vlatko becomes enraged and prepares to fly to the island. Lani calls her cousin, Ernesto (Rob Schneider) to help find Masha with his helicopter. A chase scene occurs between Brick and the four heroes (Bryan, Lani, Tonya, and Ernesto) and ends with the group making a hasty escape in Ernesto's helicopter, only to later crash-land by a fishing village. Deciding to rest on a beach at the edge of the village, Ernesto and Tonya kiss passionately, unconcerned of Masha's dire condition, and Lani and Bryan storm off in anger. Alone, Ernesto and Tonya almost have sex in a boat in the grass, but Brick soon shows up and knocks them out, revealing that Brick is in on the kidnapping. Separated, Lani and Bryan obliviously go in separate directions. Masha escapes her prison in a surfboard shack and finds Bryan, who is crazily driving a jeep stolen from Brick after he tried to kill Bryan. Bryan and Masha crash the jeep, which erupts into flames, and make an escape on foot. Finding a canoe on a river, they outrun the three culprits and find a friendly welcoming old-time village. After eating a huge dinner and dancing and having fun, Masha and Bryan have sex for the first time. The next morning, they awake to a cheering village. However, during breakfast the two agents and Brick find the village. Brick and the lovers battle on a steep ocean cliff. Just as Brick is ready to kill Bryan, Lani and Ernesto show up in the helicopter, catching Brick off guard. Masha, using the distraction, grabs Brick's gun and shoots him in the back: he falls off the cliff, taking Bryan with him. Masha is in shock, terrified with the thought that she killed Bryan too. Bryan appears in the waves, unharmed, and they are reunited with Masha's family. Vlatko gives Bryan his blessing to marry Masha for real, but he declines despite his feelings for her. Masha, heartbroken, continues her old life taking dance lessons. One day, unable to concentrate on the dance routine she was practicing, Marsha leaves the dance studio to find Bryan outside ready to propose to her as he changed his mind. As the crowd around them applauds, the film ends with the camera panning away from the couple as they kiss.'You May Not Kiss the Bride' Official Facebook Page Cast * Dave Annable as Bryan Lighthouse, a pet photographer.

A revolutionary turned industrialist and later into a leading politician, he was instrumental in defining the Indian entity during the British Raj for his hometown, Serampore, a suburban settlement near Calcutta. He was born into one of the well-off families in Serampore, the Lahiri family. Ever since his childhood he had been an outstanding student. He went on to become the second Indian to complete his education from the University of California, Berkeley (USA). It was during his stay in Berkeley that Jitendra Nath developed a strong interest in nationalism. He went on to actively support the \\"Ghadar Group\\", with the objective to free India from British rule. Jitendra Nath through his Ghadar connections came in touch with Jatin Mukherjee, better known as \\"Bagha Jatin\\", one of the extremist leaders in the Indian Freedom movement. Jitendra Nath operated out of the underground units in Germany and was one of the key facilitators in connecting the Indian extremist units with the Helferrich brothers in Germany. The hope was to mobilize arms and ammunitions strategically with German help and strategically oust British from India. Although his name did not come up in the leading list of revolutionaries associated with the Christmas Day Plot of 1915, he played a significant role behind the scenes. He was on board of the Maverick, the vessel which was responsible for shipping arms and ammunitions into India. However, owing to the unfortunate capture of \\"Bagha Jatin\\", this mission was abandoned at the Bay of Bengal. Subsequently, Jitendra Nath went underground. But this failed attempt to make a difference in the Imperial India did not daunt the revolutionary spirits of Jitendra Nath. He envisioned that a strong socio-economic Indian entity would help in shaking up the Imperialist yoke. He then went on to use his academic training in polymer technology to establish India's first belting company, the Bengal Belting Company. He invested most of his family fortune for developing this factory and then went ahead to utilize all profit returns for the socio-economic development of Serampore. In fact, the huge employment opportunities created coupled with infrastructure developments that he brought in, helped in defining the industrial development of Serampore and surrounding towns. In his strife to spread industrial revolution in India, Jitendra Nath joined Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray. When the Indian Chemical Council was formed in the 1938 under the leadership of the Acharya, Jitendra Nath became one of its early members. Subsequently, he was elected to preside over the council in 1943-44. The revolutionary in Jitendra Nath inspired him to take up a political career in his march ahead to change the face of Serampore. Highly influenced by the radical philosophies of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Ray, he joined the Indian National Congress. He continued to be an active member of the party before and after the Indian independence. He was elected as a member of the Indian Parliament during the first two general elections. Owing to his failing health, he retired from active politics in 1960s. However until his death in 1975, Jitendra Nath concentrated bringing in social reforms in his home town of Serampore.

This was the largest number of persons beatified at once up to that time. They originated from all parts of Spain but mostly served and died in the diocese of Valencia. Background The 233 martyrs were clergy, religious and lay persons of the diocese of Valencia who were executed during the Red Terror of the Spanish Civil War. Some 6,000 clergy and religious were executed in Spain during this period; of these over 2,000 have been proposed for canonization. Up to the present over 1,000 have been beatified and 11 canonized. They are regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War. The 233 martyrs were made up of 16 separate causes, mostly groups but also some individuals who have been proposed for canonization. The earliest cause was opened in 1952 (that of Tomas Sitjar Fortia and his companions). Most causes were opened in the 1950s, though none were accepted by the CCS until 1990. The most recent cause (Maria Giner Gomis) was opened in 1995 and completed in five years. This was not the first group of Spanish martyrs beatified by John Paul II, though it was the largest up to that time. Ceremony The beatifications were announced at a ceremony in Rome on 11 March 2001, presided over by Pope John Paul II. In his homily he preached on the Transfiguration and pointed to the example of the martyr's sacrifice, and urged the church in Spain to be worthy of their example. He observed that they were men and women of all ages, and states (clergy, religious, lay persons) and that they had been killed for professing their faith.Homily pt2.1 He pointed out that the martyrs had died forgiving their enemies, and expressed the hope that their example would help to remove the end of hatred and resentment still felt in Spain from those times.Homily pt3.2 Controversy The issue of the Spanish martyrs is controversial, not least because of the Spanish churches identification with the Nationalist cause during the civil war. However John Paul pointed out, generally and in specifics, that those who died in these cases ‚Äúwere not involved in political or ideological struggles nor did they want to be concerned with them‚Äù and that ‚Äúthey died solely for religious motives‚Äù.Homily pt3.1 Individuals  John Paul II made special mention of Maria Teresa Ferragud, one of the lay companions from Valencia; an 83-year-old woman, she was executed along with her four daughters (companions of Aurelio Ample Alcaide), all nuns in contemplative orders.Homily pt2.4 He also made special mention of Francesco Castello Aleu, a 22 yr old layman, and German Gozalba, at age 23 just 2 months into the priesthood. He also made reference to Consuela and Maria Dolores Aguiar-Mella, two lay companions of Maria Baldilou Bullit, and the first people from Uruguay to be beatified.Homily pt2.2 The 233 martyrs The 233 martyrs were advanced in 16 separate causes : * Jose Aparicio Sanz and 73 companions, clergy and laypersons of the Diocese of Valencia, including Amalia Abad Casasempere * Jacinto Serrano Lopez and 19 companions of the Dominican Order * Pascual Fortuna Almela and 4 companions of the Friars Minor * Alfonso Lopez Lopez and 6 companions of the Friars Minor Conventual * Aurelio Ample Alcaide and 16 companions of the Friars Minor Capuchin, * Josefa Masia Ferragud, a nun of the Discalced Augustinians * Tomas Sitjar Fortia and 11 companions of the Society of Jesus * Jose Calasanz Marques and 28 companions of the Salesian Society, and two Daughters of Mary * Vicente Cabanes Badenas and 18 companions of the Third Order of Friars Minor Capuchin * Mariano Garc√≠a M√©ndez (Juan Mar√≠a de la Cruz), a priest of the Sacred Heart of Jesus * Leonardo Olivera Buera and 5 companions of the Christian Brothers, also 24 Carmelite Sisters of Charity * Maria Ricart Olmos, a nun of the Servite Order * Maria Baldillou Bullit and 5 companions, nuns of the Sisters of the Pious Schools, and 2 laywomen of that order * Josefa Ruano Garcia and Dolores Puig Bonany, nuns of the Little Sisters of the Abandoned Elderly * Victoria Quintana Argos and 2 companions of the Capuchin Tertiary Sisters of the Holy Family * Maria Giner Gomis, a Claretian Sister * Francisco Castello y Aleu, layman of Catholic Action in Lleida Notes References * Martyrs of Valencia, at gcath * Homily by John Paul II External links * Martyrs of Spain, index page Category:20th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Spanish beatified people Category:Lists of Christian martyrs Category:Groups of Christian martyrs of the Late Modern era Category:Roman Catholic child blesseds Category:Executed children Category:Executed Spanish people Category:History of Catholicism in Spain Category:Martyred groups Category:Martyred Roman Catholic priests Category:Groups of Roman Catholic saints Category:People killed by the Second Spanish Republic Category:People killed in the Spanish Civil War Category:Persecution of Christians Category:Spanish Civil War Category:War crimes of the Spanish Civil War Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II ","title":"233 Spanish Martyrs"},{"id":"30520169","text":"No. 8 Air Experience Flight (8 AEF) is an Air Experience Flight based at RAF Cosford.

Self-portrait photographed using a tripod and timer.Daniel Meadows (born 1952) is an English photographer turned maker of digital stories, and a teacher of photography turned teacher of participatory media. Life and career as photographer Meadows was born in Great Washbourne, Gloucestershire, \\"in the middle of nowhere on the edge of the Cotswolds\\", on 28 January 1952. Both of his parents had Suffolk origins; his father was a land agent for the Dumbleton Estate, in which the family lived; his mother developed multiple sclerosis when Daniel was young and this gradually became more acute. He spent his early years without television.The Bus, 63‚Äì67; Meadows' description of Great Washbourne is on p.65. With Peter Fraser, Brian Griffin, Charlie Meecham and Martin Parr, Meadows studied at Manchester Polytechnic., PARC Projects, Photography and the Archive Research Centre. (Meadows' 1972 series June Street was a collaboration with Parr.Phil Coomes, \\"Daniel Meadows on digital literacy\\", BBC News in Pictures, 15 November 2011. Accessed 2 May 2012.) While a student he was particularly inspired by a lecture by Bill Jay (editor of Creative Camera and Album) and an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery of work by Bill Brandt. Meadows was living in the Moss Side area of Manchester during termtime, and was aware of its impending demolition. With its many small shops, Moss Side might, he thought, support a \\"picture shop\\", so he rented a barber's on Greame Street from January 1972, inviting people to come into the Free Photographic Shop to have their photographs taken for no charge. Two months later he had run out of money and had to close but had gained useful experience.Daniel Meadows, Living Like This, pp. 9‚Äì10. Double portrait from Barrow-in-Furness taken in October 1974 by Daniel Meadows. One of a series of portraits (sometimes referred to as National Portraits) which Meadows made from the Free Photographic Omnibus. The man on the left has been identified as James (or Jimmy) Connor (or O'Connor). On the right is David Balderstone. This picture appears on the front cover of the book Daniel Meadows: Edited Photographs from the 70s and 80s by Val Williams.Inspired by what Bill Jay had said about Benjamin Stone's travel around Britain by horse-drawn caravan, Meadows thought of a mobile version of the Greame Street studio; the Cliff Richard film Summer Holiday suggested a solution. He worked at Butlin's Holiday Camp at Filey during summer 1972 to pay for the publicity materials with which he hoped to get Arts Council and other funding for the purchase and one year's use of a double-decker bus.Meadows, Living Like This, p.12.David Allan Mellor, No Such Thing as Society: Photography in Britain 1967‚Äì87: From the British Council and the Arts Council Collection (London: Hayward, 2007), p.32. He succeeded and for 14 months from September 1973 travelled around England in the Free Photographic Omnibus, a 1947 Leyland PD1 bus whose seats had been removed to make space for a darkroom and living quarters: its windows were used as the gallery.Meadows, Living Like This, pp. 14, 16.The bus survives, in the possession of The Transport Museum, Wythall. In April 2014 it was described as \\"being renovated and restored\\" (\\"Daniel Meadows: Early Photographic Works\\", Royal Photographic Society). The Transport Museum shows the bus here (\\"From Our Collection: Barton JRR 404\\"), describing it as built in 1948. Meadows took this to twenty or more towns. Some of this work was published in Meadows' first book, Living Like This (1975), which combined Meadows' photographs and text with first-person accounts of those he had talked with. Among the photographs of this series is Portsmouth: John Payne, aged 12, with two friends and his pigeon, Chequer, 26 April 1974.The title has been given in various forms; this is how it appears on the copyright page and p.32 of No Such Thing as Society (2007). Payne, holding his pigeon in the centre of the photograph, told Meadows that he caught and bred pigeons.British Image 1, p.40 (the photograph appears opposite, and is titled John Payne from Portsmouth, aged 12); Living Like This, p.61 (the photograph appears on the same page, and, like many in the book, is not given a title). Paul Cabuts writes that: > The photograph, like many other photographs in the exhibition [No Such Thing > as Society], offers a window on a lost world, one that is difficult to > perceive without considerable culturally-specific contextualisation. > Meadows' photograph is however a masterstroke in providing clues about the > life and times of those recorded through his lens.

It was the cover photograph of the 1975 Arts Council anthology British Image 1 and the photograph on the poster for and catalogue of the 2008 travelling Hayward exhibition No Such Thing as Society. Meadows went on to photograph the northwest of England and Factory Records in the 1970s and in the 1980s to study the people of a middle-class London suburb (Bromley,Val Williams, Daniel Meadows: Edited Photographs from the 70s and 80s (Brighton: Photoworks, 2011), 220, 221, 224. although not specified at the time), the latter published as Nattering in Paradise. Career as teacher and digital storyteller Meadows became interested in teaching while photographing in Lancashire in the 1970s; in 1983 David Hurn invited him to help teach the Documentary Photography course at Newport College of Art and Design. From 1994 he has taught at Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies.David Alan Mellor, No Such Thing as Society: Photography in Britain 1967‚Äì1987: From the British Council and the Arts Council Collection (London: Hayward Publishing, 2007), 217.

Accessed 1 November 2010. Meadows' interest in participatory media was greatly influenced by Ivan Illich's ideas as presented in Tools for Conviviality; and his interest in digital storytelling influenced by, successively, Pedro Meyer's I Photograph to Remember, Meyer's ZoneZero website, and the NextExit website of Dana Atchley of the Center for Digital Storytelling (CDS) at UCB. Meadows taught an undergraduate course titled \\"Digital Storytelling and Photography\\" and also contemplated ways of adding digital storytelling to the website he was building about the Free Photographic Omnibus and the later lives of the people this had depicted. Meadows corresponded with Dana Atchley and arranged to attend one of the \\"boot camps\\" held by Atchley, Joe Lambert and Nina Mullen. Atchley was too ill to appear, but at the camp and a subsequent event at Ben Lomond he learned and exchanged ideas.Daniel Meadows, \\"The Electric Engagement\\", pp. 94‚Äì96 within Daniel Meadows and Jenny Kidd, \\"Capture Wales: The BBC Digital Storytelling Project\\"; in John Hartley and Kelly McWilliam, eds, Story Circle: Digital Storytelling around the World (Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley, 2009; ), pp. 91‚Äì117.Therese Nolan-Brown, (PDF), Queensland University of Technology, 10 May 2008.

It is located south of Grand Marais, Michigan. It was closed in 1957. History Grand Marais Air Force Station was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational in December 1954 when the 906th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to the new station from Willow Run AFS, Michigan. Operations began in early 1956, using an AN/TPS-1D radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Budget cuts closed the station in November 1957 and the 906th AC&W; Squadron was inactivated. The station was transitioned into a \\"Gap Filler\\" unmanned site (P-66A), equipped with an AN/FPS-18 radar controlled by Sault Sainte Marie AFS, Michigan until 1968. It was excessed to the GSA and conveyed to Mr. and Mrs. Willard Handrich, who use the site as a residence and the structures for storage purposes. The communications and support equipment was apparently removed prior to the time of sale. Seven structures remained from the original base construction, including the enlisted men's barracks, officer's quarters, radar, power generation, and maintenance buildings and the well house. The well, which is located on the site, supplies the water system for the town of Grand Marais. Superior Wood Products acquired the use of the property rights in 1960 and operated a sawmill and wood products manufacturing concern until 1966, when it went bankrupt and the property returned to Mr. Handrich. He operated a sawmill and wood products manufacturing concern, Grand Marais Industries, from 1966 to 1978. The sawmill utilized the former maintenance and vehicle storage building, to which another structure was added. Today the site is overgrown and abandoned. A few foundations of torn down buildings are visible in aerial imagery, a few others are standing unused and deteriorating.

Life He was eldest son of David Christie, a grand-nephew of Hugh Christie, and was born in Edinburgh. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the University of Edinburgh. Intended for the law, he served an apprenticeship to a writer to the signet, but was never admitted to the Society. His father's death allowed Christie to follow his own wishes and concentrate on art. Giving up his legal prospects, in 1933 he entered as a pupil at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh, then under the direction of Sir William Allan. After studying in London and Paris he returned to Edinburgh and settled there. In 1843, Christie was appointed an assistant, and in 1845, in succession to Thomas Duncan, RSA, first master or director of the ornamental department of the School of Art, under the board of trustees for manufactures in Scotland. In 1848, he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy, where for some years one or more of his pictures appeared in every exhibition. He exhibited only once in the Royal Academy in London, sending in 1853 A Window-seat at Wittemburg, 1526‚ÄîLuther, the married priest. Christie died 5 May 1860. Assessment One of his pictures, An Incident in the History of the Great Plague, went to the National Gallery of Scotland, as did the artist's copy of a large picture painted as an altar-piece for the chapel at Murthley Castle, The Apparition of the Cross to Constantine. Several of the illustrations of the Abbotsford edition of The Bride of Lammermoor are from his designs. Christie delivered courses of lectures at the Philosophical Institution in Edinburgh, and elsewhere, on subjects connected with art. A paper by him On the Adaptation of previous styles of Architecture to our present Wants was in the Transactions of the Architectural Institute of Scotland, vol. iii. (1854).

He devoted much of his life to the study of the caves of Ireland, the product of which were his many contributions to scientific journals in Ireland and the United Kingdom, his founding of the Speleological Society of Ireland and the publishing of his book, The Caves of Ireland. His dedication to the exploration of Irish caves and highly respected articles published both nationally and abroad were pivotal in boosting the study of speleology in Ireland during the mid to late 20th century, earning him the affectionate title of the \\"father of Irish caving\\". Life and caving exploits Coleman was born in Cork, Ireland and worked for Bord F√°ilte from 1945, having trained as a geographer in Cork University. He began caving in 1932, initially exploring caves within cycling distance of his home in Cork City such as Carrigtwohill Caves and Ovens Caves. In 1940 Coleman met Portlaoise textile chemist N. J. Dunnington, who joined him in explorations of caves in South Cork. In July 1941 the pair cycled heavily laden bicycles to County Clare to investigate Pollnagollum, and over the ensuing years undertook a systematic exploration of the cave system. In 1944 the Royal Irish Academy published an article on the cave system by Coleman and Dunnington, which received widespread praise from the scientific community and attracted a new wave of speleologists to the Burren. Coleman was the first speleologist to identify scalloping as an indicator of the direction of water flow in a cave. His findings, made between 1946 and 1949, were published by the University of Bristol Spel√¶ological Society (UBSS). Coleman would later cite the relationship that he built with the society over the following years to be a major stimulus in continuing his work on Irish caves, and ultimately in completing his book on the subject. By the 1960s he had been made Honorary Life Member of the UBSS. Throughout the 1950s Coleman carried out much scientific fieldwork in areas such as Counties Sligo, Monaghan and Kerry, and the Cong region, which would pave the way for further discoveries by local and visiting speleologists. In 1964 Coleman founded the Speleological Society of Ireland, the first representative body for cavers in Ireland. He was also the first editor of the Society's journal Irish Speleology. Coleman published his work widely in a number of publications. His articles included work on Dunmore Cave, Carrigtwohill Caves and Pollnagollum, but it was not until 1965 that his seminal work, The Caves of Ireland, was published. Originally written by Coleman as his MA thesis at Cork University, the book was the first and currently only publication to comprehensively list and describe cave sites throughout Ireland. Coleman was also a prominent member of the Irish Mountaineering Club and was president of the club from 1950‚Äì1953. Coleman was killed in a car accident on 20 April 1971, at the age of 57. He was survived by his wife, son and three daughters.

It is located north-northwest of Two Creeks, Wisconsin. It was closed in 1957. History Two Creeks Air Force Station was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational in December 1954 when the 700th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was moved to the new station from Willow Run AFS, Michigan. Operations began in early 1956, using an AN/TPS-1D medium-range search radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Budget cuts closed the station on 30 November 1957 and the 700th AC&W; Sq was inactivated. After its closure by the Air Force, the United States Army used Two Creeks AFS as a Nike Missile radar installation, operating an AN/FPS-36 search radar (modified AN/TPS-1D), designating the site as Tisch Mills, WI (CM-01R). The Army used the site briefly, then closed it in early 1959. The station was then transitioned into a \\"Gap Filler\\" unmanned site in August 1959 (P-19B), equipped with an AN/FPS-18 radar controlled by Antigo AFS, Wisconsin until June 1968.

Han, hearing of this, made peace with Tianping's acting military governor Zhu Xuan and attacked Heyang again, but was defeated by Zhuge's general Li Hanzhi. After Han's defeat, Le surprised Han by heading for Wei Prefecture in advance of Han and occupying it. The Weibo soldiers supported him to replace Han, who was subsequently killed by his own soldiers. Then-reigning Emperor Xizong thereafter confirmed Le as the acting military governor, and later in the year full military governor.  As military governor  In 884, Emperor Xizong gave Le Xingda a new name of Yanzhen. Emperor Xizong also granted him the honorary title of Zuo Pushe () and the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). It was said that Le Yanzhen was arrogant and unrestrained in his behavior. Once he was firm in his position as military governor of Weibo, he conscripted the people to build an inner city wall in Wei Prefecture and to rebuild the Yellow River levee, requiring both projects to be done within a month and drawing resentment from the people. Further, his son Le Congxun () was said to be violent and greedy. Late in 884, when the former chancellor Wang Duo was set to report to Yichang Circuit (Áæ©Êòå, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) to serve as its military governor, Wang went through Weibo Circuit. Le Congxun, enticed by the large group of women accompanying Wang and the display of wealth, gathered several hundred men and laid an ambush for Wang, killing him and some 300 staff members, seizing Wang's wealth and women. Le Yanzhen reported to the imperial government that Wang had been killed by bandits, and the imperial government, having been recently severely weakened by the rebellion of the agrarian rebel Huang Chao, was unable to investigate further.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. It was said that the people of Weibo had long heard of Wang's good reputation and regretted his death, and thereafter viewed Le Congxun poorly. Still, despite Wang's death, the imperial government thereafter granted the honorary titles of Kaifu Yitong Sansi () and Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies) on Le Yanzhen. In 885, Ma Shuang (), an officer at neighboring Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, then-headquartered in modern Xingtai), rose in rebellion against Zhaoyi's military governor Meng Fangli, trying to force Meng to kill fellow officer Xi Zhongxin (), with whom Ma had a dispute. However, Ma was soon defeated and forced to flee to Weibo. Xi thereafter bribed Le Yanzhen to have Ma killed.  Retirement and death  By 888, the people of Weibo had become disgruntled about Le Yanzhen's rule, and the veteran Weibo soldiers were apprehensive that Le Congxun had gathered a group of several hundred soldiers to serve as his personal guards, calling them \\"the Son's officers\\" (). Le Congxun detected the Weibo soldiers' apprehensions about him, and became so insecure that he fled out of Wei Prefecture. Le Yanzhen thereafter made him the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Handan). Le Congxun thereafter frequently sent messengers to Wei Prefecture to take armors and treasures from Wei to Xiang, drawing further apprehension from the Weibo veterans. Le Yanzhen, fearing that the veterans would mutiny, offered to resign and become a Buddhist monk at Longxing Temple (). (In this disturbance, Lei Ye (), an emissary from Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of neighboring Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who was at Weibo to negotiate a purchase of food supplies from Le Yanzhen, was killed.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. The soldiers thereafter supported the officer Zhao Wenbian (Ë∂ôÊñá„∫π) to serve as acting military governor. Le Congxun, meanwhile, hearing about his father's forced retirement, took some 30,000 soldiers and advanced to Wei Prefecture. Zhao refused to engage Le Congxun. The Weibo soldiers, uncertain of what Zhao's intentions were, killed him and supported another officer, Luo Hongxin. Luo engaged Le Congxun and defeated him, forcing him to retreat to Neihuang (ÂÖßÈªÉ, in modern Anyang). The Weibo forces put Neihuang under siege. Because the Weibo soldiers had killed Lei, Le Congxun decided to seek aid from Zhu. Zhu sent his officer Zhu Zhen () north, capturing three Weibo cities and advancing to Neihuang, where he initially defeated Weibo forces. However, when Le Congxun subsequently tried to fight out of the siege, Luo's officer Cheng Gongxin () attacked and killed him. Subsequently, Le Yanzhen was also executed, and both his head and his son's were publicly displayed on the gate to the Weibo camp. Luo subsequently sent messengers to apologize to Zhu Quanzhong and offer him gifts, so Zhu Quanzhong withdrew his forces, allowing Luo to take over Weibo without further opposition.

On 19 September 2006 it was announced that Bentley would become the managing director of British Gas, part of the Centrica group, taking over from Mark Clare from March 2007. Bentley's stewardship was often controversial, as the company raised residential energy prices several times during his reign; protests at company premises were not unusual. Bentley frequently appeared in the media defending the company's decisions. The controversy was fuelled by the rise in profits during Bentley's stewardship ‚Äì profits from the residential energy division of British Gas increased by 24% in one year alone. Bentley repeatedly claimed that price rises were beyond the company's control, and that they were not increased to raise profits. Throughout his time at the company Bentley's salary (¬£681,000 in 2013) was the subject of frequent criticism. On 27 February 2013, Centrica announced that Bentley would step down from his role at British Gas, from the Centrica board on 30 June 2013, and leave the company's employment on 31 December 2013. Bentley was replaced by the managing director of Direct Energy (also part of the Centrica group) Chris Weston. =Cable and Wireless= On 17 October 2013 it was announced that Bentley would succeed Tony Rice as CEO of Cable & Wireless Communications from 1 January 2014, coinciding with the relocation of the company headquarters from London to Miami, Florida. On 6 January 2014, C&WC; announced that Bentley had purchased 4.3 million shares in the company, at a value of around 3 times his basic salary of ¬£800,000. He demitted office after the acquisition of CWC by Liberty Global on 16 May 2016. =Mitie= In October 2016, it was announced that he would succeed Ruby McGregor-Smith as CEO of Mitie, which he duly did on 13 December 2016. =Other positions= Between 2002 and 2010 he was a non- executive director and chair of the audit committee of Kingfisher plc. On 1 October 2012 Bentley was apportioned non-executive director of global engineering group IMI, and also joined the audit committee and nominations committee.Phil Bentley Kingfisher References Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Bradford Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Oxford Category:INSEAD alumni Category:Centrica people ","title":"Phil Bentley"},{"id":"30520657","text":"Badulla Divisional Secretariat is a Divisional Secretariat of Badulla District, of Uva Province, Sri Lanka.

They have released 10 studio albums, 6 live albums and 3 rarities collections as well as a couple of offshoot project albums in the guise of the Galahad Acoustic Quintet and the Galahad Electric Company. Over the last 32 years they have played with the likes of Pendragon, IQ and Twelfth Night. Galahad have performed their own shows and at festivals in Europe and North America, and have sold tens of thousands of albums despite never having had a major record deal. All releases are on their own 'Avalon Records' imprint other than some re-issues which are released in association with Polish label 'Oskar Productions'. In 2012 and after 27 years of existence Galahad released their first ever LP 'Battle Scars' in conjunction with Ritual Echo Records, on high quality 180 gram vinyl, in a gatefold sleeve, as a limited edition pressing of 300 which is already fast becoming a collectors item. Since then the band has released several more albums on vinyl i.e. 'Beyond the Realms of Euphoria' (a double LP/EP album available on red/orange vinyl), 'Empires never Last' (double LP including an 'orchestral' version of the title track, available on blue or black vinyl), 'Seas of Change' (Standard single LP on black or turquoise blue vinyl and also on limited edition picture disc in a die cut sleeve) and most recently in 2020 'Sleepers' on a double gatefold LP (available on standard black or white vinyl). The band's vocalist Stuart Nicholson described Galahad's early days thus: \\"...the band was formed just after the so called second wave of ‚ÄòProg‚Äô bands such as Marillion, Pallas, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pendragon etc. of Prog bands came to the fore in the early Eighties. They all started around 1978 ‚Äì 1981 and we started in 1985 after the bubble had effectively burst, but didn‚Äôt really get going seriously until 1990 onwards. To be honest we really did play just for fun in the early days and weren‚Äôt really that concerned about record deals etc. It was only after playing with some of the bigger bands when we thought. Actually, we are just as good as these guys so why not give it a go...\\" Interview with Stu Nicholson, by Grande Rock. Founder member Roy Keyworth left the band in March 2017. Producer Karl Groom filled in for Keyworth on the band's Quiet Storms album released in May 2017, but will not join the band full time. Lee Abraham was officially announced as the new Galahad guitarist on 23 October 2017 after having already recorded all the guitar parts for their 2018 Seas of Change album, which was released in January 2018. In 2018 Galahad embarked on putting together what was ostensibly a 21st anniversary edition of 'Following Ghosts. This expansive release brings together all of the ‚ÄòFollowing Ghosts‚Äô related material and consists of a three CD package containing a completely new re-mix of the original ‚ÄòFollowing Ghosts‚Äô album by Karl Groom who used digitised versions of the original 2\\" analogue multi-tracks in order to create the new 2019 mix. CD2, ‚ÄòAlternative Ghosts‚Äô, contains alternative versions of every track from the original album, again engineered and mixed by Karl Groom and featuring Mark Spencer playing bass guitar on a Galahad album for the very first time. Also included is a re-mastered version of the rather experimental ‚ÄòDe-Constructing Ghosts‚Äô album which was originally a separate companion release to the main album in 1999 under the guise of the ‚ÄòGalahad Electric Company‚Äô. This CD contains tracks written and arranged by various other musicians, DJs and re-mixers pieced together from the original Galahad ‚ÄòFollowing Ghosts‚Äô multi-tracks resulting in completely different songs in most cases! In all this expanded release contains a whopping 37 tracks! In many ways this was a comeback album, a fresh start after the difficult trials of the previous ‚ÄòSleepers‚Äô album. An album which seemed to polarise opinion at the time within Prog circles, mainly because of its diverse and, ironically, truly progressive nature. Two decades years later, we think it actually still sounds pretty fresh and perhaps will be assessed in a positive way in today‚Äôs more accepting musical climate as far so called ‚ÄòProgressive Rock‚Äô is concerned. This package includes new artwork, rare photos and notes by various band members and others who were involved at the time. The re-mixed version of the original album will also be released as a double LP on 180gm Gold vinyl in a gatefold sleeve at some point in the near future. 2020 also saw the re- release of 'Sleepers' on vinyl for the first time, 25 years after the original CD release, in conjunctuion with Oskar Records in Poland and including several extra tracks. The album was released as a double gatefold 2xLP on standard black or white vinyl.

The second tower at this location, it remains an active aid to navigation. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. History With the dredging of the harbor in the 1870s and the extension of the piers bracketing it, the need was felt for a light to guide ships into the harbor entrance, as the existing lighthouse high above the water did no more than indicate the location of the town. Accordingly, a short wooden tower was constructed at the end of the north pier, equipped with a fourth-order Fresnel lens. This light supplanted the older lighthouse in 1903, but the keepers of the newer light continued to live in the latter, as no dwelling was provided on the pier. The beacon itself was automated in 1924 but the fog signal continued in manual operation. In 1930 the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Company decided to build a $30 million steam-electric power plant south of the old shipping channel. That plant required a larger harbor to land ships carrying coal. In 1931 funds were provided to improve the harbor under the Works Progress Administration; Construction was protracted and the new breakwaters took three years to complete. As an addendum to this project a new light was constructed, identical to that built at the same time at the Indiana Harbor East Breakwater Light and a design at several other sites in the Great Lakes. This light, constructed of steel plates in an Art Deco style, stood on an open concrete platform which in turn perched at the end of the breakwater forming the northern limit of the harbor. The fourth order lens was retained. As with its predecessor, no provision was made to house the fog signal's keepers, and they continued to live in the old keeper's dwelling in town. Funds for the light were appropriated in 1934 and first light came the following year. Full automation came late to this light. The old lens and its lantern were removed at an undetermined date, but keepers continued to operate the fog signal manually until 1975. The light continues in use, with a second but much shorter tower standing on the southern breakwater to mark the other side of the entrance.

It is located south-southeast of Osceola, Wisconsin. It was closed in 1975. History In late 1950 Air Defense Command selected the East Farmington, Wisconsin site as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. Construction of the station began in 1950 and was opened in June 1951. The 674th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned and began operating a pair of AN/CPS-6B radars from the site. 261 enlisted and 33 officers were assigned, and initially the station functioned as a Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. East Farmington was re-designated as Osceola Air Force Station on 1 December 1953. The radars were retired at the end of the decade as an AN/FPS-7 search radar and two AN/FPS-6A height-finder radars were installed during 1959. During 1959 Osceola AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-10 at Duluth AFS, Minnesota. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 674th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1959, its direction and control duties taken over by DC-10. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to Duluth where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, Osceola was re-designated as NORAD ID Z-35. In addition, the two height-finder radars were modified to AN/FPS-90 sets in 1963. One of the AN/FPS-90 was retired a few years later. In addition to the main facility, Osceola operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Northfield, MN (P-35B) * Jim Falls, WI (P-35C) * La Crescent, MN (P-35F) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In November 1974 the Air Force announced that Osceola would be closing due to what was called \\"redundancies with more strategically located radars\\". The 674th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated in March 1975 as part of a draw-down of ADC, and was closed on 30 April. Today, Osceola Air Force Station is used as an Association Retreat Center. Most of the buildings are in use and well-maintained. The former radar towers are still standing.

It is a dim star but visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.37. The distance to this star can be determined from the annual parallax shift of , yielding a value of roughly 1,100 light years. It is moving closer to the Sun with a heliocentric radial velocity of ‚àí11 km/s. Gray and Garrison (1989) listed a stellar classification of F2 II/III for this star, suggesting it is a K-type star with a spectrum showing mixed traits of a giant/bright giant. Houk and Smith-Moore (1978) had a similar classification of F2/3 II/III. This may indicate it is not a member of NGC 6530, since it shouldn't have evolved to this class from the O-type stars that still populate this cluster, and hasn't had time to evolve from a less massive cluster star. It is a suspected chemically peculiar star. The spectral class from the calcium K line has been given as A8 while the class determined from other metallic lines was F4, making it an Am star.

Under Chaplin's command, the ill-fated charge of the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment against Confederate breastworks during Siege of Petersburg resulted on the greatest single loss of life by a Union Regiment in a single action. A total of 7 officers and 108 men were killed, and another 25 officers and 464 men wounded. These casualties constituted 67% of the strength of the 900-man force. Chaplin survived the action but was subsequently shot by a sharpshooter at Battle of Deep Bottom in 1864, and died four days later in a Philadelphia hospital. Chaplin was born in Red Bank, New Brunswick, Canada, on January 22, 1820. He moved with his family to Bridgton, Maine, when he was about three years of age. There he lived until he was about twenty-one, when he became a clerk for Thurston and Metcalf, ship chandlers, of Bangor, Maine. When the Civil War broke out, he enlisted as a Private in Company F of the Second Maine Infantry Regiment, which was raised in Bangor. He was chosen Captain of the company May 28, 1861, and was promoted to the rank of Major, September 13 of that year. On July 11, 1862, he was appointed Colonel of the Eighteenth Maine Regiment, which became in January 1863 the First Maine Heavy Artillery. Chaplin is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor. In 1867 he was appointed a Brigadier General by Brevet in the Volunteer Army of the United States, for gallant and meritorious services at the Battle of Deep Bottom, Virginia, to date from 17 August 1864. The same General Order appointed him Major General by Brevet, as of the same date. In the HISTORY OF THE FIRST MAINE HEAVY ARTILLERY appears this tribute to him: \\"He was born a soldier, attractive and magnetic in person, a fine horseman with commanding presence. He gave to his officers a royal friendship, to his soldiers a fatherly care, and to all a considerate appreciation of merit, wherever found. He was brave almost to recklessness, but modest withal\\".

The Charleston Terminal Company traced its history back to the East Shore Terminal Company, which was chartered in 1890.Records of the Port Utilities Commission, 1921‚Äì1943, The Charleston Archive, Charleston County Public Library, Kathleen Gray, 2009 The Charleston Terminal Company was created after the East Shore Terminal Company went into foreclosure in July 1903 and its tracks, wharves and waterfront buildings in Charleston were purchased.The Railway Age, Volume 38, 1904, page 538 It was co-owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Southern Railway. The railroads held an agreement with the Charleston Terminal Company in which they would turn over traffic and pay for such services in order to provide the Charleston Terminal Company an additional source of revenue to pay the interest on its bonds and not fall behind financially. Within the next 18 months, the Charleston Terminal Company also acquired waterfront property and terminals that had belonged to the South Carolina Terminal Company. By the early 1900s, the majority of viable dock properties in Charleston, including railway tracks, equipment and wharves, was run by the Charleston Terminal Company. However, more and more railroads were looking to Savannah, Georgia, for shipping and the Charleston waterfront fell into disrepair. The condition of the Charleston wharves became a key issue in the Charleston mayoral race of 1919. Candidate John Grace argued that the franchise of the Charleston Terminal Company should not be renewed and the city should take over the administration of the waterfront. Incumbent Mayor Tristan T. Hyde argued that the franchise should be renewed, but under certain stipulations. Grace went on to win the general election. After his inauguration, Grace immediately began transferring responsibility of the port facilities to the city of Charleston. In March 1920, the South Carolina General Assembly passed an act \\"to authorize cities having a population of fifty thousand inhabitants or more to acquire, purchase, establish, improve, maintain, and operate the port utilities of such cities.\\" A month later, the Charleston City Council denied the Charleston Terminal Company's formal request for a renewal of their franchise. The city of Charleston proceeded to purchase the dock facilities from the Charleston Terminal Company for $1.5 million. In a special election on November 8, 1921, Charlestonians voted in favor of the issuance of $2.5 million in municipal bonds in order to pay for the purchase of the port properties.

Found in Western Australia in 1977 embedded on fragments of humus in sandy soil, it was described as new to science by the Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus in 1978. Taxonomy Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus described the fungus in 1978, from a collection made in August of the previous year in Fitzgerald River National Park, Western Australia. Based on the structure of the hyphae in their spines, Maas Geesteranus considered this species to be most closely related to the widespread Auriscalpium vulgare.

The cap surface is smooth overall, dark brown with tinges of red, and has fine, radially arranged wrinkles. The stipe, which measures long by 3‚Äì5 mm thick, is slightly curved below and becomes slightly wider near the top. The crowded spines on the cap underside are up to 7 mm long. The spores are pip-shaped and covered with tiny spines, amyloid, colourless, and measure 5.8‚Äì6.3 by 3.8‚Äì4.7 ¬µm.

Early career Alata was born on 17 August 1924 in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. His father was of Corsican origin, but he considered himself a \\"white African\\". His wife and mother of his children, T√®nin, was a Malink√©. Alata was a member of the French Communist Party. He served in Senegal for ten years before being dismissed for political reasons and moving to Guinea in 1955. At that time he was in sympathy with the socialist views expressed by Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©, who was to become the first President after Guinea gained independence from France in 1958. He was one of the signatories of an appeal to \\"French Guineans\\" to vote against membership of a French West African union proposed by General Charles de Gaulle. He was appointed Director-General of economic and financial affairs for the Presidency. In the early years of the republic he accepted the authoritarian nature of the regime as necessary during the evolution of a society divided into many ethnic groups towards socialism. Later he fell out of sympathy with Tour√©, leaving office in 1967 but remaining in his adopted country. Imprisonment In November 1970, Portuguese troops invaded Conakry from the sea in a failed attempt to overthrow Tour√©'s government. Following the attempt, many opponents of the regime were thrown into captivity in Camp Boiro and other detention centers. Alata was arrested January 1971 on the grounds that he was an agent of France or the United States, or a member of a neo-Nazi organization from West Germany. On two occasions he was tortured, he was forced to confess his guilt during interrogations, and he was repeatedly abused during his confinement. However, he escaped execution or death by starvation, the fate of many of the prisoners. Later career In July 1975, France agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Guinea after several French prisoners were released from the camp, including Alata. After his release, he wrote a book Prison D'Afrique about his experiences. The book described in detail the brutal tortures and degrading practices that were routine in Camp Boiro. On the orders of the French Minister of the Interior, Michel Poniatowski, the book was banned from publication in France and had to be printed in Belgium. The French authorities did not want to damage the improved relations with Guinea, and did not authorize publication in France until 1982. The book was also banned in Guinea. Alata appeared in the 1978 documentary about the Tour√© regime La danse avec l‚Äôaveugle (If You Dance with a Blind Man), which shattered the myth that Tour√© was a militant hero and exposed the brutality of the regime. The film won several awards. Alata died in September 1978 in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire. Some said that he was poisoned by his wife on the orders of S√©kou Tour√©. Bibliography * *Jean-Paul Alata.

The station opened in 1859 and is located on the Milan‚ÄìBologna railway, Verona‚ÄìModena railway and Modena‚ÄìSassuolo railway. The train services are operated by Trenitalia and Ferrovie Emilia Romagna. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state- owned rail company. Location Modena railway station is situated at Piazza Dante Alighieri, to the north of the city centre. History The station was opened on 21 July 1859, together with the rest of the Piacenza‚ÄìBologna section of the Milan‚ÄìBologna railway. Features =Passenger building= Platform side of the passenger building. The passenger building is not the original structure dating from when the station began operations. That building was demolished and rebuilt in 1920. The present passenger building is rectangular in shape and is made of brick. It is painted yellow, and consists of three parts. The central part is spread over three floors, with access provided through five arches on each side of the building. On the first floor of this part, there are many rectangular mullioned windows decorated with a cornice. The two lateral parts of the building extend symmetrically from the central body. They are on two levels, with seven arches at ground floor level, and many windows (similar to those of the central body) at first floor level. The entrances of all three parts of the building are protected from the weather by a wrought iron canopy, both on the front side and the platform side. =Renovations= Between 2005 and 2006, the station was the subject of extensive renovations commissioned by Centostazioni, with co-financing from RFI. The total expenditure on the renovations was ‚Ç¨700,000. The renovation work included maintenance of the exterior facade of the passenger building, the shelter and pedestrian underpass, upgrading of technological systems, construction of a new basement, the renovation of public conveniences, and renewal of lighting both internally and externally. Also included in the renovation project was the construction of new commercial premises, such as a Chef Express bar and a McDonald's. These two areas alone have about 40 employees, a turnover of ‚Ç¨2.5 million, around 500,000 customers per year, and two rental areas of 360 sqm, offering a total of about 130 seats. =Station yard= The station yard has seven tracks, including five through tracks equipped with platforms: * Track 1 is a loop siding, used for any overtaking of even numbered trains. * Track 2 is one of the main lines, used for even numbered stopping Trenitalia trains. * Track 3 is the other main line, used for odd numbered stopping Trenitalia trains. * Track 4 is a loop siding, used for any overtaking of odd numbered trains. * Track 5 is used by trains terminating in Modena. * Tracks 6 and 7 are used by Ferrovie Emilia Romagna trains operating on the Modena‚ÄìSassuolo line. All tracks have a platform sheltered by a canopy, and connected with the other platforms by the pedestrian underpass. There are other tracks used for storage of the machinery used for line maintenance, and also a repair shop. Train services The station is served by the following service(s): *High speed services (Frecciarossa) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Florence - Rome *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Taranto *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Turin - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Milan - Parma - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Termi - Reggio Calabria *Intercity services Milan - Parma - Bologna - Rimini - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Milan - Parma - Bologna - Rimini - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Taranto *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Milan - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Florence - Rome - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Night train (Intercity Notte) Milan - Parma - Bolgona - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Express services (Regionale Veloce) Piacenza - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Bologna - Rimini - Ancona *Express services (Regionale Veloce) Milan - Piacenza - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Bolgona (- Rimini) *Regional services (Treno regionale) Parma - Reggio Emilia - Modena - Bologna *Local services (Treno regionale) Mantova - Suzzara - Carpi - Modena *Local services (Treno regionale) Sassuolo - Modena Passenger and train movements View of the main platform.

He was one of the nine original popular assemblymen serving in New Amsterdam from 1647 under Pieter Stuyvesant, Governor of New Netherlands. Biography Hendrick Hendricksen Kip was a tailor in Amsterdam in 1624. He came to America about 1637 with his wife and five children, as on the map of New Netherlands of 1639 he is recorded as owning one of the Plantations. In 1647 he was chosen as one of the first Board of \\"Nine Men\\" to act as Governing Tribunal for New Amsterdam. Apparently he was satirically called \\"Hendrick Kip of the haughty lip\\" because he was strong and fearless. He also held office again in 1649 and 1650. He was appointed a Grand Schepen (alderman, or magistrate) on Feb. 2, 1656, and on April 11, 1657 he was admitted to the Rights of a Great Burgher. Thus he took an important part in the government of New Amsterdam. After New Amsterdam was surrendered, he took the Oath of Allegiance to the English in October 1664. His will (found in the Kip Family papers, New York Public Library) apparently was never officially recorded. It was drawn by notary Willem Bogardus. Since both will and accounting cite the notary, it seems likely that Bogardus, who was city treasurer 1680-85 and later postmaster of New York province, entrusted the papers to Hendrick's son Jacob, especially since Jacob, who served five terms as city schepen, aided in administering the estate. His 7800 guilder estate was a substantial one for that time period. Will dated Feb. 2, 1671; Codicil dated Aug. 4, 1680; Estate accounting March 8, 1686. Sons Kip had six children, notably: *Isaac Hendricksen Kip (1627‚Äì1678) **Descendants settled in Rhinebeck, New York. *Jacobus Hendricksen Kip (1631-1690) **Descendants settled in Kip's Bay, Manhattan, and Westchester County, New York *Hendrick Hendricksen Kip, Jr (1633‚Äì1670) **Settled at New Amstel on the Delaware River and then at Midwout, Midwood (Flatbush), Long Island. Legacy * Isaac Hendricksen Kip had a son, Jacobus. In 1685 King James II of England issued a royal grant known today as the Rombout Patent for some of land Francis Rombouts, Stephanus Van Cortlandt (both former mayors of New York City) and Gulian Verplanck purchased from Wappinger Indians on the east bank of the Hudson River in what is today's southern Dutchess County, New York. However, Verplanck died in 1684 and his widow Henrika married Jacobus Kip, and the family's share of the patent passed down through that line.Genealogies of the State of New York: A Record of the Achievements, Volume 2, p. 744 * Hendrick Hendricksen Kip is mentioned in Washington Irving's 1809 satirical history The Knickerbocker's History of New York in the following (ahistorical) anecdote. > [A group of Dutch settlers were sailing down the East River in a small > boat:] \\"While the voyagers were looking around them, on what they conceived > to be a serene and sunny lake, they beheld at a distance a crew of painted > savages busily employed in fishing, who seemed more like the genii of this > romantic region -- their slender canoe lightly balanced like a feather on > the undulating surface of the bay.

Life He was born the son of a farmer and engineer in Hohkirch near G√∂rlitz (present-day Przesieczany in Poland), from where his family moved to Seifersdorf near Dippoldiswalde in Saxony in 1908 and to Chemnitz in 1913. De Kowa joined a cadet corps before he began occupational training as a graphic designer. Having attended drama classes with Erich Ponto, he gave his acting debut at the Staatstheater Dresden in 1922. After appearances in L√ºbeck, Frankfurt and Hamburg, de Kowa entered the stages of the Volksb√ºhne and the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, as well as of the Prussian State Theatre under Gustaf Gr√ºndgens. He had a first small film appearance in Nils Olaf Chrisander's The Heart Thief in 1927 and subsequently became one of the leading comic actors of the UFA film industry. During the Third Reich he joined the Nazi Party, directing the propaganda movie Kopf hoch, Johannes! in 1941. The film idealized the education of the German youth in National Political Institutes of Education, which earned de Kowa an entry on the Gottbegnadeten list to evade his Wehrmacht conscription, though Minister Goebbels was disillusioned with his directing. Despite his involvement into Nazi cinema, de Kowa's film and theatre career quickly proceeded after the war. In 1945 he became director of the Berlin Trib√ºne theatre and an ensemble member of the Vienna Burgtheater from 1956 to 1962. As chairman of the Arts Union, he was also a board director of the Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB). First married to actress Ursula Grabley (1908‚Äì1977) in 1926, de Kowa was remarried in 1941 to Japanese singer and actress Michiko Tanaka (1909‚Äì1988). Both are buried in Friedhof Heerstra√üe, in an Ehrengrab donated by the City of Berlin.

Life Michael Bohnen (left) with Elisabeth Rethberg and Lauritz Melchior en route to New York City, 1932 Michael Bohnen was born in Cologne. He trained in opera singing at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln and with a private tutor, making his debut in 1910 at the Stadttheater D√ºsseldorf. In 1912, he appeared at the Hoftheater Wiesbaden. From 1912 onwards he was a member of the Hofoper Berlin and from 1914 onwards appeared regularly at the Bayreuther Festspiele. He served in the early years of the First World War, but was recalled to the Berliner Hofoper in 1916. In 1925, he played Baron Ochs von Lerchenau in a film of the opera Der Rosenkavalier. After the war, Bohnen joined the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1922, and spent 1933 to 1934 in Buenos Aires. He had an affair with La Jana and entered into a long correspondence with her, now held by his granddaughter. In Germany he also became popular as a spoken-word actor. In 1934, he returned to Berlin, first to the Staatsoper, then from 1935 to 1945 in the Deutschen Oper Berlin and after the end of the Second World War until 1947 as intendant of these halls (where he still sang until 1951) and as president of the Kammer der Kunstschaffenden. His time as intendant at the St√§dtischen Oper Berlin had to come to an end due to an accusation by his pupil, the tenor Hans Beirer, during the denazification process. His rehabilitation during the following years was slow, even though Beirer's accusation was quickly revealed as false. Bohnen thus died in complete poverty, with only a small wage from the city of Berlin. He died in Berlin, where he is buried in the Friedhof Heerstra√üe.

It is known from Ethiopia. The wingspan is 35‚Äì40 mm. Adults are pale brown. The caterpillars are light or dark violet to pinkish white and about 1 to 2 ¬Ω cm. The caterpillars feed in the leaf hearts (leaf funnels) at the vegetative crop stage. The damage is visible as yellowish and dying leaf hearts. Later, larvae bore into the stems. The boring tunnels are seen when you slice the stems. Later, stalk borers also tunnel into grains. The caterpillar feeding kills the growing points of the plant. Caterpillars also carry Fusarium fungi to the cobs, which can produce mycotoxins. If not controlled, stalk borers cause yield loss between 20 - 100% in maize. The larvae feed on various grasses, as well as Zea mays, Sorghum and Saccharum species.  Symptoms  Small holes or 'windows' in straight lines across the newest leaves of maize or sorghum. Eggs are found on the underside of the leaf; they are ~ 1mm creamy white/yellowish in colour which may darken as the develop. As the infestation develops symptoms include: weak stems, damage to growing parts, prevention of flowering and dead hearts. Stalk borers make a hole into the stem and feed inside these stems, which disrupts nutrient and water flow in the plant. The plants become stunted and produce maize cobs that are up to 30% smaller.  Management  = Prevention = Planting early can avoid serious infestation and application of nitrogen (commercial product, manure or compost) can enhance the crop‚Äôs tolerance to an attack. Nitrogen in the soil can also be increased by rotating maize and sorghum with a non-host legume crops e.g. cowpea. This can also prevent pest build-up in the field The Ministry of Agriculture in Zambia, who are partners of the CABi-led programme, Plantwise recommend breaking the stems by ploughing or harrowing after harvest to expose caterpillars to natural enemies and extreme weather which can limit the pest the following season. They also recommend leaving the residues if there are no residues of B. fusca as it improves the soil and prevents water loss. They recommend destroying any alternate hosts e.g. wild sorghum and to not rotate with alternative B. fusca hosts.  Prevention with push and pull crops  Plantwise and partners from Self Help Africa recommend implementing a ‚Äòpush-pull‚Äô system in which Desmodium, a repellent plant, and Napier grass, a trap crop, are intercropped with maize or sorghum can lure the insect away from the crop. Stem borer moths do not like the smell of the fodder legume Desmodium. When it is planted between rows of maize, it pushes away the moths. Desmodium is also a good cover crop to reduce soil erosion. It can be ploughed back into the soil to increase soil health. Desmodium can be planted as an intercrop between maize rows. In contrast, stem borer moths like the napier grass. When it is planted around maize, it serves as a trap crop. The stem borer moths will lay eggs onto Napier grass instead of maize. The eggs hatch into caterpillars that will bore into the grass, which produces sticky glue that traps them. Furthermore, Napier grass produces smells that can attract the stem borer‚Äôs natural enemies. Napier grass is a feed crop for animals, and its root system helps prevent soil erosion. Napier grass can be planted on the border of the plot where maize is to be grown. Both Desmodium and Napier grass can be harvested regularly and used as feed for livestock. = Control = Application of ash or dry soil, by putting one teaspoon of ash or soil into the leaf-funnel of young plants before any symptoms appear is one method that can be used to control B. fusca. Biological control methods have been used to control B. fusca infestation on sorghum. This includes the release of parasitic wasps including Cotesia flavipes or Xanthopimpla stemmator. Chemical control methods can also be used to control B. fusca. Due to variable regulations around (de-)registration of pesticides, specific chemical control methods may differ between countries.

It is documented from 1486 when the building was under construction. It was damaged by an earthquake in the 17th century and was partly rebuilt in the Baroque style. As a result of being constructed in two phases, the church contains both Gothic and Baroque architecture, exemplified in its portals. It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural (a category in the Spanish heritage register) in 1982. Location The church is situated on one side of Plaza Espa√±a, opposite the Municipal Museum. It was situated in this area of the town to avoid being affected by flooding by the Guadalete River. History The original Priory Church in El Puerto de Santa Maria was founded in the 13th century, but the current Church was constructed in the late fifteenth century. The beginning of construction work is referenced in documents dating to 1486, and the church first opened for public worship in 1493. The date of completion is not known, although the beginning of construction work is referenced in documents dating to 1486. Alonso Rodr√≠guez is documented as one of the architects. It was built using sandstone from the Sierra de San Crist√≥bal, a mountain nearby in C√°diz. Sandstone from the same location was also used for pillars in Seville Cathedral. Additions were subsequently made to the structure. The first chapel alongside the nave of the Epistle was built in 1517 by Juan de Lucena. This chapel was bought by Benito Benavides and his wife in 1533, to be used for their burials. In 1636, the church was damaged in an earthquake that affected El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a. =Present day= The church is open for both public worship and for tourists. There is no entrance fee. Architecture =Exterior= The church was built in a Gothic style, although it has baroque and Plateresque elements, as the original structure has been expanded and altered since its construction. The church has doorways from different periods. One of the entrances, known as the \\"Door of Forgiveness\\", is constructed in the Gothic style and dates from the original construction. The doorway currently used as the main entrance is the \\"Sun Portal\\" (Puerto del Sol), which gives access from the Plaza Espa√±a to the nave of the Epistle. The Puerto del Sol was added to the church in the 16th century, probably between 1535 and 1544, and is attributed to Martin Ga√≠nza, an architect who also worked on Seville Cathedral. Its original construction was finances by Don Juan de la Cerda, the Duke of Medina at the time. Additions were made in the 17th century, when rebuilding work was carried out following the earthquake. There is a series of sculptures depicting the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity. The niches between the lower columns contain small sculptures depicting the Church Fathers. =Interior= The church's interior, which displays a number of different styles due to restoration work during its history, has several important architectural features and works of art. This includes two altarpieces, one cast in silver by Jose Medina in 1682, which is currently located in the Chapel of the Shrine, and another in the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles, which was created in the 16th century by a member of the Pedro Duque y Cornejo school.

The green areas on the right are, from north to south, Elk Island National Park, the Blackfoot Recreation Area, and Miquelon Lake Provincial Park (north and south blocks). The Beaver Hills (), also known as the Beaver Hills Moraine and the Cooking Lake Moraine, are a rolling upland region in Central Alberta, just to the east of Edmonton, the provincial capital. It consists of of \\"knob and kettle\\" terrain, containing many glacial moraines and depressions filled with small lakes. The major lakes were connected til Camrose reverse drained their headwaters, Miquelon. The landform lies partly within five different counties, Strathcona, Leduc, Beaver, Lamont and Camrose. The area is relatively undeveloped compared to the surrounding region, and is protected by in part by Elk Island National Park, the Cooking Lake‚ÄìBlackfoot Provincial Recreation Area, the Ministik Bird Sanctuary, Miquelon Lake Provincial Park and a number of smaller provincial natural areas. Natural history Hastings Lake from the south The \\"hills\\" are very low and not very prominent, as the region is actually just a slight rise above the surrounding region which also happens to be rough and rolling due to a different history during the end of the last ice age. Being at a slightly higher elevation, the bedrock in what would become the hills only briefly covered by glacial Lake Edmonton, which deposited a thick layer of silt on the rest of the region, the basis of the modern agricultural soils now found in the areas around the hills, but left mostly gravel and boulder-sized debris on the hills, along with much water in the depressions left behind by ice and stone during the preceding glacial era.Macdonald, pp. 9-12 The vegetation is typically of part of the dry mixedwood boreal forest natural subregion, a transitional zone on the south edge of the boreal forest, but is surrounded by aspen parkland. This island of boreal forest in the south means that both boreal animal species (moose, black bear, Canada lynx) and grassland animal species (sharp-tailed grouse, mule deer) live in the region. Nearby landscapes include Beaverhill Lake just to the east, and the North Saskatchewan River to the north. Human history  = Indigenous peoples and fur trade history = As a well wooded and watered area near to more open grasslands, the Beaver Hills were an important camping place for nomadic peoples making a seasonal migration between the plains and the hills. It was a place that Indigenous people \\"could replenish and recoup after spending extended periods on the plains, a place where they could hunt, fish, and gather other needed resources\\".http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/canadian_historical_review/summary/v092/92.2.fortna.html Because the hills were not ploughed under, unlike the rest of region, much archaeological evidence remains here, including 227 Native sites recorded by Parks Canada in Elk Island Park alone. The Sarcee are the first ethnic group known to have inhabited the region in the period after European contact (and thus the beginning of a written historical record). Sometime before 1800 Cree people migrating from the east displaced the Sacree from the hills onto the plains. The Cree called the region Amiskwaciy, which literally means \\"beaver hills\\" and is the origin of the region's later names in French, and then English. The Cree pursued an economy based around trapping and trading with Euro-Canadian fur companies as well as the more traditional forms of hunting gathering, and fishing. The Cree also adopted buffalo hunting techniques from plains peoples to the south, including the use of buffalo pounds. The beaver and other game species in the area eventually became trapped out, and they largely abandoned the area as a permanent home, though continued to travel through the area. Two major Indigenous and fur trade trails border the hills, the Victoria Trail to the north and the Battle River Trail to the south. The Beaver Hills are mentioned in Euro-Canadian records as early as Peter Fidler's sketches of 1793. David Thompson's map of 1814 mentions the hills prominently as place of refuge for both the Sarcee and Cree. They are also reported on by the Palliser Expedition of the 1850s and by Joseph B. Tyrell of the Geological Survey of Canada in the 1880s.MacDonald, pp. 1-9 Initial reserve development This is one of oldest protected areas in Canada, having originally been a forest reserve set aside by the federal Department of the Interior in 1892, during the homesteading era. It was formalized as the Cooking Lake Forest Reserve in 1899, the first such reserve in Canada. A part of the reserve was given further protection in 1906 as Elk Park, later to become Elk Island National Park. In 1930, Crown lands in Alberta passed from the federal government to the provincial government, Elk Park became formalized as a national park while the rest of the Cooking Lake Forest Reserve became a provincial responsibility. Later development In 2002 the Beaver Hills Initiative was created to coordinate land-use planning in the municipalities in the area surrounding the protected parks. This resulted in a scheme of tradable development credits. In 2006 the area became recognized as a dark sky preserve by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. In 2016 it was named a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

It was established in 1977 under the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974, having previously been a forest reserve. It is the most fertile of the three, non- adjoining wildlife sanctuaries established in the Sundarbans at that time, the others being the Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary and the Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary. The dominant mangrove species is \\"sundri\\" (Heritiera fomes) from which the Sundarbans region gets its name. Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary is in the lower right portion of the dark area on the right of this satellite image of the Sundarbans Geography The Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary is in a low-lying area of flat islands interspersed by a network of waterways. It is situated between the Katka and Supati Kals creeks in the Ganges Delta and is bounded to the south by the Bay of Bengal. The Baleshwari River supplies some freshwater but otherwise the waters are saline, being constantly replenished by the rise and fall of the tide. Sands collect near the mouth of the creeks and is blown into dunes and in their lee, silt accumulates. The altitude of the sanctuary varies between above sea level. The soil is more fertile than that of Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary and Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary because a larger quantity of sediment is deposited here by the River Ganges. As the land is raised by accumulating silt, it gets inundated by the tide less often. The soil pH is mostly between 7.0 and 8.0. Up to of rainfall falls at the coast with most precipitation being during the monsoon, which lasts from June to October. The driest months are December, January and February. In the winter the temperature may fall as low as but rises to a maximum of about in April and May. The mean annual temperature is about . The average relative humidity is high, ranging between 77 and 80%, and peaking during the monsoon at 95%. There are four main types of habitat in the sanctuary; mangrove woodlands, grasslands, sandy beaches and areas of transition. Flora Typical mangrove forest scene in the Sundarbans Mangroves in this delta region are not dominated by members of the Rhizophoraceae family, probably because of the low salinity caused by the inflow of river water. The commonest species are \\"sundri\\" (Heritiera fomes), interspersed with \\"gewa\\" (Excoecaria agallocha) and \\"passur\\" (Xylocarpus mekongensis), with \\"kankra\\" (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) occurring in areas subject to more frequent flooding. There is an understory of \\"shingra\\" (Cynometra ramiflora) where, soils are drier, \\"amur\\" (Aglaia cucullata) in wetter areas and goran (Ceriops decandra) where the salinity is higher. Nypa palm (Nypa fruticans) is widespread along drainage channels. The most abundant plants on the forest floor were the mangrove date palm (Phoenix paludosa), holly-leaved acanthus (Acanthus ilicifolius), Sarcolobus globosus and Derris trifoliata. Fauna Spotted deer in the Sundarbans There are more than forty species of mammal present in this and the adjoining Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary and Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary. The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is plentiful and is the only primate in the area. Bengal tigers are also present; they have a reputation as being man-eaters, but their chief prey is the spotted deer (Axis axis) and the wild boar (Sus scrofa). There are three species of wild cat, the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), the fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) and the jungle cat (Felis chaus). Also present are three species of otter, one of which, the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), has been domesticated by local fishermen. The South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) inhabits some of the larger water channels. Birds are plentiful with over 270 having been recorded in the area including 38 species of raptor, 95 species of waterfowl and 9 of kingfisher. On the coast there are gulls and terns, on the mudbanks waders are plentiful and various forest birds are found among the trees. Some of the birds recorded such as the masked finfoot (Heliopais personatus) and the white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) are threatened globally. The greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga) overwinters here but the lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus) is a resident but uncommon species as is the mangrove pitta (Pitta megarhyncha) and the black-headed ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus). The streak-breasted woodpecker (Picus viridanus) is at the western end of its range here. Other notable birds include the great stone-curlew (Esacus recurvirostris) and the buffy fish owl (Bubo ketupu). 45 species of reptile have been recorded, but the mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), has been overhunted and is no longer present, and the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is much reduced in numbers. There are 11 species of amphibian and more than 120 species of fish. Crustaceans are abundant, especially fiddler crabs and mud crabs, as well as lobsters, shrimps and prawns. Management The reserve is managed from administrative offices at Katka and Tiger Point. Certain activities are prohibited in the reserve; settlement, the cultivation of land, keeping livestock, damaging the vegetation, hunting and lighting fires. Management is directed at conservation of the tigers and other wildlife as a part of forest management. In the long-term, as sediment is deposited, the main channels in the Ganges Delta are migrating eastwards. As other channels silt up, the reserve is becoming more saline and a gradual replacement of Heritiera fomes by Excoecaria agallocha may occur. Oil spills, such as happened in December 2014, are a threat to the aquatic life and the forest itself. Tropical cyclones and tsunamis can cause great damage to this low- lying area, and wood-cutting and unauthorised hunting and fishing take place. The landfall of Cyclone Sidr in 2007 damaged around 40% of the area.

It is formed at the unified delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. The total area of the entire Sundarbans is about one million ha, 60% of which is found in Bangladesh, with the remainder in India. The region is divided by the Raimangal River. Within the Bangladeshi area of Sundarbans, there are three wildlife sanctuaries: Sundarbans East, Sundarbans South, and Sundarbans West. Environment The region is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mud flats and small islands of salt tolerant mangrove forests. The area is flooded with brackish water during high tides which mix with freshwater from inland rivers. Flora The region supports several mangroves, including: sparse stands of gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) and dense stands of goran (Ceriops tagal), with discontinuous patches of hantal palm (Phoenix paludosa) on drier ground, river banks and levees. Fauna The fauna of the sanctuary is very diverse with some 40 species of mammals, 260 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles. The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans.

They formed in 1976 under the name ICE but changed it to Black Rose in 1980 and were one of many British bands considered part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. The original line-up was Steve Bardsley (lead vocals/guitar), Kenny Nicholson (guitar), Marty Rajn (bass) and Mark Eason (drums). Over the next nine years the band went through various line-up changes and released quite a few records including two albums: Boys Will Be Boys (1984) and Walk It How You Talk It (1986) before splitting up in 1989. The band then re-formed in 2006 and released their newest album Cure for Your Disease in 2010.  History  Black Rose started out as ICE back in 1978 when three friends from a School in Saltburn by the Sea decided to form a rock band. The three guys were Steve Bardsley, Marty Rajn and Mark Eason who soon became a four piece after they saw guitarist Kenny Nicholson playing in a local pub and asked him if he wanted to join up with them. Eason left the band citing musical differences and local drummer Charlie Mack was drafted in. As this line-up they recorded their first demo tape at Impulse Studios in Wallsend Newcastle, the home of independent record label Neat Records, which consisted of five songs: \\"Alright On The Night\\", \\"Biker\\", \\"Killer\\", \\"Loveshock\\" and \\"Raising Hell\\". The demo was picked up by various rock disco playlists, and featured in the local charts section of the British rock magazine Kerrang!. Nicholson and Mack both left the band to pursue others ventures, Mack joined Emerson and then ended up in Samson and Nicholson went on to form both Holland and Fast Kutz. New guitarist Chris \\"wahwah\\" Watson and drummer Mal Smith then joined the band and they released their first single on the Teesbeat label called \\"No Point Runnin'\\". Rajn fell out with the rest of the band over various issues and departed, making way for another bass player Mick Thompson to step in. This went on to be probably the most stable line-up of the band, recording and releasing an array of songs including their d√©but album Boys Will Be Boys and featuring on a variety of compilation records. The band toured all over the UK and Europe playing alongside established bands including Raven, Terraplane, Budgie, Trust, Vardis, Atomic Rooster, Pretty Maids and Spider, and gathered a worldwide fanbase having fan clubs in Europe, Japan and the United States. By the mid 1980s, they were also joined by guitar and keyboard player Gary Todd and major record labels Atlantic Records and Bronze Records both showed some interest in the band but neither signed them up to any deal so Watson got a bit disillusioned and left, making way for the guitarist Pat O'Neil. This line-up recorded the band's second album Walk It How You Talk It released by Neat Records which saw them recording slightly more melodic songs. This album was also picked up by AJK, a subsidiary of K-tel in the United States where it was repackaged and ready to be released independently, but because of a dispute over copyrights with a US band of the same name the record was not issued. This was to be the beginning of the end for the band and although they recorded some more material nothing was released and they split up in 1989. In 2006 Bardsley, after speaking to Watson, decided to write some new material together and Black Rose were born again. British indie rock label Majestic Rock Records released a CD of the band's songs from 1980-89 called Bright Lights Burnin' and, in 2010, the band released their third album Cure for Your Disease as an independent download- only release. A new line-up was put together and the band played their first gig in 25 years at the Cradle Will Rock festival in Shildon, County Durham. In 2012, they were invited to play at Hammerfest lV and also at the Headbangers Open Air festival in Germany. The band also released three new albums on German record labels.

Early years Constan√ßa Capdeville was born in Barcelona and lived in the village of Caxias as a child. She came from an artistic family and in her youth was exposed to creative geniuses including Salvador Dal√≠. She wrote piano compositions at an early age, and studied piano and composition at the Lisbon Conservatorio Nacional, where she received a diploma in Higher Education in Music. After completing her studies in Barcelona, Capdeville settled in Portugal in 1951. She pursued further studies in piano with Varela Cid and musical composition with Jorge Croner de Vasconcellos. She then specialized her education in music to the study of ancient music (paleography/transcribing, organology, clavichord and performance practice) with Mac√°rio Santiago Kastner. Biography After completing her musical studies, Capdeville taught music at the National Conservatory and the New University of Lisbon. She was a member of the Portuguese Council of Music and the Catalan Composers Association of Barcelona. She won the Portuguese Medal of Cultural Merit in 1990, and the Insignia of the Order of Santiago da Espada posthumously in 1992. Capdeville was a prolific composer. By 1969 she had begun to have her works commissioned by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation for its orchestra. She produced approximately 100 pieces for orchestra, chamber ensembles and a variety of soloists using different instruments. She also composed music for films and plays, ballet/dance and 'dramatized' staged performances. From early on, her music revealed close ties to the dramatic arts and to the imagery of the human condition evoked though sound and Mise en sc√®ne. Capdeville's compositions were laden with multiple artistic perception. During her life, she was a close artistic and personal friend of music genius Jorge Peixinho who had himself been a towering influence upon the contemporary Portugal of the latter half of the 20th century. Capdeville was also a talented percussionist, but as a musician her main instrument was the piano. Besides the conservatory, she taught at the Escola Superior de M√∫sica de Lisboa and at the Academia de Musica de Santa Cecilia in Lisbon. She also taught in the Musicology department of the 'Universidade Nova de Lisboa' (New University of Lisbon) 's Faculty of Humanities ( UNL- FCSH ). In this position, she taught a number of students who went on to prominence in music and composition and went on to receive prestigious national and international awards. These students include Eurico Carrapatoso, among others. Capdeville died of cancer February 4, 1992, at the age of 55 in her hometown of Caxias. Works Capdeville composed about a hundred works, including orchestral music, theater works and film soundtracks. Selected works include: *Diferen√ßas Sobre o Intervalo' (1967) for orchestra *Libera me (1979) for ensemble (choir, piano, percussion, tape and lights) *Cerro Maior (dir.

In 1633 the Spanish had invaded Saint-Martin (Sint Maarten) and Anguilla, driving off the French and Dutch inhabitants. The French and Dutch banded together to repel the Spanish and it was during a 1644 sea battle that the Dutch commander Peter Stuyvesant, later the governor of New Amsterdam, unsuccessfully besieged Fort Amsterdam and was forced to retreat with the loss of hundreds of men. A stray Spanish cannonball shattered his leg, which had to be amputated.Caribbean: The Lesser Antilles Karl Luntta But luck was on the Dutch side, and when the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands ended, the Spanish no longer needed a Caribbean base and just sailed away in 1648.Paris Permenter, John Bigley p.63 Background The Spanish, who had been content with their lucrative holdings in the Greater Antilles, began to notice the successful French, English, and Dutch settlements springing up in the Lesser Antilles. Remembering their Pope-given rights, thousands of Spanish troops stormed St.Martin in 1638, took control of the island and built the Old Spanish Fort at Point Blanche.Sullivan p.21 Six years later, Peter Stuyvesant (later the governor of Nieue Amsterdam) directed his Dutch troops in an unsuccessful effort to retake the island.Sullivan p.21 Attack Governor Pieter Stuyvesant of Cura√ßao sent five large Dutch ships, a pink, and two tenders on a campaign to reconquer the former WIC base of Sint Maarten. After pausing at Saint Kitts to recruit English and French volunteers, he arrived off the eastern shores of Sint Maarten at dawn on 20 March, accompanied by a half-dozen merchantmen that continued further north; Stuyvesant's squadron veered inshore and besieged the lone Spanish fortification, then anchored nearby and disembarked several hundred troops.Marley p.130 The Dutch spent the next two days installing a three-gun battery atop some heights; on 22 March they called on Spanish Governor Diego Guajardo Fajardo to lay down his arms. Despite low morale, poor equipment, and insufficient rations, the 120-man Spanish garrison refused to surrender, and Stuyvesant initiated a long-range bombardment next dawn. A chance Spanish countershot carried off the Dutch commander‚Äôs right leg while he was standing beside his battery, requiring Stuyvesant to be carried back aboard ship for amputation below the knee. The injury left the small army leaderless, undermining its resolve.Marley p.130 On the night of 31 March‚Äì1 April an assault column under cover of darkness advanced toward the Spanish positions, almost escaping the sentinels‚Äô detection because all were musketeers (and hence carry no lit cords). Once the Dutch intruders were discovered, however, a firefight erupted until dawn; at least five Dutch attackers were killed, as opposed to a single Spaniard. A second, even more half-hearted attempt was made at 9pm on 3 April, which was easily repelled; no further assaults were made.Marley p.130 On the night of 15‚Äì16 April, a Puerto Rican coaster under Sargento Mayor Baltasar de Alfaro landed refreshments for Guajardo's garrison, snapping the besiegers‚Äô will. The Dutch retired to their ships; a rearguard blew up the siege guns and fires the encampments by 17 April, and the flotilla departed toward Sint Eustatius and then Cura√ßao. Stuyvesant eventually returned toward Holland in August to convalesce from his wound.Marley p.130 Aftermath The year the Spanish left, the French and Dutch returned and divided the island ‚Äì to the Dutch and to the French. For the next two centuries there were occasional clashes between the two nations for complete control of the island, but in 1869 a final agreement was reached honoring the original boundaries set in 1648. The two-nation island has existed peacefully ever since.Leonard Adkins St. Martin & St. Barts: A Walking & Hiking Guide  Notes   References  *Paris Permenter,John Bigley Adventure Guide to Anguilla, Antigua, St. Barts, St. Kitts, St. Martin: Including Sint Maarten, Barbuda & Nevis (Adventure Guide to Anguilla, Antigua, St Barts, St Kitts & St Martin) *Lynne M.

Life  He was born in Constantinople in 1854, studied at the Greek Army Academy and graduated in 1877 as an Artillery Ensign. He was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant on 28 September 1879, to Lieutenant in 1882 and to Captain in 1886. In the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, he commanded a battery. After the war he was promoted to Major (1898), Lieutenant Colonel (1906) and Colonel (1910). During this time he served for a time as head of the Artillery School, Chief of the Athens Gendarmerie, Athens garrison commander, and commander of an artillery regiment. Promoted to Major General in 1912, during the First Balkan War he commanded the 4th Infantry Division, which played a crucial role in the Greek victory at the Battle of Sarantaporo by flanking the Turkish positions, as well as at the Battle of Yenidje. After the capitulation of the VIII Ottoman Provisional Corps at Thessaloniki, Moschopoulos and his division were transferred to the Army of Epirus. On 4‚Äì6 January he substituted for Lt Gen Konstantinos Sapountzakis as commander of the Army of Epirus. During the second Greek assault against the Ioannina fortified zone on 7 January 1913, Moschopoulos commanded the right (eastern) flank, comprising the 4th Division and the Epirus Division. During the final Greek offensive, Moschopoulos commanded the Second Army Detachment on the army's left (western) flank, which executed the main attack against the forts around Ioannina. During the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, Moschopoulos continued to lead the 4th Division, fighting in the Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas. During the final phases of the war he commanded the Moschopoulos Army Detachment (Œ§ŒºŒÆŒºŒ± Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ¨œÇ ŒúŒøœÉœáŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒøœÖ), grouping the 4th and 2nd Divisions. The future general and academic, Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian, who served briefly under him in the 4th Field Battery during the lead-up to the 1897 war, describes him as \\"not distinguished in education or industriousness\\", but a successful commander during the Balkan Wars because he \\"was willing to listen to other opinions, was optimistic, and took risks\\". After the war, he was promoted to Lieutenant General and given command of the newly established III Army Corps at Thessaloniki. From 13 August to 11 November 1916, he served as Chief of the Army Staff Service, and in 1917, he was appointed as Military Governor of Epirus and Corfu. He retired on 25 April 1920. In 1922, he served as Governor-General of Thessaloniki. He died in 1942.

The three-year project was launched in 2009. The research and development was carried out by several European auto manufactures with Volvo at the lead. A first practical test successfully took place in December 2010. In September Volvo announced that the SARTRE research project had come to a close, and that the company was ready to look into putting its finished product on the road. Project aims The aim of the project is to develop prototype systems to aid the development of platooning for eventual use on unmodified public motorways, interacting with non- platooned traffic. The project was formally launched in September 2009, with an intended duration of three years. The EU hopes the use of platooning on European roads would cut fuel consumption, journey times, and congestion. Proposed system The SARTRE platooning system envisages a platoon of up to eight vehicles linked electronically, with the lead vehicle controlled by a professional driver, controlling in turn those following, as slave vehicles. Aimed at commuters in cars, but also possibly commercial vehicles and buses, drivers would be able to join and leave the platoon at will. To keep costs down, the technology for the system is to be achieved through off the shelf components, and specifically without requiring costly changes to highway infrastructure. Funding and participants The SARTRE project is run as a consortium, funded by the European Commission under their Seventh Framework Programme. The consortium is led by the British company Ricardo UK. Other participating organisations are: * Applus IDIADA (Spain) * Institut f√ºr Kraftfahrwesen Aachen (IKA) (Germany) * Robotiker-Tecnalia (Spain) * SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden * Volvo Car Corporation (Sweden) * Volvo Technology (Sweden) Trials Test track trials of SARTRE platooning took place at the Volvo Proving Ground near Gothenburg, Sweden and in a public road in Spain. In January 2011 the first successful trial took place at Volvo's test track in Sweden, in which a single car followed behind a rigid truck. With control being taken by the truck, the driver of the slaved car was able to take his hands off the wheel, read a newspaper, and sip coffee. In January 2012 SARTRE carried out a second demonstration in a public road in Barcelona, Spain, this time with of a multiple vehicle platoon, a lead truck followed by three cars driven entirely autonomously at speeds of up to with a gap between the vehicles of no more than .

CoBank ACB, 531 U.S. 316 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned whether CoBank is exempt from state income tax requirements. A unanimous Court held that they are not exempt. Background The Farm Credit Act of 1933 created various lending institutions, including banks for cooperatives, which are designated as federally chartered instrumentalities of the United States. CoBank ACB is the successor to all rights and obligations of the National Bank for Cooperatives. In 1996, CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of that bank, requesting an exemption from all Missouri corporate income taxes and refunds on the taxes it paid for 1991 through 1994. CoBank asserted that the Supremacy Clause accords federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity, which the Act did not expressly do. The state of Missouri denied the request, but the Missouri State Supreme Court reversed, stating that because the Act's current version is silent as to the banks' tax immunity, Congress cannot be said to have expressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, the banks are exempt. Opinion of the Court Thomas penned the CoBank decision Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the decision of the Court, which unanimously reversed the Missouri Supreme Court. The Court held that banks for cooperatives are subject to taxation. Thomas wrote for the Court that nothing in the 1985 amendments to the Farm Credit Act indicated a repeal of the previous express approval of state taxation and that the structure of the Act indicated by negative implication that banks for cooperatives were not entitled to immunity. The Court rejected further claims by CoBank that they were entitled to immunity under McCulloch v. Maryland, stating that that doctrine was expressly not invoked by Congress in this instance. There was also discussion of the specific wording of the statute. Thomas wrote, \\"Had Congress simply deleted the final sentence of ¬ß2134 that limited the exemption while retaining the sentence granting the exemption, we would have no trouble concluding that Congress had eliminated the States‚Äô ability to tax banks for cooperatives. Short of this act, however, we find Congress‚Äô silence insufficient to disrupt the 50-year history of state taxation of banks for cooperatives.\\" With this decision, the Missouri Supreme Court had erred in finding an exemption, and the case was remanded to them to alter their previous determination.

Finn Sejersted (3 August 1868 ‚Äì 22 January 1914) was a Norwegian director and railway engineer. He was born in Trondheim, Nord- Tr√∏ndelag in 1868, and studied at Trondhjems tekniske Skole (\\"Trondheim School of Technology\\") between 1887 and 1890. After he finished studying, he was hired by the Norwegian State Railways, where he worked as an installation director of the Sol√∏r, S√¶tesdal and Gj√∏vik Lines. In 1897, Sejersted became managing director of Holmenkolbanen, at an age of 29 years.
