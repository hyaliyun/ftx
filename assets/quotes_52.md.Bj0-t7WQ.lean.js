Description Females have a body length of 8‚Äì9 mm, males 5-6.5mm. C. erraticum is a distinctively marked spider which shows a wide dark red stripe running down the centre of the abdomen, which is in turn surrounded by an area of creamy-yellow while the head is a reddish brown. Distribution The species has a Palearctic distribution, from Ireland to east Asia. Habitat This species favours the herbaceous layer and low bush layer of open habitats, such as rough heather. In Britain the altitudinal range is from sea level to 700 m. Biology In early summer C. erraticum builds a retreat made from two or three leaves or grass heads which are stitched together to hold the female and her egg sac. Later in the year, the immature spiders, which are already showing the reddish median stripe on the abdomen, can be found in small silk cells on plant stems. Adult males are encountered mostly in late spring and early summer while the adult females are mostly found from late spring to the autumn. The spider wasp Homonotus sanguinolentus is a rare species which is wholly dependent on Cheiracanthium spiders and in Britain is wholly dependent on C. erraticum. The ichneumonid wasp Schizopyga podagrica is another parasitoid of C. erraticum.

Balla, an amateur astronomer, observed the transit through a telescope likely outfitted with a smoked glass filter. His composition, according to daughter Elica Balla, depicts two intersecting views of the event, through the telescope and with the naked eye. Green and white triangles in the painting represent glare and other optical effects observed by Balla. In several versions of the painting, overlapping spirals, suggestive of the telescope body, emanate from the golden-orange orb of the magnified and filtered Sun; these encounter the brilliant white star in the upper left‚Äîthe Sun as seen with the naked eye. The painting represents Balla's subjective experience of the event. It exemplifies his transition to a more abstract style, as well as his interest in themes of cosmogony; he uses the opacity of gouache to suggest a dense fusion of cosmic forces. During this period, Balla had begun to experiment with the use of geometric and curving forms and transparent planes to convey movement. Mercury Passing Before the Sun translates the temporal progression of Mercury's transition into a spatial progression, using methods devised by the Cubists. Versions Balla created at least a dozen versions and studies of the painting; the version in tempera, now in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, is considered by that gallery to be the \\"definitive outcome\\" of these studies. Other versions include: *A version in tempera on canvas, located at the mumok in Vienna *A version in oil on canvas, located at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, in Paris *A version in watercolor and graphite on woven paper adhered to canvas, in the Philadelphia Museum of Art *An study in gouache on paper, sold at auction in 2015 for US$1.69 million to the A.

Until 1392 the church underwent changes and additions, which also led to a change of style: the western facade is clearly Gothic. After an earthquake in 1460, the facade was redesigned in 1488, with the addition of Renaissance elements. The tower, which offers views of the city and the bay, is four stories, follows the style of an Italian bell tower and houses one of the oldest bells in Slovenia, dating back to 1333. Early 18th century, Koper was under Venetian influence, and was again an architectural transformation in the Baroque style. Under the direction of Giorgio Massari, additional landscaping elements were added to the church, including valuable paintings of Venetian painters Pietro Liberi, Celesti Andrea, Antonio Zanchi and Vittore Carpaccio.

A specialist sprinter with a preference for soft ground, she showed very good form as a two-year-old in 2015 when she won three of her four races including the Harry Rosebery Stakes and the Cornwallis Stakes. In the following year she established herself as one of the best sprinters in Europe with wins in the Prix Sigy, Sandy Lane Stakes, Commonwealth Cup and Haydock Sprint Cup. All of her victories have come against male opposition. In November 2016 became the first three-year-old filly to be named Cartier Champion Sprinter. She was retired after the 2017 British Champions Sprint. Background Quiet Reflection is a bay mare with a white blaze and a white sock on her right hind leg. She was bred by the Springcombe Park Stud, a stud farm on the borders of Somerset and Wiltshire which was founded by Paul Gardner in 2007 on the site of an old dairy farm. Gardner later admitted that his decision to sell Quiet Reflection was \\"probably a big mistake\\". As a yearling the filly was auctioned at the Goffs Doncaster Silver Sale on 28 August 2014 and was bought for ¬£32,000 by Geoffrey Howson Bloodstock. In April 2015 the filly was entered in a \\"breeze up\\" sale (in which the horses are publicly galloped before being sold) at Doncaster and was bought for ¬£44,000 by the trainer Karl Burke. Burke sold a half share to the Ontoawinner syndicate and a 35% share to Hubert Strecker, retaining a 15% share for himself. The filly went into training with Burke at Middleham in North Yorkshire. Quiet Reflection has suffered from fragile hooves and has received regular treatment from the specialist farrier Andy Grant. Quiet Reflection was from the second crop of foals sired by Showcasing, a stallion who won two of his seven races including the 2009 edition of the Gimcrack Stakes. He made a very promising start to his stud career, also siring Toocoolforschool (Mill Reef Stakes), Prize Exhibit (San Clemente Handicap), Tasleet (Greenham Stakes) and Cappella Sansevero (Round Tower Stakes). Quiet Reflection's dam My Delirium recorded her only success in eight races when she won a maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse in October 2010 at odds of 80/1. She was descended from the American broodmare Annie Aaron, a half-sister to Alysheba. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= On 16 July 2015 Quiet Reflection began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Hamilton Park Racecourse in which she started 2/1 second favourite in a six-runner field of colts and fillies. Ridden by the apprentice jockey Joey Haynes she went to the front approaching the final furlong and accelerated clear to win by five lengths. The Racing Post described the performance (achieved on good to soft ground) as \\"promising\\". The filly was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse on 20 August when she was again partnered by Haynes. After tracking the leaders she could make no impression in the last quarter mile and finished fifth behind the William Haggas-trained Betharah. Graham Lee took over from Haynes when Quiet the filly was sent to Scotland for the Listed Harry Rosebery Stakes at Ayr Racecourse on 18 September. Easton Angel, who had finished third in the Lowther Stakes was made the odds-on favourite with Quiet Reflection the 8/1 second choice in a sixteen-runner field. Field of Vision set the pace before Quiet Reflection took the lead inside the final furlong and quickly drew away to win by four lengths. Karl Burke commented \\"She's a good filly. She was knocked over after 100 yards which not many people picked up on in the Lowther... Unfortunately I took her out of the Cheveley Park after the Lowther and I wouldn't have minded having a crack at that after today.\\" In the Cornwallis Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 9 October the filly started 5/6 favourite, with Field of Vision being the best-fancied of her ten opponents. After looking outpaced in the early stages she was sent into the lead by Lee a furlong out and went clear to beat Field of Vision \\"readily\\" by two and a half lengths. =2016: three-year- old season= Spring The former National Hunt jockey Dougie Costello took over as Quiet Reflection's regular jockey in 2016. She began her second season with a trip to France for the Group Three Prix Sigy over 1200 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 10 April and started the 7/2 second favourite behind the Jean-Claude Rouget-trained Saryshagann. Racing on heavy ground she took a clear advantage 200 metres from the finish but was hard-pressed in the closing strides before winning by a head from Jimmy Two Times. Burke commented \\"We have learned something there because she probably hit the front too soon. I thought we had it won easily and then when the camera angle changed and there was another 200 metres to run, I slightly had my heart in my mouth\\". On her next start the filly returned to Group Two class for the first time since the Lowther when she ran in the Sandy Lane Stakes on 28 May at Haydock Park. Gifted Master (Pavilion Stakes) started favourite ahead of Buratino (Coventry Stakes) and La Rioja (Dick Poole Stakes) with Quiet Reflection on 7/1 alongside Donjuan Triumphant (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte). After being restrained by Costello in the early stages she took the lead a furlong out and drew clear in \\"impressive\\" style to win by three and three quarter lengths. Costello said that the filly won in a \\"hack canter\\", whilst Burke commented \\"She's a different filly to the one that won in France [in April]. She's physically matured since then and I knew she'd improved. It wasn't the idea to sit that far back but when I saw him cruise up on her two out, I thought he'd gone too soon. She's got a fantastic turn of foot and a high cruising speed and when you put them together, it makes something special\\". Summer At Royal Ascot on 17 June Quiet Reflection started 7/4 favourite for the second running of the Commonwealth Cup. Donjuan Triumphant and La Rioja were again in opposition, whilst the other seven runners included Log Out Island (Carnarvon Stakes), Cheikeljack (Prix Djebel), Washington, D.C. (Windsor Castle Stakes), Kachy (Molecomb Stakes), Illuminate (Duchess of Cambridge Stakes) and Waterloo Bridge (Norfolk Stakes). After racing just behind the leaders Quiet Reflection began a strong late run a furlong out, overtook Kachy in the last 100 yards and won by a length. After the race Burke said \\"Quiet Reflection is a very good filly. It was not the plan to be stuck in the middle like that and I was praying we didn‚Äôt get a rough race. When she comes through she has a great turn of foot and it has got her out of trouble again.\\" Three weeks after her win at Ascot, the filly was matched against older sprinters in the Group One July Cup over six furlongs on good-to-firm ground at Newmarket. Starting the 7/1 third choice in an 18-runner field she stayed on in the closing stages but was beaten into third place by the geldings Limato and Suedois. Autumn On 3 September Quiet Reflection returned to the scene of her Sandy Lane Stakes victory when she contested the 32Red Sprint Cup and started 7/2 favourite after Limato was withdrawn on account of the soft ground. Suedois, Kachy and Donjuam Triumphant were again in opposition, whilst the other runners were Magical Memory (Duke of York Stakes), The Tin Man (Hackwood Stakes), Dancing Star (Stewards' Cup), Only Mine (Lacken Stakes), Gordon Lord Byron (winner of the race in 2013), Goken (Prix du Bois), Mehronissa (Flying Fillies' Stakes), Strath Burn (Hackwood Stakes), Jane's Memory (Cecil Frail Stakes) and Mr Lupton. Costello positioned the favourite in mid-division before making \\"smooth\\" progress to take the lead approaching the final furlong. Quiet Reflection went clear and won by one and three quarter lengths from The Tin Man, with Suedois two and a half lengths back in third place. Costello commented \\"I've never ridden anything like it and probably never will again. She's push-button go. She won as she liked, she's the real deal.\\" Burke said \\"I know we wanted a bit of rain but I was a bit worried when it got this soft as I thought it might play into the hands of the older horses. She's just got speed to burn. She travels well and is so relaxed. She blows when she works but when she runs she doesn't turn a hair\\". He later said that the filly would probably run next in the British Champions Sprint Stakes at Ascot. In the British Champions Sprint Stakes on 15 October Quiet Reflection started the 4/1 joint favourite in a thirteen-runner field. Racing on good ground she tracked the leaders but was unable to accelerate in the last quarter mile and finished seventh behind The Tin Man, beaten four and a half lengths by the winner. Following the race, Burke announced that Quiet Reflection would remain in training for 2017, stating \\"... she came home fine and she will be back next year, she definitely stays in training. We will sit down with the owners in the next few weeks and plan a campaign for next season; there is plenty to look forward to.\\" The Al Quoz Sprint on Dubai World Cup Night was mooted as a possible early-season target for the filly. =2017: four-year-old season= Martin Harley rode Quiet Reflection in all three of her starts as a four-year- old. On her seasonal debut the filly came home tenth of the twelve runners behind Priceless in the Temple Stakes at Haydock on 27 May. After a break of almost four months she returned in the Listed Renaissance Stakes over six furlongs on soft ground at Naas Racecourse on 24 September and went off the 5/2 favourite against nine opponents. She raced in mid-division before overtaking the front-running Alphabet 150 yards from the finish and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by two and three quarter lengths. Burke commented \\"On soft ground this filly is very good and she can only sharpen up for that run. Win, lose or draw she has been an absolute star for us, and it's just great to get her back. She has a great temperament and has been a pleasure to be around.\\" On her final appearance Quiet Reflection finished tenth in the 2017 British Champions Sprint on 21 October. It was only the third time she had finished out of the prize money. \\"She travelled superbly well and when Martin pulled her out everyone thought she had it in her, but she didn't quicken up like she did last year and it was one of the best sprints for many a year.\\" After the race, she was retired, with a plan to sell her as a broodmare. In total, she won eight times and earned more than ¬£650,000 in prize money. Assessment and awards On 8 November 2016 Quiet Reflection was named Champion Sprinter at the Cartier Racing Awards. She was the only British- trained award winner for 2016 and the first three-year-old filly to win the award since its inception in 1991. On her retirement, Burke commented that, \\"From day one she's been a pleasure to be around, not only for her ability but for her character and temperament, something which I'm sure will be a huge benefit for her next career as a broodmare.\\" Of her career highlights, he said, \\"While for publicity and pure occasion her win in the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot will long remain in my memory, for me her Haydock Sprint Cup win last year was a special performance and confirmed her as a superb three- year-old sprinter.\\" Simon Bridge of the syndicate that owned her, said \\"We could never imagine what she'd do ‚Äì she's been some flagbearer.\\" Social media response to her had been very supportive. It \\"shows she's touched a lot of people's hearts.\\" Breeding record In February 2019, Quiet Reflection gave birth to a chestnut colt, sired by the great Galileo. The colt and Quiet Reflection are now owned by Coolmore following her sale at the Tattersalls Mares Sale.

Concluded in secret in German-occupied Belgium on 24 April 1944, the Plan was intended to lay the foundations for a new political compromise between the different groups after the war based on improved labour relations. It is most notable for laying the foundation for the country's social security legislation adopted by the government of Achille Van Acker in December 1944. Social Pact Officially entitled the Draft Accord for Social Unity (Projet d'accord de Solidarit√© sociale or Ontwerp van overeenkomst tot sociale solidariteit), the Social Pact brought together representatives of Belgium's pre-war trades unions and employers, as well as civil service technocrats, to agree on a number of social reforms to be implemented after the end of the war. Among the most important were the extension of state social welfare provision and collective bargaining in employment disputes. The pact was concluded in secret on 24 April 1944 while Belgium was still under German occupation as labour and company leaders prepared for the period of reconstruction which would follow liberation by the Allies. Most of Belgium was liberated from September 1944. The agreement was conducted unofficially and independently of the Belgian government in exile and never achieved any official status, but remained an influential document on post-war politics. Many of its previsions would be met by the social reforms launched by Achille Van Acker in December 1944. The Pact has been seen as the start of the consensus politics which characterised Belgian post-war democracy, and a move towards more peaceful social relations. According to historian Martin Conway, \\"the real significance of the Pact lay not in the vision it presented of a new era of social welfare but rather in the way in which its preparation demonstrated the degree of common ground that had emerged during the Occupation\\" between different interest groups. Other historians have pointed to the influence of pre-war corporatist ideas.

Noori worked as a translator from 2010 to 2013 and was killed in Afghanistan in 2014. Noori was the first journalist to be killed in Helmand in five years. Noori was also the first to be killed in a week that would be followed by several other killings in the Kabul area, including a suicide bombing the Taliban claimed responsibility for. Personal life Noor Ahmed Noori, 29 years old, was engaged to be married at the time he was murdered. He lived outside of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province which is fairly secure from the Taliban inside the city limits. Noori could speak flaunt English. He was well known and familiar with the local government officials including the civilians who were working with the United States military mission. Career Noori has worked with several different news organizations in Helmand province and he had massive interest with his journalism career. He was a young journalist who worked as a translator at the New York Times from 2010 to 2013. Along with that he has worked with different NGO's and due to his immanence talent he had maintained pretty good reputation among his colleagues.Noori also established English and Computer institution called Khybar and he spent couple of years in that institution to provide quality tuition to his people, As he spent long time in neighbor country Pakistan to acquire knowledge and therefore he was concerned to deliver knowledge and education to his people. At his time of death he reported for a local radio station, Bost as a producer for two religious programs, called \\"Membar\\" and \\"Mehrab.\\" This radio station was known for reports on cultural, religious, entertainment, and social issues. Ahmed Shah Passon, Noori's director at Bost, said Noori had not reported on anything controversial or sensitive at Bost. Death Noor Ahmed Noori's bloodied body was found in a sack at Lashkar Gah, where he lived. Family members, including his brother, said that he had received threatening phone calls before his death. Bost Radio manager said that he was being threatened by anti-government armed militant groups during the recent months. Before his body was discovered, Noori had been missing since 10 a.m. local time. His body was found in a car salesman's yard. Abdul Ahad Coopan, the spokesperson for the provincial police chief said when the bag his body was in was found they believed it was a bomb before further investigating. A forensic doctor at Lashkar Gah hospital had said that Noor Ahmed Noori had been tortured before being murdered. He was beaten and stabbed to death. His death was caused by at least two knife blows to the head and likely strangulation with a scarf. Context Helmand is one of the country's most dangerous regions for journalists. In Helmand a press conference was held, many journalists then stated that they felt powerless against threats they had been receiving to the point in which they are unable to work properly. Although the city of Lashkar Gah, where Noori was murdered, is somewhat secure the Taliban are able to move with considerable freedom. Impact Noori was the first journalist to be murdered in five years, the last murder being BBC reporter Abdul Samad Rohani who was shot to death in Helmand in 2008 The same week Noori died, another journalist in Kabul was murdered whenever a suicide bomber attacked an Afghan army bus in Kabul on Sunday, killing four people and wounding up to 22, police said, the latest incident in a worrying surge of violence in the Afghan capital over the past 10 days. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. Among the victims of Sunday's attack was local radio journalist Shahid Naimi, according to police, who happened to be near the bus when the bomber blew himself up. Abdul Hadi Hamdard, another Afghan journalist, was killed by a roadside bomb in 2012, but it was unclear if he was the target of that attack. Reactions Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"I condemn the killing of Noor Ahmad Noori and Ahmad Shahid. I call on the authorities to spare no effort to improve the safety of journalists. Their work is indispensable to open debate, reconciliation and reconstruction.\\" Danielle Rhodes, the New York Times communications director, said, \\"We are looking into what happened. Our deepest sympathies go out...\\" Abdul Salam Passon, manager for Radio Bost, said, \\"He was a decent person and his programs caused no problems. His voice was known to everyone throughout the providence.\\" Passon also said that Noori was threatened several times, but never elaborated by whom and why. A statement released by Reporters Without Borders said, \\"We extend our condolences to Noori's family and colleagues and we ask the Afghan government to ensure that the investigation promised by Helmand's governor is effective and leads quickly to the identification of this murder's perpetrators and instigators.\\" See also * List of journalists killed during the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent)  References  1985 births 2014 deaths People murdered in Afghanistan Murdered journalists Afghan war correspondents ","title":"Noor Ahmed Noori"},{"id":"51541583","text":"The now-demolished Sackville United Church Sackville Methodist/United Church was a 140-year-old historic landmark in the heart of Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada that was demolished in September 2015 in spite of opposition from many local residents and Heritage Canada's National Trust which placed the church on its top ten list of endangered places.Tower, Katie. \\"Sackville United Church building listed among Canada's top 'endangered places'\\", Sackville Tribune-Post, June 3, 2015, p.4Tower, Katie. \\"SPLASH continues fight to save former church building.\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, April 9, 2014, p.3Tower, Katie. \\"Historic Sackville United Church demolished.\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, September 16, 2015, p.3 The church, built in 1875, was expanded in 1898 in the shape of a Greek cross designed by the noted architect H.H. Mott. Four-metre stained glass ‚Äúrose‚Äù windows, created by J.C. Spence & Sons, adorned the four points of the cross. The church also featured a spire that rose 40 metres, a cast-iron bell weighing more than 500 kilograms, two large transepts, two balconies and a massive, 1928 organ built by Casavant Fr√®res of Saint- Hyacinthe, Quebec with a total of 1,769 pipes. The building was an example of the Gothic Revival style which the town of Sackville describes in its guide to heritage architecture as a 19th-century \\"picturesque style characterized by applied delicate ornament.\\"\\"Heritage pipe organ rescued from former Sackville United Church,\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, October 7, 2015, p.21 The town installed a plaque in 1999 recognizing the Sackville United Church as a place where many generations of Methodists had worshipped after settlers from Yorkshire brought their religion to the area in the 1770s. (The church became known as Sackville United Church in 1925 when the Methodists joined with other Protestant denominations to form the United Church of Canada.) Historically, the church also had a close connection with nearby Mount Allison University. The university was founded in the 1840s as a Wesleyan academy for boys by the local merchant Charles Frederick Allison after his conversion to Methodism. Allison's body lies in the church cemetery. Generations of Mount Allison students attended the church until the university established its own chapel in the mid 1960s. In 2012, as church attendance dwindled and maintenance costs continued to rise, the congregation decided to sell the church to a local developer and move to a smaller adjacent building that once housed Sackville's Town Hall. The decision touched off years of controversy. A local citizen's group offered $175,000 to save the building for use as a community centre, but was unable to buy it from its new owners, JN Lafford Realty Inc. Meantime, local politicians, including the town's mayor, engaged in conflict with volunteers on the municipal heritage board. When the board issued a demolition permit in March 2015, the citizen's group, known as SPLASH (Sackville People Leading Action to Save Heritage), appealed the decision to a provincial planning board. The appeal was unsuccessful; the church was demolished and a four-storey office/commercial/residential building was erected in its place.Hammock, Demian. \\"SPLASH provides update on their efforts with former United Church building.\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, January 28, 2015, p.9.Tower, Katie. \\"Town removes member from heritage board.\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, January 13, 2016, p.2Doherty, Scott. \\"Demolition permit for former United Church remains before heritage board.\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, October 8, 2014, p.5Tower, Katie. \\"Sackville United Church to be torn down: Heritage board votes 4-1 to issue demolition permit.\\" Sackville Tribune-Post, March 25, 2015, p. 2  References  Churches in New Brunswick Gothic Revival church buildings in Canada Buildings and structures demolished in 2015 Demolished buildings and structures in Canada ","title":"Sackville Methodist/United Church"},{"id":"51541597","title":"1960 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541602","title":"1961 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541603","title":"1962 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541605","title":"1963 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541611","title":"1965 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541612","title":"1966 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541614","title":"1967 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541618","title":"1968 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541621","title":"1969 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"51541631","text":"The 1970 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State University in the Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8) during the 1970 NCAA University Division football season.

The field is 1.5 miles long by 1.4 miles wide and is in a general oval shape, stretching northward. This field, although small, is an analog for many of the natural gas fields that occur within the Appalachian Basin. It was first discovered by the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company (now BP) in the early 1930s. It is part of the Utica ‚Äì Lower Paleozoic system, which is estimated to make up 15 to 20 percent of the total hydrocarbon abundance of the Appalachian Basin. A majority of the exploration of the Utica ‚Äì Lower Paleozoic system occurred during the late 1990s into the early 2000s. The explorations efforts were focused on natural gas accumulations in hydrothermal and fractured dolomite in New York, Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Hydrocarbons were first discovered in the late 1880s in much of central Ohio. Since 2002 the amount produced and the remaining reserves comprise 15 to 20 percent of the total discovered oil and gas reserves within the Appalachian basin. Much of the hydrocarbons have been discovered on the east-dipping western flank of the Appalachian basin in both Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania, and western New York. The average depths of reservoirs associated with the Utica shale range from 6,000 to 12,000 feet in depth.  Source rock  The source rock for the Mansfield Natural Gas Field is the Utica Shale. = Lithology = The primary source rock is the Utica Shale. The Utica shale is a black shale that dates to the Late Ordovician age. The distribution of this unit is regionally extensive throughout the entire Appalachian basin. Thickness of the Utica Shale in central Ohio is 180 to 230 ft. and thickens moving east towards Pennsylvania and New York to be 320 ‚Äì 350 feet and 350 ‚Äì 700 feet respectively. The Utica shale unit has little variation over the extent of the Appalachia basin. = Organic content = The Utica shale ranges from 2 to 3 percent by weight within the region. The primary organic continent is Type II kerogen, which is typically associated with oil generation. Based on the Conodont color alteration index it has been found that much of the Utica Shale unit is Mature.  Reservoirs  Generalized cross section of Mansfield, Ohio The reservoir rocks for the Mansfield Natural Gas Field are stratigraphically below the Utica Shale source rock and consist of dolomite, sandstones, limestones, and minor shale units. = Upper Cambrian Cooper Ridge Dolomite, Upper Cambrian Rose Run Sandstone, and Lower Ordovician Beekmantown Dolomite = Upper Cambrian Cooper Ridge Dolomite, Upper Cambrian Rose Run Sandstone, and Lower Ordovician Beekmantown Dolomite compose the lowest reservoir units. The secondary vuggy porosity of the two dolomitic units are a result of extensive leaching during subaerial exposure of stromatolites. The intercrystalline porosity with in the dolomite units is attributed to hydrothermal dissolution. Within the Sun Rose sandstone unit, the primary porosity is attributed to the oversized pores and the occurrence of enlarged intergranular pores. The latter is interpreted as a secondary dissolution process. Both the dolomite units and the sandstone unit have a high presence of fractures that aid in the flow of hydrocarbons.Generalized Stratigraphic Column for Mansfield, Ohio = Black River and Trenton Limestones = Black River and Trenton Limestones are composed of carbonate mudstone, wackestones, and fossiliferous limestones. This unit is the result of a reef complex, which has a high porosity. The major gas and oil reservoir in the Black River and Trenton Limestones are located in northern Ohio and the Southern Tier of New York. This is composed of a medium to coarse grained dolomite, that is highly altered due to the ascending fluids altering the limestone to dolomite. The dolomite is concentrated to sub-vertical fault zones associated with the Proterozoic basement. However, the dominant porosity throughout the Black River and Trenton Limestone in the Mansfield Natural Gas Field is controlled by the fractures. Porosity values in the dolomitized Black River and Trenton reservoirs range from 5 to 16 percent. = Clinton sandstone, Medina sandstone, and Tuscarora Sandstone = Clinton sandstone, Medina sandstone, and Tuscarora Sandstone reservoirs are compositionally mature quartz arenites, sublithicarenites, and subarkoses sandstones that are very fine to fine grained. The cement composition ranges from silica rich to calcite rich. Total thickness of the reservoir unit ranges from 100 to 700 feet over the entire basin. Porosity within this unit ranges from 3 to 15 percent, which is due to the varying degrees of diagenesis of feldspars and the silica cement. = Queenston Shale = Queenston Shale is composed of shale with minor amounts of siltstone and sandstones throughout the reservoir unit. The upper portion of the unit is composed of a sandstone that is classified as a fine-grained quartz arenite. The porosity values of this unit are 3 to 4 percent. There is little to no diageneses in this unit. = Lockport Dolomite = Lockport Dolomite is the primary reservoir rock for the Mansfield Natural Gas Field. The Lockport Dolomite is a microcrystalline dolomite that varies in thickness from 5 to 40 feet, and is linked to bioherm buildups. Porosity in the Lockport Dolomite is highly influenced on the vuggy and molic nature of the dolomite itself. The porosity vaules range from 3.4 percent in the microcrystalline dolomite to 9.6 percent in the vuggy dolomite. = Utica Shale = Chart showing seal, source, reservoir, and critical moment of the Mansfield Natural Gas Field. The Utica Shale is a thinly laminated black shale that is high in organic content, and is the primary source rock in the Mansfield Natural Gas Field. The Utica shale is a relatively thin unit ranging from 50 to 90 feet in thickness and when acting as a reservoir it is self-sourced and highly fractured. Due to the presence of the fractures, it then induces porosity in the unit. However the porosity is relatively low at 1.4 percent. The analog for this is the Utica Shale reservoirs in Quebec.  Hydrocarbon Traps  Traps range from stratigraphic traps formed as pinchouts, Carbonate bioherms, Diagenetic-facies traps and unconformities. While the primary structural traps are low-amplitude anticlines, structural terraces, faulted anticlines, and faults. Traps are typically a combination of the aforementioned mechanisms. The major type observed throughout the Appalachian basin is pinchouts that are transposed against low amplitude anticlinal structures. A minor trapping mechanism is caused by the high mobile water saturation present in certain regions.  Seals  Seals for the Utica ‚Äì Lower Paleozoic system are the sequences of evaporates that compose the Upper Silurian Salina Group. This group is composed of halite, anhydrite, anhydrite dolomite mudstone. However, there are numerous secondary seal rocks throughout the system that include the following: Upper Ordovician Utica Shale, Reedsville Shale, Queenston Shale and Juniata Formation, and the Lower Silurian Rochester Shale and Rose Hill Formation. These secondary seals are only on the local scale due to the presence of fractures and faults allowing the hydrocarbons to escape to other reservoirs.

The canyon entrance is located south of Carmel Valley River at the former settlement of Notley's Landing, north of Point Sur, and at an elevation of 112 feet (34 m).  Etymology  Detail from larger map, Dise√±o del Rancho San Jos√© y Sur Chiquito: Calif., circa 1835, showing the name \\"Arroyo de Palo Colorado\\". Arroyo de Palo Colorado was first named on a dise√±o, a hand-drawn descriptive map of Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito, that was submitted by Jose Castro to the Land Claims Commission in 1853 to prove his title to the rancho.  Road Hand-tinted photograph of local Cowboy Roy Bixby leading pack mules through the redwoods in Palo Colorado Canyon on 1932. The entrance to the road is at the former settlement at Notley's Landing. The first of road winds through a Redwood tree-lined canyon alongside Palo Colorado Creek. It then climbs sharply up a stretch of road to a point known locally as The Hoist and into the Rocky Creek watershed. The name for \\"The Hoist\\" came about because of the very steep road which during the turn of the century required wagon-loads of tanbark and lumber to be hoisted by block and tackle hitched to oxen. The old block and tackle is still chained to a massive log beam, now used to support mailboxes and labeled \\"The Hoist.\\" The road ended at this point until 1950, when the US Army Corps of Engineers began a construction project to extend the road to the North fork of the Little Sur River and future site of Camp Pico Blanco. The road connects to two private unpaved roads to the north. Garrapata Road connects into Garrapata State Park and the other, over Long Ridge, connects to the Big Sur Land Trust's Glen Deven Ranch. Both are only used as fire emergency routes. The road ends after at Bottchers Gap, at altitude, the site of former homesteader John Bottcher's cabin in 1885‚Äì90. It is currently a primitive campsite and trail head into the Ventana Wilderness and the Los Padres National Forest. A locked gate provides access to a long private road leading to Camp Pico Blanco. =Closures= The last five-mile segment of Palo Colorado Road was heavily damaged in January 2017. Heavy rains caused debris to block a culvert under the road and Rocky Creek overflowed Palo Colorado Road at mile marker 3.3. The floods resulted from runoff from lands burnt by the Soberanes Fire. Monterey County installed a temporary bridge at Rocky Creek. The county repaired the road where it crosses Rocky Creek in 2018, but slipouts farther east on the road remain and the road remains closed. The rains caused considerable additional damage to the road between The Hoist at milepost 4.0 and Bottcher's Gap at milepost 7.4. In August, 2018, the county installed a security gate at The Hoist to prevent non-residents from proceeding further. Camp Pico Blanco, Mill Creek Redwood Preserve, and the Bottchers Gap campground and trail head are closed. About 60 homes are in the area beyond the closure. The county estimates the four projects in that area will cost about $11 million. The county does not have sufficient funds to repair the entire road and is applying for federal grants. The cost for all of all repairs along the road from milepost 1.0 to 7.4 at Bottcher's Gap is about $20 million.  History  = Esselen home = Before the arrival of Europeans, the land was occupied by the Esselen people. They had a number of seasonal villages located along the Big Sur coast from near present-day Hurricane Point to the vicinity of Vicente Creek in the south, inland to the upper Carmel and Arroyo Seco Rivers. A large boulder with a dozen or more deep mortar bowls worn into it, known as a bedrock mortar, is located in Apple Tree Camp on the southwest slope of Devil's Peak, northeast of Palo Colorado Road. = Mission era = During the Spanish mission era from 1769 to 1833, the native people were heavily affected by the establishment of three missions (Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo, Mission Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad, and Mission San Antonio de Padua) near them from 1770 to 1791. The native population was decimated by disease, including measles, smallpox, and syphilis, which wiped out 90 percent of the native population, and by conscript labor, poor food, and forced assimilation. Virtually all of the Esselen people's villages within the current Los Padres National Forest were left largely uninhabited. = Rancho era = Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito was first granted in 1835 to Teodoro Gonzalez and re-granted by Governor Juan Alvarado the same year to Marcelino Escobar. It bordered the first mile of Palo Colorado Canyon to the north. It was later owned by Jose Castro and was used for farming and ranching.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco = Homesteaders = Early homesteaders in the Palo Colorado Canyon region included Samuel L. Trotter (January 23, 1914), George Notley (March 21, 1896), and his brother William F. Notley (May 8, 1901), and Andre Cushing who bought a 40-acre patent just east of the mouth of the canyon. After filing a patent for a homestead, the settler had complete ownership after residing on the property for five years or after six months with payment of $1.50 per acre.Blakley, E.R. ‚ÄúJim‚Äù and Karen Barnette Historical Overview of the Los Padres National Forest July 1985 Tanbark Oak trees. The bark, high in tannic acid, was used to cure leather. After the trees were felled, the bark was stripped from the trunks, dried, and then packed out via mule or sleds, called \\"go-devils\\" or on wagons. Notley began harvesting tanoak bark from the canyon, a lucrative source of income at the time. The bark was used to manufacture tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather tanning industry located in Santa Cruz, about 40 miles to the north. Notley constructed a landing at the mouth of the Palo Colorado River like that at Bixby Landing to the south. The tanbark was harvested from the isolated trees inland, corded, brought out by mule back or using wooden sleds, and loaded by cable onto waiting vessels anchored offshore at Notley's Landing. Swetnam and Trotter worked for the Notley brothers, who harvested Redwood in the Santa Cruz area and expanded operations to include tanbark in the mountains around Palo Colorado Canyon. Swetnam married Adelaide Pfeiffer and bought the Notley home at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon for their residence. He also constructed two cabins and a small barn on his patent along the Little Sur River at the site of the future Pico Blanco camp. Road construction and logging left many steep canyons denuded. The resulting erosion clogged stream with sediment and woody debris for decades after loggers cleared the land and moved their timber to mills and coastal landings. = Mill Creek Redwood Preserve = Land to the south of Palo Colorado Canyon formerly owned by Charles Henry Bixby was sold to a lumber company in 1986. Their plan to harvest over a million board feet of redwood was only derailed by the savings and loan crisis, when the land was seized by federal financial regulators. They sold the property to the Big Sur Land Trust, which in turn sold it to the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District in 1988. The district joined it with three adjacent properties to form the Mill Creek Redwood Preserve. The county hired a crew to build a trail from Palo Colorado Road to an overlook, which was completed over ten years. Responding to concerns of canyon residents about traffic on narrow Palo Colorado Road, the county agreed to limit access to six permits per day. Visitors are required to obtain a permit in advance from the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District. The trail head is located inland on Palo Colorado Road. = Palo Colorado Association = The Palo Colorado Association was formed in 1917 and legally organized in 1928. Its purposes are to provide social and recreational opportunities to its members, manage real and personal property belonging to members, provide upkeep of the association property, and to hire a caretaker to manage their properties. It includes the owners of eleven cabins that are more than 100 years old. The cabins are built of whole logs alongside Palo Colorado Creek and within the first three-tenths of a mile near the entrance to the canyon.  Fire impact = Historical fires = In 1906, a fire that began in Palo Colorado Canyon from the embers of a campfire burned for 35 days, scorching an estimated , and was finally extinguished by the first rainfall of the season. On August 26, 1924, a fire started in Danish Creek in the Carmel River watershed. It burned until it was extinguished by rainfall on October 4. This was the largest fire for more than 50 years, until the Marble Cone Fire in 1977. In October, 2007, a fire broke out in a residence in the canyon and spread to nearby brush. About were burned. While fighting the fire, Matthew Will, a bulldozer operator with CalFire, was killed when his bulldozer rolled down a steep slope. = 2016 Soberanes fire = The July 2016 Soberanes Fire was caused by unknown individuals who started and lost control of an illegal campfire in the Garrapata Creek watershed. During the first few days of the fire, it destroyed 57 homes and 11 outbuildings in the Garrapata and Palo Colorado Canyon areas. Fire fighters were able to build lines around parts of the Big Sur community. A bulldozer operator was killed when his equipment overturned during night operations in Palo Colorado Canyon.  Population  The United States does not define a census-designated place called Palo Colorado Canyon, but it does define a ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA), 93923 which extends north to include parts of Carmel Valley and Carmel-by-the-Sea, so it is not possible to obtain census data for the canyon itself. , there were about 300 households in the Palo Colorado Canyon area. The residents raised $300,000 to build a firehouse to house the Mid-Coast Fire Brigade, an all-volunteer unit that offers fire protection to the area.

The game is based on the fictional spy character of James Bond. Gameplay In Shaken but Not Stirred, the player plays as James Bond and must prevent a plot by Dr. Death, who threatens to destroy London with a nuclear warhead unless he receives a ransom. The game begins with a cutscene depicting a jet and its onboard warhead being stolen. The player initially receives a briefing from M, and subsequently chooses from a range of weapons offered by Q. The player may choose three different weapons, which can be used against various enemies. In the game's first stage, the player must traverse around the world to gather clues in the form of anagrams that will help determine the location of Dr. Death's island base. During the first stage, the player must defend against enemies such as midgets, muggers, and priests, as well as unidentified packages. The player may return to London during the first stage to replenish lost health and restock on ammunition. In the second stage, the player must locate the entrance to Death's underwater lair. Once in the second stage, the player can no longer return to London. If located, a secret stock of Benzedrine can be used by the player to replenish lost health. Each location on the island is connected, allowing the player to construct a map. However, the locations change each time the stage is replayed. While on the island, the player must defend against enemies that include scorpions, sharks, and wolves. Upon locating the lair's entrance, the player enters a 10 by 10 room three-dimensional maze. The player must then locate the control room to disarm the nuclear warhead. During the search, the player must avoid Paws, an unbeatable steel-fisted enemy. The player must also avoid a midget enemy named Tac Tac. The player may use a map of the maze up to three times, although the map only appears onscreen for 10 seconds each time it is accessed. When the control room is located, the player must win a puzzle minigame to defuse the warhead and complete the game. Bond then returns to London to drink a vodka martini that has been \\"shaken, not stirred\\" in its preparation. The player can save progress once, but cannot save again once a saved game has been loaded.

She was one of Sweden's first rock musicians during the 1950s. She won her stage name via a bet with another singer who used the same name. She was a founding member of two bands, Trio med Olga and Hafvsbandet. Career At the beginning of her career, in 1958, she was working as a warden at Uller√•kers sjukhus, a mental institution and hospital, where she used to play her guitar during breaks to entertain her colleagues. Her friends entered her in a talent competition called Ungdom med ton (English: Youth with tones). Rock-Olga performed a cover of the 1957 Micki Marlo-Paul Anka duet \\"What You've Done to Me\\" and won the competition. The song also became her first hit and made her one of the first rock stars in Sweden. At the time, another singer known as Stockholms-Olga also used the stage name Rock-Olga. The two artists made a bet with each other, that whichever of them won a significant song competition would also have exclusive right to the stage name. After winning the song competition, Jacobsson travelled to Stockholm with her father, hoping to perform at the popular Nalens dance hall. She would later recall her father talking with the manager of Nalens, Topsy Lindblom, who first stated that \\"lots of daughters can sing\\", but then relented and asked her to come in when Jacobsson's father stated \\"Yes but she can sing rock\\". Her first performance at Nalens caused the resident rock band members to leave their dressing rooms to watch the performance, something that had never happened before. Her solo career peaked in the early part of the 1960s. In 1968, she started her own danceband called Trio med Olga (\\"Trio with Olga\\"). During the 1970s and the 1980s, she was one of the founding members of the rock and gammaldans band Hafvsbandet along with her husband Lars-Christer Magnusson and others. Both prior to and after her time in Hafvsbandet, Rock-Olga performed with another rock band called Rockfolket (\\"The Rock People\\"). In 1972, she recorded an album called Rock Olga Today with three members of the fledgling, soon-to-be-named pop group ABBA: Benny Andersson on piano, Agnetha F√§ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad as backing vocals. She also participated in Alls√•ng p√• Skansen (Sing-along at Skansen), which was broadcast on Sveriges Television in 2008. In later years, she still travelled across Sweden performing as many as 30 concerts per year, usually at retirement homes where \\"What You've Done to Me\\" was always part of her set. Death Rock-Olga developed a fever after performing at Gr√∂na Lund on 8 May 2010, and was subsequently diagnosed with blood poisoning from a cut on her toe. She died from complications on 10June 2010.

The site was on the Missouri River floodplain across the river from Dauphine or Bonnots Mill Chamois, Missouri, 15 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1890 in Osage County. The town of Cote Sans Dessein survived repeated destruction by flooding, until it was finally largely abandoned and its population mostly dispersed. History A Native American settlement near here meant \\"upland forest\\" in the Osage language. Some references indicate that a settlement specifically at Cote Sans Dessein was made around 1803 by a colony of French traders (near the time of the historic \\"Louisiana Purchase\\" treaty). Cote Sans Dessein is a French name often interpreted as \\"coast without design\\". A post office was established at Cote Sans Dessein in 1818, and remained in operation until 1907. At the time of initial Missouri statehood in 1821, the town was among those proposed as the site for the new state capital of Missouri after its transfer from St. Charles, but it was later decided to locate the capital in Jefferson City.Kingdom of Callaway Historical Society \\"A History of Callaway County Missouri 1984\\". Fulton MO: (author published), 1983. Following early destruction by Missouri River floods, the town was relocated about one mile inland from the Missouri River shore in west-south-central Cote Sans Dessein Township, or about 2 miles southwest of the village of Tebbetts.

Mt Vernon IN: Windmill Publications, 1994. The second location was also substantially destroyed by floods, at which time many or most survivors moved elsewhere, followed by the shutdown of the post office in 1907. Etymology \\"C√¥te\\" means \\"coast\\" or \\"shore\\" or (sometimes interpreted as) \\"hill\\" in English; \\"sans\\" usually means \\"without\\"; \\"dessein\\" usually means \\"design\\" or \\"intention\\".Oxford Hachette French Dictionary / Le Grand Dictionnaire Hachette-Oxford, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, 2007. Among the various possible translations, this would logically refer to a river shoreline or possibly a hill-like or island-like formation sometimes altered due to a periodically changing river current. The exact \\"intention\\" of the name would require records of those who originally named the settlement, if such records exist.

It is located at 75 Had≈æi Milentijeva Street in the Belgrade's neighborhood of Neimar, in the municipality of Vraƒçar.Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Belgrade The construction of the church began on 1938. It was halted by World War II in 1941, and continued only in 1987. The cathedral was consecrated in 1988, dedicated to Saint John of Capistrano and with the neighboring objects (old church from 1925, auxiliary edifices, etc.) makes the monastery complex known as the Marijanum, after the Virgin Mary (Marija in Serbian).  History  A group of French business people settled in the area in the early 1920s. Their children were taught by the Assumptionist nuns and the monks, who came in 1924, built the church in 1924-1925, which was colloquially called the \\"French church\\" by the local population. The church was consecrated on 25 September 1925 by Angelo Roncalli, at the time Holy See's apostolic visitor to Bulgaria, and the future pope John XXIII. The school, called the French-Serbian School of Saint Joseph, was officially opened in 1926. Originally within the church, the school was relocated to the Rankeova Street in 1928, where the facilities of the modern Belgrade University Stomatology Faculty are today. In 1930, the monumental belfry was erected, consisting of three bells: the largest was donation of the king Alexander I of Yugoslavia, middle one was sent from the Vatican and the smallest one was purchased from the donation of the adherents. In 1938 the Assumptionists began building a new church, envisioned as the memorial church for the French and Serbian soldiers killed in the World War I, with the addition of the clergy house and the monastery. Marble plates with inscriptions in French and Serbian languages mark the occasion and purpose of the building. The church was designed by architect Branislav Marinkoviƒá. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the new church remained unfinished with only the walls of the building and first levels of belfry being finished. The occupying German forces used it as the ammunition storage. After the war new Communist authorities basically commandeered it. It was used as the storage unit for the factories and medicinal products but, due to the good acoustics, it was used by the Radio Belgrade for taping the music shows and for filming movies. For a while, it also served as the drug rehabilitation center. Facing the diminished interest among the younger generations to serve in the church, the Assumptionists left in 1982. At this time, the state officially returned the church back to the Roman Catholic Church. Catholics took over the church and after almost 50 years continued the construction of the church in 1987. The new church was consecrated and declared a cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Belgrade in 1988. The monastery and the adjoining auxiliary edifices were transformed into the Home of the Saint John of Capistrano. New monumental pipe organ was installed in 2000. As it was actually never fully completed, a massive reconstruction, including the completion of the complex, will start in June 2019. Plans also include the opening of the Museum of the Catholic Church.  Architecture  The interior of the new church was painted in the mixed Catholic-Orthodox manner, sometimes described as the result of the \\"picturesque illustration of the confusing encounter of the East and West in Belgrade\\". Virgin Mary was presented in both traditions, in the Orthodox one in the lower section and in the Western Marian iconography in the upper section. She is surrounded by both the Catholic and Orthodox saints, including the father of the Serbian church, Saint Sava. Other represented saints include Saints Cyril and Methodius, Saint John Capistrano, Saint Cyril of Alexandria and Saint Nicholas of Flue. Remaining from the French Assumptionists, there is a Gallic rooster on the cross above the old belfry. Saint John of Capistrano, whose name bears the monastery, was chosen because of his participation in the successful defense of the city during the 1456 Siege of Belgrade. He personally commanded the detachment consisting of the Crusaders and strongly pushed for the all-European Crusade against the Ottoman Turks. Suggestions for the mix of the Serbian Orthodox motifs in the Catholic church came from France Perko (1929-2008), the archbishop of Belgrade from 1986 to 2001, who wished to show that Belgrade is the meeting point of the West and the East. The church remains the only Catholic cathedral with the image of Saint Sava at the altar.

Schwarz was Jewish and was forced to leave Austria in 1938 when the Nazis took over and he went into exile in Britain. Biography Schwarz was born in Vienna to Jewish parents. His mother died when he was 12 years old, two years before he entered art school in Vienna. With the Anschluss, in 1938, Schwarz was forced to abandon his studies. Shortly, afterwards he left Austria aboard a Kindertransport and made his way to England. His father, a bank clerk, failed to escape Vienna and later died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Arriving in England, the young Schwarz worked as a labourer for a year at Bournville before he was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien. When he was released from internment in 1941, Schwarz enrolled at the Birmingham College of Art and studied there until 1943. Schwarz then spent two years working in a commercial art studio before, when the Second World War ended, establishing himself as a freelance commercial illustrator. He completed several murals for public buildings and also some work for the 1951 Festival of Britain. For almost twenty years Schwarz worked for several high- profile clients, including Shell, the Post Office and BOAC, until in 1964 he decided to concentrate full-time on his painting and sculpture. In 1966 Schwarz and his family moved to Somerset, from Hampstead, where he expanded the range of his work, painting more landscapes, undertaking more sculptures and using watercolours for the first time. From 1970 until his death, Schwarz lived and worked in Greenwich and produced some of his finest work at his studio there. In 1984 the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Schwarz to produce a group portrait of several trade union leaders. The resulting picture of Joe Gormley, Sid Weighell and Tom Jackson in Trafalgar Square with pigeons flying around them is possibly his best known work. Other notable portraits by Schwarz from this period include depictions of Janet Suzman, Nikolaus Pevsner and the poet Ivor Cutler. From Greenwich, Schwarz painted several urban landscapes often featuring the streets in his immediate vicinity but also Canary Wharf and the Isle of Dogs. Schwarz wrote several books on artistic techniques and, with his wife Lena, a book on the Halesowen district of the West Midlands. In 1981, Schwarz won the Hunting Art Prize for a watercolour painting. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he held a number of well-received exhibitions at commercial galleries. These included a series at the Thackeray Gallery and individual shows at the Compton Gallery in 1983, the Ben Uri Gallery in 1985, the Woodlands Art Gallery in 1991, the Sternberg Centre in 1992 and the New Academy Gallery in both 1995 and 2001. The auction house Bonhams sold the contents of his studio in 2004.

His research centers on software update systems, security, and virtualization, with a focus on real-world security problems. Cappos has been a faculty member at New York University Tandon School of Engineering since 2011, and was awarded tenure in 2017. Now an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, he has introduced a number of new software products and system protocols as head of the school's Secure Systems Laboratory. These include technologies that detect and isolate security faults, secure private data,provide a secure mechanism for fixing software flaws in different contexts, and even foster a deeper understanding about how to help programmers avoid security flaws in the first place. Recognizing the practical impact of his work, Popular Science selected Cappos as one of its Brilliant 10 in 2013, naming him as one of 10 brilliant scientists under 40. His awareness of the risks of today's connected culture‚Äîa knowledge strong enough to keep him from owning a smartphone or other connected device, or from using social media like Facebook and Twitter‚Äîhas led to numerous requests to serve as an expert commentator on issues of cyber security and privacy for local, national, and international media. Education and early research initiatives The topic of Cappos' Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Arizona was the Stork Project, a software package manager he built with John H. Hartman, a professor in the Department of Computer Science. Stork is still used today in some applications, but, more importantly, the project called attention to the need for improved security for software update processes, a research area Cappos has continued to pursue. While a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Washington in 2009, Cappos also developed a peer-to-peer computing platform called Seattle, which allows device-to-device connectivity in a decentralized network. Seattle is currently used by thousands of developers, who can access, download, and use the program on any type of smart device. In addition, spin-off technologies, such as Sensibility Testbed, have extended the use of Seattle's security and enforced privacy protection strategies, allowing researchers to collect data from sensors at no risk to the privacy of the device owner. Compromise- resilient strategies In 2010, Cappos developed The Update Framework (TUF), a flexible software framework that builds system resilience against key compromises and other attacks that can threaten the integrity of a repository. TUF was designed for easy integration into the native programming languages of existing update systems, and since its inception, it has been adopted or is in the process of being integrated by a number of high-profile open-source projects. One of the more significant earlier adoptions was Docker Content Trust, an implementation of the Notary project from Docker that deploys Linux containers. Notary, which is built on TUF, can certify the validity of the sources of Docker images. In October 2017, Notary and TUF were both adopted as hosted projects by the Linux Foundation as part of its Cloud Native Computing Foundation.TUF has also been standardized in Python, and been independently implemented in the Go language by Flynn, an open-source platform as a service (PaaS) for running applications in production. As of early 2018, the list of tech companies and organizations using TUF in production include DigitalOcean, LEAP, Kolide, Cloudflare, and VMware. Another significant compromise-resilient software update framework by Cappos is the 2017 launch of a TUF-adapted technology called Uptane. Uptane is designed to secure software updates for automobiles, particularly those delivered via over-the-air programming. Developed in partnership with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Southwest Research Institute, and in collaboration with stakeholders in industry, academia, and government, Uptane modifies the TUF design to meet the specific security needs of the automotive industry. These needs include accommodating computing units that vary greatly in terms of memory, storage capability, and access to the Internet, while preserving the customizability manufacturers need to design cars for specific client usage. To date, Uptane has been integrated into OTA Plus and ATS Garage, two over-the-air software update products from Advanced Telematic Systems, and is a key security component of the OTAmatic program created by Airbiquity.. The Airbiquity project was honored with a BIG Award for Business in the 2017 New Product Category in January 2018, and Popular Science magazine named Uptane one of the top 100 inventions for 2017. Other significant research projects In 2014 Cappos developed PolyPasswordHasher, a secure scheme that interrelates stored password data, forcing hackers to crack passwords in sets. By making it significantly harder for attackers to figure out the necessary threshold of passwords needed to gain access, PolyPasswordHasher-enabled databases become very difficult to breach. PPH is currently used in several projects, including the Seattle Clearinghouse and BioBank. Implementations are available for seven languages, including Java, Python, C, and Ruby. In 2016, Cappos introduced in-toto, an open metadata standard that provides documentation of the end-to-end security of a software supply chain. The framework gathers both key information and signatures from all who can access a piece of software through the various stages of coding, testing, building and packaging, thus making transparent all the steps that were performed, by whom and in what order. By creating accountability, in-toto can prevent attackers from either directly introducing malicious changes into the code, or from altering the metadata that keeps the record of those changes along the supply chain. While working on in-toto, Cappos and the SSL research group identified metadata manipulation as a new threat against Version Control Systems like Git. His team has developed several new approaches to address this problem, including a defense scheme that mitigates these attacks by maintaining a cryptographically-signed log of relevant developer actions. By documenting the state of the repository at a particular time when an action is taken, developers are given a shared history, so irregularities are easily detected. One recent accomplishment in this research arena is Arch Linux integrating a patch to check for invalid tags in git into the next release of its pacman utility. More recently, Cappos and his collaborators have focused on development of a browser extension that can ensure users of convenient web- based hosting services, such as GitHub or GitLab, that the server will faithfully carry out their requested actions.

Specifically within German society, playing sports provided a chance for Jews to gain social standing and even notoriety for their accomplishments. Additionally, cheering for local area sports teams and clubs provided a common (secular) point of interest between Jews and non-Jews. While there are many instances of social integration and acceptance as a result of sports, antisemitism was common at sporting events in central Europe as well. Discrimination, provocation, and riots occurred at sporting events and in response to Jewish athletes, coaches, and managers. As such, the public perception of Jewish athletics was mixed, with notable examples of fame and antisemitism throughout the 20th century. Jews and sports in Germany An example of the success that some Jewish athletes achieved in Germany can be seen through Daniel Prenn, a Russian-born tennis player who competed for the German national tennis team in the 1920s and 1930s. Through Prenn was a Russian citizen, his notable wins for Germany in the Davis Cup helped to bring him the acclaim and recognition that was primarily reserved for non-Jewish athletes in Germany. As a result of his numerous victories, Prenn was featured in an article in the Israelitisches Familienblatt (IF), a German newspaper. While the IF normally relegated articles on sporting events to the secondary sections of the publication, by 1932, sporting articles were often featured with large headlines‚Äîand even photographs of Jewish athletes‚Äîin primary sections of the newspaper. These changes were unprecedented in the IF, and provided hope that sports could become a path for Jews in Germany to reach social integration and equality.Borut, J. (2006). Jews in German Sports during the Weimar Republic. Emancipation through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe, 77ff-87. Additionally, as Jewish athletes such as Daniel Prenn began gaining notoriety for their accomplishments, German publications and spectators became more favorable toward them. In another German publication, Vossische Zeitung, Prenn's success was well documented, with references to German spectators who began to accept Prenn as \\"Our Prenn\\" -- \\"Unser Prenn\\" in German. This acceptance of Prenn, a Jewish athlete, into German society was a large step forward for the Jewish hope to become equal and contributing members of German society. Antisemitism in sports While Daniel Prenn had experienced the acclaim and recognition of success for the German national tennis team in multiple Davis Cup victories, he was not immune to the hate and discrimination that plagued Jews in Germany. After negotiations with a local tennis racquet supplier fell through, Prenn was accused of breaking the laws of amateurism, and was eventually taken to court over the matter. While Prenn was found innocent of these charges, the German Tennis Association still decided to suspend Prenn for a six-month period to resolve the baseless claims. This discrimination against the Jewish Prenn came as a large blow to a younger generation of Jewish athletes in Germany who admired Prenn and his accomplishments. As a result of these allegations and the unnecessary and unwarranted suspension by the German Tennis Association, Prenn ended up leaving the German association in favor of the Jewish sports club, Berlin Bar Kochba. Public perception of Jewish athletes Despite the success seen by many Jewish athletes in German sports competitions, hateful and derogatory comments were still common among German spectators. An example of this rabid anti-semitism occurred during a sporting competition in Rostock, Germany which featured many sports clubs, including Berlin Bar Kochba, which was a primarily Jewish club. After Bar Kochba's athletes began winning many of the events at the competition, chants of \\"Hep Hep\\" were made throughout the crowd of spectators. These anti-Jewish chants (in reference to the Hep-Hep Riots of 1819) nearly pushed Bar Kochba to withdraw and leave the competition entirely. Another example of the rampant antisemitism that plagued Jewish athletes across Europe came from the soccer matches played by Hakoah Vienna, a Jewish sports club in Austria. While derogatory comments were present in any soccer match, these same comments turned into antisemitic comments when Hakoah took the pitch. Comments of \\"Jew pig\\" or \\"dirty Jew\\"‚Äîtranslated from the German \\"Judensau\\" and \\"Drecksjude\\"‚Äîwere common for Hakoah players and supporters.Bunzl, J. (2006). Hakoah Vienna: Reflections on a Legend. Emancipation through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe, 106-115. These actions against Hakoah Vienna were not limited to hateful comments, but extended into rioting as well. In August 1923, at a match between Hakoah Vienna and Ostmark, the Austrian news publication Wiener Morgenzeitung reported that these riots featured verbal abuse and constant antisemitic threats levied against the \\"Jewish pigs\\" of Hakoah. While this publication focused on the riots occurring at that particular match, it made mention of the constant barrage of threats and insults thrown toward Hakoah players and supporters at every match, even at their home field in Krieau.John, M.

He first went to sea aged 14, and in 1910 joined the Terra Nova Expedition, led by Robert Falcon Scott as an able seaman (AS). During the expedition, Scott and other members of the sledging party died, and the Terra Nova returned to England in 1913. McLeod and the other seamen were all awarded the Polar Medal. A year later, in 1914, McLeod joined the Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition, this time led by Ernest Shackleton, again serving as an able seaman. During this expedition, the ship Endurance sunk after becoming trapped in sea-ice. The crew were forced to camp on ice, and then row to the relative safety of Elephant Island, where they were later rescued after Shackleton and some of the men rowed to South Georgia to gain help. During this time, McLeod picked up a bible which had been discard by Shackleton (after removing a few pages).http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/mcleod_thomas.php.

Location Maudlin Castle is located on Maudlin Street, Kilkenny City, just north of the Nore and to the east of Kilkenny College. History Leprosy arrived in Ireland in the 10th or 11th century. Many leper houses were dedicated to Mary Magdalene because of the association between her and sexual excess and prostitution, which were incorrectly associated with leprosy. The Hospital of St. Mary Magdalene in Kilkenny was opened some time before 1327 (perhaps by William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke in the early 13th century) and it quickly became one of the main leper houses in medieval Ireland. It was on the edge of the city and surrounded by high walls. Entrance was controlled through a gatehouse. It also had a chapel, graveyard and 50 acres of farmland. This hospital had a long association with St. John's Priory, Kilkenny. The surviving tower house was built in the early 16th century. The hospital was dissolved in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Maudlin Castle was described as ‚Äòa small castle roofed with tiles, which was built for the defence of the lepers and dwellers in the suburbs, this is now empty and worth nothing‚Äô. There is a reference in 1628 to a ‚Äòtown ditch‚Äô near St. Mary's Church, so there may have been a moat beyond the gate. The hospital was gifted to Kilkenny Corporation by Charles I.

What has changed is accessibility and versatility; users can now perform the same functions and activities of their personal computer on a wide range of devices: smartphones, tablets, and even more recently, smart watches. The increase in personal computing capacity has a profound impact on the way people listen to, promote, and create music. Digital music distribution is still the primary form of music consumption, with three main business models dominating the scene: subscription-based services, a-la-carte, and advertisement-based services (see 2000s in the music industry).

Exclusive Releases Recently, the music industry has seen another consistent decline in album sales in response to the rising popularity of streaming services. As a result, music superstars have been trying a new method for increasing album profits: exclusively releasing their music on a specific digital music distributor. 2016 saw exclusive album releases from music superstars such as Drake, Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Future & Coldplay. Drake's latest release, Views, was exclusively released on Apple Music and set a first-week streaming record at 250 million times worldwide, in addition to 1 million albums sold ‚Äì breaking Justin Bieber's streaming record of 205 million times within the album Purpose's first week of release on Spotify (which has 5 times the subscribers as Apple Music). On the business side, exclusive releases can help digital music conglomerates attract a significant number on new subscribers (depending on the artist) as well as free promotion for the firm. On the other side of the equation, the artist is paid a nominal fee in addition to the streaming revenue. Exclusive streaming may be on the way out just as quickly as it appeared. Record labels have begun to realize that exclusively releasing through one or two streaming services could stunt the long-term growth in subscription music. The upfront fee may be enticing to struggling labels in the short term, but may hurt their overall sales and streaming while the streaming services themselves benefit much more from the PR, new users, and streaming itself. Following the release of Frank Ocean's exclusive release of his album Blonde, Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group banned exclusive distribution with streaming services by UMG artists. But exclusive releases are still poised to benefit both the artists themselves, and the streaming service. It is possible that the practice will continue from superstar artists who record and release music from their own labels (like Frank Ocean did with Blonde). This would be yet another reason for artists to leave their labels; they would reap more financial benefits in cutting out the labels.  Crowdfunding  \\"Rewards based crowdfunding is a collective effort involving a group of people (the crowd, contributors, backers) and a project creator (project owner or campaign manager) to fund a specific venture. The creator of that venture requests from the crowd to contribute small amounts of capital to fund his or her new concept (many of them from his or her immediate social network), which is usually hosted from an internet-based platform. In return for the crowd's contributions, rewards or perks are offered to the contributors from the project itself.\\" Rewards based crowd funding has become increasingly popular within the education, sports, video games, retail, and music industries. = Crowdfunding in the Music Industry = Since Kickstarter's launch in 2009, there have been a total of 46,251 music crowdfunding projects. A 2016 study showed that crowdfunding was especially prominent in young musicians with limited reputations. It has been shown that crowdfunding from small-time artists increases engagement with fans and double as a marketing tool. Crowdfunding is appealing to consumers because it gives fans the unique opportunity to get involved in the creative side of music production. At the same time, if an artist is unable to meet their financial target, they may end up losing credibility with fans (the inability to raise the target financial goal shows a lack of marketing suave and mass appeal from the artist's side). Additionally, big-name artists also seek to benefit from crowdfunding. Music labels are notorious for taking large margins out of music sales, and having an influence on the artist's creative process. Crowdfunding would position artists to make more money on their music sales (don't owe a flat percentage to a music label), and allow the artists to create their music how they please (no pressures from a label to pursue a certain direction or sound). The presence of crowdfunding has steered many artists away from traditional music labels, forcing them to reconsider their traditional approach to music collaboration, financial margins, and marketing. An example of successful crowdfunding can be seen with the band Good Tiger, who is a \\"supergroup\\" in the sense that it is composed of successful musicians from multiple bands. \\"The group was intent on recording this album on their own, and announced the band to the world through a crowdfunding campaign. For a brand new band, this was a fairly risky move, but in less than 24 hours, they had raised over $18,000. By the end of their campaign this figure rose to a staggering $45,980. That sum served as a resounding endorsement from fans that, yes, they were just as excited for this new project as the band themselves.\\"  Remote Music Collaboration  Thanks to the advent of technology (and the digitalization of music recording and distribution), more and more music artists have started to collaborate online as a method for overcoming the physical distance between artists. The music industry has seen more remote music collaboration on the recording side of music in particular; the standard for recording music is digital, and individual audio tracks are easily transferable over the web. It is important to note that some people do prefer the classic way of recording in analog as a way of capturing a specific timbre. But even when people record music in analog, audio tracks can still be digitized and shared the same way. = Example = One example of remote music collaboration for music recording is the band Good Tiger for their debut album, \\"A Head Full of Moonlight\\". \\"With members in various locations throughout the globe, \\"A Head Full of Moonlight\\" was pieced together internationally by a selection of exceptionally talented individuals. Guitars and bass were recorded at Dez's own studio, Playgle Productions. Vocals were tracked both in Los Angeles with Brandon Paddock (Avril Lavigne, Black Veil Brides, Daughtry) and Washington DC (with Dez). Drums were captured in the British countryside at Middle Farm Studios with Adam 'Nolly' Getgood of Periphery fame. Finally, the record was co-mixed by Dez and Nolly, with mastering by Kris Crummett at Interlace Audio.\\" = Applications = Remote music collaboration has also created many new possibilities on both the performance, and educational side of the music industry as well. Right now there are two desktop applications available for the digital musician: LOLA and Ultragrid. * LOLA (standing for low-latency) operates strictly on Window's PCs, and utilizes a low-latency sound adopter for sounds around 6ms. Musician Institutes all around the world have begun to utilize LOLA as way of enabling musicians in different locations, to play music together in real-time. * Ultragrid is an open source application that operates on Mac, PC, and Linux operating systems, with a focus in the transmission of HD audio and video streams in order to enable live, cyber performances. A 2016 study looked into the efficiency of LOLA and Ultragrid for remote music collaboration. The study concluded that a delay between 15ms and 30ms is necessary in order to play music together, remotely. The research also found the following metrics to be important for live, remote music collaboration: quality of sound capture & reproduction, volume, dynamics, space, and echo.

Ardently Fundamentalist, the denomination has its roots in a movement of churches that broke away from Mainline Methodism in the 1940s and 50s. The small denomination comprised sixteen churches as of July 2018. It operates Breckbill Bible College in Virginia. Dr. James B. Fields is the general superintendent of this group, which claims mission work in Suriname, Jamaica, Chile, Nigeria, France, Kenya and Malawi. It is headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee.

A gathering of disaffected Methodist preachers and laymen in 1946 in Memphis, Tennessee, gave rise to the Evangelical Methodist Church (EMC) denomination. This first gathering was inspired by the withdrawal of the pastor of some of Methodism's largest churches of that era, Dr. J. H. Hamblen. Hamblen's exit from a large church in Texas generated significant press coverage, leading to this coalition of conservative preachers and laymen from various pockets of the Holiness movement and Fundamental Methodism. After some prayer and deliberation they began work forming a new denomination to rival what they saw as a liberal trend in the Methodist Church. Among the founders of this movement was W. W. Breckbill (1907-1974). By 1952 differences regarding key doctrines came to the forefront, especially in regard to the Wesleyan tenet of entire sanctification, the eternal security of the believer, and Congregationalism. According to Hamblen, about 20 clergy and laymen led by Breckbill walked out of the 1952 conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania when they could not agree on Wesleyan doctrine of Holiness.J. H. Hamblen, \\"A Look into Life: An Autobiography,\\" pg. 162, (Abliene, Tex.: J.H. Hamblen, 1969) A formal conference was established by Breckbill's allies in 1953. The conference has gone by several names since organization: the Evangelical (Independent) Methodist Churches, the Fellowship of Evangelical Methodist Churches, the Evangelical Methodist Conference, the Evangelical Methodist Church of America, \\"the Fundamental EMC,\\" or simply the Evangelical Methodist Church . The larger EMC pursued legal action against Breckbill's group regarding the name and other intellectual property.J. H. Hamblen, \\"A Look into Life: An Autobiography,\\" pg. 162, (Abliene, Tex.: J.H. Hamblen, 1969) This Fundamental EMC formed Breckbill Bible College in 1957 in Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, named for its preferred founding figure. It is a charter member of the American Council of Christian Churches, a Fundamentalist answer to ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches. According to an observer, the development of a separate, fundamental EMC summarized the tensions between Holiness and non-Holiness conservatives present in many denominations in the wake of the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy. > \\"The history of the Evangelical Methodist Church illustrates the tensions > inherent in a Fundamentalist-Holiness relationship.

Mergers On October 5, 1950, in Shelbyville, Indiana, the Evangelical Zion Methodist Church, founded by Rev. M. D. Opara, of Nigeria, West Africa, was received into the original EMC's General Conference along with about 10,000 members.http://www.cap-press.com/pdf/2096.pdf Ekechi, Felix K., \\"Pioneer, Patriot, and Nigerian Nationalist : a Biography of the Reverend M.D. Opara, 1915‚Äì1965,\\" Carolina Academic Press, 2010. This body aligned with W.W. Breckbill's faction after 1952. A merger with the Southern Methodist Church failed in 1958 when Breckbill's EMC would not accept a condition that the name of the combined church be The Southern Methodist Church.Interview with W.W. Breckbill, June 24, 1961: Bucke, Emory Stevens, \\"The History of American Methodism, Volume III,\\" Abingdon Press, 1964 Beliefs This wing of the Evangelical Methodist movement is more into cultural separatism than the larger EMC body, preferring modesty in clothing and refraining from \\"worldly amusements.\\" It does not teach the doctrine of Entire Sanctification as a second, crisis experience as do many Methodist offshoots but prefers a progressivist view. It is congregationalist in polity. The denomination has more beliefs in common with the distinctly Fundamentalist Conservative Holiness Movement than what is often called the Holiness-Evangelical movement. As recently as 2011, a resolution stated: A prior resolution by the body from the 1990s decried the men's parachurch organization Promise Keepers as \\"an admixture of New Evangelicals, Cultists, Roman Catholics and others forming an unbiblical amalgamation that is anti-Scriptural.\\" Relation to other Evangelical Methodist groups There are many denominations internationally that are unrelated to the U.S. EMCs, including Evangelical Methodist Church in Bolivia, Evangelical Methodist Church in the Philippine Islands, and others.

The society was founded in 1967. The BPS has a wide range of activities, from setting standards in clinical care, offering conferences, meetings, courses for special interest groups as well as publishing the British Journal of Pain. Patients are also actively involved with the work of the society.  Services  Booklets and other resources are available for people living with pain as well as an informative website available to the public to ensure that patients are aware of pain management services and about their pain. A patient liaison committee was created in 2001 to act in an advisory capacity to the Council of the British Pain Society to ensure that the views of patients are represented within the Society. The committee works to improve patient information within the society and at least one member of the committee is invited to sit on each publication working party.  British Pain Society as a multidisciplinary team  Dr. Andrew Diamond (former President) was instrumental in opening membership, allowing professionals who were not clinicians to be able to join and run the Society. Professor Paul Watson (a physiotherapist) notes that he was the first non-medical professional to be part of the Pain Society Council, and he later served as Chairs of the Education Committee and Scientific Committee, eventually becoming the President of the BPS in 2009. Today, there are hundreds of members from different specialties.

There are eleven modules covering wide range of topics from acute to chronic pain, pathophysiology, and basic science bulletins, as well as specific modules such as cancer pain and pediatric pain. These e-learning modules are shared on e-learning anaesthesia (e-LA).

At this time it was for doctors (Consultants) only. This was the first professional society in the world devoted to Pain. * 1979 ‚Äì The IPS of Great Britain and Ireland was registered as a charity. * 1987 ‚Äì The IPS expanded membership to all health and research disciplines for the first time, paving the way for a merger with the existing British Chapter of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and becoming the Pain Society, the British Chapter of the IASP (see below) * 1988 ‚Äì The Intractable Pain Society changed its name to the Pain Society for the first time (this was then reversed by the Council one year later, to be reincorporated a decade later) * 1989 ‚Äì The Pain Society became a chapter of the IASP with the European Federation of Chapters of the IASP formed soon after * 1994-1997 ‚Äì Professor Kate Seers was elected as a co-opted Council member, and as such was the first nursing member of the Council.

This was aimed specifically at medically qualified pain specialists. = Detailed BPS history = The first incarnation of the BPS was under the title of the Pain Group, which subsequently became the Intractable Pain Society of Great Britain and Ireland (IPSGBI) in 1967, with its members being anaesthetists, thus predating the foundation of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), which was founded in 1973. Over time the membership of the society changed to become multidisciplinary and ultimately became known by its current BPS title in 2004. According to Dr William Campbell (former President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary), IASP stated that any pain society in the world must be multidisciplinary and follow the aims and objectives of IASP. Then the society was renamed as The Pain Society (of GB and Ireland). Later, when the Irish members broke away to form their own organization, the Irish Pain Society in 2001, the society ultimately became the British Pain Society (BPS). Pain relief clinics that focused primarily on nerve blocks were pioneered in the United States in the 1930s. The concept spread to Europe post World War II, with the first of these being set up in London, Plymouth, and Liverpool in 1947. Over the next two decades these evolved into more multidisciplinary clinics and by 1967 there were approximately 29 doctors (typically anaesthetists) working in this field in the United Kingdom. On 10 November 1967, the first ever meeting of the society took place at the Salford Postgraduate Medical Institute, University of Salford, UK. This meeting was organised by Dr M Swerdlow and was appointed as the first Chairman of the society, with Dr Mark Churcher and Dr J Challenger being appointed as Secretary and Treasurer respectively. There were 16 founding members, including Prof Sir Michael Bond, Dr Mark Mehta, Prof Birkenham, Dr R Maher and Dr Sam Lipton. Other early members included Prof Iggo, Dr J Hannington-Kiss, Dr John Lloyd, Dr Hugh Raftery, Dr Keith Budd and Dr T Hardy. According to Dr William Campbell, the society was established to attempt to prevent the development of persistent pain without the use of opioids. Early members were mostly anaesthetists, but also included physicians such as Dr R Maher who pioneered the use of intrathecal phenol for cancer pain. It was felt at the time that the society could be considered as a meeting of minds for likeminded individuals.  Controversy  In 2009, President Professor Paul Watson was asked to step down in relation to the controversy surrounding the disputed NICE guidelines for low back pain. A petition was gathered by Dr Chris Wells (current EFIC president) in order to generate an extraordinary general meeting regarding a perceived presidential conflict of interest between the society and NICE. A vote of no confidence was carried out, and a narrow majority voted against Prof Paul Watson remaining as president. Professor Watson had spent over a decade working for the society setting up Annual Scientific Meetings. In his resignation letter, Professor Watson wrote: \\"If there is anything that I can help the society with please don't be afraid to contact me.\\" In recognition of his exceptional contribution and dedication to the BPS, Professor Paul Watson was awarded the Honorary Membership of the British Pain Society at Annual Scientific Meeting held in May 2017. The unprecedented sequence of events left the society without a president and former president Professor Sir Michael Bond was appointed as interim president in order to maintain stability. Prof Sir Michael Bond had not been involved personally in the events. At the time, Professor Sir Michael Bond is reported to have stated 'We deplore the blogs which vilified Paul and which were offensive to your Society and the profession of physiotherapy.' The following year Prof Richford Langford was voted in as President by the membership. 2010 also saw changes in UK government and a controversial reorganization of health service by Andrew Lansley followed, which saw a greater emphasis on primary care via the setting up of new Clinical Commissioning Groups. Professor Langford, in conjunction with Drs Price, Johnson, and Baranowski, as well as over 70 colleagues, had a key role in developing Pain Management Pathways via Map of Medicine in response to the NICE guidelines, which were viewed by many Pain Specialists as significantly flawed. During the years that followed, the BPS had a pivotal role in the National Pain Audit Report carried out by Dr Cathy Price and Dr Stephen Ward in conjunction with the Dr Foster organization. The report discussed the impact of pain and drew on data related to nearly 10,000 new attendees at pain clinics nationally and the accessibility to multidisciplinary care. In addition, the then BPS journal Pain Reviews was reborn as the British Journal of Pain (BJP) under Prof Felicia Cox. The new BJP publishing original pain- related research under the auspices of a professional publishing house. Following a governmental Pain Summit in Westminster organized by the BPS, the RCoA Faculty of Pain Medicine, the RCGP and the Chronic Pain Policy Coalition. Following the Pain Summit, pain related questions were included in the Health Survey for England (HSE) for the first time. The BPS worked in partnership with the Chronic Pain Policy Coalition, to devise questions for this snapshot survey of the nation‚Äôs health. The society is also actively promoting the wider education of health professionals in relation to pain management. In conjunction with the Faculty of Pain Medicine of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FPMRCoA), the society is involved in encouraging the implementation of the EPM Lite teaching method to UK medical schools nationally. This was first taught in Bristol and adopted shortly after at other leading medical schools such as Imperial College London.  50th anniversary  In 2017 the British Pain Society celebrates its 50th Anniversary (founded in 1967). The Annual Scientific Meeting was held from 3 to 5 May 2017. As amalgamation with the British Pain Society to initiate awareness, there will be a group of cycling enthusiasts cycling from London to the annual scientific meeting in Birmingham in a fund-raising campaign. Pain News published in March 2017 summarises the history and evolution of the Society and contains interviews with past presidents including Dr Tim Nash, Professor Michael Bond, Dr Douglas Justin, Professor Paul Watson, Dr Joan Hester, Professor Richard Langford and Dr William Campbell.  Affiliations with other organisations  The British Pain Society is affiliated with the International Association for the study of Pain as well as the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.

In March 1945, the bridge's deck was destroyed by explosive charges laid by the retreating German army. While the arches suffered heavy damage, all five piers survived, preserving the bridge's basic structural integrity and permitting eventual reconstruction. After World War II, the Yugoslav government decided to temporarily repair the bridge for basic use, with a makeshift deck made of iron beams laid across the still-intact masonry piers supporting a one-lane tarmac for motorized vehicle traffic. This temporarily solution lasted for more than five decades, until after the Yugoslav Wars.

He works very hard to make this non-profit organization to be successful for the children and make it fun for the children to come by having a variety of activities everyday. He works to better people's lives and better his community.  Early life  Romero Fuentes was born September 16, 1983. He was raised in Jocotenango, a small neighborhood outside Antigua, Guatemala by his parents, Rudy Romero and Mar√≠a Fuentes. Romero Fuentes witnessed a lot of his friends turning to violence and drug related gangs while he grew up. He soon realized while he was a teacher that his students were growing up in similar conditions. He very quickly came to acknowledge that life living in poverty and violence seemed to feel inescapable to Guatemalan youth, unfortunately, this is a continuous issue in this country. According to the United Nations, Guatemala has the fifth worst homicide rate. He came into contact with families that were falling apart based on different factors such as parents being unemployed, with no more hope or motivation to keep on going. Romero Fuentes' childhood, among other children's, is what led to him to take action and develop the facility and program Los Patojos.  Work and Career  As a teacher, he watched multiple kids struggle with similar things he faced as a kid. The struggles ranged from violence, unplanned pregnancies, and drug use. Having to see these kids go through different forms of conflict daily motivated Romero Fuentes to open up a community center named ‚ÄúLos Patojos,‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúThe Little Ones,‚Äù to help kids if they were willing to receive help. This center would offer many resources such as tutoring help, free meals, affordable medical care, and more. Romero Fuentes' purpose for opening this community center was to give kids the opportunity to be successful, ‚Äúto give them a better present in order to attain a brighter future,‚Äù and to create a safe environment for kids who have been exposed to drugs and violence. The \\"Los Patojos\\" website declares that their mission is to educate, their reason for being is childhood, and their strategy is on dreams and ideas. With the help of his friends and family, Romero Fuentes was able to establish a rewarding community center that started as something little but soon flourished. Los Patojos is a center full of warmth and laughter, a place where children are learning and making friendships every day. Children are learning to love, to trust, to let loose, and to have fun. Some activities that Romero Fuentes arranged within the center consists of art projects, dancing, theatre, writing, and photography. JustWorld International and Los Patojos announced the release of a new book written by Romero Fuentes. The book will be titled \\"Los Patojos' Methodology and Perspectives of the Future\\". This book tells the story of Los Patojos and his journey to create his organization and become a powerful role model. The book will not only be written in Spanish, but also translated into English for one reason being that Romero Fuentes wants to extend the idea of Los Patojos to places throughout the world.  Social Change  Romero Fuentes has impacted over one thousand lives of children ranging from four to twenty- one years old. The non-profit organization, JustWorld International, ‚Äúprovides educations, nutrition, health and hygiene, as well as leadership and cultural development programs for children and young adults, aged four to eighteen.‚Äù Romero Fuentes teamed up with JustWorld International to help support impoverished communities in Cambodia, Guatemala, and Honduras. Los Patojos has not only changed the lives of so many children, but also people who have seen his work. Romero Fuentes encourages children to want to be better people and make them want to help other people because they recognize all of the good that Romero Fuentes does to the community. An idea that somebody thought of from observing Romero Fuentes' work is to make a shelter for kids. One person with the ability to spark a flame in each one of the kids he helps has had an impact one could only imagine. Ultimately, he made a huge difference in the community and then applying it to a global scale, he was able to save kids‚Äô lives. Awards and honors The Guatemalan government granted Romero Fuentes the right to open up an official school with 270 students due to his contributions to the community around him. Romero Fuentes, being the only Latin American nominated, was honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2014. His award led CNN‚Äôs sponsor, Subaru, to donate $250,000 to Los Patojos. Romero Fuentes stated that he did not do this for the attention and reward, but rather to build a better community that is useful to others. He wanted the children of Guatemala to avoid drugs, violence, and poverty as much as possible because he did not want children to experience the things he had to experience growing up. The main focus was to give children a better present so they can live a better future. JustWorld International has supported Los Patojos since the year of 2008 because they take pride in helping over 1,000 children find good education, nutrition, development, and all of the resources that Los Patojos offers.

Carson, (ca. 1838 - April 6, 1862), a captain in the U.S. Army, and served as a scout during the American Civil War under the direction of General Ulysses S. Grant, and as a sideline was a journalist for the Civil War. He was in the Battle of Shiloh at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, Tennessee, USA and was killed there by artillery, which made him the first journalist to be killed during the war. Personal Papers from Grant indicate that Irving W. Carson was born in Scotland, while other records showed he was born in Connecticut in 1838. He moved to Chicago, Illinois, around 1853, when he would have been 14 years old. As an adult, he was described as handsome, 6 foot 2 inches, and thin. He was on the membership lists of the First Baptist Church at the end of the 1850s. He was also a member of the Illinois Republican Party by the time that Abraham Lincoln was elected president. Career Carson was a wagon maker and then he worked for the Illinois Central Railroad in Chicago. He was a conductor. He left the railroad to study law, served as a law clerk until he could practice law in 1860 at 22 years of age. He signed on with the Chicago Tribune as a correspondent while with the Dragoons. =Military service= He enlisted as a private in an organization called Barker's Dragoons, which lasted from April 19 to August 18, 1861. The men that belonged to these Independent Illinois Volunteer Cavalry Companies refused to enlist for 3 years. While some members broke away from Charles W. Barker, Carson stayed loyal. As a member of the Dragoons, he served as a scout for Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss. Later, he became a scout for General Ulysses S. Grant at the rank of captain. According to Grant, correspondence on March 26, 1862, indicate that Carson traveled to reach General Don Carlos Buell, by walking for four days and passing three Confederate States of America camps. Death While reporting to Grant on the first day of the battle at Pittsburgh Landing, Capt. Carson was near Buell and Grant at the Battle of Shiloh sometime around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. in the evening of April 6, 1862. Shells had already killed men close by them. When Carson stepped away to encourage men to fight, he was killed by a cannonball that hit him in the face. The incident is often described as ghastly or horrific. On the second day, Grant led his force to victory over the Confederate Army. =Funeral= Carson was given full military honors at his funeral that was held at First Baptist Church in Chicago on April 20, 1862. The procession happened on Laselle Street, it involved a cavalcade and many officers who served him. It went all the way through the city and ended at Rosehill Cemetery, where his ashes were buried among the other Civil War soldiers. Context After the Battle, members of the military, including General William Tecumseh Sherman, and the public, were angry that General Grant had not properly acknowledged Carson and others for their role. Carson was reporting to Grant as a military scout at the time of death. Albert D. Richardson, correspondent for the New York Tribune, had knowledge that Grant was behind the batteries, conversing with an officer when Carson was killed, spattering Grant's clothing with blood. Richardson, along with Charles B. Kimbell, worried about the reputation of a revered general officer, but it was important to know that Grant had nearly been killed. It was Carson's death that led Ebenezer Hannaford to state, \\"But what shall we say of this case, where a brave man met the most tragic of deaths, and his name- nay, even his fate- was not so much hinted.\\" Impact During the Civil War, between eight and 16 journalists lost their lives either through sickness or battlefield-related causes, including Carson. It's possible that Carson's connections to the Chicago Tribune and his serving under Grant eventually promoted him to Captain. Both Carson and L. Walter Buckingham of the New York Herald have both been killed as a result of enemy action during the American Civil War. Buckingham died in Virginia, June 23, 1863. Reactions Ebenezer Hannaford and the soldiers in the 10th brigade said that Carson's death was a ghastly event that became part of the history of the 6th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. General Sherman himself expressed great displeasure with Grant's failure to say anything about the death of Carson. Sherman had every member who commanded troops at battle provide statements for protection against such untruthful assaults in the future. Almost 140 years later, descriptions of Carson's murder still focused on the image of his partially severed head.

In the event of an angled impact MIPS can reduce harmful rotational forces, which may be transmitted to the brain, by allowing the helmet to slide relative to the head. These rotational forces can cause concussions or even worse brain damage. MIPS stands for Multi-directional Impact Protection System. The technology was developed by specialists at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and a brain surgeon at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1996. The yellow layer is the MIPS BPS.  Rotational motion  To understand the functionality behind MIPS BPS, it is important to know what rotational motion is, and why it is so harmful to the brain. Rotational motion, in this case, is the result of the brain continuing to move or stretch after the head has come to a quick and sudden stop following an angled impact. Several researchers have linked severe brain injuries like Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) and Subdural Hematoma (SDH) to the transmission of rotational motion to the brain from angled impacts. Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) or concussion is also believed to be caused by rotational motion.  Functionality  In a helmet equipped with the MIPS technology, a low-friction layer allows the helmet to slide relative to the head, resulting in a reduction of the rotational motion that may otherwise be transmitted to the brain. In this way, the MIPS approach mimics the natural safety system of the human head. The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid that protects it by allowing the brain to slide inside the skull when exposed to an angled impact. Mimicking the cerebrospinal fluid, MIPS adds a low friction layer that enables a relative movement of 10‚Äì15 mm between the head and the helmet in any direction. The MIPS BPS is integrated by the manufacturer. It cannot be retrofitted by the consumer.  History  In 1996, Swedish neurosurgeon Hans von Holst began evaluating the general construction of helmets. Following several years of study and work related to head trauma for the World Health Organization in Geneva, he determined that existing helmet technology provided inadequate protection against brain trauma, often with devastating consequences for the victims of brain injuries. Together with Royal Institute of Technology researcher Peter Halldin, von Holst developed a technology that was designed to provide a more effective protection against brain trauma. To evaluate the risk of different types of head injuries and to simulate impacts were a person is wearing a helmet, they used the Finite Element Model (FE Model), developed by Svein Klein, Professor at Sweden‚Äôs Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). After thoroughly evaluating the brain anatomy, physiology, and combining their years of testing and expertise, von Holst and Halldin produced what is now known as the MIPS Brain Protection System, a technology that mimics the brain‚Äôs own protective structure. * The company MIPS AB was founded in 2001 by five specialists in biomechanics of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. * Following its inception in 2001, MIPS AB evolved from concept to product, introducing the technology in an equestrian helmet 2007. At that time MIPS had their own helmet model but they changed their business model to be an ingredient brand, offering their product to existing helmet brands. As MIPS grew internationally, it debuted the now instantly recognisable ‚ÄòYellow Dot‚Äô branding in 2009, giving the Stockholm- based company a clear and distinct identity in logo and across all online platforms. * In 2010, MIPS AB expanded into the bike and snow helmet industries, gaining widespread acceptance as both the technology, and awareness of head trauma became increasingly recognised in similarly risky sports. * In early 2014, one of the world‚Äôs largest helmet manufacturers, BRG Sports, Inc. and MIPS AB entered into a formal partnership after several years of sharing their technology, offering MIPS‚Äô technology to a much wider global audience. Since then, MIPS AB has added several new brands to its catalog and has expanded to the American, European and Chinese markets. * Towards the end of 2015, MIPS made its millionth layer, and by the end of 2019, it had produced 14.2 million layers across 583 different helmet models from 103 helmet brands. * Another big step in the history of MIPS occurred in 2017, when the company was listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, attracting more than 3,000 shareholders at the time. Today, MIPS has over 7,500 shareholders. * In 2019, the founders Peter Halldin, Hans von Holst and Svein Kleiven received the prestigious Polhem Prize, the oldest and most prestigious technical Swedish award. * In the beginning of 2020, MIPS have produced more than 14.2 million layers, are working with 103 brands and there are 583 helmet models that have MIPS BPS inside.

In 2015 Pine Microsystems offered its first product, the Pine A64, a single-board computer designed to compete with the popular Raspberry Pi in both power and price. The A64 was first funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding drive in December 2015 which raised over $1.7 million. The Kickstarter project was overshadowed by delays and shipping problems. The original Kickstarter page referred to the Pine64 Inc. based in Delaware, but all devices for the Kickstarter campaign were manufactured and sold by Pine Microsystems Inc. based in Fremont, California. In January 2020, Pine Microsystems Inc. was dissolved while Pine Store Limited was incorporated on December 5, 2019 in Hong Kong and store.pine64.org claims to operate under the laws of Malaysia and China.https://store.pine64.org/?page_id=435  Devices  After the initial Kickstarter orders for the Pine A64 single board computers had been satisfied, the company went on to create several successors and later also added notebooks and a smartphone to the \\"Pine\\" family. = Single-board computers = The original Pine A64 boards released in 2016 are powered by an Allwinner A64 system-on-chip. It features a 1.2 GHz Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 64-Bit Processor, an ARM Mali 400 MP2 graphics processor unit, one HDMI 1.4a port, one MicroSD slot, two USB 2.0 ports and a 100 Megabit Ethernet port. The A64 board has only 512 megabytes of RAM, the 1 GB and 2 GB versions are labeled \\"Pine A64+\\". While the 512 MB model only works with Arch Linux and Debian GNU/Linux distributions, the A64+ with more memory can also run other operating systems including Android, Remix OS, Windows 10, FreeBSD, and Ubuntu. Optional eMMC storage modules can be plugged into special headers on the board. A compute module called SOPINE A64 was introduced in January 2017. It features the same system-on-chip as the Pine A64, but mounted on a SODIMM DDR3 form factor board without the USB/HDMI/Ethernet connectors. It competes with the Raspberry Pi Compute Modules. Pine64 sells a \\"Clusterboard\\" with an inbuilt 8-port Gigabit Ethernet switch which can be used to build a cluster system out of up to seven SOPINE modules. A review by Hackaday noted problems with production quality, software, and user support. 2017 also saw the addition of a \\"Long Term Supply\\" (LTS) version of the Pine A64/A64+ boards called \\"Pine A64/A64(+)- LTS\\". The LTS versions are identical to the A64/A64+, but are guaranteed to be available until the year 2022 at a slightly higher cost. In July 2017 the company added a new line of single board computers based on Rockchip SoCs. The ROCK64 features a Rockchip RK3328 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor, a Mali-450MP2 GPU capable of playing 4K HDR videos, 1/2/4 Gigabytes of RAM, two USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI 2.0 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, a MicroSD slot and several other peripheral ports. Its larger brother, the ROCKPro64, is based on a Rockchip RK3399 Hexa- Core (dual ARM Cortex-A72 and quad ARM Cortex A53) 64-Bit Processor instead. It features a Mali T-860 Quad-Core GPU and, in addition to the standard USB/Ethernet/HDMI/MicroSD ports, also has an eDP interface and an open-ended PCI Express x4 slot. An optional PCI Express to Dual SATA-II adapter and an optional Wi-Fi module are offered by Pine64 In 2019 a new Allwinner-based board was added as a direct competitor to the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. The Pine H64 is based on the Allwinner H6 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor. It features a Mali T-722 GPU, two or three Gigabytes of RAM, two USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI 2.0 port, onboard 802.11n Wi-Fi, a Gigabit Ethernet port, a MicroSD slot and several other peripheral ports. = Notebook computers = Pinebook Pro In November 2016 the Pinebook, a netbook built around an Allwinner A64 SoC with 2 GB of RAM and a 16 GB eMMC module was announced. Pre-release comments in Make wrote that the A64's closest analog was two to three times the A64's price, and that the A64 continued the Raspberry Pi's trend of breaking barriers for engineers. Production started in April 2017. The Pinebook can only be obtained via a build-to-order system, potential buyers have to wait weeks or even months for an order code which then has to be redeemed within 72 hours. The hardware is priced at 99 US-$, but due to a 30 US-$ shipping fee and country-dependent import duties and taxes the final price is higher. The Pinebook was notably used by the KDE team to improve Plasma on ARM desktops. In a review of final hardware by Linux.com, the reviewer was surprised at his ability to have the full, albeit slow, Mate desktop environment at the A64's price. Phoronix's benchmarks indicated similar CPU performance to a Raspberry Pi 3. In July 2019 the company announced the PineBook Pro, a netbook based around the Rockchip RK3399 SoC which is also used in the ROCKPro64. The preorder system went live on July 25, 2019. The device is priced at 199 US-$, though the final price after shipping and import duties/taxes is higher. On March 15, 2020, it was announced that the PineBook Pro will ship with Arch Linux based Manjaro Linux as the default operating system. = Smartphone = , Pine64 is working on a Linux smartphone, PinePhone, using a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 64-Bit System on a chip (SoC). The aim is for the phone to be compatible with any mainline Linux kernel and to \\"support existing and well established Linux-on-Phone projects\\", as a community developed smartphone. After a initial BraveHeart release for early adopters in February 2020, the company continued releasing Community Editions that incrementally improve the design. The community support has been very good, with 17 different OS already released for the device. = Smartwatch = In September 2019, Pine64 announced the PineTime smartwatch. It is meant as a community driven software development smartwatch platform and positioned as a complementary device to the PinePhone. = Tablet = In May 2020, Pine64 announced the PineTab tablet, with optional detachable backlit keyboard. It is a 10\\" tablet based on the same technology as the PinePhone, but without the modem and kill switches of that model.

Published in England by Hodder and Stoughton in 1947, it did not appear in the United States until 1963. By then Gilbert's reputation had been firmly established in both countries and his regular American publisher for many years had been Harper & Brothers. Close Quarters, however, was published by Walker and Company, a less prestigious house. In it we are introduced to Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, who will go on to be a recurring character in a number of Gilbert's works throughout the next ten years. Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Golden Age conventions A series of deaths, the first one an apparent accident, takes place in the normally quiet cathedral town of Welchester, more particularly within the \\"Close\\" of the 500-year old cathedral itself, \\"Close\\" being the English word for the precincts of a cathedral. \\"Educated at Blundell‚Äôs, a well-known private school, and London University, Gilbert had a short spell as a schoolteacher before the Second World War.... By then his enthusiasm for detective fiction had prompted him to start work on Close Quarters... conceived in the spirit of Golden Age mystery writing.\\"Martin Edwards Golden Age mysteries had been popularized throughout the 1930s by writers such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Michael Innes and had informally created a number of conventions that are to be found in Close Quarters. The setting here is the tightly limited confines of the cathedral Close and those few houses within its exterior walls, much as many Golden Age stories were set in isolated country houses; two full pages are devoted to a complete cast of the \\"householders\\" inhabiting the Close; the main characters (and suspects) are strictly limited to those ecclesiastics living within these confines; we have three full-page diagrams showing the grounds of the Close with its cathedral and houses; an inspector and detective sergeant are sent down from Scotland Yard to conduct the inquiries; a loving imitation of a London Times crossword puzzle is presented, along with its recondite clues, and is the subject of an entire chapter, with three iterations of the puzzle itself being shown as it is gradually filled in by two of the story's scholarly characters; there is much leisurely description of the cathedral, the neighboring houses, and of the characters themselves; and there is one lengthy red herring in which the detective sergeantA pleasant young fellow, Sergeant Pollock is the cathedral Dean's nephew and one of the major characters in the book; in the first few pages of Gilbert's next book, however, They Never Looked Inside, we learn that he has been tortured and killed by post-war London gangsters. follows two of the suspects to London to no great purpose. And finally, of course, Inspector Hazlerigg deduces the identity of the murderer, contrives to trick him into an incriminating act, and then explains all of the story's most baffling events to a gathering of the surviving characters. Credibility As in many of the classic works of this type, the likelihood of some, or perhaps even all, of the events in the story cannot withstand prolonged scrutiny. In the case of Close Quarters, it strains credibility to imagine that Canon Whyte's \\"accidental\\" death by falling over a chest-high wall near the top of the cathedral to the ground below a year earlier would not have been mentioned by the inhabitants of the Close or by the local police to the Scotland Yard detectives investigating the death of a second body later found in the identical spot. Characteristics Characteristic of much of Gilbert's work over the next half-century is his use of teen-aged boys as relatively important characters‚Äîin this he is practically unique in the field: in very few of his peers' works are any characters except adults shown. Also characteristic of his works to come is the growing blackness he brings to the story as it progresses. What begins here as a relatively light-hearted depiction of the Close and its ecclesiastic inhabitants becomes darker and grimmer as the events unfold in sometimes surprising ways. As one of his editors said after Gilbert's death in 2006, \\"He's not a hard-boiled writer in the classic sense, but there is a hard edge to him, a feeling within his work that not all of society is rational, that virtue is not always rewarded.\\"Douglas Greene of Crippen & Landrau, quoted in The New York Times, 15 February 2006 Such is the case here. Reception and/or Appraisal The New York Times did not review the book upon its publication. A much later appraisal comes from Barzun and Taylor's encyclopedic Catalogue of Crime: > One of the good stories of murder in godly surroundings, it was the author's > first attempt at detection, written while he was a schoolmaster at > Salisbury. He now considers the tale cluttered, but the plan showing who was > where in the close of Melchester Cathedral on the critical evening makes > clear the theories of the official and unofficial detectives: Chief > Inspector Hazlerigg and the dean's nephew.Jacques Barzun & Wendell Hertig > Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime, Harper & Row, New York, \\"Second Impression > Corrected\\", 1973, page 208 Notes External links : 1947 British novels Hodder & Stoughton books British mystery novels ","title":"Close Quarters (Gilbert)"},{"id":"51543008","text":"T.

Lippy was the athletic director of or an instructor at the Seattle YMCA before he and his wife Salome headed north in search of gold in 1896 or 1897 after an injury forced him to leave his YMCA job.Berton, p. ? Some Scotsmen from Nanaimo had staked claims Fourteen to Seventeen on Eldorado Creek.Berton, p. 54 They decided to abandon Sixteen and Seventeen in order to concentrate on some other claims. Lippy had a claim further up the creek, but restaked Sixteen because his wife wanted a cabin, and there was timber there. Sixteen proved to be one of the richest claims of the gold rush. Salome Lippy was the first white woman in the area, until she was joined by Ethel Berry. Clarence and Ethel Berry, who also became rich, were neighbors of the Lippys, living a mile away. On July 25, 1898, the Lippys arrived in San Francisco aboard the Excelsior, the first ship to reach the lower United States from the Klondike with now-wealthy prospectors; the Lippys brought with them gold valued, according to the Chicago Tribune, at \\"not less than $200,000.\\" He sold his holdings in 1903. He and his wife went on a worldwide tour, before building a lavishly decorated 15-room house in Seattle. He gave generously to the YMCA, the First United Methodist Church and the Anti-Saloon League, and donated the land for a five-story addition to the Seattle General Hospital. He also established a free hospital for miners in Dawson City, and sent \\"a library of 1000 volumes\\" to Skagway, Alaska. He won the 1907 Pacific Northwest Amateur golf tournament and was the Port Commissioner of the Port of Seattle from 1918 to 1921.

While having the appearance of the rigging of a 19th-century clipper ship, it was not actually implemented on a sailing vessel until several decades after its design because of a lack of adequate construction materials. It was fitted to one of the world's largest yachts, the Maltese Falcon. When the original patent rights and residual technology were purchased from the German government by an American investor in 2001, it was renamed the Falcon rig. The DynaRig, along with the original, \\"DynaSchiff\\", is a trademarked name. The original concept by Pr√∂l√ü was for a combined rig and hull with extremely high efficiency of operation and the use of wind power to propel a large vessel across an open body of water. The modern controller for the entire ship's rig consists of a single panel operated by a single person. The masts are freestanding, the curved yards being attached rigidly to the masts. To adjust the angle of the sails, the entire mast rotates in place. When fully deployed, the sails on each mast have no gaps between them, creating a single panel to capture the wind. It is estimated to have twice the efficiency of a traditional square rig. The design for the rig of Maltese Falcon was formalised and tested by Dutch naval architects Dykstra Naval Architects, and engineered and built by Insensys Ltd. on the premises of Perini Navi in Istanbul. In 2016 a similar rig designed and engineered by the same team was built by Magma Structures in Portsmouth and fitted to the 106 m vessel Black Pearl built by Dutch shipyard Oceanco in Alblasserdam and designed by Italian Nuvolari Lenard.

She served in the U.S. State Department for over forty years and was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1979. Biography Marjorie Millace Whiteman was born in Liberty Township, Ohio, in 1898. She graduated from Wauseon High School and later Ohio Wesleyan University in 1920 and went on to get L.L.B. (1927) and J.D. (1928) law degrees from Yale Law School, where she served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal. She did some further studies at National University and was a Carnegie Fellow in international law, which became her specialty. Whiteman taught high school history from 1920 to 1926, and then in 1929 took up a post with the State Department, beginning a career that lasted four decades and during which she advised ten Secretaries of State on international law. For part of this period, she served as special assistant to Green Hackworth, then the department's legal adviser. She helped to draft the charter of the United Nations in 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights three years later. From 1945 to 1951 she acted as an advisor to former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who was then serving as the United States representative to the United Nations General Assembly. She also participated in many Pan-American conferences, notably the one in 1948 at which the charter for the Organization of American States was drafted. When the State Department was reorganized in 1949, Whiteman was named the first Assistant Legal Adviser for American Republic Affairs. Whiteman was a key contributor to Green Hackworth's eight- volume Digest of International Law (1937‚Äì1943) and capped her career by later publishing her own 15-volume Digest of International Law, completed in 1969. Her digest included sections on new and emerging areas of international law, including outer space and aviation, disarmament, Antarctica and the Continental Shelf, and international organizations.

Modi is being investigated in a $2 billion fraud case of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and is also being sued in the State of California for US$4.2 million for defrauding Los Angeles entrepreneur, Paul Alfonso, over two custom diamond engagement rings that turned out to be lab diamonds. In March 2018, Modi applied for bankruptcy protection in Manhattan, New York. In June 2018, Modi was reported to be in the UK and has applied for political asylum in Britain.Behind bars: India's 'Diamond King' Nirav Modi's fall from grace, John Zubrzycki, The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 April 2019 In June 2019, Swiss authorities have frozen a total of 6 million US dollars present in Nirav Modi's Swiss bank accounts along with the assets.  Biography  = Early life= Nirav Modi was born in Palanpur, Gujarat, and grew up in Antwerp, Belgium. His family has been in the diamond business for several generations. When he was 19, he and his father Deepak Modi moved to Mumbai to work in his uncle's business, Mehul Choksi, the head of Gitanjali Group, a retail jewellery company with 4,000 stores in India. Modi attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania but eventually dropped out. While studying, he met his future wife, Ami, the daughter of a diamond businessman Amukuraj Choksey. = Career = After moving to India in 1989, and training in all aspects of the diamond trading business, he founded Firestar in 1999 (Formerly known as Firestone), a diamond sourcing and trading company. Firestar is the exclusive distributor of Rio Tinto‚Äôs Argyle pink diamonds in India. In 2002, his company started manufacturing jewellery on a contract basis. He acquired Frederick Goldman in 2005, and Sandberg & Sikorski and A.Jaffe in 2007 in the USA. In 2008, a close friend asked Nirav Modi to make a pair of earrings, after which he created the brand. In 2010 he launched a diamond store bearing his name in New Delhi's Defence Colony, followed by one in Mumbai's Kala Ghoda. 17 other store openings followed across the world. Nirav Modi launched globally with boutiques in New York City and Hong Kong in 2015, followed by two other boutiques opened in Hong Kong in 2016., and one in MGM Macau in 2016. He became well known after he designed his \\"Golconda Lotus Necklace\\" with an old, 12-carat, pear-shaped diamond as a centerpiece in 2010. The diamond was earlier sold in the 1960s; it was repolished. It featured a lattice of white and pink diamonds. It was included on the cover of Christie‚Äôs catalogue in Hong Kong, and was auctioned for US$3.6 million in 2010. In 2012, the Riviere of Perfection, featuring 36 flawless white diamonds weighing a total of 88.88 carats, was sold at Sotheby‚Äôs Hong Kong auction. It is believed that he was overextended for several years and used new MOUs to pay for the past ones for about seven year. One of his employees has stated that \\"He wanted to grow his business, and to do in five years what might otherwise have taken 20 years.\\" he claimed that \\"If he‚Äôd gone public, maybe he could have pledged his equity, raised some money, and finally paid the bank back. Perhaps he would have done that.\\" Dealings with Union Bank of India The Union Bank of India sued Nirav Modi in a Hong Kong court. Union Bank claimed in a writ filed at the High Court on 26 September 2018 that Nirav Modi guaranteed two loans made to Firestone Trading Private on 21 October 2011 and Firestar Diamond on 15 November 2011. The bank demanded that Nirav Modi pay more than $5.49 million plus interest after both firms allegedly defaulted on repayments. 2018 Investigation and Lawsuits (PNB fraud case) In February 2018, the Indian government's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) launched an investigation of Modi, acting on a complaint from the Punjab National Bank alleging Modi and his partners defrauded the bank of ‚Çπ28000 Crore (approximately USD 4 billion) by conspiring with bank officials to fraudulently obtain Letters of Undertaking for making payments to overseas suppliers. While ‚Çπ28000 Crore is the fraud that has been alleged to date, the potential loss to Punjab National Bank is reported to be up to ‚Çπ11000 Crore. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is looking into the case of fraud that the CBI has registered against Modi. A few of Modi's stores initially remained open for business as usual, including the one at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, however these have gradually all closed. On 7 March 2018, Modi's firm Firestar Diamond Inc. applied for bankruptcy protection at a Manhattan bankruptcy court, in order to protect its assets in the United States and their revolving credit facility with Israel Discount Bank. Modi responded to the bank on 15/16 February 2018, stating that \\"In the anxiety to recover your dues immediately, despite my offer (on 13 February, a day before the public announcement, and on 15) your actions have destroyed my brand and the business and have now restricted your ability to recover all the dues leaving a trail of unpaid debts\\". Modi estimated his domestic business at around Rs 6,500 Crore, and said \\"this could have helped reduce/discharge the debt to the banking system,\\" but claimed that this is now impossible as all his bank accounts have been frozen and assets have been seized. Modi bought a Rs 900 crore sea-facing property in Mumbai's coveted Samudra Mahal properties with his wife Ami Modi. His properties in India, including jewellery, paintings, and real estate, worth about Rs 523 crore (about $75 million) have been attached by the Enforcement Directorate. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached four wind power plants, owned by Modi, in Rajasthan with a total capacity of 9.6 megawatt (MW). The plants earn up to Rs 5 crore a year due to share purchase agreement with Rajasthan's state electricity board. These wind power plants have been operational since 2014-15. In March 2018, the ED had attached a 5.24 MW solar power plant spread over 135 acres in Karjat in Ahmednagar district worth Rs 60 crore. In May 2018, the CBI and the ED had registered two FIRs each to probe the case. Both Modi and Mehul Choksi are said to have left the country before criminal cases were lodged against them. With the collapse of his brand, Modi's fortune has collapsed. Forbes removed him from their annual billionaires list, and on 9 March 2018, estimated his current wealth to be less than $100 million. As a result of the fiasco, the RBI has stopped issuing LoUs and LoCs for imports, which has limited the financial flexibility of importers. His company, A.JAFFE, acquired through his Synergies Corporation, was auctioned in May 2018 and was purchased by Parag Diamond. All the stores have been since closed. In April 2018, it was alleged Modi had found safe haven in Hong Kong, but in June of that year he was reported to be in the UK where he applied for asylum, claiming he was a victim of \\"political persecution\\" and denying any wrongdoing. In March 2019, Modi was reported have been sighted in the UK by The Telegraph. It was said that he was living in an apartment costing ¬£8 million. Indian authorities responded to the report by saying that an extradition request had been made to the UK. On 20 March 2019, Modi was arrested in London after a warrant was issued against him. Later that month, Indian tax authorities raised $8m by auctioning some of Modi's art collection. Modi applied for bail in the UK High Court on May 31, a day after his remand was extended. All Nirav Modi's requests for bail have been rejected as of October 2020. Nirav Modi is scheduled to appear in his ongoing extradition trial on November 3. On 8th June, 2020, The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) Court has ordered a confiscated of nearly Rs 1,400 crores worth property of Nirav Modi.

Personal life Nirav Modi is married to Ami Modi, they have three children (two daughters and one son). They met when both were students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, although Modi himself dropped out after a year to return to the diamond business. Ami is a US citizen by birth. In spite of having been a billionaire family earlier, they have attempted to raise children conservatively, and they only use Gujarati in their home. She ran the \\"Nirav Modi Scholarship for Excellence\\", which supported 250 students every year. After leaving India, they had been reported to have been living in a JW Marriott Essex House suite in New York City.

Hart lists Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and current folk artists Fionn Regan and Sam Amidon as musical inspirations. Through international travel with Boy & Bear, Hart explored his solo songwriting capabilities and crafted an album‚Äôs worth of material that champions his skills as a lyricist and musician. While recording Moonfire (2011) in Nashville, Tennessee, and facing difficulties and hindrances in this recording experience, Hart made a conscious decision to make an album void of the pressures of conflict in the studio and focus on enjoyment and collaboration. \\"I was convinced that making records should be fun. I loved recording growing up: that‚Äôs what I was looking for ‚Äì and for someone I could produce it with... be collaborative with, experimental\\". Through collaborations with multi- instrumentalist and producer Mark Myers, Hart brought the song ideas from tour into fruition. Recorded over two weeks in September 2011, Hart's debut album Milling in the Wind was crafted in the comfort of Myers' home studio in Cairns. The album, described as folk-inspired finery, features a number of familiar guests including Boy & Bear frontman Dave Hosking, ex-Boy & Bear bandmate Jake Tarasenko, the Middle East's Jordan Ireland, and New Zealand singer-songwriter Luke Thompson.

He served as a governor (beglarbeg) of Azerbaijan during the reign of king Suleiman I (r. 1666‚Äì1694). Biography A scion of the Saakadze family, Bijan was the son of the former sepahsalar (commander-in- chief), Rostam Khan (c. 1588 ‚Äì 1 March 1643), and an uncle of the later sepahsalar and divanbegi (chancellor, chief justice), also named Rostam Khan. He was a namesake to his grandfather. His brother Safiqoli (d. 1679) held influential positions in the Safavid ranks as well. Though Bijan's family had always been amongst the king's favorites according to the Italian traveller Gemelli Careri, Bijan himself had \\"fallen into disgrace\\" during the tenure of the grand vizier Shaykh Ali Khan Zanganeh (1669‚Äì1689). Shaykh Ali Khan had made him \\"suspect\\" with king Suleiman I, by claiming that he was a \\"madman\\" and a \\"drunkard\\". Careri adds that it was only through the mediation of his powerful nephew Rostam Khan, that the king could finally be convinced of his sanity.

It derives its name from the Gaelic choil beath, which means \\"wood of birches\\", and began as a colliery village. In the summer of 1789, a coal pit was sunk at Halbeath, two and a half miles northeast of Dunfermline, and by 1821, 841 people were reported to be living in the village.Pitcairn 2000, p.443 Education A school was built in Halbeath in 1875 under the School Board of the Parish of Dunfermline but was closed in 1966.Pitcairn 2000, p.444 A new primary school, Carnegie Primary, opened in Halbeath in August 2011. It was previously a virtual school which shared its campus with Inverkeithing Primary School. Lauder Technical College was founded by Andrew Carnegie's uncle, George Lauder, Sr., father of George Lauder, Andrew's cousin and business partner, in 1899. The original campus was situated in the centre of Dunfermline before moving to Halbeath in 1970. The name was changed to Carnegie College in 2007. Carnegie College came together with Adam Smith College in August 2013 to form Fife College. There is also a Busy Bees nursery on the Carnegie College campus. Transport The A92 road was extended in 1997, linking the roundabout at Carnegie College to the M90 motorway. This removed 22,000 vehicles a day from Main Street and Sandybank, the two busiest streets in Halbeath and greatly reduced congestion in the village.Pitcairn 2000, p.446 Construction of the Halbeath Park & Ride started in late 2012 and opened on 25 November 2013. The construction was funded by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund. The aims were to reduce congestion problems during the construction of the Queensferry Crossing, to provide alternative routes to Edinburgh and Glasgow and to reduce traffic in Dunfermline town centre. There have been calls to build a new railway station at the Park & Ride with the same aims as the Park & Ride.

Built in 1915, it was the first highway crossing of the lower Colorado and is the earliest example of a through truss bridge in Arizona. It is also the only example of a Pennsylvania truss within Arizona. Originally the bridge carried the transcontinental Ocean-to-Ocean Highway and later carried its successor, US 80 until a new bridge was built to the west in 1956. Between 1988 and 2001, the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic and only traversable by pedestrians and bicyclists. After a major restoration, the bridge was rehabilitated and reopened to vehicular traffic in 2002, with a re- dedication by the Quechan nation and Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. The bridge became part of Historic US 80 in 2018. History In 1913, following massive pressure against Arizona Congressman Carl Hayden by the citizens of Yuma, Hayden lobbied Congress, proposing federal aid be used for construction of a permanent highway crossing spanning the lower Colorado River. Congress authorized the construction of the bridge under the pretense that it was to be used in connecting Yuma to the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation located on the opposing bank of the river. It was therefore, the federal funding would be provided through the Office of Indian Affairs (OIA). Further capital was raised and provided by the State of Arizona and Imperial County, California; each providing $25,000. OIA engineers in Washington D.C. were tasked with designing the new bridge. The new bridge design was to be a steel, Pennsylvania through truss design complemented by a Warren deck truss second span, both resting upon concrete piers and abutments above the river. The location of the bridge was to be upstream from an existing ferry crossing at Prison Hill Road. The Omaha Structural Steel Works was awarded the construction contract by the OIA in June 1914, at a cost of $73,800. Construction on the bridge began in September 1914. Between October and February, problems arose constructing the bridge, as both Omaha Steel and the OIA were unfamiliar with the currents and flood patterns of the lower Colorado. Falsework erected to aid in the bridge's construction were twice washed downstream by floods. Omaha Steel decided to approach construction of the twin span bridge by a different method; constructing the spans on barges and floating each span down river into position. The span was floated down river and swung into place carefully and methodically on March 3, 1915, followed by local praise and celebration. Following completion, the Ocean-to- Ocean Bridge was ceremoniously opened to the public on May 22, 1915. The bridge became a crucial link in the nationwide transcontinental Ocean-to-Ocean Highway and was also the first highway bridge across the lower Colorado River. On November 11, 1926, the bridge became part of U.S. Route 80. The successor to the earlier Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, US 80 became the primary east to west transcontinental highway in Arizona and between the 1920s and 1930s, carried the majority of the state's auto traffic. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was used by California state police officers to deny entry refugees of the dust bowl hailing from Oklahoma intending to find work in California. Often called \\"Okies\\", these people found work instead around Yuma, County between Yuma and Wellton. The refugees soon provided critically needed assistance to local farmers. In 1956, US 80 was re-routed off the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge and onto a newer bridge built downstream at the foot of Fourth Avenue. Following construction of the Fourth Avenue Bridge and the construction of Interstate 8 in the early 1970s, vehicular traffic and importance of the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge steadily declined. Similarly, the historic transcontinental highway which the bridge had once carried, US 80, declined and was removed from San Diego to Benson between 1964 and 1977, no longer running through Yuma. In 1978, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Despite the newly gained honor, vehicular traffic was no longer allowed to use the bridge after 1988. In 2001, a $3 million restoration and rehabilitation project was begun, temporarily closing the bridge to pedestrians as well. Following the extensive restoration and a re- dedication ceremony, the bridge was re-opened to traffic in 2002 and now carries Penitentiary Avenue. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was designated as part of Historic U.S. Route 80 by the Arizona Department of Transportation on September 21, 2018.

Another brother, Jesus Lava, took over after Jose's arrest in 1950. In 1948, the PKP began a violent insurrection against the government. The party was banned that year. In early 1950, the PKP created the People's Liberation Army (Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan), which was made up of about 10,000 soldiers. On 18 Oct. 1950, the entire secretariat of the Central Committee of the PKP was arrested, including General Secretary Jose Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila. In May 1951 Jose Lava was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released from prison in January 1970. After that, he left the Philippines to exile himself in Prague. He lived in Czechoslovakia for 20 years till 1990. He has written works on the Communist movement in the Philippines there. After the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989, Jose Lava returned to the Philippines in 1990 and died there in 2000.

Early life Ryan was born in London, United Kingdom around 1851. She married William Ryan on 13 November 1867 in Canowie, South Australia, when she was 16. Life in the Northern Territory Victoria Hotel, Palmerston, Northern Territory Ryan and her husband moved to the Northern Territory from Adelaide in 1873 after hearing reports of gold discoveries in the north. She arrived in Darwin, then known as Palmerston, on board the Birchgrove just three years after the town was established by George Goyder. The couple travelled straight to the gold fields near Pine Creek with hundreds of other prospectors. Upon realising that 'liquid gold' was also a lucrative opportunity, the Ryans leased the Miners' Arms Hotel. Over the next 15 years, Ryan earned the reputation of keeping the \\"best table out of Darwin\\". Ryan separated from her husband in 1877 taking out a formal protection order against him in 1881 for her earnings, \\"owing to his threats, cruelty and drunkenness\\". She granted him ¬£50 and he left Palmerston shortly after stating he had \\"had quite enough of the Territory and the people in it\\". After the divorce, Ryan consolidated her holdings, buying up land in Palmerston and taking on several mining leases. As the economy cooled, Ryan decided to build a hotel in 1888. Her plans were stalled after sustaining a serious injury falling from her horse, which kicked her in the head. But two years later she succeeded in building a prestigious two-storey hotel in Palmerston which was first named the Royal, but was changed to the North Australian at the last minute. It was eventually named the Victoria Hotel. It opened in 1890 to wide acclaim: > \\"It only remains to be said that the interior arrangements are of the very > best the furnishings of the bedrooms and parlours are both elaborate and > tasteful.\\" She was a sporting enthusiast and owned several racehorses, securing much business for her hotel. She was known to take unpopular position on issues in the town, such as campaigning against the restriction of Chinese immigrants. She had depended on Chinese labour for the construction of and domestic work in her hotel. Also in 1890, Ryan also applied for a lease to run the Union Hotel, at a mining lease called the Union, in the same year. In 1896 Ryan relinquished her lease on the North Australian taking out one instead on the nearby Club Hotel, located on the site of the Hotel Darwin. Both pubs were severely damaged in the 1897 cyclone the following year. Ryan took up the management of the North Australia Hotel, known at this stage as the Victoria Hotel, again in 1901, returning the hotel to the centre of social life in Darwin by establishing a dressmaker adjacent to the hotel and through the hosting of motor launches. The Victoria Hotel was taken under Federal control in 1915, after the Northern Territory separated from South Australia and was transferred to the Commonwealth, in an attempt to control alcohol consumption in the town. Later life Ryan retired to Adelaide where she lived with her sister. She remained embroiled in a compensation claim over the 'state' takeover of the Victoria Hotel until her death on 30 May 1920. Ryan is buried in West Terrace Cemetery. When the hotel was being renovated in 1988, two stones were discovered hidden in a wall's hollow cavity. One featured a sketch of Ellen Ryan, the other was a poem allegedly penned by a \\"disappointed former lover\\". It said in part: > She promised she would seek me here > If death was as she thought > Sometimes, less drunk, I think I see > Her lovely ghost form beckon me > Or could it be the liquor has me caught? > > At the Vic Hotel in Darwin Town > They'll all be drinking still > Not knowing that her face lies hid > May it haunt them as for me it did > Oh God!

They are distinctively wrapped in corn husks and are commonly sold as pasalubong and street food in Northern Mindanao and Cebu. It is sometimes anglicized as \\"steamed corn cakes\\". Description Binaki and pintos are sweet variants of Philippine tamales without fillings. They arose independently in Bukidnon and Bogo. Both are traditionally wrapped in corn husks, but can usually be distinguished from each other by the method of wrapping. Binaki has a longer and narrower wrapping, while pintos is shorter and rectangular with additional cross-wise ties.

However, and pintos are closer to the South American humita and Central American tamal de elote. Binaki and pintos are prepared identically. They are made by scraping young corn ears on a grater. The resulting coarse cornmeal is then mixed with milk, butter (or margarine), baking powder, and white or brown sugar. In lieu of milk and sugar, condensed milk may sometimes be used. Cheese may also be added. The mixture is then scooped and wrapped in corn husk before being steamed until firm. Variants A variant among the Maranao people derived from the Bukidnon is . However, it has diverged greatly and is generally considered a separate dish. It uses grated cassava primarily, with only bits of grated young corn kernels mixed in.

The Philippines and Peru are both predominantly Roman Catholic countries and were ruled by the Spanish Empire for hundreds of years. Trade relations During the colonial period, there was significant trade between the two colonies. But there were frequent shifts and reversals of the trade volumes. Following the Spanish conquest of the Philippines in 1560, the islands became a focal point of trans-Pacific trade between Peru and China. Large quantities of silver was exported from Peru, whilst luxury goods such as silk was imported from China via the Philippines. However, in 1581 the Spanish crown awarded monopoly to the port of Acapulco for the trade over the Pacific. However, the traders of Peru continued to trade with the Philippines, in violation of the Royal Decree. Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe√±alosa, the governor- general of the Philippines, sent galleons to Peru in 1581 and 1582 carrying the message that trade with Manila was illegal. The smuggling of Chinese goods to Peru involved both Peruvian merchants and politicians. As of the early 17th century, there were significant imports of Chinese goods to the cities of Lima and Potos√≠. The peak year was 1602, when the imports from Asia was estimated at a value of 5 million pesos. In 1793 the Philippines Company was given permission to resume exports to Peru. Later years In 2008, Former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Former Peruvian President Alan Garc√≠a held bilateral talks and shared commonalities talking about the kinship between their two countries. Following on the meeting of the two Presidents, it was announced in 2008 that the re-introduction of the Spanish language in Philippine schools in 2009 would be a very timely move as the Philippines and Peru had agreed to expand their diplomatic, bilateral and trade relations.

Diversity and inclusion in policing Diversity in service and the elimination of discrimination across the planet is led by many individuals, staff, associations and others within the global police community.

In a career spanning more than 30 years his photographs have appeared in local and international magazines, newspapers, and album covers. Mott is recognised as Australia's premier rock photographer and a leading worldwide exponent of the craft.  Early life  Tony Mott was born Anthony Moulds in April 1956, child of Brian and Mary Moulds, and raised in Sheffield, England. He was a student at Jordanthorpre Comprehensive secondary school, and trained as a chef at Sheffield Polytechnic before arriving in Australia in 1976.  Chef's career  Mott trained as a French and pastry chef and spent 10 years working in hotels in the United Kingdom and in Australia. He worked for six months as a chef in Sydney at the Opera House and at the Gazebo Hotel in Kings Cross in 1976, before helping establish a restaurant in Armidale, New South Wales. Mott then returned to England because of a limited working visa. Mott then worked as a chef aboard the cruise ship SS Oriana for two years, visiting more than 60 countries and developing an interest in travel and photography. Returning to Sydney, he decided to settle in Australia permanently in 1981. Whilst resuming work as a chef at the Gazebo Hotel in Kings Cross, Mott pursued his love of music, exploring Sydney's live music scene in the evenings.  Photography career  Mott's interest in photography began in Sheffield, where he learnt basic black-and-white developing skills and explored an interest in social documentary photography whilst working as a chef. Pennie Smith, a London-based photographer who worked for music magazine NME, was an early influence. =Sydney's live music scene= Mott's career as a rock photographer began in 1983 at the Piccadilly Hotel in Kings Cross. Mott went to see the Sydney band the Divinyls on Monday nights at the hotel and began photographing the band's lead singer Chrissy Amphlett. Band manager Vince Lovegrove chose one of Mott's photographs as a tour poster and from 1983 bands began approaching Mott to shoot their gigs. Mott went on to document the Sydney music scene of the 1980s and 1990s when the city and suburbs were full of live venues and had a flourishing record industry. = Street press and magazines = Shortly after his first break with the Divinyls, Mott found work through the free Sydney paper On the Street, working closely with editor Margaret Cott, later publisher of Drum Media. Mott was given a free rein to develop his skills as a rock 'n roll photographer with many bands. His photographs began to appear in mainstream music magazines Juice, Drum Media, RAM, Juke, Creem, and Rolling Stone. Mott's success is reflected in the number of magazine covers featuring his photographs. Since his first cover for the German issue of Rolling Stone magazine in the early 1990s, his work has been featured on the cover of Rolling Stone 14 times. His photographs have appeared on an estimated 900 magazine front covers. At the height of Mott's career he was estimated to have 172 music magazines on his books, and could sell one concert photograph to 30 magazines at a time. Today 162 of those magazine titles no longer exist. These trends mirror changes in the record industry, which in Sydney had 12 major labels in the early 1980s, down to about three in 2015. The shrinking magazine market has seen Mott's income from this source shrink to an estimated 10%, with 10% from record companies, and the rest from band commissions. Album covers on display. Exhibition: \\"What a Life!\\" State Library of NSW From the 1990s Mott's photographs were also featured on album covers. Notable early covers included Tommy Emmanuel's Dare to Be Different and the Beasts of Bourbon's Black Milk. = International music scene = Mott's first international portrait featured the Eurythmics. Then in 1988 Mick Jagger was touring Australia to promote his first solo album and Mott was hired as Jagger's tour photographer. This subsequently led to Mott being hired by the Rolling Stones and touring with them on three occasions. In the same year that Mott was hired by Jagger, he toured with Bob Dylan and Fleetwood Mac, establishing an international reputation. Mott has photographed a large number of the international acts to have visited Australia. Mott's portfolio includes the most popular names in music, including the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Elton John, Nirvana, and Madonna, along with major Australian acts INXS, Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, Silverchair, and the independent Sydney band scene. Mott's portraits have become the best known images of many musicians and bands; examples include Chrissy Amplett of the Divinyls at the Piccadilly Hotel, Kings Cross, 1983; the classic shot of Peter Garrett at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in 1985; the much published portrait of Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk at the Big Day Out, 1994; the defining shot of Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten (Lydon) at the Hordern Pavilion, Sydney, 1994; and the dynamic portraits of Kylie Minogue and Nick Cave who sang the duet \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\", 1996. = Music festivals = Music festivals were another fertile source of photographs for Mott from the late 1980s. Initially he visited the summer festivals in Europe and the United States. Milton Keynes, Reading, and Glastonbury were among the popular UK festivals. A major breakthrough for Mott came in 1992 with the establishment of Australia's first Rock 'n Roll Festival, the Big Day Out. Each year Mott went on the road as the Festival toured Australia. Developing relationships with the bands he shot, he became the festival's official photographer. = Digital photography = The advent of digital technology has seen a decline in the demand for rock 'n roll photographs as fans at venues have their own digital cameras and mobile phones. Mott sold 28 images internationally of band Red Hot Chili Peppers when he photographed them in 2000, compared to selling only three images in 2013. Mott finally switched to a digital camera in 2008 after Nikon presented him with a D3 camera. After using it at a Judas Priest concert, he discovered it was well suited to live music, achieving dozens of good images, where film may have produced only a few. = Film = Mott's introduction to film came as a stills photographer with Paul Goldman's feature film Suburban Mayhem (2007). A number of films have followed. * Cactus (2008) * Animal Kingdom (2010) * Tomorrow When the War Began (2010) * A Few Best Men (2011) * The Darkside (2013) * The Rover (2014) As of 2015 a large percentage of Mott's income comes from stills on television and film productions. This has coincided with the advent of digital photography and other changes in the music industry including a decline in live music and drop in music magazine production. = Exhibitions = * 2015 (17 October ‚Äì 7 February) \\"What a Life!

History The constitutional requirement for the public defender system at all levels of government was established in 1963 by Gideon v. Wainwright. The Missouri State Public Defender System was established in 1972. By 1973, there were 14 public defender offices in the state of Missouri. In 1976, the Public Defender Commission was created to appoint full-time public defenders to four-year terms and to oversee the system. Legal representation was provided for felony, juvenile, and misdemeanor cases when the offense charged could result in jail time. By 1977, the total number of public defender offices had reached 18. In 1982, a house bill amended the system with the creation of the Office of State Public Defender (OSPD) as an independent department of the judicial branch of state government. By 1987, 23 public defender offices existed and employed 233 people. The remainder of the state was served by contracts with private attorneys. At that time, the system provided representation in more than 41,000 cases annually. =Public Defender System funding crisis= On August 2, 2016, Michael Barrett, who was then serving as director of the Missouri State Public Defender System, called on then-governor Jay Nixon to act as a public defender in a criminal assault case. Nixon's communications director, Scott Holste, questioned the authority of Barrett to do so. The appointment follows a July 2016 legal action in which Barrett et al. challenge the constitutionality of restricting funds for indigent defense. On December 26, 2017, Judge Victor Howard ruled that \\"because the public defender does not exercise judicial power, a withholding of expenditures to it by the governor (the executive) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.\\" In an open letter to Nixon, Barrett cites Missouri Revised Statues Section 600.042.5(1) as well as the 6th and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution as reason for the controversial action. Barrett blames Nixon for the underfunding and understaffing of the public defender system and chose to appoint him because he is \\"the one attorney in the state who not only created the problem, but is in a unique position to address it.\\" According to Barrett, the funding for \\"resources that assist with delivering legal services\\" have increased between 5 and 6% since 2009, while costs over the same period have increased 18%. The case load has increased over 12% in the past year. According to a 2008 report by the National Legal Aid & Defender Association, Missouri ranks 49th in per capita legal aid spending. Ruth Petsch, Jackson County Missouri‚Äôs chief public defender, cites the lack funding for inadequate defense and 9 to 12 month delays in adjudication for indigent persons who often remain in jail and are unable to maintain active employment during that time.

The Wellington High Court ruled against the National Party, ordering them to pay over $600,000 for copyright infringement. This was partially overturned by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, which reduced the damages to $225,000. Background On 16 September 2016, Eminem's publishers filed a lawsuit with the High Court in Wellington, claiming that the National Party, its advertising agency and others involved in creating and licensing the track had made a copyright infringement from using an instrumental version of the song \\"Lose Yourself\\" in television advertisements without their consent. Their campaign manager Steven Joyce stated their using of the song was \\"pretty legal\\", claiming it had been purchased from an Australian music library. The publishers counter-claimed that they never allowed the song to be used in a political advert. They have persisted with the lawsuit and a trial began at the Wellington High Court on 1 May 2017. The case concluded on 12 May 2017; Justice Helen Cull reserved her decision.It's a rap: Eminem lawsuit against New Zealand party ends New Zealand Herald, 12 May 2017 On 25 October, the High Court ruled that the National Party and its co defendants ( Stan3 Ltd, Sale St Studios Ltd, Amcos NZ Ltd, Australasian Mechanical Copywright Owners Society Ltd, Beatbox Music Pty Ltd, Labrador Entertainment Inc and the sound alike musics creator Michael Alan Cohen ) had breached copyright and ordered them to pay $600,000 plus interest. Aftermath Eight Mile Style spokesman Joel Martin said the company was happy with the result following a \\"distasteful\\" trial for them, while National Party president Peter Goodfellow said the party was disappointed with the final verdict and would proceed themselves to pursue legal action against Labrador and Beatbox, who supplied them the music. Eminem told Variety that he was not consulted about the case, but should he receive any money from it he would donate it to charity for the Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. Musician and former APRA director Mike Chunn said that sound-alike recordings are routinely used in advertising and that the ruling was unfair. The National Party appealed the ruling on grounds that copyright wasn't breached and if it was, the damages should have been lower. There was a cross-appeal from US companies Eight Mile Style and Martin Affiliated sought to have the damages to be increased. The Court of Appeal of New Zealand upheld the National Party's appeal on damages only and reduced the amount of the damages to $225,000.National Party v Eight Mile Style - damages reduced, Scoop, 18 December 2018 Subsequently, Eight Mile Style sought leave to appeal the appeal decision in the Supreme Court in May 2019.

It premiered at the Mardi Gras Film Festival on February 15, 2018 and was released in the United States on June 29, 2018. Plot Erasmus (Coogan) and Paul (Rudd) are a gay couple whose life is turned inside out when a ten-year-old boy, Bill, shows up at their door claiming to be Erasmus's grandson. Erasmus is a famous chef and Paul is the producer of his cooking show, and they live in a large showplace house in New Mexico. Bill's father, Beau, was the result of a one-time heterosexual encounter, and Erasmus has never met him or Bill. Beau has been jailed on drug charges and instructed Bill to find his grandfather. Erasmus and Paul come to embrace parenthood, although Paul does most of the heavy lifting. Beau attempts to get clean in jail, and tells Erasmus and Paul that he plans to take Bill out of state once he is released. When Bill says he would rather stay with the couple, Erasmus consults a lawyer. He is told that it's unlikely he'll get custody unless Bill is in immediate danger from his father. Erasmus and Paul try to enjoy the holidays with Bill and the time they have left with him. After Beau shows up to take Bill, Erasmus invites him in hoping to change his mind; later that night, Beau takes Bill and leaves without saying goodbye. Erasmus and Paul's relationship has been strained, and Paul tells Erasmus that he plans to take a job with Rachael Ray's show in New York. Erasmus seems indifferent at first but jumps in front of Paul's car and begs him to stay. Paul goes as far as the airport, but turns back and they reconcile. Beau gets into a drunk-driving accident with Bill in the car, and Erasmus and Paul are awarded custody.

He is known as Richard Read senior to differentiate him from another Richard Read, thought to be his son, who painted in Sydney at the same time.  Early life  Little is known of Richard Read's early life. Richard Read is said to have been born in London circa 1765. Recent sources suggest that his middle name was Daniel and that his parents were Richard Read and Lydia, n√©e Ames. London business directories for 1805 and 1808 show Read as an animal painter. In July 1812 he was sentenced to fourteen years‚Äô transportation for knowingly possessing forged banknotes. He was transported to Sydney on the Earl Spencer, arriving in Sydney on 9 October 1813. Just eight weeks later, Read received his ticket of leave. Sarah and their daughter Elizabeth Lydia arrived on the ship Kangaroo in January 1814. His son, also named Richard and later a noted painter himself, arrived in Sydney as a free settler in 1819. The younger Richard Read was already estranged from his father, and did not acknowledge their relationship.  Career  Elizabeth Broughton, 1812, National Library of Australia Read established a drawing school at 37 Pitt Street, Sydney, in 1814. There he taught the art of drawing, and also sold his own drawings, embroideries and paintings. Two Read paintings survive from this time: Portrait of John Buckland and Portrait of Elizabeth Isabella Broughton. Though Read claimed to have been taught by the noted British artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, no evidence has been found for this claim. He benefited from the patronage of New South Wales governor Lachlan Macquarie. Read advertised in the Sydney Gazette in 1823, saying that he had recently completed a number of portraits of Macquarie. A watercolour portrait of Macquarie acquired by the State Library of New South Wales is thought to be one of these. On the reverse, the portrait is labelled 'Take notice that none are original pictures of Governor Macquarie but what has got the name of Read marked in Latin with the seal annext Governor Macquarie never sat to any artist in this colony but Read Snr.' Read continued to operate at several studios in Sydney before receiving an absolute pardon in July 1826. Shortly thereafter, no further trace is found of Read. As he is not listed in the 1828 census of new South Wales, it is possible that he returned to England.  Legacy  Read painted portraits of notable Sydney identities including the Macquarie family, Barron Field and Elizabeth Marsden, wife of Samuel Marsden. These, along with several of Read's Sydney landscapes and paintings of birds and animals, are located at the State Library of New South Wales.

Indigenous people found in Africa, the Arctic, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Latin America, North America and the Pacific have strategies and traditional knowledge to adapt to climate change. These knowledge systems can be beneficial for their own adaptation to climate change as well as applicable to non-indigenous people. The majority of the world‚Äôs biological, ecological, and cultural diversity is located within Indigenous territories. There are over 370 million indigenous peoples found across 90+ countries. Approximately 22% of the planet's land is indigenous territories, varying slightly depending on how indigeneity and land usage is determined. Indigenous people have the important role of the main knowledge keepers within their communities, including knowledge relating to the maintenance of social-ecological systems. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People recognizes that Indigenous people have specific knowledge, traditional practices, and cultural customs that can contribute to the proper and sustainable management of ecological resources. Indigenous Peoples have a myriad of experiences with the effects of climate change because of the varying geographical areas they inhabit across the globe and because of the differences in cultures and livelihoods. Indigenous Peoples have a wide variety of experiences that Western science is beginning to include in its research of climate change and its potential solutions. The concepts of ancestral knowledge and traditional practices are increasingly respected and considered in Western scientific research.  Disproportionate impact of climate change on Indigenous Peoples  Reports show that millions of people across the world will have to relocate due to rising seas, floods, droughts, and storms. While this will affect people all over the world, the impact will disproportionately affect Indigenous people.Kapua'ala Sproat, D. \\"An Indigenous People‚Äôs Right to Environmental Self-Determination: Native Hawaiians and the Struggle Against Climate Change Devastation.\\" Stanford Environmental Law Journal 35, no. 2. Indigenous people will be more impacted by climate change for multiple reasons. Many Indigenous cultures and lifestyles are linked directly to the environment, therefore the health of the environment in which they live is extremely important for their physical and spiritual wellbeing. Changing climates that alter the environment will have greater effects on people who depend on the environment directly, both spiritually and physically. While beliefs that Indigenous people will suffer more because of their deep connection to the land are true in many cases, the increased negative effects of climate change are also directly related to oppression and poverty caused by colonialism. > Indigenous peoples and communities globally have experienced a series of > traumatic invasions that have had long-lasting and disastrous outcomes. > Massacres, genocidal policies, disease pandemics, forced removal and > relocation, Indian boarding school assimilation policies, and prohibition of > spiritual and cultural practices have produced a history of ethnic and > cultural genocide. Indigenous communities across the globe generally have economic disadvantages that are not are prevalent in non-indigenous communities due to the long term oppression they have experienced. These disadvantages such as lower education levels, higher rates of poverty and unemployment add to their vulnerability to climate change. Many studies suggests that Indigenous peoples have strong ability to adapt when it comes to the environmental changes caused by climate change, and there are many instances in which Indigenous people are adapting. Their adaptability lies in the traditional knowledge within their cultures, which through \\"traumatic invasions\\" have been lost. The loss of traditional knowledge and oppression that Indigenous people face pose a greater threat than the changing of the environment itself. Africa Farm tools from Malawi, where researchers studied Indigenous agriculture techniques. Climate change in Africa will lead to food insecurity, displacement of Indigenous persons, as well as increased famine, drought, and floods. In some regions of Africa, like Malawi, climate change can also lead to landslides, hailstorms, and mudslides.Nkomwa, Emmanuel Charles, Miriam Kalanda Joshua, Cosmo Ngongondo, Maurice Monjerezi, and Felistus Chipungu. \\"Assessing Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Agriculture: A Case Study of Chagaka Village, Chikhwawa, Southern Malawi.\\" Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C 67-69 (2014): 164-72. . Pressure from climate change on Africa is amplified because disaster management infrastructure is nonexistent or severely inadequate throughout the continent. Furthermore, the impact of climate change in Africa falls disproportionately on Indigenous people because they have limitations on their migration and mobility, are more negatively affected by decreased biodiversity, and have their agricultural land disproportionately degraded by climate change. In Malawi, there has been a decrease in yield per unit hectare due to prolonged droughts and inadequate rainfall. The northernmost and southernmost countries within the continent of Africa are considered subtropical. Drought is one of the most significant threats posed by climate change to subtropical regions. Drought leads to subsequent issues regarding the agricultural sector which has significant effects on the livelihoods of populations within those areas. Pastoralists throughout the continent have coped with the aridity of the land through the adoption of a nomadic lifestyle to find different sources of water for their livestock. Arctic Arctic temperature warming Climate change is having the most dramatic impact on the Arctic with a temperature increase twice the magnitude of the increase in the rest of the world. This is resulting in significant sinking of the ice in the Arctic Sea. Satellite images of the ice show that it currently has the smallest area in recorded history.\\"Report of the Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change.\\" Proceedings of Indigenous People's Global Summit on Climate Change, Alaska, Anchorage. If left unchecked, climate change in the Arctic will lead to a faster rise in sea level, more frequent and increasingly intense storms and winds, further decreases in the extent of sea ice, and increased erosion due to higher waves. This consequence of climate change will have a number of effects on the Inuit people in a variety of ways. Eroding coasts and thinning ice have changed the migration patterns of the numerous animal species such as killer whales, marine polar bears, caribou, and seals. Seals are one of the numerous animals hunted by the Inuit people upon which they depend. The seals are just one of the various species whose population is diminishing due to melting of ice sheets on which they are dependent for raising their young on. Additionally, the rapid melting of the sea ice creates a more hazardous and unpredictable terrain to hunt in, posing a new risk within their subsistence economy. Simultaneously, increased temperatures and melting permafrost will make it harder for Inuit people to freeze and store food in their traditional way. Furthermore, climate change will bring new bacteria and other micro- organisms to the region, which will bring yet unknown effects to the Peoples of the region. One example of the Indigenous groups acting in response to climate change in the Arctic was the Alaska Inter-Tribal Council taking action regarding the decline in the polar bear population that was directly linked to the decline in ice sheets for them to live on. The Alaska Natives rely on polar bears and cohabit with them and through their Indigenous knowledge have contributed to the co-management with the U.S. federal government to increasing and improving conservation efforts regarding the popular megafauna.  Asia  Indigenous people in Asia are plagued with a wide variety of problems due to climate change, including but not limited to, lengthy droughts, floods, irregular seasonal cycles, typhoons and cyclones with unprecedented strength, and highly unpredictable weather. This has led to worsening food and water security, which in turn factor into an increase in water-borne diseases, heat strokes, and malnutrition. Indigenous lifestyles in Asia have been completely uprooted and disrupted due to the above factors, but also due to the increased expansion of mono-culture plantations, hydroelectric dams, and the extraction of uranium on their lands and territories prior to their free and informed consent.  Australia  = Indigenous People of Australia and Climate Change Background =  Aboriginal Australians and Traditional Knowledge  Australian Outback Landscape Indigenous people have always responded and adapted to climate change, including these indigenous people of Australia. Aboriginal Australian people have existed in Australia for thousands of years. Due to this continual habitation, Aboriginal Australians have observed and adapted to climatic and environmental changes for millennium which uniquely positions them to be able to respond to current climate changes. Though these communities have shifted and changed their practices overtime, traditional ecological knowledge exists that can benefit local and indigenous communities today. This knowledge is part of traditional cultural and spiritual practices within these indigenous communities. The practices are directly tied to the unique relationship between Aboriginal Australians and their ecological landscapes. This relationship results in a socio-ecological system of balance between humans and nature Indigenous communities in Australia have specific generational traditional knowledge about weather patterns, environmental changes and climatic changes. These communities have adapted to climate change in the past and have knowledge that Western, non-Indigenous people may be able to utilize to adapt to climate change currently and in the future. Despite having little input in terms of the creation current international and local policies to adapting to climate change, Indigenous people have pushed back on this reality, by trying to be active members in the conversation surrounding climate change including at international meetings. Specifically, Indigenous people of Australia have traditional knowledge to adapt to increased pressures of global environmental change. Though some of this traditional knowledge was not utilized and conceivable lost with the introduction of white settlers in the 18th century but recently communities have begun to revitalize these traditional practices. This traditional knowledge includes language, cultural, spiritual practices, land management.  Indigenous People of Australia Community Responses to Climate Change  Aboriginal Australian women and children, Maloga, N.S.W Indigenous knowledge has been passed down through the generations with the practice of oral tradition. Given the historical relationship between the land and the people and the larger ecosystem Aboriginal Australians choose to stay and adapt in similar ways to their ancestors before them. Aboriginal Australians have observed short and long term environmental changes are keenly aware of weather and climate changes. Recently, elders have begun to be utilized by indigenous and non-indigenous communities to understand traditional knowledge related to land management. This includes seasonal knowledge means indigenous knowledge pertaining to weather, seasonal cycles of plants and animals, and land and landscape management. The seasonal knowledge allows indigenous communities to combat environmental changes and may result in healthier social-ecological systems. Much of traditional landscape and land management includes keeping the diversity of floral and fauna as traditional foodways. Ecological calendars is one traditional framework used by Aboriginal Australian communities. These ecological calendars are way for indigenous communities to organize and communicate traditional ecological knowledge. The ecological calendars includes seasonal weather cycles related to biological, cultural, and spiritual ways of life. Some of these changes include a rise in sea levels, getting hotter and for a longer period of time, and more severe cyclones during the cyclone season. Climate issues include wild fires, heatwaves, floods, cyclones, rising sea-levels, rising temperatures, and erosion. The communities most effected by climate changes are those in the North where Aboriginal Australian people make up 30% of the population. Aboriginal Australian communities located in the coastal north are the most disadvantaged due to social and economic issues and their reliance on traditional land for food, culture, and health. This has begged the question for many community members in these regions, should they move away from this area or remain present. Many Aboriginal Australians live in rural and remote agricultural areas across Australia, especially in the Northern and Southern areas of the continent. There are a variety of different climate impacts on different Aboriginal communities which includes cyclones in the Northern region and flooding in Central Australia which negatively impacts cultural sites and therefore the relationship between indigenous people and the places that hold their traditional knowledge. = Climate Change Threats and Adaptation =  Vulnerability  This vulnerability comes from remote location where indigenous groups live, lower socio-economic status, and reliance of natural systems for economic needs. A protest sign reads \\"Indigenous land management not corporate greed\\" at the Melbourne Climate Strike Many of the economic, political, and social-ecological issues present in indigenous communities are long term effects from colonialism and the continued marginalization of these communities. These issues are aggravated by climate change and environmental changes in their respective regions. Indigenous people are seen as particularly vulnerable to climate change because they already live in poverty, poor housing, poor educational and health services, and other socio-political factors place them at risk for climate change impacts. Indigenous people have been portrayed as victims and as vulnerable populations for many years by the media. Aboriginal Australians believe that they have always been able to adapt to climate changes in their geographic areas. Many communities have argued for more community input into strategies and ways to adapt to climate issues instead of top down approaches to combating issues surrounding environmental change. This includes self- determination and agency when deciding how to respond to climate change including proactive actions. Indigenous people have also commented on the need to maintain their physical and mental well being in order to adapt to climate change which can be helped through the kinship relationships between community members and the land they occupy. In Australia, Aboriginal people have argued that in order for the government to combat climate change, their voices must be included in policy making and governance over traditional land. Much of the government and institutional policies related to climate change and environmental issues in Australia has been done so through a top down approach. Indigenous communities have stated that this limits and ignored Aboriginal Australian voices and approaches. Due to traditional knowledge held by these communities and elders within those communities, traditional ecological knowledge and frameworks are necessary to combat these and a variety of different environmental issues.  Heat and Drought  \\"The Green Wattle Creek bushfire moves towards the Southern Highlands township of Yanderra in Southern Australia as police evacuate residents from Yanderra Road\\" Fires and droughts in Australia, including the Northern regions, occur mostly in savannas because of current environmental changes in the region. The majority of the fire prone areas in the savanna region are owned by Aboriginal Australian communities, the traditional stewards of the land. Aboriginal Australians have traditional landscape management methods including burning and clearing the savanna areas which are the most susceptible to fires. Traditional landscape management declined in the 19th century as western landscape management took over. Today, traditional landscape management has been revitalized by Aboriginal Australians, including elders. This traditional landscape practices include the use of clearing and burning to get rid of old growth. Though the way in which indigenous communities in this region manage the landscape has been banned, Aboriginal Australian communities who use these traditional methods actual help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Impact of Climate Change on Health  Increased temperatures, wildfires, and drought are major issues in regard to the health of Aboriginal Australian communities. Heat poses a major risk to elderly members of communities in the North. This includes issues such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Many of the rural indigenous communities have faced thermal stress and increased issues surrounding access to water resources and ecological landscapes. This impacts the relationship between Aboriginal Australians and biodiversity, as well as impacts social and cultural aspects of society. Aboriginal Australians who live in isolated and remote traditional territories are more sensitive than non-indigenous Australians to changes that effect the ecosystems they are a part of. This is in large part due to the connection that exists between their health (including physical and mental), the health of their land, and the continued practice of traditional cultural customs. Aboriginal Australians have a unique and important relationship with the traditional land of their ancestors. Because of this connection, the dangerous consequences of climate change in Australia has resulted in a decline in health including mental health among an already vulnerable population. In order to combat health disparities among these populations, community based projects and culturally relevant mental and physical health programs are necessary and should include community members when running these programs. Caribbean =Impacts of Climate Change on Indigenous Peoples= The impacts of climate change are taking a disproportionate toll on Indigenous peoples, when Indigenous peoples contribute least to climate change. The main effect of climate change in the Caribbean region is the increased occurrence of extreme weather events. There have been an influx of flash floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, extreme winds, and landslides in the region. These events have led to wide-ranging infrastructural damage to both public and private property for all. For example, Hurricane Ivan inflicted damage totalling 135% of Grenada's GDP to Grenada, setting the country back an estimated ten years in development. The effects of these events are most strongly felt, however, by Indigenous persons, who have been forced to move to the most extreme areas of the country due to the lasting effects that colonialism had on the region. In these extreme regions, extreme weather events are even more pronounced, leading to crop and livestock devastation. Also, in the Caribbean, people have reported erosion of beaches, a reduction in vegetation, a noticeable rise in sea-level, and rivers that are drying up. =Adaptation Strategies= Among changing agricultural practices, it is imperative for Indigenous peoples and inhabitants of these regions to integrate disaster plans, national sustainable development goals and environmental conservation into daily lives. As indigenous lands are constantly under attack, from governments to industries, it is imperative for Indigenous peoples to partner with groups such as the Rainforest Alliance to fight and protest for Indigenous rights. Latin America Amazon Deforestation near Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas =Indigenous Peoples Background= Although some cultures thrive in urban settings like Mexico City or Quito, Indigenous peoples in Latin America populate most of the rural poor areas in countries such as Ecuador, Brazil, Peru and Paraguay. Indigenous people consist of 40 million of the Latin American-Caribbean populations. This makes these populations extremely susceptible to threats of climate change due to socioeconomic, geographic, and political factors. Formal education is limited in these areas which caps contributions of skills to the market economy. Mostly living in the Amazon Rainforest, there are more than 600 ethnographic-linguistic identities living in the Latin American region. This distinction of cultures provides different languages, world-views, and practices that contribute to Indigenous livelihoods. =Impacts of Climate Change on Indigenous Peoples= Humans have impacted climate change through land use, extractive practices, and resource use. Not only have humans exacerbated climate change, our actions are threatening the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples in targeted and susceptible areas. Specifically, extractive industries in the Amazon and the Amazonian Basin are threatening the livelihood of Indigenous persons by land use and exacerbating climate change. These extractive policies were originally implemented without the consent of indigenous people are now being implemented without respect to the rights of indigenous people, specifically in the case of REDD. Not only do deforestation and fragmentation of forests negatively affect the areas and livelihoods of inhabitants, but contributes to the release of more carbon into the atmosphere, as the trees provided as carbon sinks, which exacerbates climate change even more. Thus, deforestation has and will continue to have disproportionate effects on Indigenous people in Latin American tropical forests, including the displacement of these communities from their native lands. Also, in the Amazon Basin where fish are a main resource, precipitation and flooding greatly impact fish reproduction drastically. Likewise, this inconsistency in precipitation and flooding has affected, and decreased the reproduction of fish and turtles in the Amazon River. Furthermore, climate change has altered the patterns of migratory birds and changed the start and end times of wet and dry seasons, further increasing the disorientation of the daily lives of Indigenous people in Latin America. As most of the contributions and the roles of combating climate change, the rights and resources of Indigenous peoples often go unrecognized, these communities face disproportionate and the most negative repercussions of climate change and from conservation programs. Due to the close relationship with nature and Indigenous peoples, they are among the first to face the repercussions of climate change and at a large devastating degree.  Gender Inequality  Indigenous peoples suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change, women even more so. Discrimination and some customary laws hinder political involvement, making numbers for Indigenous women extremely low. Although Indigenous women's involvement still lag behind, countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru have improved their political participation of Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, women often face strenuous physical labor. To reduce harm, improve health of humans and the environment, a nongovernmental organization in Brazil introduced an eco- stove that eliminates the need for heavy fuelwood for energy and to cook. This has empowered Indigenous women in Brazil and surrounding areas as around 53,000 people have the opportunity to live healthier and easier lives. Adaptation Strategies Due to Indigenous peoples' extensive knowledge and ability to predict and interpret weather patterns and conditions, these populations are vital to adaptation and survival of posed climate threats. From hundreds of years experimenting with nature and developing inherently sustainable cultural strategies has allowed Indigenous peoples to pass on their knowledge to future generations. This has made Indigenous peoples crucial to understanding the relationship between nature, people, and conserving the environment. In Latin America and the Caribbean, Indigenous peoples are restructuring and changing agricultural practices in adaptation to climate changes. They are also moving and relocating agriculture activities from drought inflicted areas to areas with more suitable, wetter areas. It is imperative for the Americas and the Caribbean to continue pursuing conservation of the environment as 65% of indigenous land has not been developed intensely.  Policy and Global Action  After the Zapatista movement in Mexico in the Mid-1990s, Indigenous issues were recognized internationally and the start of progress for Indigenous political involvement and recognition. Bearing the best political representation, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela have the largest political representation, Mexico being recognized as having the largest gap in proportion to representation and population. International treaties and goals like the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda have recognized the rights of Indigenous peoples. Women play a crucial role in combating climate change especially in Indigenous culture, and it is imperative to recognize strong leadership and their successes. Despite the threats of climate change, Indigenous women have risen up and pushed for sustainable solutions at local and global scales.  North America  Dakota Access Pipeline holds a sign reading \\"We can't drink oil! #NoDAPL\\" Environmental changes due to climate change that have and will continue to have effects on Indigenous Peoples in North America include temperature increases, precipitation changes, decreased glacier and snow cover, rising sea level, increased floods, droughts and extreme weather. Food and water insecurity, limited access to traditional foods and locations, and increased exposure to infectious diseases are all human dimension impacts that will most likely follow the environmental changes stated above. One in four Native Americans face food insecurity. North American tribes, such as the Inuit, rely on subsistence activities like hunting, fishing, and gathering. 15-22% of the diet in some tribal communities is from a variety of traditional foods. These activities are important to the survival of tribal culture, and to the collective self-determination of a tribe. Indigenous North American diets consist of staple foods like wild rice, shellfish, beans, moose, deer, berries, caribou, walrus, corn, squash, fish, and seal. The effects of climate change‚Äîincluding changes in the quality and availability of freshwater, the changing migratory patterns of staple species, and the increased rarity of native plant species‚Äîhave made it increasingly difficult for tribes to subsist on their traditional diets and participate in their culturally important activities. The traditional diets of indigenous North Americans also provide essential nutrients. In the absence of these essential staples‚Äîand often because the populations reside in ‚Äúfood deserts‚Äù and are subject to poverty‚ÄîNative Americans living on reservations are subject to higher levels of detrimental diet-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. In some Native American counties in the U.S., 20% of children aged 2-5 are obese. The Indigenous populations in the United States and Canada are communities that are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to socioeconomic disadvantages. These environmental changes will have implications on the lifestyle of Indigenous groups which include, but are not limited to, Alaska Natives, Inuit, Dene, and Gwich'in people. There are higher rates of poverty, lower levels of access to education, to housing, and to employment opportunities in indigenous communities than there are in non- indigenous communities within North America. These conditions increase indigenous communities' vulnerability and sensitivity to climate change. These socioeconomic disadvantages not only increase their vulnerability and in some cases exposure, they also limit indigenous groups' capacity to cope with and recover from the harmful effects climate change brings. Some of the solutions proposed for combating climate change in North America like coal pollution mitigation, and GMO foods actually violate the rights of Indigenous Peoples and ignore what is in their best interest in favor of sustaining economic prosperity in the region. Additionally, many tribal communities have already faced the need to relocate or protect against climate change (such as sea level rise), but there is a general lack of funds and dedicated government- supported programs to assist tribal communities in protecting themselves from climate change and resettlement, which can result in the further erosion of indigenous cultures and communities. Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity in the region has severely limited the ability of Native people to adapt to changes in their environment. Such uncertainties and changes in livelihood and even culture, alongside the destruction of culturally significant ecosystems and species, can negatively affect people‚Äôs mental health and ‚Äúsense of place.‚Äù Additionally, increases in temperature threatens cultural practices. Many indigenous ceremonies involve going for days without food or water, which can become health and even life threatening in increasingly hot temperatures. An important topic to consider when looking at the intersection of climate change and Indigenous populations is having an indigenous framework and understanding indigenous knowledge. Because of the direct effect climate change has on the livelihoods of many indigenous peoples and their connection to the land and nature, these communities have developed various indigenous knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge refers to the collective knowledge that has been accumulated and evolved across multiple generations concerning people's relationship to the environment. These knowledge systems are becoming increasingly important within the conversations surrounding climate change because of the long timeline of ecological observations and regional ecological understanding. However, there are dangers which come with sharing them. Traditional knowledge is often a part of an indigenous population's spiritual identity, and misuse of it can lead to disrespect and exploitation of their culture, thus some may be hesitant to share their knowledge. However, an example of the ways indigenous knowledge has been used effectively to understand climate change is the monitoring of the Arctic by Alaska Natives. Their knowledge has been used to monitor changes in animal behavior and weather patterns, as well to develop ways of adapting in a shifting environment. In reaction to the environmental changes within North American tribal communities, movements of Indigenous activism have organized and risen to protest against the injustices enforced upon them. A notable and recent example of Indigenous activism revolves around the #NoDAPL movement. ‚ÄúOn April 1st, tribal citizens of the Standing Rock Lakota Nation, and other Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota citizens founded a spirit camp along the proposed route of the Dakota Access Pipeline‚Äù to object against the installment of an oil pipeline through indigenous land. Another example would be in Northwestern Ontario, where indigenous peoples of Grassy Narrows First Nation have protested against the clear-cut logging in their territory. Fishing tribes in Washington State have protested against overfishing and habitat destruction. Indigenous environmental activism against effects of climate change and forces that facilitate ongoing damaging effects to tribal land, aims to correct their vulnerability and disadvantaged status, while also contributing to the broader discussion of tribal sovereignty. In efforts to promote acknowledgement of Indigenous tribes in accordance with Indigenous environmental activism, Indigenous scientists and organizations, such as the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, have called out the importance of incorporating indigenous sciences into efforts toward sustainability, as indigenous sciences offers understanding of the natural world and human‚Äôs relation to it unlike Western sciences.  Pacific  Cargo arrival at the sinking island of Tuvalu, Mid-Atlantic, east of Papua New Guinea. The region is characterized by low elevation and insular coastlines, making it severely susceptible to the increased sea-level and erosion effects of climate change.UNEP 2014. Emerging issues for Small Island Developing States. Results of the UNEP Foresight Process. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi, Kenya. Entire islands have sunk in the Pacific region due to climate change, dislocating and killing Indigenous persons. Furthermore, the region suffers from continually increasing frequency and severity of cyclones, inundation and intensified tides, and decreased biodiversity due to the destruction of coral reefs and sea ecosystems. This decrease in biodiversity is coupled with a decreased populations of the fish and other sea life the Indigenous people of the region rely upon for food. Indigenous people of the region are also losing many of its food sources, such as sugarcane, yams, taro, and bananas, to climate change as well as seeing a decrease in the amount of drinkable water made available from rainfall. Many Pacific Island nations have a heavy economic reliance upon the tourism industry. Indigenous people are not outside of the economic conditions of a nation, therefore they are impacted by the fluctuations of tourism and how that has been impacted by climate change. Pacific coral reefs are a large tourist attraction and with the acidification and warming of the ocean due to climate change, the coral reefs that many tourists want to see are being bleached leading to a decline in the industry's prosperity. According to Rebecca Tsosie, a professor known for her work in indigenous peoples‚Äô human rights, the effects of the global climate change are especially visible in Pacific region of the world. She cites the Indigenous peoples‚Äô strong and deeply interconnected relationship with their environment. This close relationship brings about a greater need for the Indigenous populations to adapt quickly to the effects of climate change because of how reliant they are upon the environment around them. Climate Action of Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Peoples are working to prevent and combat the effects of climate change in a variety of ways, including through climate activism. Some examples of Indigenous climate activists include Autumn Peltier, from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario and Nina Gualinga from the Kichwa community of Sarayaku in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Autumn Peltier, from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario, has been a driving force in the fight to protect water in Canada‚Äôs Indigenous communities. Peltier is the chief water commissioner for Anishinabek Nation, which advocates for 40 member First Nations in Ontario. At just 15 years old, Peltier is rallying for action to protect Indigenous waters and has become a part of the climate action movement. Nina Gualinga has spent most of her life working to protect the nature and communities of the Ecuadorian Amazon. At 18, she represented Indigenous youth before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, helping to win a landmark case against the Ecuadorian government for allowing oil drilling on Indigenous lands. She now advocates on the international stage for Indigenous rights and a fossil-fuel-free economy. Gualinga recently received the WWF International President‚Äôs Youth Award, which acknowledges outstanding achievements by conservationists under the age of 30. Indigenous communities are also working to combat the impacts of climate change on their communities through community initiatives. For example, Inuit community members of Rigolet, Nunastavit in Labrador are working to combat feelings of cultural disconnect through organizing the teaching of traditional skills in community classes, allowing people to feel more connected with their culture and each other. Additionally, Rigolet community members worked with researchers from Guelph University, to develop an app that allows community members to share their findings regarding the safety of local sea ice, as a way to reduce the anxiety surrounding the uncertainty of environmental conditions. Community members have identified these resources as valuable tools in coping with the ecological grief they feel as a result of climate change. Additionally, Indigenous communities and groups are working with governmental programs to adapt to the impacts climate change is having on their communities. An example of such a governmental program is the Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program (CCHAP) within the First Nations Inuit Health Branch of Indigenous Services Canada. The Selkirk First Nation worked with the CCHAP to undertake a project that focused on the relationship between the land, water and the people who rely on the fish camps for food security and to continue cultural practices that support the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well- being of their people. The Confederacy of Mainland Mi‚Äôkmaq‚Äôs Mi‚Äôkmaw Conservation Group in Nova Scotia also worked with the CCHAP on a project involving conducting climate-related research, engaging community members, developing needs assessments and reporting on the state of climate change- related emergency plans. The Indigenous Climate Action (ICA) is also an organization that is the only Indigenous climate justice organization in Canada. They implement \\"tools, education, and capacity needed to ensure Indigenous knowledge is a driving force in climate solutions.\\" Specifically, they held many demonstrations helping Teck withdraw from the Frontier tar sands project.  The benefits of Indigenous participation in climate change research and governance  Historically, Indigenous persons have not been included in conversations about climate change and frameworks for them to participate in research have not existed. For example, Indigenous people in the Ecuadorian rainforest who had suffered a sharp decrease in biodiversity and an increase of greenhouse gas emissions due to the deforestation of the Amazon were not included in the 2005 Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) project.Krause, Torsten, Wain Collen, and Kimberly A. Nicholas. \\"Evaluating Safeguards in a Conservation Incentive Program: Participation, Consent, and Benefit Sharing in Indigenous Communities of the Ecuadorian Amazon.\\" Ecology and Society 18, no. 4 (2013). . This is especially difficult for Indigenous people because many can perceive changes in their local climate, but struggle with giving reasons for their observed change. = Indigenous Knowledge = Critics of the program insist that their participation is necessary not only because they believe that it is necessary for social justice reasons but also because Indigenous groups are better at protecting their forests than national parks. This place-based knowledge rooted in local cultures, Indigenous knowledge (IK), is useful in determining impacts of climate change, especially at the local level where scientific models often fail.Chanza, Nelson, and Anton De Wit. \\"Enhancing Climate Governance through Indigenous Knowledge: Case in Sustainability Science.\\" South African Journal of Science 112, no. 3 (March/April 2016). Furthermore, IK plays a crucial part in the rolling-out of new environmental programs because these programs have a higher participation rate and are more effective when Indigenous Peoples have a say in how the programs themselves are shaped. Within IK there is a subset of knowledge referred to as Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). TEK is the knowledge that Indigenous Peoples have accumulated through the passing of lessons and experiences from generation to generation. TEK is specifically knowledge about the group's relationship with and their classifications of other living beings and the environment around them. = Climate Change and Governance = By extension, governance, especially climate governance, would benefit from an institutional linking to IK because it would hypothetically lead to increased food security. Such a linkage would also foster a shared sense of responsibility for the usage of the environment's natural resources in a way that is in line with sustainable development as a whole, but especially with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, taking governance issues to Indigenous people, those who are most exposed and disproportionately vulnerable to climate issues, would build community resilience and increase local sustainability, which would in turn lead to positive ramifications at higher levels. It is theorized that harnessing the knowledge of Indigenous persons on the local level is the most effective way of moving towards global sustainability. Indigenous communities in Northern Australia have specific generational traditional knowledge about weather patterns and climatic changes. These communities have adapted to climate change in the past and have knowledge that Western, non-Indigenous people can utilize to adapt to climate change in the future. More recently, an increasing number of climate scientists and Indigenous activists advocate for the inclusion of TEK into research regarding climate change policy and adaptation efforts for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) emphasized their support for the inclusion of IK in their Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 ¬∞C saying: > There is medium evidence and high agreement that indigenous knowledge is > critical for adaptation, underpinning adaptive capacity through the > diversity of indigenous agro-ecological and forest management systems, > collective social memory, repository of accumulated experience and social > networks...Many scholars argue that recognition of indigenous rights, > governance systems and laws is central to adaptation, mitigation and > sustainable development.

It was Cal's first victory in five tries against Michigan and its first victory over a Big Ten team since 1952. Cal took the lead with a 44-yard field goal midway through the first quarter. In the second quarter, Michigan took possession at Cal's 33-yard line after a 16-yard punt by Cal's Gary Fowler. Michigan advanced to the one-yard line on two runs by Warren Sipp, and Ron Johnson then scored from the one-yard line. Brian Healy's extra point kick was wide left, and Michigan led, 6‚Äì3. In the fourth quarter, Michigan linebacker Bob Wedge recovered a fumble at Cal's 19-yard line, and Mike Hankwitz kicked a 30-yard field goal to extend the lead to 9‚Äì3 with 6:14 remaining in the game. Cal then scored on a 77-yard bomb from reserve quarterback Randy Humphries to fullback John McGaffie with two minutes remaining and kicked the extra point to take a 10‚Äì9 lead. On the next play from scrimmage, Michigan quarterback Dick Vidmer threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to Jim Berline, but the play was negated on a penalty for backfield in motion. With the crowd noise following Cal's touchdown, halfback Ernest Sharpe had difficulty hearing the signals and went in motion early. After the penalty, Vidmer was intercepted. At the end of the game, Cal players carried their head coach Ray Willsey off the field. Cal out-gained Michigan by a total of 281 yards to 175. Michigan's kickers cost the team seven points, as Brian Healy's extra point kick went wide left in the second quarter, and the Wolverines also missed on field goal attempts of 34 yards (by Frank Titas, wide left in the second quarter) and 26 yards (by Mike Hankwitz).

Encouraged to write by her husband, she was a late representative of Poporanist traditionalism, which she infused with moral themes from Romanian Orthodoxy, and also with echos of modernist literature. Her works of youth, coinciding with World War II, comprise mainly novels centered on the internal conflicts and moral triumphs of provincial women such as herself. Forming a counterpart to her husband's own books, they won praise in their day, but were later criticized for being idyllic and didactic. An anti- communist like her husband, Velisar helped writers and political figures persecuted by the communist regime. She continued to publish, switching mainly to collaborative translation work until the late 1960s, and earned acclaim for her renditions of Russian literature classics. During the same interval, she was left a widow by her husband's death, which occurred at the height of communist pressures on the family; her brother in law PƒÉstorel was imprisoned, as was her friend Dinu Pillat, while others in her circle fled Romania. Returning to more favor in the late 1960s, Velisar lived a mostly quiet life, and eventually withdrew to VƒÉratec Monastery. Her late work comprised a celebrated memoir of her relationship with Teodoreanu, as well as letters she sent to the Pillat family, which were collected in a 2010 book.

Velisar's mother, a former governess, was shunned by Lupa»ôcu, and largely absent from Velisar's life; with her father also away on diplomatic and business trips, she was mostly raised by Romanian relatives. According to stories she later told her friends, »òtefana attended primary school in France.Panait, p. 115 She graduated from the central girls' school in Bucharest, headed by her aunt Maria, wife of the novelist Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea. During the campaigns of World War I, she was in living with her Delavrancea cousins, Cella and Henrieta, in Ia»ôi; it was through them that, ca. 1916, she first met the student and aspiring writer, Ionel Teodoreanu, son of lawyer-politician Osvald Teodoreanu. Constantin Ostap, \\"PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu, reeditat in 2007\\", in Ziarul de Ia»ôi, February 6, 2007 According to her own account, he was instantly attracted to her dark complexion and \\"shiny black eyes\\", but also admired her literary attempts, and encouraged her to continue. By May 1919, verses attesting his love for her appeared in √énsemnƒÉri Literare magazine.Tudor Opri»ô, Istoria debutului literar al scriitorilor rom√¢ni √Æn timpul »ôcolii (1820‚Äì2000), p. 234. Bucharest: Aramis Print, 2002. She married Ionel in 1920, with a ceremony attended by members of the Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ literary circle, including doyen Garabet IbrƒÉileanu‚Äîwho made a point of dancing, something he had never done in his earlier years.NastasƒÉ, pp. 208‚Äì209 She thus became sister in law of the humorist PƒÉstorel, whom she greatly admired, G.

With the Teodoreanu brothers and Sadoveanu, »òtefana was a frequent guest of the Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ salon. Her first published work appeared in 1929, hosted by Tudor Arghezi in Bilete de Papagal magazine; she also contributed to Revista Funda»õiilor Regale and Familia. Her pen name \\"Velisar\\" had been used in her husband's major work, the novel La Medeleni (1925), for a character directly modeled on Lupa»ôcu. »òtefana herself appears in another novel by her husband Bal mascat, published around the time of her debut.Eugenia Mure»ôanu, \\"Vitrina cƒÉr»õii.

It was followed in 1940 by Via»õa cea de toate zilele (\\"Everyday Life\\") and in 1943 by a lyrical sketch-story notebook, Clo»ôca cu pui (\\"Hen and Fledglings\\").Bur»õa-Cernat, p. 61; Panait, pp. 115‚Äì117 Her prose, seen by critics as of quintessentially \\"feminine perfume\\", and even \\"overwhelmingly maternal\\",Bur»õa-Cernat, p. 44 had noted tendencies toward ornamentation and lyricism. In July 1939, modernist reviewer Eugen Lovinescu wrote that her \\"so very tender talent\\" stood apart from other feminine authors emerging at the time: she adhered to neither the \\"psychological eroticism\\" of Cella Serghi and Lucia Demetrius, nor to the \\"most incendiary sensuality\\" of Sorana Gurian.Eugen Lovinescu, \\"Note asupra literaturii noastre feminine\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 7/1939, p. 181 According to researcher Elena Panait, at both a character construction level and in terms of literary message, the works display Velisar's readings from Rabindranath Tagore, Leo Tolstoy, and Ivan Turgenev. She remained a passionate reader of Tagore into old age. Mihail Constantineanu, \\"Sadoveanu √Æn ultimul an de via»õƒÉ‚ÄîNeverosimila vacan»õƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 27/1999 Via»õa cea de toate zilele, written in the first person, shows the muted torment of Baba, a homemaker trapped in a provincial setting, and injured in an accident. The sterility of her life in the t√¢rg ends with Baba's gesture of liberation, a return to the freedom and self- imposed discipline of the countryside.Petru Comarnescu, \\"Note. Via»õa cea de toate zilele, romanul d-nei »òtefana Velisar-Teodoreanu\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 1/1941, pp. 220‚Äì223Panait, pp. 117‚Äì123, 125 This provincial and earthbound note has been read by scholar Aurel Martin as a regionalist ethos, showing Velisar's own cultural attachment to Western Moldavia.Panait, p. 125 Rich in Christian symbols, down to the final scene (featuring an \\"inadvertent\\" sign of the cross), Via»õa cea de toate zilele is seen by Panait as \\"communicating [Velisar's] faith in general human values such as solidarity, tolerance, power of maternal and marital love.\\"Panait, p. 123 That optimistic message is toned down in Clo»ôca cu pui, which includes depictions of women in unresolved despair. Petru Comarnescu, who read Via»õa... as a psychological novel, was impressed by the work, calling it a sample of \\"Romanian gentleness and spiritual greatness\\", \\"vastly different from the literary production of contemporary writers.\\" According to critic Bianca Bur»õa-Cernat, the general tone of these works is \\"idyllic and moralizing\\", \\"involuntary a-temporal\\", and indebted to La Medeleni, as well as to the (Poporanist) traditionalism cultivated by Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ. As Bur»õa-Cernat notes, her relation to Poporanism was through her husband, rather than as a \\"direct participant\\"‚Äîin this, she resembles Profira Sadoveanu, daughter of the writer and herself a novelist.Bur»õa-Cernat, pp. 61‚Äì62. See also Panait, pp. 115‚Äì116 Also focusing on a-temporal elements, Panait sees Velisar's as a \\"retro-modernist\\", in that she applies modern writing techniques to an old literary ideology‚Äî\\"reconditioning outdated literary conventions\\", but with some \\"very timid innovations\\".Panait, pp. 117‚Äì125 She also argues that whole fragments were direct allusions to La Medeleni. At the height of World War II, under the Nazi-aligned Ion Antonescu regime, the Teodoreanus turned to Romanian nationalism. PƒÉstorel was highly visible as the author of anti- communist propaganda, Monica Grosu, \\"Din tainele arhivelor\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 15/2011; Lucian Vasile, \\"Manipularea din presƒÉ √Æn prima lunƒÉ din al doilea rƒÉzboi mondial\\", in Historia, April 2011 while Teodoreanu and his wife wrote texts deploring the destruction of Greater Romania in 1940. Both crossed over official lines in discussing Northern Transylvania, ceded as a result of Nazi pressures: Ionel with novels which made it past official censorship, Velisar with a letter of support for exile magazine Gazeta Transilvaniei.Valeria CƒÉliman, \\"Via»õa »ôi atitudinea Gazetei Transilvaniei √Æn anii de luptƒÉ √Æmpotriva Diktatului de la Viena\\", in Cumidava, Vol. XXI, 1997, pp. 201‚Äì202, 206 =Communist clampdown and translation work= As a novelist, Velisar was published again after the coup of August 1944, with AcasƒÉ (\\"Home\\", 1947).Bur»õa-Cernat, pp. 61‚Äì62; Panait, pp. 116‚Äì117 Also centered on a woman protagonist, it was noted by critic Liana Cozea for its \\"cruelty [...] doubled by understanding and sad compassion\\".Panait, pp. 116‚Äì117 At the time, her marriage to Teodoreanu was becoming strained, as he became known for his sexual escapades, then fell passionately in love with Bessarabian actress Nadia Gray. Gray did not answer to his advances, which caused Teodoreanu to start drinking heavily. Vlaicu B√¢rna, \\"EvocƒÉri: Prin ani »ôi peste ani cu Ionel Teodoreanu\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 32/1996 By then, both Teodoreanus were witnessing with worry the rise of the Romanian Communist Party. Around 1946, their home on Romulus Street was hosting members of the National Liberal Party and other anti-communists, including Mihail FƒÉrcƒÉ»ôanu and their godson, Dinu Pillat; it was the last Romanian domicile of FƒÉrcƒÉ»ôanu and wife Pia before they defected to the West. Velisar and the Delavranceas also aided another defector, the young literary critic Monica Lovinescu, giving her recommendations and credentials to use in Paris.Camelia CrƒÉciun, \\"Monica Lovinescu at Radio Free Europe\\", in John Neubauer, Borb√°la Zsuzsanna T√∂r√∂k (eds.), The Exile and Return of Writers from East-Central Europe: A Compendium, p. 292.

The couple's house was eventually confiscated during the 1947 nationalizations.Ostap (2012), p. 57 A cousin of the Teodoreanus, Alexandru Teodoreanu, was arrested for \\"high treason\\" in 1948. Ionel visited him at Uranus prison, and defended him in court, but Alexandru was sentenced and sent to Aiud.Ostap (2012), pp. 53‚Äì54 The Romanian communist regime allowed Velisar to write, but she was forced to adapt to the new political requirements; her husband, singled out for political elements in his wartime works, was banned by communist censorship.Lazu, p. 71; Ostap, p. 57 Like her marginalized brother in law,Alexandru Ruja, notes to PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu, TƒÉm√¢ie »ôi otravƒÉ, p. 15. Timi»ôoara: Editura de Vest, 1994. she became a translator. In the 1950s, she authored collaborative translations of Russian literature: in 1953, a collection of Russian fairy tales, with Xenia Stroe; in 1955, Alexey Morozov's short prose, with Domnica Curtoglu; in 1955, Oblomov by Ivan Goncharov, with Tatiana Berindei, and other such versions from Tolstoy, Turgenev, and Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak; in 1956, stories by Maxim Gorky, with Ada Steinberg. Harassed by the communist authorities, her husband died unexpectedly during the blizzard of 1954. Velisar was devastated when, after the funeral, she discovered poems of his attesting a lengthy affair with another woman. The funeral was attended by VintilƒÉ Russu-»òirianu and Vlaicu B√¢rna. The latter, who represented the Romanian Writers' Union at the service, later recalled that Velisar and her two sons were living in dignified poverty. VƒÉratec Monastery, where Velisar withdrew into contemplative life In 1957, with Sergiu Dan and Irina Andreescu, Velisar translated from Semen Podyachev. In 1958, she and Sirag CƒÉscanian produced a Romanian version of Aram Ghanalanyan's Armenian folk tales.\\"Bibliografia folclorului rom√Ænesc pe anul 1958\\", in Revista de Folclor, Nr. 3‚Äì4/1960, p. 135 The following year, Velisar completed Anna Karenina (on which she worked with Mihail Sevastos and I. Popovici) and Resurrection (with Ludmila Vidra»ôcu); then returned with versions of Vsevolod Garshin's \\"Four Days\\" (in 1962, again with Xenia Stroe), and Leonid Andreyev's novellas (with Isabella DumbravƒÉ, 1963). In 1959, PƒÉstorel was eventually arrested for his clandestine literature, implicated in the show trial of Constantin Noica (alongside Dinu Pillat), and held for three years at Aiud and Gherla prisons.Ostap (2012), pp. 53‚Äì56; Florina P√Ærjol, \\"Destinul unui formator de gusturi. De la savoarea 'pastilei' gastronomice la gustul fad al compromisului\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 12/2011, pp. 21, 25 =Return and final decades= At the time, Velisar had rekindled her friendship with Sadoveanu, visiting him during the final months of his life. With his widow Valeria and literary historian Zoe Dumitrescu-Bu»ôulenga, Velisar began attending an Orthodox prayer group and literary circle at VƒÉratec Monastery. \\"Revista presei\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 167, May 2003; Grigore Ilisei, \\"Un model de cƒÉrturƒÉrie rom√¢neascƒÉ ‚Äì Zoe Dumitrescu-Bu»ôulenga\\", in Convorbiri Literare, April 2010 It was also there that, in the new climate of d√©tente, she welcomed Pia Pillat, whom the communists allowed to revisit Romania, and her brother Dinu, who had also been released from jail. Released during the amnesty of the 1960s, PƒÉstorel died of cancer just as the censors were allowing him to print a collected works edition. Velisar's work in translation diversified, when she and C. DuhƒÉneanu put out a version of Canaima by R√≥mulo Gallegos (1966). This was followed in 1967 by Sigrid Undset's Kristin Lavransdatter, with Alex. Budi»ôteanu; then, in 1971, by The Kreutzer Sonata, with C. Petrescu and S. Racevski, and Turgenev's First Love‚ÄîSmoke, with Sevastos and M. Cosma; and in 1972 by Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, with DumbravƒÉ. In 1969, Via»õa cea de toate zilele was reissued at the state-run Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, with a preface by Aurel Martin.Panait, pp. 125‚Äì126 Velisar had also begun writing memoirs, which appeared as Ursitul (\\"The Fated One\\", 1970). Republished in 1979, the latter book is described by Bur»õa-Cernat as her best, though still eclipsed by her \\"excellent translations from Russian literature.\\"Bur»õa-Cernat, p. 62 It showed her coming to terms with her \\"fated\\" late husband's philandering, and her vision of him as her one true, ideal, love. Her final novel, CƒÉminul (\\"The Hearth\\"), came out in 1971, followed ten years later by the poetry collection »òoapte √Æntru asfin»õit (\\"Whispers at Sunset\\", 1981). Velisar's final Bucharest residence was a poorly maintained townhouse in Iancului neighborhood.Lazu, pp. 45‚Äì46 As a guest of the Writers' Union, she often wintered at the Mogo»ôoaia Palace, as her home was made uninhabitable by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's cutbacks on heating expenditures; during summers, she often wrote at the Pillats' ancestral home in Izvorani. One of her last contributions to literary history was a Radio Romania broadcast in which she discussed Sadoveanu. In 1980, she also prefaced an edition of Sadoveanu's never-before-printed poems of youth, giving them an enthusiastic reception.

It was built . It was later known as Australian Inland Mission Hospital, AIM Hostel, and Birdsville Nursing Home. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This singled-storeyed sandstone building is thought to have been erected as the Royal Hotel, Birdsville. Although European explorers had passed through the Diamantina district in the 1840s and early 1860s, pastoralists did not occupy this semi-arid region until the mid-1870s when a number of pastoral runs were established. In the early 1880s the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie were established to service the newly taken up pastoral holdings of the Diamantina. Birdsville is reputed to have sprung up around a rough depot constructed by general merchant Matthew Flynn in the late 1870s at the site of the present town. It was then known as the Diamantina Crossing and was on the stock route from Boulia south to Adelaide. By mid-1885, when the township of Birdsville was officially surveyed, a number of buildings had already been erected including a police lock-up (1883), Groth's Royal Hotel (), Blair's Birdsville Hotel (), Curtain's Tattersalls Hotel, and at least 3 stores and a shop. Diamantina Shire was established in 1883, and its headquarters were at Birdsville until moved to Bedourie in 1953. The name Birdsville was not adopted until the 1885 survey, and is thought to have been suggested by Robert Frew, owner of Pandie Pandie Station, who also had a store and shop at the Diamantina Crossing, in reference to the profuse bird life of the district. The township, over west of Brisbane and north of the Queensland-South Australian border, developed as an administrative centre for police and border customs. Nearly all the trade of the town was with Adelaide, and it became an important marshalling point for cattle being driven south to markets in South Australia. By 1889 the population of Birdsville was 110, and the town had 2 general stores, 3 hotels, a police station, school, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 bakers, a cordial manufacturer, bootmaker, saddler, auctioneer & commission agent, and a number of residences. The population peaked in 1895 at 220. Almost all the buildings in the town were of local sandstone, there being no local timber available. Distance and the lack of good access roads or a railway created prohibitively high transportation costs, so imported building materials were kept to a minimum. Architecturally, the old stone buildings of Birdsville reflect the associations of the town with the entire central \\"strip\\" of the Australian continent. Similar buildings are found as far south as Robe in South Australia and as far north as Boulia in Queensland. They are of significance for their illustration of a vernacular style that spread throughout central Australia, across South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. The origin of the style is unknown, but the architectural characteristics are immediately identifiable: built of locally quarried stone with wide verandahs, they efficiently control the extremes of temperature in the hot arid interior of the continent. The earliest section of the Royal Hotel is likely to have been constructed in 1883, as the first license for this hotel was issued to Alfred William Tucker in that year. In 1885 Tucker transferred the license to Johann H Groth, and on the official survey plan of 1885, the building is marked as Groth's hotel. On 25 January 1886, Groth secured his holding by the purchase of the allotment on which the hotel was located, for ¬£260, and the unimproved allotment adjoining this to the south, for ¬£10. Each block comprised 2 roods. Title to both blocks passed from Groth in 1898, but the building continued to function as a hotel under several proprietors and licensees until the early 1920s. Mrs Alice Maude Scott was the licensee and later owner from until at least 1920, when title passed to Harry Afford, station manager of Birdsville. From 1923 to 1937, the Royal Hotel buildings were leased by the Presbyterian Australian Inland Mission (AIM) as their first bush nursing home, or hostel. It was staffed by two nursing sisters, the first two arriving in September 1923. At that time the main building consisted of 6 rooms and was unfurnished. A 1926 photograph shows that parts of two walls of a stone shed at the rear of the hostel had collapsed by this date, and was nicknamed the \\"Hole in the Wall Hospital Store\\". A photograph shows an old shed of corrugated iron also at the rear of the main hostel building. At that period the AIM was headed by the Rev. Dr John Flynn, who was working toward establishing a flying doctor and air ambulance service for remote central Australia. Such a service could only operate efficiently if it could be contacted quickly, so Flynn experimented with radio as a means of communicating between isolated station properties, the Mission's string of bush hostels (ultimately 13), and the flying doctor/air ambulance. In 1925 he undertook various radio experiments throughout central Australia, including an early attempt at receiving/transmitting from the AIM Hostel in Birdsville. However, it was not until 1929, with Alfred Traeger's invention of the pedal radio, that reliable radio communications were possible for the bush. In September 1929, Traeger installed at the AIM's Birdsville Hostel one of 6 experimental \\"transceivers\\" linked to pedal generators, the others being placed at 4 head stations in far western Queensland and at the Aboriginal Mission at Mornington Island, with base station VJI established at Cloncurry. For the first 18 months, communication was by Morse code, but the system proved enormously popular, and soon revolutionised outback communications. Importantly, Birdsville became reliably connected to the station properties in the Diamantina district, and with the new Aerial Medical Service, established by Flynn in 1928 under the auspices of the AIM, and based at Cloncurry. In 1934, nursing sisters Edna McLean and Amy Bishop of the AIM's Birdsville Hostel introduced a system of early morning radio calls to the station women in the Diamantina district who had access to radio. It proved highly popular, and although indecorously dubbed the \\"Galah Session\\", is credited with being Australia's first radio talk-back program. Birdsville VKK became the \\"Voice of the Diamantina Country\\". In 1937 the AIM relinquished the former Royal Hotel premises in Birdsville and moved to a new, purpose-designed hostel (the Australian Inland Mission Hospital, Birdsville) just down the road. The old sandstone building was subsequently used for residential purposes, then abandoned, and later partially collapsed. Some restoration work was carried out in 1984, when sections of the collapsed walls were partly reconstructed. Further substantial stabilisation and restoration work was undertaken in 1994.  Description  The site occupies an area of approximately 0.2 hectares and is located on the southeast corner of Adelaide and Frew Streets in Birdsville. It faces Adelaide Street, the main street in town, along a frontage. The hotel complex was at some period substantially larger than is indicated by the remaining buildings on the site. Remnants of the footings of some earlier stone buildings are in evidence, as is an unusual paving of upturned stoneware bottles. There is also some evidence of footings of timber structures on the site. The remaining building on the site is a single-storeyed, L-shaped stone structure roofed partially with corrugated iron. It has corrugated iron roofed verandahs supported on bush timber posts on the two street elevations. There is some evidence that an earlier verandah was attached to the building face by a timber plate fixed to the stone walling. A false fascia wired to the verandah bressumer shows evidence of original sign writing. On the north fascia this reads: Best Brands - ROYAL HOTEL- Ales, Wines, Spirits, etc. On the west fascia part of the word ROYAL can be deciphered. Despite the collapse of parts of this structure, the original planning and detail remains. It is possible to locate original door and window openings and to determine original finishes, fittings and detail and to deduce the stages in which the building may be been constructed. Walls are laid either as random rubble, or as squared rubble built to courses, both of which use an exceptionally soft mortar. The walls are rendered internally and may also have been rendered externally at some period. To the south of the main building are the remains of footings of a stone building originally attached to the main structure by a covered way. To the east are remnants of a further extension of the large room to the southern wing. At the eastern side of the site are footings of a series of stone cellular structures which may have been an accommodation wing. Closer to the main building is evidence of a more recent small timber and corrugated iron structure, which may have been a bathroom.  Heritage listing  The former Royal Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Royal Hotel at Birdsville, erected , survives as an important link with the earliest pastoral settlement in the Diamantina district of far western Queensland. As the Australian Inland Mission's Nursing Home from 1923 to 1937, it has national significance as the first in a string of such bush hospitals in central Australia and is associated with the earliest outback radio communication and the provision of the Flying Doctor Service. Such medical facilities revolutionised life in remote central Australia in the 1920s and 1930s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Royal Hotel/Australian Inland Mission Hospital is one of only three surviving masonry buildings in Birdsville, the others being the Birdsville Hotel and the police station and courthouse. These contribute significantly to the historic character of the town which, in the last quarter of the 20th century, became a major Queensland tourist attraction. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a vernacular style of masonry construction that spread throughout central Australia, across South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland in the late 19th century, efficiently controlling the extremes of temperature in the hot, arid interior of the continent, and compensating for the lack of locally-available timber. As the former Royal Hotel, the place has the potential, through archaeological and documentary research, to reveal important information about the design, form and function of far western Queensland hotel complexes of this period, and about the people who erected such buildings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. In form and detail it has aesthetic qualities valued by the community and is important in defining the Birdsville townscape.

Life and career =Early years= Downton was born in the village of Bushley in Worcestshire in early 1561, the son of John and Katherine Downton. On the orders of the Earl of Cumberland he took part in the Action of Faial in 1594 as commander of the Samson, which resulted in the destruction of the Portuguese carrack Las Cinco Chagas. Although severely wounded during the action, by 1605 he had recovered and made a trading voyage in the Pilgrim to Cuman√° and other Caribbean ports. Records held at the India Office indicate that Downton and the Earl of Cumberland were the principal shareholders in the venture, and since tobacco was the return cargo, it may be inferred that the Pilgrim returned home via Virginia. =Far east= Early in 1610 he was appointed to command the EIC's ship Peppercorn, and sailed under Sir Henry Middleton in the Trade's Increase on the Company's sixth voyage to the Far East accompanied by the Darling. After touching at the Cape Verde Islands and in Saldanha Bay (now Table Bay), they arrived at Aden on 7 November. They were received with apparent friendliness, and after inquiring into the prospects of trade, Middleton, leaving the Peppercorn at Aden, went on to Mocha, where he anchored on 15 November. After friendly intercourse for some days, on the 28th he was treacherously attacked, taken prisoner, and heavily ironed. The Turks then attempted to seize the ships, but were beaten off with great loss. Nearly at the same time a number of the Peppercorn's men were seized at Aden; and Downton, coming round to Mocha to confer with his general, found himself for the time being in command of the expedition. He remained in the Red Sea, carrying on an occasional correspondence with Middleton, who, on 11 May 1611, succeeded in escaping to the ships. For the next eighteen months they continued, for the most part in the Red Sea or Arabian Sea, visiting the several ports, and seeking to establish a trade; as to which Downton relates that having bought a quantity of pepper at Tecoa on the west coast of Sumatra, on examining it they \\"found much deceit; in some bags were small bags of paddy, in some rice, and in some great stones; also rotten and wet pepper put into new dry sacks.\\" Towards the end of 1612 Middleton went on to Bantam in the Peppercorn, leaving Downton to follow in the Trade's Increase. In doing so the ship struck on an unseen rock, and when got off was found to be leaking badly. Downton returned to Tecoa and had her refitted as well as possible; but on joining Middleton it was decided that the ship could not go home till she had been careened. It was accordingly determined that Downton should take the Peppercorn to England, and he sailed on the homeward voyage on 4 February 1612 (OS) 1613 (N.S.). The voyage was one of difficulty and distress. Within three days after leaving Java Head half the ship's company were down with sickness. \\"He that escapes without disease,\\" Downton wrote, \\"from that stinking stew of the Chinese part of Bantam must be of strong constitution of body.\\" The passage was tedious. Many of his men died, most were smitten with scurvy, he himself was dangerously ill; and the ship, in a very helpless state, unable by foul winds to reach Milford Haven, anchored at Waterford on 13 September 1613, and a month later arrived in the Downs. On 1 January 1614 (N.S.) a new ship of 550 tons was launched for the company, and named the New Year's Gift. Downton was appointed to command her, and to be general of the company's ships in the East Indies. The other ships that would accompany him on his next voyage were the Hector, commanded by Arthur Spaight, the Hope (Matthew Molineux) and the Solomon (Hugh Bennet). Each subsidiary vessel also carried one of the Company's principal factors; William Edwards on the Hector, Nicholas Ensworth (or Emsworth) on the Hope and Thomas Elkington on the Solomon. On 7 March the fleet of four ships put to sea; on 15 June they anchored in Saldanha Bay. Stopping at Socotra, Downton presented the local king with gifts including two fowling pieces, two broadcloth vests, a mirror and 40lb of gunpowder. The fleet arrived at Surat on 15 October where the Portuguese, long determined to resist the advance of the English, were also now at odds with the nawab of Surat. To crush their enemies at one blow the Portuguese collected their whole available force at Goa. It amounted to six large galleons, besides several smaller vessels, and sixty so-called frigates, in reality row-boats, carrying in all 134 guns, and manned by 2,600 Europeans and six thousand natives. In addition to the four ships just arrived with Downton, two of which were small compared with the Portuguese galleons, the English had only three or four country vessels known as galivats, and their men numbered at the outside under six hundred. It was the middle of January 1614‚Äì15 before the Portuguese, having mustered their forces, arrived before Surat. The nawab was terrified and sued for peace. The Viceroy of Goa, Jeronimo de Azevedo, who commanded in person, haughtily refused the submission, and on 20 January the fight began. The English were lying in the Swally, now known as Sutherland Channel, inside a sheltering shoal, which kept the enemy's larger ships at a distance. The Portuguese did not venture to force the northern entrance to the channel, which they must have approached singly, and the attack was thus limited to the smaller vessels and the frigates, which crossed the shoal and swarmed round the Hope, the smallest of Downton's four ships, stationed for her better security at the southern end of the line. Several of them grappled with the Hope and boarded her. After a severe fight their men were beaten back, and, unable to withstand the storm of shot now rained on them, they set fire to their ships and jumped overboard. Numbers had been killed; numbers were drowned; many were burned. The Hope was for a time in great danger; the fire caught her mainsail and spread to her mainmast, which was destroyed; but she succeeded in extinguishing it and in casting off the blazing vessels, when they drifted on to the sands, and burnt harmlessly to the water's edge. During the next three weeks the viceroy made repeated attempts to burn the English ships in the roadstead, sending fireships night after night across the shoal. The English, however, always succeeded in fending them off, and on 13 February the Portuguese withdrew. They had fought with the utmost gallantry, but the position held by the English was too strong for them to force. Their loss in killed, burnt, and drowned was said to amount to nearly five hundred men; that of the English was returned as four slain. This engagement brought Portuguese power on India's western seaboard virtually to an end. The victory enormously increased English influence, and on 25 February the nawab came down to the shore in state, was visited by Downton attended by a guard of honour of 140 men under arms, and accompanied him to the ship. There he presented him with his own sword, \\"the hilt,\\" says Downton, \\"of massie gold, and in lieu thereof I returned him my sute, being sword, dagger, girdle, and hangers, by me much esteemed of, and which made a great deal better show, though of less value.\\" Downton's position at Surat was, however, still one of anxiety and difficulty. A succession commission had been given to Edwardes, the second in command, who appears to have been intriguing to procure Downton's dismissal, and who, at any rate, wrote many complaints. Within little more than a month of his arrival Downton had written home (20 November 1614), complaining of others being joined in authority with him. On 3 March, Downton with his four ships left Surat, intending to go to Bantam. They were scarcely outside before they saw the Portuguese fleet coming in from the westward, and for the next three days the two fleets were in presence of each other, Downton being all the time in doubt whether the viceroy was going to attack him, or to slip past him and make an attack on Surat, which he would have equally felt bound to defend. The viceroy, however, did not think it prudent to persevere in face of Downton's bold attitude, and \\"on the 6th he bore up with the shore, and\\"‚Äîto quote Downton's journal‚Äî\\"gave over the hope of their fortunes by further following of us.\\" The Portuguese having now gone clear away, the English were free to pursue their route. On 19 March they doubled Cape Comorin, and on 2 June the New Year's Gift and Solomon anchored in Bantam Roads. The return to the 'stinking stew' proved fatal to Downton, and he died on 6 August. Elkington, the captain of the Solomon, noted in his journal under date 5 August: \\"I was aboard with the general, then very ill, and the next day had word of his departure.\\" Personal life Of Downton's family nothing seems to be known, except that he had one only son, George, who accompanied him in both voyages, and died at Surat on 3 February 1614‚Äì15, while they were hourly expecting the renewal of the Portuguese attack, and when, as the general touchingly noted in his journal, \\"I had least leisure to mourn.\\" Early the next morning he was buried ashore, and the volley appointed to try the temper of the Portuguese viceroy served also to honour his burial.

It was founded by Ruben Soto in 2008 and is headquartered in Illinois. In 2016 Hourglass Angel was one of the 5,000 fastest growing companies in America, and Soto was included in Forbes 30 Under 30.  History  As a student at the University of Michigan, Ruben Soto worked for his father at his clothing wholesaling business in Chicago's Little Village that catered mostly to Latinas. Noticing that clients were looking for shapewear that was stronger and more durable, Soto launched Hourglass Angel as an e-commerce site during his junior year. At first, he focused mostly on waist cinchers called fajas, which means \\"wraps\\" in Spanish. Fajas, which used to be imported from Colombia, were originally used by new mothers to regain their figures immediately and by recovering liposuction or cesarean section patients to prevent swelling. As one of the fastest-growing businesses in the country, the company grew nearly 900 percent in the period 2009-2012, hitting $3.2 million in revenue in 2012. In 2013, Hourglass Angel employed 10 people and was selling body shapers and control garments from more than 150 brands. Jessica Alba stated in 2013 that she used corsets to regain her post-baby figure. In the same year, sales of company's top three waist trainers were up 250%. In 2014, Kim Kardashian endorsed waist training on Instagram. She was followed by her sisters and other celebrities, who started wearing corsets and posting their selfies online. Soto's revenues in 2014 were over $8 million. As of 2016, Hourglass Angel was included in Inc. Magazine's rankings of the 5,000 fastest-growing companies in America. Soto was included in Forbes 30 Under 30.  Products  Hourglass Angel sells corsets with hook- and-eye enclosures and steel stays, or boning. It also offers latex waist cinchers, described as \\"Spanx on steroids.\\" The company also offers products that are less intense than corsets: exercise leggings that purport to battle cellulite, \\"butt-lifting\\" jeans and slimming support tanks for men. Soto launched a house brand called Amia in 2013 and Hourglass Angel in 2018. Other brands sold by Hourglass Angel include Bali, Ann Michell, Carnival, Co‚Äôcoon, Lytess, Overbra, Sassybax, Slim Me, Squeem, Vedette, and Yummie Tummie. The company's most popular products are the waist trainers and the waist cinchers.

He played college football at Washington. He signed with the Los Angeles Rams as an undrafted free agent in 2016. College career Littleton attended the University of Washington. Professional career =Los Angeles Rams= 2016 season: Rookie year Littleton went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft. On May 4, 2016, the Los Angeles Rams signed Littleton to a three-year, $1.63 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $15,000 as an undrafted free agent. Throughout training camp, Littleton competed for a roster spot as a backup outside linebacker against Josh Forrest, Cameron Lynch, Ian Seau, and Matthew Wells. Head coach Jeff Fisher named Littleton a backup outside linebacker to begin the regular season, behind Akeem Ayers and Mark Barron. Littleton made his NFL debut in the season-opening 28‚Äì0 road loss against the San Francisco 49ers. During Week 13, he collected a season-high eight combined tackles during a 26‚Äì10 loss at the New England Patriots. The following week, he earned his first NFL start and made one tackle in the Rams' 42‚Äì14 loss against the Atlanta Falcons. Littleton finished his rookie year with 20 combined tackles (15 solo) in 16 games and one start. He was also won the Carroll Rosenbloom Memorial Award as the team's rookie of the year. 2017 season On January 13, 2017, the Rams announced their decision to hire Washington Redskins' offensive coordinator Sean McVay as their new head coach. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips installed a base 3-4 defense. During training camp, Littleton competed to be a backup inside linebacker against Josh Forrest and Bryce Hager. Head coach Sean McVay named Littleton a backup inside linebacker to begin the season, behind Mark Barron and Alec Ogletree. Littleton ended the season strong. During Week 16, he recorded seven combined tackles, deflected a pass, made his first NFL sack and interception during a 27‚Äì23 road victory against the Tennessee Titans. The following week, he collected a season-high eight combined tackles in a 34‚Äì13 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Littleton finished the season with 36 combined tackles (22 solo), four pass deflections, one sack, and one interception in 16 games and four starts. The Rams finished the season atop the NFC West with an 11‚Äì5 record and qualified for the playoffs. On January 6, 2018, Littleton appeared in his first NFL playoff game and made one tackle during a 26‚Äì13 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Wildcard Game. 2018 season Littleton entered training camp slated as a starting inside linebacker after Alec Ogletree was traded to the New York Giants. Head coach Sean McVay named Littleton and Mark Barron the starting inside linebackers to start the regular season, alongside outside linebackers Matt Longacre and Samson Ebukam. Littleton started in the season-opener against the Oakland Raiders and recorded 13 combined tackles (11 solo), broke up a pass, and made an interception in a 33‚Äì13 road victory. Two weeks later against the Los Angeles Chargers, he had 10 combined tackles (5 solo), a pass deflection, and blocked a punt in the end zone that was recovered by Blake Countess for a touchdown in a 35‚Äì23 win. During a Week 7 39-10 road victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Littleton again had 10 total tackles (8 solo), including two sacks. He also was credited with the first safety of his pro career after blocking a punt out of the end zone during the second quarter. Littleton has earned high praise in his first season as a full-time defensive starter for the Rams. Head coach Sean McVay said, ‚ÄúCan't really understate what a great job and what an impact Cory Littleton's made.‚Äù Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips also remarked, ‚ÄúI don't know that any linebacker is playing as well as he is in both areas. He's way ahead of everybody in the league as far as pass coverage.‚Äù On December 18, 2018, Littleton was voted to the 2019 Pro Bowl as a special-teams starter. He finished the regular season with a then-career-high 125 tackles, a career-high four sacks, 13 pass deflections, three interceptions, a forced fumble, and an interception returned for a touchdown in 16 games and starts. In the playoffs, Littleton recorded seven tackles in a 30‚Äì22 victory against the Dallas Cowboys and 12 tackles in a 26‚Äì23 overtime road victory against the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game to reach Super Bowl LIII where they lost 13‚Äì3 to the New England Patriots. In the Super Bowl, he recorded 10 tackles, two passes defended, and an interception. 2019 season On March 12, 2019, the Rams placed a second-round restricted free agent tender on Littleton. On May 20, 2019, Littleton signed his tender for one year, $3.095 million.

She served in France in World War I and is the only Australian woman to have received the Medaille de la Reconnaissance Fran√ßaise (Medal of French Gratitude). Early life Gray was born in Melbourne on 24 April 1876. She was the eldest of the eight children of Samuel Gray, a clothing manufacturer from Cavan, Ireland, and his English-born wife Amelia, n√©e Bird. She attended Lee Street State School in East Melbourne, and the Presbyterian Ladies' College. In March 1900, she entered Melbourne Hospital as a nursing probationer. She gained her certificate on 12 March 1903 and was promoted to the position of staff nurse two days later, followed by another promotion to the position of sister on 29 May. Career In 1908 Gray left Melbourne Hospital and was appointed Matron at the Queen's Memorial Infectious Diseases Hospital. The following year she returned to Melbourne Hospital as house matron and two years later, in 1911, became assistant lady superintendent. In January 1913, Gray became matron of Perth Hospital. In February 1915, Gray enlisted in the Australian Army Nursing Service, and ten days later left for England. When she arrived in England she found that the mansion which had been offered for use as a hospital, Harefield Park House in Middlesex, had not been prepared and was not ready to be used. She was required to advise on all necessary alterations, equipment and furniture to make the buildings capable of holding convalescent patients. Over the coming years, Gray managed the growth of the hospital from 150 to 1000 beds. In December 1916 Gray was transferred to the 2nd Australian General Hospital at Wimereux, France, where she remained until the closure of the hospital in March 1919. She was then moved back to England and nursed at an Australian General Hospital in Sutton Veny. Matron Ethel Gray (seated). The other nurses are Sisters Laura Cumming Pratt (standing, top right); Emily Mills; Helena Chadwick and Marguerite Mills, exact positions unknown. After she was demobilised, she returned to Melbourne and took the position of matron at a new hospital founded by the Methodist Church, Epworth Hospital. She retired in 1939 and died in Epworth on 22 July 1962. = Honours and legacy = In June 1917 she received the Royal Red Cross, 1st class, for her work at Harefield.

After breaking the woman's world record for altitude without oxygen on Mount Everest in 1992, in 1997 she became the first French woman to reach the South Pole alone, covering some 1,400 km (870 miles) in 57 days. More recently she has coordinated work at the French Antarctic station Dumont d'Urville. Biography Born in Casablanca, Morocco, on 16 March 1957, de la Ferri√®re came from a well-established French family. Her great-grandfather had been a banker, her grandfather an engineer and her father a salesman for a brick company. In 1965, as a result of upsets in Morocco, she and her family moved to the Lyon region in France. On qualifying from secondary school, she went on an Alpine mountaineering course in Courmayeur where she met her husband, Bernard Muller a seasoned climber. Together they climbed some of the world's highest mountains. In 1984, she broke the woman's record for altitude without oxygen on Nepal's Yalung Kang. After giving birth to two daughters, C√©line and Charlotte, two years later she again broke the altitude record, climbing Mount Everest. During the European winter of 1996‚Äì97, de la Ferri√®re became the first French woman to reach the South Pole unassisted, covering the distance from the Weddell Sea to the Amundsen-Scott base at temperatures around -40 C while dragging a 150 kg (310 lb) sledge behind her. It was the moment she had always waited for. In her own words: > It's as if you have infinity in front of you, the infinitely large, the > infinitely beautiful, the infinitely white, infinite freedom. For me, it's > the greatest sense of freedom a human being can experience. As I walked > along, I would turn around, look at my tracks, they were endless, it was > wonderful. De la Ferri√®re returned to Antarctica in 2009, this time to head the French Dumont d'Urville Station for a period of 15 months. With a team of 25 scientists and technicians, of whom a third were women, the objective was to measure the thickness of the ozone layer and analyse residues in the ice. In 2012, she coordinated renovation work at the Dumont d'Urville Station which had been built in the 1950s. No longer interested in feats of endurance or exploration, she now spends the remainder of her time lecturing in France and Europe, explaining how important it is to study the Antarctic in order to improve understanding of climate change. Publications In early 2000, de la Ferri√®re published an account of her Antarctic experiences in Seule dans le vent des glaces (Alone in the glacial wind).

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  The town  Birdsville was known as Diamantina Crossing from the 1870s when a rough depot was set up there by Matthew Flynn but, by 1882, the name Birdsville was in common use. It was adopted in the 1885 survey and was formalised at the proclamation of town in 1887. Many of Australia's pioneering European explorers travelled through the Birdsville district well before the town was gazetted. Monuments to acknowledge the feats of Captain Charles Sturt, Burke and Wills, Cecil Madigan and others are located throughout the town. The hotel The hotel, a singled-storeyed sandstone building, was erected for publican William Blair. The earliest section is likely to have been constructed in 1883 (possibly from stone quarried at a site about from the town), as the first licence for this hotel was issued to William Blair in that year. On the official Birdsville town survey plan of mid-1885, the building is marked as Wm Blair's hotel. On 24 February 1886, Blair purchased from the Crown, for , the allotment at the corner of Adelaide and Burt streets which contained the hotel. A month earlier he had bought for the allotment at the rear, which contained a fenced yard and had frontages to Burt & Graham streets; also an unimproved allotment adjacent to this, fronting Graham Street, for . Each block comprised . Following Blair's death in 1898, title to all three blocks passed to Queensland Trustees (Charles H Morton was the licensee during this period), then to the Hayden family in 1912, the Gaffney family in 1918, and the Dixon family in 1947. In 1979, a sale was concluded with Australian adventurer Dick Smith but failed when the hotel burned down the day after contracts were signed. The hotel later featured as the major waypoint on Smith's Bourke to Burketown Bash charity race held in 1985. In 1980, David Brook, a descendant of the Gaffney family, and his friend Kim Fort purchased the hotel and held it for 40 years until selling to its current owners Courtney and Talia Ellis, co-founders of Outback Spirit Tours. The building continues to function as a hotel, and has become nationally famous. With its longevity, romantic remoteness, and as a focus for festivities associated with the annual Birdsville Races, the Birdsville Hotel has become an outback icon. It is understood that in 1905 a cyclone destroyed all of the structures on the site other than those constructed in stone. In 1964 the southeast corner of the building collapsed, also as a result of a cyclone. This section was reconstructed -91, although not to original detail. A fire destroyed the front bar, also in 1964; this has been rebuilt. The major changes to the building have been the replacement of the front verandah, additions to the northern end, and reconstruction of the southeast section. Internally, no original finishes appear to exist as the floors have been laid in slate, walls plastered and painted, and ceilings altered. The building however retains its essential character.  Description  Birdsville Hotel The Birdsville Hotel is a single-storeyed building constructed of local stone rendered and scribed. It has elevations to Burt and Adelaide Streets and the corner of the building at the street intersections has been truncated marking the original main entrance. The hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron and is concealed by a low masonry parapet raised at the corner to carry the words \\"Birdsville Hotel\\" and \\"Established 1884\\". An awning of corrugated iron supported by timber posts and decorated by a scalloped timber valance runs along the street elevations and is also truncated at the corner. Quoining at the windows and doors is picked out in a dark colour, as it has been since at least the 1920s. There are extensive modern additions including a beer garden and extra bars. Across the road from the hotel () is a monument to Augustus Poeppel, who surveyed the borders between Queensland and South Australia.  Heritage listing  Birdsville Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Birdsville Hotel, erected , survives as an important link with the earliest establishment of pastoral settlement in the Diamantina district of far western Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is rare as one of only three surviving masonry buildings in Birdsville, the others being the former Royal Hotel and the 1888-90 police station and courthouse. These contribute significantly to the historic character of the town which, in the last quarter of the 20th century, became a principal Queensland tourist attraction. The Birdsville Hotel is also a rare surviving late 19th century outback hotel, and besides being important in illustrating its type, also has the potential, through physical investigation and documentary research, to reveal important information about the design, form and function of far western Queensland hotel complexes of this period, and about the people who erected such buildings. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Birdsville Hotel is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a vernacular style of masonry construction that spread throughout central Australia, across South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland in the late 19th century, efficiently controlling the extremes of temperature in the hot, arid interior of the continent, and compensating for the lack of locally-available timber. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

These contribute significantly to the historic character of the town which, in the last quarter of the 20th century, became a principal Queensland tourist attraction. The place has aesthetic value, and is important in defining the Birdsville townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Birdsville Hotel has social value as an outback cultural icon of national significance, a place that has become part of central Australian legend.

The suit alleged that Shein withheld evidence in violation of the RICO Act in cases brought against John Crane by sufferers of mesothelioma. Benjamin Shein was also personally named as a defendant. Specifically, the suit alleges that Shein failed to disclose during discovery that their clients had been exposed to products containing asbestos made by other companies and intentionally delayed filing claims against those companies' bankruptcy trusts. John Crane said that it would have avoided judgements and \\"substantial defense costs\\" if it had known this information. In another complaint, John Crane alleged that Shein \\"fabricated false asbestos 'exposure histories' for their clients in asbestos litigation ‚Ä¶ and systematically concealed evidence of their clients' exposure to other sources of asbestos.\\" References Law firms based in Philadelphia ","title":"Shein Law Center"},{"id":"51546225","text":"Purvis is an unincorporated community in northern Camden County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

Presumed extinct after 56 years without recorded observations, the species was rediscovered in 2015.  Description  Dysphania pusilla is an annual, puberulent herb, growing to around in length and often forming a cushion-like covering on surfaces such as clay and rocks. The herb is distinguishable from other species of the genus (such as the introduced Dysphania pumilio) through the slightly smaller seeds, a different number of tepals and the close positioning of the leaves in relation to each other. The herb, existing in both green and brown colour morphs, produces small green and yellow flowers during the warmer months.  Etymology  The name is derived from the term pusilla, which is the Latin word for 'very small'.  Location  Dysphania pusilla, a New Zealand endemic, is generally located in the north-eastern corner of the South Island of New Zealand; Harry Allan in his ' (1961) mentions that it does not grow south of 43¬∞30'S. The plant is usually found in dry, sparsely-vegetated open spaces, including ephemeral wetlands, but has also been known to bloom in urban environments such as railway yards and agricultural land.  History  The plant was first recorded in 1864 as Chenopodium pusillum by Joseph Dalton Hooker in his systematic work Handbook of the New Zealand Flora. Missionary Richard Taylor in his book Te Ika a Maui: or, New Zealand and its inhabitants (1855) had recorded the MƒÅori proverb explaining that \\"This saying is applied to a diligent husbandman. The parahia is a diminutive kind of spinach, which overruns their cultivations.\\" Parahia was identified as Ctenopodium pusillum by botanist William Colenso in a paper presented to the Hawke's Bay Philosophical Institute on 9 June 1879. In 2008, botanists Sergei Leonidovich Mosyakin and Steven Earl Clemants re-allocated this taxon to the genus Dysphania. The plant was prevalent until 1959, when the last known sample was located beside a railway siding in Christchurch, and although Colenso had described it as abundant in Maori cultivations, it got no mention in any lists of indigenous \\"weeds\\" affecting agriculture or horticulture, and was by 1999 considered data deficient. In 2012, \\"following repeated surveys in known or expected habitats at appropriate times\\", Dysphania pusilla was considered extinct. Botanist Shannel Courtney, Department of Conservation's Technical Support Officer for Flora and Restoration and the 2008 Loder Cup recipient, stumbled upon a widespread growth of the species near a tributary of the Clarence River in January 2015, followed by reports of other specimens found in the Ruataniwha wetlands in the McKenzie Basin, and a third discovery in March in the Heron Basin in mid-Canterbury. Botanists speculate that seeds of D. pusilla lie dormant for decades awaiting suitable growing conditions. The plant is still threatened by habitat loss to date, due to introduced species and changes in land use for agricultural purposes and cattle grazing. Thus, in both 2017 and 2018, it was declared \\"Threatened - Nationally Endangered\\".

In 2007 she handed over to her son, Volker K√∂hnen, responsibility for the daily running of the family business (known in recent decades as \\"The Food Professionals K√∂hnen AG\\") she had built up. By this time she was responsible for more than 100,000 published recipes. Since 1965 she has significantly influenced both home cooking and commercial food production in her native Germany. Life The youngest of four children, Friederun K√∂hnen was born in Dresden during the war. When she was 23, with startup capital of 600 Marks, she launched herself as a freelance experimental chef. Working from improvised premises in the cellar of her parents' home, she quickly made an impression on the German food industry with her innovative ideas. Early on she successfully approached the owners of the M√ºller's M√ºhle food conglomerate, a major producer of dried peas, beans and other pulses, with a proposal that many customers would prefer to buy these products in cans/tins, in order to avoid having to soak the contents overnight before they could be used for cooking. The idea caught on with consumers, and the resulting canned products can be seen as Germany's original \\"ready meals\\" (\\"Fertiggerichte\\"). The business launch coincided with wider changes in the food industry. A breakthrough came when K√∂hnen addressed the issues arising from the appearance in homes, during the 1960s and 1970s, of domestic freezers. Another branch of her entrepreneurial zeal ripe for expansion involved the recent arrival of supermarkets in West Germany. Many products which till that point had been sold fresh now needed to be packaged, and K√∂hnen was able to supply recipes and pictures of prepared dishes that could be printed on the packaging. In this way she was able to introduce consumers to new recipe ideas. In a contract with the Galbani company, at that time little known outside Italy, she was able to introduce consumers to hitherto unknown culinary ingredients such as Mozzarella, Mascarpone and Rucola. She was one of those who revealed Tiramisu to sweet toothed West Germans. K√∂hnen also popularised little known Asiatic ingredients such as Tofu and Soy sauce, including them in her recipes which by this time were appearing in her own cookery books. In 1984 the private television company RTL was launched and K√∂hnen applied to supply a cookery show. Her proposal was that the show should be financed by producers of the items it featured, using what became known as product placement. The broadcaster accepted the initiative and K√∂hnen presented her own daily ten minute cookery show, working alongside the moderator Horst Tempel. \\"Komm doch mal in die K√ºche\\" (\\"Come into the Kitchen\\") ran for four years, attracting audiences of several million, which commentators infer was far more than the RTL could have dreamed of so early in the channel's own life. K√∂hnen was not new to television at this point. Back in the 1970s she had presented a \\"television cookery column\\" for WDR's Hier und Heute (Here and Today) magazine programme. Over the years the experimental kitchen evolved to become \\"The Food Professionals K√∂hnen AG\\", based in Sprockh√∂vel, and today employing approximately 50 people with annual turnover around 3.7 Million Euros. In 2010 Volker K√∂hnen, the son of the founder (and a qualified photographer and ships' mechanic) took over at the top of the executive board, having already served as chief executive since 2007. Friederun K√∂hnen switched to the supervisory board. The business model embraces marketing campaigns, the development of new recipes and other food industry innovations. They also publish cookery books and produce product photographs in their own studios. Recent projects include the development of new product ideas such as a Currywurst (sausage) suitable for the Microwave. and a Schnitzel suitable for the Toaster.

It is expected to span four chapters, the first of which opened in New York City during July 2016. Counts drew inspiration for Paradiso from Dante's Divine Comedy and the experience features elements of crime noir.  Paradiso: Chapter 1  The first chapter's premise places ten participants in a locked apartment that they must escape while also evading the Virgil Corporation, a shadowy crime gang. Players must solve puzzles within a certain span of time, otherwise they will not be able to complete the entire experience. Special effects such as 3D technology and actors are used during the experience to enhance game play.  Reception  Paradiso: Chapter 1 received praise from media outlets such as Fangoria and the New York Daily News, the former of which felt that it was an \\"intense and reinvigorating escape room experience\\" and compared it favorably to similar immersive theater experiences by Counts. The New Yorker was mostly positive in their review, noting that while the puzzles and plot \\"feel desultory\\" the show worked as a haunted house experience. The New York Times commented that \\"What you get out of it will depend on what you put into it, and perhaps on whom you bring along\\", further remarking that knowing the strengths fellow participants ahead of time would potentially make it faster to solve puzzles, as time was limited.

Frescoes from the Faras Cathedral in the background. J√≥zef Gazy (1910‚Äì1998) was a Polish artist, sculptor and restorer. Author of several monuments set in public space in various cities in Poland. In the 1960s he served as the leader of a team responsible for removal, maintenance, conservation and restoration of frescoes from the cathedral of Faras.  Biography  J√≥zef Gazy was born in 1910. In 1937, he graduated from Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. In 1945 he joined the Office for the Reconstruction of the Capital (BOS). As part of his work there he was one of the creators of Warsaw's Monument to Brotherhood in Arms; he was also the sculptor to re-create the missing elements of the Sigismund's Column destroyed by the Germans during World War II. In the 1940s he was also one of the sculptors responsible for the decoration of the buildings of Marsza≈Çkowska Residential District in Warsaw. In 1951 he authored the Monument of Polish- Soviet Brotherhood of Arms in Legnica; during Stalinist period he created four additional monuments, similar to the one in Legnica, for various cities in Poland. Socialist-realist Polish-Soviet Brotherhood in Arms Monument in Legnica is one of the best-known sculptures by J√≥zef Gazy In 1962 J√≥zef Gazy became a member of the Polish archaeological expedition of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw conducting the excavations at Faras. He led the field team of art restorers which dealt with securing frescoes discovered in the cathedral of Faras, preserving them, removing them from the walls and preparing them for transport. A big part of the work on the site he carried out personally, aided by Marta Kubiak. He remained part of the team until the very end of excavations, and left it only with the last group of Polish archaeologists, together with professor Micha≈Çowski, Stefan Jakobielski, Tadeusz Dzier≈ºykray-Rogalski, Marek Marciniak, Antoni Ostrasz and photographer of the expedition, Andrzej Dziewanowski, soon before the Faras site was flooded by the waters of newly-constructed Lake Nasser. His skills and ingenuity allowed for more that 120 frescoes to be rescued from the site. While working in Egypt, Gazy also helped William Y. Adams with maintenance and restoration of frescoes at the nearby archaeological site of Meinarti. Between 1966 and 1969 Gazy continued his work on maintenance and restoration of paintings in the National Museum in Khartoum, where he was responsible for preparing the first permanent exhibition of Nubian painting, scheduled for 1972. Upon his return to Poland, he joined the team of restorers preparing the exhibition of the Polish part of the Faras collection, led by Hanna Jƒôdrzejewska. The Faras Gallery was opened to the public in 1974. For his work on saving the Nubian art J√≥zef Gazy received, among other decorations, the Sudanese Order of Merit. In mid-1970s J√≥zef Gazy returned to his sculpting career, interrupted more than a decade before. He remained in contact with the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology as its expert and conservator. Among other projects, he supervised the restoration of sculptures of a lion and antelope found by Polish archaeologists in the temple of Al-Lat in Palmyra. In 1988 a monument of Pope John Paul II of his authorship was unveiled in front of the Zamo≈õƒá Cathedral; it was one of the first monuments to John Paul II in the world. J√≥zef Gazy died in 1998.

It is a co-production of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Ireland, and was selected as the Norwegian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards. In December 2016, it made the shortlist of nine films to be considered for a nomination at the 89th Academy Awards.  Plot  The film focuses on King Haakon VII and the Norwegian Royal Family in the days before and immediately after the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. On 8 April, Crown Prince Olav informs his father that the transport ship that was sunk off Lillesand earlier that day was carrying German soldiers, and expresses concern that the government of Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold refuses to give up Norway's neutrality in the face of German aggression. At the German embassy in Oslo, German envoy Curt Br√§uer is instructed by military attach√© Lieutenant-Colonel Hartwig Pohlman to encourage the Norwegian government to allow German troops into the country, under the pretext of defending Norway from a British invasion. Early the following morning, Br√§uer brings the German offer to Foreign Minister Halvdan Koht; after consulting the Cabinet, Koht refuses, stating that Norway is a sovereign nation. Meanwhile, at Oscarsborg Fortress near Dr√∏bak, Colonel Birger Eriksen prepares his undermanned and inexperienced garrison for combat, while receiving reports from the outlying fortresses of incoming German ships. Early on the morning of 9 April, Eriksen spots the German cruiser Bl√ºcher entering Dr√∏bak Sound. Despite having received no instructions from Oslo to engage, Eriksen considers the German ship to be hostile and gives the order to fire, and the fortress's guns and torpedo battery sink the Bl√ºcher. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold telephones the King, informing him of the impending invasion, and advises him to flee Oslo. The Royal Family boards a train for Hamar, where the Norwegian Parliament convenes to discuss negotiations with Germany. Br√§uer meets Oslo's police chief Kristian Welhaven, his intermediary with the Norwegian Cabinet, to reassure them of his desire to negotiate; at the same time, Pohlman receives orders from Berlin to send paratroopers to Hamar to capture the King and the Cabinet. Nasjonal Samling leader Vidkun Quisling proclaims himself Prime Minister over the national radio, and calls upon the Norwegian people to accept the German occupation forces. Br√§uer receives instructions from Hitler himself to go directly to the King and convince him to recognise Quisling's government, though Br√§uer is convinced that neither Haakon nor the Cabinet will accept this. As German troops advance towards Hamar, the Royal Family and the Cabinet relocate to Elverum, where the decision is made to send Olav's wife and three children to Sweden while the King and the Crown Prince remain in the country. Just after midnight on 10 April, the German paratroopers attack a roadblock at Midtskogen, and are beaten back by the Norwegian volunteers. At Nybergsund, the Cabinet meets to discuss Br√§uer's request to meet the King alone to end the hostilities. Despite Olav's objections and fears for his father's safety, Haakon agrees to meet with Br√§uer at Elverum. Br√§uer urges Haakon to follow the example of his elder brother, King Christian of Denmark, to capitulate without further resistance. Haakon relays the German demands to the Cabinet and states he cannot accept Quisling as Prime Minister, offering to abdicate if the Cabinet felt otherwise. Inspired by the King's decision, the Cabinet informs Br√§uer of their refusal. In response, German aircraft bomb Elverum and Nybergsund, forcing Haakon and the Cabinet to flee into the woods. The King, the Crown Prince, and the Cabinet eventually escape to Britain, where they remain until the end of the war. In May 1945, following the German surrender, Haakon is reunited with his grandson, Prince Harald, in London before the Royal Family returns to Norway.

United Kingdom is a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights on 11 July 2002. The applicant, Christine Goodwin, a United Kingdom national born in 1937, was a trans woman. She claimed that she had problems and faced sexual harassment at work during and following her gender reassignment. She also alleged that the fact that she keeps the same NI number has meant that her employer has been able to discover that she previously worked for them under another name and gender, with resulting embarrassment and humiliation.  Complaints  Relying on Articles 8, 12, 13 and 14 of the Convention, the applicant complained about her treatment in relation to employment, social security and pensions and her inability to marry.  Judgement  ECtHR found a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights; a violation of Article 12 (right to marry and to found a family); and did not find a violation of Article 13 (right to an effective remedy). It found that no separate issue had arisen under Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).  Reasoning  No concrete or substantial hardship or detriment to the public interest had been demonstrated as likely to flow from any change to the status of transgender people. Society might reasonably be expected to tolerate a certain inconvenience to enable individuals to live in dignity and worth in accordance with the gender identity chosen by them at great personal cost. It concluded that the fair balance that was inherent in the Convention now tilted decisively in favour of the applicant. There had, accordingly, been a failure to respect her right to private life in breach of Article 8. The Court also found no justification for barring the individual due to her being transgender from enjoying the right to marry under any circumstances. It concluded that there had been a breach of Article 12. The case-law of the Convention institutions indicated that Article 13 could not be interpreted as requiring a remedy against the state of domestic law. In the circumstances no breach of Article 13 arose. The lack of legal recognition of the change of gender of a transgender person laid at the heart of the applicant's complaints under Article 14 of the Convention and had been examined under Article 8 so there was no separate issue arose under Article 14.  Reception  The government's loss of the Goodwin case was a factor in the introduction of the Gender Recognition Act 2004.

He currently holds the Chair of Mineralogy and Crystallography in the Department of Earth Sciences in the University of Florence. He is also a research associate at the Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse of the National Research Council (Italy) (CNR). He has received national and international scientific awards that include the President of the Republic Prize 2015 in the category of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences. Since 2019 is a Member of the National Academy of Lincei. Bindi is credited with the co-discovery of the first known natural quasicrystal, having identified a potential candidate from the mineral collection at the Universite‚Äô di Firenze. . The discovery ultimately showed that quasicrystals can form spontaneously in nature and remain stable for geological times.  Recognition  Awards for his research, include: * Panichi Prize for mineralogical investigations of the Italian Society of Mineralogy and Petrology (2004) * Nardelli Prize awarded by the Italian Association of Crystallography (2006) * Excellence Research Medal awarded by the European Mineralogical Union * Foreign Outstanding Young Researcher Award from the Russian Mineralogical Society (2007) * Luigi Tartufari Prize for Geology of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (2010) * President of the Republic (2015) * Aspen Institute Italia Award with Paul J. Steinhardt for scientific research and collaboration between Italy and the United States (2018) Two of his scientific works related to the discovery of the first natural quasicrystal, icosahedrite, were cited in Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2011 ‚Äì The Discovery of Quasicrystals of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On 29 May 2018, the asteroid 92279 Bindiluca was named in his honor.  Research  Bindi has numerous international collaborations, especially with Princeton University, Harvard University, and the California Institute of Technology. His research activity, condensed in more than 300 scientific publications, has been devoted to four different areas: a) mantle mineralogy (clinopyroxenes, garnets, akimotoite, bridgmanite, hiroseite, ahrensite, wadsleyite, post- spinel phases, dense hydrous magnesium silicates); b) aperiodic structures in the mineral kingdom (melilite, fresnoite, calaverite, natrite, muthmannite, pearceite-polybasite, icosahedrite, decagonite); c) superstructures, twinning, OD-phenomena and structural complexity in minerals (melilites, pearceite, polybasite, samsonite, calaverite, empressite, fettelite, quadratite, sinnerite, sartorite, meneghinite, zinkenite); d) structure solution of unknown structures and description of new mineral species (about 250 crystal structures solved and ~100 new mineral species described) Significant among his research works are the crystal-chemical studies of major mineral phases for the Earth's mantle, and studies of potassium-rich clinopyroxene, which had broad international resonance. He is also very well known for his studies on the complexity of mineral structures integrating mineralogy with the most- advanced fields of crystallography.  Controversies  In July 2020, on the basis of an anonymous report, the Florence edition of national newspaper La Repubblica wrote that Professor Bindi took up portions of the text of his program as candidate for the position of Head of the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Florence. La Repubblica reports that Professor Bindi said that it was only a provisional, unofficial document, which would have been discussed with all the members of the department in case he was elected. Further, Bindi commented that he had carefully read many election programs of candidates for the position of Director of the Department, precisely to learn and be stimulated by the initiatives planned for other departments so as to find ideas to be taken up and possibly improved in his department. On July 27th 2020, Bindi has been elected as Head of the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Florence with 97% of the votes https://www.dst.unifi.it/art-193-scrutinio-della-votazione.html.

Kati Kati is a co-production of One Fine Day Films and Ginger Ink. At the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, Kati Kati won the Prize of the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) for the Discovery programme. It was selected as the Kenyan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot Without any recollection of what happened before, young Kaleche finds herself in the middle of the wilderness. She makes her way to Kati Kati, a nearby lodge, where she meets a motley crew of residents under the leadership of Thoma. They inform her that she is dead and won‚Äôt be able to leave Kati Kati. She quickly assimilates into the group and together they enjoy Kati Kati‚Äôs luxurious distractions. Kaleche soon realizes that afterlife is not only fun and games, every member of the group seems to still carry a burden from their previous life. Mikey, a recent graduate and basketball enthusiast with a history of self-harm, is struggling with leaving his mother behind. When he is finally capable of letting her go, Mikey transitions out of his existence at the lodge. Kaleche becomes curious about the now apparent possibility of transition. She questions the reclusive painter King, formerly a priest who died in a post election violence revenge attack. Kaleche learns about a strange condition which renders the lodges residents flesh cold, white and lifeless. When Kaleche reveals to Toma that her skin has begun to whiten, Thoma confronts King, blaming him for Kaleche‚Äôs condition and revealing that King was killed in a revenge attack because he let his own parishioners burn to death outside his church. Later that night, Kaleche finds King, outside his cottage, burning his possessions, his skin white from head to toe and his eyes blackened. To Kaleche‚Äôs horror and surprise, King walks straight out into the darkened nowhere, no longer bound by Kati Kati. Since Kaleche‚Äôs arrival, affections between her and Thoma had been growing daily, but when both share an intimate moment it comes to an abrupt end. During a group session, Grace reveals to Kaleche that Thoma has known all along who she is, as they were married in their previous lives. Kaleche confronts Thoma who reveals that his drinking led to a fatal car crash. The rest of the residents are taken back by Thoma‚Äôs revelation and believe that he has been holding all of them back. Dragged through the place by the angry mob, Thoma begins to settle with his fate, believing that he is beyond redemption. Kaleche breaks through the mob, and embraces Thoma. An unspoken act of forgiveness allows Thoma to find peace and transition. Background Following the success of feature film Soul Boy, One Fine Day Films and Kenyan-based production company Ginger Ink partnered with DW Akademie to design a two-module training initiative: One Fine Day Film Workshops. The first module, a classroom-like \\"mini film school\\", deepens and expands the skill set and cinematic language of already practicing African filmmakers. It widens cinematic perspectives, exposure and vocabulary. Treasuring African Stories and wanting to enable talented filmmakers from the continent to reach a larger number of viewers is what One Fine Day Films are working for. In 2012, the second feature film to come out of the One Fine Day Film Workshops, Nairobi Half Life by Tosh Gitonga, was the first ever Kenyan entry to the Oscars. Mbithi Masya from Kenya, former student of the class of 2010, was selected to co-write and direct the next movie ‚Äì soon KATI KATI was born. Andrew Mungai, also a graduate of the One Fine Day Film Workshops was chosen as the cinematographer and many more crew members could be recruited out of the many trained departments. In cooperation with the Goehde Foundation, One Fine Day Films developed a Film Music Workshop out of which the music for KATI KATI was composed. The Kenyan composers where then invited to Cologne to rehearse the music together with the Jungle Orchester NRW. Awards and accolades At the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, Kati Kati won the Prize of the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) for the Discovery programme. Kati Kati also received the New Voices/New Visions Award Special Mention at the 2017 Palm Springs International Festival and The Filmpris (Film Prize) at the 19th CinemAfrica Film Festival in Stockholm, Sweden. The director, Mbithi Masya was also awarded The Emerging Filmmaker Award at the 2017 Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival. Kati Kati led the nomination slate for the 2017 Kalasha awards with a total of 13 nominations,among them best actor and best actress in a movie.

He shares the same birthday 18 May, as his grandfather, also Joseph William Foster who had died 18 months earlier. Joe's grandfather was the founder of J.W. Foster and Sons and the pioneer of the spiked running shoe, and also developed the trainer (sneaker). Career In 1943 at the age of 8, Joe won an American Webster's dictionary in an 80 yards sprint race in his home town of Bolton. This was the dictionary where Joe was to find the word Reebok (the American spelling), in 1960. If he had won an English Dictionary he would have found the word spelt, Rhebok. Joe and his late brother Jeff were born into the J W Foster & family business, but on their return after 2 years away from home on National Service, they asked questions about the future. The year was 1955 and the brothers saw a business still rooted in the 1930s. Their father and uncle were now operating the business and very much like another sports shoe company (Adidas), spent more time feuding than collaborating. The result was that in 1958 Joe and Jeff left the Foster business to set up their own business. 6 miles down the road in the next town, Bury, the brothers founded \\"Mercury Sports Footwear\\", which after 18 months they changed its name to 'Reebok'. Joe had been advised to protect their company‚Äôs name by registering it. Finding the word Mercury was registered by another company started the search for a new name and one source was Joe's Webster's dictionary. Leafing through for inspiration Joe came across grey rhebok, a small South African antelope, this sounded just right and was free to register.

In the early years Joe travelled many miles introducing Reebok‚Äôs offering shoes to Sports Retailers up and down the country.

A year later a young producer re-assembles the cast and re-opens the theatre, intending to the stage the same play performed on the night of the murder. Originally set for a filming schedule of 10 days and $10,000, the film went over budget and over schedule. On its release, it received positive reviews from Variety, The Hollywood Reporter and The New York Daily News. Main cast Production The House of Fear began production on March 16, 1939 with a budget just over $100,000.

Theatrically released on April 14, 2017 in the United States by GKIDS, it was selected to be screened in the Vanguard section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Dash (voiced by Schwartzman) and his best friend Assaf (Watts) are sophomores at Tides High School, a school located at a cliff edge above a fault line. The friends write as a team for the school newspaper, edited by mutual friend Verti (Rudolph). But one day Verti assigns Assaf to write a story solo about the new auditorium opening in the top floor, and Dash clearly picks up a relationship forming between Assaf and Verti. Feeling angered and betrayed, Dash writes a hurtful article about Assaf that provokes Principal Grimm to put a mark on his permanent record. Dash breaks into the school archives to find his record, but discovers evidence that Grimm had forged the inspection report for the auditorium. He also runs into Mary, a junior overachiever trying to find her confiscated cell phone. Dash tries to warn the rest of the students, but gets thrown into detention along with Mary for breaking into the archives, right when the auditorium opens causing the school to break off the cliff and fall into the ocean. Dash rescues Assaf and Verti from the sophomore level library, and Verti figures out that they can swim through the seawater by breathing trapped pockets of air. Dash nearly drowns, but is rescued by Lunch Lady Lorraine. At the junior level floor, the teachers are trying to bring surviving kids in line. It takes Lorraine to calm down a riot; she further shows her survival skills by saving Verti from a group of drug dealing students. The trio plus Lorraine and Mary decide to make it to the roof, but no one else wants to follow them. At the senior level floor, they find Brent Daniels organizing a hostile cult around him. They then find Grimm, who admits to the forgery. Grimm points out that they can scale to the roof using the back of the auditorium bleachers, and then sacrifices his life to open the bleachers up. The five friends reach the roof just as rescue helicopters arrive. Lorraine rescues a handful of other students while some others escape using a makeshift raft. Dash and Assaf vow to write a book about the disaster. Many weeks later, the surviving students attend a party for the release of Dash and Assaf's book, \\"Our Entire High School Sinking into the Sea\\". Reviews of the book come out mixed to negative because of Dash's turgid prose. Lorraine notes to Dash that she has a new year's worth of students to feed and take care of, before leaving the party.

When a mine stops to operate, its maintenance systems also stop, in which the dewatering systems are included. Without these systems the mine will get flooded by water that naturally sits in rock formations and in the ground. Overview Flooded shaft in Ecton Mine, UK Mining operations can occur during a long period of time (from several years to several decades) and in order to keep the mining operations running, water has to be constantly removed from the mine sites when needed.Canada, Natural Resources Canada. 4. Mine Closure, Mining Sequence: Mining Information for Aboriginal Communities, 2011 After the mine is closed, which happens when its operational life ends, the maintenance systems stop. Also, the dewatering systems cease to operate. Without any kind of work towards dewatering, the closed mines tend to get flooded with surface and groundwaters in the lower levels and mined spaces, if there is not a drainage adit present. The flooding process of an open-pit or underground mine can take from a several months period to more than a decade. The time it takes for a mine to get flooded depends on factors such as quantity of open space in the mine, availability of infiltration water and on the nature of flooding - it can be uncontrolled, controlled or monitored.Wolkersdorfer, C., 2008: Water Management at Abandoned Flooded Underground Mines ‚Äì Fundamentals, Tracer Tests, Modelling, Water Treatment, 465 pp. Open pit mines Flooding in open pit mines leads to the so-called pit lakes, where a wide range of creatures can be seen. The flooding process happens because the drainage wells or dewatering pumps stop to work and the open mining spaces are filled with groundwaters and surface waters. Surface waters come from precipitation and water bodies (e.g. rivers) and groundwaters come from bodies connected to the pit or from abandoned underground mine workings. Waters that flood open pit mines can range from drinking water quality to acidic waters that can kill animals if drunk. Underground mines Flooding in underground mines is usually controlled. These types of mines are not directly influenced by surface waters, so it is mainly underground water that plays a role in the flooding. One of the main reasons to let an underground mine be flooded is to avoid disulfide oxidation and thus, avoid acid mine drainage. Other important reason is safety: people coming to underground mines without safety precautions or the presence of dangerous mine gases. The controlled flooding of underground mines usually follows these guidelines: * Removal of potential water hazards * Fill the surfaces that might collapse during or after the flooding process * Install water diversion systems * Install, at both the surface and underground, a system to monitor hydrogeological and geotechnical aspects * Make a projection of hydrological and hydrogeochemical development of mine waters Reasons for mine flooding There are a wide range of factors that leads to mine flooding. Six of those main reasons are:Wolkersdorfer, C., 2008: Water Management at Abandoned Flooded Underground Mines ‚Äì Fundamentals, Tracer Tests, Modelling, Water Treatment, 465 pp. * The mine ceases to be economically important * Depletion of raw materials * Political reasons, war or accidents * Instability of the mine workings * Prevention of disulfide oxidation * Safety reasons In some locations, flooded mines have been converted into pumped-storage hydroelectric reservoirs.Companies increasing energy storage developments as renewables grow Historical mine flooding disasters * Chasnala mine * Quecreek Mine * Wangjialing mine * Knox Mine * Milford Mine * Luotuoshan mine * Jiangjiawan Minehttp://www.mining-technology.com/news/newschinas-jiangjiawan-coal-mine- flood-kills-16-miners-4559642 References Mining ","title":"Flooded mine"},{"id":"51546963","text":"Music for Leisure was a budget record label in New Zealand that released many compilation albums.

SAE 316L grade stainless steel, sometimes referred to as A4 stainless steel or marine grade stainless steel, is the second most common austenitic stainless steel after 304/A2 stainless steel. Its primary alloying constituents after iron, are chromium (between 16‚Äì18%), nickel (10‚Äì12%) and molybdenum (2‚Äì3%), with small (<1%) quantities of silicon, phosphorus & sulfur also present. The addition of molybdenum provides greater corrosion resistance than 304, with respect to localized corrosive attack by chlorides and to general corrosion by reducing acids, such as sulfuric acid. 316L grade is the low carbon version of 316 stainless steel. When cold worked, 316 can produce high yield and tensile strengths similar to Duplex stainless grades.
