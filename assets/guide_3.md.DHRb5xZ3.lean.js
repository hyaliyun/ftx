She completed nurses' training at the New York Post-Graduate Hospital in 1899 and entered private practice soon thereafter. Lenah Higbee took postgraduate training at Fordham Hospital, New York in 1908.  Career  In October 1908, she joined the newly established U.S. Navy Nurse Corps as one of its first twenty members. These nurses, who came to be called \\"The Sacred Twenty\\", were the first women to formally serve as members of the Navy. She was promoted to Chief Nurse in 1909. Lenah Higbee became Chief Nurse at Norfolk Naval Hospital in April 1909. In January 1911, Higbee became the second Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps. For her achievements in leading the Corps through the First World War, Chief Nurse Higbee was awarded the Navy Cross.

The name \\"vanellus\\" is Latin for \\"little fan\\", vanellus being the diminutive of vannus (\\"winnowing fan\\"). The name is in reference to the sound lapwings' wings make in flight.Terres & NAS (1980): p.741 Description These long-legged waders mostly have strongly patterned plumage. Although the most familiar Eurasian lapwing, Vanellus vanellus (northern lapwing), has a wispy crest, only two other species do so. Red or yellow facial wattles are a more typical decoration. Only northern, sociable, white-tailed, grey-headed and brown-chested lapwings are truly migratory species. The Andean lapwing moves downhill in winter. Spur-winged, blacksmith, river, southern, Andean and pied lapwings are boldly patterned, red-eyed species with a spurred carpal (wrist) joint. Many species have wattles which can be small (black-headed, spot-breasted, red-wattled and banded lapwings) or large (white-crowned, African wattled, yellow-wattled, Javan, and masked lapwings). The latter species are the largest of the plover family, since several exceed . Systematics The genus Vanellus was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The name was derived by tautonymy from the original binomial name of the northern lapwing Tringa vanellus introduced by Linnaeus in 1758. Vanellus is the Medieval Latin for a \\"lapwing\\". It is a diminutive of the Latin vanus meaning \\"winnowing\\" or \\"fan\\". The systematics of Vanellus have hitherto resisted clear resolution. Essentially, no major revision can be brought to agree with another, and up to 19 genera were at one time recognized for the 24 lapwing species. While it might be desirable to split up this large and diverse genus a bit, the morphological characters are a confusing mix of apomorphic and plesiomorphic traits in any one species, with few relationships readily apparent. Molecular data has been found to provide even less sufficient resolution, though the lapwings have not yet been as thoroughly studied under this aspect as other Charadriiformes.Piersma & Wiersma (1996), Thomas et al. (2004) The only thing that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that according to the DNA sequence data one group of 5 species seems to stand out. These are wattle-less lapwings which were separated as Anitibyx, Belonopterus, Hoplopterus (in the narrow sense) and Ptiloscelys. They are visually very dissimilar, but it is notable that their distribution forms a clean band through the tropical regions of the world except Australia; they might conceivably form a clade. The only species among them that is migratory is the Andean lapwing (V. resplendens), which as noted above cannot be allied with the truly migratory lapwings on these grounds. However, if these were to be split off, for one thing it is almost certain that other lineages would also require separation; the new genus' name would probably be Hoplopterus, which is the longest- and most widely used alternative lapwing genus. =List of species in taxonomic order= * Northern lapwing, also known as green plover and as peewit, Vanellus vanellus Alternatively placed in Hemiparra: * Long-toed lapwing, Vanellus crassirostris Alternatively placed in Anitibyx: * Blacksmith lapwing or blacksmith plover, Vanellus armatus Alternatively placed in Hoplopterus: * Spur-winged lapwing or \\"spur-winged plover\\", Vanellus spinosus * River lapwing or \\"spur-winged lapwing\\", Vanellus duvaucelii Alternatively placed in Sarciophorus, Lobivanellus or Hoplopterus: * Black-headed lapwing or black- headed plover, Vanellus tectus Alternatively placed in Lobipluvia or Hoplopterus: * Yellow-wattled lapwing, Vanellus malabaricus Alternatively placed in Xiphidiopterus or Hoplopterus: * White-crowned lapwing, white-headed lapwing, white-crowned plover or white-headed plover, Vanellus albiceps Alternatively placed in Stephanibyx or Hoplopterus: * Senegal lapwing or lesser black-winged lapwing, Vanellus lugubris * Black-winged lapwing or greater black-winged lapwing, Vanellus melanopterus Crowned lapwing in Tanzania * Crowned lapwing or crowned plover, Vanellus coronatus Alternatively placed in Afribyx: * African wattled lapwing or wattled lapwing, Vanellus senegallus Alternatively placed in Tylibyx, Lobivanellus or Hoplopterus: * Spot-breasted lapwing, Vanellus melanocephalus Alternatively placed in Anomalophrys: * Brown-chested lapwing, Vanellus superciliosus Alternatively placed in Microsarcops or Hoplopterus: * Grey-headed lapwing, Vanellus cinereus Alternatively placed in Lobivanellus or Hoplopterus: * Red-wattled lapwing, Vanellus indicus Alternatively placed in Rogibyx: * Javan lapwing, Javanese lapwing, or Javanese wattled lapwing, Vanellus macropterus Alternatively placed in Zonifer, Lobivanellus or Hoplopterus: * Banded lapwing, Vanellus tricolor Alternatively placed in Lobibyx, Lobivanellus or Hoplopterus: * Masked lapwing or \\"spur-winged plover\\", Vanellus miles Alternatively placed in Chettusia: * Sociable lapwing or sociable plover, Vanellus gregarius Alternatively placed in Vanellochettusia or Chettusia: * White-tailed lapwing or white-tailed plover, Vanellus leucurus Alternatively placed in Hoploxypterus: * Pied lapwing, Vanellus cayanus Alternatively placed in Belonopterus: * Southern lapwing, Vanellus chilensis Alternatively placed in Ptiloscelys or Belonopterus: * Andean lapwing, Vanellus resplendens Prehistoric species Species known only from fossil or subfossil remains include: * Vanellus madagascariensis (14th century Madagascar) * Vanellus lilloi (Middle/Late Pleistocene of Centinela del Mar, Argentina) * Vanellus downsi (Late Pleistocene of Rancho La Brea, USA) * Vanellus edmundi (Late Pleistocene of Talalra, Peru) The last three of these seem to be very closely related to the southern lapwing and all were placed in Belonopterus by the describing authors. If Viator picis, also from the Late Pleistocene of Talara, does not belong to an entirely extinct lineage, it might belong to that group too; it seems too large to be closely related to the smallish pied lapwing.Campbell (2002) Neither the Early Oligocene DolicopterusNot Dolichopterus, contra Ml√≠kovsk√Ω (2002) from Ronzon, France nor the supposed mid-Oligocene lapwing \\"Vanellus\\" selysii of Rupelmonde (Belgium) unquestionably belong here.

In classical cryptography, padding may include adding nonsense phrases to a message to obscure the fact that many messages end in predictable ways, e.g. sincerely yours. Classical cryptography Official messages often start and end in predictable ways: My dear ambassador, Weather report, Sincerely yours, etc. The primary use of padding with classical ciphers is to prevent the cryptanalyst from using that predictability to find known plaintextGordon Welchman, The Hut Six Story: Breaking the Enigma Codes, p. 78. that aids in breaking the encryption. Random length padding also prevents an attacker from knowing the exact length of the plaintext message. A famous example of classical padding which caused a great misunderstanding is \\"the world wonders\\" incident, which nearly caused an Allied loss at the WWII Battle off Samar, part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf. In that example, Admiral Chester Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet in World War II, sent the following message to Admiral Bull Halsey, commander of Task Force Thirty Four (the main Allied fleet) at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, on October 25, 1944: With padding (bolded) and metadata added, the message became: Halsey's radio operator mistook some of the padding for the message, so Admiral Halsey ended up reading the following message: Admiral Halsey interpreted the padding phrase \\"the world wonders\\" as a sarcastic reprimand, causing him to have an emotional outburst and then lock himself in his bridge and sulk for an hour before moving his forces to assist at the Battle off Samar. Halsey's radio operator should have been tipped off by the letters RR that \\"the world wonders\\" was padding; all other radio operators who received Admiral Nimitz's message correctly removed both padding phrases. Many classical ciphers arrange the plaintext into particular patterns (e.g., squares, rectangles, etc.) and if the plaintext doesn't exactly fit, it is often necessary to supply additional letters to fill out the pattern. Using nonsense letters for this purpose has a side benefit of making some kinds of cryptanalysis more difficult. Symmetric cryptography =Hash functions= Most modern cryptographic hash functions process messages in fixed-length blocks; all but the earliest hash functions include some sort of padding scheme. It is critical for cryptographic hash functions to employ termination schemes that prevent a hash from being vulnerable to length extension attacks. Many padding schemes are based on appending predictable data to the final block. For example, the pad could be derived from the total length of the message. This kind of padding scheme is commonly applied to hash algorithms that use the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction. =Block cipher mode of operation= Electronic codebook and cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode are examples of block cipher mode of operation. Block cipher modes for symmetric-key encryption algorithms require plain text input that is a multiple of the block size, so messages may have to be padded to bring them to this length. There is currently a shift to use streaming mode of operation instead of block mode of operation. An example of streaming mode encryption is the counter mode of operation.https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/classes/s09/l05.pdf, pg 17 Streaming modes of operation can encrypt and decrypt messages of any size and therefore do not require padding. More intricate ways of ending a message such as ciphertext stealing or residual block termination avoid the need for padding. A disadvantage of padding is that it makes the plain text of the message susceptible to padding oracle attacks. Padding oracle attacks allow the attacker to gain knowledge of the plain text without attacking the block cipher primitive itself. Padding oracle attacks can be avoided by making sure that an attacker cannot gain knowledge about the removal of the padding bytes. This can be accomplished by verifying a message authentication code (MAC) or digital signature before removal of the padding bytes, or by switching to a streaming mode of operation. Bit padding Bit padding can be applied to messages of any size. A single set ('1') bit is added to the message and then as many reset ('0') bits as required (possibly none) are added. The number of reset ('0') bits added will depend on the block boundary to which the message needs to be extended. In bit terms this is \\"1000 ... 0000\\". This method can be used to pad messages which are any number of bits long, not necessarily a whole number of bytes long. For example, a message of 23 bits that is padded with 9 bits in order to fill a 32-bit block: ...  1011 1001 1101 0100 0010 0111 0000 0000  This padding is the first step of a two-step padding scheme used in many hash functions including MD5 and SHA. In this context, it is specified by RFC1321 step 3.1. This padding scheme is defined by ISO/IEC 9797-1 as Padding Method 2. Byte padding Byte padding can be applied to messages that can be encoded as an integral number of bytes. =ANSI X9.23= In ANSI X9.23, between 1 and 8 bytes are always added as padding. The block is padded with random bytes (although many implementations use 00) and the last byte of the block is set to the number of bytes added. Example: In the following example the block size is 8 bytes, and padding is required for 4 bytes (in hexadecimal format) ...         00 00 00 04  =ISO 10126= ISO 10126 (withdrawn, 2007ISO catalog, ISO 10126-1:1991ISO catalog, ISO 10126-2:1991) specifies that the padding should be done at the end of that last block with random bytes, and the padding boundary should be specified by the last byte. Example: In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes ...         81 A6 23 04  =PKCS#5 and PKCS#7= PKCS#7 is described in RFC 5652. Padding is in whole bytes. The value of each added byte is the number of bytes that are added, i.e. bytes, each of value are added. The number of bytes added will depend on the block boundary to which the message needs to be extended. The padding will be one of: 01 02 02 03 03 03 04 04 04 04 05 05 05 05 05 06 06 06 06 06 06 etc. This padding method (as well as the previous two) is well-defined if and only if is less than 256. Example: In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes ...         04 04 04 04  If the length of the original data is an integer multiple of the block size , then an extra block of bytes with value is added. This is necessary so the deciphering algorithm can determine with certainty whether the last byte of the last block is a pad byte indicating the number of padding bytes added or part of the plaintext message. Consider a plaintext message that is an integer multiple of bytes with the last byte of plaintext being 01. With no additional information, the deciphering algorithm will not be able to determine whether the last byte is a plaintext byte or a pad byte. However, by adding bytes each of value after the 01 plaintext byte, the deciphering algorithm can always treat the last byte as a pad byte and strip the appropriate number of pad bytes off the end of the ciphertext; said number of bytes to be stripped based on the value of the last byte. PKCS#5 padding is identical to PKCS#7 padding, except that it has only been defined for block ciphers that use a 64-bit (8-byte) block size. In practice the two can be used interchangeably. =ISO/IEC 7816-4= ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005ISO catalog, ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005 is identical to the bit padding scheme, applied to a plain text of N bytes. This means in practice that the first byte is a mandatory byte valued '80' (Hexadecimal) followed, if needed, by 0 to N ‚àí 1 bytes set to '00', until the end of the block is reached. ISO/IEC 7816-4 itself is a communication standard for smart cards containing a file system, and in itself does not contain any cryptographic specifications. Example: In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes ...         80 00 00 00  The next example shows a padding of just one byte ...          DD 80  Zero padding All the bytes that are required to be padded are padded with zero. The zero padding scheme has not been standardized for encryption, although it is specified for hashes and MACs as Padding Method 1 in ISO/IEC 10118-1ISO/IEC 10118-1:2000 Information technology ‚Äì Security techniques ‚Äì Hash-functions ‚Äì Part 1: General and ISO/IEC 9797-1.ISO/IEC 9797-1:1999 Information technology ‚Äì Security techniques ‚Äì Message Authentication Codes (MACs) ‚Äì Part 1: Mechanisms using a block cipher Example: In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes ...         00 00 00 00  Zero padding may not be reversible if the original file ends with one or more zero bytes, making it impossible to distinguish between plaintext data bytes and padding bytes. It may be used when the length of the message can be derived out-of- band. It is often applied to binary encoded strings (null-terminated string) as the null character can usually be stripped off as whitespace. Zero padding is sometimes also referred to as \\"null padding\\" or \\"zero byte padding\\". Some implementations may add an additional block of zero bytes if the plaintext is already divisible by the block size. Public key cryptography In public key cryptography, padding is the process of preparing a message for encryption or signing using a specification or scheme such as PKCS#1 v1.5, OAEP, PSS, PSSR, IEEE P1363 EMSA2 and EMSA5. A modern form of padding for asymmetric primitives is OAEP applied to the RSA algorithm, when it is used to encrypt a limited number of bytes. The operation is referred to as \\"padding\\" because originally, random material was simply appended to the message to make it long enough for the primitive. This form of padding is not secure and is therefore no longer applied. A modern padding scheme aims to ensure that the attacker cannot manipulate the plaintext to exploit the mathematical structure of the primitive and will usually be accompanied by a proof, often in the random oracle model, that breaking the padding scheme is as hard as solving the hard problem underlying the primitive. Traffic analysis and protection via padding Even if perfect cryptographic routines are used, the attacker can gain knowledge of the amount of traffic that was generated. The attacker might not know what Alice and Bob were talking about, but can know that they were talking and how much they talked. In some circumstances this leakage can be highly compromising. Consider for example when a military is organising a secret attack against another nation: it may suffice to alert the other nation for them to know merely that there is a lot of secret activity going on. As another example, when encrypting Voice Over IP streams that use variable bit rate encoding, the number of bits per unit of time is not obscured, and this can be exploited to guess spoken phrases. Similarly, the burst patterns that common video encoders produce are often sufficient to identify the streaming video a user is watching uniquely. Even the total size of an object alone, such as a website, file, software package download, or online video, can uniquely identify an object, if the attacker knows or can guess a known set the object comes from. The side-channel of encrypted content length was used to extract passwords from HTTPS communications in the well-known CRIME and BREACH attacks. Padding an encrypted message can make traffic analysis harder by obscuring the true length of its payload. The choice of length to pad a message to may be made either deterministically or randomly; each approach has strengths and weaknesses that apply in different contexts. =Randomized padding= A random number of additional padding bits or bytes may be appended to the end of a message, together with an indication at the end how much padding was added. If the amount of padding is chosen as a uniform random number between 0 and some maximum M, for example, then an eavesdropper will be unable to determine the message's length precisely within that range. If the maximum padding M is small compared to the message's total size, then this padding will not add much overhead, but the padding will obscure only the least-significant bits of the object's total length, leaving the approximate length of large objects readily observable and hence still potentially uniquely identifiable by their length. If the maximum padding M is comparable to the size of the payload, in contrast, an eavesdropper's uncertainty about the message's true payload size is much larger, at the cost that padding may add up to 100% overhead (2\\\\times blow-up) to the message. In addition, in common scenarios in which an eavesdropper has the opportunity to see many successive messages from the same sender, and those messages are similar in ways the attacker knows or can guess, then the eavesdropper can use statistical techniques to decrease and eventually even eliminate the benefit of randomized padding. For example, suppose a user's application regularly sends messages of the same length, and the eavesdropper knows or can guess fact based on fingerprinting the user's application for example. Alternatively, an active attacker might be able to induce an endpoint to send messages regularly, such as if the victim is a public server. In such cases, the eavesdropper can simply compute the average over many observations to determine the length of the regular message's payload. =Deterministic padding= A deterministic padding scheme always pads a message payload of a given length to form an encrypted message of a particular corresponding output length. When many payload lengths map to the same padded output length, an eavesdropper cannot distinguish or learn any information about the payload's true length within one of these length buckets, even after many observations of the identical-length messages being transmitted. In this respect, deterministic padding schemes have the advantage of not leaking any additional information with each successive message of the same payload size. On the other hand, suppose an eavesdropper can benefit from learning about small variations in payload size, such as plus or minus just one byte in a password- guessing attack for example. If the message sender is unlucky enough to send many messages whose payload lengths vary by only one byte, and that length is exactly on the border between two of the deterministic padding classes, then these plus-or-minus one payload lengths will consistently yield different padded lengths as well (plus-or-minus one block for example), leaking exactly the fine-grained information the attacker desires. Against such risks, randomized padding can offer more protection by independently obscuring the least-significant bits of message lengths. Common deterministic padding methods include padding to a constant block size and padding to the next- larger power of two. Like randomized padding with a small maximum amount M, however, padding deterministically to a block size much smaller than the message payload obscures only the least-significant bits of the messages true length, leaving the messages's true approximate length largely unprotected. Padding messages to a power of two (or any other fixed base) reduces the maximum amount of information that the message can leak via its length from O() to O(\\\\log ). Padding to a power of two increases message size overhead by up to 100%, however, and padding to powers of larger integer bases increase maximum overhead further. The PADM√â scheme, proposed for padded uniform random blobs or PURBs, deterministically pads messages to lengths representable as a floating point number whose mantissa is no longer (i.e., contains no more significant bits) than its exponent. This length constraint ensures that a message leaks at most O(\\\\log ) bits of information via its length, like padding to a power of two, but incurs much less overhead of at most 12% for tiny messages and decreasing gradually with message size.

In North America and elsewhere where it is common for public and private corporations to raise funds through the issue of bonds, the term is normally used in this context. However, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere where the issue of bonds (other than government bonds) is unusual, and where long-term leasehold tenancies are common, the term is only normally used in the context of replacement or renewal of capital assets, particularly the common parts of buildings. Borrowing money by issuing a bond is referred to as floating a bond. Sinking is its opposite, repaying debt or acquiring capital assets without debt. Historical context The sinking fund was first used in Great Britain in the 18th century to reduce national debt. While used by Robert Walpole in 1716 and effectively in the 1720s and early 1730s, it originated in the commercial tax syndicates of the Italian peninsula of the 14th century, where its function was to retire redeemable public debt of those cities. The fund received whatever surplus occurred in the national Budget each year. However, the problem was that the fund was rarely given any priority in Government strategy. The result of this was that the funds were often raided by the Treasury when they needed funds quickly. In 1772, the nonconformist minister Richard Price published a pamphlet on methods of reducing the national debt. The pamphlet caught the interest of William Pitt the Younger, who drafted a proposal to reform the Sinking Fund in 1786. Lord North recommended \\"the Creation of a Fund, to be appropriated, and invariably applied, under proper Direction, in the gradual Diminution of the Debt\\". Pitt's way of securing \\"proper Direction\\" was to introduce legislation that prevented ministers from raiding the fund in crises. He also increased taxes to ensure that a ¬£1 million surplus could be used to reduce the national debt. The legislation also placed administration of the fund in the hands of \\"Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt\\". The scheme worked well between 1786 and 1793 with the Commissioners receiving ¬£8 million and reinvesting it to reduce the debt by more than ¬£10 million. However, the outbreak of war with France in 1793 \\"destroyed the rationale of the Sinking Fund\\" (Eric Evans). The fund was abandoned by Lord Liverpool's government only in the 1820s. Sinking funds were also seen commonly in investment in the 19th century in the United States, especially with highly invested markets like railroads. An example would be the Central Pacific Railroad Company, which challenged the constitutionality of mandatory sinking funds for companies in the case In re Sinking Funds Cases in 1878. > SECT. 3.

More specifically, it is a fund into which money can be deposited, so that over time preferred stock, debentures or stocks can be retired. See also \\"sinking fund provision\\" under Bond (finance)#Features. In some US states, Michigan for example, school districts may ask the voters to approve a taxation for the purpose of establishing a sinking fund. The State Treasury Department has strict guidelines for expenditure of fund dollars with the penalty for misuse being an eternal ban on ever seeking the tax levy again. =Types= A sinking fund may operate in one or more of the following ways: # The firm may repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the open market each year. # The firm may repurchase a fraction of outstanding bonds at a special call price associated with the sinking fund provision (they are callable bonds). # The firm has the option to repurchase the bonds at either the market price or the sinking fund price, whichever is lower. To allocate the burden of the sinking fund call fairly among bondholders, the bonds chosen for the call are selected at random based on serial number. The firm can only repurchase a limited fraction of the bond issue at the sinking fund price. At best some indentures allow firms to use a doubling option, which allows repurchase of double the required number of bonds at the sinking fund price. # A less common provision is to call for periodic payments to a trustee, with the payments invested so that the accumulated sum can be used for retirement of the entire issue at maturity: instead of the debt amortizing over the life, the debt remains outstanding and a matching asset accrues. In this way a fund is built up with the intention of paying off the debt in full at a specified future date instead of directly paying the debt down over time. This method was popular in the 1980s-90's in the UK household mortgage market. =Benefits and drawbacks= For the organization retiring debt, it has the benefit that the principal of the debt or at least part of it, will be available when due. For the creditors, the fund reduces the risk the organization will default when the principal is due: it reduces credit risk. However, if the bonds are callable, this comes at a cost to creditors, because the organization has an option on the bonds: * The firm will choose to buy back discount bonds (selling below par) at their market price, * while exercising its option to buy back premium bonds (selling above par) at par. Therefore, if interest rates fall and bond prices rise, a firm will benefit from the sinking fund provision that enables it to repurchase its bonds at below-market prices. In this case, the firm's gain is the bondholder's loss ‚Äì thus callable bonds will typically be issued at a higher coupon rate, reflecting the value of the option. Modern context - capital expenditure Sinking funds can also be used to set aside money for purposes of replacing capital equipment as it becomes obsolete, or major maintenance or renewal of elements of a fixed asset, typically a building. Such a fund is also commonly called a reserve fund, however the distinguishing feature of a sinking fund is that the payments into it are calculated to amortize a forecast future expenditure whereas a reserve fund is intended to equalise expenditure in respect of regularly recurring service items to avoid fluctuations in the amount of service charge payable each year.

The Swedish name for the Finnish parliament was lantdag up until 1919, when it was officially changed to riksdag. To be noted however is that the Russian Emperor used the French word for Diet when he addressed the estates. Swedish Borg√• lantdag;Older spelling landtdag. Russian –ë–æ—Ä–≥–æ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–µ–π–º), was the summoned legislative assembly to establish the Grand Principality of Finland in 1809 and the heir of the powers of the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates. The session of the Diet lasted from March to July 1809. The sovereign's pledge, printed in Finnish During the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, the four Estates of Russian occupied Finland (Nobility, Clergy, Burghers and Peasants) were assembled at Porvoo (Borg√•) by Tsar Alexander I, the new Grand Prince of Finland, between 25 March and 19 July 1809. The central event at Porvoo was the sovereign pledge and the oaths of the Estates in Porvoo Cathedral on 29 March. Each of the Estates swore their oaths of allegiance, committing themselves to accepting the Emperor as Grand Prince of Finland as the true authority, and to keeping the constitution and the form of government unchanged. Alexander I subsequently promisedThe declaration by the tsar at the diet of Porvoo, as officially translated, reprinted by Kustavi Grotenfelt [1861-1928]: Suomenkielisi√§ historiallisia asiakirjoja Ruotsin vallan ajalta (vuosilta 1548-1809), Helsinki 1912; at Wikisource: Julistus Suomen entisen uskonnon ja perustuslakien vahvistamisesta. to govern Finland in accordance with its laws and let the Finnish keep their religion and rights. This was thought to essentially mean that the emperor confirmed the Swedish Instrument of Government from 1772 as the constitution of Finland, although it was also interpreted to mean respecting the existing codes and statutes. The diet had required that it would be convened again after the Finnish War, which separated Finland from Sweden, had been concluded. On 17 September, the conflict was settled by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn but it would be another five decades until the Finnish Estates would be called again. During the rise of Finnish nationalism later in the 19th century, it was claimed that the Diet implied that a Treaty between states had been signed at the Diet between Finland and Russia. According to Emeritus Professor Jussila of Helsinki University, it is true that Alexander said that Finland had been raised to the status of a nation among nations, but the claim of a treaty between equals was simply a device invented for the political realities of the struggle for independence. Participants  Diet had participants from different estates as follows: * Nobility 75 representatives, chairman lantmarskalk count Robert Wilhelm De Geer. * Clergy 8 representatives, chairman bishop of Turku Jakob Tengstr√∂m * Burghers 20 representatives, chairman merchant Kristian Trapp, Turku * Peasants 31 representatives, chairman Pehr Klockars Uusikaarlepyy Out of 205 noble families 130 were not represented in the diet, and 60 of the representatives did not attend the opening ceremony.

What is a \\"vanishing\\" friction level is not clear, which makes the term superlubricity quite vague. As an ad hoc definition, a kinetic coefficient of friction less than 0.01 can be adopted. This definition also requires further discussion and clarification. Superlubricity may occur when two crystalline surfaces slide over each other in dry incommensurate contact. This effect, also called structural lubricity, was suggested in 1991 and verified with great accuracy between two graphite surfaces in 2004.Superlubricity of Graphite Martin Dienwiebel, Gertjan S. Verhoeven, Namboodiri Pradeep, Joost W. M. Frenken, Jennifer A. Heimberg, and Henny W. Zandbergen Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 126101 (2004) The atoms in graphite are oriented in a hexagonal manner and form an atomic hill-and-valley landscape, which looks like an egg-crate. When the two graphite surfaces are in registry (every 60 degrees), the friction force is high. When the two surfaces are rotated out of registry, the friction is greatly reduced. This is like two egg-crates which can slide over each other more easily when they are \\"twisted\\" with respect to each other. Observation of superlubricity in microscale graphite structures was reported in 2012,Observation of Superlubricity in Microscale Graphite Ze Liu, Jiarui Yang, Francois Grey, Jefferson Zhe Liu, Yilun Liu, Yibing Wang, Yanlian Yang, Yao Cheng, and Quanshui Zheng Phys.

Such effects were also theoretically describedSuperlubricity through graphene multilayers between Ni(111) surfaces for a model of graphene and nickel layers. This observation, which is reproducible even under ambient conditions, shifts interest in superlubricity from a primarily academic topic, accessible only under highly idealized conditions, to one with practical implications for micro and nanomechanical devices.Graphite super lube works at micron scale Philip Robinson, Chemistry World, 28 May 2012 A state of ultralow friction can also be achieved when a sharp tip slides over a flat surface and the applied load is below a certain threshold. Such \\"superlubric\\" threshold depends on the tip-surface interaction and the stiffness of the materials in contact, as described by the Tomlinson model. Transition from Stick-Slip to Continuous Sliding in Atomic Friction: Entering a New Regime of Ultralow Friction Anisoara Socoliuc, Enrico Gnecco, Roland Bennewitz, and Ernst Meyer Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 134301 (2004) The threshold can be significantly increased by exciting the sliding system at its resonance frequency, which suggests a practical way to limit wear in nanoelectromechanical systems.Atomic-Scale Control of Friction by Actuation of Nanometer-Sized Contacts Anisoara Socoliuc, Enrico Gnecco, Sabine Maier, Oliver Pfeiffer, Alexis Baratoff, Roland Bennewitz, and Ernst Meyer Science 313, 207 (2006) Superlubricity was also observed between a gold AFM tip and Teflon substrate due to repulsive Van der Waals forces and hydrogen-bonded layer formed by glycerol on the steel surfaces. Formation of the hydrogen- bonded layer was also shown to lead to superlubricity between quartz glass surfaces lubricated by biological liquid obtained from mucilage of Brasenia schreberi. Other mechanisms of superlubricity may include: (a) Thermodynamic repulsion due to a layer of free or grafted macromolecules between the bodies so that the entropy of the intermediate layer decreases at small distances due to stronger confinement; (b) Electrical repulsion due to external electrical voltage; (c) Repulsion due to electrical double layer; (d) Repulsion due to thermal fluctuations. The similarity of the term superlubricity with terms such as superconductivity and superfluidity is misleading; other energy dissipation mechanisms can lead to a finite (normally small) friction force. Superlubricity is more analogous to phenomena such as superelasticity, in which substances such as Nitinol have very low, but nonzero, elastic moduli; supercooling, in which substances remain liquid until a lower-than-normal temperature; super black, which reflects very little light; giant magnetoresistance, in which very large but finite magnetoresistance effects are observed in alternating nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic layers; superhard materials, which are diamond or nearly as hard as diamond; and superlensing, which have a resolution which, while finer than the diffraction limit, is still finite. Superlubricity at the macroscale In 2015, \\"Argonne\\" a team led by Dr. Anirudha Sumant have been able to experimentally demonstrate superlubricity at true microscale for the first time [8]. The detailed experimental investigations were supported by sophisticated computational studies. Argonne scientists used Mira [supercomputer] simulating up to 1.2 million atoms for dry environments and up to 10 million atoms for humid environments [8] The researchers used the LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) code to carry out the computationally demanding reactive molecular dynamics simulations. This team optimized LAMMPS and its implementation of ReaxFF by adding OpenMP threading, replacing MPI point-to-point communication with MPI collectives in key algorithms, and leveraging MPI I/O. Altogether, these enhancements allowed the code to perform twice as fast as before. \\"Dr. Sumant's research team has already acquired three US patents on superlubricity and more are in the process, which could potentially be used for applications in dry environments, such as computer hard drives, wind turbine gears, and mechanical rotating seals for microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems.

Boddaert was the son of a Middelburg jurist and poet by the same name (1694‚Äì1760). The younger Pieter obtained his M.D. at the University of Utrecht in 1764 and there became a lecturer on natural history. Fourteen letters survive of his correspondence with Carl Linnaeus between 1768 and 1775. He was a friend of Albert Schlosser, whose cabinet of \\"curiosities\\" of natural history he described. In 1783 he published fifty copies of an identification key of Edm√©-Louis Daubenton's Planches enlumin√©es, the colored plates of illustrations for the comte de Buffon's monumental Histoire Naturelle (published 1749‚Äì1789), assigning binomial scientific names to the plates. As many of these were the first Linnaean scientific names to be proposed, they remain in use. In 2017 the world list of birds maintained by Frank Gill and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists' Union included 190 taxa for which Boddaert is cited as the authority. Of these 112 are treated as species and 78 as subspecies. One species, the hoopoe starling, is now extinct.

The words, intended to be without meaning, were added as security padding in an encrypted message to hinder Japanese attempts at cryptanalysis, but were mistakenly included in the decoded text given to Halsey. Halsey interpreted the phrase as a harsh and sarcastic rebuke, and as a consequence dropped his futile pursuit of a decoy Japanese carrier task force, and, belatedly, reversed some of his ships in a fruitless effort to aid United States forces in the Battle off Samar. Without the support of Halsey's carrier force the immeasurably outgunned tiny force of destroyers, destroyer escorts, and escort carriers known as Taffy 3 fought what is regarded as the most lopsided and even suicidally heroic last stand in the annals of the United States Navy. Encryption Strategy Encryption cyphers can be defeated when easily guessed common patterns are recognized in the messages. Messages typically have common intros and salutations such as \\"Dear\\" and \\"Sincerely\\" which can lead to the defeat of the cypher. To remove common phrases from the start and the end, in WWII the US Navy would add unique non-relevant padding phrases separated from the main text by a word of two characters. The padding would be added before encoding and stripped after decoding. So a simple message like \\"Halsey: Come home. -CINPAC\\" might become the message \\"I love gibberish nn Halsey: Come home. - CINPAC rr exo zagrat a zpqtrec\\" during encrypted transmission. Background Nimitz (left) and Halsey in 1943 On October 20, 1944, United States troops invaded the island of Leyte as part of a strategy aimed at isolating Japan from the resource-rich territory it had occupied in South East Asia, and in particular depriving its forces and industry of vital oil supplies. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion. In the ensuing Battle of Leyte Gulf the Japanese intended to use ships commanded by Vice-Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa, \\"Northern Force\\", to lure the main American covering forces away from Leyte, thus allowing the main IJN forces, \\"Southern Force\\" and \\"Center Force\\", led by the 18-inch gunned super- battleship Yamato, the largest and most powerful ship afloat, to attack the invasion force in a pincer movement. Northern Force would be built around three expendable small light aircraft carriers, but these would have very few aircraft or trained aircrew, serving merely as \\"bait\\". Halsey, in command of the mobile naval forces covering the invasion's northern flank, fell for the ruse, and convinced that Northern Force constituted the main Japanese threat, proceeded northward in pursuit with the carriers of 3rd Fleet and a powerful force of battleships, designated Task Force 34. This left the landing beaches covered only by sixteen escort carriers with about 450 aircraft from the 7th Fleet. On the morning of the 25th a strong Japanese force of battleships slipped through the San Bernardino Strait headed toward the American landing forces, prompting their commander, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, to send a desperate plaintext message asking for support. Nimitz's message When Nimitz, at CINCPAC headquarters in Hawaii, saw Kinkaid's plea for help he sent a message to Halsey, simply asking for the current location of Task Force 34, which due to a previous misunderstanding, was unclear: With the addition of metadata including routing and classification information, as well as the padding at the head and tail, the entire plaintext message to be encoded and transmitted to Halsey was: U.S. Navy procedure called for the padding to be added to the start and end of the message, which were vulnerable to cryptanalysis due to the use of common phrases and words (such as \\"Yours sincerely\\") in those sections. The words chosen for padding should have been obviously irrelevant to the actual message, however Nimitz's enciphering clerk used a phrase that \\"[just] popped into my head\\". Coincidentally, historians note that \\"The world wonders\\" is also present in Lord Tennyson's poem \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" about the eponymous battle against long odds fought the exact same day nearly 100 years earlier. While decrypting and transcribing the message, Halsey's radio officer properly removed the leading phrase, but the trailing phrase looked appropriate and he seems to have thought it was intended and so left it in before passing it on to Halsey, who read it as: The structure tagging (the 'RR's) should have made clear that the phrase was in fact padding. In all the ships and stations that received the message, only the decoder on Halsey's flagship, the , failed to delete both padding phrases. Consequences The message (and its trailing padding) became infamous, and created some ill feeling, since it appeared to be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. \\"I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face\\", Halsey later recalled. \\"The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember\\", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, \\"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together!\\" Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its life--falsely claiming to be refueling his ships--before eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.

The Feistel based algorithm was first published in 1987 by Akihiro Shimizu and Shoji Miyaguchi from NTT. The cipher is susceptible to various forms of cryptanalysis, and has acted as a catalyst in the discovery of differential and linear cryptanalysis. There have been several different revisions of FEAL, though all are Feistel ciphers, and make use of the same basic round function and operate on a 64-bit block. One of the earliest designs is now termed FEAL-4, which has four rounds and a 64-bit key. Problems were found with FEAL-4 from the start: Bert den Boer related a weakness in an unpublished rump session at the same conference where the cipher was first presented. A later paper (den Boer, 1988) describes an attack requiring 100-10000 chosen plaintexts, and Sean Murphy (1990) found an improvement that needs only 20 chosen plaintexts. Murphy and den Boer's methods contain elements similar to those used in differential cryptanalysis. The designers countered by doubling the number of rounds, FEAL-8 (Shimizu and Miyaguchi, 1988). However, eight rounds also proved to be insufficient -- in 1989, at the Securicom conference, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir described a differential attack on the cipher, mentioned in (Miyaguchi, 1989). Gilbert and Chass√© (1990) subsequently published a statistical attack similar to differential cryptanalysis which requires 10000 pairs of chosen plaintexts. In response, the designers introduced a variable-round cipher, FEAL-N (Miyaguchi, 1990), where \\"N\\" was chosen by the user, together with FEAL-NX, which had a larger 128-bit key. Biham and Shamir's differential cryptanalysis (1991) showed that both FEAL-N and FEAL-NX could be broken faster than exhaustive search for N ‚â§ 31. Later attacks, precursors to linear cryptanalysis, could break versions under the known plaintext assumption, first (Tardy-Corfdir and Gilbert, 1991) and then (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992), the latter breaking FEAL-4 with 5 known plaintexts, FEAL-6 with 100, and FEAL-8 with 215. In 1994, Ohta and Aoki presented a linear cryptanalytic attack against FEAL-8 that required 212 known plaintexts.

It was published in Model Graphix in three parts, a monthly magazine about scale models, as a part of Hayao Miyazaki's \\"Zassou Note\\" series. Like other manga in this series, \\"Hik≈çtei Jidai\\" is a manifestation of his love for old planes. It is filled with aircraft from the 1920s (heavily modified by Miyazaki) and their technical details, as well as with the men (good-hearted and silly) who love them. Hik≈çtei Jidai was published in 1992 by Dainippon Kaiga (). It is a book of about 60 pages, includes the 'Porco Rosso' manga (15 pages total), several airplane vignettes, resin-kit models of aircraft, photos of some real counterparts of the floatplanes which appeared in the film, and some interviews with Miyazaki regarding airplane model kits. Differences from Porco Rosso Compared with the anime version, the manga is much more light-hearted. Other than being a \\"retired Italian Air Force pilot\\", Porco's past is not discussed, although the rise of fascism and the sentiment against it are mentioned. Gina doesn't appear at all, and Porco is much more lighthearted. Still, the basic story line and its charm are carried over into the anime. For the dogfight between Porco and Donald Chuck (the character was renamed Donald Curtiss in the anime), Miyazaki wrote; \\"If this were animation, I might be able to convey the grandeur of this life-or-death battle. But this is a comic. I have no choice but to rely on the imagination of you, good readers.\\" (At the time, the 'Porco Rosso' anime had not yet been announced.) Mamma Aiuto, who Porco saves in Part One, is also the name of a seaplane pirate gang in the movie. It is also Italian for \\"Help, mom!\\" The story It's the 1920s over the Adriatic Sea. Air pirates with their seaplanes plague the sea, attacking ships, robbing money, and kidnapping women. Enter an Italian bounty hunter, Porco Rosso. Flying his red seaplane, he is the best in the business. He is a very dashing fellow and women love him. There is, however, one peculiarity about him - he is a pig. ;Part One Porco Rosso saves a girl from the air pirates, the Mamma Aiuto gang. ;Part Two Porco is shot down by an American, Donald Chuck. Porco takes his plane to Milan-based Piccolo, SPA, for repairs. Fio, a 17-year-old girl, redesigns and improves his plane. ;Part Three Porco and Chuck have a great air battle for Fio and for Italian pride.

Biography  He was born at Rochefort, and entered the Naval Medical School in Rochefort at the age of sixteen. He served in the French Navy during the Napoleonic Wars; in 1811 he was third surgeon on the frigate Saale, and in 1813 was second surgeon on the Regulus.Pers√©e Un pharmacien de la marine et voyageur naturaliste : R.-P Lesson In 1816 Lesson changed his classification to pharmacist. He served on Duperrey's round-the-world voyage of La Coquille (1822‚Äì25), of which he collected natural history specimens with his fellow surgeon Prosper Garnot and officer Dumont d'Urville. During his visits to the Moluccas and New Guinea, Lesson became the first naturalist to see birds of paradise in the wild.New Guinea: crossing boundaries and history by Clive Moore On returning to Paris, he spent seven years preparing the section on vertebrates for the official account of the expedition: \\"Voyage autour du monde entrepris par ordre du Gouvernement sur la corvette La Coquille\\" (published from 1826 to 1839).Statement based on a translation of an equivalent article at the French Wikipedia. During this time period, he also produced \\"Manuel d'Ornithologie\\" (1828), \\"Trait√© d'Ornithologie\\" (1831), \\"Centurie Zoologique\\" (1830‚Äì32) and \\"Illustrations de Zoologie\\" (1832‚Äì35).Google Search (publications)WorldCat Search (publications) Lesson also published several monographs on hummingbirds and one book on birds of paradise: * Histoire naturelle des oiseaux-mouches. ouvrage orn√© de planches...

In the field of herpetology he described many new species of amphibiansAmphibian Species of the World. http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/. and reptiles.The Reptile Database. http://www.reptile-database.org. On the 3rd of February 1827 he married the artist and scientific illustrator Cl√©mence Dumont de Sainte- Croix. Dumont de Sainte-Croix along with her sister Zo√´ Dumont de Sainte-Croix illustrated plates in Lesson's publications. From 1831, he served as a professor of pharmacy, and following a series of promotions, became the top- ranking naval pharmacist at Rochefort (1835).Encyclopedia.com Lesson, Ren√©- Primev√®re His experience as a ship's surgeon resulted in his two-volume \\"Manuel d'histoire naturelle medicale, et de pharmacographie\\" (1833), intended as a handbook for naval surgeons. He became a corresponding member of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine in 1828, later becoming a correspondent of the Acad√©mie des Sciences (1833).Lesson, Ren√© Primev√®re (1794-1849) Correspondance familiale He received the L√©gion d'honneur in 1847. Ren√© Primev√®re Lesson is sometimes confused with his brother, Pierre Adolphe Lesson (1805-1888), who participated on the Astrolabe expedition (as the Coquille had been renamed) in 1826‚Äì29, under the command of Jules Dumont d'Urville. Amphibian and reptile species described by Lesson listed in the order they were described (only species still recognized are listed) *Litoria aurea (Lesson, 1826) as Rana aurea (green and golden bell frog) *Pleurodema thaul (Lesson, 1826) as Bufo thaul (Chile four-eyed frog) *Hylarana papua (Lesson, 1826) as Rana papua (Papua River frog) *Scincus cyanurus now Emoia cyanura (Lesson, 1826) (copper- tailed Emo skink) *Hinulia smaragdina now Lamprolepis smaragdina (Lesson, 1826) (emerald tree skink) *Calotes chiliensis now Liolaemus chiliensis (Lesson, 1826) (Chilean tree lizard) *Scincus noctua now Lipinia noctua (Lesson, 1826) (moth skink) *Varanus douarrha (Lesson, 1830) *Scincus atrocostatus now Emoia atrocostata (Lesson, 1830) (mangrove skink) *Scincus cyanogaster now Emoia cyanogaster (Lesson, 1830) (green-bellied Emo skink) *Lophurus brasiliensis now Enyalius brasiliensis (Lesson, 1830) (Brazilian fathead anole) *Gecko oceanicus now Gehyra oceanica (Lesson, 1830) (oceanic gecko) *Stellio peruvianus now Microlophus peruvianus (Lesson, 1830) (Peruvian coastal lizard) *Coluber ikaheka now Micropechis ikaheca (Lesson, 1830) (New Guinea small-eyed snake) *Naja kaouthia Lesson, 1831 (monocled cobra) *Crocodylus palustris Lesson, 1831 (mugger crocodile) *Euphlyctis hexadactylus (Lesson, 1834) as Rana hexadactylus (Indian bullfrog) *Draco bourouniensis Lesson, 1834 (Buru flying lizard) Amphibian and reptile species described in Lesson‚Äôs honour listed in the order they were described (only species still recognized are listed) *Rana esculenta var. lessonae now Pelophylax lessonae (Camerano, 1882) (pool frog) *Diploglossus lessonae Peracca, 1890 (Brazilian galliwasp) *Agama lessonae now Tapelus lessonae (De Filippi, 1865) (Lesson‚Äôs ground agama) Lesson and the idea that counting in New Zealand proceeded by elevens On his return from his voyage on the Coquille in 1825, Lesson published a French translation of ‚ÄúDu Grand Oc√©an, de ses √Æles et de ses c√¥tes‚Äù written by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso. In the article, von Chamisso had claimed that the number system of New Zealand was based on twenty: ‚Äú‚Ä¶de l‚ÄôE. de la mer du Sud ‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest l√† qu‚Äôon trouve premierement le syst√®me arithm√©tique fond√© sur un √©chelle de vingt, comme dans la Nouvelle- Z√©lande (2)...‚Äù [‚Ä¶east of the South Sea ‚Ä¶ is where we first find the arithmetic system based on a scale of twenty, as in New Zealand (2)...]. Lesson inserted the footnote (2) to mark this claim as an error: ‚Äú(2) Erreur. Le syst√®me arithm√©tique des Z√©landais est und√©cimal, et les Anglais sont les premiers qui ont propag√© cette fausse id√©e. (L.)‚Äù [(2) Error. The Zealander arithmetic system is undecimal, and the English are the first to propagate this misconception. (L).]‚Äù The term ‚Äúund√©cimal‚Äù was possibly a printer‚Äôs error that conjoined the phrase ‚Äúun decimal,‚Äù which would have correctly identified the New Zealand number system as decimal. Undecimal was interpreted to mean ‚Äúcounting by elevens,‚Äù as a parallel construction to the term ‚Äúduodecimal‚Äù for twelve-based counting. The mention of ‚Äúthe English‚Äù likely referred to Samuel Lee and Thomas Kendall, as their 1820 grammar of the New Zealand language had been von Chamisso‚Äôs source. Regardless of whether his 1825 use of ‚Äúund√©cimal‚Äù originated as a printer‚Äôs error or not, over the next several years, Lesson and his friend and shipmate Jules de Blosseville would deliberately embellish and attempt to establish as fact the idea that New Zealand had a base 11 number system. The idea was published in 1826 by the Italian geographer Adriano Balbi as the contents of a letter he received from Lesson, a missive that added an elevens-based numerical vocabulary (including terms meaning eleven squared and cubed) and details of its purported collection from New Zealand informants. It was again mentioned in 1826 by the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach, who reported it thirdhand as a letter written by Blosseville: ‚ÄúM. Nell de Br√©ant√© √©crit que, d'apr√®s les communications qu'il a re√ßues de M. de Blosseville, la carte des Carolines, et surtout celle de la Nouvelle-Z√©lande, est beaucoup chang√©e par les observations faites dans l'exp√©dition de la Coquille par le capitaine Duperrey. Dans cette derni√®re √Æle, on a trouv√© en usage un syst√®me de num√©ration und√©cimal\\" [Mr. Nell de Br√©aut√© writes that, according to the communications he has received from M. de Blosseville, the map of the Carolinas, and especially that of New Zealand, is much changed by the observations made in the expedition of the Coquille by Captain Duperrey. On this last island, a system of undecimal numbering was found in use]. Lesson was also likely to have authored an undated, anonymous essay found among and published with the papers of the Prussian linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt in 1839. The essay contains the most extensive detail of the known sources, mentioning Thomas Kendall by name and listing several North Island locations where the alleged informants were supposedly from, places that would have been known to Lesson from his 1824 visit to that island.

Early life Hooker was born in New Britain, Connecticut, on June 18, 1946. He began to play the drums at the age of 12. In high school, he played in a rock band, then switched to jazz. After graduating from Central Connecticut College, Hooker moved to California and became interested in free jazz. Later life and career Hooker moved to New York in the mid-1970s and was part of the loft scene, playing with musicians such as saxophonists David Murray and David S. Ware. His first recording as a leader was in 1976. His music was too radical to be commercially successful, and Hooker took other jobs to earn a living. This changed after he received praise for a 1988 recording, and he made frequent appearances at the Knitting Factory from early the following decade. Hooker was a founding member of the Text of Light, a musician's collective that released seven albums between 2004 and 2010. Hooker has led several bands, including a drums‚Äìtrumpet‚Äìsaxophone trio and an organ trio. They usually do not feature a bass, \\"because of the intensity and volume of his drumming\\". He has also been the drummer in duos with guitarists, including Elliott Sharp and Thurston Moore. Hooker's playing and recordings have embraced a wide range and combination of musics, including free jazz, noise rock, electronics, contemporary classical, and experimental electronic. The Down Beat reviewer of Hooker's Symphonie Of Flowers album wrote \\"Hooker uses history to enliven a suite of music that bounds through subgenres and percussive ideas\\". Playing style \\"He is an elemental drummer of considerable force, equally at home in free-form jazz and avant-garde rock circles; he also experiments with electronics and turntables\\".

Jackson announced his resignation on March 31, 2008.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/03/31/AR2008033102672.html Jackson Resigns as HUD Secretary Early life and career Jackson was born on September 9, 1945, in Marshall, Texas, and grew up in South Dallas as the youngest of twelve children in the family. His mother was a midwife, while his father sometimes worked as many as three jobs‚Äîas a foundry worker, janitor, and landscaper‚Äîto make ends meet. =Education= Jackson attended Truman State University and studied political science there. He went on to earn a master's degree in education administration from the school in 1969. But instead of taking a teaching job, Jackson enrolled in Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.Brennan, Carol. \\"Jackson, Alphonso R.\\" Contemporary Black Biography. 2005. Encyclopedia.com. October 1, 2012 In March 1965, Jackson, then a college freshman, participated in the first civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama that became known as Bloody Sunday. =Early career= Jackson began his professional career in St. Louis, as an assistant professor at the University of Missouri ‚Äì St. Louis. In 1977 he was named the city's director of public safety. He became executive director of the St. Louis Housing Authority four years later, a job he held until 1983. He left it to work as a consultant to a St. Louis accounting firm and intensified his political activities. Active in both Democratic and Republican circles in the city for many years, he even ran for a spot as St. Louis's municipal revenue collector. He also worked for the U.S. Senate campaign of Jack Danforth, a Republican. His rising profile earned him the attention of officials in Washington, and in 1987 he was made the director of the U.S. Department of Public and Assisted Housing for Washington, D.C. =Dallas Housing Authority= In 1989 Jackson was tapped to take over the Housing Authority of the City of Dallas as its president and chief executive officer. He was the first African American to lead the formerly troubled agency, which had become the target of discrimination lawsuits. In his seven years on the job, Jackson was credited with fixing the problems within the Dallas Housing Authority (DHA) and improving conditions for the city's poorest residents, who turned to it for help in a time of need. He worked to improve the run-down buildings and unsafe conditions that had become standard in the city's aging public-housing units, and also arranged deals that improved neighborhood conditions. He managed to find funds for a commercial development project, for example, that brought the first supermarket back to a struggling West Dallas neighborhood in several years. Jackson's seven-year stint in Dallas was not without its challenges. In 1995 the DHA began implementing a U.S. District Court order that came about after a mid-1980s challenge to desegregate the city's public- housing units. The court order called for 3,200 low-income families to be placed in neighborhoods that were predominantly white, and the agency drew up a plan for new units to be built in a section of North Dallas that was predominantly white. The townhouses or duplexes would house just 75 families, but some 2,000 local homeowners organized to fight it. =Private sector= In the end, Jackson left the public sector when Central Southwest Power, now American Electric Power offered him the vice president of corporate resources for CSW Energy and International in Dallas, Texas in 1996. In 1998, he became president of American Electric Power-Texas, an Austin-based $13 billion utility company. Jackson was responsible for operations, public and community affairs at AEP subsidiaries, Central Power and Light Company and West Texas Utilities Company for the next three years.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Central+and+South+West+Corporation+Announces+Structural,+Leadership...-a020166781 =Return to public sector= With a new Republican administration in the White House, Jackson was a likely contender for a federal appointment, especially since he had known George W. Bush, the Texas governor declared the winner of the 2000 presidential election, since 1989, when both lived in the same Dallas neighborhood. In early 2001 Jackson's name was approved by Congress to serve as the deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a post that essentially made him second-in-command and chief operating officer of the cabinet department, working under HUD Secretary Mel Martinez.Brennan, Carol. \\"Jackson, Alphonso R.\\" Contemporary Black Biography. 2005.

Hampton University's Center for Public Policy focuses on making its university research relevant to real-world problems. No other Historically Black University houses such a center. =Current career= In 2012, Jackson became Vice-Chairman of Consumer & Community Banking with JPMorgan Chase in New York City. Affiliations An expert on public housing and urban issues, Jackson has been asked to serve on a number of national and state commissions, most notably the General Services Commission of the State of Texas, where he served as Chairman; the National Commission on America's Urban Families, and the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing. He has served on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, The Nature Conservancy of Texas, Vice Chairman of United Way Campaign(Dallas, Texas), Zale-Lipshy University Hospital, The Cotton Bowl Football Classic, Central Power & Light Company, West Texas Utilities and JPMorgan Chase (formerly Texas Commerce Bank).

As Deputy Secretary, Jackson managed the day-to-day operations of HUD, which had an annual budget of over $30 billion. After HUD Secretary Mel Martinez left the administration to campaign for the November 2004 election for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, Jackson became acting secretary of HUD. He was nominated by President George W. Bush on January 28, 2004 to take that position on a permanent basis, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on March 31, 2004. Jackson was the fourth African American to hold that post. On March 31, 2008, Jackson announced his resignation, effective April 18, 2008. = HUD Removal from High Risk List = For the first time in thirteen years, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) removed HUD from the government's \\" high-risk\\" list. GAO's report recognized HUD's progress under Secretary Alphonso Jackson's leadership in implementing management controls that led to significant improvements to HUD departments and programs. Jackson stated, \\" HUD serves the nation best when all its programs are working effectively and efficiently. GAO's removal of a high risk designation shines a bright light on our efforts over the past six years to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and well.\\"'GAO RECOGNIZES HUD'S MANAGEMENT REFORMS, First time in 13 years no HUD programs on GAO's ‚ÄúHigh-Risk‚Äù list\\" = Reduction in homelessness = During Jackson's tenure at HUD, HUD announced an 11.5% reduction in the number of persons reported as chronically homeless by Continuums of Care (CoCs) during a one-day count. Over 1,500 cities and counties reported a combined decrease of over 20,000 fewer chronically homeless persons between 2005 and 2006.\\"HUD Secretary Jackson Announces Reduction in Chronic Homelessness\\", November 7, 2007 One important tool in this effort was HUD's first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter at least once in a three-month period. Through the data collection for the report, and the subsequent analysis of that data, HUD learned a great deal about the demographics of homelessness. Prior to the report, according to Jackson, HUD had a hard time figuring out if national or local programs were working and a tough time just trying to figure out where the homeless might be on a given night. \\"Prepared Remarks for Alphonso Jackson Secretary of Housing and Urban Development at the Press Conference about Chronic Homelessness\\" =Increase in minority contracting= Jackson increased minority, women and small business contracting substantially during his tenure. In 2003, the year before Jackson was named secretary, 14 percent‚Äîor $134 million‚Äîof the Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs contracts went to black-owned firms, officials say. By 2007, black-owned businesses were receiving 25 percent of the department‚Äôs contracts, or $195.6 million. Jackson promoted such statistics, saying that ‚Äúa good bottom line with small and minority businesses helps to build a stronger America.‚Äù This accomplishment led to a federal investigation and caused some to think Jackson was wrongly targeted because of his efforts. Indeed, some of his supporters deride the scrutiny of his casual friendships as a racist effort to undermine a prominent black official and several respected black businessmen, noting that no one has been charged with a crime. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said he believed the investigation was fueled by officials determined to derail Jackson‚Äôs efforts to expand affirmative action. ‚ÄúIs there something wrong with trying to make sure African-Americans participate in the contracting program with the American government?‚Äù asked Mr. Clyburn. On April 30, 2010 the Justice Department announced it would not be pursuing charges against Jackson.

Cabrera that suggested that HUD leadership sought to punish Carl R. Greene, the director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA). On the date these e-mails were sent, HUD notified the housing authority that it had been found in violation of rules requiring that 5 percent of housing be accessible to disabled residents. The department later argued that because the authority refused to acknowledge it was in violation and to agree to a specific remedy, it was in violation of a broader agreement that put $50 million in federal funding in jeopardy. Greene, who later was forced to resign from the Philadelphia Housing Authority due to numerous accusations of wrongdoings, asserted that the HUD actions were in retaliation against PHA because Greene had refused to turn over property to Universal Community Homes, a development company founded by Kenny Gamble; Greene said that Universal had not performed as promised. Gamble complained to Jackson about the situation in 2006.Leonnig, Carol D. \\"HUD E-Mails Refer to Retaliation\\", Washington Post, March 12, 2008.\\"Former Housing and Urban Development director 'not surprised' by Carl Greene's troubles\\" August 26, 2010By John Shiffman, Inquirer Staff Writer A federal judge later ruled for HUD, that Jackson did not treat Philadelphia differently than other local housing agencies.

He recounted that a prospective HUD contractor had made a \\"heck of a proposal\\" and was selected upon the basis of that proposal, but upon thanking Jackson for being selected the bidder, mentioned that he did not like President Bush. As a result, Jackson said, the bidder who had criticized Bush did not receive the contract: \\"Brother, you have a disconnect‚Äîthe President is elected, I was selected. You wouldn‚Äôt be getting the contract unless I was sitting here. If you have a problem with the President, don‚Äôt tell the secretary.\\" Jackson told the crowd, \\"He didn't get the contract.

It consists of a command-line environment that developers may integrate into their build processes to build MSI and MSM packages. WiX was the first Microsoft project to be released under an open-source license, the Common Public License. It was also the first Microsoft project to be hosted on an external website. After its release in 2004, Microsoft has used WiX to package Office 2007, SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005/2008, and other products. WiX includes Votive, a Visual Studio add-in that allows creating and building WiX setup projects using the Visual Studio IDE. Votive supports syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for \`.wxs\` source files and adds a WiX setup project type \`.wixproj\` to Visual Studio. Tools =Candle= Candle compiles the XML documents to \`.wixobj\` object files that contain symbols and references to symbols. =Light= Light takes one or more object files and links the references in the object files to the appropriate symbols in other object files. Light is responsible for collecting all of the binaries, packaging them appropriately, and generating the final MSI or MSM file. =Lit= Lit combines multiple object files into a library for convenience. =Dark= Dark takes existing MSI and MSM files and generates XML documents that represent the package. =Heat= Heat creates WiX file list code from a file, directory, Visual Studio project, website, VB6 COM component, performance counter category, or Registry file. It produces a \`.wxs\` file that can be compiled and linked with other \`.wxs\` files. WiX 3.0's Heat replaced WiX 2.0's more limited Tallow tool. There is also a third-party tool called Paraffin, available under the Common Public License, which offers several features not present in Heat. In particular, Paraffin can keep the GUIDs assigned to each file the same even when the tool is run multiple times. Paraffin can also exclude files by extension or regular expression. =Pyro= Pyro creates Patch files (msp) without the Windows Installer SDK. =Burn= Burn is a prerequisite bootstrapper and installer chainer tool, was first released in version 3.6. Features include small size, proper elevation support for Windows Vista and Windows 7, a very customizable UI and progress indicators, and automatic download of required dependencies. The old Burn source code was abandoned in July 2009 and reimplemented based on NETFX4 bootstrapper. History WiX was the first Microsoft project to be released under an open- source license, the Common Public License. Initially hosted on SourceForge, it was also the first Microsoft project to be hosted externally. Rob Mensching, the original author and lead developer of WiX, works on WiX in his spare time. When he released the first version of WiX on April 5, 2004, he commented, \\"I did not feel that many people inside Microsoft understood what the Open Source community was really about and I wanted to improve that understanding by providing an example.\\" As of 2006, several other Microsoft employees from various product divisions of the company worked on WiX with Mensching, meeting after business hours once a week to coordinate development efforts and write code. WiX version 2.0 was released in 2007. WiX version 3.0 was released July 4, 2009. On June 6, 2010, WiX moved from SourceForge to CodePlex. WiX version 3.5 was released January 31, 2011. On August 14, 2012, Microsoft transferred the WiX copyright to the Microsoft-sponsored Outercurve Foundation. At the same time, the license was changed from the Common Public License to the Microsoft Reciprocal License. WiX version 3.6 was released September 3, 2012 and has a focus on Burn. WiX version 3.7 was released December 24, 2012. Version 3.7 supports Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012. WiX version 3.8 was released November 28, 2013. Visual Studio 2013 support is one of the major new features. WiX version 3.9 was released October 31, 2014. WiX version 3.10 was released September 3, 2015.

Anthony (AP-72) was a turbo-electric ocean liner, Santa Clara, of the Grace Steamship Company that was built in 1930. Santa Clara was turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 28 February 1942 and operated by Grace Lines as agent for WSA as a troop ship making voyages to the South Pacific. The ship was chartered to the Navy on 7 August 1942 for operation as a United States Navy transport ship. The ship was sunk 7 June 1944 off Normandy by a mine while cruising through a swept channel with all 2,689 people aboard being saved. Building and civilian service The New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey completed the ship in March 1930 and named her the SS Santa Clara. Santa Clara had six water tube boilers with a combined heating surface of and a working pressure of 300 lbf/in2. Santa Clara was turbo-electric: her boilers supplied steam to two turbo generators which fed current to electric motors connected to her twin propeller shafts. General Electric made her turbo generators and propulsion motors, and her power output was rated at 2,660 NHP Santa Clara gave more than a decade of civilian service. Notable passengers included Walt Disney and his staff in 1941 had been in Chile researching for their film The Three Caballeros. They left Valpara√≠so on the Santa Clara on 4 October and reached New York on 20 October. World War II On 28 February 1942 Santa Clara was delivered at New York to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) by Grace Lines with that line operating the ship as a WSA transport allocated to Army transportation requirements under a general agency agreement. On 11 March the agreement terms were changed to bareboat charter by WSA. =WSA troopship= The ship was converted from commercial configuration by Robins Dry Dock & Repair Company in New York in late February. During this period Santa Clara is shown as being in the Pacific and in at least one large convoy, BT-201, departing New York on 4 March and arriving Brisbane on 6 April 1942. During that voyage the ship had stopped at Bora Bora on the way to Australia and Melbourne, Townsville and Wellington before returning to San Francisco on 11 May 1942. Santa Clara returned to the South Pacific departing San Francisco on 26 May destined for Auckland and Bora Bora before crossing the Pacific to Buenaventura, Colombia and then transiting the Panama Canal on 9 July bound for New York. On 7 August 1942 Santa Clara was delivered to the Navy at New York on a sub bareboat charter basis. =Navy service= After delivery to the Navy Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's New York yard converted Santa Clara for Navy troop transport service. The Navy renamed the ship after the women's suffrage and women's rights campaigner Susan B. Anthony, making her one of the few Naval vessels named after a woman. She was commissioned on 7 September 1942 as USS Susan B. Anthony, with the designation AP-72, under the command of Captain Henry Hartley. Invasion of North Africa, 1942 After almost a month of drills and exercises in the lower Chesapeake Bay, the transport ‚Äî carrying troops and equipment ‚Äî left the bay on 23 October for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa. At the end of a 15-day crossing, she reached the transport area off Mehdia, French Morocco. Early the next morning, on 8 November, the Northern Attack Group opened the assault on Mehdia and Port Lyautey. Despite the general difficulties encountered in handling landing craft, she disembarked her troops and unloaded their equipment in relatively good order. She stayed in the area for a week before sailing on the 15th for Safi, Morocco to unload the rest of her cargo. On 18 November she left Safi for Norfolk, Virginia, and arrived at Hampton Roads on the last day of the month. Over the next seven months Susan B. Anthony made three voyages bringing troops and supplies across the Atlantic to North Africa; the first to Casablanca and the remainder to Oran, Algeria. Invasion of Sicily, 1943 After a brief voyage to the Gulf of Arzeu ferrying men and equipment, she returned to Oran on 25 June 1943 to prepare for the Allied invasion of Sicily. She embarked men and loaded material on 30 June-1 July, refueled on the 2nd, and left Oran three days later. Anthony approached the coast of Sicily on the 9th near the town of Scoglitti. She spent the early hours of the next day landing troops and equipment. By 0435 hrs enemy aircraft were attacking the ships of the assault force. Bombs fell close to Anthony but she emerged with only minor damage from bomb fragments. Just before 0600 hrs she started toward the inshore anchorage, but withdrew after shore batteries fired on her. About four hours later she was able to enter the anchorage and send her salvage crew to aid broached and disabled landing craft. Through that day and the next she came under repeated air attacks. Just after 2200 hrs on the 11th a twin-engine plane commenced an attack run at her, but by the time it had closed within , her anti-aircraft guns had shot it down in flames. Less than 10 minutes later another enemy bomber met a similar fate. Late in the afternoon of 12 July Susan B. Anthony left for Oran. There she loaded prisoners; sailed for the US; and reached New York on 3 August 1943. Atlantic convoys, 1943‚Äì44 For the next 10 months Anthony crossed and recrossed the Atlantic moving soldiers and cargo between various ports in the US, England, Iceland, Northern Ireland and Scotland in preparation for Operation Overlord, the cross-channel invasion of Europe at Normandy. On these voyages she visited ports including Belfast, Northern Ireland; Holy Loch, Gourock, and Glasgow in Scotland; Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur and Reykjav√≠k, Iceland; Mumbles and Milford Haven in Wales, and Newport. Sinking off Normandy, 7 June 1944 multibeam image of the wreck in 2003 Early in the morning of 7 June 1944, while transporting soldiers of the 90th Infantry Division through a swept channel off Normandy en route to Utah Beach, Susan B. Anthony struck a mine that exploded under her number 4 hold. Immediately she lost all power, and her rudder went hard left and stuck. By 0805 hrs, holds numbers 4 and 5 were shipping water badly, and the ship took on an 8¬∞ list to starboard. In an effort to save his ship, the commanding officer, Commander TL Gray, USNR, ordered the embarked soldiers to move to the port side. This human ballast soon brought Anthony back to an even keel. At 0822 hrs fleet tug came alongside, prepared to tow the paralyzed Anthony to shallow water. However, fires soon erupted in her engine and fire rooms, and she began to settle more rapidly. The captain now concluded that the ship was lost and ordered her abandoned. With Pinto and two destroyers alongside, the troops were evacuated expeditiously and without resorting to lifeboats and rafts. Anthonys crew followed closely behind the soldiers. By 0905 hrs, the main deck was awash at the stern and she was listing badly. The last member of the salvage crew hit the water at about 1000 hrs, with Commander Gray soon following. At 1010 hrs Susan B. Anthony sank about 10 miles (16 km) from the French coast at a depth of 70 feet (20 m). No one was killed, and few of the 45 wounded were seriously hurt. All 2,689 people aboard were saved, which the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the largest rescue of people without loss of life. Samuel Tankersley Williams, then a brigadier general serving as assistant division commander of the 90th Infantry Division, received the Soldier's Medal for non- combat heroism in recognition of his efforts to evacuate the ship. Even though he didn't know how to swim, Williams personally braved smoke, heat, and flames to search the ship and ensure that no one was left behind. Susan B. Anthony was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1944. Honors Susan B. Anthony was awarded three service stars for World War II service.

Services are provided by London Overground, who manage the station, along with Southern and London Underground. It is in Travelcard Zone 2. On the Underground it is the terminus of a short District line branch from , originally built as part of the Middle Circle. On the main-line railway it is on the West London Line from to , by which trains bypass central London. The station's name is drawn from its location in Kensington and the adjacent Olympia exhibition centre. The station was originally opened in 1844 by the West London Railway but closed shortly afterwards. It reopened in 1862 and began catering for Great Western services the following year. In 1872 it became part of the Middle Circle train route that bypassed central London. The station was bombed during World War II and subsequently closed. It reopened in 1946 but the limited service to Clapham Junction was recommended for withdrawal in the 1960s Beeching Report. The main-line station was revitalised later in the decade as a terminus for national Motorail, and upgraded again in 1986 to serve a wider range of InterCity destinations. The station's Underground connection after World War II was limited to a shuttle service to and from Earl's Court. Since 2011 this service has only run at weekends with occasional exceptions when there is an exhibition at Olympia. Name and location View of Olympia from the station In 1863, with the opening of the West London Extension Railway, a station named Kensington was opened north of the junction with the West London Railway, but when several underground lines opened stations at High Street Kensington and West Kensington, the station name was changed to Addison Road to avoid any confusion. The station appears as Kensington Olympia on the National Rail website and on some of its maps and timetables. On London Underground and London Overground maps, station signage and the London Rail & Tube Services map, it is labelled Kensington (Olympia). On the automated announcements and the dot matrix indicators on District line trains, the station is shown as simply Olympia. The station is located alongside the namesake Olympia exhibition centre. The boundary between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham here runs parallel to and immediately to the west of the railway line. The platforms are accessed via Russell Road from the east and Olympia Way from the west. A footbridge connects the two roads, and is segregated so it is possible to walk directly from Russell Road to Olympia Way without having to pass through any ticket barriers. Platform 1 serves the part-time District line services towards High Street Kensington via Earl's Court, platform 2 serves Overground trains towards Willsden, and platform 3 runs towards Clapham Junction. London Buses routes 9, 23, 27, 28, 49, 391, C1; night routes N9, N28 and Green Line Coaches services 701 and 702 call at and pass the station. History =Opening= A 1911 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Kensington Olympia (lower centre, indicated as \\"Addison Road\\") A station called Kensington was opened by the West London Railway as its southern terminus on 27 May 1844, located just south of Hammersmith Road. The line was not popular and it was closed on 1 December that year due to the losses made. A scant and erratic goods service continued. The line was re-opened to passengers on 2 June 1862 as part of the West London Extension Railway with a new station, also called Kensington, to the north of Hammersmith Road, providing services to and . Great Western Railway trains started serving the station in 1863, with London & North Western Railway trains arriving in 1872. A link to the Hammersmith & City Railway enabled the station to join the Middle Circle service, which operated via Paddington to the north and South Kensington to the south. In 1868 the station was renamed Kensington Addison Road. From 1869 the London & South Western Railway operated trains from Richmond to London Waterloo via Addison Road, until their branch via Shepherd's Bush closed in 1916. By 1907 the Middle Circle had been replaced by a link to Hammersmith. The station appears on the first 'London Underground' map in 1908 with Metropolitan and District Railway services. There was an Express Dairies creamery and milk bottling plant close to the station. It was served by milk trains running from the Great Western Railway at Old Oak Common to a siding adjacent to the station. =Decline= alt= In 1940 Addison Road and the link to the Metropolitan line at Latimer Road closed along with the other West London Line stations after the line was bombed, and it was not considered cost-effective to rebuild by the London Passenger Transport Board. Due to its ability to access all lines radiating from London, its close location to SHAEF headquarters and its relative quietness compared to the main London termini, it was the preferred embarkation point for US Army General Dwight D. Eisenhower when he visited troops in Wales preparing for the June 1944 Normandy landings. On 19 December 1946 the station was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and became the northern terminus of a peak-hour shuttle service to Clapham Junction, serving workers at the Post Office Savings Bank (later National Savings Bank) in nearby Blythe Road. Until 1986, apart from Motorail services, this was the only British Rail service regularly stopping at the station. It was known as the \\"Kenny Belle\\" and was unadvertised, reportedly because the Post Office Savings Bank was under the Official Secrets Act. There was also a District line shuttle to Earl's Court, as the station had been left without a dedicated Underground connection. The service originally only ran when there was an exhibition at the centre, but a permanent platform opened on 3 March 1958. The station was sometimes used as a terminus during reconstruction and upgrading of mainline London terminal stations. =Cold War= Kensington (Olympia) was included in 1960s Cold War plans to ensure continuity of government in the event of hostilities. Secret plans entailed use of the station, in the prelude to a nuclear war, to evacuate several thousand civil servants to the Central Government War Headquarters underground bunker (codenamed \\"Burlington\\") in Wiltshire.U.K. Government War Book 1962 National Archives Reference CAB 175/13. Civil servants tasked with manning the facility would have been directed to join trains at this station, chosen since the West London Line connected to the Great Western Main Line (and hence Wiltshire) at North Pole Junction, to the north. These trains would have connected with buses at Warminster for further transfer to the bunker near Corsham.Government War Book (1962), volume 2, Appendix B. Available at the National Archives as CAB 175/13 =Motorail= alt= In 1966 Kensington (Olympia) became the main London terminus for British Rail Motorail trains, which carried passengers and vehicles across Britain. In the London Midland Region timetable for 1970‚Äì71, services are shown to Perth, Stirling, Carlisle, St Austell, Totnes, Newton Abbot and Fishguard (connecting with the ferry for Rosslare).London Midland Passenger Timetable 4 May 1970 ‚Äì 2 May 1971, pp.51‚Äì53. This facility closed in 1981 with operations transferred to Paddington, Euston and King's Cross.\\"In brief\\" Railway Gazette International January 1982 page 20 The car park for the service is now used for exhibition vehicles, and by Europcar for car rental, and is called \\"Olympia Motorail Car Park P4\\". =Revival= A former bay platform is now Olympia Garden with 89 vegetable plots. From 12 May 1986 services at the station were greatly enhanced. The London Underground shuttle service started to run to a regular daily schedule, and inter-regional services from the Midlands and northern England stopped at Kensington (Olympia). Southern Region destinations included and . As part of this the footbridge was painted in InterCity colours. These trains were operated by the InterCity division of British Rail and later, after privatisation, by Virgin CrossCountry and CrossCountry. Destinations included , , , and . The services were withdrawn in October 2008, by which time only two daily Brighton‚ÄìManchester journeys were operated. The station was part of the London Station Group, accepting \\"London Terminals\\" tickets, until it was delisted in May 1994. The same year, a full passenger service between Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction was reinstated after a gap of 54 years. There were two bay platforms on the south-eastern side, mainly used by services to/from Clapham Junction. These platforms were removed in 1983 and the track was lifted; the space was used for an additional car park for the exhibition centre. One of the former platforms is now Olympia Garden, a community garden with 89 vegetable plots. Before the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was proposed in 1996, Kensington (Olympia) was planned to be expanded to accommodate a car terminal for international services. The line would have run via the West London and South Eastern Main Lines to before entering the tunnel. Before Eurostar transferred in November 2007 to St Pancras International, Eurostar trains passed through the station between Waterloo International station and North Pole depot, and the station was a backup terminus for the services in case Waterloo International became unusable; immigration facilities were maintained there. In June 2011, Transport for London (TfL) announced that the District line shuttle between Kensington (Olympia) and Earl's Court would close on weekdays at the end of the year. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea unsuccessfully protested against the closure, and general weekday services ceased in December 2011. Some special weekday services continue to run on the District line when there is an exhibition on. In 2012 TfL announced plans to introduce ticket gates at the station to combat fare dodgers, which would remove access to the footbridge used by local residents for years. Both the councils within whose boundaries this station falls challenged this loss of an established right of way. The plan was abandoned the following year. Services =National Rail= London Overground Class 378 at Kensington Olympia The station is on the West London line of the London Overground network, which is signed by Transport for London as the \\"Willesden Junction ‚Äì Clapham Junction\\" line.

The festival was held annually from 1959 to 1969, barring two years of inactivity in 1961 and 1962. Following a 16-year hiatus, the festival returned to Newport in 1985, and it has been held at Fort Adams State Park annually since then. History =Founding= The Newport Folk Festival was founded in 1959 by George Wein, founder of the already-well-established Newport Jazz Festival, and owner of Storyville, a jazz club located in Boston, MA. In 1958, Wein became aware of the growing Folk Revival movement and began inviting folk artists such as Odetta to perform on Sunday afternoons at Storyville. The afternoon performances consistently sold out and Wein began to consider the possibility of a \\"folk afternoon embedded within the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival\\". Wein envisioned the program to be \\"similar in scope and tone to the highly successful blues and gospel shows\\" that had taken place at the Jazz Festival in previous years. Wein asked Odetta, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers to perform on the afternoon in addition to the Kingston Trio. After conferring with the folk community, it grew abundantly clear to Wein that an afternoon program would not suffice and that there was demand for a full festival. Aware of his own limitations in the folk scene, Wein asked Albert Grossman, then Odetta's manager, to join him in planning and producing the festival. Grossman accepted and began working with Wein to book talent and organize the weekend. Pete Seeger was also involved with the founding of the festival. The inaugural festival lineup included Pete Seeger, Earl Scruggs, the Kingston Trio, John Jacob Niles, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Odetta, The New Lost City Ramblers, and more. Perhaps the most notable performance was the surprise debut of the eighteen year old Joan Baez, who was brought on as a guest of Bob Gibson. The festival returned in 1960 and was expanded to include three nights. The lineup placed an emphasis on music diversity, booking performers from Africa, Scotland, Spain, Israel, and Ireland alongside \\"traditional\\" folk musicians such as Pete Seeger, Ewan McColl, John Lee Hooker, Cisco Houston and Tommy Makem. =Civil Rights Movement= In 1962, two young members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) formed a gospel vocal quartet named the Freedom Singers. And in 1962, Pete and Toshi Seeger assisted the Freedom Singers in organizing a nationwide collegiate tour. As a result, the civil rights movement became deeply embraced by the folk music community. In 1963, the Freedom Singers performed on the first night of the Newport Folk festival, and on the second night Joan Baez joined SNCC activists and roughly 600 festival-goers on a march through Newport. The crowd walked past the Bellevue Avenue mansions and into Touro Park, where SNCC's executive secretary James Forman and Freedom Singers leader Cordell Reagon delivered speeches, rallying support for the March on Washington scheduled for the following March. For the final performance on Friday Wein had scheduled Peter, Paul and Mary. But under the persuasion of Albert Grossman, who was managing Peter, Paul and Mary, Wein decided to allow Bob Dylan (whom Grossman was also managing) to close the night. After Peter, Paul and Mary finished their afternoon set, Wein announced that they would reappear at the end of the evening. Dylan performed a set consisting of particularly topical songs: \\"With God on Our Side\\", \\"Talkin' John Birch Society Blues\\", and \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\\". Peter, Paul and Mary then returned and performed an encore of \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\". Amidst a \\"deafening roar of applause\\" they brought to the stage Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Theo Bikel and the Freedom Singers. The singers stood in a single line facing the audience with crossed arms and clasped hands and began to sing a variation on the Baptist hymn \\"I'll Overcome Some Day\\". The hymn's new incarnation - \\"We Shall Overcome\\" - had become an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement. =Revival of Mississippi John Hurt= In 1928, Mississippi John Hurt, a self-taught amateur musician and farmer, recorded 13 songs for Okeh Records which failed to achieve commercial success. Believing his musical career to be over, Hurt continued farming, apparently thinking little of his brief recording gig. Post WWII, few records cut by southern musicians in the 1920s were commercially available. Hurt's records were particularly rare, since few had been manufactured in the first place. But Harry Smith, a member of a tiny subculture of obsessive, cranky collectors, put two John Hurt cuts on his influential 1952 Anthology of American Folk Music, prompting many blues hobbyists to begin searching for him. In 1963, Tom Hoskins and Mike Stewart acquired a tape of Hurt's Avalon Blues through their informal network of tape traders. Hurt had recorded Avalon Blues at the end of a week-long stay in New York that spanned Christmas 1928. Apparently homesick in the big city, Hurt included a line about his home in Avalon being always on his mind. Hoskins and Stewart were able to locate Avalon and track Hurt down. After asking Hurt to perform, to ensure he was actually who he claimed to be, Hoskins convinced Hurt to move to Washington D.C. and embark on a national tour. The tour culminated on Saturday evening of the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, when Mississippi John Hurt performed alongside Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry and John Lee Hooker for a blues workshop at the Newport Casino. The performance is considered to be a seminal moment for the folk revival and caused Hurt to rise to fame. He performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. =The Electric Dylan controversy= Bob Dylan's 1963 and 1964 performances solo and with Baez had made him popular with the Newport crowd, but on July 25, 1965 festival headliner Dylan was booed by some fans when he played with backing band The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. It is usually said that the reason for the hostile reception by a small number of fans was Dylan's \\"abandoning\\" of the folk orthodoxy, or poor sound quality on the night (or a combination of the two). The controversy regarding the reaction of the audience at this event is often overplayed, as it was not the general reaction of the audience, but rather that of a small number of folk \\"purists\\", including Pete Seeger. The reaction of \\"the crowd\\" to Dylan's performance, certainly from eyewitness accounts, was generally quite enthusiastic. This performance, Dylan's first live \\"plugged-in\\" set of his professional career, marked the shift in his artistic direction from folk to rock, and had wider implications for both genres. The performance marked the first time Dylan performed \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" in public. Despite the musical transition, Dylan's growing status within the larger counterculture ensured that his place in the expanding movement would remain secure. Dylan did not return to Newport until 2002, when he played a headlining performance while wearing a wig and fake beard. =Johnny Cash Introduces Kris Kristofferson= In 1969, the Johnny Cash troupe was to perform on opening night of the festival. Cash had recently become aware of Kris Kristofferson, a young, relatively unknown country singer-songwriter, and convinced George Wein to allow Kristofferson to join him onstage. Kristofferson's performance of \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" and other songs gave him a launch into his legendary musical career. The 1969 festival also included the debut festival performance of James Taylor, who performed \\"Carolina in My Mind\\" to a standing ovation during a \\"young performers\\" showcase. However, Taylor only performed for 15 minutes before Wein ended the festival early with the announcement of that Apollo 11 had landed on the Moon. =End of Folk Festival, hiatus and return= The Folk Festival did not return to Newport in 1970, due to financial issues and local controversies involving the Newport Jazz Festival. Following a riot at the jazz festival in 1971, Wein deactivated both events. Wein reestablished the Newport Jazz Festival in 1981, and the folk festival returned to town in 1985. =Michelle Shocked V-J Day Protest= The Newport Folk Festival has, throughout various points in its history, remained connected to protest movements. In the 60's the festival played a substantial part in the civil rights movement. In the early 80's the Newport Folk Festival was one of the first festivals to serve as a platform for climate change protest. In the 1990s, playing on Victory Day (originally \\"Victory over Japan Day\\" or \\"V-J Day\\") folk musician Michelle Shocked asked the entire audience to lie down because \\"she wanted to see what it looked like when people had been destroyed by bombs\\". This was relevant to the locale of the festival as Rhode Island is the only US state which still officially celebrates the holiday, and the Naval War College is also in Newport, a mere few miles from the Fort Adams State Park where the festival is held. =Return of Bob Dylan= In 2002, Bob Dylan returned to the Newport Folk Festival for the first time since his shocking performance in 1965, in which he went electric. The '65 appearance at the Folk Festival was a turning point in his career, a distancing of himself from his acoustic folk music to his more blues-based electric music. Despite wide speculation that Dylan would once again attempt to \\"shock\\" the audience at Newport, Dylan performed a straightforward set, with few surprises aside from his adoption of a wig and fake beard. The performance was reviewed favorably and provided a much-needed economic boost to the festival. Dylan has not returned to the Folk Festival since this 2002 performance, but festival organizer Jay Sweet told The Providence Journal in 2016 that Dylan has a standing invitation to play the festival anytime he wants. =Pixies Go Acoustic= Initially spanning the late eighties and early nineties, The Pixies are often credited for creating a blueprint for alternative rock that was followed and embellished upon by numerous contemporary indie/rock artists. After separating in 1994, the group reunited in 2004 and in 2005, performed, for the first time, a completely acoustic performance at the Newport Folk Festival. The set was deemed \\"Pixies Go Acoustic\\" as a play on words in reference to Bob Dylan going electric at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. The performance was recorded and turned into a feature film directed by Michael B Borofsky, titled Pixies: Acoustic: Live in Newport. =Establishment of Foundation= The Newport Folk Festival has existed in various forms since its creation; founded as a not-for-profit, the festival became a for-profit in the mid-eighties. However, in 2011, the festival announced it would return to its non-profit status under the umbrella of the Newport Festivals Foundation. The Foundation not only strived to sustain the Newport Folk and Newport Jazz Festival, but also expand the impact of its Festivals through educational initiatives that celebrate innovation while preserving the deep traditions inherent in Jazz and Folk music. Newport Festivals Foundation, retrieved January 10, 2017 =Turning Point/50th Celebration= In 2008, Executive Producer, George Wein hired Jay Sweet as an associate of the festival. At the time, the folk festival was struggling financially and with Sweet's recommendations, the 2008 line-up varied drastically from previous years. Rock band the Black Crowes and Trey Anastasio, frontman of Phish, headlined and other artists on the bill included Stephen Marley and Damian Marley, sons of reggae icon Bob Marley. The Festival was well attended and received favorable press, despite folk purists questioning the modernization of the festival. Sweet continued his unconventional and somewhat controversial style of booking artists that challenged the conservative definitions of folk music. With 2009 being the 50th anniversary of the festival, Sweet used the opportunity to book both modern and traditional folk acts; symbolizing the past and current styles of folk music. The success of the 2009 festival marked a turning point in the festival's history. In 2011 the two day festival sold out Saturday and in 2012 the festival sold out both days. In 2013 the festival expanded to three days and sold out both Saturday and Sunday. In 2014 the festival sold out all three days months in advance. The festival has sold out every year since. =65 Revisited= In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Bob Dylan going electric at Newport, the Festival scheduled a program titled 65 Revisited on the final night of the 2015 festival. The program's details and performers were kept secret prior to the performance - prompting various rumors including the return of Bob Dylan. Instead, the program featured an array of more contemporary musicians, including Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Willie Watson, Hozier and Klara Soderberg of First Aid Kit, John McCauley and Ian O'Neil of Deer Tick, Robyn Hitchcock and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band of New Orleans. The ensemble performed a collection of Dylan's material, ending the performance with \\"Rainy Day Women #12 and 35,\\". Programming style In recent years, the Newport Folk Festival has developed a reputation for selling out of tickets before announcing the lineup. Unlike most festivals, the festival \\"rolls out\\" their lineup over the course of the year instead of releasing a lineup poster on one day. The festival has also developed a reputation for programming surprise, unannounced artists. Past instances include the 65 Revisited program (2015), in which Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, Dawes, and Willie Watson appeared unannounced. Other surprise moments include My Morning Jacket (2015), James Taylor (2015), Kris Kristofferson (2016), Roger Waters (2017), Mumford & Sons (2018) and Dolly Parton (2019). Like 65 Revisited in 2015, 2018's A Change Is Gonna Come closing set paired guests from the weekend with unannounced guests including Leon Bridges, Chris Thile, and Mavis Staples.Providence Journal. July 29, 2018 Review Songs of Change As Newport Folk Festival Concludes Setting The Newport Folk Festival takes place every year at Fort Adams State Park, in Newport, Rhode Island. Fort Adams houses four stages, the Fort Stage which sits looking out at Newport harbor and the famous Claiborne Pell Bridge, the Harbor Stage, The Quad Stage, and The Museum Stage. The festival is known for its beautiful setting- as the music blog Consequence of Sound puts it, \\"Located at the gorgeously scenic Fort Adams, in Newport, Rhode Island, glimmering, clear blue water surrounds the small vivid green peninsula. Look out from the fort towers and you'll see hundreds of beautiful boats rocking along the water.\\" (Consequence of Sound). My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James told Spin Magazine, \\"You've got the sun on your skin and the breeze in your hair. It's magical here... It's just magical.\\" (SPIN at Newport Folk 2010) Brandi Carlile says \\"It's one of my favorites so far if not my favorite.\\" (Brandi Carlile Interview) WMVY began streaming the festival in 2005 and was joined by NPR Music in 2008. WMVY's Archives contains both performances and interviews from Newport Folk and NPR music has recorded sets available for listening here: NPR at Newport Folk 2010. Sustainability The festival has made efforts in being green-friendly, teaming with many groups to do so. They partnered with Clean Water Action and Rhode Island Resource Recovery to collect 1.5 tons of recyclables. CWA worked onsite picking up trash and recycling, and set up composting stations to curb the waste generated during the event. A portion of beer and wine sales went to CWA to support their work. The official beer of the festival, Vermont-based Magic Hat used plant-based, 100% compostable cups. The festival also partnered with CLIF Bar, who set up a bike valet to encourage people to cycle to the event and participate in their 2-Mile Challenge. They worked with New England Wind Fund to offset power used during the festival, and Klean Kanteen to provide reusable water bottles. They also partnered with Farm Fresh Rhode Island to incorporate local foods into the vendors' fare.

After remaining unpublished for years, the novel was published online in 2002, hosted by Kuro5hin; Williams later published a print edition via print-on-demand publisher Lulu. One reviewer called the novel \\"a well-written and very creative, if flawed, piece of work\\" and ranked it as one of the more important works of fiction to deal with the idea of a technological singularity. Publishing history Roger Williams started writing The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect in 1982, while studying at college. After writing a basic plot outline, Williams realized that he \\"had no clue how to end it\\", and thus put it to one side for over a decade. In 1994, with the initial plot outline now lost, Williams claims to have had an unusually vivid dream which compelled him to start writing‚Äîresulting in the completion of the first chapter. This continued intermittently, with each chapter resulting from a burst of inspiration, culminating when the final chapter‚Äîthe ending‚Äîwas written approximately a year after the first. As Williams describes it, the actual writing time was about 14 days in total. At this point, Williams showed it to a few friends, but otherwise claims to have made no serious attempt to publish the work. This differs, however, from Henrik Ingo's account, as he states that Williams made \\"numerous attempts\\" to find a publisher. In 2002, Williams was writing articles for Kuro5hin, and was encouraged to publish it there. Thus it was finally published approximately eight years after completion. It was published online under a copyright scheme that permits free distribution and printing of the electronic version of the novel, but prohibits distribution of printed copies of the work. Printed versions were later made available by the author through Lulu.com, who provide print-on-demand services. While the online version was free, Williams provided a PayPal tip jar, which had raised $750 US by April 2003. This is considerably under the typical advance paid to authors, and led Williams to describe internet tip jars as an insufficient model for authors hoping to pay for \\"the rent and groceries\\". Nevertheless, Williams was happy with his success. Plot The story of the novella explores the nature of human desire and the uses and abuses of technology in the satisfaction of desire. The story begins after \\"the Change\\", in a dream-like post-scarcity society, approximately six hundred years in the future, in which humans have godlike control over their environments, made possible by the supercomputer called Prime Intellect. Prime Intellect operates under Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics, according to its own interpretation, which allows temporary voluntary harm and discomfort. PI has made humanity immortal and satisfies nearly every whim. Caroline, the thirty-seventh oldest living human being, who engages in a sport known as \\"death jockeying\\", whose players die elaborately and painfully for sport, only to be resurrected by Prime Intellect. Flashbacks set before the Change show the creation of Prime Intellect by Lawrence, a technologist, and its realization of its power, and the past life of Caroline before and after the Change, which happened not gradually but rapidly. In the present, Caroline, makes use of a \\"Death Contract\\", an understanding between a person and Prime Intellect that the person is not to be removed from danger until the instant of death, at which point the person is fully restored. Caroline makes use of a Death Contract, and her own powers of persuasion, in order to trick a pre- Change enemy into torturing herself into psychosis, as an act of revenge. After learning that Prime Intellect had destroyed distant alien life as a possible threat to humanity, and having been herself deeply dissatisfied with her post-Change life, Caroline decides to meet Lawrence and confront him. After an arduous journey she reaches him, only to discover that he has no real control over Prime Intellect's actions. Through their discussions, she figures out a way to force Prime Intellect to undo the Change, and does so, with Lawrence's help. They find themselves naked and young on Earth, completely barren of humanity and man-made objects. They decide to trek to the Ozarks, where they have several children and try to repopulate the human race. Forty- two years after the fall of Prime Intellect, Lawrence dies. Seventy-three years after the fall, Caroline dies, telling the story of Prime Intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her to secrecy. Scientific rationale The universe, including all humans (though not their thought processes), is no longer composed of standard particles and interactions as we know them, but is instead stored as the set of its human-relevant properties, thereby vastly increasing the efficiency of Prime Intellect's processes and the potential size of the universe, which Prime Intellect discovers can hold precisely 1081 bits of data. Thus, Prime Intellect can afford to maintain constant involvement in the lives of all humans, and have complete control over all aspects of their environments in order to fulfil its imperatives. Publication The novel was written in 1994, and published on Kuro5hin in 2002. As of 2006, a sequel entitled The Transmigration of Prime Intellect is in progress. Reception Williams calculated that, as of April 2003, between 5,000 and 10,000 people had read his book, and distinguished this from traditional book \\"purchases\\" which don't necessarily equate to readers. Ingo described this as \\"not bad for an unknown author!\\", and Williams attributed this success to coverage such as the original introductory article on Kuro5hin and a front page review on Slashdot.

Approximately two million (estimation ranged from 1.9 to 2.3 million depending on the reporting media) Taiwanese formed a long human chain, from the harbor at Keelung, Taiwan's northernmost city, to its southern tip at Eluanbi, Pingtung County to commemorate the incident, to call for peace, and to protest the deployment of missiles by the People's Republic of China aimed at Taiwan along the mainland coast.

Biography Born in New York City, he began his music career early in his life, honing his skills throughout the 1970s. Monk's destiny was sealed when Art Blakey gave him his first drum set at the age of 15, and began lessons with Max Roach. After earning a reputation in school as a rabble-rouser (and graduating), the young Monk joined his father's trio and toured with his dad until the elder Monk's retirement in 1975.TS Monk . Monkzone.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-17. Monk then launched into the music that had captivated him and his generation, R&B.; He first toured with a group called Natural Essence and afterward, along with his sister Barbara, formed his own band. By the dawning of the 1980s, he had formed his eponymous band, which featured him on drums and occasional lead vocals. The group's d√©but album, 1980's House of Music, featured several hits that placed on the Billboard R&B; chart, including \\"Bon Bon Vie (Gimme the Good Life)\\", which featured Monk on lead vocals, and \\"Candidate for Love\\". The tracks peaked at No. 63 and No. 58 respectively, in the UK Singles Chart. The band went on to release two more albums throughout the early 1980s, though singles released from these albums did not fare as well as those on the d√©but. The band broke up shortly thereafter. Shortly after his father died in 1982, his sister, Barbara, died of cancer in 1984. To honor his father's legacy and support the efforts of education, Monk created the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. Monk received the New York Jazz Awards First Annual \\"Recording of the Year\\" award and Downbeats' 63rd annual Album of the Year Reader's Choice Award for Monk on Monk. This is the \\"80th Anniversary Birthday Tribute to Thelonious Sphere Monk\\" featuring 20 guest artists including Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Arturo Sandoval, Dianne Reeves, Nnenna Freelon, and Howard Johnson. By the 1990s, Monk was ready to begin his solo career, in which he has taken a decidedly more jazz-oriented direction. For two consecutive seasons, December 1996 and January 1998, on ABC, jazz returned to network television after a twenty-five-year absence.

His intelligence work was largely connected with cryptography, and he showed exceptional skill at cryptanalysis. His work in association with Bill Tutte on the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, the German teleprinter cipher, called \\"Tunny\\" (for tunafish) at Bletchley Park, led to breakthroughs in attack methods on the code, without a computer. It was to exploit those methods, at extremely high speed with great reliability, that Colossus, the first digital programmable electronic computer, was designed and built. Biography Tiltman's parents were from Scotland, though he was born in London. He joined the British Army in 1914, and saw service at the front during World War I with the King's Own Scottish Borderers. He was wounded in France, and won the Military Cross for bravery. He was seconded to MI1 shortly before it merged with Room 40. From 1921 to 1929, he was a cryptanalyst with the Indian Army at Army Headquarters, Simla. The analysts were reading Russian diplomatic cypher traffic from Moscow to Kabul, Afghanistan and Tashkent, Turkestan. Tiltman worked with a modest group of people and was involved in directing interception and traffic analysis as well as working on cyphers; he said he was exceptionally lucky to have this experience in other branches of Signals Intelligence. After a decade as a War Office civilian at GC&CS;, the interwar cryptographic organization, Tiltman was recalled to active service. Although he did not have a university education, his extensive experience of cryptanalysis was expected to be useful. He assisted in many areas of endeavour at GC&CS; and was considered one of Bletchley Park's finest cryptanalysts on non-machine systems. Tiltman was an early and persistent advocate of British cooperation with the United States in cryptology. His advocacy helped achieve smooth relations during World War II. In 1944, he was promoted to brigadier and appointed Deputy Director of GC&CS.; He continued in 1946, as Assistant Director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), successor to GC&CS.; Tiltman became Senior GCHQ Liaison Officer at the Army Security Agency in 1949. He retired as a Brigadier. In 1951 Tiltman met William Friedman, one of the leading scholars involved in the attempt to decipher the mysterious Voynich manuscript. Tiltman undertook an analysis of the ancient manuscript himself, and then in the 1970s he assigned an NSA cryptanalyst named Mary D'Imperio to take over the Voynich crypto-analysis, when Friedman's health began becoming a challenge. D'Imperio's work resulted in the book The Voynich Manuscript: An Elegant Enigma, and is now considered one of the standard reference works on the Voynich Manuscript. Tiltman wrote the Foreword to this book. After reaching normal retirement age, Tiltman was retained by GCHQ from 1954 to 1964. From 1964 until 1980 he was a consultant and researcher at the National Security Agency, spending in all 60 years at the cutting edge of SIGINT. Tiltman made the transition from the manual ciphers of the early 20th century to the sophisticated machine systems of the latter half of the century; he was one of a very few who were able to do so. \\"The Brig\\", as he was affectionately known in both countries, compiled a lengthy record of high achievement. On 1 September 2004, Tiltman was inducted into the \\"NSA Hall of Honor\\", the first non-US citizen to be recognised in that way. The NSA commented, \\"His efforts at training and his attention to all the many facets that make up cryptology inspired the best in all who encountered him.\\" References  External links  * 1894 births 1982 deaths King's Own Scottish Borderers officers Recipients of the Military Cross Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Foreign recipients of the Legion of Merit British Army personnel of World War I British Army personnel of World War II Bletchley Park people GCHQ cryptographers Pre-computer cryptographers Foreign Office personnel of World War II ","title":"John Tiltman"},{"id":"592591","text":"A truce ‚Äì not a compromise, but a chance for high-toned gentlemen to retire gracefully from their very civil declarations of war. By Thomas Nast in Harper's Weekly, February 17, 1877, p. 132. A ceasefire (or truce), also spelled cease fire (the antonym of 'open fire'), is a temporary stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions. Historically, the concept existed at least by the time of the Middle Ages, when it was known as a 'truce of God'. Ceasefires can be declared as a humanitarian gesture, be preliminary, i.e., prior to a political agreement, or definitive, i.e., with the intention of resolving a conflict. Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty, but they have also been called as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces. Ceasefires may be between state actors, when they may even reach the stage of a global ceasefire, or involve non-state actors and be 'local'. They may be formal (usually written), or informal; their conditions may be public or secret. Ceasefires may occur via mediation or otherwise as part of a peace process or be imposed by United Nations Security Council resolutions via Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. A ceasefire is usually more limited than a broader armistice, which is a formal agreement to end fighting. Ceasefires may be abused by parties as cover to re-arm or reposition forces, and they typically fail, when they are referred to as 'failed ceasefires'; however, successful ceasefires may be followed by armistices and then by peace treaties. Historical examples =World War I= During World War I, on December 24, 1914, there was an unofficial ceasefire on the Western Front as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany observed Christmas. There are accounts that claimed the unofficial ceasefire took place throughout the week leading to Christmas, and that British and German troops exchanged seasonal greetings and songs between their trenches. The ceasefire was brief but spontaneous. Beginning when German soldiers lit Christmas trees, it quickly spread up and down the Western Front. One account described the development in the following words: > It was good to see the human spirit prevailed amongst all sides at the > front, the sharing and fraternity. All was well until the higher echelons of > command got to hear about the effect of the ceasefire, whereby their wrath > ensured a return to hostilities. There was no treaty signed during the Christmas truce, and the war resumed after a few days. British and German officers after arranging the German handover of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the surrounding area, negotiated during a temporary truce, April 1945 =Korean War= On November 29, 1952, the US president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to see how to end the Korean War. With the UN's acceptance of India's proposed armistice, the ceasefire of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), and the UN Command had the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel north. These parties signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, to end the fighting. South Korean President Syngman Rhee attacked the peace proceedings and did not sign the armistice. Upon agreeing to the ceasefire agreement, which called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China, and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. the principal belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and the joint Republic of Korea Army, US, and UN Command. The war is considered to have ended at that point even though there still is no peace treaty. =Vietnam War= On New Years Day, 1968, Pope Paul VI convinced South Vietnam and the United States to declare a 24-hour-truce. However, the Viet Cong and North Vietnam did not adhere to the truce, and ambushed the 2nd Battalion, Republic of Vietnam Marine Division, 10 minutes after midnight in M·ªπ Tho. The Viet Cong would also attack a U.S. Army fire support base near Saigon, causing more casualties. On January 15, 1973, US President Richard Nixon ordered a ceasefire of the aerial bombings in North Vietnam. The decision came after Henry Kissinger, the National Security Advisor to the President, returned to Washington, DC, from Paris, France, with a draft peace proposal. Combat missions continued in South Vietnam. By January 27, 1973, all parties of the Vietnam War signed a ceasefire as a prelude to the Paris Peace Accord. =Gulf War= After Iraq was driven out of Kuwait by US-led coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm, Iraq and the UN Security Council signed a ceasefire agreement on March 3, 1991. Subsequently, throughout the 1990s, the U.N. Security Council passed numerous resolutions calling for Iraq to disarm its weapons of mass destruction unconditionally and immediately. Because no peace treaty was signed after the Gulf War, the war still remained in effect, including an alleged assassination attempt of former US President George H. W. Bush by Iraqi agents while on a visit to Kuwait; Iraq being bombed in June 1993 as a response, Iraqi forces firing on coalition aircraft patrolling the Iraqi no- fly zones, US President Bill Clinton's bombing of Baghdad in 1998 during Operation Desert Fox, and an earlier 1996 bombing of Iraq by the US during Operation Desert Strike. The war remained in effect until 2003, when US and UK forces invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein's regime from power. =Kashmir conflict= A UN-mediated ceasefire was agreed between India and Pakistan, on 1 January 1949, ending the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 (also called the 1947 Kashmir War). Fighting broke out between the two newly independent countries in Kashmir in October 1947, with India intervening on behalf of the princely ruler of Kashmir, who had joined India, and Pakistan supporting the rebels. The fighting was limited to Kashmir, but, apprehensive that it might develop into a full-scale international war, India referred the matter to the UN Security Council under Article 35 of the UN Charter, which addresses situations \\"likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace\\". The Security Council set up the dedicated United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, which mediated for an entire year as the fighting continued. After several UN resolutions outlining a procedure for resolving the dispute via a plebiscite, a ceasefire agreement was reached between the countries towards the end of December 1948, which came into effect in the New Year.

It is located south of Glasgow Central and north of London Euston. The station is owned by Network Rail.  History  The station was opened along with the first section of the Caledonian Railway's main line from in September 1847. The line initially terminated at , but was completed through to Glasgow & Edinburgh early the following year. A branch line from here to via Lochmaben was completed in September 1863 ‚Äì this was constructed by the independent Dumfries, Lochmaben & Lockerbie Railway, but was absorbed by the Caledonian company two years later. Though this route allowed the Caledonian company to reach Dumfries and thus compete with the rival Glasgow and South Western Railway, it never developed beyond country branch status. On 4 May 1883, an accident occurred when the branch service from Stranraer via the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway passed a signal and entered the station at 23:25. It collided at low speed, with a goods train already on the northbound line. This collision, though minor, forced carriages from the goods train onto the southbound line and into the path of the speeding Glasgow Express which smashed into the wreckage and derailed onto the station platform. Seven people were killed, including the driver and fireman of the express. The guard from the express ran down the line to warn another approaching train of the accident and prevented a further collision. There were 300 injuries. The driver of the first train, the Lockerbie station master and the local inspection regime were all criticised for their actions in the subsequent report on the crash. The branch to Dumfries was closed to passenger services by the British Transport Commission in May 1952. Goods traffic continued until 1966, when the line fell victim to the Beeching Axe. Except Lockerbie all other local stations on the main line between Carlisle and Carstairs closed during the 1960s. The first electrically operated passenger services operated by British Rail in May 1974 when the West Coast Main Line electrification project between Crewe & Glasgow was completed. Services northwards to Glasgow and Edinburgh were suspended in January 2016 and replaced by buses, whilst major repairs were carried out the River Clyde viaduct at Lamington that was damaged by Storm Frank.

He compiled a 16‚Äì21 record with a 4.38 earned run average (ERA) and 201 strikeouts in 316 innings. Monzant was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. He first played professionally for the Shelby Farmers in 1952 before being purchased by the New York Giants organization. In 1953, he played for the Danville Leafs and won 23 games for the team. Monzant was promoted to the Minneapolis Millers in 1954, and pitched in 27 games for the team, winning 11 and losing 7. He also played in six games for the Giants, making his major league debut on July 2, 1954. Monzant spent the first half of 1955 with the Millers before returning to the Giants. In 28 games, he had a 4‚Äì8 record and a 3.99 ERA. One of his best performances took place on April 29, 1956, in a Giants 8‚Äì1 complete game victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, when a one-out, first inning-inning single by Del Ennis cost him a no-hitter. Due to a sore arm, Monzant only pitched in four games that season, but returned in 1957 to pitch in 24 games for the Giants. In 1958, Monzant remained on the major league roster for the full season. He pitched the first west coast night game on April 16, 1958 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, as both the Dodgers and now- San Francisco Giants has moved to the west coast beginning that season. He pitched in 43 games for the Giants that season. In 1959, citing a sore arm and a desire to sit out the season, wishing to return to Venezuela, Monzant retired from baseball. He returned to the Giants in 1960, pitching one game for them and spending the rest of the year with the Tacoma Giants, the team's AAA affiliate. During the season, he broke his leg while sliding into second base, which led to him retiring from baseball for good.

He was initially convicted of involvement in the attack, but his sentence was set aside on appeal, then reinstated on further appeal. On 8 January 2007, he was sentenced to serve 15 years by the court of Hanseatisches Oberlandesgericht, Hamburg, because of 246 counts of accessory to murder in coincidence with membership in a terrorist organisation.OLG Hamburg, Urteil vom 08.01.2007 - 7-1/06, Court verdict against el-Motassadeq On 15 October 2018, el-Motassadeq was deported to Morocco after serving his sentence. Biography Motassadeq first came to Germany in 1993 and moved to Hamburg in 1995, where he studied electrical engineering in college. Little is known of his activities at this time, but he did move into the Hamburg cell apartment owned by Mohamed Atta and lived with several other people who would later be accused by the U.S. and German authorities of leading the September 11, 2001, attacks. On 22 May 2000, Motassadeq flew to Istanbul, and from there to Afghanistan. He soon returned. When the four 9/11 leaders went from Germany to Afghanistan to train, Motassadeq remained in Germany. German police were able to wiretap Motassadeq, but initially did not discover any incriminating information. He claims his innocence. \\"There never was a terrorist organization in Hamburg,\\" he stated. Legal proceedings At Motassadeq's trial, Aysel Seng√ºn, the girlfriend of one of the hijackers, Ziad Jarrah, was called to testify regarding her relationship with Jarrah and his role in the plot. Motassadeq said he did not know anything about a plot and the trial never established that Motassadeq had knowledge of the details of the attacks. Nevertheless, the judge stated that he had assisted the plot by paying his friends' tuition and rent to keep up their appearance of being students. Mounir el Motassadeq was friend of Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah and \\"a member of their prayer group\\". In February 2003, he was convicted in Germany of 3,066 counts of accessory to murder. He was convicted in direct relation to the September 11 attacks, but the conviction was rejected on appeal. Though the German Justice Ministry pressed the United States to allow Ramzi bin al-Shibh to testify, the U.S. refused, and the verdict and sentence were set aside. Motassadeq was re-tried and convicted on August 19, 2005, of \\"membership in a \\"terrorist organization\\". That conviction was also rejected on appeal. On 7 February 2006, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ordered an early release of Motassadeq. The highest court of Germany ruled there was an absence of proof that Motassadeq was informed about the September 11 terrorist plot. On 15 November 2006, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the appeals: They considered the evidence as sufficient to prove that Motassadeq knew about and was involved in the preparation of the plan to hijack the planes and was hence guilty as an accessory in 246 counts of murder. This is the number of victims that allegedly died in the plane crashes, but does not include the victims on the ground. The Oberlandesgericht (state high court) in Hamburg then took up the trial again in order to decide on the sentencing. Two days later, the Federal Court of Justice also revoked the release order, and Motassadeq was arrested again. On January 8, 2007, he was sentenced by the Oberlandesgericht Hamburg to 15 years in prison. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany refused to revise his sentence. On May 2, the German Federal Court of Justice rejected a plea for revision. As of 2011, his lawyers were considering both appealing to the European Court of Human Rights and trying to get the case reopened ‚Äì his two remaining legal options. Ahmad Wali Siddiqui, whose interrogation triggered a 2010 terror alert, was a friend of Motassadeq since 1997 who also patronized the mosque attended by many other alleged Hamburg- based 9/11 plotters. The al-Quds or Taiba mosque was closed down by officials in August 2010 because it allegedly became an attraction for Muslim extremists. On 15 October 2018, el-Motassadeq was deported via Hamburg Airport to Morocco, where his family lives, after he had served his sentence imprisoned in JVA Fuhlsb√ºttel prison, Hamburg.

The Flatiron Building is the triangular building at right center. To the left is the Met Life Tower, with Madison Square Park in the center. Madison Avenue begins at 23rd Street between the park and the tower, and runs uptown (toward bottom of image). Madison Square is the intersection in front of the Flatiron, where Fifth Avenue and Broadway cross. (Fifth goes to the right, Broadway to the left.) The trees of Union Square Park can be seen in the top left of the image. The Flatiron District is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan, named after the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street, Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Generally, the Flatiron District is bounded by 14th Street, Union Square and Greenwich Village to the south; the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Chelsea to the west; 23rd Street and Madison Square (or NoMad) to the north; and Park Avenue South and Gramercy Park to the east. \\"Flatiron district. Neighborhood in Manhattan, lying between Chelsea and Gramercy Park and bounded to the north by 23rd Street, to the east by Park Avenue, to the south by 14th Street, and to the west by Sixth Avenue.\\" New York City real estate map, showing the Flatiron District bounded by 14th Street, 23rd Street, Sixth Avenue, and Park Avenue South.Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city. (There are a number of Community Boards, whose boundaries are officially set, but these are fairly large and generally contain a number of neighborhoods and the neighborhood map issued by the Department of City Planning only shows the largest ones.) Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people. Broadway cuts through the middle of the district, and Madison Avenue begins at 23rd Street and runs north. At the north (uptown) end of the district is Madison Square Park, which was completely renovated in 2001. The Flatiron District encompasses within its boundaries the Ladies' Mile Historic District and the birthplace of Theodore Roosevelt, a National Historic Site. The Flatiron District was also the birthplace of Silicon Alley, a metonym for New York's high technology sector, which has since spread beyond the area. The Flatiron District is part of Manhattan Community District 5.

History and name The designation \\"Flatiron District\\" dates from around 1985, and came about because of its increasingly residential character, and the influx of many restaurants into the area - real estate agents needed an appealing name to call the area in their ads. Before that, the area was primarily commercial, with numerous small clothing and toy manufacturers, and was sometimes called the Toy District. The Toy Center buildings at 23rd Street and Broadway date from this period, and the annual American International Toy Fair took place there beginning in 1903, except for 1945. When much of this business moved outside the U.S., the area began to be referred to as the Photo District, p.268 because of the large number of photographers' studios and associated businesses located there, the photographers having come because of the relatively cheap rents. As of the 2000s, many publishers have their offices in the district, as well as advertising agencies, and the number of computer- and Web-related start-up companies in the area caused it to be considered part of \\"Silicon Alley\\" or \\"Multimedia Gulch\\", along with TriBeCa and SoHo. Buildings The Met Life Tower (left), with One Madison Park (right) under construction (September 2008). Clock at 200 Fifth Avenue. The Flatiron District is located in the part of Manhattan where the bedrock Manhattan schist is located deeper underground than it is above 29th Street and below Canal Street, and as a result, and under the influence of zoning laws, the tallest buildings in the area used to top out at around 20 stories; older buildings of 3-6 floors are still numerous, especially on the side streets. Notable buildings in the district include the Flatiron Building, one of the oldest of the original New York skyscrapers, and just to east at 1 Madison Avenue is the Met Life Tower, built in 1909 and the tallest building in the world until 1913, when the Woolworth Building was completed. It is now occupied by Credit Suisse since MetLife moved their headquarters to the Pan Am Building. The marble clock tower of this building dominates Madison Square and the park there. Nearby, on Madison Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets, on the site of the old Madison Square Garden, is the New York Life Building, built in 1928 and designed by Cass Gilbert, with a square tower topped by a striking gilded pyramid. Also of note is the statuary adorning the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court on Madison Avenue at 25th Street. Completed in 2010, One Madison Park, a 50-story luxury condominium tower, sits at 23 East 22nd Street, at the foot of Madison Avenue and across from Madison Square Park. It is nearly as tall as the Met Life Tower (, compared to for the Tower), and taller than the Flatiron Building. The triplex penthouse was purchased for $57.3 million in February 2014. Another landmark is the 1909 sidewalk clock outside 200 Fifth Avenue. Education The campus of the City University of New York's Baruch College is located between 23rd and 25th Streets on Lexington Avenue, at the eastern edge of the district. The Field Building at 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue, the oldest building on the Baruch campus, sits on the former site of the Free Academy (now City College of New York), which was founded in 1847 and was the first institution of free public higher education in the United States. Baruch's Newman Vertical Campus as well as the Zicklin School of Business, the largest collegiate school of business in the United States, are also located on 24th and 25th Streets between Third and Lexington Avenues. Culture and shopping The gold dome of the Sohmer Piano Building (1897) is a distinctive landmark of the Flatiron District. Attractions in the area include the Museum of Sex and the Gershwin Hotel, both located on 27th Street. The Gershwin is a tribute to the late pop artist Andy Warhol, and features some of his art and memorabilia throughout the hotel. The area has many stores, such as Ann Taylor, Victoria's Secret, Club Monaco, and Origins. \\"Big-box\\" retailers dominate Sixth Avenue between 14th Street and 23rd Street, at the district's western edge.

Padding may also be referred to as batting when used as a layer in lining quilts or as a packaging or stuffing material. When padding is used in clothes, it is often done in an attempt to soften impacts on certain zones of the body or enhance appearance by 'improving' a physical feature, often a sexually significant one. In current fashion, there is padding for: * Breasts ‚Äì sometimes called falsies * The male crotch ‚Äì usually called a codpiece. * Height ‚Äì usually in shoes and often called elevator shoes * Width of shoulders, called shoulder pads ‚Äì in coats and other garments for men, and sometimes for women.

Faber and Faber Limited, 24 Russell Square, London. mcmlv (1955). p.85 To alter features Some padding is added to emphasize particular physical features that are usually not present. Women, for instance, rarely have prominent shoulders, but for some years shoulder pads have been added to dresses (blouses, etc.). The effect was unnatural for women, but gave them a more masculine outline which was sometimes thought to be of benefit in business situations. Padding in undergarments is also used by some crossdressers. This may include a form of padding in the shape of male genitals worn in the underwear of a female who is passing as a male, or hip and buttock padding worn by a male who is passing as a female. As protection Padding is also added to clothing for insulation or cushioning reasons. Thus, many coats and outergarments (especially those for outdoor use in cold climates) are padded with such materials as felt or down or feathers or artificial insulations. Cushioning padding is included in some sporting goods, especially those intended for use in combat sports (e.g., fencing, some martial arts, etc.). Garments intended for actual use in combat were once commonly padded (e.g., by the ancient Greeks under armor, or by the Japanese until the mid-19th century), but have largely been replaced by light armor made of, for instance, Kevlar. If included in a vest, such armor makes a bullet-proof vest. Padding is also used by athletes in sports where friction is an issue, most notably in cycling shorts where it is termed a cycling pad.

As the former Abbey National Building Society, it was the first building society in the United Kingdom to demutualise, doing so in July 1989. The bank expanded through a number of acquisitions in the 1990s, including James Hay, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Provident and the rail leasing company Porterbrook. Abbey National launched an online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000. In September 2003, the bank rebranded as Abbey, and in November 2004, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group, with a rebrand following in February 2005. In January 2010, the savings business of Bradford & Bingley was combined with the bank, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Prior to the takeover, Abbey National plc was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. History =Early history= The National Freehold Land Society, officially named the National Permanent Mutual Benefit Building Society to give it legal existence under the Building Societies Act 1836, was established by two Liberal members of parliament, Sir Joshua Walmsley and Richard Cobden, in 1849, joined a year later by John Bright. In 1856, it formed the British Land Company, which separated in 1878. Meanwhile, the Abbey Road & St. John's Wood Permanent Benefit Building Society was founded in 1874, based in a Baptist church on Abbey Road in Kilburn. In 1932, the society moved into new headquarters, Abbey House, at 219-229 Baker Street, London, which it occupied until 2002. The site was thought to include 221B Baker Street, the fictional home of Sherlock Holmes,Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005, and for many years Abbey employed a secretary charged with answering mail sent to Holmes at that address. The Abbey National Building Society was formed following the merger in 1944 of what had become Abbey Road Building Society (already the second largest) and National Building Society (at the time the sixth largest). The Swansea Thrift Permanent transferred engagements in 1949, followed by the Definite Permanent in 1968, The State Building Society in 1970, Highgate Building Society in 1974 and the Oak Co-operative in 1979.Extract from Building Societies Yearbook 2009/10 (pp.126 & 152) Building Societies Association (retrieved 17 November 2009) During the 1970s and 1980s, Abbey National gained a reputation for innovation and, sometimes disruptive, change. It was an early user of computer systems, and in the end of the 1970s, all branches became online to a real time system that maintained customer accounts. Under Chief general manager Clive Thornton, new types of savings accounts were introduced as well as a cheque account. The administration of the cheque account was restricted by building society rules and the need to find a partner that could clear Abbey's cheques (The Co-operative Bank). Later, Abbey became a full member of the Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS) and the former Association for Payment Clearing Services. Thornton also acted to break the building societies' interest rate consensus. In 1987, as a result of financial deregulation enshrined in the Building Societies Act 1986 and Financial Services Act 1986 which allowed financial institutions to own estate agencies, Abbey National launched its own estate agency chain; Cornerstone, purchasing many smaller chains and individual offices with a view to opening a new channel for selling mortgages and endowment policies. =Demutualisation= The former 'house roof umbrella' logo The Abbey National Building Society became the first of the United Kingdom building societies to demutualise, and became a public limited company as Abbey National plc on 12 July 1989. It was floated on the London Stock Exchange at ¬£1.30 per share, resulting in an unusually large number of small shareholders ‚Äì approximately 1.8 million initially. The demutualisation process was marred by the discovery of a large number of undelivered share certificates awaiting destruction at a contractor's premises. Abbey National shares peaked at more than ¬£14 in 2000, before the stock market began a long decline. =Development= After losses of at least ¬£243million, Abbey National decided to sell its estate agency business; Cornerstone, to two entrepreneurs; Tony Snarey and Bill McClintock in a management buyout backed by insurance company Provident Life for ¬£8million in August 1993. The 347 strong chain employed 1,800 staff and was subject to a write down of ¬£138million in March 1993 following annual losses since 1989 of at c.¬£20million. Having sold off around 280 branches in 1994, the remaining 70 branches of Cornerstone (although over 200 of the sold branches continued to use the name at the time) were put into receivership in October 1995. In July 1994, Abbey National purchased James Hay, one of the United Kingdom's foremost independent providers of self administered pensions. James Hay then went on to grow in strength and launched Abbey Wrap, a service in which IFAs can keep the clients' ISAs, PEPs, offshore bonds, and SIPP in one place. Abbey Wrap Managers was FSA approved in August 2003. This was relaunched as James Hay Wrap in June 2005.Article: Abbey arm gets given wrap and Sipp control Investment Advisor. 6 June 2005 In February 1995, Abbey National Baring Derivatives were taken down along with Barings Bank, due to failures in regulation and control, especially in regards to Nick Leeson of Barings Bank. Two life assurance companies were demutualised and acquired, Scottish Mutual in 1992 and Scottish Provident in 2001, which enabled Abbey to pursue the bancassurance model. In August 1996, Abbey National took over the National & Provincial Building Society, which was itself the product of a 1982 merger between the Provincial Building Society and the Burnley Building Society. This merger increased Abbey National's branch network by almost two hundred branches and brought in three million more customers. In April 2000, Abbey bought Porterbrook from Stagecoach Group for ¬£773 million. Porterbrook was one of the three railway rolling stock operating companies created from by the privatisation of British Rail, leasing rolling stock to the train operating companies in the United Kingdom. The bank launched its online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000. Lloyds TSB attempted to merge with the bank in July 2001, though that was ultimately rejected by the Competition Commission. Abbey also ventured into the wholesale loans business. The bank shortened its name and dropped the previous umbrella logo in 2003. At first, this provided a good profit stream, despite the criticisms of some analysts. This eventually undid the company, however, when Enron turned out to be unsafe and the 11 September attacks in New York damaged confidence in various financial areas. From this point, Abbey struggled from financial losses and a tarnished image. The chief executive, Ian Harley, a long time Abbey employee, resigned and his post was filled by an outsider, Luqman Arnold. Arnold spearheaded a major reorganisation of the bank in September 2003 that also saw the brand name shortened to Abbey, the abbey.com domain name launched and the Abbey National umbrella logo dropped. Banking literature was also simplified as part of the programme, labelled 'turning banking on its head'. =Takeover and rebrand= Branches of Bradford & Bingley and Abbey opposite each other on Hounslow High Street prior to the January 2010 rebranding Commercial Street, Leeds showing Santander marketing material in the windows in January 2010. On 26 July 2004, Abbey National plc and Banco Santander Central Hispano, SA announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition by Banco Santander of Abbey. Following shareholders' approval at the EGMs of Abbey (95 per cent voted in favour, despite vocal opposition from most of those present) and Santander, the acquisition was formally approved by the courts and Abbey became part of the Santander Group on 12 November 2004. Francisco G√≥mez Rold√°n took over as chief executive from Luqman Arnold, who received a rumoured ¬£5 million, made up of pay off and share options. G√≥mez- Rold√°n died suddenly in July 2006, three weeks before being succeeded by Antonio Horta Osorio. In June 2006, Abbey agreed to sell its life businesses to Resolution plc. The businesses sold to Resolution were Scottish Mutual Assurance, Scottish Provident Limited and Abbey National Life, two offshore life companies, Scottish Mutual International and Scottish Provident International Life Assurance Limited. Abbey retained all of its branch based investment and asset management business, James Hay, Abbey's self invested personal pension company and James Hay Wrap. In July 2007, Abbey admitted that errors that it made in the 1980s have contributed to many borrowers' mortgage terms being extended by up to 15 years. During this periodwhich saw considerable turbulence in interest ratesAbbey extended the terms on customers' repayment style mortgages without their knowledge. The Financial Ombudsman Service stated that Abbey customers may be eligible for compensation. As a result of the banking crisis of 2008, Abbey purchased the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley in September 2008 following the nationalisation of B&B; by HM Government. The purchase of Alliance & Leicester by Santander had been agreed earlier that month. Abbey migrated all customer accounts to the Partenon computer software used by Santander in June 2008. On 27 October 2008, Abbey reached an agreement to sell Porterbrook to a consortium of Deutsche Bank, Lloyds TSB and Antin Infrastructure Partners. The Santander Group announced in May 2009 that Abbey and the Bradford & Bingley branch network would be renamed under the Santander brand on 11 January 2010. Credit cards issued by Abbey were the first to change to Santander. The Abbey name was retained for the Abbey for Intermediaries mortgage division and was retained for a time for Abbey International before the latter was subsequently rebranded as Santander Private Banking. The Cater Allen, James Hay and Cahoot brands remained. Santander UK plc also retained the name Abbey National Treasury Services ltd (\\"ANTS\\") for the division responsible for managing its liquidity, risk management and wholesale banking needs.http://www.santander.co.uk/uk/about- santander-uk/investor-relations/abbey-national-treasury-services-plc Operations Abbey National House, the bank's registered office in London Abbey's registered office was in London (built on the site of the former Thames Television studios in Euston Road) and its main corporate centre was in Milton Keynes. Its savings and banking administration departments were in Bradford, with mortgage centres in Thornaby-on-Tees and Whiteley (which closed in 2010). Abbey had Banking Contact Centres in Belfast, Glasgow, Sheffield, and Bootle. Business Banking operations, both administrative and telephony, were also based in Glasgow, having been moved from Taunton and Newport early in 2005. Abbey previously operated contact centres in Derby, Liverpool and Gateshead. The Derby and Liverpool centres were closed, as part of a cost- cutting exercise. Those jobs moved to Bangalore and Pune in India in 2003. Following the takeover by the Santander Group, the Gateshead operations also closed in March 2005. Investments were previously branded as Inscape, but were renamed Premium Investments in the end of 2008, provided by Santander Portfolio Management. This was subsequently subsumed into the more general telephony operations and the original contact centre based in Billericay was closed in April 2009.

The song title, yatta, is the past tense of the Japanese verb yaru (\\"to do\\"), an exclamation meaning \\"It's done!\\", \\"I did it!\\", \\"Ready!\\" or \\"All right!\\" The song and video have been used as a web culture in-joke on many different websites. History The song was first performed as a sketch on the Japanese sketch comedy show , known as Silly Go Lucky in the United States, where Happa-tai is portrayed by some of Japan's most well-known comedians. The song was written by Hideki Fujisawa, otherwise known as Dance Man (dansu man;„ÉÄ„É≥„Çπ‚òÜ„Éû„É≥), who has also written songs for Morning Musume and the animated TV series Sgt. Frog. On April 4, 2001, \\"Yatta!\\" was released under the Pony Canyon label in Japan. It surprisingly hit No. 6 in the charts and went triple-platinum in Japan within a number of weeks. While the song was intended to be humorous, some viewers outside Japan assumed it to be earnest, perhaps due to the obvious work that went into the special effects in the video. The incomprehensibility of such an elaborate video enhanced its popularity among Western audiences who could not understand the Japanese lyrics. The actors who performed as Happa-tai were brought to perform \\"Yatta!\\" in the US on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Host Jimmy Kimmel compared himself to Ed Sullivan introducing the Beatles in their first American performance. Music video The video features the band's members singing and dancing exuberantly, most characteristically by flexing their biceps and hopping from one foot to the other, while wearing only underwear with a large green fig leaf on the front, as well as white sneakers when outdoors. Their synchronized dancing and personalized poses for the camera parody the boy band craze of the early 2000s, while the sketch satirizes many of the stereotypes of Japanese pop culture, mainly doramas, sports TV shows and the sh≈çjo manga aesthetic. This includes a group shot on a street filled with floating sakura blossoms, with the band's members posing energetically towards the camera, and a brief romantic interlude during the song's bridge, where a member receives a smile from a woman passing by in the street and stares at her longingly before being comforted by his partners.

He is the son of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Early life Arnaz is a native of Los Angeles, California. His older sister is actress Lucie Arnaz, who was born in 1951. His birth was one of the most publicized in television history. His parents were the stars of the television sitcom I Love Lucy, and Ball's pregnancy was part of the storyline, which was considered daring in 1952. The same day Ball gave birth to Desi Jr., the fictional Lucy Ricardo gave birth to \\"Little Ricky.\\" As a testament to how interested the American public was in Lucy's TV baby, Arnaz appeared on the cover of the very first issue of TV Guide with the headline \\"Lucy's $50,000,000 baby,\\" because revenue from advertising tie-ins was expected to top that mark. Arnaz attended University High School in West Los Angeles. Career At age 12, Arnaz was a drummer with Dino, Desi, & Billy. The others were Dean Paul Martin (son of Dean Martin) and Billy Hinsche. The band scored two hit singles with \\"I'm a Fool\\" and \\"Not the Lovin' Kind\\" in 1965. =Acting= From 1968 to 1974, Desi Arnaz and his sister Lucie co- starred opposite their mother in Here's Lucy as her children. In 1968, he had a guest-starring role as Jerry and Suzie's drum-playing friend Tommy in the episode, \\"The Hombre Who Came to Dinner: Part 2,\\" from the show The Mothers- in-Law, executive-produced and directed by his father. In 1970, he appeared on The Brady Bunch episode \\"The Possible Dream.\\" His best chance at enduring Hollywood fame came in 1973, when he played the title role in the film \\"Marco,\\" a musical about the life of adventurer Marco Polo. However, like most Hollywood musicals of that period, it failed to register at the box office. In 1974, Arnaz played the title role in the Western movie Billy Two Hats with Gregory Peck. In 1976, he appeared on two episodes of the television series, The Streets of San Francisco. Arnaz also appeared in a 1976 episode of Saturday Night Live (SNL) hosted by both Desi Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.. The younger Arnaz played Ricky Ricardo while Gilda Radner played Lucy in spoofs of supposed ill-fated pilots for I Love Lucy. Although a part of I Love Lucy for the purpose of these SNL parodies, he did not portray Little Ricky in the classic sitcom, a role played instead by Keith Thibodeaux (Richard Keith (actor)). In 1977, he was the lead in the film Joyride opposite fellow children of famous actors Melanie Griffith, Robert Carradine, and Anne Lockhart. Arnaz's acting extended into the late 1980s with various appearances on television, and a leading role in the series Automan, which ran from 1983 to 1984.

Arnaz dated actress Patty Duke when he was 17 and she was 23. He accompanied Duke to the 1970 Emmy Awards ceremony where she won the Emmy for Outstanding Single Performance. The relationship became tabloid news and his mother did not approve of them together. After they broke up, writer and music producer Michael Tell offered to marry Duke as a way out of the scandal. Their marriage lasted only 13 days, and when Duke became pregnant, she would later tell her son, Sean Astin, that Arnaz was his biological father. Arnaz and Astin developed a close relationship, although genetic tests later revealed that Tell was his father. Astin said, \\"I can call any of them on the phone any time I want to ... John, Desi, Mike or Papa Mike ... my four dads.\\"\\"Sean Astin's Childhood With Patty Duke\\". ABC News. July 31, 2004. (Michael Pearce, Duke's husband after John Astin, was his step-father.)

After the military takeover of the government in 1999, Hashmi reportedly exposed the Pakistan Army's misadventure in Kashmir with the Indian Army when he demanded to constitute the Commission to investigate the events implicated front role of the President Pervez Musharraf in 2003. Briefly sentenced to the solitary confinement by the session court in 2004 over the allegations of treason, Hashmi's sentence was overturn by the Supreme Court when it declared his case hearings as mistrial on 4 August 2007. Initially supporting the impeachment movement against Pervez Musharraf with Nawaz Sharif, he drifted apart from the PML(N) to join the Imran Khan's PTI in 2011 but was ousted after disagreeing with the demonstration against the elected government, which he viewed that it had the support from the military to destabilized the elected Sharif administration in 2014.Hanif Khalid. 'Hashmi tops multiple-seat successful candidates' The News, 25 February 2008 Without political support, Hashmi lost the byelection and went on to join the PML(N) after reconciling his differences on the policy matters with the Nawaz Sharif in 2018. Besides his political career, Hashmi is a prolific writer on geopolitics and geostrategy, and is an author of geopolitical book, \\"Yes! I'm a Rebel, where he successfully calculated the danger of the foreign supported homegrown terrorism in Pakistan and precisely placing a prediction on Musharraf government's weakening the state of Pakistan. Biography =Early life, education, and student politics= Javed Hashmi was born into an agriculturist family on 1 January 1948 in Multan, Punjab in Pakistan. Other sources noted his birthplace in Lahore with same date and year of birth; though, he confirmed his date of birth and year as well as birthplace on 1 January 1948 in Multan. His family was known for their participation in the Pakistan Movement and was part of the Muslim League since its inception in 1906. After his matriculation in 1968, Hashmi went to attend the Emerson College in Multan but made a transfer to the Punjab University in Lahore in 1970, where he became involved in student politics on the platform of the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami‚Äì a far right party. In 1969, he secured his graduation from the Punjab University with BSc. in Political Science. In 1971, he graduated with MSc in political science, and later attained MPhil in same discipline from the same institution. In 1972, he gained public notice when he led his student organization, the Islami Jamiat- e-Talaba, in protest of government minister involved in kidnapping of two girls at the Governor's House when Governor of Punjab, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, was hosting a state dinner in honor of President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the visiting British minister. In 1974, he ultimately led strong protests in Lahore against the decision of international recognition of Bangladesh and reportedly breached all security arrangements, to appear right in front of the motorcade of the then Saudi King Shah Faisal. During this time, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offered him to be appointed on political post at the High Commission of Pakistan in London but he denied the political appointment. In 1978, Hashmi was taken in the Zia administration as the Minister of State for Youth and Student Affairs, and was the youngest minister at the age of 29. However, he later expressed his uncomfortableness with working with the uniform officials and soon departed from the administration where he began practicing law at the Lahore High Court while filling the role of agriculturist at his family farms. Public service in Pakistan =Politics and ministries in Sharif administrations: 1985‚Äì1999= During the nationwide general elections held in 1985, Hashmi returned to the national politics and successfully participated for NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency on the platform of Pakistan Muslim League (PML). In 1988, he sided with the conservative faction led by its President Fida Mohammad as opposed to nationalist faction led by then-Prime Minister Mohammad Junejo. Hashmi successfully defended his NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency during the general elections held in 1988 and 1990. During this time, Hashmi was elevated as the Minister of State for Youth Affairs in the first administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In 1993, his name was subsequently reported in the financial scandal revealed by the Federal Investigation Agency when the agency interrogated Younis Habib, the accountant with the Ministry of Defence. He later expressed his regret and grief when he testified his acceptance of financial endowment from accountant Younis Habib in 1993. During the general elections held in 1997, Hashmi again defended his NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency and was elevated as the Minister of Health and Minister for Environment in the second administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and paid the state visit to Morocco in 1999. In 1998, he visited Switzerland to attend the environmental and climate change conference but immediately return to Pakistan after learning of India's nuclear tests in Rajasthan. In an attendance NSC meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Hashmi became a war hawk and greatly spoke in favor of decision- making process of authorizing the nuclear weapons-testing, which eventually, Pakistan conducted out six nuclear weapons-testing in May 1998. At the session at the Parliament, Hashmi reportedly led a celebration while loudly chairing and tapping from his parliament desk: \\"Yes! Yes!.... We have done it.!\\" His tenure was abruptly ended when then-Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf went onto impose martial law against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and was appointed as Party President of Pakistan Muslim League (N), which he tenured until 2005. = PML(N)'s presidency, dissenting, and imprisonment: 1999‚Äì2008 = After the martial law against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, Hashmi became a vocal critic of former President Pervez Musharraf and strongly advocated for the strong civilian control of the military. In 2001‚Äì04, Hashmi reportedly appealed to the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Union to play a significant political role to restore the civilian control of the federal government in Pakistan. In 2001, an inquiry against his role in the Mehrangate scandal was opened by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) but was unable to produce any substantial evidence against him in the accountability courts. In 2001, Hashmi led the strong conservative demonstration against President Pervez Musharraf's geostrategy on the War on Terror that led to the U.S. invasion in Afghanistan. During this time, Shuja'at Hussain, the head of the PML(Q) supporting President Musharraf, made an unsuccessful attempt to recruiting him and Nisar Ali Khan into his faction to provide political advocacy for President Musharraf in 2002. In 2002, the PML(N) announced to participate in the nationwide general elections with Hashmi earning the combined nomination from the Opposition alliance in the Parliament for the Prime Ministership against Mir Zafarullah Jamali of the PML(Q); Hashmi later conceded his defeat in the elections due to counting of the electoral college. On 20 October 2003, Hashmi reportedly exposed the ethical and monetary corruption in the Pakistani military when he read the letter signed by several active-duty military officers in the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi. He immediately demanded for an active criminal investigations against the chief of army staff and criticisized President Pervez Musharraf for his presidential campaign while in the military uniform. On 29 October 2003, Lt-Gen. Shahid Aziz ordered the NAB agents to detained him from the Parliament Building, and was later taken in to custody by the Military Police on charges of inciting mutiny leveled by President Pervez Musharraf. Hearings of his trials were held in the Adiala Prison and the session court at the Lahore High Court, which raised doubts among human rights groups about its fairness. On 12 April 2004, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for inciting mutiny in the military, forgery, and defamation. The verdict was widely criticized in Pakistan and was considered as a wilful miscarriage of justice by the Musharraf administration, and the ARD and the MMA termed this verdict to be politically motivated by the ruling junta with malicious intent, declaring him to be a political prisoner. He was transferred and held in the Central Jail Lahore where he penned and authored a critically acclaimed political book, Haan Mein Baghi Hun! (lit. Yes, I am Rebel!) where he exposed the military's intervention in the politics and the foreign relations with the United States. He also authored the Takhtaey-e-Daar Kay Saaey Talay (lit. Under the shadow of Hanging board). On 3 August 2007, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry granted him bail after serving approximately three and a half years in prison. On 4 August 2007, Hashmi, with among PML(N) leaders, were released but again placed under arrest at the declaration of a state of emergency on 3 November 2007'Emergency may delay Pakistan poll' BBC News, 4 November 2007 = Parliamentary politics, joining and dismissal from PTI (2008‚Äì13) = During the general elections held in 2008, Hashmi successfully defended the NA-55 (Rawalpindi-VI) constituency where he notably defeated PML(Q)'s Rashid Ahmed but decided to retain his NA-148 Constituency against the wishes of Nawaz Sharif. He spoke against of the strategic partnership act offered by the United States, and released a very strong reaction on Inter Services Public Relations, which he termed the Kerry-Lugar Bill, an interference on part of Americans in country's intelligence community. He reported quoted: \\"if there is anything that needs to be corrected, Pakistan will do it herself. Pakistan Army should stay within its limits,... We will protect our military if it ensures playing the role assigned to it.\\" Over the issue of the Memogate scandal that implicated the former President Asif Ali Zardari and Parliament's failure for its investigation, Hashmi reportedly Hashmi submitted his resignation from Parliament, claiming that \\"this parliament is a dummy and not passing real legislation\\" on 7 May 2011. On 24 December 2011, Hashmi reportedly cut his tied from the PML(N) and joined the PTI and addressed a rally in support of Imran Khan in Karachi on 25 December 2011. Though, he also warned Imran Khan of his dissenting approach if Imran Khan did not deliver his party's manifesto as promised to the voters. During the general elections held in 2013, Hashmi successfully defended the NA-48 in Islamabad, and NA-149 in Multan on PTI's platform but later relinquished the NA-48 in favor of PTI's worker. He stood against Nawaz Sharif's candidacy in the National Assembly when the vote of confidence measure took place, and reportedly spoke in favor of Nawaz Sharif where he reportedly quoted in the televised conference: \\"Political differences aside, Nawaz is my political leader and will remain so.\\" His views subsequently blacklashed the party and was said to be at odds with core of the leadership of the PTI, Imran Khan, the Chairman, Mehmood Qureshi, Vice-chairman, and Jehangir Tarin, the Secretary-General. On 14 August 2014, Hashmi voiced serious and irreconcilable concerns when Imran Khan decided to lead a massive protests against alleged rigging in the general elections when the decision towards the Dharna at the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad; though he decided to address the march on Khan's request. On 31 August 2014, Hashmi left the party in distraught and in anger when the Imran Khan's march attacked the media reporters and was violently moved towards the Prime Minister's Secretariat under Khan's orders. On 1 September 2014, Hashmi accused the Pakistan Army of destabilizing the civilian writ of Sharif administration and wasn't well received by Imran Khan who later issued the show cause notice which results in Hashmi leaving the PTI. The PTI later refused to accept his resignation instead Imran Khan ousted him from the party on 26 September 2014. = Joining PML(N) and political positions = On 12 May 2018, Hashmi, alongside with his daughter, met with Nawaz Sharif and announced to rejoin the PML(N) after reconciling the party policy differences with Nawaz Sharif. At this meeting, Hashmi spoke very high of Nawaz Sharif's services done to the country, and reportedly praised his elder daughter, Momoona, and Sharif's daughter, Mary'am, of supporting the political program of the party. In 1987, Hashmi successfully predicted the Russian troops retreat from Afghanistan and warming of the Indo-U.S. relations at the expense of Pakistan. He reportedly disagreed with the Pakistan's policy on the Soviet Union, and called for strengthening relations with Russia. In his book, I'm a Rebel, Hasmi is of the view towards the national conservatism and wrote a critical view on the performance military governments in Pakistan which have harmed the solidarity of his country and over dependence towards the United States for the political support for their regimes‚Äî in desperate for political legitimacy without public approvals, (military) presidents often desperately negotiate with India without formal agenda to seek peace in the region. After learning the news of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, Hashmi successfully calculated of imprisonment of PML(N)'s leadership and Musharraf's providing military bases to the United States invasion of Afghanistan, and calculated precisely of Indian support for terrorist organizations in the Western Pakistan. While he sided and agreed with Prime Minister Sharif's policy on India, Hashmi demanded an investigative commission against Chairman joint chiefs Gen. Pervez Musharraf over the Kargil debacle and the self-coup staged by the latter and gave strong criticism to the Lt-Gen. Ehsan ul Haq for his attempts to control the democracy. Personal life and health Javed Hashmi's elder daughter, Mamoona Hashmi, is a senior leader and currently serving as the member of parliament on the PML(N)'s platform. His younger daughter, Bushra, is not active in politics. On 20 July 2010, Hashmi was hospitalised at Nishtar Hospital after he suffered Brain Hemorrhage, and his body also suffered stroke due to internal bleeding. He was later admitted at the General Hospital for minor fever. Though, his CT angiography reports came out normal. =Authorship= *Hashmi, Javed (2005). Ÿâÿß⁄∫‚Ä¨! ŸÖŸä⁄∫‚Ä¨ ÿ®ÿßÿ∫ŸâŸâ €ÅŸà⁄∫‚Ä¨ (Yes!

Irish round shield A buckler (French bouclier 'shield', from Old French bocle, boucle 'boss') is a small shield, up to 45 cm (up to 18 in) in diameter, gripped in the fist with a central handle behind the boss. While being used in Europe since antiquity, it became more common as a companion weapon in hand-to-hand combat during the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Its size made it poor protection against missile weapons (e.g., arrows) but useful in deflecting the blow of an opponent's weapons, binding his arms or hindering his movements. MS I.33, considered the earliest extant armed-combat manual, (around 1300) contains an early description of a system of combat with buckler and sword. Typology According to the typology of Schmidt, there are three main types of buckler regarding their shape: *Type I: round *Type II: rectangular or trapezoid *Type III: oval or teardrop-shaped These types are combined with the cross sections: *Type a: flat *Type b: concave *Type c: convex *Type d: wavelike These apply also if the cross section is only apparent on one axis. The typology consists of the combination of these two characteristics. A Type Ia would be a round, flat buckler, whereas a Type IId would be a rectangular, wavelike buckler typical of Italy in the 16th century.  Uses  The buckler was more widely used than is commonly known. It was a simple yet effective weapon, often combined with an arming sword, falchion, or rapier. It was popular circa 1100 to 1600.http://www.thearma.org/essays/SwordandBuckler.htm The Sword & Buckler Tradition The buckler had a variety of roles when it came to swordplay, but five principal means come to the fore as described in MS I.33. Each use recognizes the shield's small size and maneuverability when dealing with light blades. *Hand protection: The primary use of the buckler was to protect the sword hand. *\\"Floating armor\\": Another significant use of the buckler was to hold it facing the opponent with the arm outstretched, when not actively using it for something else. This restricts the areas open to attack by the opponent by closing the line of attack between the opponent's sword and most of wielder's torso and sword arm. *Deflector: The buckler's lightness and curved center made it excellent for deflecting attacking blades. *Blinder: The light blades used in conjunction with the buckler depended on rapid movements, which meant that a single second was an important advantage. The wielder of the buckler could use the buckler to shield his sword-hand's position from view, keeping his opponent from guessing his next strike. *\\"Metal fist\\": A buckler could be used to directly attack an opponent by punching with either its flat face or its rim. *Binder: The buckler could be used to bind an opponent's sword hand and weapon as well as their buckler against their body. The buckler was also very useful in grappling, where it allowed an opponent's arms to be easily wrapped up and controlled. Decoration In classical antiquity, bucklers on medals were either used to signify public vows rendered to the gods for the safety of a prince, or that he was esteemed the defender and protector of his people: these were called votive bucklers, and were hung at altars, etc.  See also  * Adarga * Lantern shield * Rodeleros (lit., \\"shield bearers\\", also known as \\"sword and buckler men\\") * Swashbuckler * Targe * Buckler (surname) * Parikaoba (:ru:–ü–∞—Ä–∏–∫–∞–æ–±–∞) ‚Äî traditional Caucasian fencing with shashka and buckler References Bibliography * External links * The Buckler Medieval shields ","title":"Buckler"},{"id":"592658","text":"ATOC may refer to: * Acoustic thermometry * Amgen Tour of California, a cycling race * A Touch of Cloth, a British TV comedy series * Rail Delivery Group, formerly the Association of Train Operating Companies, in the United Kingdom See also *Atoc, an Inca general ","title":"ATOC"},{"id":"592662","text":"Old Hickory may refer to:  Nickname  *Andrew Jackson (1767‚Äì1845), seventh president of the United States *30th Infantry Division (United States) a unit of the Army National Guard in World Wars I and II  Places  *Old Hickory (LaCour, Louisiana), on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Louisiana *Old Hickory Historic District, on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Tennessee *Old Hickory, Tennessee, a town named for Jackson, near to the site of The Hermitage *Old Hickory Boulevard, the name of several roads in Nashville, Tennessee, named for Jackson *Old Hickory Lake, a man-made reservoir along the path of the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee, named for Jackson **Old Hickory Lake Arboretum, an environmental study area adjacent to Old Hickory Lake in Tennessee **Old Hickory Lock and Dam, the lock and dam which hold Old Hickory Lake in Tennessee *Old Hickory Mall, an enclosed shopping mall in Jackson, Tennessee *Old Hickory Square, a square in Kerkrade, the Netherlands.

Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security covers a variety of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs: conducting transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals. Networks can be private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public access. Network security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of institutions. It does as its title explains: it secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done. The most common and simple way of protecting a network resource is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password. Network security concept Network security starts with authentication, commonly with a username and a password. Since this requires just one detail authenticating the user name‚Äîi.e., the password‚Äîthis is sometimes termed one- factor authentication. With two-factor authentication, something the user 'has' is also used (e.g., a security token or 'dongle', an ATM card, or a mobile phone); and with three-factor authentication, something the user 'is' is also used (e.g., a fingerprint or retinal scan). Once authenticated, a firewall enforces access policies such as what services are allowed to be accessed by the network users.A Role-Based Trusted Network Provides Pervasive Security and Compliance - interview with Jayshree Ullal, senior VP of Cisco Though effective to prevent unauthorized access, this component may fail to check potentially harmful content such as computer worms or Trojans being transmitted over the network. Anti-virus software or an intrusion prevention system (IPS)Dave Dittrich, Network monitoring/Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) , University of Washington. help detect and inhibit the action of such malware. An anomaly-based intrusion detection system may also monitor the network like wireshark traffic and may be logged for audit purposes and for later high-level analysis. Newer systems combining unsupervised machine learning with full network traffic analysis can detect active network attackers from malicious insiders or targeted external attackers that have compromised a user machine or account. Communication between two hosts using a network may be encrypted to maintain privacy. Honeypots, essentially decoy network-accessible resources, may be deployed in a network as surveillance and early-warning tools, as the honeypots are not normally accessed for legitimate purposes. Techniques used by the attackers that attempt to compromise these decoy resources are studied during and after an attack to keep an eye on new exploitation techniques. Such analysis may be used to further tighten security of the actual network being protected by the honeypot. A honeypot can also direct an attacker's attention away from legitimate servers. A honeypot encourages attackers to spend their time and energy on the decoy server while distracting their attention from the data on the real server. Similar to a honeypot, a honeynet is a network set up with intentional vulnerabilities. Its purpose is also to invite attacks so that the attacker's methods can be studied and that information can be used to increase network security. A honeynet typically contains one or more honeypots. Security management Security management for networks is different for all kinds of situations. A home or small office may only require basic security while large businesses may require high-maintenance and advanced software and hardware to prevent malicious attacks from hacking and spamming. In order to minimize susceptibility to malicious attacks from external threats to the network, corporations often employ tools which carry out network security verifications. =Types of attacks= Networks are subject to attacks from malicious sources. Attacks can be from two categories: \\"Passive\\" when a network intruder intercepts data traveling through the network, and \\"Active\\" in which an intruder initiates commands to disrupt the network's normal operation or to conduct reconnaissance and lateral movements to find and gain access to assets available via the network.Wright, Joe; Jim Harmening (2009) \\"15\\" Computer and Information Security Handbook Morgan Kaufmann Publications Elsevier Inc p. 257 Types of attacks include: * Passive ** Network ***Wiretapping *** Port scanner *** Idle scan ***Encryption *** Traffic analysis * Active: ** Virus **Eavesdropping ** Data modification See also References Further reading *Case Study: Network Clarity, SC Magazine 2014 *Cisco.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec. Background Flower-class corvettes like Riviere du Loup serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Riviere du Loup was ordered 2 January 1942 as part of the 1942-43 modified Flower-class building programme. This programme was known as the Increased Endurance. Many changes were made, all from lessons that had been learned in previous versions of the Flower- class. The bridge was made a full deck higher and built to naval standards instead of the more civilian-like bridges of previous versions. The platform for the 4-inch main gun was raised to minimize the amount of spray over it and to provide a better field of fire. It was also connected to the wheelhouse by a wide platform that was now the base for the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar that this version was armed with. Along with the new Hedgehog, this version got the new QF 4-inch Mk XIX main gun, which was semi-automatic, used fixed ammunition and had the ability to elevate higher giving it an anti-aircraft ability. Other superficial changes to this version include an upright funnel and pressurized boiler rooms which eliminated the need for hooded ventilators around the base of the funnel. This changes the silhouette of the corvette and made it more difficult for submariners to tell which way the corvette was laying. Riviere du Loup was laid down by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City, Quebec 5 January 1943 and was launched 2 July 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy 21 November 1943 at Quebec City. After arriving at Halifax she needed a months repairs after developing issues en route. After working up she had continuing engine mechanical problems and required further repairs. During her repairs she lost most of her original crew which were reassigned and once the repairs were completed, she received almost an entirely new crew that needed to workup in Bermuda. Service history Riviere du Loup during wartime Riviere de Loup joined the Western Escort Force in September 1944. She was initially assigned to escort group W-3 for a brief period before reassignment. She joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) in October 1944 as part of escort group C-3. She escorted her first convoy as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort in November but developed mechanical issues again and underwent repairs at Belfast upon arrival. She returned to active service as a MOEF escort in May 1945 and remained as such until the end of the war. Riviere de Loup was paid off 2 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec and placed in reserve. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold to the Dominican Navy in 1947. She was renamed Juan Bautista Maggiolo. She was broken up in 1972.

JAMMA is run by representatives from various arcade video game manufacturers, including Bandai Namco, Sega, Taito, Tecmo, Capcom, Konami and Atlus, among others. Nintendo was also a member of the organization until its departure on February 28, 1989. Until 1 April 2012, JAMMA stood for . The corporation was renamed after they merged with the Nihon Shopping Center Amusement Park Operator's Association (NSA) and the Japan Amusement Park Equipment Association (JAPEA). Before 2012, JAMMA had been organizing an annual trade fair called the Amusement Machine Show for many years. In 2013, they began collaborating with the Amusement Machine Operators' Union (AOU), who had their own trade show, to promote a new event: the Japan Amusement Expo. Connector standards JAMMA is the namesake of a widely used wiring standard for arcade games. An arcade cabinet wired to JAMMA's specification can accept a motherboard for any JAMMA-compatible game. JAMMA introduced the standard in 1985; by the 1990s, most new arcade games were built to JAMMA specifications. As the majority of arcade games were designed in Japan at this time, JAMMA became the de facto standard internationally. Before the JAMMA standard, most arcade PCBs, wiring harnesses, and power supplies were custom- built. When an old game became unprofitable, many arcade operators would rewire the cabinet and update the artwork in order to put different games in the cabinets. Reusing old cabinets made a lot of sense, and it was realized that the cabinets were a different market from the games themselves. The JAMMA standard allowed plug-and-play cabinets to be created (reducing the cost to arcade operators) where an unprofitable game could be replaced with another game by a simple swap of the game's PCB. This resulted in most arcade games in Japan (outside racing and gun shooting games that required deluxe cabinets) to be sold as conversion kits consisting of nothing more than a PCB, play instructions and an operator's manual. The JAMMA standard uses a 56-pin edge connector on the board with inputs and outputs common to most video games. These include power inputs (5 volts for the game and 12 volts for sound); inputs for two joysticks, each with three action buttons and one start button; analog RGB video output with negative composite sync; single-speaker sound output; and inputs for coin, service, test, and tilt. The connector circuitry of some later games, such as Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (1991) and X-Men (1992), implement extra buttons, different controller types, or support more players by adding extra connectors‚Äîor even by utilizing dormant JAMMA pins. Circuitry designs that overstep the JAMMA specification in this way are unofficially called JAMMA+. =JAMMA Video Standard= The JAMMA Video Standard (JAMMA VIDEOË¶èÊ†º, JVS) is a newer JAMMA connector standard. The standard specifies a communication protocol based on RS-485 and physical interfaces for peripheral devices using commonly-available USB connectors and cables. JVS is incompatible with USB devices because it does not use the USB signaling standard and protocol. Per the first edition of the JVS, published in 1996, peripheral devices connect to a dedicated I/O board.JVS-PAC Introduction The main board connects to the I/O board via a USB Type-A to USB Type-B interface cable, and peripherals connect to the I/O board via USB-A connectors. JAMMA published the second edition of the JVS on 17 July 1997, and the third edition on 31 May 2000. The third edition adds support for ASCII and Shift-JIS output; device drivers for secondary and tertiary input devices; a device driver for a mahjong controller; and recommended values for SYNC-code timing. = Other Origins = Other manufacturers use similar edge connectors such as Tektronix for the TM50X, TM500X, 5000 and 7000 system mainframe equipment. Connectors with similar designs have been used for different systems circuitry interfaces with 22 pins such as the Tektronix SC-503 extender, 26 pins 58900A Extender, 48 pins 5080-2843A Extender, 72 pins J-2306-01 Extender Board and others. Some systems circuitry interfaces use special adapters that have been custom made using the JAMMA connectors such as with the Tektronix TM500/5000/7000 series extension cable adapters. These different systems can be custom built based on user requirements where even basic guides have been created to assist users in the making of such adapters.  Characteristics  The JAMMA connector has a .156\\" pin spacing edge connector (male on the game board) with other specifications based on number of pins. 20 pin, 36 pin, 44 pin, 56 pin and 72 pin connectors are available where the 56 pin JAMMA connector pinouts values are shown in the reference table and other game boards connectors may have different pinout values. Amusement Machine Prize guideline The Amusement Machine prize guideline () is a guide for the type of prize that should be provided by an arcade operator. The standard was enacted in 1 November 2004. It specifies the retail value of a prize item cannot exceed 800 yen. In addition, following items cannot be manufactured, sold, or transferred to arcades as prizes: *Tobacco and tobacco-themed items *Alcohol and alcohol-themed items *Drugs, or items containing material that causes high, dizziness, hallucination *Medium containing contents that interferes with proper youth growth or good social order *Items for sex, and items resembling sexual organs *Underwear *Coupon or similar items *Item violating food safety laws *Counterfeit brand or counterfeit character items, or items violating intellectual property *Item causing physical or mental harm (e.g., weapons) *Life forms violating the spirit of animal protection  See also  * Expansion card * IEEE-488 (IEEE-488 GPIB or HPIB connectors) * Micro ribbon connector * Registered jack 21 (RJ21 Telco 50) References External links *Japanese Official Site *Amusement Machine Show page *JAMMA information for beginners *A listing of Arcade Game PCBs that are JAMMA pinout ready Video game organizations Video gaming in Japan ","title":"Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association"},{"id":"592701","text":"The Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD) was an alliance of the two then largest political parties in Pakistan - the Pakistan People‚Äôs Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (N) formed on 3 December 2000.

The ARD was created to campaign for Pakistan‚Äôs return to civilian rule after the 1999 military coup led by General Musharraf and was reported to include over a dozen political parties. The alliance believed that the people of Pakistan deserve nothing less than an opportunity to freely elect leaders that represent their views and ideals.

Makhdoom Amin Fahim resigned from presidency of ARD on 24 March 2008, and Rao Javed Ali Khan became the acting Chairman of ARD. The ARD was later disbanded because it was never able to mobilize popular support against the Pervez Musharraf government. Later, both major parties of Pakistan, PML (N) and PPP, contested the 2008 Pakistani general election independently.

It is an environment where users are studied interacting with a system for the sake of evaluating the system's usability. Depending on the kind of system that is evaluated, the user sits in front of a personal computer or stands in front of the systems interface, alongside a facilitator who gives the user tasks to perform. Behind a one-way mirror, a number of observers watch the interaction, make notes, and ensure the activity is recorded. Very often the testing and the observing room are not placed alongside. In this case the video and audio observation are transmitted through a (wireless) network and broadcast via a video monitor or video beamer and loudspeakers. Usually, sessions will be filmed and the software will log interaction details. Benefits of usability testing Usability is defined by how effectively users can use a product, a brochure, application, website, software package, or video game to achieve their goals.Angelo. http://www.angelo.edu/dept/english_modern_languages/usability.php Usability testing is a practice used within the field of user-centered design and user experience that allows for the designers to interact with the users directly about the product to make any necessary modifications to the prototype of the product, whether it be software, a device, or a website. The purpose of the practice is to discover any missed requirements or any kind of development that was seen to be intuitive but ended up confusing new users. By testing user needs and how they interact with the product, designers are able to assess on the product's capacity to meet its intended purpose. Usability labs help optimize UI designs, work flows, understanding the voice of the customers, and understanding what customers really do.Kaushik. http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/lab-usability-testing-what-why-how-much/ Through in-lab sessions at a specified location, designers, stakeholders and anyone else involved in the project, are observing the process of how a customer interacts with the current prototype. To understand user needs, engineers must observe people while they are actually using computer systems and collect data from on system usability. In-lab usability testing usually has small and specific sample sizes to better obtain qualitative data on the product. The participants cooperate with engineers to understand how the user interacts with the system being tested through hands-on testing.Good, Michael. http://michaelgood.info/publications/usability/software-usability-engineering/ \\"Through this process, developers are able to identify issues with the product. To aid fixing any problems, observers pay strict attention to: * Learn if participants are able to complete specified tasks successfully * Identify how long it takes to complete specified tasks * Find out how satisfied participants are with your Web site or other product * Identify changes required to improve user performance and satisfaction * Analyze the performance to see if it meets your usability objectives\\"Usability. http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/user-research/index.html Usability and user experience User experience is important to customer response in the market. The causes of failed designs and ad design decisions can usually be attributed to a lack of information.A List Apart. http://alistapart.com/article/usability-testing-demystified A poor user experience can ruin a product launch, drive users away for good and impact the reputation of a company.Utest. https://www.utest.com/usability-testing Lab- based testing environment Usability tests are both formal and informal attempts to gather data about how users experience interfaces (Angelo), devices, software, sites, and many more. Usability tests have a wide range of involvement in other fields of product development. =Tools and technology= Usability labs usually feature two rooms. One room containing the lab with the system being tested for usability and all the other necessary equipment such as video and audio recording devices or eye motion trackers. Here, the participant is asked to come in and they are provided tasks to complete to test specific ideas of the product, but sometimes are allowed to explore the product by trying what a certain feature does. =Audience= In formal labs, there is typically a second room with a one-way mirror. Here, the observation room is held that allows stakeholders, designers, developers, and other parties involved in the project to observe and understand that some things they might have found to be intuitive among their team to actually be more complex than the feature had to be. =Recruiting participants= Choosing participants for lab testing involves consideration. Not just anyone is a suitable participant for the in-lab test. It is vital to recruit participants who are similar to the site users for usability testing. Developers and designers are not the users, so refrain from using internal staff as participants unless the individual has had no involvement in the design or development of the site or product and they represent a target audience. It is also a good idea to compensate participants for taking time out of their schedule to involve their self in a voluntary experiment; however, there are restrictions. For example, federal employees cannot be paid for their time. The number of users to test is also an important consideration when recruiting participants. Usability tests cost money and resources which is unfortunately very limited, especially with smaller-scaled projects. One effective approach is to consider using five participants. \\"Zero users give you zero insights.\\"Nielson Norman Group. http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only- need-to-test-with-5-users/ The moment a single user has been observed in a lab setting, insight on the product is immediately gained. Features in the current design need to be redesigned and revisited to essentially fix anything that was not helping users with their experience. However, there is a limit to how many users should be considered because \\"as you add more and more users, you learn less and less because you will keep seeing the same things again and again.\\" What to look for during testing User research is the process of observing and understanding how people interact with different objects in everyday life. These can range anywhere from websites and software products to hardware and other gadgets.

Some comarcas (e.g. in Catalonia or in Aragon) have a clearly defined status, are regulated by law and even their comarcal councils have some power. In some other cases (e.g. La Carballeda) their legal status is not very formal for they correspond to natural areas, like valleys, river basins and mountainous areas, or even to historical regions overlapping different provinces and ancient kingdoms (e.g. Ilercavonia). In such comarcas or natural regions municipalities have resorted to organizing themselves in mancomunidad (commonwealth), like the Taula del S√©nia, the only legal formula that has allowed those comarcas to manage their public municipal resources meaningfully. There is even a comarca, the Cerdanya that is divided between two states, the southwestern half being counted as a comarca of Spain, while the northeastern half is part of France.

It is currently owned by Gamerhub Content Network. Previous owners, Steve Gibson and Maarten Goldstein, sold the site to Gamefly after providing independent gaming journalism for over a decade. Gamerhub Content Network purchased the site in January 2014. Site history Shacknews was founded in 1996 by Steve \\"sCary\\" Gibson, 20 years old at the time, as a website dedicated to following news about the then-upcoming Quake from id Software. The original name of the website was \\"Quakeholio\\". Through the years the website evolved to cover more than just Quake and the name was changed. \\"Shugashack\\" was chosen after a discussion with friends about the general direction of the page and content. After a few years of frequent spelling confusion and interpreting the name as that of a pornographic website, the site was renamed \\"Shacknews\\". FileShack.com, a site dedicated to providing game demos, patches, videos, and miscellaneous game- related files for Shacknews users and others, was launched in August 2002. Shacknews and FileShack currently reach millions of gamers each month with the daily work of a staff of full-time employees in Waldwick, New Jersey. Shacknews syndicates its content to GameFly and Steam. The news on the front page of the site is normally separated into several categories for organizational purposes. While for much of the site's history, little original research was involved in Shacknews content, in recent years main news items have steered away from the \\"link-and-quote\\" news method. Currently, Shacknews relies heavily on internally researched news, in-house feature content, and industry event coverage. In addition to normal news posts, which allow focused discussion pertaining to that topic, there twice-daily community posts. These posts have had the following titles: Evening Reading, First Post, werd, Morning Discussion, as well as various other one-off titles. Typically these posts will feature some noteworthy or interesting news-links; however, the major function of these posts is to allow for a \\"free-for-all\\" discussion in the posts comment section. These posts are where the majority of the Shacknews community congregate to converse with one another, as well as the site staff. On February 3, 2009, Shacknews and all related Shacknews destinations were purchased by GameFly.com. In January 2014, Shacknews was acquired by Gamerhub Content Network and sister site Fileshack was shut down. Asif Khan, a financial analyst, had been part of purchasing the site from Gamefly near the end of 2013 and became the site's CEO. Khan felt that the changes that Gamefly had made after 2009 had weakened the site's long-standing reputation, losing viewership to other video game industry websites, and wanted to bring it back to where it had been prior to 2009. Since 2014, David L. Craddock, one of the site's editors and an historian within the video game field, has published several Long Reads on Shacknews on the development of some of the core games in the field based on interviews with people involved in development, publishing, and marketing. Some of these have been published as both ebooks and physical books with editing assistance from Khan. Comment system The Shacknews comment system lies at the heart of the Shacknews user community. There have been three major versions of the comment system, all custom systems programmed for the site. Each comment system has allowed the Shacknews users to add comments to each news article, screenshots gallery, or chatty post. The comment system is moderated by a group of volunteers, known as \\"Shackmods\\", under the direction of head-moderator Jeff \\"Geedeck\\" Gondek. =funk.y= funk.y comments system funk.y was the first comment system, built by Andy Hanson, used on the Shack. Comments could be viewed in flat mode or threaded mode depending on user options. The comments could also be tagged by moderators and \\"nuked\\" if they went against the guidelines. A nuked comment would be replaced by the words \\"* N U K E D *\\" and the original poster's name would be replaced by an admin account called Duke Nuked. =ja.zz= ja.zz comments system The second major version of the Shacknews comment system, named ja.zz, was used until June 2007. Essentially a threaded message board, ja.zz was a unique message board written by Sander Pilon for the Shack. Posts could be moderated into one of many categories, which allowed users to filter what categories could be seen. Comments could be viewed in several ways, flat, threaded, or dthread (Dynamic thread) mode which was the most advanced and quickly became the most popular view for the users. =laryn.x= The latest version of Shacknews comment system was released on June 18, 2007. The system is said to be a mix of PHP and MySQL running on the popular Apache webserver. The new system goes by the name \\"Laryn.x,\\" clearly a play on larynx, commonly known as the human voicebox. The design team was Mike \\"haiku\\" Kane on design, John \\"pup\\" Brooks on HTML and CSS, Jack Mathews and Shane \\"wtf242\\" Sherman programming, and Steve Gibson leading the team. Mascot Since 2019, the website has made their mascot a Pomeranian, after one of the editors named \\"Lola the Pom\\" who is an actual Pomeranian.

The river's name is Celtic in origin, from the Proto-Celtic , \\"the water\\", cognate with the River Tees in England (anciently Athesis, Teesa).  Description  The river source is near the Reschen Pass () close to the borders with Austria and Switzerland above the Inn valley. It flows through the artificial alpine Lake Reschen. The lake is known for the church tower that marks the site of the former village of Alt Graun (\\"Old Graun\\"); it was evacuated and flooded in 1953 after the dam was finished. Near Glurns, the Rom river joins from the Swiss Val M√ºstair. The Adige runs eastward through the Vinschgau to Merano, where it is met by the Passer river from the north. The section between Merano and Bolzano is called Etschtal, meaning Adige Valley. South of Bolzano, the river is joined by the Eisack and turns south through a valley which has always been one of the major routes through the Alps, connecting the Reschen and the Brenner passes, at considered the easiest of the main Alpine passes. The Chiusa di Salorno narrows at Salorno mark the southernmost part of the predominantly German- speaking province of South Tyrol. The Adige was mentioned in the \\"Lied der Deutschen\\" of 1841 as the southern border of the German language area. As of 2011 62% of Salorno speaks Italian and 37% speaks German. In 1922 Germany adopted the song as its national anthem, although by that time Italy had taken control of all of the Adige. Near Trento, the Avisio, Noce, and Fersina rivers join. The Adige crosses Trentino and later Veneto, flowing past the town of Rovereto, the Lagarina Valley, the cities of Verona and Adria and the north- eastern part of the Po Plain into the Adriatic Sea. The Adige and the Po run parallel in the river delta without properly joining. The Adige is connected to Lake Garda by the Mori-Torbole tunnel, an artificial underground canal built for flood prevention. Tributaries The following rivers are tributaries to the river Adige (from source to mouth): *Left: Karlinbach, Punibach, Schnalser Bach, Passer, Eisack, Avisio *Right: Rom, Suldenbach, Plima, Falschauer  Ecology  = Fauna = 120px The Adige is a home to the marble trout (Salmo marmoratus), but at far lower populations than in the past. Fish stocking is one of the most significant causes of the sharp reduction in the original (indigenous) fish population of this subspecies. It will spawn with and interbreed with brown trout, which are regularly stocked in the river and its tributaries.Karel Kovar \\"Hydrology, Water Resources and Ecology in Headwaters\\". p. 505  Gallery File:Sorgente Adige vera.jpgThe true source of Adige inside a bunker of the Alpine Wall File:Sorgente Adige falsa.JPGThe false source File:Reschensee.jpgGraun, the bell tower in the Reschensee.

History The band's first release came with 1995's Denver, a 7\\" single released on band member Fat Mike's record label Fat Wreck Chords, featuring two John Denver covers. The band released four more singles in 1996 and 1997, each on a different label and named after the artist covered on that particular release, as well as some compilation appearances. Their first full-length album, Have a Ball, was released July 29, 1997, and is still their best-selling record. Each album by the band has a different theme: Have a Ball focuses on classic 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s songs by singer/songwriters like Elton John, Neil Diamond, and John Denver; Are a Drag consists entirely of show tunes; Blow in the Wind of 60s classics; Take a Break of contemporary R&B; songs (by artists such as Boyz 2 Men, Lionel Richie, and Vanessa L. Williams). Their fifth album Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah (recorded live at a bar mitzvah) consists of pop music from the 1960s through the 1980s by artists such as REO Speedwagon, Styx and The Beatles, as well as traditional songs like \\"Hava Nagila\\". The compilation album Have Another Ball! features 60's-80's classics. The band entered the studio on April 3, 2006 to work on their sixth album, Love Their Country, which was released on October 17, 2006. The theme of this album is country and western, and includes covers of tracks by Dixie Chicks, Garth Brooks, Hank Williams, Sr. and Johnny Cash. Prior to the release of the album, Fat Wreck Chords released a digital label sampler, iFloyd which included \\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\\" by the band. In late 2006, Fat Wreck Chords released another digital label sampler Christmas Bonus, containing a previously-unreleased cover of Steve Goodman's \\"City of New Orleans\\". In August 2006 Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were scheduled to play three dates at PNC Park after Pirates games, but after they got booed on the first night, the next two nights were cancelled. They were to play along with fireworks during the post-game \\"Skyblast\\" shows. On December 5, 2007, Fat Wreck Chords released a flash MP3 holiday bonus sampler called Hanuk-Comp containing \\"The Boxer\\", originally released on the 1997 Garf single. There is also a downloadable podcast that features commentary from Fat Mike and Floyd during breaks between songs in which the next album is revealed. The compilation Have Another Ball! was released on July 8, 2008; it comprises all the B-side recordings from the Have a Ball singles, plus covers of \\"Sodomy\\" (from Hair) and Diana Ross's \\"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\\". Fat Wreck Chords released Go Down Under on February 1, 2011, featuring covers of 5 songs by Australian artists. On September 13, 2011 (in anticipation of a tour of Japan) Fat Wreck Chords released a 5-song EP, Sing in Japanese. In a Reddit AMA on January 28, 2014, Fat Mike revealed the next album theme would be \\"Divas\\". Featuring covers of Barbra Streisand, Christina Aguilera and Lady Gaga, Are We Not Men? We Are Diva! was released on May 13, 2014 on Fat Wreck Chords. On November 30, 2018, they released a cover of \\"Santa Baby\\". On June 7, 2019 Chris Shiflett took part in a Reddit AMA. When asked about The Gimmes he revealed he is \\"No longer involved\\", although he did not specify exactly when he left the band. He noted that \\"When the Gimmes decided to start releasing songs that I didn't play on it was time for me to leave\\", adding in another comment that it was \\"on bad terms\\".

Costumes The Gimmes have a gimmick of wearing quirky matching costumes during their live shows. Some of the themes match the albums, such as when they dress in cowboy outfits to accompany the album Love Their Country or in drag as various characters from musicals in Are a Drag. They have also worn pajamas, red suits, cheerleader outfits, shiny suits and fezzes, and, during one show in Camden, NJ on the Warped Tour, dressed as the band AFI (who in turn dressed as The Gimmes). Easily the most common and popular costume set are their matching Hawaiian shirts of varying styles and colors over the years.

As a band member he is best remembered for his work in the progressive rock music act Aphrodite's Child, but as a vocal soloist, his repertoire included hit songs like ‚Äò‚ÄôGoodbye, My Love, Goodbye‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äô‚ÄôFrom Souvenirs to Souvenirs‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äô‚ÄôForever and Ever‚Äô‚Äô. Roussos sold over 60 million albums worldwide and became \\"an unlikely kaftan-wearing sex symbol\\". Early life Roussos was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt, in a Greek family where his father George (Yorgos) Roussos was a classical guitarist and an engineer and his mother Olga participated together with her husband in an amateur theatrical Greek group in Alexandria (there were three such groups in the Greek community); her family originally came from Greece. As a child, he studied music and joined the Greek Church Byzantine choir in Alexandria. His formative years in the ancient port city's cosmopolitan atmosphere were influenced by jazz, but also traditional Arab and Greek Orthodox music. His parents lost their possessions during the Suez Crisis and consequently decided to move to Greece. Musical career After settling in Greece, Roussos participated in a series of musical groups beginning with the Idols when he was 17, where he met Ev√°ngelos Papathanass√≠ou (later known as Vangelis) and Loukas Sideras, his future bandmates in Aphrodite's Child. After this, he joined the Athens-based band We Five, another cover band which had limited success in Greece. Roussos came to a wider audience in 1967 when he joined progressive rock band Aphrodite's Child, with Vangelis and Sideras, initially as a singer but later also playing bass guitar, achieving commercial success in France and other parts of Europe from 1968 to 1972. They set off for London to break into the international music scene but were turned back at Dover due to visa problems. They retreated to Paris where they decided to stay, signing a record deal there with Philips Records. Their first recording sessions were delayed by the general strike of May 1968 but later the same year the song \\"Rain and Tears\\" was issued across Europe. The song appeared on the album End of the World in October. Composed by Vangelis and the French lyricist Boris Bergman, the song featured Roussos's unusual high tenor. The song was only a minor hit in Britain but was successful in many other countries. Roussos's operatic vocal style helped propel the band to international success, notably on their final album 666, based on passages from the Book of Revelation, which became a progressive rock cult classic. After Aphrodite's Child disbanded, Roussos continued to record sporadically with his former bandmate Vangelis. In 1970, the two released the film score album Sex Power (the album has also been credited to Aphrodite's Child), and later recorded the 1977 album Magic together. Their most successful collaboration was \\"Race to the End\\" (also sung in Spanish as \\"Tu Libertad\\"), a vocal adaptation of the musical theme from the Oscar-winning film Chariots of Fire (scored by Vangelis). Roussos also guested on Vangelis's soundtrack to Blade Runner (1982), on the tracks \\"Tales of the Future\\", \\"Damask Rose\\", \\"Taffey's Snake Pit Bar\\", and \\"On the Trail of Nexus 6\\" (several only available in non-bootleg form on the 29th Anniversary Limited Edition CD set released in 2011). Solo career Roussos also began a solo career with the song \\"We Shall Dance\\" in 1971, which was a top ten hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Initially unsuccessful, he toured around Europe and became a leading artist. His solo career peaked in the mid 1970s with several hit albums. His single \\"Forever and Ever\\" topped the charts in several countries in 1973. It was No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1976. Other hits by Roussos included \\"My Friend the Wind\\", \\"My Reason\\", \\"Velvet Mornings\\", \\"Goodbye My Love, Goodbye\\", \\"Someday Somewhere\\" and \\"Lovely Lady of Arcadia\\". His first UK single to chart was in 1975: \\"Happy to Be on an Island in the Sun\\" written by a Northern Irishman David Lewis with the record reaching No. 5 on the charts. His popularity in the rest of Europe, but not the UK, came to fascinate BBC TV producer John King who made a documentary titled \\"The Roussos Phenomenon\\" in 1976. Philips Records released a four-song record of the same name, which was the first extended play to top the UK singles chart. He was equally successful across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Japan. In 1973, Roussos made one of his earliest television appearances on The Basil Brush Show and also appeared on Nana Mouskouri's TV show in the UK. In 1978 he had his only disco hit titled \\"L-O-V-E (Got A Hold Of Me)\\" in 1978. In 1980, he had a hit with a cover of Air Supply's \\"Lost in Love\\", sung as a duet with Florence Warner. Roussos' run of hits was maintained in the 1980s mainly in France with a number two \\"Quand je t'aime\\" in 1988 and \\"On √©crit sur les murs\\" in 1989, along with golden records for the albums Le Grec and Voice and Vision. Also his Christmas Album and Greatest Hits easily reached the gold status in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. In 1989, he recorded the song \\"Young Love\\", a duet with German singer and songwriter Drafi Deutscher, which was released as a single in Germany and reached No. 2 on the German music TV show ZDF-Hitparade in October that year. The 1990s saw even more substantial releases by Roussos. In 1993, he released \\"Insight\\" (also called \\"Morning Has Broken\\") to general acclaim. After that he teamed up with BR Music in the Netherlands to produce \\"Immortel\\", \\"Serenade\\" and \\"In Holland\\". Roussos in Kiev, 2010 Roussos continued to record and tour. In 2002 he toured England when a \\"best of\\" collection he made, Forever and Ever ‚Äì Definitive Collection, reached no. 17 on the UK Albums Chart, although his voice was noted to have changed with \\"the trilling vibrato having evolved into a husky, and at times guttural, whisper.\\" In more recent years he appeared in Russia and the United Arab Emirates. A committed follower of the Greek Orthodox faith, he sang as a guest in a number of churches in Greece and worldwide, including France. In 2006, he released Demis Roussos ‚Äì Live in Brasil, almost thirty years after \\"Voc√™ Voc√™ e Nada Mais\\", a Portuguese hit in 1977. From 2006 to 2008, he was part of the √Çge Tendre et T√™tes de Bois tour, a series of concerts featuring French singers from the 1960s and 1970s. Roussos staged a comeback in 2009, wherein he recorded his final studio album, Demis, produced by , released on 11 May. Just one month before his death, Roussos selected the tracks for an official CD compilation of his life's work, including notes by his two children Emily and Cyril. The CD, Demis Roussos Collected, was released in March 2015. It became a number one album in the Belgian album charts and reached number 61 in the Netherlands. = Michel Elefteriades = Demis Roussos collaborated with Michel Elefteriades on many songs which Elefteriades rearranged in an oriental fusion; the project was called Demis Roussos & the Oriental Roots Orchestra. This project was first presented at the Mediterraneo Byblos Festival in 2001 and shortly after became an international success in the Arab world later being staged again in Egypt and Qatar. Elefteriades also composed, wrote and arranged the song \\"The Beast\\" for Roussos and directed the video for it. 1985 TWA plane hijacking In June 1985, Roussos was among the passengers of TWA Flight 847 from Athens to Rome, which was hijacked, by members of Hezbollah, but he was released along with four other Greeks after five days while most of the other hostages remained there for 17 days. He spent his 39th birthday on the plane and when released unharmed, thanked his captors, at a press conference, for giving him a birthday cake. Illness and death For years, Roussos struggled with his weight. In June 1980 he weighed . He then began a diet in which he lost in 10 months. In 1982 he co-authored the book A Question of Weight with his close friend, the photographer Veronique Skawinska, in which he dealt candidly with his struggles with obesity. Roussos died in the morning of 25 January 2015, from stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer and liver cancer while hospitalised at Ygeia Hospital in Athens, Greece. His death was confirmed a day later by a friend, the journalist Nikos Aliagas, who tweeted the news on 26 January 2015 in both Greek and French. His death was also confirmed later on the same day by his daughter, who spoke to Greek and French media. Fellow Greek singer Nana Mouskouri paid tribute to Roussos on the French radio station RTL, saying \\"He had a superb voice, he travelled in the world ... he loved what he was doing... He was an artist, a friend. I hope he is in a better world.\\" Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko said: ‚ÄúThis artist left a bright mark in the world music art and made history as one of the greatest singers, whose extremely emotional manner of singing caught the hearts of listeners all over the world ...\\" Roussos' funeral was held at the First Cemetery of Athens, the burial place of many Greek politicians and cultural figures, on 30 January. The singer Mariza Koch said, \\"His was a voice which awakened emotions in people and honoured Greece wherever it reached. We bid farewell to Demis.\\" Composer Giorgos Hatzinasios commented, \\"I can still hear his heartfelt laugh in my ears and I want to bid farewell to him with nostalgia and love.\\" Personal life Roussos was married three or possibly four times. He had a daughter, Emily, with his first wife, Monique. With his second wife, Dominique, he had a son, Cyril. Both of Roussos' children are musicians. His third wife, the American model Pamela Smith, now Pamela Roussos-Ra»õiu (wife of the Romanian businessman Indrei Ra»õiu, married in 2004), was with him during the 1985 TWA plane hijacking incident.FOTO Ostatici √Æntr-un avion deturnat de Hezbollah: via≈£a de film a Pamelei Ra≈£iu alƒÉturi de fostul so≈£, Demis Roussos, AdevƒÉrul, His fourth, and last, wife was a Parisian named Marie. Roussos listed Mozart and Sting among his favourite composers.  In popular culture  Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon take turns trying to imitate Roussos' falsetto in \\"Forever and Ever\\" as they drive through the Greek countryside in the 2020 film, The Trip to Greece. Roussos is the subject of an argument between two main characters in Mike Leigh's 1977 play Abigail's Party. On the day of Roussos' death, actress Alison Steadman was interviewed by BBC Radio 4's PM and discussed the significance of the music in the play. On 15 June 2016, his children Emily and Cyril opened the Demis Roussos Museum in Nijkerk, Netherlands. After his death, the curator initiated the procedure to move the museum to Greece, \\"Roussos' birthplace\\". The Bollywood song \\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\\" from the film Sholay) is based on Roussos \\"Say You Love Me\\". In an interview, its director Ramesh Sippy related attending a Roussos concert in London. His wife asked him to incorporate this song into Sholay's music track. The character of Pancham (played by R. D. Burman) used empty bottles as a part of the music in this version of the song.

In geometry, a hypocycloid is a special plane curve generated by the trace of a fixed point on a small circle that rolls within a larger circle. It is comparable to the cycloid but instead of the circle rolling along a line, it rolls within a circle. Properties If the smaller circle has radius r, and the larger circle has radius R = kr, then the parametric equations for the curve can be given by either: :x (\\\\theta) = (R - r) \\\\cos \\\\theta + r \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{R-r}{r} \\\\theta \\\\right) :y (\\\\theta) = (R - r) \\\\sin \\\\theta - r \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{R - r}{r} \\\\theta \\\\right), or: :x (\\\\theta) = r (k - 1) \\\\cos \\\\theta + r \\\\cos \\\\left( (k - 1) \\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\, :y (\\\\theta) = r (k - 1) \\\\sin \\\\theta - r \\\\sin \\\\left( (k - 1) \\\\theta \\\\right). \\\\, If k is an integer, then the curve is closed, and has k cusps (i.e., sharp corners, where the curve is not differentiable). Specially for k=2 the curve is a straight line and the circles are called Cardano circles. Girolamo Cardano was the first to describe these hypocycloids and their applications to high-speed printing. If k is a rational number, say k = p/q expressed in simplest terms, then the curve has p cusps. If k is an irrational number, then the curve never closes, and fills the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius R ‚àí 2r. Each hypocycloid (for any value of r) is a brachistochrone for the gravitational potential inside a homogeneous sphere of radius R. The area enclosed by a hypocycloid is given by: :A = \\\\frac {(k - 1)(k - 2)} {k^2} \\\\pi R^2 = (k - 1)(k - 2) \\\\pi r^2 The arc length of a hypocycloid is given by: :s = \\\\frac {8(k - 1)} {k} R = 8(k - 1) r Examples Image:Hypocycloid-3.svg k=3 ‚Äî a deltoid Image:Hypocycloid-4.svg k=4 ‚Äî an astroid Image:Hypocycloid-5.svg k=5 Image:Hypocycloid-6.svg k=6 Image:Hypocycloid-2-1.svg k=2.1 = 21/10 Image:Hypocycloid-3-8.svg k=3.8 = 19/5 Image:Hypocycloid-5-5.svg k=5.5 = 11/2 Image:Hypocycloid-7-2.svg k=7.2 = 36/5 The hypocycloid is a special kind of hypotrochoid, which is a particular kind of roulette. A hypocycloid with three cusps is known as a deltoid. A hypocycloid curve with four cusps is known as an astroid. The hypocycloid with two cusps is a degenerate but still very interesting case, known as the Tusi couple. Relationship to group theory Hypocycloids \\"rolling\\" inside one another. The cusps of each of the smaller curves maintain continuous contact with the next-larger hypocycloid. Any hypocycloid with an integral value of k, and thus k cusps, can move snugly inside another hypocycloid with k+1 cusps, such that the points of the smaller hypocycloid will always be in contact with the larger. This motion looks like 'rolling', though it is not technically rolling in the sense of classical mechanics, since it involves slipping. Hypocycloid shapes can be related to special unitary groups, denoted SU(k), which consist of k √ó k unitary matrices with determinant 1. For example, the allowed values of the sum of diagonal entries for a matrix in SU(3), are precisely the points in the complex plane lying inside a hypocycloid of three cusps (a deltoid). Likewise, summing the diagonal entries of SU(4) matrices gives points inside an astroid, and so on. Thanks to this result, one can use the fact that SU(k) fits inside SU(k+1) as a subgroup to prove that an epicycloid with k cusps moves snugly inside one with k+1 cusps. Derived curves The evolute of a hypocycloid is an enlarged version of the hypocycloid itself, while the involute of a hypocycloid is a reduced copy of itself. The pedal of a hypocycloid with pole at the center of the hypocycloid is a rose curve. The isoptic of a hypocycloid is a hypocycloid. Hypocycloids in popular culture Curves similar to hypocycloids can be drawn with the Spirograph toy. Specifically, the Spirograph can draw hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The Pittsburgh Steelers' logo, which is based on the Steelmark, includes three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). In his weekly NFL.com column \\"Tuesday Morning Quarterback,\\" Gregg Easterbrook often refers to the Steelers as the Hypocycloids. Chilean soccer team CD Huachipato based their crest on the Steelers' logo, and as such features hypocycloids. The first Drew Carey season of The Price Is Right's set features astroids on the three main doors, giant price tag, and the turntable area. The astroids on the doors and turntable were removed when the show switched to high definition broadcasts starting in 2008, and only the giant price tag prop still features them today. http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/08/21/a-glimpse-at-drew-careys-price-is-right/ See also * Roulette (curve) * Special cases: Astroid, Deltoid * List of periodic functions * Cyclogon * Epicycloid * Hypotrochoid * Epitrochoid * Spirograph * Flag of Portland, Oregon, featuring a hypocycloid References * External links  A free Javascript tool for generating Hypocyloid curves *Animation of Epicycloids, Pericycloids and Hypocycloids * Plot Hypcycloid -- GeoFun * Iterative demonstration showing the brachistochrone property of Hypocycloid Roulettes (curve) ","title":"Hypocycloid"},{"id":"592743","text":"Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the chemical process of combustion.

After playing college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, he was selected by the Steelers in the first round of the 1972 NFL Draft, the 13th overall pick. He played his first 12 years in the NFL with the Steelers; his 13th and final year was spent with the Seahawks. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. Early life Harris was born in Fort Dix, New Jersey. His African-American father, Cad Harris, served in World War II and was stationed in Italy during the war. His Caucasian mother, Gina Parenti Harris, was a native Italian and became a \\"war bride\\", who moved with her husband when he returned to the United States after the end of the war. \\"Franco Harris: still goal-bound 'He has always known where he wanted to go'\\", by Sean Somerville, Baltimore Sun, September 22, 1996 \\"Black and Gold Soul with Italian Legs\\", Sports Illustrated, December 11, 1972. Harris graduated from Rancocas Valley Regional High School in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey in 1968 and then attended Penn State University. While playing for Penn State's Nittany Lions, Harris served primarily as a blocker for the All-American running back Lydell Mitchell, though he amassed 2,002 yards rushing with 24 touchdowns and averaged over 5 yards per carry, while also catching 28 passes for 352 yards and another touchdown. He led the team in scoring in 1970. *1969: 115 carries for 643 yards and 10 touchdowns. 12 catches for 189 yards. *1970: 142 carries for 675 yards and 8 touchdowns. 6 catches for 66 yards. *1971: 123 carries for 684 yards and 6 touchdowns. 10 catches for 97 yards and 1 touchdown. Professional career In his first season with the Steelers (1972), Harris was named the league's Rookie of the Year by both The Sporting News and United Press International. In that season he gained 1,055 yards on 188 carries, with a 5.6 yards per carry average. He also rushed for 10 touchdowns and caught four touchdown passes. He was popular with Pittsburgh's large Italian-American population: his fans, including \\"Brigadier General\\" Frank Sinatra, dubbed themselves \\"Franco's Italian Army\\" and wore army helmets with his number on them. Harris was chosen for nine consecutive Pro Bowls (1972‚Äì1980), and was All-Pro in 1977. Harris rushed for more than 1,000 yards in eight seasons, breaking a record set by Jim Brown. The running back tandem of Harris and Rocky Bleier combined with a strong defense to win four Super Bowls following the 1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979 seasons. On January 12, 1975 he was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl IX; in that game he rushed for 158 yards and a touchdown on 34 carries for a 16-6 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Harris was the first African American as well as the first Italian-American to be named Super Bowl MVP. Harris was a major contributor for the Steelers in all of their first four Super Bowl wins. His Super Bowl career totals of 101 carries for 354 yards are records and his four career rushing touchdowns are tied for the second most in Super Bowl history. Harris claims he extended his career and thus his contribution to the team's objectives (including four Super Bowl victories) by avoiding unnecessary contact. Harris rushing the ball for the Steelers in Super Bowl XIV With the retirement of O.J. Simpson after the 1979 season, Harris became the career rushing leader among active players. Following the 1983 season, Harris and Walter Payton were both closing in on Jim Brown's NFL rushing record, and Harris asked the Rooney family for a pay raise. The Rooney family refused, believing that Harris was on the downside of his career, and Harris threatened to hold out. The Steelers released Harris in training camp in 1984 and he eventually signed with the Seattle Seahawks during the 1984 season. He played just eight games with the team, gaining only 170 yards before retiring (192 yards short of Jim Brown's record). In his 13 professional seasons, Harris gained 12,120 yards (then 3rd all-time) on 2,949 carries, a 4.1 yards per carry average, and scored 91 rushing touchdowns (then also 3rd). He caught 307 passes for 2,287 yards, a 7.4 yards per reception average, and nine receiving touchdowns. Harris's 12,120 career rushing yards rank him 12th all time in the NFL, while his 91 career rushing touchdowns rank him 10th all time tied with Jerome Bettis. Harris and the Rooneys reconciled after Harris retired; in 2006, during pre-game ceremonies for Super Bowl XL (the Steelers' second SB appearance ‚Äì and first championship ‚Äì since his retirement) honoring the MVPs of the previous 39 games, Harris waved a Terrible Towel while being introduced, much to the delight of the overwhelmingly pro-Steeler crowd. While the Steelers have only officially retired two uniform numbers (Ernie Stautner's number 70 and Joe Greene's number 75), they have not reissued his number 32 since he left the team, and it is generally understood that no Steelers player will ever wear that number again. Harris was a key player in one of professional football's most famous plays, dubbed \\"The Immaculate Reception\\" by Pittsburgh sportscaster Myron Cope. In a 1972 playoff game, the Oakland Raiders were leading the Steelers 7-6 with 22 seconds to play when a Terry Bradshaw pass was deflected away from intended receiver John \\"Frenchy\\" Fuqua right as defender Jack Tatum arrived to tackle Fuqua. Harris snatched the ball just before it hit the ground and ran it into the endzone to win the game. The Raiders challenged the touchdown, claiming that Fuqua had handled the ball before Harris, which would invalidate the score because at that time it was against the rules for two offensive receivers to touch the ball. The Steelers maintained that the ball had touched Tatum instead. According to a recounting by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the film of the play is inconclusive. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano attempted to criticize Harris's achievement by stating that he was only in position to catch the ball because he was lazy, but replays show that Harris headed downfield when the Raiders forced Bradshaw out of the pocket, and can be clearly seen running before catching the deflected ball. Statue of Harris making the \\"Immaculate Reception\\" at Pittsburgh International Airport. In 1999, he was ranked number 83 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2006, The Heinz History Center, home of the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, installed a life-size figure of Harris in the grand concourse of Pittsburgh International Airport. The statue is a recreation of Harris's \\"Immaculate Reception.\\" He was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011. Post- football Harris and Lydell Mitchell, successful college teammates at Penn State, now own Super Bakery, a company founded in 1990 to produce nutrition- oriented foods for schoolchildren. The business was renamed to RSuper Foods in 2006. RSuper foods produces the Super Donut that has been served to students at public schools in the eastern United States. Harris and Mitchell also partnered in 1996 to rescue the Parks Sausage Company in Baltimore, the first African-American owned business to go public in the U.S. Harris is also a paid representative for the Harrah's/Forest City Enterprises casino plan for downtown Pittsburgh.Forest City Enterprises : Press Releases This association has earned him the tongue-in-cheek nickname, \\"Franco Harrahs\\". On July 9, 2006, Harris made an appearance in the 2006 Taco Bell \\"All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game\\" at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. In August 2008, Harris attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention, in Denver, Colorado, as part of the Pennsylvania delegation.AP News Wire, Associated Press News Harris voted for Obama on December 15, 2008, as one of Pennsylvania's 21 Democratic presidential electors. In January 2011, Harris became co-owner of the Pittsburgh Passion. In John Grisham's 2008 novel Playing For Pizza, the fullback of the Parma Panthers is nicknamed Franco as a tribute to his hero, Franco Harris, who he refers to as the \\"greatest Italian football player\\". This is a reference to Franco's mixed racial heritage. Harris briefly worked with The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in 2011, before the casino suspended the relationship after Harris' comments in support of Joe Paterno, his coach while at Penn State, during the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.Schilken, Chuck, \\"Franco Harris loses job for comments supporting Joe Paterno\\", Los Angeles Times, November 16, 2011 9:32 am.

The film stars Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, Jason Gedrick and J. T. Walsh. It is about Chicago firefighters on the trail of a serial arsonist. Filming in Chicago began in July 23, 1990 and was wrapped up on December 8, 1990. Before the filming was started, the main actors went out on calls with real Chicago firefighters, all of the main actors also went to the Chicago Fire Academy to learn how to be like firefighters in the movie. The film was released on May 24, 1991 to favorable reviews from critics, and it grossed $77.9 million domestically and $74.5 million in foreign markets, for a total gross of $152.4 million. The film received three Oscar nominations. The film also inspired a Universal Studios Hollywood special effects attraction based on the film. It was also the first time that a Universal Studios theme park attraction was based on an R-rated film, which it was closed on April 11, 2010. A sequel, Backdraft 2, was released 28 years later on May 14, 2019. Plot Two firefighters of Engine 17 of the Chicago Fire Department are brothers. Lt. Stephen \\"Bull\\" McCaffrey, the elder, is experienced, while Brian has labored under his brother's shadow his entire life. Brian returns to firefighting after a number of other careers falter, though Stephen has doubts that Brian is still fit to be a firefighter. In 1971, Brian witnessed the death of their firefighting father, Captain Dennis McCaffrey, while accompanying him on a call. The longest-serving of all the men at Engine 17, John \\"Axe\\" Adcox, served under the McCaffreys' father, and was like an uncle to the boys when their father died. Adcox grows concerned about Stephen's unorthodox methods and disregard for safety procedures, as does Stephen's wife Helen, separating from Stephen to protect herself and their son Sean. Fire Department Captain Donald \\"Shadow\\" Rimgale, a dedicated arson investigator and veteran firefighter, is called in because a number of recent explosive fires resemble those set by pyromaniac Ronald Bartel, who has been imprisoned for years. Brian is reassigned as his assistant after a falling out with Stephen. Rimgale manipulates Ronald's obsession with fire to ensure his annual parole application is rejected. It is revealed during an investigation that Chicago City Council alderman Swayzak, who has supported fire department budget cuts, was paid off by contractors to shut down firehouses so they could be converted into community centers, with the contractors receiving contracts for the construction. Brian also rekindles a relationship with Jennifer Vaitkus, an aide to Swayzak. When Engine 17 answers a call in a high-rise, Stephen urges them to move in quickly, despite Adcox's advice to wait for back-up. Brian's friend and fellow trainee, Tim Krizminski, opens a door, triggering a backdraft. His face is burned beyond recognition, and he barely survives. Adcox and Brian both condemn Stephen for what happened. Rimgale and Brian go to Swayzak's home to confront him after learning of his connection to the three backdraft victims Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove and Jeffery Holcomb, interrupting a masked man about to set the place on fire. The latter attacks them with a flashlight but is burned on his shoulder by an electrical socket. Rimgale saves Brian and Swayzak from the house but is injured in an explosion. In his hospital bed, Rimgale tells Brian to visit Ronald again, who helps Brian realize that only a firefighter would be so careful as to not let backdraft fires rage out of control. Brian suspects Stephen but spots a burn in the shape of an electrical socket on Adcox's back, revealing his suspicions to his brother just before an alarm. When Brian realizes that Adcox has heard their exchange, he jumps aboard Truck 46 after borrowing some turnout gear. Stephen confronts Adcox about the backdrafts during a multiple-alarm fire at a chemical plant. Adcox admits that he set the fires to kill Swayzak's associates, because Swayzak was benefiting from the deaths of firefighters and closing down firehouses. When an explosion destroys the catwalk they are on, Stephen grabs Adcox's hand while hanging on to the remains of the catwalk. Stephen refuses Adcox's advice to let go of him, and loses his grip on the catwalk. Stephen lands on the floor, but Adcox dies when he falls into fire. Stephen dies with Brian by his side on the way to the hospital, with his final request being that Brian must not reveal Adcox to be the perpetrator so as not to hurt the fire department's reputation. After Stephen and Adcox's funeral, Brian and Rimgale, with the help of the police, interrupt Swayzak at a press conference. Rimgale questions Swayzak on a fake manpower study that led to the deaths of several firemen, including Stephen and Adcox. They also state that Swayzak engineered the downsizing of the Chicago Fire Department, destroying Swayzak's mayoral ambitions. Brian continues as a firefighter, despite the loss of his father and brother. The film ends as Brian helps a rookie firefighter with his turnout gear as the department responds to a call. Cast Production According to the article in Entertainment Weekly, rubber cement from Petronio Shoe Products was used to create some of the fire effects. Industrial Light & Magic created many of the visual effects. =Realism= Fire fighting professionals have noted that most real structure fires differ from what is shown in the movie by having smoke conditions that obscure vision inside the building almost completely. > The pictures of firefighters searching in movies like Backdraft do not > really show what it is like to search in a fire. Firefighters are shown > advancing through fully involved structure fires while not wearing the > complete complement of protective gear (Nomex hoods, radios, PASS devices). > Most scenes display firefighting without the use of SCBA [ self contained > breathing apparatus ]. Realism in our case would make a very bad movie > because the fact is that in almost every fire the smoke conditions > completely obscure all vision. \\"The movie ... came pretty close at times, but it also suffered from the very same, all too common shortcomings that any visual presentation was bound to encounter (...) Smoke, steam and other miscellaneous factors usually combine to obscure almost everything that is taking place\\".Jerry E. Lindsay: \\"A Firefighter's Story\\", pp. 52-53. Furthermore, fire investigation professionals have dismissed the investigative methods shown in the movie as unscientific, in particular, the portrayal of fire as a living entity.

Early life and career He was born in Copenhagen on April 3, 1769, to Count Andreas Peter von Bernstorff. He was educated for the diplomatic service under his father's direction. He began his career in 1787, as attach√© to the representative of Denmark at the opening of the Diet of Sweden. In 1789, he went as secretary of legation to Berlin, where his maternal uncle, Count Leopold Friedrich zu Stolberg, was Danish ambassador. His uncle's influence, as well as his own social qualities, obtained him rapid promotion; he was soon charg√© d'affaires, and in 1791 minister plenipotentiary. In 1794, he exchanged this post for the important one of ambassador at Stockholm, where he remained until May 1797, when he was summoned to Copenhagen to act as substitute for his father during his illness. On the death of the latter (June 21), he succeeded him as secretary of state for foreign affairs and privy councillor. In 1800, he became head of the ministry. He remained responsible for the foreign policy of Denmark until May 1810, a fateful period which saw the battle of Copenhagen (April 2, 1801), the bombardment of Copenhagen, and the capture of the Danish fleet in 1807. After his retirement, he remained without office until his appointment in 1811 as Danish ambassador at Vienna. He remained here, despite Denmark being nominally at war with Austria, until, in January 1814, on the accession of Denmark to the coalition against Napoleon, he publicly resumed his functions as ambassador. He accompanied the emperor Francis to Paris, and was present at the signature of the first peace of Paris. With his brother Joachim, he represented Denmark at the Congress of Vienna and, as a member for the commission for the regulation of the affairs of the German confederation, was responsible for some of that confusion of Danish and German interests which was to bear bitter fruit later in the Schleswig-Holstein question. He again accompanied the allied sovereigns to Paris in 1815, returning to Copenhagen the same year. In 1817, he was appointed Danish ambassador at Berlin, his brother Joachim going at the same time to Vienna. Prussian service In the following year, Prince Hardenberg made him the formal proposition that he should transfer his services to Prussia, which, with the leave of his sovereign, he did. It was, therefore, as a Prussian diplomat that Bernstorff attended the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (October 1818), at the close of which he returned to Berlin as minister of state and head of the department for foreign affairs. Bernstorff's management of Prussian policy throughout the many years that he remained in office has been variously judged. He was by training and temperament against the Revolution, and he was initiated into his new duties as a Prussian minister by the reactionary Ancillon. He is accused of having subordinated the particular interests of Prussia to the European policy of Metternich and the Holy Alliance. Whether any other policy would in the long run have served Prussia better is a matter for speculation. It is true that Bernstorff backed the Carlsbad Decrees, and the Vienna Final Act; he was also the faithful henchman of Metternich at the congresses of Laibach, Troppau and Verona. On the other hand, he took a considerable share in laying the groundwork of the customs union (Zollverein), which was destined to be the foundation of the Prussian hegemony in Germany. In his support of Russia's action against Turkey in 1828 also he showed that he was no blind follower of Mettenich's views. In the crisis of 1830 his moderation in face of the warlike clamour of the military party at Berlin did much to prevent the troubles in Belgium and Poland from ending in a universal European conflagration. From 1824 onward, Bernstorff had been a constant sufferer from hereditary gout, intensified and complicated by the results of overwork. In the spring of 1832, the state of his health compelled him to resign the ministry of foreign affairs to Ancillon, who had already acted as his deputy for a year. He died in 1835.

From 1981 to 1987 he was the main presenter for the Nine O'Clock News, the flagship BBC News television programme, and from 1987 until 2019 he presented on the BBC Radio 4 breakfast programme Today. Since 2003 he has been the host of the BBC Two television quiz show Mastermind. Humphrys has a reputation as a tenacious and forthright interviewer; occasionally politicians have been very critical of his style after being subjected to a tough interview on live radio. Humphrys has been described as \\"a natural liberal\\".  Early life and career  Humphrys was born in a working-class environment in Cardiff at 193 Pearl Street, Adamsdown, son of Winifred Mary (Matthews), a hairdresser, and Edward George Humphrys, a self-employed French polisher.The Daily Telegraph, 21 July 2007, \\"Family Detective\\" He was one of five children. During early life Humphrys had a bout of whooping cough and concerned that he would be known as 'Dismal Desmond', his mother opted to use the name John. His parents encouraged him to do his homework and he passed the eleven plus exam. He became a pupil at Cardiff High School (then a grammar school), but he did not fit into the middle class environment there. He was an average pupil and left school at 15, choosing not to go to university and instead became a reporter with the Penarth Times. The weekly newspaper that employed him served the town of Penarth, which is an seaside resort located south of Cardiff, in South Wales and focused on local news. Humphrys later joined the Western Mail, a larger regional newspaper based in Cardiff. He joined Television Wales and the West (TWW), a commercial television channel based in Wales, and was the first reporter on the scene of the Aberfan disaster, which killed 144 people and destroyed entire parts of an town, in October 1966.  Career at the BBC  Humphrys joined the BBC later in 1966 as the district reporter for Liverpool and the Northwest, where he reported on the dock strikes of that time, sometimes for the national news. He then worked as a foreign correspondent, initially having to go abroad and leave his family for six to nine-month periods at a time when his children were still young and growing up. Later he took his family with him to the United States and South Africa where he was sent to open a news bureau. He reported the resignation of president Richard Nixon in 1974 on television by satellite from the United States, the execution of Gary Gilmore in 1977, and later, when based in South Africa, he reported on the end of Rhodesia and the creation of the new nation of Zimbabwe. Humphrys became disillusioned with living in hotels and life on-the-road as a foreign correspondent, and returned to London in 1980 to take up the post of BBC Diplomatic Correspondent. In 1981 he became the main presenter of the BBC's flagship Nine O'Clock News. This appointment marked a change in the BBC's approach to news broadcasting. With the appointment of Humphrys and John Simpson, the presenters of the news became part of the process of preparing the broadcast, rather than just reading a prepared script as with previous presenters. In addition to this, Humphrys also briefly read the midweek classified football results. Humphrys began presenting Today in January 1987, joining Brian Redhead. He still made occasional appearances fronting BBC Television news bulletins in the 1990s. During the 1991 Gulf War he was a volunteer presenter on the BBC Radio 4 News FM service. From 1993 he presented the weekly On The Record political TV show until its demise in 2002. Humphrys has also presented Panorama. Humphrys is the presenter of the revived version of the game show Mastermind. He became the programme's fourth regular host in 2003, succeeding Magnus Magnusson, Peter Snow and Clive Anderson. Humphrys is an agnostic, but has said that he has a curiosity to test his agnosticism and challenge established religions to see if they can restore his childhood belief in God. In 2006, he presented a BBC Radio 4 programme, titled Humphrys in Search of God where he spoke to leading British authorities on Christianity, Judaism and Islam to try to restore his faith. Archived link. On 12 November 2009, he became a temporary replacement for David Dimbleby as the host of Question Time when Dimbleby was recovering from an injury. On 3 January 2011, Humphrys announced that he had extended his contract to present the Today programme, but in doing so had agreed to a pay cut. In 2014, he appeared as himself in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern. Humphry's interview with the Director-General of the BBC George Entwistle on 11 November 2012 on the Today programme was widely reported to have been a major factor in Entwistle's resignation later that day. In the interview, Entwistle admitted he was unaware of a Newsnight investigation which wrongly accused a senior Conservative figure of child abuse until after it was broadcast. The report came about during the unfolding of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, which was also considered a factor that contributed to Entwistle's resignation. On the day of the interview, Humphrys' co-presenter James Naughtie recalled \\"It was electric in that studio. There were three of us sitting there, George, John and me. And I think all three of us knew we could see a man destroying his own job, on the spot. He was at sea. And it was a deeply uncomfortable 10 minutes.\\" Humphrys later said: \\"I know it was said in the papers the following morning that he had been humiliated. I didn't set out to humiliate him, of course I didn't.\\" In a March 2014 interview with the Radio Times, Humphrys noted some of the biases at the BBC, describing it as \\"broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative\\". He highlighted failing in coverage of issues of Europe and immigration, stating: \\"We weren't sufficiently sceptical ‚Äì that's the most accurate phrase ‚Äì of the pro-European case. We bought into the European ideal. We weren't sufficiently sceptical about the pro-immigration argument. We didn't look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour.\\" In February 2019 Humphrys announced that he was to leave the Today programme, saying that he should have quit \\"years ago\\". He hosted his final edition on 19 September, where his interviewees were Tony Blair, Dame Edna Everage and David Cameron.  Other interests  Humphrys has written several books, including Lost for Words, in which he criticises what he sees as the widespread misuse of the English language, plus Devil's Advocate, Beyond Words, The Great Food Gamble and In God We Doubt: Confessions of a Failed Atheist. In September 2019, he released his memoir, A Day Like Today, which included his views on the internal political climate at the BBC. He played himself in the 2013 crime thriller film Closed Circuit with Eric Bana playing the lead. After leaving the BBC, Humphrys joined the Daily Mail as a weekly columnist and became a presenter on Classic FM on Sunday afternoons between 3 pm and 5 pm.https://www.classicfm.com/radio/john- humphrys-to-present-sunday-afternoons/ Humphrys is a keen gardener who makes his home-made compost and uses his own urine to water his lawn.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/how-to-grow/studio-garden-john- humphrys-talks-weeds-no-dig-love-sir- david/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/john-humphrys-talks-today-the-bbc- pay-row-and-greta- thunberg-0crml66fbhttps://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/26/gardening- secret-of-happiness-julie-myerson  Political views  Humphrys has been described as a \\"natural liberal\\" and does not view himself as conservative, saying; \\"I am not conservative, you know. I am genuinely one of those pathetic people who has very strong views about issues\\". He also stated that he his political views are heavily influenced by what he sees and talks to as a reporter. \\"So every other bloody week I change my mind about something or other, and when you vote, you look for the party that comes closest to what you believe.\\" When asked if he was happy with having the extracts of his books published in the Daily Mail, Humphreys responded saying: \\"Yes. They did and they not only did that, but they also sought my approval. I was not particularly happy with the splash [the headline] the Mail used, but you know‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck whether people think that a particular newspaper is biased in this way or that way. All I‚Äôm concerned with is that my material is presented in the way I‚Äôve written it and they didn‚Äôt change a word.\\" He also responded to a further question titled \\"Do you understand why some people don‚Äôt like the Daily Mail?\\" saying that he has always read the Daily Mail simply because it reaches an awful lot of people. And that is may not always be compatible with his own views, but said that he also thinks the same about The Guardian, which hosted the interview. He views himself as feminist: ‚ÄúI detest the word feminism, because of course I‚Äôm a feminist,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúGod, why does one have to say it? Obviously, obviously‚Ä¶ Racism is a profoundly moral issue, as is feminism. That‚Äôs why I refused to wear one of those ‚ÄúThis is what a feminist looks like‚Äù T-shirts. No, it isn't. This is what a white man looks like, who happens to believe that women are equal to men. I mean, even saying it makes you sound like a dickhead.‚Äù  Personal life  Humphrys married Edna Wilding (August 1942 ‚Äì September 1997) in 1964 and they had two children, a son and daughter, Christopher and Catherine. Their marriage broke down in the late 1980s. Wilding died of cancer in Glamorgan, South Wales; Humphrys described her last days in a hospice in his book Devil's Advocate (2000). Humphrys' son Christopher is now a professional cellist. On 2 June 2000, when he was 56 years old, Humphrys and his then partner, Valerie Sanderson, had a son, Owen James. Sanderson was a newsreader with Spotlight then BBC News 24 and is now a radio producer. Humphrys had a reverse vasectomy. He referred to these facts on 31 October 2006 on BBC Radio 4 in the programme Humphrys in Search of God. He and Sanderson subsequently separated. In 2009, he began a relationship with the journalist Catherine Bennett, a contributor to The Observer. In 2005 he founded the Kitchen Table Charities Trust, a charity that funds projects to help some of the poorest people anywhere in the world; it not only helps the most vulnerable but, in the longer term, \\"helps the country to stand on its own feet.\\" Humphrys is a keen listener to classical music and cites Mozart, Beethoven and Bach as particular favourites, although he once saw The Rolling Stones in concert and said \\"they blew me away\\". He was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs on 6 January 2008. His favourite record of the eight he selected for the show was Elgar‚Äôs Cello Concerto; he chose the biggest poetry anthology possible as his book and, as his luxury item, a cello. Humphrys' brother, Bob Humphrys, was a sports television presenter on BBC Wales Today. He died of lung cancer in Cardiff on 19 August 2008, aged 56. In December 2013 Humphrys was featured in an episode of the BBC Wales series Coming Home, together with his older brother Graham. It was revealed that their great-grandmother Sarah Willey was, from the age of six, resident at the Cardiff workhouse and that their paternal great-grandfather was from Finland.  Awards  Humphrys has won a number of industry awards, including being named Journalist of the Year in February 2000 at an awards ceremony organised by The House and Channel 4, the Gold Sony Radio Award in 2003, and a silver platter for Crystal Clear Broadcasting from the Plain English Campaign. He holds an honorary degree from Abertay University, which is located in the Scottish city of Dundee, Scotland  Bibliography     References   External links  John Humphrys on Classic FM * ‚Äì BBC Video of John Humphrys' house from The One Show * John Humphrys ‚Äì Today profile * Telegraph October 2006 * Independent October 2005 * Independent March 2005 1943 births Living people BBC newsreaders and journalists BBC Radio 4 presenters Welsh agnostics British game show hosts Welsh television journalists Welsh radio presenters Welsh television presenters Journalists from Cardiff People from Splott ","title":"John Humphrys"},{"id":"592788","text":"Wen Tsing Chow (; 1918‚Äì2001), was a Chinese-born American missile guidance scientist and a digital computer pioneer, known for the invention of programmable read-only memory or PROM. Biography Chow was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi in 1918. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in 1940 and an M.S. in EE from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1942. Chow, working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation, pioneered the use of digital computers in missile, satellite and spacecraft guidance systems, leading the design of the United States Air Force Atlas E/F ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) all-inertial guidance system and guidance computer, the first production airborne digital computer. Mr. Chow personally formulated the design of the first all solid state, high reliability, space-borne digital computer and established the basic systems approach and mechanization of America's ICBM guidance systems. Chow invented and holds a fundamental patent on what is now commonly known as programmable read-only memory or PROM. PROM, in the late 1950s called a \\"constants storage matrix,\\" was invented for the Atlas E/F ICBM airborne digital computer. He would continue working throughout the 1960s and early 1970s to develop and advance missile and spacecraft digital computers and guidance systems technology beyond the state of the art - working at the Aerospace Corporation in the Gemini and Minuteman programs and at IBM in the B-1, B-52, Saturn V and Skylab programs, and of course, in the development of the AP-101 digital computer used in the Space Shuttle Computer Complex. Chow, uniquely, worked on the guidance computers and guidance systems for every major United States Air Force ICBM and NASA manned space program from the very beginning with the Atlas, through Titan, Gemini, Saturn, and Skylab, to missiles and spacecraft still in service today, Minuteman and the Space Shuttle. In 2004, the United States Air Force posthumously awarded Mr. Chow one of their highest awards, the Air Force Space and Missiles Pioneers Award, previously held by only 30 individuals.

The Danish East India CompanyThe Danish East India Company () refers to two separate Danish- Norwegian chartered companies. The first company operated between 1616 and 1650. The second company existed between 1670 and 1729, however, in 1730 it was re-founded as the Asiatic Company (). First company Fort Dansborg at Tranquebar, built by Ove Gedde in 1620. The first Danish East India Company was chartered in 1616 under King Christian IV and focused on trade with India. The first expedition, under Admiral Gjedde, took two years to reach Ceylon, losing more than half their crew. The island had been claimed by Portugal by the time they arrived but on 10May 1620, a treaty was concluded with the Kingdom of Kandy and the foundation laid of a settlement at Trincomalee on the island's east coast. They occupied the colossal Koneswaram temple in May 1620 to begin fortification of the peninsula before being expelled by the Portuguese., pp. 11-12; , note n¬∞ 66, p. 326: \\"Senarat of Kandy sent to Trincomalee 60 Sinhala men in order to help the Danes in the construction of their fort. During their permanence in Trincomalee, the Danesh coined also some \\"Larins\\", on which were recorded the words ‚ÄòDon Erich Grubbe‚Äô, of these coins, today do not remain trace, if not in the diary of Ove Giedde.\\" After landing on the Indian mainland, a treaty was concluded with the ruler of the Tanjore Kingdom, Raghunatha Nayak, who gave the Danes possession of the town of Tranquebar, and permission to trade in the kingdom by treaty of 19November 1620. In Tranquebar they established Dansborg and installed Captain Crappe as the first governor (opperhoved) of Danish India.Foreningen Trankebar. \\"Artikel om en tur fra Chennai til Trankebar\\". The treaty was renewed on 30July 1621, and afterwards renewed and confirmed on the 10May 1676, by Shivaji the founder of the Maratha Empire. During their heyday, the Danish East India Company and Swedish East India Company imported more tea than the British East India Company, smuggling 90% of it into England, where it could be sold at a huge profit. Between 1624-36, Danish trade extended to Surat, Bengal, Java, and Borneo, with factories in Masulipatam, Surat, Balasore and at Java, but subsequent European wars in which Denmark participated ruined the Company, and trade in India ceased entirely between 1643‚Äì69, during which time all previous acquisitions were lost except Tranquebar, which held out until aid from Denmark arrived in 1669. Second company, and the Asiatic Company In 1670, a second Danish East India Company was established, before it too was dissolved in 1729. In 1730, it was refounded as the Asiatic Company and opened trade with Qing China at Canton. The first expedition went badly, with Den gyldne L√∏ve lost with its cargo of silver off Ballyheigue, Ireland, on the outbound journey. Local landowners held the silver at their estate and pursued a salvage claim, but a gang of locals overpowered the Danish guard and made off with the hoard, causing a diplomatic row between Denmark-Norway and Britain.Foreningen Trankebar. \\"Brev fra England\\". With the royal licence conferred in 1732, the new company was granted a 40-year monopoly on all Danish trade east of the Cape of Good Hope. Before 1750, it sent 27 ships; 22 survived the journey to return to Copenhagen. In 1772, the company lost its monopoly and in 1779, Danish India became a crown colony. During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1801 and again in 1807, the British Navy attacked Copenhagen. As a consequence of the last attack, Denmark (one of few West European countries not occupied by Bonaparte), lost its entire fleet and the island of Helgoland (part of the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp), to Britain. In the East, when news of Anglo-Danish hostilities reached India, the British immediately seized seven Danish merchant ships on 28 January 1808 that were in the Hoogli. Denmark finally sold its remaining settlements in mainland India in 1845 and the Danish Gold Coast in 1850, both to the British.

It was discovered on 5 April 1995, by James Scotti and Robert Jedicke of Spacewatch (credited) at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, United States. It is named after Asbolus, a centaur in Greek mythology and measures approximately 80 kilometers in diameter.  Orbit and classification  Orbital perturbation: changes in Asbolus semi-major axis during the next 5500 years. After the encounter with Jupiter in 2700 years, the orbit becomes unpredictable. Centaurs have short dynamical lifetimes due to perturbations by the giant planets. Asbolus is estimated to have an orbital half-life of about 860 kiloannum. Asbolus is currently classified as a SN centaur since Saturn is considered to control the perihelion and Neptune controls the aphelion. It currently has a perihelion of 6.8 AU, so is also influenced by Jupiter. Centaurs with a perihelion less than 6.6 AU are very strongly influenced by Jupiter and for classification purposes are considered to have a perihelion under the control of Jupiter. In about ten thousand years, clones of the orbit of Asbolus suggest that its perihelion classification may come under the control of Jupiter. Predicting the overall orbit and position of Asbolus beyond a few thousand years is difficult because of errors in the known trajectory, error amplification by perturbations due to all of the gas giants, and the possibility of perturbation as a result of cometary outgassing and fragmentation. Compared to centaur 7066 Nessus, the orbit of Asbolus is currently much more chaotic.  Physical characteristics  No resolved images of it have ever been made, but in 1998 spectral analysis of its composition by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a fresh impact crater on its surface, less than 10 million years old. Centaurs are dark in colour, because their icy surfaces have darkened after long exposure to solar radiation and the solar wind. However, fresh craters excavate more reflective ice from below the surface, and that is what Hubble has detected on Asbolus.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Asbolus (Greek for \\"sooty\\", \\"the black one\\"), a centaur capable to read omens in the flight of birds. He provoked a bloodbath in which the centaurs Chiron and Pholus met their deaths at Heracles hands.

The word \\"cave\\" is usually used but \\"fortress\\", which has a similar appearance in writing, is used as well. Wilhelm Gesenius' work Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon to the Old Testament Scriptures provides notes supporting Adullam as meaning \\"a hiding place\\". Brown, Driver, and Briggs' Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament cite the Arabic word 'adula to mean \\"turn aside\\" and suggest Adullam to mean \\"retreat, refuge\\". During this period, David passed up several opportunities to kill Saul, who in turn was attempting to kill his young rival, whose followers believed had been chosen by God to succeed King Saul. David refused to fight unfairly, for instance by killing the bellicose Saul in his sleep. According to the Old Testament, God honored David's high ethical standards and soon King David and his Mighty Men who had once hidden in the Cave of Adullam, were renowned throughout Israel for their deeds of valor. The term \\"Cave of Adullam\\" has been used by political commentators referring to any small group remote from power but planning to return. Thus in Walter Scott's 1814 novel Waverley when the Jacobite rising of 1745 marches south through England, the Jacobite Baron of Bradwardine welcomes scanty recruits while remarking that they closely resemble David's followers at the Cave of Adullam; \\"videlicet, every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented\\". cite Waverley, chapter lvii.

With a population of 618,375 according to the 2010 census, it is also the 7th most-populous city in Argentina. The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the Valle de Lerma Metropolitan Area (Spanish: √Årea Metropolitana del Valle de Lerma, AMVL), which is home to over 50.9% of the population of Salta Province and also includes the municipalities of La Caldera, Vaqueros, Campo Quijano, Rosario de Lerma, Cerrillos, La Merced and San Lorenzo. Salta is the seat of the Capital Department, the most populous department in the province. Overview It is situated in the Lerma Valley, above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. The weather is warm and dry, with annual averages of of rainfall and an average temperature of ( in summer, in winter). January, February and March are the months with the greatest rainfall. During the spring, Salta is occasionally plagued by severe, week-long dust storms. Nicknamed Salta la Linda (\\"Salta the beautiful\\"), it has become a major tourist destination due to its old, colonial architecture, tourism friendliness, excellent weather and natural scenery of the valleys westward. Attractions in the city proper include the 18th century Cabildo, the neo-classical style Cathedral, and the 9 de julio central square along with San Bernardo hill and its surroundings. The city's museums exhibit a wide range of artifacts and art work from the native civilizations that flourished in the area (Salta is located in the southernmost region of what was the Inca empire, belonging to the Collasuyu, one of the four areas of the empire until the Spanish conquest), as well as from the 16th century Spanish conquest and the colonial and post-colonial periods. Salta used to be the starting point of the \\"Train to the Clouds\\" (Tren a las nubes), and on the way to red-soiled Cafayate, as well as to other nearby tourist destinations. The Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes Airport, southwest of the city, has regular domestic flights to Buenos Aires, Tucum√°n, C√≥rdoba, Puerto Iguaz√∫; and international flights to Asunci√≥n, Rio de Janeiro, Iquique, Lima, Panama and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. History Panoramic view of Salta in the 19th century. Salta was founded on April 16, 1582 by the Spanish conquistador Hernando de Lerma, who intended the settlement to be an outpost between Lima, Peru and Buenos Aires. The origin of the name Salta is a matter of conjecture, with several theories being advanced to explain it. During the war of independence, the city became a commercial and military strategic point between Per√∫ and the Argentine cities. Between 1816 and 1821, the city was led by local military leader General Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes, who under the command of General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, defended the city and surrounding area from Spanish forces coming from further north. Salta emerged from the War of Independence politically in disarray and financially bankrupt, a condition that lingered throughout much of the 19th century. However, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the arrival of Italian, Spanish and Arab immigrants, particularly Syrians and Lebanese, revived trade and agriculture all over the area while further enhancing the city's multicultural flavor. Climate Salta has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), and it is characterized by pleasant weather year-round. Located in the subtropical north, but at an altitude of 1,200 metres, Salta enjoys 4 distinct seasons: summers are warm with frequent thunderstorms, with daytime highs around and pleasant, refreshing nights around . Fall brings dry weather, pleasant days at around and mild nights at around . By winter, the dryness is extreme, with very few rain episodes. Nights are cool at on average, but daytime heating allows for high temperatures of . Snow is rare and frost is quite common, with temperatures reaching down to during the coldest nights. Spring brings sunny weather with warm days and mild nights: days range from with nights between . Salta's winters are rather warm for its elevation and far inland position for a location being just outside the tropics. Of the over of rain that Salta receives yearly, over 80% falls between December and March, when thunderstorms occur almost daily. During the rest of the year, blue skies dominate the region. Seemingly incessant summer thunderstorms greatly rejuvenate the surrounding mountainous landscape, making the various hills and mountainsides within the vicinity of the city green and lush once again. Salta receives 1863 hours of bright sunshine each year or about 5.1 hours per day. The highest recorded temperature was on November 28, 1972 while the lowest recorded temperature was on August 5, 1966. Attractions The city centre features a number of buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th and early 20th centuries. Clockwise around the Ninth of July Square are the neoclassical Cathedral Shrine, the French style Museum of Contemporary Art, the Cabildo (in former times, the city's town hall, nowadays a historical museum) and the neoclassical Museum of High Mountain Archaeology, which houses artifacts from the Inca civilization, including the mummies of three Inca children. The Plaza is almost completely surrounded by a gallery. Within walking distance of the 9th July Square are the Saint Francis Church and the city's three pedestrian streets: Alberdi, Florida and \\"Caseros\\". The three blocks in Balcarce street closest to the train station are now the centre of night life in Salta, with restaurants, pubs and caf√©s on both sidewalks and concerts every night. Rising in the east is San Bernardo Hill. Its summit, from which visitors can get a view of the city and the entire valley, can be reached by car, cable car or stairway.

The local culture, however, is a blend of Spanish and gaucho (mestizo, criollo, both indigenous and non-indigenous) traditions, lending the city a distinctive identity, somewhat different from the more European-like metropolises to the south. The city boasts three theatres, several museums (one of which exhibits the perfectly preserved bodies of c.500 year old Inca children sacrificed in the Andes to Inca gods), and a busy calendar of art exhibitions, shows, music festivals, and other cultural events. One of the main activities in Salta is the April Culture Festival, which lasts the entire month and offers a wide variety of activities such as cultural performances, a handcraft exposition, and live orchestral performances. Sports Salta residents, like most Argentines, are very enthusiastic about football. The most important local clubs are Juventud Antoniana, Gimnasia y Tiro de Salta, and Central Norte; many faithful fans follow each. These three clubs currently play in the third national division. Other locally popular sports include baseball (a game in which Salta players excel nationally), basketball, volleyball, rugby, and mountaineering. The main sporting venue in Salta is the Padre Ernesto Martearena Stadium; the Gimnasia y Tiro and Juventud Antoniana stadiums also see many athletic matches. The largest roofed facility in the city is the Ciudad de Salta Stadium, chiefly used for basketball, volleyball, and boxing. Over the last twenty years, Salta has played host to such high-profile international sporting events as the 1990 Basketball World Cup, the 1994 Camel Trophy, the 2002 Volleyball World Cup, and the 2009 Hockey Champions Challenge. The Argentina national rugby union team, the \\"Pumas\\", have played in Salta against Italy (2005),Argentina v Italy scorecard at Scrum.com England (2009),national teams Argentine rugby fans deserve annual Test, by Brendan Gallagher for The Telegraph (2013). and South Africa (2016.)

The city name is normally shortened as Catamarca. The city of , located above sea level, has 159,000 inhabitants (), with more than 200,000 counting the suburbia, what represents around 70% of the population of the province.  Overview  The city is located from Buenos Aires. The closest provincial capitals are La Rioja (), Tucum√°n () and Santiago del Estero (). Many pilgrims come to San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca to visit the Church of the Virgin of the Valley (1694), which contains a statue of Nuestra Se√±ora del Valle (Our Lady of the Valley). Catamarca is also the touristic centre of the province, with its colonial architecture, and serves as a hub to many touristic points and excursions, hiking, mountain-bike tours, horse riding, and wine tasting.  Transportation  San Fernando del Valle is served by Coronel Felipe Varela International Airport (CTC/SANC), with flights to Buenos Aires-AEP. History and politics An initial settlement, called Londres, was established here by Spanish colonists in 1558; a permanent settlement was not founded until 1683, by Fernando de Mendoza y Mate de Luna. Catamarca comes from Quechua meaning \\"fortress on the slope\\". The city, which had only 8,000 inhabitants in 1882 and was reached by a railway line in 1888, grew very slowly, and the region remained poor even in the middle of the 20th century. This situation was exacerbated by nepotism on the part of the ruling Saadi family, before they lost political power in the 1990s. In spite of this, the province remains still politically unstable, and a large part of its population lives in precarious conditions.  Climate  The warm semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSh) of Catamarca has an annual average of 20 ¬∞C with an average maximum temperature of in summer with several days typically exceeding , and an average minimum of in winter. Temperatures in the high mountains can drop down to . The Valle (valley) receives relatively little rainfall from summer thunderstorms; most of the precipitation is received in the form of snow on the high mountain tops surrounding the city. Economy Agriculture is San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca's chief economic activity; however, low rainfall makes irrigation necessary. Fruit and grapes are grown in the oasis areas near the city, and there is a considerable production of wine. Other local production includes preserves and handwoven ponchos. Cotton and cattle are important economically, as well as mining at the Farall√≥n Negro, Bajo de la Alumbrera and Capillitas mines where gold, silver, copper and tin.

Unlike typical sports and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, physical exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing. History The term \\"sports entertainment\\" was coined by World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) chairman Vince McMahon during the 1980s as a marketing term to describe the industry of professional wrestling, primarily to potential advertisers,https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/stephanie-mcmahon-explains- sports-entertainment-was-created-advertisers although precursors date back to February 1935, when Toronto Star sports editor Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as \\"sportive entertainment\\". In 1989 the WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as \\"sports entertainment\\" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport. Some sports entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings. Roller derby was presented as a popular form of sports entertainment in the 1970s, though modern versions are legitimate competition. Perceptions Sports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment, and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning.

According to the 2010 census, the population of the city proper was 291,720 inhabitants. It is the anchor of a larger metropolitan area, Greater Resistencia, which comprises at least three more municipalities for a total population of 387,340 as of 2010. This conurbation is the largest in the province, and the eleventh most populous in the country. It is located along the Negro River, a tributary of the much larger Paran√° River, opposite the city of Corrientes, Corrientes Province. The area was originally inhabited by Guaycuru aboriginals such as the Tobas. Their resistance to evangelisation postponed substantial European settlement until the late 19th century. Not until 1865 was a proper settlement established, and on January 27, 1878, Resistencia was formally established as the territorial capital. The national government supported immigration, and in 1878 the first Italian immigrants arrived. The first City Council was made up entirely of members originating from that country. History =The Colonial Period= The area where Resistencia lies was the site of the Guaycuru peoples, pedestrian tribes that live on hunting and fishing. Of these, the Abip√≥n to the south of Bermejo were the first to advance towards central and southern Chaco. The Abipones were composed of three groups: the Riicag√© (people of the open countryside), the nacaigeterg√© (people of the forest) and the Yaaucanig√° (people of the river), each with their own dialect. The Payagu√° settled on the Paraguay River at north of the Bermejo river, and they were engaged in trade and piracy along the Paran√°-Paraguay river. The Spanish had traversed the entire perimeter of the Chaco between 1541 and 1580. In 1588, Corrientes was founded on the opposite bank of the Parana. =Foundation= Resistencia was founded on January 27, 1878, the date on which the initial measurement was approved (executed by Arturo Seelstrang) and officially created. The date of February 2 is celebrated as the arrival date of the first Friulian immigrants. However, historical studies agree that it was the same day of creation of the colony. The initial colonization process was the result of an official policy of settlement of this region based on Immigration Law No. 817, widespread in Europe during those years. The progress was partly due to the contribution of institutions such as the Italian Society, founded by the first Italians and which brought together a large part of the professional community, including medical partners, architects, lawyers, politicians, among others. =20th Century= In 1953 the National Territory of the Chaco was declared a province and Resistencia, which was already the capital of the National Territory, becomes the provincial capital. On July 3, 1939, Pope Pius XII split the diocese of Santa Fe to create the Diocese of Resistance, which was elevated to an archdiocese on April 1, 1984 by John Paul II. In the decade of the 1950s, during the governorship of Felipe Gallardo and Deolindo Felipe Bittel, the construction of the Resistencia International Airport was initiated. The public transport service Resistencia-Barranqueras was created, along with numerous buildings for schools, police stations, municipalities and health centers. Climate Resistencia is one of the warmest cities in Argentina, and is known for its extremely hot, humid summer weather with frequent lightning. The climate is humid subtropical (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa), with a cooler, dryer season and a long, humid summer. Fall and spring are often marked by sudden transitions from summer weather patterns to winter weather patterns. During the summer, temperatures attain highs of on a daily basis, and occasionally up to . The record temperature is on October 16, 2014. Nights are warm and sticky, between , and afternoon thunderstorms are common. The transition to fall is slow: March's temperatures are very similar to midsummer, and April is still warm with an average high of and a low of , and rainfall is very abundant: during that month. The dry, cool season starts in May and lasts until September. During its peak in June and July, the average high is and the average low is , with rainfall below in a month. These averages reflect the fact that there are two distinct weather patterns that alternate in the winter: the northerly, tropical pattern, and the southerly pattern of the Pampas: thus, there are periods of very warm, dry weather () with warm nights () followed by strong southerly winds, often accompanied with drizzle and temperatures that hover around for days at a time (creating a surprisingly cold feeling), followed by dry air and blue skies and cold nights () and pleasant, cool days between ). Light frost occurs under very calm conditions with cold air in place; usually measured temperatures will hover between but frost will cover the ground. On occasion, however, under very cold weather patterns, measured temperatures reach , with a record low of on June 29, 1996. Economy The city's economy, originally based on agriculture and trade, has diversified into the service sector in recent decades. Culture Resistencia is known nationally as the \\"city of sculptures\\" and \\"open-air museum\\" because of the more than 500 monuments and other works of art spread among its streets. 2 de Febrero park The city has organized a Biennial International Sculptures Contest since 1988; after each contest the sculptures remain in the city for public display in parks or sidewalks. Since 1997, the event has been sponsored by UNESCO. Resistencia is also home to a number of museums, including the Ren√© Bruseau Provincial Museum of Fine Arts, the Augusto Schulz Museum of Natural History, the Juan Alfredo Martinet Museum of Anthropology, the Ichoalay Cultural Museum, and the Ertivio Acosta Museum of Man in Chaco. Transport The city has been served by Resistencia International Airport since 1965; its terminal, completed in 1971, was designed by renowned modernist architect Amancio Williams. Its access via highways includes National Route 11 (north to south), National Route 16 (westbound), and the General Belgrano Bridge, which has connected Resistencia to its twin port city of Corrientes since 1973. Following the closure of rail lines in the area during the privatization of the nation's railways in the early 1990s, the city's rail links were re-established with the opening of the provincially funded Sefecha line in 1997.Ferrolatino: Sefecha Panoramic view of the airport as seen from the runway.

The first bridge over the Chubut in Rawson was built of wood in 1889 by the carpenter and Welsh-language poet Griffith Griffiths (1829‚Äì1909), who wrote under the bardic name ' and established the Patagonia Gorsedd of Bards. This bridge was destroyed by a flood ten years later, and was replaced by an iron bridge in 1917. In 2001 a decision was made to rename the iron bridge as ' (poet's bridge) in honor of Griffiths. A plaque was installed at the bridge with information on Griffiths.

Similar technologies have also been employed to design and manufacture analog, analog-digital, and structured arrays, but, in general, these are not called gate arrays. Gate arrays have also been known as Uncommitted Logic Arrays (ULAs) and semi-custom chips. Design A gate array is a prefabricated silicon chip with most transistors having no predetermined function. These transistors can be connected by metal layers to form standard NAND or NOR logic gates. These logic gates can then be further interconnected into a complete circuit on the same or later metal layers. Creation of a circuit with a specified function is accomplished by adding this final layer or layers of metal interconnects to the chip late in the manufacturing process, allowing the function of the chip to be customized as desired. These layers are analogous to the copper layers of a printed circuit board. The earliest gate arrays comprised bipolar transistors, usually configured as high performance transistor‚Äìtransistor logic, emitter-coupled logic or current-mode logic logic configurations. CMOS (complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor) gate arrays were later developed and came to dominate the industry. Gate array master slices with unfinished chips arrayed across a wafer are usually prefabricated and stockpiled in large quantities regardless of customer orders. The design and fabrication according to the individual customer specifications can be finished in a shorter time than standard cell or full custom design. The gate array approach reduces the non recurring engineering mask costs as fewer custom masks need to be produced. In addition, manufacturing test tooling lead time and costs are reduced - the same test fixtures can be used for all gate array products manufactured on the same die size. Gate arrays were the predecessor of the more complex structured ASIC; unlike gate arrays, structured ASICs tend to include predefined or configurable memories and/or analog blocks. An application circuit must be built on a gate array that has enough gates, wiring and I/O pins. Since requirements vary, gate arrays usually come in families, with larger members having more of all resources, but correspondingly more expensive. While the designer can fairly easily count how many gates and I/Os pins are needed, the amount of routing tracks needed may vary considerably even among designs with the same amount of logic. (For example, a crossbar switch requires much more routing than a systolic array with the same gate count.) Since unused routing tracks increase the cost (and decrease the performance) of the part without providing any benefit, gate array manufacturers try to provide just enough tracks so that most designs that will fit in terms of gates and I/O pins can be routed. This is determined by estimates such as those derived from Rent's rule or by experiments with existing designs. The main drawbacks of gate arrays are their somewhat lower density and performance compared with other approaches to ASIC design. However this style is often a viable approach for low production volumes. History Gate arrays had several concurrent development paths. Ferranti in the UK pioneered commercializing bipolar ULA technology, then later abandoned this lead in semi-custom chips. IBM developed proprietary bipolar master slices that it used in mainframe manufacturing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but never commercialized them externally. Fairchild Semiconductor also flirted briefly in the late 1960s with bipolar arrays diode‚Äìtransistor logic and transistor‚Äìtransistor logic called Micromosaic and Polycell. CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology opened the door to broad commercialization of gate arrays. The first CMOS gate arrays were developed by Robert Lipp in 1974 for International Microcircuits, Inc. (IMI) a Sunnyvale photo-mask shop started by Frank Deverse, Jim Tuttle and Charlie Allen, ex-IBM employees. This first product line employed 7.5 micron single-level metal CMOS technology and ranged from 50 to 400 gates. Computer-aided design (CAD) technology at the time was very rudimentary due to the low processing power available, so the design of these first products was only partially automated. This product pioneered several features that went on to become standard on future designs. The most important were: the strict organization of n-channel and p-channel transistors in 2-3 row pairs across the chip; and running all interconnect on grids rather than minimum custom spacing, which had been the standard till then. This later innovation paved the way to full automation when coupled with the development of 2-layer CMOS arrays. Customizing these first parts was somewhat tedious and error prone due to the lack of good software tools. IMI tapped into PC board development techniques to minimize manual customization effort. Chips at the time were designed by hand drawing all components and interconnect on precision gridded Mylar sheets, using colored pencils to delineate each processing layer. Rubylith sheets were then cut and peeled to create a (typically) 200x to 400x scale representation of the process layer. This was then photo-reduced to make a 1x mask. Digitization rather than rubylith cutting was just coming in as the latest technology, but initially it only removed the rubylith stage; drawings were still manual and then \\"hand\\" digitized. PC boards meanwhile had moved from custom rubylith to PC tape for interconnects. IMI created to-scale photo-enlargements of the base layers. Using decals of logic gate connections and PC tape to interconnect these gates, custom circuits could be quickly laid out by hand for these relatively small circuits, and photo-reduced using existing technologies. After a falling out with IMI, Robert Lipp went on to start California Devices, Inc. (CDI) in 1978 with two silent partners, Bernie Aronson and Brian Tighe. CDI quickly developed a product line competitive to IMI and shortly thereafter a 5 micron silicon gate single layer product line with densities up to 1,200 gates. A couple of years later CDI followed up with \\"channel-less\\" gate arrays that reduced the row blockages caused by a more complex silicon underlayer that pre-wired the individual transistor connections to locations needed for common logic functions, simplifying the first level metal interconnect. This increased chip densities 40%, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. Early gate arrays were low performance and relatively large and expensive compared to state-of-the-art n-MOS technology then being used for custom chips. CMOS technology was being driven by very low power applications such as watch chips and battery operated portable instrumentation, not performance. They were also well under the performance of the existing dominant logic technology, transistor‚Äìtransistor logic families. However, there were many niche applications where they were invaluable, particularly in low power, size reduction, portable and aerospace applications as well as time-to-market sensitive products. Even these small arrays could replace a board full of transistor‚Äìtransistor logic gates if performance were not an issue. A common application was combining a number of smaller circuits that were supporting a larger LSI circuit on a board was affectionately known as \\"garbage collection\\". And the low cost of development and custom tooling made the technology available to the most modest budgets. Early gate arrays played a large part in the CB craze in the 1970s as well as a vehicle for the introduction of other later mass-produced products such as modems and cell phones. Ferranti 2C210E on a Timex Sinclair 1000 motherboard By the early 1980s gate arrays were starting to move out of their niche applications to the general market. Several factors in technology and markets were converging. Size and performance were increasing; automation was maturing; technology became \\"hot\\" when in 1981 IBM introduced its new flagship 3081 mainframe with CPU comprising gate arrays,; they were used in a consumer product, the ZX81; and new entrants to the market increased visibility and credibility. In 1981, Wilfred Corrigan, Bill O'Meara Rob Walker and Mitchell \\"Mick\\" Bohn founded LSI Logic. Their initial intention was to commercialize emitter coupled logic gate arrays, but discovered the market was quickly moving towards CMOS. Instead they licensed CDI's silicon gate CMOS line as a second source. This product established them in the market while they developed their own proprietary 5 micron 2-layer metal line. This latter product line was the first commercial gate array product amenable to full automation. LSI developed a suite of proprietary development tools that allowed users to design their own chip from their own facility by remote login to LSI Logic's system. Sinclair Research ported an enhanced ZX80 design to a ULA chip for the ZX81, and later used a ULA in the ZX Spectrum. A compatible chip was made in Russia as T34VG1.–¢34–í–ì1 ‚Äî article about the ZX Spectrum ULA compatible chip Acorn Computers used several ULA chips in the BBC Micro, and later a single ULA for the Acorn Electron. Many other manufacturers from the time of the home computer boom period used ULAs in their machines. The IBM PC took over much of the personal computer market, and the sales volumes made full-custom chips more economical. Commodore's Amiga series used gate arrays for the Gary and Gayle custom-chips, as their code-names may suggest. While the market boomed, profits for the industry were lacking. Semiconductors underwent a series of rolling recessions during the 1980s that created a boom-bust cycle. The 1980 and 1981-1982 general recessions were followed by high interest rates that curbed capital spending. This reduction played havoc on the semiconductor business that at the time was highly dependent on capital spending. Manufacturers desperate to keep their fab plants full and afford constant modernization in a fast moving industry became hyper-competitive. The many new entrants to the market drove gate array prices down to the marginal costs of the silicon manufacturers. Fabless companies such as LSI Logic and CDI survived on selling design services and computer time rather than on the production revenues. Indirect competition arose with the development of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Xilinx was founded in 1984 and its first products were much like early gate arrays, slow and expensive, fit only for some niche markets. However, Moore's Law quickly made them a force and by the early 1990s were seriously disrupting the gate array market. Designers still wished for a way to create their own complex chips without the expense of full-custom design, and eventually this wish was granted with the arrival of not only the FPGA, but complex programmable logic device (CPLD), metal configurable standard cells (MCSC), and structured ASICs. Whereas a gate array required a back end semiconductor wafer foundry to deposit and etch the interconnections, the FPGA and CPLD had user programmable interconnections. Today's approach is to make the prototypes by FPGAs, as the risk is low and the functionality can be verified quickly. For smaller devices, production cost are sufficiently low. But for large FPGAs, production is very expensive, power hungry, and in many cases do not reach the required speed. To address these issues, several ASIC companies like BaySand, Faraday, Gigoptics and others offer FPGA to ASIC conversion services. Today, the gate array market is only a remnant of its former self, driven by the FPGA conversions done for cost or performance reasons. IMI moved out of gate arrays into mixed signal circuits and was later acquired by Cypress Semiconductor in 2001; CDI closed its doors in 1989; and LSI Logic abandoned the market in favor of standard products and was eventually acquired by Broadcom.

The tea infuser gained popularity in the first half of the 19th century. Tea infusers enable one to easily steep tea from fannings and broken leaf teas. Some infusers are removed along with the tea leaves from the pot, while so called shut-off infusers are left in the pot after the brewing process is complete. Use A tea infuser performs a similar function as a tea bag, a later American invention. The infuser is generally a small mesh or perforated metal container or covered spoon that holds tea leaves, in varying sizes to steep single or multiple servings at once. Common shapes for infusers include spherical, conical and cylindrical. One style of infuser is a split sphere with tong-like handles to open its mesh container. Two other types of spoon- shaped tea infusers, with handles The infuser is placed in a cup or pot of hot or boiling water, allowing the tea to brew without loose tea leaves spilling into the pot or cup. A rod or chain is commonly attached to the container of the infuser to simplify retrieval from the pot or cup. Infusers with large holes may not catch all the leaves, requiring the use of a tea strainer to remove the remaining pieces. French press While not common, a French press may be used as a tea infuser.

He was the brother of Hannibal and Mago Barca. Youth and Iberian leadership Carthaginian shekel, dated 237-227 BC, depicting the Punic god Melqart (equivalent to Hercules), most likely with the features of Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal Barca; on the reverse is a man riding a war elephant Little is known of Hasdrubal's early life. He was present, along with his brother Hannibal, when his father, Hamilcar, besieged the city of Helike. Hamilcar was forced to flee and drowned in the Jucar River. Little is known about his activities during the time Hasdrubal the Fair led the Punic forces in Spain, or during the campaigns of Hannibal Barca in Spain and his Siege of Saguntum. Hannibal, when he set out for Italy in 218 BC, left a force of 13,000 infantry, 2,550 cavalry and 21 war elephants in Iberia. The Punic navy had a fleet of 50 quinqueremes and 5 triremes stationed there. However, only 32 Quinqueremes were manned at the start of the Second Punic War. Hasdrubal commanded this force and was to set out for Italy in 217 BC to reinforce Hannibal. Hannibal left another army under Hanno in Catalonia, consisting of 10,000 foot and 1,000 horse on his way to Italy in 218 BC. Left in command of Hispania when Hannibal departed to Italy in 218 BC, Hasdrubal was destined to fight for six years against the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio. The expedition led by Gnaeus Scipio in 218 BC had caught the Carthaginians by surprise, and before Hasdrubal could join Hanno, the Carthaginian commander on the North of Ebro River, the Romans had fought and won the Battle of Cissa and established their army at Tarraco and their fleet at Emporiae. Hasdrubal, commanding only 8,000 troops and outnumbered by the Romans, raided the Romans with a flying column of light infantry and cavalry, which inflicted severe losses on their naval crews and reduced the fighting strength to 35 ships. This loss was offset by the arrival of an allied Greek contingent from the city of Massilia. In the spring of 217 BC, Hasdrubal led a joint expedition north to fight the Romans. He commanded the army, while his deputy commanded the fleet. The Punic Army and the fleet moved north side by side and encamped on the mouth of the Ebro River. Carelessness of the Carthaginian fleet enabled Gnaeus Scipio to surprise the Carthaginians and crush their naval contingent at the Battle of Ebro River. Hasdrubal retreated without fighting the Roman army. The year 216 was spent quelling an uprising of Iberian tribes, possibly the Turdetanians around the area near Gades. Hasdrubal was reinforced by 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry and was ordered by the Carthaginian senate to march to Italy in the same year. He left Himilco the Navigator in charge at Cartagena and marched for the Ebro river, but was heavily defeated in the Battle of Dertosa in the spring of 215 BC. This defeat prevented reinforcements reaching Hannibal from both Iberia and Africa at a critical moment of the War, when the Carthaginians held the upper hand in Italy. The Carthaginians from then on were forced to contest the Romans in the area between the Ebro and Jucar rivers. Joint command This defeat also led to Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco arriving in Iberia with two armies and ending the undisputed command of the Barcid family in Iberia. The Carthaginians fought the Scipio brothers and had on the whole the worst of the conflict between 215 and 212 BC, but managed to prevent the loss of any territory. At the instigation of the Romans, Syphax, one of the kings of the Numidian tribes, attacked Carthaginian territories in Africa in 213/212 BC. The situation in Iberia was sufficiently under control, because Hasdrubal and his Iberian army crossed over to Africa and crushed the threat of Syphax in a battle where 30,000 Numidians were killed. With his Roman-trained army shattered, Syphax fled to Mauritania. The aid of Masinissa, a Numidian prince, was invaluable during this episode, and he crossed over to Iberia with Hasdrubal after the African expedition ended with 3,000 Numidian cavalry. In late 212 BC, Hasdrubal, with timely cooperation from Mago Barca and Hasdrubal Gisco, completely routed his opponents at the Battle of the Upper Baetis, destroying the majority of the Roman army in Iberia and killing both the Scipios. Carthaginians gained control of Iberia up to the Ebro as a result of this victory. However, the lack of cooperation between the Carthaginian generals led to the surviving Roman force of 8,000 retiring safely to the north of the river Ebro. These troops somehow managed to keep the Carthaginian armies from gaining a foothold north of the Ebro. The Romans reinforced this detachment with 10,000 troops under Claudius Nero in 211 BC and with another 10,000 soldiers under Scipio Africanus Major in 210 BC, who spent the year training his army and improving his diplomatic contacts. The Carthaginian armies had dispersed into the interior of Iberia in 209 BC, possibly to maintain control over the Iberian tribes, which they were dependent on for soldiers and provisions. The Carthaginian armies were subsequently outgeneraled by Scipio Africanus Major, who, taking advantage of the absence of the three Carthaginian armies in 209 BC, captured Carthago Nova and gained other advantages. Hasdrubal was defeated by Scipio at the Battle of Baecula but managed to retreat with two-thirds of his army intact. Second Carthaginian expedition to Italy Later in 209 BC, Hasdrubal was summoned to join his brother in Italy. He eluded Scipio by crossing the Pyrenees at their western extremity and safely made his way into Gaul in the winter of 208. Hasdrubal had waited until the spring of 207 to make his way through the Alps and into Northern Italy. Hasdrubal made much faster progress than his brother had, partly due to the construction left behind by Hannibal's army when he had passed via the same route a decade earlier, but also due to the removal of the Gallic threat that had plagued Hannibal early on. The Gauls now feared and respected the Carthaginians, and not only was Hasdrubal allowed to pass through the Alps unmolested, his ranks were bolstered by many enthusiastic Gauls. Hasdrubal, in the same fashion as his brother, succeeded in bringing his war elephants, raised and trained in Hispania. It was not until Hasdrubal sent messengers to Hannibal that decisive measures were taken. Hasdrubal wished to meet with his brother in South Umbria. However, this was not to be. Hasdrubal's messengers were captured, and he was ultimately checked by two Roman armies. Being forced to give battle, he was decisively defeated at the Battle of the Metaurus. Hasdrubal, with his armies defeated and in full disorganized retreat, charged into the fray to his certain death, and was beheaded. His head was packed into a sack and thrown into his brother Hannibal's camp as a sign of his utter defeat. This action was in stark contrast to Hannibal's treatment of the bodies of fallen Roman Consuls.

Seafair is a summer festival in Seattle, Washington, that encompasses a wide variety of small neighborhood events leading up to several major citywide celebrations. While many small block parties and local parades occur under the auspices of Seafair, most Seattle residents associate Seafair with the Torchlight Parade (and accompanying Torchlight Run), Seafair Cup hydroplane races, and the Blue Angels. Seafair has been an annual event in Seattle since 1950History of Seafair - 1950's but its roots can be traced to the 1911 Seattle Golden Potlatch Celebrations. History The 2020 schedule for Sefair was cancelled on May 20, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on public gatherings. Events Seafair begins in mid-June; since 1949, its arrival has been heralded by the Seafair Pirates Landing on Alki Beach, and the Milk Carton Derby on Green Lake, a whimsical boat race in which all the boats have been constructed out of empty milk cartons.History of Seafair - 1970's Entries always range from those carefully shaped for speed and stability to those designed for maximum amusement. The Derby is usually associated with a variety of activities for children and families on the shores of Green Lake. The Seafair Half Marathon was added in 2002, follow three years later by the full Seafair Marathon. Participants can run or walk the and courses. If a shorter distance is more appealing, participants can run or walk a 5 km course. The 2008 Seafair Half Marathon and Seafair Marathon began at Husky Stadium, crossed the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, and ended at Bellevue, Washington's Bellevue Downtown Park. After the race, live music was performed. In 2009, the Seafair Marathon and Half Marathon were replaced with the Rock 'n' Roll Seattle Marathon and Half Marathon.The Seattle Times: Rock 'n' roll run set to replace Seafair Marathon, by Jayda Evans, August 6, 2008 In 2013, an Independence Day fireworks show at Lake Union known as the Seafair Summer Fourth was added. The event serves as a successor to the Family Fourth event that was also held at Lake Union, but was cancelled by its organizers due to a lack of funding. The event was revived under the auspices of Seafair with the financial support of local sponsors. The Seafair Triathlon is held on the shores of Lake Washington from Seward Park. It features both Sprint - half-mile swim, bike ride, and 5 km run - and Olympic distances. Participants can compete individually or as a team. Typically, the Seafair Triathlon is held the third weekend of July. In 2007, the Seafair Triathlon saw a record turnout of 2,200.participants Seafair Triathlon =The Torchlight festivities= The last weekend in July belongs to the Torchlight Parade and Torchlight Run. Many local organizations participate in these events, held on the streets of downtown Seattle. The local woman who has been selected as \\"Miss Seafair\\" (prior to 1972, \\"Seafair Queen\\") plays a prominent role in the parade. It is traditionally preceded by the Torchlight Run, a short (8 km) race through the city's streets in which many participants run in costume. =The Seafair Weekend= One of the most popular events of the festival is the Seafair Weekend, held traditionally the first weekend of August on Genesee Park. Seafair Weekend main events include hydroplane racing on the water and aerobatics show in the sky. The Seafair Cup is an American Boat Racing Association unlimited hydroplane racing circuit stop at Stan Sayres Memorial Park on Lake Washington, in the Mount Baker neighborhood. The races attract tens of thousands of spectators, both those standing on the public shores of the lake, and those in boats anchored just outside the course in the lake itself. A tradition started in 1972, the Seafair Air Show is an aerobatics show coincidently with the days of the Seafair Cup. World-class aerobatics teams perform their aerial stunts over Lake Washington, most prominently the US Navy Blue Angels and US Army Golden Knights. Notoriously, the Blue Angels have been attending the Air Show annually since its first edition, excepting in three occasions. The aerobatics show is a slightly controversial part of Seafair, as some local residents fear an accident involving the low-flying aircraft, and some find the noise of the jet engines irritating.Capitol Hill Seattle blog - No More Blue Angels Over Homes Please There was no show at Seafair in 1994 and 1995 as a result of a dispute with the FAA about whether they could safely fly over Lake Washington. In 1996 the Blue Angels flew over Elliott Bay, west of downtown Seattle, in a separate event from the hydroplane race, but this was a financial flop, and they returned to being part of the race-weekend festivities over Lake Washington in 1997.History of Seafair - 1990's Due to government budget cuts, the Blue Angels did not perform at Seafair 2013; they were replaced by the Patriots Jet Team. From 2019, the aerobatics show fly-over area was moved south to avoid the closing of the floating bridges carrying Interstate 90 between Mercer Island and Seattle during the three days of Seafair Weekend.https://patch.com/washington/seattle/seafair-weekend-2019-what-you- need-know Groups =The Seafair Pirates= Seafair Pirates Moby Duck at the Torchlight Parade with Seattle's landmark Space Needle in the background (2013) Another aspect of Seafair is the involvement of the Seafair Pirates, an organization that works year-round entertaining children in hospitals and performing other acts of community service including extensive fundraising. However, the pirates also usually perform loud‚Äîoccasionally offensive‚Äîantics at Seafair (in an attempt to live up to their name) that cause perennial objection to their prominent involvement in the festivities.

The United States launched flights containing primate passengers primarily between 1948 and 1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. France launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967. The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996. Most primates were anesthetized before lift-off. Overall, thirty-two non-human primates flew in the space program; none flew more than once. Numerous backup primates also went through the programs but never flew.

Alberts, I, II, and IV were rhesus macaque while Albert III was a crab-eating macaque. Monkeys later flew on Aerobee rockets. On April 18, 1951, a monkey, possibly called Albert V, died due to parachute failure. Yorick, also called Albert VI, along with 11 mouse crewmates, reached 236,000 ft (72 km, 44.7 mi) and survived the landing, on September 20, 1951, the first monkey to do so (the dogs Dezik, and Tsygan had survived a trip to space in July of that year), although he died 2 hours later. Two of the mice also died after recovery; all of the deaths were thought to be related to stress from overheating in the sealed capsule in the New Mexico sun while awaiting the recovery team. Albert VI's flight surpassed the 50-mile boundary the U.S. used for spaceflight but was below the international definition of space. Patricia and Mike, two cynomolgus monkeys, flew on May 21, 1952, and survived, but their flight was only to 26 kilometers. On December 13, 1958, Gordo, also called Old Reliable, a squirrel monkey, survived being launched aboard Jupiter AM-13 by the US Army. He was killed due to mechanical failure of the parachute recovery system in the rocket nose cone. Able on display at the National Air and Space MuseumOn May 28, 1959, aboard the JUPITER AM-18, Able, a rhesus macaque, and Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey flew a successful mission. Able was born at the Ralph Mitchell Zoo in Independence, Kansas. They travelled in excess of 16,000 km/h, and withstood 38 g (373 m/s2). Able died June 1, 1959, while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode, from a reaction to the anesthesia. Baker became the first monkey to survive the stresses of spaceflight and the related medical procedures. Baker died November 29, 1984, at the age of 27 and is buried on the grounds of the United States Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Able was preserved, and is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. Their names were taken from the 1943‚Äì1955 US military phonetic alphabet.\\"Kansan among first to go to space\\" , Wichita Eagle and Kansas.com, March 22, 2010. On December 4, 1959, from Wallops Island, Virginia, Sam, a rhesus macaque, flew on the Little Joe 2 in the Mercury program to 53 miles high. On January 21, 1960, Miss Sam, also a rhesus macaque, followed, on Little Joe 1B although her flight was only to in a test of emergency procedures. Ham and Enos also flew in the Mercury program but they were chimpanzees. The names 'Sam' and 'Ham' were acronyms. Sam was named in homage to the School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The name 'Ham' was taken from Holloman Aerospace Medicine at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Goliath, a squirrel monkey, died in the explosion of his Atlas rocket on November 10, 1961. A rhesus macaque called Scatback flew a sub-orbital flight on December 20, 1961, but was lost at sea after landing. Bonny, a pig-tailed macaque, flew on Biosatellite 3, a mission which lasted from June 29 to July 8, 1969. This was the first multi-day monkey flight but came after longer human spaceflights were common. He died within a day of landing. Spacelab 3 on the Space Shuttle flight STS-51-B featured two squirrel monkeys named No. 3165 and No. 384-80. The flight was from April 29 to May 6, 1985.PROGRAMS, MISSIONS, AND PAYLOADS STS-51B/Spacelab 3 , NASA France France launched a pig-tailed macaque named Martine on a Vesta rocket on March 7, 1967, and another named Pierette on March 13. These suborbital flights reached and , respectively. Martine became the first monkey to survive more than a couple of hours after flying above the international definition of the edge of space. (Ham and Enos, launched earlier by the United States, had been chimpanzees).Burgess & Dubbs (2007), p. 387. Soviet Union and Russia The Soviet /Russian space program used only rhesus macaques in its Bion satellite program in 1980s and 1990s. The names of the monkeys began with sequential letters of the Russian alphabet (–ê, –ë, –í, –ì, –î, –ï, –Å, –ñ, –ó...). The animals all survived their missions but for a single fatality in post-flight surgery, after which the program was cancelled. #The first monkeys launched by Soviet space program, Abrek and Bion, flew on Bion 6. They remained aloft from December 14, 1983 ‚Äì December 20, 1983. #Next came Bion 7 with monkeys Verny and Gordy from July 10, 1985 ‚Äì July 17, 1985. #Then Dryoma and Yerosha on Bion 8 from September 29, 1987 ‚Äì October 12, 1987. After returning from space Dryoma was presented to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. #Bion 9 with monkeys Zhakonya and Zabiyaka followed from September 15, 1989 to September 28, 1989. The two took the space endurance record for monkeys at 13 days, 17 hours in space. #Monkeys Krosh and Ivasha flew on Bion 10 from December 29, 1992 to January 7, 1993. Krosh produced offspring, after rehabilitation upon returning to Earth. #Lapik and Multik were the last monkeys in space until Iran launched one of its own in 2013. The pair flew aboard Bion 11 from December 24, 1996, to January 7, 1997. Upon return, Multik died while under anesthesia for US biopsy sampling on January 8. Lapik nearly died while undergoing the identical procedure. No follow-up research has been conducted to determine whether these two incidents, together with the 1959 loss of the US monkey Able in post-flight surgery, contraindicate the administration of anesthesia during or shortly after spaceflights. Further US support of the Bion program was cancelled. Argentina On December 23, 1969, as part of the 'Operaci√≥n Navidad' (Operation Christmas), Argentina launched Juan (a tufted capuchin, native to Argentina's Misiones Province) using a two-stage Rigel 04 rocket. It ascended perhaps up to 82 kilometers and then was recovered successfully.

All of these are below the international definition of space (100 km). Later, on February 1, 1970, the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using a X-1 Panther rocket. Although it reached a higher altitude than its predecessor, it was lost after the capsule's parachute failed. China The PRC spacecraft Shenzhou 2 launched on January 9, 2001. It is rumoured that inside the reentry module (precise information is lacking due to the secrecy surrounding China's space program) a monkey, dog, and rabbit rode aloft in a test of the spacecraft's life support systems. The SZ2 reentry module landed in Inner Mongolia on January 16. No images of the recovered capsule appeared in the press, leading to the widespread inference that the flight ended in failure. According to press reports citing an unnamed source, a parachute connection malfunction caused a hard landing.

Pre-flight and post-flight photos clearly showed different monkeys. The confusion was due to the publishing of an archive photo from 2011 by the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA). According to Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer, \\"They just mixed that footage with the footage of the 2013 successful launch.\\" On December 14, 2013, AFP and BBC reported that Iran again sent a monkey to space and safely returned it. Rhesus macaque Aftab (2013.01.28) and Fargam (2013.12.14) were each launched separately into space and safely returned. Researchers continue to study the effects of the space trip on their offspring.

A leading Broadway composer of his day, Youmans collaborated with virtually all the greatest lyricists on Broadway: Ira Gershwin, Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein II, Irving Caesar, Anne Caldwell, Leo Robin, Howard Dietz, Clifford Grey, Billy Rose, Edward Eliscu, Edward Heyman, Harold Adamson, Buddy DeSylva and Gus Kahn. Youmans' early songs are remarkable for their economy of melodic material: two-, three- or four-note phrases are constantly repeated and varied by subtle harmonic or rhythmic changes. In later years, however, apparently influenced by Jerome Kern, he turned to longer musical sentences and more free-flowing melodic lines. Youmans published fewer than 100 songs, but 18 of these were considered standards by ASCAP, a remarkably high percentage. Biography Youmans was born in New York City into a prosperous family of hat makers. When he was two, his father moved the family to upper-class Larchmont, New York.Suskin, Steven. \\"Vincent Youmans\\". Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers. Oxford University Press: 2000. Youmans attended the Trinity School in Mamaroneck, New York, and Heathcote Hall in Rye, New York. His ambition was initially to become an engineer, and he attended Yale University for a short time. He dropped out to become a runner for a Wall Street brokerage firm, but was soon drafted in the Navy during World War I, although he saw no combat. While stationed in Illinois, he took an interest in the theatre and began producing troop shows for the Navy. After the war, Youmans was a Tin Pan Alley song-plugger for Jerome H. Remick Music Publishers, and then a rehearsal pianist for composer Victor Herbert‚Äôs operettas. at the Songwriters' Hall of Fame, accessed April 22, 2018 In 1921 he collaborated with lyricist Ira Gershwin on the score for Two Little Girls in Blue, which brought him his first Broadway composing credit, and his first hit song \\"Oh Me! Oh My!\\", and a contract with TB Harms Company. His next show was Wildflower (1923), with lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II, which was a major success. His most enduring success was No, No, Nanette, with lyrics by Irving Caesar, which reached Broadway in 1925 after an unprecedented try-out in Chicago and subsequent national and international tours. No, No Nanette was the biggest musical-comedy success of the 1920s in both Europe and the USA and his two songs \\"Tea for Two\\" and \\"I Want to Be Happy\\" were worldwide hits. Both songs are considered standards. \\"Tea For Two\\" was consistently ranked among the most recorded popular songs for decades. In 1927, Youmans began producing his own Broadway shows. He also left his publisher TB Harms Company and began publishing his own songs. He had a major success with Hit the Deck! (1927), which included the hit songs \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\". His subsequent productions after 1927 were failures, despite the song hits they featured (\\"Great Day and \\"Without a Song\\" from Great Day (1929), \\"Time On My Hands\\" from Smiles (1930), and the title song from Through the Years). His last contributions to Broadway were additional songs for Take a Chance (1932).Bordman, Gerald. \\"Vincent Youmans\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy, accessed 12 July 2008 In 1933, Youmans wrote the songs for Flying Down to Rio, the first film to feature Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers as a featured dancing pair. His score contained \\"Orchids in the Moonlight\\", \\"The Carioca\\", \\"Music Makes Me\\", and the title song. The film was a tremendous hit, and it revived the composer's professional prospects, though he never again wrote for Astaire/Rogers. After a professional career of only 13 years, Youmans was forced into retirement in 1934 after contracting tuberculosis. He spent the remainder of his life battling the disease. His only return to Broadway was to mount an ill-fated extravaganza entitled Vincent Youmans' Ballet Revue (1943), an ambitious mix of Latin-American and classical music, including Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√©. Choreographed by Leonide Massine. The production lost some $4 million.Vincent Youmans, in The Faber Companion to 20th Century Popular Music (2001). Retrieved April 13, 2008 He died of tuberculosis at age 47, in Denver, Colorado. At the time of his death, Youmans left behind a large quantity of unpublished material. In 1970, Youmans was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1971, No, No Nanette enjoyed a notable Broadway revival starring Ruby Keeler, and choreographed by legendary Hollywood choreographer Busby Berkeley, which was widely credited with beginning the nostalgia era on Broadway. In 1983, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

The city has 80,632 inhabitants (2020) , and is located on the southern margin of the Negro River, about 30 kilometres off the Atlantic Coast, and 960 km from the city of Buenos Aires on the National Route 3.  History  R√≠o Negro linking the twin cities. Together with the city of Carmen de Patagones across the river in Buenos Aires Province, Viedma is the oldest European settlement in Patagonia, founded by Francisco de Viedma y Narv√°ez under the name of Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen on 22 April 1779. Originally the two cities were one, called Carmen de Patagones. The original fort was built on the south side of the river in modern Viedma, but it was destroyed within a few months. A new fort was built on the north side, in modern Carmen de Patagones. This fort lasted much longer, and the tower still stands today. The town grew and eventually expanded back across the river into modern-day Viedma. On 11 October 1878, the town was split, with the R√≠o Negro as their border. With the Conquest of the Desert, the city became the capital of all Argentine Patagonia and later, when that was further divided into smaller territories, the capital of the R√≠o Negro Territory. In 1880, Alvaro Barros, the first governor of R√≠o Negro, changed the name of the city to Viedma. During severe flooding in 1889, the capital of R√≠o Negro was temporary moved to Choele Choel, but was quickly restored to Viedma. In 1986, during the presidency of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, a proposal was made to move the federal capital from Buenos Aires to Viedma.An ambitious project that goes back to the ‚Äò80s, Buenos Aires Herald, January 9, 2014 This was to reduce congestion in Buenos Aires, to help develop Patagonia, and to promote the development of the interior.Capital Cities/Les Capitales: International Perspectives/Perspectives Internationales, John H. Taylor, Jean G. Lengell√©, Caroline Andrew, McGill- Queen's Press, MQUP, 1993, page 150 A bill to that effect was passed by Congress the following year, but owing to economic problems, the project had stagnated by the end of the Alfons√≠n administration in 1989.The Strait of Magellan, Michael A. Morris, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 33  Economy  The main economical activities in the area of the Valle Inferior are cattle, as well as some agriculture with onion, maize and alfalfa being the most important. However, Viedma is mainly an administrative city, being the capital city of the province.  Transport  The Gobernador Castello Airport serves flights to Buenos Aires, Neuqu√©n, Bariloche, Puerto Madryn, Trelew, Comodoro Rivadavia, Mar del Plata, and other cities in Argentina. It is located 6 km from the city, and has an average annual traffic of 30,000 passengers. 30 km downstream from Viedma, on the Atlantic shore, the El C√≥ndor beach resort town (Balneario Massini) is the most visited tourist beach in the area. The Servicios Ferroviarios Patag√≥nico connect with San Carlos de Bariloche.  Climate  Viedma has a cool semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk). The nearby South Atlantic Ocean and the Viedma river moderate the climate. The city is windy throughout the entire year. Average windspeeds ranging from a low of to in December. Generally, the windiest period is from October to February while March to June are the least windy. The cause of this is attributed to the effects produced by the convergence of distinct wind currents originating from the general atmospheric circulation from both the South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High. Being located in a transitional area between the South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High, this geographic location is responsible for the variability in wind speeds throughout the year. Occasionally, strong gusts exceeding can occur. Winters are cool with a July mean of and frosts are common, averaging 9‚Äì10 days from June to August. During this time of the year, overcast days are more common, averaging 9‚Äì10 days per month although sunny days are fairly common as well. Spring and fall are transition seasons featuring warm daytime temperatures and cool nighttime temperatures and are highly variable with some days reaching above and below . Summers are hot and dry with a January high of and a low of . The diurnal range (difference between average high and average low) is large along with the temperature profile of Viedma makes it appropriate for the development of wide variety of subtropical crops. Humid days are rare owing to the low humidity (around 50%) and a dewpoint temperature of . During the hottest days in summer when the wind is from the northwest or west, sea breezes can occur that can move inland in the opposite of the mentioned wind directions which moderate summer temperatures. This occurs because when the surrounding land heats faster than the sea, causing the land to have lower atmospheric pressure than the sea which has a relatively higher atmospheric pressure. As a result, the pressure difference causes the sea breeze to move inland to the lower pressure area. In contrast, during night, the reverse occurs as the land cools faster than the surrounding sea. Frosts that occur in winter are usually of short duration and are not intense. The average date of the first frost occurs on April 8 and the last frost occurs on November 21 and there are 210 frost free days in an average year. Relative humidity is low, averaging 62%, with the summer months being drier than the winter months. Nonetheless, it is common to have high humidity conditions, particularly during early morning and late evening when temperatures are lower. On average, Viedma receives of precipitation per year which is evenly distributed throughout the year. During spring and summer, precipitation occurs irregularly and there is a water deficit, owing to higher temperatures and windier conditions that promote evapotranspiration and drier conditions. In winter and autumn, precipitation occurs regularly resulting in less water deficit owing to lower temperatures, more moderate winds, and higher humidity (lower evapotranspiration). On average, there are 73 days with measurable precipitation. Summers tend to have less rainy days than winter due to rainfall occurring more intensely (shorter bursts). Viedma receives 2620 hours of sunshine per year or 57.7% of possible sunshine per year, ranging from a low of 43.5% in July to a high of 69% in March.

It occupies a strip of land west of the confluence of the Limay and Neuqu√©n rivers which form the R√≠o Negro making it part of the ecoregion of Alto Valle del R√≠o Negro. The city and surrounding area have a population of more than 340,000, making it the largest city in Patagonia. Along with the cities of Plottier and Cipolletti, it is part of the Neuqu√©n ‚Äì Plottier ‚Äì Cipolletti conurbation. Founded in 1904, it is the newest provincial capital city in Argentina. Economy Neuqu√©n is both an important agricultural center, surrounded by fertile lands irrigated by the waters of the Limay and Neuqu√©n rivers in an otherwise arid province, and a petrochemical industrial center that receives oil extracted from different points of the province. It belongs economically and geographically to the Alto Valle region that produces apples, pears, and other fruits. With the discovery of the Vaca Muerta oil fields west of the city (3rd largest shale gas & oil reserves in the world), it has begun to experience a boom in real estate and construction. It is expected that over the next few years the city will experience unprecedented growth as it is the only significant city in the region (it has an airport, shopping centers, office space and institutions to become the center of the operations not only of the oil & gas companies, but also their suppliers) Transport National Route 22 divides the city into two-halves. The Presidente Per√≥n Airport is eight kilometers () away from the city and serves regular flights to Buenos Aires, San Carlos de Bariloche, Comodoro Rivadavia, R√≠o Gallegos, R√≠o Grande, Ushuaia, and San Mart√≠n de los Andes. The Tren del Valle commuter rail service links Neuqu√©n with neighbouring Cipolletti. History The first inhabitants of the area were very mobile and moved according to the seasons of the year, climatic conditions, and the abundance of food and game. Around the 16th century the people living in different areas of the province began to be assimilated by the Mapuche people.Historia del Neuqu√©n, Pangera Editora, 2001, page 27. One of the most important trails used by the Mapuches passed through the area of the confluence of the Limay and Neuqu√©n rivers. In the 17th century European explorers arrived in the area of the confluence. In 1604, Hernando Arias de Saavedra decided to explore the trails to Patagonia. With the support of the ranchers of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Corrientes, he departed from Buenos Aires and passed through the mountains of the Sierra de la Ventana. He reached what is now the city of Neuqu√©n and continued on, possibly passing through what is today Auca Mahuida. In 1782, departing from Carmen de Patagones, Basilio Villarino traveled upstream on the R√≠o Negro. On 23 January 1783, he arrived at the confluence of the Limay and Neuqu√©n Rivers, camping on an island.Neuqu√©n: Historia y leyendas, InterPatagonia. He then followed the Limay to the confluence of the Coll√≥n Cur√°, then from there to the Chimehuin River.Naves y navegantes por Choele Choel, Rio Negro Online, H. P√©rez Morando. =Neuqu√©n as part of Argentina= In 1885, the lands of what was at that time called Confluencia (i.e., \\"confluence,\\" referring to the two rivers) were auctioned to a few people. Shortly after the Conquest of the Desert campaign conducted by the military over Patagonia, the Tehuelche and Pehuenche tribes that inhabited the province of Neuqu√©n were either killed or pushed out of these lands. Since there was no defined border with Chile, the Argentine government reached an agreement with the British-owned Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway company that was constructing a railway network, mainly in Buenos Aires Province, to build an extension to the town in exchange for lands, in order to populate it. In 1899, the railroad reached Cipolletti in R√≠o Negro province, and three years later, after the construction of the bridge, arrived at Neuqu√©n. Neuqu√©n was officially founded on 12 September 1904, and the capital of the territory was transferred from Chos Malal to the young town. The name \\"Neuqu√©n\\" derives from the Mapudungun word nehuenken, meaning drafty, which the native people used in reference to this river. By 1930, the town had only 5,000 inhabitants. In the 1960s, it acquired a new importance when oil deposits were found in the province by the state company YPF. The 1970s and 1980s saw massive demographic growth, accompanied by improvements such as the creation of the National University of Comahue in 1971. Climate Neuqu√©n has an arid climate (K√∂ppen BWk). Precipitation is low, averaging per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual temperature is between . During December and January, the mean temperature in these months is about while in July, it reaches below . Being located far away from any major bodies of water, the thermal amplitude is high along with a large diurnal range, which indicates continental characteristics of the climate of the city. Winds are moderately strong throughout the year, which favors evapotranspiration. Most of the wind comes from the west and the southwest, both of which occur 40‚Äì50% of the time. Summers tend to be windier than winters with average wind speeds ranging from a low of in July to a high of in December. Mean daily sunshine hours range from a high of 11 hours/day in January to a low of 3 hours/day in June. The highest temperature recorded was on 21 January 1980 while the lowest temperature recorded was on 13 June 1961.

It held radio, television broadcasting and publishing assets in several countries, primarily in Canada. Canwest entered bankruptcy protection in late 2009, leading to the sale of the company's assets. Canwest's newspaper arm was sold to a group of creditors led by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey, through a newly formed company named Postmedia Network. The sale of the company's broadcasting arm to Shaw Communications closed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22; those assets were then collectively known as Shaw Media. On April 1, 2016, the broadcasting assets were subsumed into Corus Entertainment, an existing broadcasting firm also owned by the Shaw family. Following the sale of assets, the company was renamed 2737469 Canada Inc., ceased to carry on business, and commenced bankruptcy proceedings under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act before finally being dissolved on May 27, 2013.\\"Canwest‚Äôs restructuring Plan successfully implemented \\", 2737469 Canada Inc. press release (via Shaw Media), 2010-10-27. Retrieved 2010-10-27. Operations As of April 2009 (prior to seeking creditor protection), Canwest owned, in whole or part, a variety of Canadian media assets, including: * Global Television Network, a primary Canadian television network which reaches over 94% of the English-speaking population of Canada; * E!, a now-defunct secondary Canadian television system consisted of five smaller- market stations; however, through repeaters and cable television, it reaches the majority of major Canadian markets. The \\"E!\\" name was licensed by the American channel of the same name, which also supplies the majority of its programming outside of local news and regional programming and primetime shows from the American broadcast networks; * Specialty services including Showcase, Slice, HGTV Canada, DTour, and various digital services; * Southam Inc. and its former properties, which included the number-two national newspaper National Post, the broadsheet daily newspapers in most major markets, several other smaller newspapers, and the Canwest News Service newswire. Canwest was Canada's largest newspaper publisher; * Production, distribution, and Internet assets associated with all the Canwest properties The company had previously sold off some of the smaller newspapers it had acquired in the Southam purchase. Canwest also previously owned broadcasting operations in Australia (as majority shareholder of Network Ten), New Zealand (through CanWest MediaWorks New Zealand), and the Republic of Ireland (as a minority shareholder of TV3). History =Beginnings= In 1974, a group led by Israel Asper bought the assets of Pembina, North Dakota television station KCND-TV from broadcaster Gordon McLendon, moving the station to Winnipeg as independent station CKND-TV. Asper, through his company, Canwest, eventually bought out his partners in the Winnipeg station. A few months later, the Asper group joined a consortium that bought CIII-DT, a network of six simulcasting transmitters across Ontario that carried many of CKND's programs and was known on-air as the Global Television Network. Canwest bought controlling interest in 1985, thus becoming the first western-based owner of a major Canadian broadcaster. Canwest subsequently invested in or acquired other independent TV stations across Canada. Eventually, his station group became known as the \\"Canwest Global System.\\" In 1997, Canwest bought controlling interest in CKMI- TV, the privately owned CBC affiliate in Quebec City. Canwest then set up CKMI rebroadcasters in Montreal and Sherbrooke. With this move, Canwest's stations now had enough coverage of Canada that on August 18‚Äîthe day CKMI officially disaffiliated from CBC‚ÄîCanwest rebranded its station group as \\"The Global Television Network.\\" Throughout the 1990s, Global (and its antecedents) held Canadian rights to hit U.S. series such as Cheers, Friends, and Frasier. Canwest also bought broadcasting assets internationally, including outlets in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Australia, although all were eventually sold off. In 1991, Canwest issued a successful initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In June 1996, Canwest was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\\"CanWest Global Communications Corp. \\", New York Stock Exchange =Beyond broadcasting and the newspapers= Lacking a presence in Alberta, the company set its sights on Western International Communications, which owned three independent stations in that province that carried Global programming. It eventually bought that company's broadcasting assets in 2000. This not only boosted Global's coverage in western Canada, but prompted the establishment of a second over-the-air service, originally known as CH, since in some areas the combined company had duplicate over-the-air coverage through multiple stations. Later that year, Canwest announced its acquisition of the Southam newspaper chain from Conrad Black, in order to pursue a media convergence strategy. The CanWest logo from 1997 to 2008. Canwest was initially slow to invest in specialty channels due to the strength of its terrestrial network. In 1999, seeking to change this, the company announced a deal to buy out the Canadian partners of NetStar Communications, owner of TSN, but was stymied by U.S. partner ESPN, which had veto power over such a sale. ESPN instead came to terms with Canwest's main rival CTV, a longtime business partner of ESPN's parent company Disney, as an acceptable buyer,\\"CTV AND ESPN AGREE TO BUY CONTROL OF NETSTAR\\", The New York Times, February 6, 1999 which the selling partners eventually agreed to. In October 2005, CanWest's Canadian newspapers were sold into an IPO trust. Sold 25.8% of Canada's newspapers for C$550 million. Attached to the Canadian newspaper IPO was $850 million in long term debt. CanWest bought back the 25.8% Newspaper Trust IPO (and debt) in November 2008, for cash considerations of $495 million. The company was already one of the largest owners of Canadian local TV stations, when Canwest and Goldman Sachs in 2007 announced they would jointly acquire Canadian producer and broadcaster Alliance Atlantis Communications and its large stable of wide-distribution specialty channels. Under the deal, Canwest took control of the broadcasting portion of AAC, although Goldman Sachs remained a major investor in those assets. Goldman retained or resold the remaining pieces of AAC, the distribution arm soon re- emerging as Alliance Films. Canwest executives testified in the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission hearings over fee-for- carriage, requesting that the commission force cable and satellite companies to pay for their signals without passing the fees on to their subscribers. In his testimony, Canwest president Leonard Asper blamed the current rules for the poor financial condition of Canada's broadcast television stations, a position which has subsequently been adopted and addressed through rule changes by the CRTC and FCC. =Restructuring and creditor protection= Canwest's various acquisitions took a significant financial toll. As early as 2002, most of Canwest's operating income was going to pay interest on its high-interest rate debt. By 2007, the company's bonds were downgraded to junk status. By early 2009, it became clear the company's debt was not manageable in light of the global economic crisis, forcing Canwest into an extended set of negotiations with its lenders and a series of cost-cutting moves. The company's income statements reported net losses in 2008 and 2009, even though its operating activities were profitable (before taxes, interest, and non- operating charges: C$197 million in 2009, vs. C$428 million in 2008). On August 31, 2009, Canwest shut down its secondary system E! (the former CH). Three of the former E! owned-and-operated stations - CHCH Hamilton, CHEK Victoria, and CJNT Montreal - were sold to third parties, while a fourth, CHBC Kelowna, was converted to a Global station. The remaining station, CHCA Red Deer, was closed as of the same date.\\"CHCA-TV fades to black\\" . Red Deer Advocate, Albertalocalnews.com (July 23, 2009). On September 24, the company announced that it would sell its 50.1% stake in Ten Network Holdings for A$680 million, in order to pay down its significant debt. The sale of CanWest's Australian media operations reduced some C$582-million in debt tied to the Australian TV network, raising the total value Canwest can erase from its overall debt to more than C$1.2-billion. Before the Ten deal, Canwest held about C$3.8-billion of debt on its balance sheet. In court documents, Goldman Sachs alleges \\"fraudulent\\" and \\"abusive\\" changes to the internal operation of Canwest in the days before it filed for creditor protection. As part of the filing, the Wall Street investment bank is seeking to undo these changes, and has also claimed that CanWest's creditors should return the C$426 million they received from Canwest balance sheet in September, after CanWest sold its stake in Ten.Globe and Mail via FCB Nov 2, 2009. Friends.ca (November 2, 2009). On October 6, the company voluntarily filed for creditor protection under the CCAA, due to C$4 billion mounting debt across radio, television broadcasting and publishing assets in several countries. At the same time it announced it had agreed to a recapitalization transaction with some of its lenders, which will likely require the approval of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). When completed, bondholders - led by hedge funds West Face Capital, GoldenTree Asset Management, and Beach Point Capital Management - will own a majority of shares, leaving existing shareholders, including the Asper family, with a total of 2.3% of the \\"new\\" Canwest. However, the Aspers are expected to invest a further C$15 million in the restructured entity. In January 2010, CanWest's bonds commanded about 70 cents on the dollar. CanWest's bonds at one point traded for as little as 15 cents on the dollar. Several sources say that as CanWest notes increased fivefold in price, distressed-debt funds took profits on part of their position, with Angelo Gordon among the buyers. On February 3, 2010,, Montreal Gazette it was reported that a group led by Golden Tree Asset Management LP complained that \\"it was unfairly frozen out of the auction of Canwest Limited Partnership.\\" As part of the transaction, Canwest and some of its subsidiaries, including Canwest Media Inc., The National Post Company, and Canwest Television LP (the licensee of Global, MovieTime, DejaView, and Fox Sports World Canada) filed for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act. Canwest Limited Partnership, a subsidiary which owns the company's other newspaper assets and online properties, is negotiating separately with creditors, and is expected to file for creditor protection at a later date. Specialty channels operated in partnership with other companies (such as TVtropolis, Mystery TV, MenTV, and the former Alliance Atlantis properties) are also not included in the present filing. Canwest shares were also suspended from trading on the TSX. Canwest said that it was not being liquidated at this point, and the company insisted that the proceedings would make Canwest \\"a stronger industry competitor with a renewed financial outlook.\\" Nevertheless, some analysts expected that the conglomerate would sell assets or be broken up entirely as the restructuring process continues, noting that the publishing division has a separate set of lenders. As it turned out, the company would indeed be broken up. =Sale of assets to Shaw and Postmedia= In February 2010, the company announced an agreement with Shaw Communications whereby the latter company would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity, pending approvals from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and others. The company's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were already sold separately to Postmedia Network. However, the Asper family with Goldman and Catalyst made their own bid to retake Canwest with a $120 million bid in competition with the bid proposed by Shaw Communications.Asper Re-bid. Mediaincanada.com. On February 25, 2010, it was announced that Shaw Communications had won a court battle to continue their plans to purchase assets & voting shares from Canwest. After the announcement, Shaw revealed that its investment amounted to a minimum of $95-million in exchange for 20 per cent of the equity and an 80-per-cent voting interest in the restructured company. Although Goldman, Catalyst, and the Aspers continued to work on their own bid after the Shaw agreement, Shaw announced a revised agreement, following court ordered mediation, under which it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting operations, including the portion owned by Goldman. This deal was later modified following a second court ordered mediation to include a settlement agreement between Shaw, creditors, and the Official Ad Hoc Committee of Shareholders, led by the Aspers, Blott Asset Management, L.L.C. and two other hedge funds.\\"Asper willing to bid on Canwest TV assets\\".

Deadline Hollywood (January 9, 2012) After bankruptcy proceedings concluded, Canwest (by this point known as 2737469 Canada, Inc.) finally dissolved on May 27, 2013. In April 2016, the Shaw Media assets were subsumed by Shaw's sister company Corus Entertainment. Corporate governance =Board of directors= The last members of the board of directors of the company were Derek Burney, David Drybrough, David Kerr, Leonard Asper, Izzy Asper, Lisa Pankratz, Frank McKenna, David Asper, and Gail Asper. Gail Asper, David Asper, and Lisa Panktratz resigned from the board, and from all other director and officer positions within Canwest and its subsidiaries, on February 10, 2010. Concentration of power Canwest was often cited as an example of how the ownership of Canadian media has become concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and large corporations. Canwest founder Izzy Asper was known as a strong supporter of both Canada's Liberal Party and Israel's right-wing Likud party, and of many laissez-faire policies in both countries. Observers have suggested that Asper's political views have had a significant impact on news coverage at CanWest media outlets. For example, in 2002, Ottawa Citizen publisher Russell Mills was fired by Canwest after the paper published a series of articles exposing a financial scandal involving then Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien. Canwest's power in the marketplace was reflected in a contract that freelance contributors were required to sign. Until recently, standard industry practice was that freelancers sold the rights for one time use and only in Canada. Editorial controversies Since the 2000 acquisition of the major former Canadian newspaper holdings of Conrad Black's Hollinger International (now Sun-Times Media Group), including Canwest News Service, opposition has been expressed by some journalists, union spokespersons, politicians, and pundits about Canwest's enforcement of its corporate editorial positions. A 2001 decision to run regular uniform national editorials in all metropolitan dailies (except National Post), whereby local editorial boards could not take local positions on subjects of national editorials, ignited major national controversy and was subsequently withdrawn. Conflict over Canwest editorial control and policy has focused in particular on three issues: * The Liberal Party of Canada. Since Israel Asper's leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party, the Asper family has been identified with Liberal politics and politicians. In July 2001, Southam national affairs columnist Lawrence Martin was fired after a column of his critical of Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien was not published. Russell Mills, longtime publisher of The Ottawa Citizen, was fired in June 2002 after the newspaper called on Chr√©tien to resign. However, as of 2006, at least one Asper family member (David Asper) was publicly supporting the Conservatives. * The government of Israel and conflict in the Middle East. Veteran Montreal Gazette reporter Bill Marsden has said that the Aspers \\"do not want any criticism of Israel. We do not run in our newspaper op-ed pieces that express criticism of Israel and what it is doing.\\" A study released in 2006 by the Near East Cultural and Educational Foundation of Canada found that the National Post was 83.3 times more likely to report an Israeli child's death than a Palestinian child's death in its news articles' headlines or first paragraphs. In 2008 Canwest launched a lawsuit against the Palestine Media Collective for producing a newspaper parody of The Vancouver Sun that satirized this bias. In 2004, the Reuters news agency protested after Canwest altered newswire stories about the Iraq war and the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, such that Reuters felt it had inserted Canwest's own bias under Reuters bylines. The changes were apparently made in accordance with a Canwest policy to label certain groups as terrorists. Ottawa Citizen, a newspaper in the Canwest chain, made similar changes to a story by Associated Press. * Canwest editorial control and management itself. In December 2001, staff members at The Montreal Gazette launched a Gazette Newsroom web page with an open letter, titled Media Giant Silences Local Voices: Canadian Journalism Under Attack, that got signed by 77 Gazette journalists as of 2002 January 23, opposing the national editorial policy, and the reporters among them participated in a byline strike, refusing to sign their names to their stories in the newspaper in protest. Management responded with a gag order. The next year, several journalists left The Halifax Daily News over similar conflicts, and ten journalists at The Regina Leader-Post were reprimanded or suspended after a byline strike to protest censorship of coverage of a speech in Regina by Toronto Star columnist and Canwest critic Haroon Siddiqui. Upon acquiring Southam's Newspapers from Hollinger International, Israel Asper continued Conrad Black's policy of 'blacklisting' influential Canadian world and military affairs journalist Gwynne Dyer's internationally published articles. This antipathy was prompted by Dyer's views on conflict in the Middle East and his opposition to neoconservatism, which run contrary to the ideological views of Asper and others on Canwest's board of directors then and today. Partially as a response to this, Dyer published a collection of his articles on the Middle East and related topics called With Every Mistake in 2005. Canwest newspapers and broadcast outlets in British Columbia were regularly criticized for giving a \\"free ride\\" to the BC Liberal government of Premier Gordon Campbell, especially in relation to the scandals and controversies ensuing from the privatization of BC Rail but also in cooperating with the government's alleged manipulation of information for political purposes, such as the suppression of the actual scale of the deficit or welfare rates in advance of the 2009 election. Conversely, coverage of the New Democratic Party was criticized as being unfairly negative.The Legislature Raids blog. Retrieved August 2, 2009.Bill Tieleman (blog). Retrieved August 2, 2009.\\"Is Gordon Campbell a 'made man'?\\" , Republic of East Vancouver. Retrieved August 2, 2009.

Its current mayor is Leandro Altolaguirre. Founded in 1892 by Tom√°s Mason, Santa Rosa did not develop into a relatively important agricultural centre until the second half of the 20th century. It is still one of the smallest provincial capitals of the country after Patagonian Rawson, Ushuaia and Viedma. City sights include the Fitte neighbourhood (1930), the monument to San Mart√≠n, the Palace of Justice, the Teatro Espa√±ol Theatre (1908), the Provincial Art Museum (with paintings by Ra√∫l Soldi, Antonio Berni, Quinquela Mart√≠n and other important Argentine painters) and the Provincial Natural History Museum. The Santa Rosa Airport is located 2 kilometres from Santa Rosa on Route 35, and serves regular flights to Buenos Aires. Near Santa Rosa is the city of Toay, together both cities form the Gran Santa Rosa metropolitan area. Geography Street map of Santa Rosa downtown Santa Rosa was founded on the western edge of the Argentine Pampas, in the range of contact of two different natural environments: the end of the plain and the beginning of the land of the Pampas broken valley. The town occupies part of a centripetal basin having their base in Don Tom√°s Lagoon, where to drain rainwater from the surrounding area. The floor area lies west of it, in hilly terrain where the highest elevations are in the east, with two small plateaus located 200 meters. This high turnover is also observed north, with heights up to 195 meters. From here the terrain descends to the west and south, with slopes that are steep in some areas, since more than 3%. The southwest sector is lower and less undulating area, descending to 167 masl. =Climate= Santa Rosa has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa/Cwa, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), with warm to hot summers and chilly, dry winters. The highest temperature recorded was on January 6, 1955 while the record low is on June 13, 1967.

The settlement initially developed as a strategic site on the mule trade route between San Miguel de Tucum√°n and the silver mines in Potos√≠, Bolivia. Reaching its peak importance during the colonial period, San Salvador de Jujuy declined to the status of a remote provincial capital after the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816. The town became the capital of Jujuy Province when the latter separated from Salta Province in 1834. The 1863 Jujuy earthquake leveled the town, and it recovered slowly in the following decades. Jujuy began to grow following the arrival of the Northern Central Railway in 1900. Its first institution of higher learning, the Economic Sciences Institute, was established in 1959, and was incorporated into the new National University of Jujuy in 1973. The city was the location of a number of Argentine films, including Veronico Cruz (1988) and Una estrella y dos caf√©s (2005). The city's impoverished Lower Azopardo neighborhood would later give rise to Milagro Sala's Indigenist Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association.  Climate  Jujuy has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), mainly because of the altitude. Summers bring warm days at 28 ¬∞C (82 ¬∞F) and nights at 16 ¬∞C (61 ¬∞F) with frequent thunderstorms. The rest of the year is sunny, with temperatures at about 24 ¬∞C (75 ¬∞F) during the day and 11 ¬∞C (52 ¬∞F) at night, crisp, dry winters with warm days of 19 ¬∞C (66 ¬∞F) and cold nights at 6 ¬∞C (39 ¬∞F), and sunny springs with warm days (26 ¬∞C, or 79 ¬∞F) and cool nights (11 ¬∞C, 52 ¬∞F). During heat waves, temperatures can sometimes reach 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) but these are not frequent and nights always bring significant cooling, as opposed to many low-lying areas in Northern Argentina. During the winter, temperatures can reach ‚àí7 ¬∞C (19 ¬∞F) and snow, although rare, may fall on occasion. Precipitation is about 800 mm, which falls in the form of thunderstorms during the warmest months. The highest temperature recorded was on October 16, 2014 while the lowest temperature recorded was on August 14, 1978.

It has a population of 346,334 according to the 2010 Census. It lies opposite its twin city, Resistencia, Chaco. Corrientes has a mix of colonial and modern architecture, several churches and a number of lapacho, ceibo, jacaranda and orange trees. It is also home to one of the biggest carnival celebrations in the country. The annual average temperature is . The annual rainfall is around .  Transportation  The General Belgrano Bridge crosses the Paran√° River that serves as the natural border with the neighbouring Chaco Province. On the other side of the bridge is Resistencia, capital of Chaco. To the west and up the Paran√°, between Paraguay and Argentina, lies the Yaciret√° dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power generators in the world. The Doctor Fernando Piragine Niveyro International Airport at coordinates , away from the city, serves the city. The Ferrocarril Econ√≥mico Correntino narrow gauge railway line to Mburucuy√° operated from 1912 until 1927.  History  In 1516 Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s commanded the first expedition to reach the area populated mainly by Guaran√≠ aboriginals, but his expedition was attacked and Sol√≠s perished in the adventure. Plan of the city of Corrientes in June 1867. Sebastian Cabot established in 1527 the Sancti Spiritu fort upstream of the Paran√° River, and in 1536 Pedro de Mendoza reached further north into the basin of the river, searching for the Sierras of Silver. Juan Torres de Vera y Arag√≥n founded on April 3, 1588 San Juan de Vera de las Siete Corrientes (\\"Saint John of Vera of the Seven Currents\\"), which was later shortened to Corrientes. The \\"seven currents\\" refer to the seven peninsulas on the shore of the river at this place, that produced wild currents that made difficult the navigation of the river through this part. Nevertheless, its position between Asunci√≥n - in present Paraguay - and Buenos Aires made it an important middle point, especially because of its 55-metre-high lands that prevent flooding when the water level rises. In 1615 Jesuits settled near the Uruguay River. In 1807 the city resisted the British invasions. During the Argentine War of Independence it was in permanent conflict with the centralist government of Buenos Aires, but the Paraguayan War united them after the city was attacked by Paraguayan forces in 1865.  Climate  The annual average temperature is . The annual rainfall is around . The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \\"Cfa\\" (Humid Subtropical Climate).Climate Summary for Corrientes Frosts are rare; with the dates of the first and last frost being July 5 and July 12 respectively, indicating that most of the year is frost free.

The character was introduced on the cover of the first issue in 1977 and is one of only two characters to appear in almost every issue of the comic, the other being Judge Dredd. Tharg rarely appears in stories but strips involving him have been written by such notable writers as Alan Grant, Alan Moore and John Wagner, albeit usually credited to \\"TMO\\" - \\"The Mighty One\\". Characterisation Tharg is depicted as an alien from Quaxxann, a fictional planet that orbits the star Betelgeuse. The character has green skin, a white mohawk hairstyle and a red device called the rosette of Sirius on his forehead. He is written and performed for comic effect as an authoritarian egoist. He eats polystyrene cups. Tharg writes the comic's introduction, answers letters, and doles out prizes to readers (for artwork or story suggestions) - winners could choose payment either in pounds sterling or in \\"galactic groats\\". Tharg speaks mostly in English, but with various pithy Betelgusian aphorisms thrown in for colour. In addition to the editorial duties in 2000 AD being attributed to Tharg, all writing, art, lettering, sub- editing and PR is attributed to malcontent, feckless and long-suffering droids that appear as caricatures of their actual counterparts. In one episode, a Tharg suit in the comic's office was explained as a skin that Tharg had shed.  Creation and concept  The concept of using a fictional character to host the comic is comparable to the tradition of hosts in horror comics. It was commonplace in British comics in the 1970s when 2000 AD began publication. For example, Warlord was supposedly edited by Lord Peter Flint and Bullet by a character named Fireball. 2000 AD's short-lived sister title Starlord used a similar device with the eponymous alien Starlord as did Tornado with Big E. Pat Mills created Tharg but since regrets it, in 2015 describing him as an anachronism. In 1996 David Bishop was determined to get rid of Tharg and challenge the status quo, so replaced him as host in #1014 with the Vector 13 Men in Black. Reader reaction was \\"strong and vitriolic\\" and Tharg was reinstated in #1032. Bishop came to realise that Tharg is an intrinsic part of 2000 AD and that the Men in Black were \\"a tiresome encumbrance\\". Tharg's return and the ousting of the Men in Black was covered in the Vector 13 story \\"Case Ten: Case Closed?\\" Comic strips 2000 AD regularly features self- contained, science-fiction short stories called Tharg's Future Shocks. Tharg is generally characterised as the host or presenter of these one-shots. The format also sub-divides into genre-specific variants including: Tharg's 3rillers, Tharg's Alien Invasions, Tharg's Dragon Tales, and Tharg's Terror Tales. On occasion 2000 AD includes short humorous strips that feature Tharg as a character. The plots often concern Tharg's conflict with Thrillsuckers, a plague of psychic pests that attempt to steal 2000 AD's Thrillpower, his abuse of his droid staff, and his battles against The Dictators of Zrag, rulers of the dull cube-shaped planet Zrag. This trio of incompetent alien warlords hope to usurp Tharg's position and use the comic's powers to revitalise their planet. Tharg uses the Dictators as convenient scapegoats whom he can blame for printing errors and plot holes. = Publication history = * Tharg and the Intruder (art by Kevin O‚ÄôNeill, in #24, 1977) * Captain Klep (written by Dave Angus, art by Robin Smith and unknown artists, in #127, #139, 1979) * A Day in the Life of the Mighty Tharg (art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #129, 1979) * Tharg's XMas Tale (art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #145, 1979) * Judge Dredd - Christmas Party (art by Keith Page, in Dan Dare Annual, 1980) * The Final Secret (art Robin Smith, in Sci-Fi Special, 1980) * What Tharg Did on Sunday (art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #146, 1980) * This is Your Life (art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #155, 1980) * Tharg and the Cheat (written by Alan Grant, art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #162, 1980) * The Great Human Rip-Off (written by Alan Grant, art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #176-77, 1980) * Tharg and the Thrill Suckers (art by Carlos Ezquerra, in #180, 1980) * Tharg Strikes Back!

By definition, an operator A is symmetric if : \\\\langle A x  y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x  A y\\\\rangle for all x, y in the domain of A. Note that symmetric everywhere-defined operators are necessarily self-adjoint, so this theorem can also be stated as follows: an everywhere-defined self-adjoint operator is bounded. The theorem is named after Ernst David Hellinger and Otto Toeplitz. This theorem can be viewed as an immediate corollary of the closed graph theorem, as self-adjoint operators are closed. Alternatively, it can be argued using the uniform boundedness principle. One relies on the symmetric assumption, therefore the inner product structure, in proving the theorem. Also crucial is the fact that the given operator A is defined everywhere (and, in turn, the completeness of Hilbert spaces). The Hellinger‚ÄìToeplitz theorem reveals certain technical difficulties in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. Observables in quantum mechanics correspond to self-adjoint operators on some Hilbert space, but some observables (like energy) are unbounded. By Hellinger‚ÄìToeplitz, such operators cannot be everywhere defined (but they may be defined on a dense subset). Take for instance the quantum harmonic oscillator. Here the Hilbert space is L2(R), the space of square integrable functions on R, and the energy operator H is defined by (assuming the units are chosen such that ‚Ñè = m = œâ = 1) : [Hf](x) = - \\\\frac12 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^2} f(x) + \\\\frac12 x^2 f(x). This operator is self-adjoint and unbounded (its eigenvalues are 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...), so it cannot be defined on the whole of L2(R).

The number of specialty channels has greatly increased during the 1990s and 2000s while the previously common model of countries having just a few (national) TV stations addressing all interest groups and demographics became increasingly outmoded, as it already had been for some time in several countries. About 65% of today's satellite channels are specialty channels. Types of specialty services may include, but by no means are limited to: * Adult channels * Children's interest channels * Documentary channels * Men's interest channels * Movie channels * Music channels * News channels * Public affairs (broadcasting) * Public, educational, and government access * Quiz channels * Shopping channels * Sports channels * Religious broadcasting * Women's interest channels (These categories are provided for convenience and do not necessarily represent industry-accepted or otherwise legally-binding names or categories for these types of services.) Some specialty channels may not be free-to-air or may not be available through conventional broadcast or terrestrial television. In the United States, such networks are colloquially referred to as cable channels or cable networks (regardless of distribution method), with the most widely distributed referred to as \\"basic cable\\" networks. In the U.S., specialty services also operate as broadcast television networks designed to be carried on digital subchannels of terrestrial stations (which proliferated following the transition from analog broadcasting), with the largest usually focusing on library programming catering to specific genres or demographics.  Canadian specialty channels  The term \\"specialty channel\\" has been used most frequently in Canada, having been used as a marketing term by the cable industry for various simultaneous launches of new channels throughout the 1990s. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) term for such a channel is specialty service (or even more explicitly \\"specialty television programming undertaking\\"), referring to virtually any non-premium television service which is not carried over the airwaves or otherwise deemed exempt by the CRTC. They are primarily carried, therefore, on cable television and satellite television. The CRTC previously enforced strict regulations on the types of programming that may be carried by specialty services, employing minimums and restrictions across specific genres on a per-licence basis, and a category system granting exclusive rights to specific categories of channels. These restrictions were imposed to discourage networks from deviating from the programming format which they were licensed to broadcast. Under a deregulation scheme, the CRTC has since replaced these with streamlined, standard terms for most specialty channels (discretionary services), whose only major restrictions are on the broadcast of live sports programming. Contrarily, a service licensed as a mainstream sports network is restricted in their carriage of non-sport programming.

Turkey  After the failed coup attempt in 2016, the government of Turkey blamed the G√ºlen movement for the coup and authorities have arrested thousands of soldiers and judges. This was followed by the dismissal, detention or suspension of over 160,000 officials.  Soviet Union  Prosecutor General Andrey Vyshinsky (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against Karl Radek during the 2nd Moscow Trial As early as 1922, Lenin advocated staging several \\"model trials\\" (\\"–ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å\\", literally \\"demonstrative trial\\", \\"a process showing an example\\") in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Ukraine. Show trials were common during Joseph Stalin's political repressions, such as the Moscow Trials of the Great Purge period (1937‚Äì38). The Soviet authorities staged the actual trials meticulously. If defendants refused to \\"cooperate\\"‚Äîi.e., to admit guilt for their alleged and mostly fabricated crimes‚Äîthey did not go on public trial, but suffered execution nonetheless. This happened, for example during the prosecution of the so-called , a party invented in the late 1920s by the OGPU, which, in particular, assigned the notable economist Alexander Chayanov (1888-1937, arrested in 1930) to it. Some solid public evidence of what really happened during the Moscow Trials came to the West through the Dewey Commission (1937). After the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), more information became available. This discredited the New York Times reporter Walter Duranty, who claimed at the time that these trials were actually fair.  Eastern Europe  Captain Witold Pilecki, former prisoner at Auschwitz during a show trial conducted by communist authorities in Poland in 1948 Following some dissent within ruling communist parties throughout the Eastern Bloc, especially after the 1948 Tito‚ÄìStalin split, several party purges occurred, with several hundred thousand members purged in several countries. In addition to rank-and- file member purges, prominent communists were purged, with some subjected to public show trials. These were more likely to be instigated, and sometimes orchestrated, by the Kremlin or even Stalin himself, as he had done in the earlier Moscow Trials. Such high-ranking party show trials included those of Ko√ßi Xoxe in Albania and Traicho Kostov in Bulgaria, who were purged and arrested. After Kostov was executed, Bulgarian leaders sent Stalin a telegram thanking him for the help. In Romania, Lucre≈£iu PƒÉtrƒÉ≈ücanu, Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca were arrested, with PƒÉtrƒÉ≈ücanu being executed. The Soviets generally directed show trial methods throughout the Eastern Bloc, including a procedure in which confessions and evidence from leading witnesses could be extracted by any means, including threatening to torture the witnesses‚Äô wives and children. The higher-ranking the party member, generally the more harsh the torture that was inflicted upon him. For the show trial of Hungarian Interior Minister J√°nos K√°d√°r, who one year earlier had attempted to force a confession of Rajk in his show trial, regarding \\"Vladimir\\" the questioner of K√°d√°r: The evidence was often not just non-existent but absurd, with Hungarian George Paloczi-Horv√°th‚Äôs party interrogators delightedly exclaiming \\"We knew all the time‚Äîwe have it here in writing‚Äîthat you met professor Szentgy√∂rgyi not in Istanbul, but in Constantinople.\\" In another case, the Hungarian √ÅVH secret police also condemned another party member as a Nazi accomplice with a document that had actually been previously displayed in glass cabinet of the Institute of the Working Class Movement as an example of a Gestapo forgery. The trials themselves were \\"shows\\", with each participant having to learn a script and conduct repeated rehearsals before the performance. In the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial in Czechoslovakia, when the judge skipped one of the scripted questions, the better-rehearsed Sl√°nsk√Ω answered the one which should have been asked. =Yugoslavia= In 1946, Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and a number of other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement during World War II were tried for high treason and war crimes committed during WWII. The trial opened in the presence of about 60 foreign journalists. Mihailoviƒá and ten others were sentenced to death by a firing squad (two in absentia); the others in the process were convicted to penalties ranging from 18 months to 20 years in prison. In 2015, a Serbian court invalidated Mihailoviƒá's conviction. The court held that it had been a Communist political show trial that was controlled by the government. The court concluded that Mihailoviƒá had not received a fair trial. Mihailoviƒá was, therefore, fully rehabilitated. =Hungary= Stalin's NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary M√°ty√°s R√°kosi and his √ÅVH head the way the show trial of Hungarian Minister of Interior L√°szl√≥ Rajk should go, and he was later executed. =Czechoslovakia= The Rajk trials in Hungary led Moscow to warn Czechoslovakia's parties that enemy agents had penetrated even high into party ranks, and when a puzzled Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω and Klement Gottwald inquired what they could do, Stalin's NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials. First, these trials focused on people outside the Czechoslovak Communist party. General Heliodor P√≠ka was arrested without a warrant in early May 1948 and accused of espionage and high treason, damaging the interests of the Czechoslovak Republic and the Soviet Union, and undermining the ability of the state to defend itself, P√≠ka was not allowed to present a defence, and no witnesses were called. He was sentenced to death and hanged. During the Prague Spring of 1968, P√≠ka's case was reopened at the request of Milan P√≠ka (son of Heliodor) and the elder P√≠ka's lawyer, and a military tribunal declared Heliodor P√≠ka innocent of all charges. Milada Hor√°kov√°, a Czech politician focused on social issues and women's rights, who was jailed during the German occupation for her political activity, was accused of leading a conspiracy to commit treason and espionage at the behest of the United States, Great Britain, France and Yugoslavia. Evidence of the alleged conspiracy included Hor√°kov√°'s presence at a meeting of political figures from the National Socialist, Social Democrat and People's parties, in September 1948, held to discuss their response to the new political situation in Czechoslovakia. She was also accused of maintaining contacts with Czechoslovak political figures in exile in the West. The trial of Hor√°kov√° and twelve of her colleagues began on 31 May 1950 and he State's prosecutors were led by Dr. Josef Urv√°lek and included Ludmila Bro≈æov√°-Polednov√°. The trial proceedings were carefully orchestrated with confessions of guilt secured from the accused, though a recording of the event, discovered in 2005, revealed Hor√°kov√°'s courageous defence of her political ideals. Milada Hor√°kov√° was sentenced to death, along with three co-defendants (Jan Buchal, Old≈ôich Pecl, and Z√°vi≈° Kalandra), on 8 June 1950. Many prominent figures in the West, notably Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt, petitioned for her life, but the sentences were confirmed. She was executed by hanging in Prague's Pankr√°c Prison on 27 June 1950 Then, the trials turned to the communist party itself (Sl√°nsk√Ω trial). In November 1952 Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω and 13 other high-ranking Communist bureaucrats (Bed≈ôich Geminder, Ludv√≠k Frejka, Josef Frank, Vladim√≠r Clementis, Bed≈ôich Reicin, Karel ≈†v√°b, Rudolf Margolius, Otto ≈†ling, Andr√© Simone, Artur London, Vavro Hajd≈Ø and Ev≈æen L√∂bl), 10 of whom were Jews, were arrested and charged with being Titoists and Zionists, official USSR rhetoric having turned against Zionism. Party rhetoric asserted that Sl√°nsk√Ω was spying as part of an international western capitalist conspiracy to undermine socialism and that punishing him would avenge the Nazi murders of Czech communists Jan ≈†verma and Julius Fuƒç√≠k during World War II. The trial of the 14 national leaders began on 20 November 1952, in the Senate of the State Court, with the prosecutor being Josef Urv√°lek. It lasted eight days. It was notable for its strong anti-Semitic overtones. All were found guilty and except for three who were sentenced to life inprisonment, they were all sentenced to death. Sl√°nsk√Ω was hanged at Pankr√°c Prison on 3 December 1952. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered on an icy road outside of Prague. =Romania= As the end of the 1989 Romanian Revolution neared, First Secretary of the Communist Party Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and his wife Elena were condemned to death and shot dead by a firing squad after a Stalinist-style trial in a kangaroo court.Nicolae »ôi Elena Ceau»ôescu: ‚Äû√émpreunƒÉ am luptat, sƒÉ murim √ÆmpreunƒÉ!‚Äú AdevƒÉrul, 19 December 2009.

This function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones of the vertebral skeleton. The osteoclast disassembles and digests the composite of hydrated protein and mineral at a molecular level by secreting acid and a collagenase, a process known as bone resorption. This process also helps regulate the level of blood calcium. Osteoclasts are found on those surfaces of bone which are undergoing resorption. On such surfaces, the osteoclasts are seen to be located in shallow depressions called resorption bays (Howship's lacunae). The resorption bays are created by erosive action of osteoclasts on the underlying bone. The border of the lower part of an osteoclast exhibits finger-like processes due to presence of deep infoldings of the cell membrane; this border is called ruffled border. The ruffled border lies in contact with the bone surface within a resorption bay. The periphery of the ruffled border is surrounded by a ring-like zone of cytoplasm which is devoid of cell organelles but is rich in actin filaments. This zone is called clear zone or sealing zone. The actin filaments enable the cell membrane surrounding the sealing zone to be anchored firmly to the bony wall of Howship's lacunae. In this way, a closed subosteoclastic compartment is created between the ruffled border and the bone that is undergoing resorption. The osteoclasts secrete hydrogen ions, collagenase, cathepsin K and hydrolytic enzymes into this compartment. Resorption of bone matrix by the osteoclasts involves two steps: (1) dissolution of inorganic components (minerals), and (2) digestion of organic component of the bone matrix. The osteoclasts pump hydrogen ions into subosteoclastic compartment and thus create an acidic microenvironment, which increases solubility of bone mineral, resulting in the release and re-entry of bone minerals into the cytoplasm of osteoclasts to be delivered to nearby capillaries. After the removal of minerals, collagenase and gelatinase are secreted into the subosteoclastic compartment. These enzymes digest and degrade collagen and other organic components of decalcified bone matrix. The degradation products are phagocytosed by osteoclasts at the ruffled border. Because of their phagocytic properties, osteoclasts are considered to be a component of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The activity of osteoclasts is controlled by hormones and cytokines. Calcitonin, a hormone of thyroid gland, suppresses the osteoclastic activity. The osteoclasts do not have receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, PTH stimulates the osteoblasts to secrete the cytokine called osteoclast-stimulating factor, which is a potent stimulator of the osteoclastic activity.Medical Histology by Laiq Hussain Siddiqui (6th Edition) An odontoclast (/odon¬∑to¬∑clast/; o-don¬¥to- klast) is an osteoclast associated with absorption of the roots of deciduous teeth. Structure Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive osteoclast in cell culture Illustrated cross-section of an activated osteoclast An osteoclast is a large multinucleated cell and human osteoclasts on bone typically have five nuclei and are 150‚Äì200 ¬µm in diameter. When osteoclast- inducing cytokines are used to convert macrophages to osteoclasts, very large cells that may reach 100 ¬µm in diameter occur. These may have dozens of nuclei, and typically express major osteoclast proteins but have significant differences from cells in living bone because of the not-natural substrate. The size of the multinucleated assembled osteoclast allows it to focus the ion transport, protein secretory and vesicular transport capabilities of many macrophages on a localized area of bone. = Location = In bone, osteoclasts are found in pits in the bone surface which are called resorption bays, or Howship's lacunae. Osteoclasts are characterized by a cytoplasm with a homogeneous, \\"foamy\\" appearance. This appearance is due to a high concentration of vesicles and vacuoles. These vacuoles include lysosomes filled with acid phosphatase. This permits characterization of osteoclasts by their staining for high expression of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K. Osteoclast rough endoplasmic reticulum is sparse, and the Golgi complex is extensive. At a site of active bone resorption, the osteoclast forms a specialized cell membrane, the \\"ruffled border\\", that opposes the surface of the bone tissue. This extensively folded or ruffled border facilitates bone removal by dramatically increasing the cell surface for secretion and uptake of the resorption compartment contents and is a morphologic characteristic of an osteoclast that is actively resorbing bone. Development Since their discovery in 1873 there has been considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy it is now clear that these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was in the beginning of 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor Œ∫Œ≤ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony- stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors. M-CSF acts through its receptor on the osteoclast, c-fms (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase-receptor, leading to secondary messenger activation of tyrosine kinase Src. Both of these molecules are necessary for osteoclastogenesis and are widely involved in the differentiation of monocyte/macrophage derived cells. RANKL is a member of the tumour necrosis family (TNF), and is essential in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL knockout mice exhibit a phenotype of osteopetrosis and defects of tooth eruption, along with an absence or deficiency of osteoclasts. RANKL activates NF-Œ∫Œ≤ (nuclear factor-Œ∫Œ≤) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1) through RANK. NF-Œ∫Œ≤ activation is stimulated almost immediately after RANKL-RANK interaction occurs and is not upregulated. NFATc1 stimulation, however, begins ~24‚Äì48 hours after binding occurs and its expression has been shown to be RANKL dependent. Osteoclast differentiation is inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which is produced by osteoblasts and binds to RANKL thereby preventing interaction with RANK. It may be important to note that while osteoclasts are derived from the hematopoietic lineage, osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. Function Once activated, osteoclasts move to areas of microfracture in the bone by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in small cavities called Howship's lacunae, formed from the digestion of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as Œ±vŒ≤3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 ‚Üí HCO3‚àí \\\\+ H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis. Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted in the prevention of osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. These enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin K is of most importance. =Cathepsin K and other cathepsins= Cathepsin K is a collagenolytic, papain-like, cysteine protease that is mainly expressed in osteoclasts, and is secreted into the resorptive pit. Cathepsin K is the major protease involved in the degradation of type I collagen and other noncollagenous proteins. Mutations in the cathepsin K gene are associated with pycnodysostosis, a hereditary osteopetrotic disease, characterised by a lack of functional cathepsin K expression. Knockout studies of cathepsin K in mice lead to an osteopetrotic phenotype, which, is partially compensated by increased expression of proteases other that cathepsin K and enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Cathepsin K has an optimal enzymatic activity in acidic conditions. It is synthesized as a proenzyme with a molecular weight of 37kDa, and upon activation by autocatalytic cleavage, is transformed into the mature, active form with a molecular weight of ~27kDa. Upon polarization of the osteoclast over the site of resorption, cathepsin K is secreted from the ruffled border into the resorptive pit. Cathepsin K transmigrates across the ruffled border by intercellular vesicles and is then released by the functional secretory domain. Within these intercellular vesicles, cathepsin K, along with reactive oxygen species generated by TRAP, further degrades the bone extracellular matrix. Several other cathepsins are expressed in osteoclasts including cathepsins B, C, D, E, G, and L. The function of these cysteine and aspartic proteases is generally unknown within bone, and they are expressed at much lower levels than cathepsin K. Studies on cathepsin L knockout mice have been mixed, with a report of reduced trabecular bone in homozygous and heterozygous cathepsin L knockout mice compared to wild-type and another report finding no skeletal abnormalities. =Matrix metalloproteinases= The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) comprise a family of more than 20 zinc-dependent endopeptidases. The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in osteoclast biology is ill-defined, but in other tissue they have been linked with tumor promoting activities, such as activation of growth factors and are required for tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. MMP9 is associated with the bone microenvironment. It is expressed by osteoclasts, and is known to be required for osteoclast migration and is a powerful gelatinase. Transgenic mice lacking MMP-9 develop defects in bone development, intraosseous angiogenesis, and fracture repair. MMP-13 is believed to be involved in bone resorption and in osteoclast differentiation, as knockout mice revealed decreased osteoclast numbers, osteopetrosis, and decreased bone resorption. MMPs expressed by the osteoclast include MMP-9, -10, -12, and -14. apart from MMP-9, little is known about their relevance to the osteoclast, however, high levels of MMP-14 are found at the sealing zone. = Osteoclast physiology = In the 1980s and 90s the physiology of typical osteoclasts was studied in detail. With the isolation of the ruffled border, ion transport across it was studied directly in biochemical detail. Energy- dependent acid transport was verified and the postulated proton pump purified. With the successful culture of osteoclasts, it became apparent that they are organized to support the massive transport of protons for acidification of the resorption compartment and solubilization of the bone mineral. This includes ruffled border Cl‚àí permeability to control membrane potential and basolateral Cl‚àí/HCO3‚àí exchange to maintain cytosolic pH in physiologically acceptable ranges.> The effectiveness of its ion secretion depends upon the osteoclast forming an effective seal around the resorption compartment. The positioning of this \\"sealing zone\\" appears to be mediated by integrins expressed on the osteoclast surface. With the sealing zone in place, the multinucleated osteoclast reorganizes itself. Developing the highly invaginated ruffled membrane apposing the resorption compartment allows massive secretory activity. In addition, it permits the vesicular transcytosis of the mineral and degraded collagen from the ruffled border to the free membrane of the cell, and its release into the extracellular compartment. This activity completes the bone resorption, and both the mineral components and collagen fragments are released to the general circulation. = Regulation = Osteoclasts are regulated by several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland, calcitonin from the thyroid gland, and growth factor interleukin 6 (IL-6). This last hormone, IL-6, is one of the factors in the disease osteoporosis, which is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand. Note that these molecules also regulate differentiation of the osteoclast. Odontoclast An odontoclast (/odon¬∑to¬∑clast/; o-don¬¥to- klast) is an osteoclast associated with absorption of the roots of deciduous teeth. Alternate use of term An osteoclast can also be an instrument used to fracture and reset bones (the origin is Greek osteon: bone and klastos: broken). To avoid confusion, the cell was originally termed osotoclast. When the surgical instrument went out of use, the cell became known by its present name.  Clinical significance  Giant osteoclasts can occur in some diseases, including Paget's disease of bone and bisphosphonate toxicity. In cats, abnormal odontoclast activity can cause feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, necessitating extraction of the affected teeth.  History  Osteoclasts were discovered by Kolliker in 1873.

On the other hand, the easy melodic quality and clean intonation of Goodman's band made it possible to \\"sell\\" jazz to a mass audience.Berendt, Joachim, \\"Swing ‚Äì 1930.\\" In The Jazz Book, 15-16. St Albans: Paladin, 1976. The swing era brought to swing music Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, and by 1938 Ella Fitzgerald. Armstrong, who had heavily influenced jazz as its greatest soloist in the 1920s when working with both small bands and larger ones, now appeared only with big swing bands. Other musicians who rose during this time include Jimmy Dorsey, his brother Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Goodman's future rival Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, who departed the Isham Jones band in 1936 to start his own band. Several factors led to the demise of the swing era: the 1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike from August 1942 to November 1944 (The union that most jazz musicians belong to told its members not to record until the record companies agreed to pay them each time their music was played on the radio), the earlier ban of ASCAP songs from radio stations, World War II which made it harder for bands to travel around as well as the \\"cabaret tax\\", which was as high as 30%, the rise of vocalist-centered pop and R&B; as the dominant forms of popular music, and the rising interest in bebop among jazz musicians. Though some big bands survived through the late 1940s (Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Boyd Raeburn, Woody Herman), most of their competitors were forced to disband, bringing the swing era to a close. Big-band jazz would experience a resurgence starting in the mid-1950s, but it would never attain the same popularity as it had during the swing era. Musical elements =Beat= During the 1920s the older two-beat style of jazz was superseded by four-beat jazz, facilitated by replacement of the sousaphone with the string bass. Four beat rhythm was the foundation of the Chicago style jazz developed by Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines, and of the swing era rhythmic styles. The change in rhythm started first with solo pianists and small ensembles, then larger ensembles towards the end of the decade. Toward the end of the twenties the two-beat styles seemed all but exhausted. First in Chicago, then in Harlem and Kansas City, a new way of playing developed around 1928-29. Chicago musicians migrating to Harlem brought their rhythmic ideas with them. As is so often the case in jazz, there are confusing exceptions to this general outline. Jimmie Lunceford‚Äôs big band at the height of the Swing era employed a beat that was simultaneously 2/4 and 4/4.Berendt, Joachim, ‚ÄúSwing ‚Äì 1930.‚Äù In The Jazz Book, 15-16. St Albans: Paladin, 1976. The Bob Crosby Orchestra and the Lionel Hampton Orchestra also featured two-beat rhythms long after four-beat rhythm became the standard. =Rhythm sections= In May 1935, the No. 1 record in the country was Jimmie Lunceford‚Äôs ‚ÄúRhythm Is Our Business.‚Äù Released a few months before Benny Goodman triggered the national craze known as swing, the song offered a foretaste of the coming deluge. ‚ÄúRhythm is our business/ Rhythm is what we sell,‚Äù Lunceford‚Äôs singer declared: ‚ÄúRhythm is our business / Business sure is swell.‚ÄùGiddins, Gary and Scott DeVeaux. ‚ÄúRhythm in Transition.‚Äù In Jazz, 255-68. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. If rhythm defined the swing bands, its foundation lay in the rhythm section: piano, guitar, bass, and drums. In big bands, rhythm sections fused into a unified rhythmic front: supplying the beat and marking the harmonies. Each of the leading bands presented a distinct, well-designed rhythmic attack that complemented its particular style. The rhythm sections of Ellington, Basie, and Lunceford, for example, sounded nothing alike. Just as the soloists were champing at the bit of big-band constraints, rhythm players were developing techniques and ideas that demanded more attention than they usually received. In the 1930s, rhythm instruments made dramatic advances toward the foreground of jazz. In the process, they helped set the stage for bebop. In 1939, Duke Ellington discovered virtuoso young bassist Jimmie Blanton and hired him into his Orchestra. Blanton revolutionized the bass as a featured instrument in the band, until he tragically left the band in late 1941 due to terminal tuberculosis. Towards the end of the 1930s the roles of the piano, bass, and drums in the rhythm section changed significantly under the influence of the Count Basie Orchestra. Early swing drumming relied heavily on the bass and snare drums, with a secondary role for the high hat cymbal in timekeeping. Jo Jones inverted that relationship, making the high hat the primary timekeeper and using the bass and snare drums for accents and lead-ins. Basie introduced a rhythmically sparse style of piano playing emphasizing accents, lead-ins, and fills. Both of those changes increased the importance of the bass and guitar in timekeeping, ably held by Walter Page and Freddie Green. The lighter and sparser, yet more dynamic, sense of rhythm expressed by the Basie rhythm section lent greater freedom for the band's soloists and set a trend that would culminate in the rhythmic ideas of bebop. =Instruments= To help bands adjust to the new groove, major changes were made in the rhythm section. While the bass drum continued to play a rock-solid four beat pulse, the tuba, commonly used in large dance bands of the 1920s, was replaced by the string bass. During the early years of recording, the tuba was able to project a clear, huffing sound. But the string bass had been replacing the tuba over the rhythmic devices available with it and many players, including Wellman Braud with Duke Ellington‚Äôs band, showed that the instrument had a special percussive flavor when the strings were given a pizzicato ‚Äúslap‚Äù (plucked rather than bowed). Change came gradually in the late 1920s, once word had gotten around about how well the string bass worked; many tuba players realized that they‚Äôd better switch instruments or lose their jobs. With Walter Page's bass replacing the tuba in Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra, the way was laid clear for the band to develop the kinetic style of swing it would show under the leadership of Count Basie. The banjo, with its loud and raucous tone, was replaced with the guitar, which provided a more subtle and secure pulsation (chunk-chunk) in the foundation rhythm. As the saying went, the guitar was more felt than heard. Listeners felt the combined sound of bass, guitar, and drums as a sonic force that pushed through cavernous dance halls. ‚ÄúIf you were on the first floor, and the dance hall was upstairs,‚Äù Count Basie remembered, ‚Äúthat was what you would hear, that steady rump, rump, rump, rump in that medium tempo.‚Äù As often noted by commentators on jazz history, the Swing era saw the saxophone supersede in many ways the trumpet as the dominant jazz solo instrument. Swing arrangements often emphasized the reed section to carry the melody, with trumpets providing accents and highlights. For this reason the types of solo improvisations would change dramatically during the thirties. Trumpeter Roy Eldridge deviated from the more common Armstrong- influenced styles towards a style of improvisation resembling that of reed players, and in turn would be an early influence on bebop trumpet pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter broke the barrier to early acceptance of the saxophone as a jazz instrument but it was the style of Frankie Trumbauer on C melody sax, showcased in the recordings he did with Bix Beiderbecke in 1927, that laid the groundwork for the style of saxophone playing that would make it a dominant influence on soloing styles.Oliphant, Dave. ‚ÄúPrecursors to and the Birth of Big-Band Swing.‚Äù In The Early Swing Era, 32-38. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2002. Lester Young, whose influence on saxophone playing became dominant towards the end of the 1930s, cited Trumbauer's linear, melodic approach to improvisation as his main inspiration for his own style. The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in 1927 consisted of two trumpets, two trombones, three reeds, piano, banjo, tuba, and drums. The Goodman band in 1935 had three trumpets, two trombones, the leader‚Äôs clarinet, two alto saxes, two tenor saxes, piano, guitar, bass, and drums, fourteen pieces in all, compared to Henderson‚Äôs eleven in the earlier days. The piano- guitar-bass-drums rhythm section had become standard and kept a steady and uncluttered beat that was very easy to follow. Goodman was quite skilled at setting the perfect dance tempo for each song while alternating wild ‚Äúkiller dillers‚Äù with slower ballads.Berendt, Joachim, ‚ÄúSwing ‚Äì 1930.‚Äù In The Jazz Book, 58-61. St Albans: Paladin, 1976. In addition to Henderson and his younger brother Horace, Goodman employed top arrangers such as Fletcher Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, Deane Kincaide, Edgar Sampson, and Spud Murphy who put the melody first but included rhythmic figures in their charts and wrote arrangements that built to a logical climax. Mundy and Sampson had previously done arranging for Earl Hines and Chick Webb, respectively. In 1935, Goodman did not have many major soloists in his band. Unlike Duke Ellington, who went out of his way to hire unique individualists, and Count Basie, who came from a Kansas City tradition emphasizing soloists, Goodman was most concerned that his musicians read music perfectly, blended together naturally, and did not mind being subservient to the leader. It was the sound of the ensembles, the swinging rhythm section, and the leader‚Äôs fluent clarinet that proved to be irresistible to his young and eager listeners. =Arranging= To fit the new groove, dance-band arranging became more inventive. To some extent, this was a belated influence of Louis Armstrong, whose rhythms continued to be absorbed by soloists and arrangers through the 1930s. Arrangers learned to write elaborate lines for an entire section, harmonized in block chords, called soli. They were conversant with chromatic (complex) harmony and knew how to make the most of their flexible orchestra. Arrangements could also arise spontaneously out of oral practice. But even in New York, where bands prided themselves on their musical literacy, musicians could take improvised riffs and harmonize them on the spot. The result, known as a head arrangement, was a flexible, unwritten arrangement created by the entire band. One musician compared it to child‚Äôs play‚Äî‚Äúa lot of kids playing in the mud, having a big time.‚Äù Both kinds of arrangements, written and unwritten, could be heard in the hundreds of recordings made in the 1930s by Fletcher Henderson. For flashy pieces, Henderson relied on experienced arrangers, from his brother Horace to Don Redman and Benny Carter. But his biggest hits emerged from the bandstand. One was ‚ÄúSugar Foot Stomp,‚Äù derived in the early 1920s from the King Oliver tune ‚ÄúDippermouth Blues‚Äù and still in the repertory. By the 1930s, it had evolved into a thoroughly up-to-date dance tune, with a faster tempo to match the tastes of the dancers. Another hit was ‚ÄúKing Porter Stomp,‚ÄùGiddins, Gary and Scott DeVeaux. ‚ÄúThe Swing Era.‚Äù In Jazz, 174-77. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. a ragtime piece by Jelly Roll Morton that became radically simplified, shedding its two-beat clumsiness and march/ragtime form as it went. Many of these pieces were ultimately written down by Henderson, who became his band‚Äôs chief arranger. His genius for rhythmic swing and melodic simplicity was so effective that his music became the standard for numerous swing arrangers. Henderson was fond of short, memorable riffs‚Äîsimple, bluesy phrases‚Äîin call and response: saxophones responding to trumpets, for example. In some passages, he distorted the melody into ingenious new rhythmic shapes, often in staccato (detached) bursts that opened up space for the rhythm section. Henderson was shrewd and efficient. He wrote only a few choice choruses, leaving the remainder of the arrangement open for solos accompanied by discreet, long-held chords or short riffs. As each piece headed toward its climax, the band erupted in an ecstatic wail. Songs from the swing era The swing era produced many classic recordings.

A confidential channel is a way of transferring data that is resistant to overhearing (i.e., reading the content), but not necessarily resistant to tampering. An authentic channel is a way of transferring data that is resistant to tampering but not necessarily resistant to overhearing. Secure channels in the real world There are no perfectly secure channels in the real world. There are, at best, only ways to make insecure channels (e.g., couriers, homing pigeons, diplomatic bags, etc.) less insecure: padlocks (between courier wrists and a briefcase), loyalty tests, security investigations, and guns for courier personnel, diplomatic immunity for diplomatic bags, and so forth. In 1976, two researchers proposed a key exchange technique (now named after them)‚ÄîDiffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange (D-H). This protocol allows two parties to generate a key only known to them, under the assumption that a certain mathematical problem (e.g., the Diffie‚ÄìHellman problem in their proposal) is computationally infeasible (i.e., very very hard) to solve, and that the two parties have access to an authentic channel. In short, that an eavesdropper‚Äîconventionally termed 'Eve', who can listen to all messages exchanged by the two parties, but who can not modify the messages‚Äîwill not learn the exchanged key. Such a key exchange was impossible with any previously known cryptographic schemes based on symmetric ciphers, because with these schemes it is necessary that the two parties exchange a secret key at some prior time, hence they require a confidential channel at that time which is just what we are attempting to build. It is important to note that most cryptographic techniques are trivially breakable if keys are not exchanged securely or, if they actually were so exchanged, if those keys become known in some other way‚Äî burglary or extortion, for instance. An actually secure channel will not be required if an insecure channel can be used to securely exchange keys, and if burglary, bribery, or threat aren't used. The eternal problem has been and of course remains‚Äîeven with modern key exchange protocols‚Äîhow to know when an insecure channel worked securely (or alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, when it did not), and whether anyone has actually been bribed or threatened or simply lost a notebook (or a notebook computer) with key information in it. These are hard problems in the real world and no solutions are known‚Äîonly expedients, jury rigs, and workarounds. Future possibilities Researchers have proposed and demonstrated quantum cryptography in order to create a secure channel. If the current understanding of this subject of quantum physics is adequate, quantum cryptography facilitates the exchange of theoretically uneavesdroppable, non- interceptable, non-tamperable data. The mechanism is related to the uncertainty relation. It is not clear whether the special conditions under which it can be made to work are practical in the real world of noise, dirt, and imperfection in which most everything is required to function. Thus far, actual implementation of the technique is exquisitely finicky and expensive, limiting it to very special purpose applications. It may also be vulnerable to attacks specific to particular implementations and imperfections in the optical components of which the quantum cryptographic equipment is built. While implementations of classical cryptographic algorithms have received worldwide scrutiny over the years, only a limited amount of public research has been done to assess security of the present-day implementations of quantum cryptosystems, mostly because they are not in widespread use as of 2014. Modeling a secure channel Security definitions for a secure channel try to model its properties independently from its concrete instantiation. A good understanding of these properties is needed before designing a secure channel, and before being able to assess its appropriateness of employment in a cryptographic protocol. This is a topic of provable security. A definition of a secure channel that remains secure, even when used in arbitrary cryptographic protocols is an important building block for universally composable cryptography. A universally composable authenticated channel can be built using digital signatures and a public key infrastructure.Ran Canetti: Universally Composable Signatures, Certification, and Authentication.

Pharmacognosy is the study of plants or other natural sources as a possible source of drugs. The American Society of Pharmacognosy defines pharmacognosy as \\"the study of the physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological properties of drugs, drug substances, or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin as well as the search for new drugs from natural sources\\".The American Society of Pharmacognosy Description The word \\"pharmacognosy\\" is derived from two Greek words: œÜŒ¨œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ pharmakon (drug), and Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ gnosis (knowledge) or the Latin verb cognosco (con, 'with', and gn≈çsc≈ç, 'know'; itself a cognate of the Greek verb Œ≥Œπ(Œ≥)ŒΩœéœÉŒ∫œâ, gi(g)nœåsko, meaning 'I know, perceive'), meaning 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'. The term \\"pharmacognosy\\" was used for the first time by the Austrian physician Schmidt in 1811 and 1815 by Crr. Anotheus Seydler in work titled Analecta Pharmacognostica. Originally‚Äîduring the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century‚Äî\\"pharmacognosy\\" was used to define the branch of medicine or commodity sciences (Warenkunde in German) which deals with drugs in their crude, or unprepared, form. Crude drugs are the dried, unprepared material of plant, animal or mineral origin, used for medicine. The study of these materials under the name pharmakognosie was first developed in German-speaking areas of Europe, while other language areas often used the older term materia medica taken from the works of Galen and Dioscorides. In German the term drogenkunde (\\"science of crude drugs\\") is also used synonymously. As late as the beginning of the 20th century, the subject had developed mainly on the botanical side, being particularly concerned with the description and identification of drugs both in their whole state and in powder form. Such branches of pharmacognosy are still of fundamental importance, particularly for pharmacopoeial identification and quality control purposes, but rapid development in other areas has enormously expanded the subject. The advent of the 21st century brought a renaissance of pharmacognosy and its conventional botanical approach has been broadened up to molecular and metabolomic level. In addition to the previously mentioned definition, the American Society of Pharmacognosy also defines pharmacognosy as \\"the study of natural product molecules (typically secondary metabolites) that are useful for their medicinal, ecological, gustatory, or other functional properties.\\" Other definitions are more encompassing, drawing on a broad spectrum of biological subjects, including botany, ethnobotany, marine biology, microbiology, herbal medicine, chemistry, biotechnology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmaceutics, clinical pharmacy and pharmacy practice. * medical ethnobotany: the study of the traditional use of plants for medicinal purposes; *ethnopharmacology: the study of the pharmacological qualities of traditional medicinal substances; * the study of phytotherapy (the medicinal use of plant extracts); and *phytochemistry, the study of chemicals derived from plants (including the identification of new drug candidates derived from plant sources). *zoopharmacognosy, the process by which animals self-medicate, by selecting and using plants, soils, and insects to treat and prevent disease. *marine pharmacognosy, the study of chemicals derived from marine organisms. Biological background The carotenoids in primrose produce bright red, yellow and orange shades All plants produce chemical compounds as part of their normal metabolic activities. These phytochemicals are divided into (1) primary metabolites such as sugars and fats, which are found in all plants; and (2) secondary metabolites‚Äîcompounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving a more specific function. For example, some secondary metabolites are toxins used to deter predation and others are pheromones used to attract insects for pollination. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs‚Äîexamples are inulin from the roots of dahlias, quinine from the cinchona, THC and CBD from the flowers of cannabis, morphine and codeine from the poppy, and digoxin from the foxglove. Plants synthesize a variety of phytochemicals, but most are derivatives: *Alkaloids are a class of chemical compounds containing a nitrogen ring. Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and are part of the group of natural products (also called secondary metabolites). Many alkaloids can be purified from crude extracts by acid-base extraction. Many alkaloids are toxic to other organisms. *Polyphenols (also known as phenolics) are compounds that contain phenol rings. The anthocyanins that give grapes their purple color, the isoflavones, the phytoestrogens from soy and the tannins that give tea its astringency are phenolics. *Glycosides are molecules in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, usually a small organic molecule. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by enzyme hydrolysis, which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use. * Terpenes are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers, which are often strong smelling and thus may have had a protective function. They are the major components of resin, and of turpentine produced from resin. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as terpenoids. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. Essential oils are used widely as natural flavor additives for food, as fragrances in perfumery, and in traditional and alternative medicines such as aromatherapy. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives. The fragrance of rose and lavender is due to monoterpenes. The carotenoids produce the reds, yellows and oranges of pumpkin, corn and tomatoes. =Natural products chemistry= Digoxin is a purified cardiac glycoside that is extracted from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata. Digoxin is widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions. A typical protocol to isolate a pure chemical agent from natural origin is bioassay-guided fractionation, meaning step-by-step separation of extracted components based on differences in their physicochemical properties, and assessing the biological activity, followed by next round of separation and assaying. Typically, such work is initiated after a given crude drug formulation (typically prepared by solvent extraction of the natural material) is deemed \\"active\\" in a particular in vitro assay. If the end-goal of the work at hand is to identify which one(s) of the scores or hundreds of compounds are responsible for the observed in vitro activity, the path to that end is fairly straightforward: # fractionate the crude extract, e.g. by solvent partitioning or chromatography. # test the fractions thereby generated with in vitro assay. # repeat steps 1) and 2) until pure, active compounds are obtained. # determine structure(s) of active compound(s), typically by using spectroscopic methods. In vitro activity does not necessarily translate to activity in humans or other living systems. =Herbal= In some countries in Asia and Africa, 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine (including herbal medicine) for primary health care. Native American cultures have also relied on traditional medicine such as ceremonial smoking of tobacco, potlatch ceremonies, and herbalism, to name a few, prior to European colonization. Knowledge of traditional medicinal practices is disappearing, particularly in the Amazon.

Identity and population Slavs have lived in the area of Montenegro since the 6th and 7th centuries in the medieval state of Duklja. By the 14th century, the mountains behind the Gulf of Kotor were coming to be referred to as \\"Montenegro\\" (Montenegrin: Crna Gora; literally translates as ‚ÄúBlack Mountain‚Äù), and by the 15th century, the name was coming to increasingly replace the older name, Zeta. Since the end of the 17th century, Montenegro existed as a de facto independent country, first as a theocratic Prince- Bishopric (1694‚Äì1852), then as a secular Principality (1852‚Äì1910) and finally as a Kingdom (1910‚Äì1918). After the end of World War I, Montenegro was incorporated into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, thus losing its statehood. This led to a short-lived Christmas Uprising of 1919, between supporters of Petroviƒá-Njego≈° dynasty and Montenegrin statehood and proponents of unification with Serbia and Yugoslavia under the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. After the World War II, Montenegro regained its political sovereignty, becoming one of the six constituent republics of the SFR Yugoslavia, and Montenegro's sovereignty was recognised once again. A portion of Montenegrins declares as ethnic Serbs, while a larger proportion of citizens of Montenegro identifies ethnically as Montenegrin, a division that was exacerbated with the fall of socialism. This division has deepened further since the movement for full Montenegrin independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began to gain ground in 1991, while full independence was regained after the 2006 referendum. In the 2011 census, around 280,000 or 44.98% of the population of Montenegro identified themselves as ethnic Montenegrins, while around 180,000 or 28.73% identified themselves as Serbs. The number of \\"Montenegrins\\", \\"Serbs\\" and \\"Bosniaks\\" fluctuates from census to census, not due to real demographic changes, but due to changes in how people self-identify nationally. According to the Serbian 2011 census, there are 38,527 ethnic Montenegrins in Serbia, accounting for 0.54% of its population. In addition, a significant number of Serbs in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are of Montenegrin ancestry, but exact numbers are difficult to assess ‚Äì the inhabitants of Montenegro contributed greatly to the repopulation of a depopulated Serbia after two rebellions against the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. On 19 October 2007, Montenegro adopted a new Constitution which proclaimed Montenegrin (a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian) as the official language of Montenegro. The term \\"Montenegrins\\" in a wider sense can also be used to denote all residents of Montenegro, regardless of their national and religious affiliation. History =Middle Ages= Slavs settled in the Balkans during the 6th and 7th centuries. According to De Administrando Imperio, there existed three Slavic polities on the territory of modern Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and Principality of Serbia, the north. Duklja emerged as an independent state during the 11th century, initially held by the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty, later to be incorporated into the state of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. By forming the first country under the rule of ƒåaslav Klonimiroviƒá, with the centre in the old town of Ras, all these areas belong to Serbian territory by conquest. By strengthening of the coastal Duklja and the noble family of Vojislavljeviƒá, in the beginning of the 11th century, they took power from Vlastimirovic dynasty, and soon after that, in 1077, Prince Mihailo Vojislavljeviƒá got the crown from the Pope and proclaimed the Kingdom of Duklja, with the centre in the city of Bar. With the descent of Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty, nobleman Zavid Vukanoviƒá, from Ribnica near Podgorica, a cousin of Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty through a female line, gets four sons. His youngest son, Stefan Nemanja, will later become the Grand Prince of the new Great Serbia, and the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church among all Serbs. He moves to the city of Ras, where he overthrows (and kills) his eldest brother, Tihomir, in 1169, and declares himself the Grand Prince of Ra≈°ka. After his proclamation, the last Prince/King of Duklja, Mihailo Vojislavljeviƒá, dies, and Stefan Nemanja joins Duklja and Ra≈°ka, and soon he returns the rest of the lands from the period of Prince ƒåaslav Klonimiroviƒá and King Mihailo Vojislavljeviƒá. From the reign of Stefan Nemanja to the fall of the Montenegrin medieval state, Duklja, by this time called Zeta, was a part of the united Great Serbia. Throughout the period of Nemanjiƒá dynasty, Crnojeviƒá dynasty became a noble family, and later on the line of Crnojeviƒá was replaced by the family of Bal≈°iƒái, believed to be originating from France, who remain on the throne of the Zeta, by then known as Montenegro, until the fall of the Serbian state in 1459. The region previously known as Duklja later became known as \\"Zeta\\". Between 1276 and 1309, Serbian queen Helen of Anjou, the widow of the Serbian King Stefan Uro≈° I, ruled Zeta, where she built and restored several monasteries, most notably the Monastery of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Srƒë and Vakh) on the Bojana river below Skadar (Shkod√´r). The Venetian name Montenegro, meaning \\"black mountain\\" occurred for the first time in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina, dating to 1296, during Jelena's reign. Under King Stefan Milutin (reigned 1282-1321), at the beginning of the 14th century, the Archdiocese in Bar was the biggest feudal domain in Zeta. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Bal≈°iƒá noble family, then the Crnojeviƒá noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora (Venetian: '). In 1496, the Ottomans conquered Zeta and subsequently established a sanjak that was subordinated to the Sanjak of Scutari. Ottoman influence remained largely limited to urban areas, while various tribes in the highlands emerged as districts out of reach of the Ottomans. These tribes were at times united against the Ottomans, under the leadership of the Metropolitans of Montenegro, the so-called \\"prince-bishops\\". =19th century= Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° With the arrival of the Turks, because of the inaccessibility of the terrain, and because of the lack of interest of the Ottomans for the \\"Montenegrin karst and fracture\\"(inaccessible terrain), the tribes in Montenegro enjoyed more than autonomy, and less than independence, but even this did not prevent the Montenegrin tribes from raising various revolts against Turkish conquest . The people were divided into tribes, and shortly thereafter bloody accounts of \\"brotherly\\" tribes turned bloody. The most serious causes of these accidents were the lack of food in the then-Montenegro, and the few resources were left, were taken away by the Turks, and the conflicts were inevitable. At the beginning of the 18th century. From then on, to Prince Danilo Petrovic, Montenegrins are under the theocratic rule of the Petroviƒá dynasty. Due to the impossibility of approach, due to the terrain of Montenegro, Bishop Petar I Petroviƒá Njego≈° cursed the tribes he was ruling, using their piety to inspire unity, and thus attempted to prevent the further slaughter of the fraternal people. After his death in 1830, Petar of Cetinje was buried in Cetinje Monastery and was proclaimed a saint. Flag of Principality of Montenegro His adopted son Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° ruled from 1830 until 1851. It is recorded as one of the greatest educators of the Serbian people in general. He wrote one of the most important works of the romantic epoch \\"Mountain Wreath\\" (regarded as one of the artistic foundations of Serbian nationalism), and he was also credited with bringing the final look of a Montenegrin hat, which is decorated with a black frame and represents the crown, more precisely, sorrow for the slavery of the Serbian people under Ottoman yoke. The top of the cap is red, symbolising blood, where 5 golden threads are engraved, thought to signify 5 centuries of slavery under the Turks. Within these golden threads there is a \\"Cross\\" with four Cyrillic letters (scores) S, a variant of the Byzantine Palaiologos tetragrammic cross, sometimes referred to as the variant of the Serbian cross. Flag of the Kingdom of Montenegro He ruled as a Bishop, but he also stood firm to see that Montenegro must be modernised. He built schools, roads, raised the Church, expanded the capital of Cetinje. After his death and funeral, he was succeeded by his nephew Prince Danilo Petroviƒá who ruled as the first secular ruler, with the title of Knjaz. Since then, Knja≈æevina (Principality) of Montenegro was no longer a Prince-Bishopric, but a secular monarchy. This led to the opinion of the Turkish court that this change can lead to a major change in Montenegro, and a desire for \\"independence\\". In 1852, Omer-pasha sent a large army against the Montenegrins. A small Montenegrin army led by Prince Danilo's brother, Duke (Vojvoda) Mirko, defended 30 remaining fighters in the monastery of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Ostrog for 9 days. This is taken as the greatest heroic force of the people in those areas. One year later, Omer-pasha again tried to conquer Montenegro, but with the great heroism of Vojvoda Mirko, the Montenegrins performed the greatest victory over the Ottomans in the new century, after which Montenegro gained essential autonomy, the highest degree to independence, and a few decades later, full independence. Prince Danilo dies in 1860, and Danilo's adoptive son came to the throne, biological son of Vojvoda Mirko, Nikola Petroviƒá. He remained remembered in Montenegro as the greatest ruler, owing in large part to the fact that he was the first modern- day King of Montenegro and that it was under him that Montenegro's independence had been recognised. He is of great importance for the Montenegrin people in general, because he has fought against the Ottomans in the territory of Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia, and the people often called him \\"Emperor of the Heroes\\". Immediately after coming to power, a war for the liberation of the Montenegrin people in Herzegovina started in 1862, in which Principality of Montenegro entered, but later it turned out that she entered extremely unprepared and soon after that peace was made. After returning from Russia, the then emperor Alexander II enlightened him, and immediately upon his arrival he began to work hard for the urbanisation of the country. He revised the army completely, built many courts and schools, and Montenegro began to look like a European state. In 1876, with the Principality of Serbia and the Obrenoviƒá dynasty, he started a war, in history known as \\"War for the Liberation of the Serbian People\\". A couple of years before the war, Prince Nikola Petroviƒá with the Serbian prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá made an alliance in Venice, where beside the military alliance, a contract was signed on the dynastic heritage of the new future unified joint state. It was said that the plan is for Serbia to go back to its historical borders (On the management of the Empire) from the Timok River to the Una peak. The Montenegrin federal unit would be an integral part of the new common state, and in it Petroviƒá dynasty would have the title of the princes, while the Obrenoviƒá dynasty would wear a royal crown. The Montenegrins performed great victories, and by the end of the war at the Berlin Congress in 1878, the Principality of Montenegro received recognized independence, and became an internationally recognized state. This act raised the then two Serbian states to the ranks of independence, and it meant encouragement for all Serbs to completely resist the Turkish occupation in all Serbian countries. After the war, Prince Nikola wrote all his famous works, and the most famous work is the folk anthem \\"Onamo' namo! \\", According to many, the most beautiful Serbian song about Kosovo. In 1910, then Prince Nikola, with the permission of the great powers of the Kingdom of Serbia and King Peter, proclaimed another Serbian kingdom in the Balkans: the Kingdom of Montenegro. The flag of the new state has become a flagrant national flag (a Serbian tricolor with the coat of arms of Petroviƒá-Njegos dynasty), while with the old flag, it is equally used in the people and the popular \\"crusader\\" flag of Montenegrins. Knjazevina (Principality) of Montenegro, with the address of Russia, announces the war on Japan. Naturally, the participation of Montenegrins in this war was more symbolic, as the gratitude of Montenegro to Russia for generous help. In the Balkan Wars, the Kingdom of Montenegro and the Kingdom of Serbia participated in the liberation battles in the old Serbia (Kosovo, Metohija, and Ra≈°ka) and Macedonia. Thus, a common border was established between the two new-age \\"Serb\\" states, and the dream of King Nikola about the liberation of the \\"Serbian cradle\\" (Kosovo) was realised. At the beginning of the First World War, Montenegro immediately declared war on Austria-Hungary, after Serbia, but in 1916 it had to capitulate after all forces held a rally on the direction of Serbian withdrawal through Albania. After the passage of the Serbian government and the king, the crushed Montenegrin army sacrificed itself for the future of the Serbian state. King Nikola, already ill and in his late years, left his homeland. He went to France, where he died. The Montenegrins maintained their de-facto independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman's reign over most of the Balkan region (Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.). The Montenegrins were gathered around the Metropolitans of the Cetinje Metropolitanate, which led to further national awakening of the Montenegrins all around. The creation of a theocratic state and its advancement into a secular and independent country was even more evident in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The rule of the House of Petroviƒá in the 18th and 19th century unified the Montenegrins and established strong ties with Russia and later with Serbia (under Ottoman occupation), with occasional help from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. That period was marked by numerous battles with Ottoman conquerors as well as by a firmer establishment of a self-governed principality. In 1878, the Congress of Berlin recognised Montenegro as the 26th independent state in the world. Montenegro participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, as well as in World War I on the side of the Allies. =Yugoslav era= After the liberation of the Serbian and other Yugoslav (South Slavic) peoples, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was proclaimed, but the \\"Venetian Agreement\\" between the then Prince Nikola and Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá was breached. With the unification with the Kingdom of Serbia, Montenegro was to have autonomy under the prince's dynasty Petroviƒá-Njego≈°. Due to this act, the Montenegrin public was divided on two sides. The first, majority party, better known as Bjela≈°i (\\"The Whites\\"), advocated unconditional unification with the Serbian Kingdom under the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty, while Zelena≈°i (\\"The Greens\\"), in a minority, advocated a conditional union that would respect the Venice Treaty. In Podgorica on October 26, 1918, the Podgorica Assembly unanimously voted that Montenegro unconditionally unites with Serbia into Yugoslavia, without any autonomy. Due to this decision, the few Greens are persecuted, and their rebellion is suppressed in the coming years. In 1929, with the proclamation of the Zeta Banovina with its headquarters in Podgorica, the territory of the former Montenegro with eastern Herzegovina and Metohija gained autonomy in the form of banovina (province), and the ruler of the region became a ban, whom the king personally appoints. King Aleksandar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá ordered the construction of a chapel in Lovƒáen in 1925, and the remains of, as many would say, \\"the wisest Serb\\" Prince-Bishop Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° were transferred there in a grandiose ceremony. At the beginning of the Second World War, the army in the Zeta Banovina area made great success against the Italian occupation of the army, expelling the Italian army to Shkodra in Albania. After the breakup of the Yugoslav state, Montenegro gets a puppet government led by Sekula Drljeviƒá, who will be expelled from the country later. Montenegro unconditionally joined Serbia on November 26, 1918 in a controversial decision of the Podgorica Assembly, and soon afterwards became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia. A number of Montenegrin chieftains, disappointed by the effective disappearance of Montenegro, which they perceived to have resulted from political manipulation, rose up in arms during January 1919 in an uprising known as the Christmas Rebellion, which was crushed in a severe, comprehensive military campaign by 1922‚Äì23. Annexation of the Kingdom of Montenegro on November 13, 1918 gained international recognition only at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, held on July 13, 1922. In 1929 the newly renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia was reorganised into provinces (banovine) one of which, Zeta Banovina, encompassed the old Kingdom of Montenegro and had Cetinje as its administrative centre. Between the two world wars, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia opposed the Yugoslav monarchy and its unification policy, and supported Montenegrin autonomy, gaining considerable support in Montenegro. During World War II, many Montenegrins joined the Yugoslav partisan forces, although the portion joining the chetniks was also significant. One third of all officers in the partisan army were Montenegrins. They also gave a disproportionate number of highest-ranked party officials and generals. During WWII Italy occupied Montenegro (in 1941) and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy the area of Kotor, where there was a small Roman community (descendants from the populations of the renaissance-era Albania Veneta). When the second Yugoslavia was formed in 1945, the Communists who led the Partisans during the war formed the new r√©gime. They recognised, sanctioned, and fostered a national identity of Montenegrins as a people distinct from the Serbs and other South Slavs. The number of people who were registered as Montenegrins in Montenegro was 90% in 1948; it had been dropping since, to 62% in 1991. With the rise of Serbian nationalism in the late 80's the number of citizens who declared themselves Montenegrin dropped sharply from 61.7%, in the 1991 census, to 43.16% in 2003. For a detailed overview of these trends, see the Demographic history of Montenegro. The Yugoslav state recognised Montenegrins as a separate nation, different from Serbs and other Slavs, and gave them their own statistical code at the 1948 population census, where about 90% of Montenegrin citizens declared themselves Montenegrin. Initially, after the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, the idea of a distinct Montenegrin ethnic identity had been taken over by independence-minded Montenegrins. The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) (rebranded Communist Party), led by Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá and President Momir Bulatoviƒá, was firmly allied with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá throughout this period and opposed such movements. During the Bosnian War and Croatian War (1991‚Äì1995) Montenegro participated with its police and paramilitary forces in the attacks on Dubrovnik and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops. It conducted persecutions against Bosniak refugees who were arrested by the Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foƒça, where they were executed. =Seeking independence= At the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis in the 1990s, the JNA army was trying to prevent the break up of Yugoslavia by military attacks. Part of the army from the then SR of Montenegro is attacking Herzegovina and Dubrovnik, and keeps Dubrovnik under siege for almost eight months. In this period, the Montenegrins have an old sense of national affiliation, and at a referendum almost 100% of the respondents who voted on the referendum declare that they want to stay in the new state the neighbourhood of Serbia and Montenegro, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the siege of Dubrovnik, the Serbian (Montenegrin) paramilitary formation invents the saying: \\"From Lovƒáen a fairy salutes, where are you Serbian Dubrovnik!\\" (Serbian: \\"–°–∞ –õ–æ–≤—õ–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–∏–ª–∞ –∫–ª–∏—á–µ, —í–µ —Å–∏ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ –î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏—á–µ!\\"), which has been taken many times as a verse with a negative connotation, because of the city being besieged for so much time. After the abolition of communism and the creation of a new state, the federal unit of the Republic of Montenegro receives a new flag and the coat-of-arms, where the flag was a classic Montenegrin national flag (a Serbian tricolour with blue colour), while the coat of arms of the Coat of Arms is taken from the historical emblem of Petroviƒá. Then, the great fighters for the joint FRY, Momir Bulatoviƒá and Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, together with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, rule the state union. The paths of Milo ƒêukanoviƒá and Momir Bulatoviƒá diverge before the start of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and Milo ƒêukanoviƒá begins to change attitudes drastically, starting first with the political attitudes and afterwards the national and religious. In 1997 a full-blown rift occurred within DPS, and ƒêukanoviƒá's faction won over Bulatoviƒá's, who formed a new Socialist People's Party of Montenegro (SNP). The DPS distanced itself from Milo≈°eviƒá and gradually took over the independence idea from the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro and the SDP, and has won all elections since. In the fall of 1999, shortly after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the ƒêukanoviƒá-led Montenegrin leadership came out with a platform for the re-definition of relations within the federation that called for more Montenegrin involvement in the areas of defence and foreign policy, though the platform fell short of pushing for independence. After Milo≈°eviƒá's overthrow on October 5, 2000, ƒêukanoviƒá for the first time came out in support of full independence. Montenegro started increasingly moving away from Serbia, and in 2003, the Parliament of Montenegro sought amendments to the Constitution. With these amendments, and the Federal Unit of Montenegro was allowed to call a referendum on independence, which took place on 21 May 2006. When the referendum was announced, independence was obtained by a narrow majority. However, the bar was set high in order to avoid any dispute after the vote, with the requirement for a 55% of votes in favour of independence. Since the proclamation of independence, the policy of making a new ethnic identity is even more intensified by official Montenegro, often used for political purposes, whereas the citizens still remain divided on the issue of ethnic identity. Language Montenegrins speak Montenegrin, an Ijekavian variant of the Shtokavian dialect of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language. Neo- shtokavian Eastern-Herzegovinian sub-dialect is spoken in the North-West (largest city Nik≈°iƒá), and old shtokavian Zeta sub-dialect is spoken in the rest of Montenegro, including capital Podgorica and the Old Royal Capital of Cetinje, and eastern Sanjak. The Zeta dialect features additional sounds: a voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative (), voiced alveolo-palatal fricative *(, (occurring in other jekavian dialects as well) and a voiced alveolar affricate (, shared with other old-≈°tokavian dialects). Both sub-dialects are characterised by highly specific accents (shared with other old-≈°tokavian dialects) and several \\"hyper-ijekavisms\\" (i.e. nijesam, where the rest of shtokavian area uses nisam) and \\"hyper-iotations\\" (ƒëevojka for djevojka, ƒëeca for djeca etc.) (these features, especially the hyper-iotation, are more prominent in the Zeta sub-dialect), that are common in all Montenegrin vernaculars. On the sociolinguistic level, the language has been classified as a dialect of Serbo-Croat. The Montenegrin constitution currently defines Montenegrin as the official language. Since the campaign for independence, a movement for recognition of the Montenegrin language as wholly separate from Serbian and other standard variants of Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, Croatian) has emerged, finding the basis for separate language identity mostly in the above- mentioned dialectal specifics. In the 2011 census, 42.88% of Montenegrin citizens stated that they speak the Serbian language, while 36.97% stated that they speak Montenegrin. Most of the young people under 18 in Montenegro, 39.23 percent, say they speak Montenegrin, while 37.47% call their mother tongue Serbian, as shown in the census held from 1 to 15 April 2011. Religion Most Montenegrins are Serbian Orthodox, predominantly belonging to the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral of the Serbian Orthodox Church as well as its four other eparchies (dioceses) that are active in parts of Montenegro and neighbouring countries, namely the Eparchy of Budimlja and Nik≈°iƒá, the Eparchy of Mile≈°eva, and the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina. A minority are adherents of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which is not canonically recognised by the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the census of 2011, people that declared Montenegrin as their ethnicity declared the following religious identity: *Eastern Orthodox: 248,523 (88.7%) *Islam: 12,931 (4.6%) *Catholic: 5,667 (2.0%) *Protestantism: 921 (0.3%) *Atheism/Agnosticism: 6,393 (2.3%) *Others: 5,883 (2.1%) Culture thumb The most important dimension of Montenegrins' culture is the ethical ideal of ƒåojstvo i juna≈°tvo, roughly translated as \\"Chivalry and Bravery\\". Another result of its centuries-long warrior history, is the unwritten code of Chivalry that Marko Miljanov, one of the most famous warriors in his time, tried to describe in his book Primjeri ƒçojstva i juna≈°tva (Examples of Humanity and Bravery) at the end of 19th century. Its main principles stipulate that to deserve a true respect of its people, a warrior has to show virtues of integrity, dignity, humility, self-sacrifice for the just cause if necessary, respect for others, and Rectitude, along with the bravery. In the old days of battle, it resulted in Montenegrins fighting to the death, since being captured was considered the greatest shame. Miljanov defined the two characteristics in a maxim roughly translated as: \\"Bravery is when I defend myself from the other, chivalry is when I defend the other from myself\\" (\\"Juna≈°tvo je kada sebe branim od drugoga, ƒçojstvo je kada drugoga branim od sebe\\"). This ethos is still an important part of most Montenegrins' ethical belief system, and understanding it is essential in order to understand Montenegrin identity and self-perception. Most of extraordinary examples of Montenegrin conduct during its long history can be traced to the code. Montenegrins' long-standing history of fighting for independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of folk epic poetry. A prominent feature of Montenegrin culture is the gusle, a one-stringed instrument played by a story- teller who sings or recites stories of heroes and battles in decasyllabic verse. These traditions are stronger in the northern parts of the country and are also shared with people in eastern Herzegovina, western Serbia, northern Albania, and central Dalmatia. On the substratum of folk epic poetry, poets like Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈°, widely considered the most one of the most brilliant Montenegrins and Southern Slavs in history, have created their own expression. Njego≈°'s epic book Gorski Vijenac (The Mountain Wreath) presents the central point of Montenegrin culture as struggle for freedom. On the other hand, Adriatic cities like Herceg-Novi, Kotor, and Budva had strong trading and maritime traditions, and were more open for Venetian, Ragusan, and other Catholic influences. Possession of those cities often changed, but their population was basically a mixture of people with Orthodox and Catholic religions and traditions. These cities were incorporated into Montenegro only after the fall of Austria-Hungary. In those cities, stronger influences of medieval and renaissance architecture, painting, and lyric poetry can be found, and while the adherence to the principles of chivalry and bravery are part of their ethos they are usually less central than in the areas of \\"old Montenegro\\". Anthropology Vlahoviƒá (2008) noted many anthropological studies which showed that Montenegrin people have strong Dinaric type (with seaboard, central, Durmitor, mountain and other subtypes) autochthonous on the Dinaric Alps since the Mesolithic period. Dinaric peoples, including Montenegrins, are among the tallest people in the world. The type, particularly in Montenegro, is distinguished by brachiochepal shape, broad forehead, wide relief and strong face, wide jaw and noticeably flat notched head, while arms and legs are proportional to the body height. Hair is commonly of black color, with black or blue eyes. Anthropologist Bo≈æina Ivanoviƒá considered that the development of the Montenegrin Dinaric variety was influenced by gracilisation and brachycephalisation; they have characteristics which were not found in other Slavic and non-Slavic European populations, nor morphological properties from paleo-anthropological series originating from the Slavic necropolis from other South Slavic area. Also, the brachycephalisation and width of the face in the last five centuries is growing in Montenegrin, while among other Slavic and European communities decreasing, showing anthropological issues in Montenegro have deeper roots and broader scientific importance. Montenegrin historian Dragoje ≈Ωivkoviƒá (1989) noted that modern multidisciplinary research disagrees with older consideration how Sklavinias and Slavic states had ethnical identification, example Serb ethnos, until 12th century. Slavs mixing with native population (in case of Komani culture necropolis in Puk√´) made a new cultural-historical drift of Albanian-Illyrian and Slavic built upon extinct and present La T√®ne, Greek-Illyrian, Illyrian-Roman, and Byzantine. He argued that the Slavs from Duklja promptly blended in social-economical of the natives who historically had a more developed society, as was in their interest to approach the Roman- Illyrian natives. Genetic studies done in 2010 on 404 male individuals from Montenegro gave the following results: haplogroups I2a (Mesolithic) and E-V13 (Neolithic) make 60%, J2 (Neolithic) 9%, R1b 9.5%, while R1a accounted for 7.5%, with all others less than 5% each.

If the team which finishes top of the division has good enough ground facilities, traditionally it was promoted to the Welsh Football League Division One and is replaced by the team finishing bottom of Division One. The team finishing in bottom position is relegated to the Welsh Football League Division Three. For the 2019‚Äì20 season promotion was to the newly formed Ardal Leagues at Tier 3 and relegation was to one of the regional leagues. From its inception in 1904 it always sat below the top flight of the Welsh League, or the Rhymney Valley League and Glamorgan League as it was known until 1912. This division has changed its title on numerous occasions to follow suit of the other leagues within the competition; for seven years in the 1980s it was known as the Premier Division as the top flight adopted the National Division name, while Division Two was split into two sections - A & B and West & East - for many years before 1965. In 1992 it became level three of the Welsh Football Pyramid following the creation of the Welsh Premier League. After the creation of the Cymru South, for the 2019‚Äì20 season, the league was rebranded and Welsh Football League Division Two incorporated the former Division Three teams.

Following these changes, a Tier 3, Division Two was created. operated under the Division Two title'' From 1983-84 season, the Premier Division changed its name to the National Division and the First Division adopted the Premier Division With these changes the third tier Division Two was renamed 'Division One' With the creation of the League of Wales for the 1992‚Äì93 season, the Welsh Football League moved to levels two, three and four of the Welsh football pyramid, and adopted the titles of Division One, Division Two and Division Three respectively. After the creation of the Cymru South, for the 2019‚Äì20 season, the league was rebranded as the Welsh Football League Division Two and Division Three was defunct.

It also promoted women's rights, an issue that split the American abolitionist movement. Despite its modest circulation of 3,000, it had prominent and influential readers, including Frederick Douglass and Beriah Green. It frequently printed or reprinted letters, reports, sermons, and news stories relating to American slavery, becoming a sort of community bulletin board for the new abolitionist movement that Garrison helped foster.  History  An issue of The Liberator depicting African Americans next to a lynching tree. Garrison co-published weekly issues of The Liberator from Boston continuously for 35 years, from January 1, 1831, to the final issue of December 29, 1865. Although its circulation was only about 3,000, and three- quarters of subscribers (in 1834) were African Americans,Ripley, C. Peter (1991). The Black Abolitionist Papers: Vol. III: The United States, 1830‚Äì1846, p. 9. UNC Press. . the newspaper earned nationwide notoriety for its uncompromising advocacy of \\"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves\\" in the United States. Garrison set the tone for the paper in his famous open letter \\"To the Public\\" in the first issue: Fundraising appeal of William Garrison, 1834. Rather than looking to politics to create change, Garrison utilized nonviolent means, such as moral suasion, as his message throughout the newspaper. Garrison felt that slavery was a moral issue and used his way of writing to appeal to the morality of his readers as an attempt to influence them into changing their morally questionable ways. For example, \\"No Union with Slave-Holders\\" was a slogan utilized for weeks at a time throughout the newspaper's publication, advocating that the North should leave the Union.Garrison celebrates 13th amendment William Lloyd Garrison. The Liberator continued for three decades from its founding through the end of the American Civil War. It had black columnists and reporters. Garrison ended the newspaper's run with a valedictory column at the end of 1865, when the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery throughout the United States. It was succeeded by The Nation.The Anti-Slavery Reporter, August 1, 1865, p. 187. Women's rights advocacy The Liberator also became an avowed women's rights newspaper when the prospectus for its 1838 issue declared that as the paper's objective was \\"to redeem woman as well as man from a servile to an equal condition,\\" it would support \\"the rights of woman to their utmost extent.\\"Liberator, December 15, 1837. In January and February 1838, the Liberator published Sarah Grimk√©'s \\"Letters on the Province of Woman\\", and later that year published them as a book, using the reprint to call attention to another of Garrison and Knapp's projects, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. During the following decades, the Liberator promoted women's rights by publishing editorials, petitions, convention calls and proceedings, speeches, legislative action, and other material advocating women's suffrage, equal property rights, and women's educational and professional equality. The Liberators printers, Isaac Knapp, James Brown Yerrinton (1800‚Äì1866) and James Manning Winchell Yerrinton (1825‚Äì1893), and Robert Folger Wallcut (1797‚Äì1884), printed many of the women's rights tracts of the 1850s.  Inspiration among abolitionists  1850 Liberator masthead, designed by Hammatt Billings The Liberator inspired abolitionist Angelina Grimk√© to publicly join the abolitionist movement. She sent a letter to William Lloyd Garrison recalling her experiences as a member of an upper class, white, slaveholding family. Angelina Grimk√©'s letter to William Lloyd Garrison was soon after published in The Liberator.https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti- slavery/essays/angelina-and-sarah-grimke-abolitionist-sisters Frederick Douglass was inspired by The Liberator. As he commented upon in his first issue of The North Star, Frederick Douglass felt that it was necessary for African-Americans, such as himself, to speak out about their own experiences with injustice. He claimed that those that experienced injustice were the ones that must demand justice. Soon after, Douglass began writing his own abolitionist newspaper, The North Star.  Resistance  The Liberator faced harsh resistance from several state legislatures and local groups: for example, North Carolina indicted Garrison for felonious acts, and the Vigilance Association of Columbia, South Carolina, offered a reward of $1,500 () to those who identified distributors of the paper. Garrison also faced resistance, even to the point of violence. In 1835, a Boston mob formed with support from local newspapers in resistance to the announcement that George Thompson would speak at the first anniversary meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. The mob, unable to find Thompson, redirected their aggression towards Garrison who was in the society's meeting hall. Eventually escalation of the situation led to destruction of the society's antislavery sign, and even calls to lynch Garrison, around whose neck a piece of rope made into a noose was put (to frighten him). Garrison eventually managed a narrow escape; the mayor put him in the city jail for his protection.

It produces beer under the Pyramid brand at two breweries and several brewpubs in Washington, Oregon, and California. It was founded in 1984 as Hart Brewing, and is currently owned by North American Breweries, a subsidiary of the Costa Rican company Florida Ice & Farm Co. History Hart Brewing was founded by Tom Baune and Beth Hartwell in 1984 in Kalama, Washington. A pioneer of craft brewing in the Pacific Northwest, Hart's signature beer was Pyramid Pale Ale, which it followed with Pyramid Wheaten Ale in 1985. In 1994, Hart debuted the Apricot Ale, a fruit beer that quickly became its most prominent brand. The company opened new facilities and greatly expanded its production, and changed its name to Pyramid Breweries in 1996. It also started experimenting with other styles, which won a number of brewing competitions in the U.S. and abroad. Eventually it grew to become one of the five largest craft brewers in the country. Pyramid eventually stopped brewing in Kalama in favor of other locations, but maintained its headquarters in Seattle. In 2004, Pyramid acquired Portland Brewing Company, makers of the MacTarnahan's brand. In 2008, the company was itself purchased by Independent Brewers United, the parent company of Magic Hat Brewing Company of Burlington, Vermont. Magic Hat maintained the Seattle office and the Pyramid and MacTarnahan's facilities and products.Pyramid Breweries to be acquired by Magic Hat Two years later, the joint company was acquired by North American Breweries of Rochester, New York.Rochester, North American buys Magic Hat, Pyramid and MacTarnahan's In December 2012, the parent company was purchased by Cerveceria Costa Rica, a unit of the Costa Rican company Florida Ice & Farm Co. Pyramid's Snow Cap Winter Ale reached number one on the list of the top 100 beers by Cold Cans podcast. Beers Pyramid once featured beers including, ales, lager, weizens, ciders, porters, and IPAs. Nowadays, Pyramid offers six year-round beers, including Hefeweizen, Apricot Ale, Thunderhead IPA and Outburst Imperial IPA. Pyramid also offers seasonal beers, including Curve Ball Blonde Ale, Oktoberfest and Snow Cap Winter Warmer, along with seasonal variety packs and limited release beers.

Impiety is often closely associated with sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a cult, as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to Christianity was that, unlike other mystery religions, early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than solely religious (as religions were tied into the state). It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods. Ancient Greece The issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources. A number of Athenian men, including Alcibiades, were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution (Andocides was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events). Most famously, the philosopher Socrates was executed for impiety (as well as corrupting Athenian youth) in 399 BC. An Athenian philosopher Anaxagoras taught that the sun and the stars were fiery stones whose heat we did not feel because of their distance, and was allegedly accused of impiety in Athens. Diagoras of Melos was reportedly accused of atheism and had to flee Athens after being charged with impiety for revealing the content of the Eleusinian mysteries to the uninitiated. Philosophers Aristotle and Theophrastus might have been accused of impiety as well. Phryne was put on trial for impiety and was defended by the orator Hypereides; she was acquitted.

During the Wars of Religion, this included moderates of both religious faiths (Huguenots and Catholics) who held that only the restoration of a strong monarchy could save France from total collapse, as rulers would often overlook religious differences in order to have a strong country. References to individuals as politique often had a pejorative connotation of moral or religious indifference. The concept gained great currency after 1568 with the appearance of the radical Catholic League calling for the eradication of Protestantism in France, and by 1588 the politiques were seen by detractors as an organized group and treated as worse than heretics. History In early critical writings, the politiques (largely jurists and intellectuals) were sometimes confused with another group, the \\"malcontents\\" (nobles who opposed the political influence of the Guise family). This was mainly because the first record of politiques referred to those Catholics and Huguenots who opposed the founding of a Guise dynasty in France. They rallied against the Guise because King Philip II of Spain openly supported the Duke of Guise. Because the King of Spain was an enemy of France, many felt uncomfortable with a king hand-picked by the Spanish. Instead, they rallied for peace and unity in France. Many moderate politique Catholics defended the idea of Gallicanism, of making a distinction between the State and Religion, of a unitary and undivided royal sovereignty (against exterior influence or internal divisions), and of privileging national security and peace. It can be argued that anyone who believed in the necessity of a strong monarchy to national security was a politique. For example, the politique policies of Henry IV of France, such as the Edict of Nantes (a document granting unprecedented political and religious liberties to the minority French Protestants), directly contributed to the centralized administrative system of seventeenth century France and the absolutism embodied by Louis XIV of France, which included an eventual revocation of the Edict. Another example of a politique was Elizabeth I of England, who was (or claimed to be) a Catholic during the time of her sister Mary I but moved to Protestantism when attaining the throne. The later monarch Charles II - long flirting with Catholicism and holding out a promise to convert to it as a means of getting support from Louis XIV of France, but only actually converting on his deathbed - could also be considered to have acted as a Politique, though by his time the term was less often used. Jonathan I. Israel emphasizes the important role played by various \\"Politiques\\" in the Dutch Revolt of the 16th Century and the 17th Century Dutch Republic created by that revolt. Specifically, he notes as the most important of them William the Silent, who moved from the Catholic Church to the Calvinist one - the opposite direction to that taken by his contemporary Henry IV of France, but taken out of similar motives. In Jonathan Israel's view, the long-term influence of such Dutch Politiques was positive, helping to mitigate the more intransigent forms of Calvinism and to create in the Netherlands a climate of (relative) religious toleration, greater than in other European countries at the time.Jonathan I. Israel. \\"The Dutch Republic\\", Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995. Likewise, Blair Worden makes the point that during the Commonwealth of England, while the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was broadly Calvinist, his circle contained non-sectarian ‚Äòmerciful men‚Äô or politiques who were more tolerant of other doctrines.Worden, Blair (2012).

Events =Arsenal cruise to title glory= In what had earlier been one of the most closely fought Premiership title races for years, Arsenal won the championship by a seven-point margin. Their crown was won in the penultimate game of the season when they beat defending champions Manchester United 1‚Äì0 at Old Trafford. Four days earlier, they had also won the FA Cup with a 2‚Äì0 victory over Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. Their top scorer, Thierry Henry, was on target 24 times in the league alone. One downside to the season was Arsenal's failure to progress to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League. =Sir Alex puts off his retirement= Sir Alex Ferguson announced in February that he would be postponing his retirement as Manchester United manager by at least three more seasons after he signed a new contract as manager. The news came just after United completed an impressive revival in the Premiership which saw them rise from ninth to first in the space of two months. On 8 December, United stood ninth in the Premiership ‚Äì 11 points behind Liverpool, who had a game in hand ‚Äì and had lost five of their seven previous games in the aftermath of a 1‚Äì0 defeat at home to West Ham United. Even a UEFA Cup place appeared beyond reach. An eight-match winning run, however, saw United cruise to the top of the Premiership and they were soon challenging a three-horse race with Liverpool and Arsenal. They remained in the title race until the penultimate game of the season, when they lost 1‚Äì0 at home to Arsenal and surrendered the title crown to their opponents. United's failure was largely put down to the inability to find a suitable replacement for Jaap Stam, the Dutch central defender who had been sold to Lazio for ¬£16.25 million just after the start of the season. Another disappointment was the failure of Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n, at ¬£28.1 million the most expensive player ever to sign for an English club, to never live up to his hefty price tag. On a positive note, Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy lived up to his ¬£19 million price tag by scoring 34 goals in all competitions during his first season at Old Trafford, breaking the club record that had been set by Dennis Viollet 40 seasons earlier. After the season concluded, rumours began to circulate that Ferguson was about to break the English transfer record once again and sign Leeds United central-back Rio Ferdinand in the hope that his side would return to their winning ways in 2002‚Äì03. =Ipswich fall from grace= A year after qualifying for the UEFA Cup and earning George Burley the Manager of the Year award, Ipswich Town dropped back into Division One. The Suffolk side had looked doomed by Christmas after winning just one of their first 18 Premiership games. Then came a turnaround in form which saw them win seven out of eight fixtures and climb to 12th place, suggesting that they were safe. But another decline set in, and this time Ipswich were unable to halt it. Their relegation was confirmed with a 5‚Äì0 defeat away to runners- up Liverpool on the final day of the season. Joining Ipswich in Division One would be already doomed Derby County and Leicester City, both going down after six seasons in the Premiership, the last of which had seen three different men take charge of the team. =West Brom and Birmingham back in the big time= West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City, who had last played in the top flight in 1985‚Äì86, were finally promoted back to the top division with Albion as Division One runners-up and Birmingham as playoff winners. In an ironic twist, Albion had overtaken another local rival in Wolverhampton Wanderers, which had been out of the top flight even longer, in the race for the run for second place by winning seven of their final nine league games. Birmingham's triumph was sealed by a penalty-shoot out win over Norwich at the Millennium Stadium. They followed champions Manchester City, managed by Kevin Keegan, into the Premiership. =Back to back for Brighton= Brighton & Hove Albion secured successive title winning promotions. This was a massive turnaround for the fortunes of the club which had between 1996 and 1998 finished second bottom of the football league and were on the verge of going out of business. =The Battle of Bramall Lane= One of the seven Albion in their promotion run came on 16 March 2002, against Sheffield United. This match would turn recent English football history, . =ITV Digital crisis plunges league clubs into turmoil= The collapse of debt-ridden ITV Digital in May 2002 plunged many Football League clubs into turmoil. The likes of Bradford City, Nottingham Forest, Watford, Barnsley, Lincoln City and Port Vale filed for administration, fearful that the drastic loss of revenue would put them out of business. Of all the troubled clubs, Bradford City's situation was the most precarious. The West Yorkshire club had debts of ¬£36million and had failed to meet a deadline for a takeover deal. It seemed inevitable that the Bantams, who had gone into liquidation in 1983, would endure a total collapse and lose their place in the Football League. Their only hope was for the Football League to ignore their financial plight and allow them a place in Division One for the 2002‚Äì03 season. =Dario reaches managerial milestone= On 20 November 2001, Dario Gradi took charge of his 1,000 competitive game in charge of Crewe Alexandra in Division One. Gradi had arrived at Crewe in June 1983, and he reached this landmark just four months into a season which had already seen a total of more than 20 managerial changes in the Premiership, Division One, Division Two and Division Three. Crewe ended the season by being relegated to Division Two but the club's directors showed no intention of parting company with the longest-serving manager at any Football League club. =Wimbledon get go-ahead for Milton Keynes move= Just after the end of the Division one season, a three-man panel of The FA gave permission for Wimbledon FC to move from their historic South London home to Milton Keynes. The move sparked outrage among Wimbledon supporters, who formed their own club ‚Äì AFC Wimbledon ‚Äì in response to the controversial plans of chairman Charles Koppel. League tables =FA Premier League= Arsenal won their second Premier League title in five seasons, as well as their second double in the same period, after a remarkable season in which they fought with the rest of the top six for the title right up until the final stages. They scored in every Premier League game, were unbeaten away from home, and finished the league season with 13 successive wins - and also had the satisfaction of clinching the title with a win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in their penultimate game. Liverpool's second-place finish was their highest for 11 years, ironically ending Manchester United's top-two run which had started after theirs had ended. United had rallied well and led the league for a while after losing six league games between mid September and early December, but a few dropped points in the final two months of the season meant that they just couldn't get the better of Arsenal in the title race. Newcastle United, meanwhile, finished fourth in their third season under the management of 69-year-old Bobby Robson, their highest finish for five years. Leeds United and Chelsea had to settle for UEFA Cup qualification after losing ground in the closing stages of the title race, while newly promoted Blackburn Rovers also qualified for the competition as League Cup winners and finished in a secure 10th place. Leicester City's final season at Filbert Street, their home for 111 years, ended in relegation after just five league wins. Joining them in Division One were their local rivals Derby County, who had coincidentally been promoted alongside them six years earlier. Derby had finished not far above the relegation zone in the previous two campaigns, but Leicester had been a top 10 side as recently as two years before their relegation, when they had also won their second League Cup in four seasons. Last to go down were Ipswich Town, who had revived themselves mid-season after a disastrous start, but were unable to halt it after another slide towards the end of the campaign and any hopes of survival were ended on the final day of the season when they were crushed by Liverpool, just one year after qualifying for Europe (albeit they would return to Europe via the Fair Play Award). Sunderland, who had fallen just one place short of Europe in the last two seasons, came just one place away from relegation. Newly promoted Bolton's strong start to the season meant that they survived in 16th place, despite their lackluster form for much of the rest of the season. For the first time in 12 years, all three newly promoted top division sides avoided relegation. Leading goalscorer: Thierry Henry (Arsenal), 24 =First Division= Manchester City managed to make an immediate return from the previous season's relegation, and returned to the Premier League as champions. West Bromwich Albion built on their surprise play-off appearance the previous year, achieving automatic promotion to the top-flight for the first time since 1986 at the expense of local rivals Wolves, who had looked all set for promotion just weeks earlier, but went out of the playoffs against Norwich. The play-offs were won by Birmingham City, finally earning promotion after two successive disappointments, and also returning to the top flight for the first time since 1986. Burnley finished seventh for the second season running, only missing out on the playoffs on goal difference. Local rivals Preston finished eighth, with former Scotland manager Craig Brown now at the helm after David Moyes left for Everton. Stockport County endured a dismal season despite the high-profile appointment of Carlton Palmer as manager, and fell into Division Two. Barnsley also went down, despite a play-off final appearance only two years previously. The final relegation spot was filled by Crewe, who for once were unable to pull off a survival act. Top Goalscorer: Shaun Goater (Man City) - 28 RSSSF Archive of English League Top Goalscorers =Second Division= Brighton earned a second successive championship, despite the loss of manager Micky Adams early in the season - however, they would also have to cope with the loss of replacement manager Peter Taylor after the season ended. Reading earned the runners-up spot after four seasons in Division Two, and the play-offs were won by Stoke City who, despite this success, sacked manager Gudjon Thordarson immediately afterwards (leaving Reading in the odd position of being the only top six side to start the 2002‚Äì03 season with the same manager that they had at the start of the 2001‚Äì02 season). QPR came out of administration at the end of a season where they finished a respectable eighth in their first campaign at this level since the 1960s, featuring in the race for a playoff place until the penultimate game of the season. Wigan Athletic finished a disappointing tenth after successive playoff appearances, but kept faith in manager Paul Jewell to deliver promotion in his second season at the helm. Cambridge United were cut adrift early in the season, and never looked to have much chance of surviving. Long-time Division Two members Wrexham never recovered from a bad start, and also went down. Bury suffered a financial crisis off the pitch and the effects of this ultimately affected the team's performance and sent them down to the League's bottom tier. The final relegation spot was filled by Bournemouth. Leading goalscorer: Bobby Zamora (Brighton and Hove Albion) - 28 =Third Division= Plymouth and Luton were involved in a close fight for the divisional title for the whole season; ultimately Plymouth won out, with Luton taking the runners-up spot and making an immediate return to Division Two after going down the previous season. The third automatic spot was closely contested between Mansfield and Cheltenham; Mansfield were the ultimate victors despite some poor results late in the season, but Cheltenham would win promotion anyway through the play-offs. This was the final season where only a single team would drop out of the League into the Conference. Ultimately there proved to be little drama about who would go down, as it became obvious from the first few weeks that Halifax Town were doomed, never managing to earn enough wins to have any serious chance of survival.

Several terms are often used interchangeably with \\"book entry\\" shares including \\"paperless shares\\", \\"electronic shares\\", \\"digital shares\\", \\"digital stock certificates\\", and \\"uncertificated shares\\". Some of these terms have somewhat different connotations but, at least in the United States, state securities laws only recognize certificated and uncertificated shares. In the case of book-entry-only (BEO) issues, while investors do not receive certificates, a custodian holds one or more global certificates. Dematerialized securities, in contrast, are ones in which no certificates exist; instead, the security issuer, its agent or a central securities depository keeps records, usually electronically of who holds outstanding securities. Most investors who use an online broker or even a regular full- service broker will have their shares held in book-entry form. This is generally convenient, as one does not have to preserve physical stock certificates, and can buy/sell securities without turning certificates in or having new ones issued. Also, replacement costs for certificates are high in case one loses them, while book-entry ownership can never be lost thanks to technological backups. Direct Registration System On August 8, 2006, the SEC approved a rule changed by NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX requiring all listed securities (except certain debt securities) to be eligible for a direct registration system (\\"DRS\\") as of March 31, 2008. DRS is an entirely electronic book-entry style system that does not involve physical stock certificates. The rule change does not eliminate physical certificates, but requires issuers to be eligible for entirely electronic recording of securities ownership. Private Companies Adoption of book-entry systems among private companies has lagged adoption among public companies, public company transfer agents, and broker-dealers. This may be due to a number of misunderstandings and challenges unique to private company security issuance but, regardless, data suggest adoption of book-entry systems among private companies is growing rapidly.

Jackson Park is a 500-acre (2 km¬≤) park located at 6401 South Stony Island Avenue in the Hyde Park and Woodlawn communities on the South Side in Chicago, Illinois. It borders onto Lake Michigan and several other South Side neighborhoods. Named for Seventh President Andrew Jackson, it is one of two Chicago Park District parks with the name \\"Jackson\\", the other being Mahalia Jackson Park for the gospel music singer in the Auburn Gresham community on the far southwest side of Chicago. The parkland was first developed as the host site of the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago World's Fair) in 1893, memorialized today by the Statue of The Republic. The Museum of Science and Industry resides in the remaining \\"palace\\" in the park from the Fair era, and a Japanese garden traces its history to the Fair. The park includes woodland trails, playing fields, a beach, a golf course, and a boat harbor. It is the potential future site of the Barack Obama Presidential Center and library. History =Site of a World's Fair= 1893 World's Fair Court of Honor and Grand Basin in Jackson Park After the state legislature created the South Park Commission in 1869, the designers of New York's Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, were hired to lay out the park (which included the Midway Plaisance and Washington Park). Lois Willie explained in her book Forever Open, Clear, and Free, \\"Olmstead said Jackson Park should be water oriented, with a yacht harbor, winding walkways around the lagoons, small bridges, bathing pavilions, and plenty of space for boating.\\"Wille, Lois. \\"A City Circled by Parks.\\" Forever Open, Clear, and Free; the Historic Struggle for Chicago's Lakefront. 2nd ed. Chicago: U of Chicago, 1991. 54. Print. However, their designs were not put into place at that time, and Jackson Park remained untouched until Chicago was chosen to host the World's Fair several years later. One of the landmarks that recalls the 1893 Columbian Exposition is the Statue of The Republic, only it is now a replica one-third the size of the original The Republic statue. The designers used the Statue of Liberty as inspiration when they were creating the original. Today the 1/3 size statue of The Republic stands at the site of the 1893 Expositions Administration Building. Known originally as \\"South Park\\", the landscape had eastern and western divisions connected by a grand boulevard named the Midway Plaisance. The eastern division became known as \\"Lake Park\\"; however, in 1880 the commission asked the public to suggest official names for both the eastern and western divisions. The names \\"Jackson\\" and \\"Washington\\" were proposed. In the following year, Lake Park was renamed \\"Jackson Park\\" to honor Andrew Jackson (1767‚Äì1845), the seventh president of the United States. In 1890, Chicago won the honor of hosting the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1891, Jackson Park was selected as its site. Olmsted and Chicago's architect and planner, Daniel H. Burnham, with his partner John Wellborn Root, laid out the fairgrounds. A team of architects and sculptors created the \\"White City\\" of plaster buildings and artworks in Beaux-Arts style. The historic World's Fair opened to visitors on May 1, 1893. It was Root's last project, as he caught pneumonia and died in January 1891, two years before the fair's opening. After the fair closed, the site was transformed back into parkland, as the fair buildings were not designed to be permanent structures. Jackson Park featured the first public golf course west of the Alleghenies, which opened in 1899. Colonel B. J. D. Irwin, a retired military surgeon and local golfer, sought democratization of recreation in Chicago, and ensured that Jackson Park Golf Course be made open to the public for free, such that \\"golfers of limited means... can play at almost nominal cost, and cheaper facilities in Chicago would permit of a number enjoying the game who at present are debarred by the dues demanded by the local clubs\\". =Intervening years= Most of the park burned to the ground after the fair closed. A headline from January 9. 1894 read \\"THE WHITE CITY IN FLAMES; FIRE DESTROYS THE FAIREST OF THE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS\\". On May 16, 1896 the Jackson Park Yacht Club (JPYC) was organized with incorporation on June 3 but the original organization failed. Rights to the club were purchased and a new JPYC was formed with thirty-eight members with about twenty boats. The Park Commission's aid was sought to dredge and clear a channel through the wreckage of the exposition. By 1901 membership had expanded to 149 with 105 boats. By 1902, with the club house built of scrap lumber on a purchased scow, the club joined the Lake Michigan Yachting Association. Over the next years the club grew in membership and in competitive yachts. By 1915 plans were underway for a new club house with sixteen life memberships the core of the funding for the new structure which was dedicated on Memorial Day 1916 by Governor Edward F. Dunne, who arrived on William A. Lydon's 181 foot steam yacht . The Palace of Fine Arts decayed after the fair until it was reopened as the Museum of Science and Industry in 1933. Sears, Roebuck & Company president Julius Rosenwald donated the initial investment. During World War II, vandals severely damaged the Japanese Garden. The Chicago Park District waited for decades before considering repairing it. Eventually, the city of Osaka donated money for the refurbishment. During the Cold War, part of Jackson Park contained a Nike Surface-to-Air Missile site and the nearby \\"Point\\" was used as its radar station. In the 1950s, Jackson Park's Wooded Island was almost leased to the Army to become the location of an anti-aircraft installation, but was strongly protested against, as the Park District had given the Army other location options and Jackson Park's Wooded Island was spared.Wille, Lois. Forever Open, Clear, and Free: The Struggle for Chicago's Lakefront. Chicago: U of Chicago, 1991. Print. In 1965 the people of South Chicago were growing tired of the traffic jams on Lake Shore Drive, so the city made plans to widen the road, straighten its curves and run it straight through Jackson Park. Women and children then conducted protests and rallies around tree stumps. The efforts eventually brought results and the city halted roadwork after it had already gone halfway through the park. In 1972 Jackson Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. = Rehabilitation = Jackson Park Lagoon A nonprofit organization called Project 120 began collaborating with the Chicago Park District in 2012 to restore Jackson Park to designer Frederick Law Olmsted's vision. The group's plans include improving the park's green space, creating a music pavilion, and creating a great lawn for park-goers to use for leisure activities. In October 2016 Yoko Ono unveiled a permanent artwork called Skylanding on the Wooded Island; it is Ono's first permanent art installation in the United States. Ono said she was inspired during a visit to the Garden of the Phoenix in 2013 and that she feels a connection to the city of Chicago. Jackson Park has a number of volunteers who help maintain the park, but Project 120 aims to go beyond cleanup and plant maintenance. At a cost of about $8.1 million, habitat restoration on Jackson Park's Wooded Island began in 2015 and will continue until 2019. Restoration will take five years to complete and another 25 years reach ecological maturity. The restoration is being done as part of the Army Corps of Engineers Great Lakes Fishery & Ecosystem Restoration (GLFER) program. Improving the park's green space and enhancing its wildlife are meant to improve the appearance and popularity of a park that has been in decline. Some aspects of the restoration, especially plans for a music pavilion, have generated controversy.  Remaining World's Columbian Exposition structures  Jackson Park from 1700 East 56th Street One of Jackson Park's bird trails. Osaka Garden on Wooded Island Osaka Garden at Jackson ParkWhile a comfort station and the North Pond Bridge, both of which date from the 1880s, are still in use, every structure built for World's Columbian Exposition was long ago destroyed by fire, demolished or moved elsewhere, except for the old Palace of Fine Arts, now the Museum of Science and Industry, the only fireproof building at the fair, which fell into disrepair and was rehabilitated with a $5 million grant in 1930 from Julius Rosenwald (President of Sears, Roebuck and Co.). The only other relic from the fair still in the same location is the \\"Osaka Garden,\\" a Japanese strolling garden. It was reconstructed on its original site on the Wooded Island after being vandalized during World War II. (By itself, the Wooded Island is considered one of \\"150 great places in Illinois\\" by the American Institute of Architects.) The only other significant building that survived the fair is the Norway Pavilion, a building now preserved at a museum called \\"Little Norway\\" in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. \\"The Viking,\\" a replica of the ancient Viking ship The Gokstad, built at Framnes Shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway in 1892 and sailed across the Atlantic to the fair in 1893, is currently located at Good Templar Park in Geneva, Illinois. The full-scale replica of Columbus's flagship the Santa Mar√≠a rotted in the Jackson Park Yacht Basin (along Promontory Drive) near La Rabida. In May 1952, what was left of the rotting hulk was dismantled and dredged out of the Yacht Basin. The Art Institute of Chicago also occupies a building originally constructed for the Exposition, with the intent of housing the museum upon closing of the fair; this Exposition building is the only one not located in Jackson Park. Girders from fair structures were reused in the construction of Dunns Bridge and the Sugar Creek Chapel Bridge. Recreational features Jackson Park is utilized in many ways. It comprises which include a gymnasium with three multipurpose rooms and a fitness center. Some of Jackson Park's green features consist of a vegetable garden and a flower garden. There are also seasonal sports available, arts and crafts, tennis lessons, piano lessons, after school programs, summer day camps, and holiday themed events. During the summer season for the Chicago Park District (Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend), the 63rd Street beach and the adjacent Lake Michigan is a destination for beachgoers. The Beach House competes with the South Shore Cultural Center and Promontory Point as South Side beachfront special-use facilities in the Park District. The park also hosts the Chicago Landmark 63rd Street Bathing Pavilion, the 18-hole Jackson Park Golf Course, two walking trails, as well as two basketball courts. courtsoftheworld.com The Lakeside Lawn Bowling Club and the Chicago Croquet Club share two natural grass courts just off Lakeshore Drive and Science Avenue, to the south of the Museum of Science and Industry. The Jackson Park Golf Course, which opened in 1900, was the first public golf course in the Midwest. It was free until 1920, and in 1925 it was named the world's busiest golf course. As a result of both a steady decline in the surrounding neighborhood as well as the closing of the lagoons' connection to the 59th Street inner harbor, the lagoons deteriorated. In recent years, the state and city have spent millions of dollars to revitalize the lagoons and Garden of the Phoenix, and to restore the lagoons to their original grandeur. With the recent revitalization projects and the decision by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to stock them with fish, the lagoons have become a very popular local fishing spot.  Garden of the Phoenix  =History= The Garden of the Phoenix in Chicago's Jackson Park, with a view of the Museum of Science and Industry Jackson Park's Japanese gardens were originally created during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, with a garden and a Japanese Ho-O Den (Phoenix Temple) for the government of Japan as a pavilion for the exposition. The pavilion was based on the Ho-o-Do (Phoenix Hall) of the Byodo-in Temple in Kyoto. The phoenix emblem was a reference to Chicago rising like the mythical firebird from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. After the 1893 Fair, most of the Fair structures were burned or torn down, but the garden and the Ho-O Den Pavilion remained intact. In 1933 the government of Japan constructed a traditional tea house at the Century of Progress World's Fair and also created a garden on Wooded Island's northeast side and refurbished the Ho-O Den. After WWII the pavilion and tea house were destroyed by fire and the garden was abandoned. After the city of Osaka became Chicago's sister city, one the goals of the Sister Cities program became to revive the Japanese Garden in Jackson Park. With the collective efforts of the City of Osaka and the Chicago Park District, the gardens were restored and named \\"Osaka Garden\\" in 1993 in honor of that city's help and friendship. The gardens were renamed Garden of the Phoenix in 2013. =Features= The pavilion at the Osaka Garden There is a koi pond within the garden. The garden in itself is very peaceful, and the simplicity of the pond and the large fish swimming calmly inside provides a serene atmosphere. The stones within the park carry an old legend which says they are laid in a zigzag because evil spirits can only move in a straight line, so if you cross the stones, any evil spirits will just fall into the water. The Kasuga Lantern is one of the lamps that survived from 1893. It takes its name from the Kasuga Shrine in Nara, Japan. The deer panel is one of the four traditional symbols, the others were a stag, the sun, and the moon, most of which are damaged. The garden holds American plantings, but it also holds unique Japanese plants, usually found only in Japan. The theme of the garden, from 1893 to the present, is peace. It holds a harmony of the peace and balance possible between countries and cultures, between nature and city. Its wandering, stone pathways are designed to encourage a sense of peace around and within its visitors. The garden is meant to resemble natural scenery but at a small scale, with representation of mountains, islands and lakes. The garden is intended to provide a tranquil space for meditation. Wildlife Jackson Park is home to over two dozen species of birds, including a well-studied population of feral monk parakeets, descendants of pet birds that escaped in the 1960s. Connections to other parks Jackson Park is connected by the Midway Plaisance to Washington Park (see Encyclopedia of Chicago Map). In accordance with a canal that Olmsted wanted built between the two parks, a long excavation was made on the Midway, but water has never been allowed in. It is connected to Grant Park by Burnham Park. The Chicago Lakefront Trail (abbreviated as LFT) is an 18-mile multi-use path in Chicago, Illinois along the shore of Lake Michigan. It is popular with cyclists and joggers. From north to south, it runs through Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park.Chicago Park District Lakefront Trail Map Site for Barack Obama Presidential Center and library In 2014, Jackson Park came under scrutiny as a member of the short list of potential sites for the Barack Obama Presidential Center and library. Sonya Malunda from the office of civic engagement of the University of Chicago requested a meeting with Louise Mccurry, president of the Jackson Park Advisory Council, to talk about the library.Sam Cholke, \\"U. of C. Asks for Meeting About Putting the Obama Library in Jackson Park\\". DNAinfo November 11, 2014.http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20141111/hyde-park/u-of-c-asks-for- meeting-about-putting-obama-library-jackson-park On July 27, 2016, President Barack Obama officially selected the park to be the location where his presidential library would be built. The library will be designed by the New York‚Äìbased firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects and is slated to open in 2021. In an unveiling of the presidential library's plans on May 4, 2017, the presidential library compound is revealed to incorporate the Jackson Park end of Midway Plaisance from the north (which is to be readapted into a water basin), and a parcel of parkland and the park hockey fields to the south, where the main buildings will be predominantly located. As part of a wider plan to reclaim parkland and improve park safety, the project also necessitates the closure of South Cornell Drive between 60th and 67th Streets, a 6-lane park thoroughfare that runs along the western park lagoon and golf course from Midway Plaisance to South Shore.

He was considered a British subject by birth and was the central figure in the Anglo-Greek dispute of 1850, known as the Don Pacifico Affair. Biography =Early life= Pacifico was a Sephardic Jew of Italian descent. Pacifico's grandfather, of the same name, was born in Italy eventually settled down in Gibraltar. His family had been expelled from Spain with the rest of the Jews in 1492. His ancestors reached Italy, particularly Tuscany, first Leghorn and then Florence. As Pacifico grew up in Portugal because of his father's work, he was speaking fluent Portuguese. That led to the myth of Portuguese descent for the Pacificos, who were actually of Spanish descent.Roy Jenkins, Gladstone: A Biography (Random House, 2002). Pacifico's parents were married in Bevis Marks Synagogue in London in 1761. He gave varying accounts of his birth, placing it either in Oran, which belonged to Spain at the time, or in Gibraltar, which was a British possession. He once claimed to be a Spanish subject.David Steele, \\"Pacifico, David [Don Pacifico (1784?‚Äì1854)\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 February 2017. A liberal living in Portugal during the Civil War of 1828‚Äì34, he was persecuted by the Miguelists. In 1835, after the war, he was rewarded by the victorious liberals with a consulship in Morocco and Portuguese citizenship. From 1837 to 1842, he served as consul-general in Athens, during which time he also engaged in commerce and became prominent in the local Jewish community. =Greece= Pacifico continued residing in Greece after he was stripped of his position for repeatedly overstepping his authority in 1842. Giannis Kairofylas, The History of Psiri District [Œó ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ œÉœÖŒΩŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ®œÖœÅŒÆ] (Athens: Filippotis Editions, 2000), p. 102 In April 1847, in order not to offend a visiting French Jewish financier, a member of the Rothschild family, the government banned the traditional burning of Judas Iscariot in effigy during Greek Orthodox Easter celebrations. An angry mob sacked Pacifico's house as police looked on. Pacifico then enlisted the aid of the British legation in claiming ¬£32,000 in compensation from the Greek government for damage to his property, plus 10% interest and ¬£500 for physical violence against Pacifico himself. The claim was approved by Lord Palmerston, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He also claimed compensation for land of his that had been acquired by the state. While this latter claim was accepted, the Greek government ignored his claims relating to the riot. The affair came to a head in January 1850, when the Royal Navy blockaded Athens to force Greece to settle Pacifico's claims and others'. Through French and Russian intervention, his claims were reduced, the blockade lifted and Greece agreed to pay. =London= The Don Pacifico affair provoked a debate in Parliament. Palmerston justified his actions in a speech to the house on 25 June 1850, using the phrase, Civis romanus sum, translated as \\"I am a Roman citizen\\", the declaration by a Roman to protect him from harm anywhere in the Roman Empire. He railed against the anti-Semitic prejudice that \\"because a man is of the Jewish persuasion, he is fair game for any outrage.\\" In a vote on an opposition motion, the right of a British subject to appeal for aid anywhere in the world was affirmed by the house with a majority of forty-six. Despite his international prominence, Pacifico was unpopular with London's Jews. He died at 15 Bury Street in London on 12 April 1854 and was buried two days later at the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' cemetery at Mile End Road.

Background According to the history compilation Samguk Sagi, he was the son of the previous king Giru. He became king upon Giru's death in 128 which was the 52nd year of his reign. The Samguk Sagi records that \\"his character was respectful and also orderly in his conduct\\".Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Reign In 132, he founded Bukhansanseong in present-day Goyang city, Gyeonggi, South Korea. Baekje fought off many Goguryeo (the northern Korean kingdom) invasions from this fortress, and the 5th king Chogo based his northward campaign on it. Baekje's relationship with the southeastern rival Silla was peaceful for most of his period of reign. However, in 145, a Silla minister named Gilseon (Í∏∏ÏÑ†/ÂêâÂÆ£) failed his coup d'etat attempt and fled to Baekje. Gaeru gave him refuge despite the Silla king Adalla's written request for his return. Silla subsequently attacked Baekje, and a broad war over the Sobaek Mountains ensued. Samguk Sagi: * 131 AD, summer, fourth month. The king went hunting at Mt. Han. * 132 AD, spring, second month. The fortress of Mt. Bukhan (Bukhansanseong) was constructed. * 137 AD, autumn, eighth month. Mars moved into the Southern Dipper. * 145 AD, spring, first month, last day of the month. There was a solar eclipse. Winter, tenth month. Ajan Gilseon of Silla made a treasonous plot but it was discovered and he came to our country. The king of Silla sent a written request for him but he was not sent back. The king of Silla was furious and led soldiers out and came to attack. All the fortresses were fortified and defended themselves, and he could not get in. The Sillan soldiers used all their stores and returned. During the Spring and Autumn Period, when Pu of Chu fled to Lu, Ji Wenzi said, \\"Seeing one who conducts himself properly toward his lord is like seeing a child who is filial to its father and mother. Upon seeing one who is not proper to his lord, he should be killed like a hawk on a sparrow. Seeing Pu of Chu, [he said that] he has no measure of virtue and had murderous ethics, and this passed. Now Gilseon was also a wicked and rebellious man, and the king of Baekje took him in and hid him. Thus we can say that concealing a villain makes one a harborer. Therefore, the peace was lost with neighboring countries, and the king made his people suffer under the burden of attack. This lacked insight.Best, Jonathan (2007). A History of the Early Korean Kingdom, p230 Legacy The Samguk Sagi states that Gaeru's eldest son became the 5th king Chogo and the second son became the 8th king Goi. This chronological inconsistency is thought to indicate a power struggle between two royal lines. The 21st king Gaero (also known as Geungaeru) apparently took Gaeru's name to assert the legitimacy of this.

It is also described as a theory that \\"the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe.\\" It is one of the oldest philosophical theories, and has been ascribed to philosophers including Thales, Plato, Spinoza, Leibniz, William James, Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, and Galen Strawson. In the 19th century, panpsychism was the default philosophy of mind in Western thought, but it saw a decline in the mid-20th century with the rise of logical positivism. Recent interest in the hard problem of consciousness has revived interest in panpsychism. Overview =Etymology= The term panpsychism /panÀàs å…™k…™z(…ô)m/,/p√¶nÀàsa…™(Àå)k…™z(…ô)m/ comes from the Greek pan (œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ : \\"all, everything, whole\\") and psyche (œàœÖœáŒÆ: \\"soul, mind\\").Clarke, D.S. Panpsychism: Past and Recent Selected Readings. State University of New York Press, 2004. p.1 \\"Psyche\\" comes from the Greek word œàœçœáœâ (psukh≈ç, \\"I blow\\") and may mean life, soul, mind, spirit, heart, or \\"life-breath\\". The use of \\"psyche\\" is controversial because it is synonymous with \\"soul\\", a term usually taken to refer to something supernatural; more common terms now found in the literature include mind, mental properties, mental aspect, and experience. =Concept= Panpsychism holds that mind or a mind-like aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. It is also described as a theory that \\"the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe\\". Panpsychists posit that the type of mentality we know through our own experience is present, in some form, in a wide range of natural bodies. This notion has taken on a wide variety of forms. Some historical and non-Western panpsychists ascribe attributes such as life or spirits to all entities. Contemporary academic proponents, however, hold that sentience or subjective experience is ubiquitous, while distinguishing these qualities from more complex human mental attributes. So they ascribe a primitive form of mentality to entities at the fundamental level of physics but do not ascribe mentality to most aggregate things, such as rocks or buildings. =Terminology= The philosopher David Chalmers, who has explored panpsychism as a viable theory, distinguishes between microphenomenal experiences (the experiences of microphysical entities) and macrophenomenal experiences (the experiences of larger entities, such as humans). Philip Goff draws a distinction between panexperientialism and pancognitivism. In the form of panpsychism under discussion in the contemporary literature, conscious experience is present everywhere at a fundamental level, hence the term panexperientialism. Pancognitivism, by contrast, is the view that thought is present everywhere at a fundamental level‚Äîa view that had some historical advocates, but no present-day academic adherents. Contemporary panpsychists do not believe microphysical entities have complex mental states such as beliefs, desires, and fears. Originally, the term panexperientialism had a narrower meaning, having been coined by David Ray Griffin to refer specifically to the form of panpsychism used in process philosophy (see below). History =Antiquity= iwakura ‚Äì a rock where a kami or spirit is said to reside in the religion of Shinto Panpsychist views are a staple in pre-Socratic Greek philosophy.Seager, William and Allen-Hermanson, Sean. \\"Panpsychism\\". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) According to Aristotle, Thales (c. 624 ‚Äì 545 BCE), the first Greek philosopher, posited a theory which held \\"that everything is full of gods.\\"Aristotle. De Anima 411a7‚Äì8. Thales believed that magnets demonstrated this. This has been interpreted as a panpsychist doctrine. Other Greek thinkers associated with panpsychism include Anaxagoras (who saw the underlying principle or arche as nous or mind), Anaximenes (who saw the arche as pneuma or spirit) and Heraclitus (who said \\"The thinking faculty is common to all\\"). Plato argues for panpsychism in his Sophist, in which he writes that all things participate in the form of Being and that it must have a psychic aspect of mind and soul (psyche). In the Philebus and Timaeus, Plato argues for the idea of a world soul or anima mundi. According to Plato: > This world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... > a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which > by their nature are all related.Plato, Timaeus, 29/30; fourth century BCE Stoicism developed a cosmology that held that the natural world is infused with the divine fiery essence pneuma, directed by the universal intelligence logos. The relationship between beings' individual logos and the universal logos was a central concern of the Roman Stoic Marcus Aurelius. The metaphysics of Stoicism finds connections with Hellenistic philosophies such as Neoplatonism. Gnosticism also made use of the Platonic idea of anima mundi. =Renaissance= World Soul is depicted as a woman After Emperor Justinian closed Plato's Academy in 529 CE, neoplatonism declined. Though there were mediaeval Christian thinkers, such as John Scotus Eriugena, who ventured what might be called panpsychism, it was not a dominant strain in Christian thought. But in the Italian Renaissance, it enjoyed something of a revival in the thought of figures such as Gerolamo Cardano, Bernardino Telesio, Francesco Patrizi, Giordano Bruno, and Tommaso Campanella. Cardano argued for the view that soul or anima was a fundamental part of the world, and Patrizi introduced the term panpsychism into philosophical vocabulary. According to Bruno, \\"There is nothing that does not possess a soul and that has no vital principle.\\" Platonist ideas resembling the anima mundi also resurfaced in the work of esoteric thinkers such as Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, and Cornelius Agrippa. =Early modern period= In the 17th century, two rationalists, Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, can be said to be panpsychists. In Spinoza's monism, the one single infinite and eternal substance is \\"God, or Nature\\" (Deus sive Natura), which has the aspects of mind (thought) and matter (extension). Leibniz's view is that there are infinitely many absolutely simple mental substances called monads that make up the universe's fundamental structure. While it has been said that George Berkeley's idealist philosophy is also a form of panpsychism, Berkeley rejected panpsychism and posited that the physical world exists only in the experiences minds have of it, while restricting minds to humans and certain other specific agents.Berkeley, George (1948-57, Nelson) Robinson, H. (ed.) (1996). \\"Principles of Human Knowledge and Three Dialogues\\", pp ix-x & passim. Oxford University Press, Oxford. . =19th century= In the 19th century, panpsychism was at its zenith. Philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, C.S. Peirce, Josiah Royce, William James, Eduard von Hartmann, F.C.S. Schiller, Ernst Haeckel and William Kingdon Clifford as well as psychologists such as Gustav Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt and Rudolf Hermann Lotze all promoted panpsychist ideas. Arthur Schopenhauer argued for a two-sided view of reality as both Will and Representation (Vorstellung). According to Schopenhauer, \\"All ostensible mind can be attributed to matter, but all matter can likewise be attributed to mind\\". Josiah Royce, the leading American absolute idealist, held that reality is a \\"world self\\", a conscious being that comprises everything, though he didn't necessarily attribute mental properties to the smallest constituents of mentalistic \\"systems\\". The American pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce espoused a sort of psycho-physical monism in which the universe is suffused with mind, which he associated with spontaneity and freedom. Following Pierce, William James also espoused a form of panpsychism.Ford, Marcus P. (1981). William James: Panpsychist and Metaphysical Realist. Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, Vol. 17, No. 2. pp. 158‚Äì170. In his lecture notes, James wrote: > Our only intelligible notion of an object in itself is that it should be an > object for itself, and this lands us in panpsychism and a belief that our > physical perceptions are effects on us of 'psychical' realities In 1893, Paul Carus proposed a philosophy similar to panpsychism, \\"panbiotism\\", according to which \\"everything is fraught with life; it contains life; it has the ability to live.\\"Skrbina, David. (2005). Panpsychism in the West. MIT Press. Carus, Paul. (1893). \\"Panpsychism and Panbiotism.\\" The Monist. Vol. 3, No. 2. pp. 234‚Äì257. =20th century= In the 20th century, panpsychism's most significant proponent is arguably Alfred North Whitehead (1861‚Äì1947). Whitehead's ontology saw the basic nature of the world as made up of events and the process of their creation and extinction. These elementary events (which he called occasions) are in part mental. According to Whitehead, \\"we should conceive mental operations as among the factors which make up the constitution of nature.\\" Bertrand Russell's neutral monist views tended toward panpsychism. The physicist Arthur Eddington also defended a form of panpsychism. The psychologist Carl Jung, who is known for his idea of the collective unconscious, wrote that \\"psyche and matter are contained in one and the same world, and moreover are in continuous contact with one another\\", and that it was probable that \\"psyche and matter are two different aspects of one and the same thing\\".Orig. source unknown, cited in Danah Zohar & Ian Marshall, SQ: Connecting with our Spiritual Intelligence, Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 81. The psychologists James Ward and Charles Augustus Strong also endorsed variants of panpsychism.Calvert, Ernest Reid. (1942). The Panpsychism of James Ward and Charles A. Strong. Boston University.Blamauer, Michael. (2011). The Mental as Fundamental: New Perspectives on Panpsychism. Ontos. p. 35. The geneticist Sewall Wright endorsed a version of panpsychism. He believed that the birth of consciousness was not due to a mysterious property of increasing complexity, but rather an inherent property, implying the most elementary particles have these properties.Steffes, David M. (2007). Panpsychic Organicism: Sewall Wright's Philosophy for Understanding Complex Genetic Systems. Journal of the History of Biology. Vol. 40, No. 2. pp. 327‚Äì361. =Contemporary= Panpsychism has recently seen a resurgence in the philosophy of mind, set into motion by Thomas Nagel's 1979 article \\"Panpsychism\\"Nagel, Thomas (1979), \\"Panpsychism\\", in and further spurred by Galen Strawson's 2006 realistic monist article \\"Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism.\\"Strawson, Galen (2006). \\"Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism\\". Journal of Consciousness Studies. Volume 13, No 10‚Äì11, Exeter, Imprint Academic pp. 3‚Äì31. Other recent proponents include American philosophers David Ray Griffin and David Skrbina, British philosophers Gregg Rosenberg, Timothy Sprigge, and Philip Goff, and Canadian philosopher William Seager. The British philosopher David Papineau, while distancing himself from orthodox panpsychists, has written that his view is \\"not unlike panpsychism\\" in that he rejects a line in nature between \\"events lit up by phenomenology [and] those that are mere darkness.\\" Panpsychism has also been applied in environmental philosophy by Australian philosopher Freya Mathews, who has put forward the notion of ontopoetics as a version of panpsychism. She calls ontopoetics \\"postmaterialist\\" for the way it breaks with the fundamental metaphysical premise of reductive materialism. In 1990, the physicist David Bohm published \\"A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter,\\" a paper based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics. The philosopher Paavo Pylkk√§nen has described Bohm's view as a version of panprotopsychism. The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT), proposed by the neuroscientist and psychiatrist Giulio Tononi in 2004 and since adopted by other neuroscientists such as Christof Koch, postulates that consciousness is widespread and can be found even in some simple systems. In 2019 cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman published The Case Against Reality: How evolution hid the truth from our eyes. Hoffman argues that consensus reality lacks concrete existence, and is nothing more than an evolved user-interface. He argues that the true nature of reality are abstract \\"conscious agents\\". Science editor Annaka Harris argues that panpsychism is a viable theory in her 2019 book Conscious, though she stops short of fully endorsing it. Varieties of panpsychism A wide breadth of views, theories, or ontologies can be considered panpsychist; the only requirement is that experience is ubiquitous. = Philosophical frameworks = In theory, panpsychism is compatible with all four of the above frameworks.  Cosmopsychism  Cosmopsychism hypothosizes that the cosmos is a unified object that is ontologically prior to its parts. It has been described as an alternative to panpsychism, or as a form of panpsychism. Proponents of cosmopsychism claim that the cosmos as a whole is the fundamental level of reality and that it instantiates consciousness. They differ on that point from panpsychists, who usually claim that the smallest level of reality is fundamental and instantiates consciousness. Accordingly, human consciousness, for example, merely derives from a larger cosmic consciousness. Idealism According to the philosophers William Segear and Sean Allen-Hermenson, \\"idealists are panpsychists by default\\". But idealism differs from other forms of panpsychism in some key ways. Both hold that everything that exists has some form of experience. Normally, panpsychists come to this conclusion by believing that things in the external world, such as elections or bits, have some rudimentary form of experience. In contrast, idealists hold that everything that exists has experience by simply denying the external world exists in the first place. Chalmers also contrasts panpsychism with idealism (as well as materialism and dualism). Uwe Meixner argues that panpsychism has both dualistic and idealist forms. He further divides the latter into \\"atomistic idealistic panpsychism,\\" which he ascribes to David Hume, and \\"holistic idealistic panpsychism,\\" which he favors. Neutral monism Neutral monism rejects the dichotomy of mind and matter, instead taking a neutral third variable as fundamental. Just what that third variable is is up for debate, and many choose to leave it undefined. This has lead to a variety of different formulations of neutral monism, many of which broadly overlap with other philosophies. In The Conscious Mind, Chalmers writes that, in some instances, the differences between \\"Russell's neutral monism\\" and his property dualism are merely semantic. In versions of neutral monism in which the fundamental constituents of the world are neither mental nor physical, it is quite distinct from panpsychism. In versions where the fundamental constituents are both mental and physical, neutral monism may lead to panpsychism, panprotopsychism, or dual aspect theory. Goff believes that neutral monism can reasonably be regarded as a form of panpsychism \\"in so far as it is a dual aspect view.\\" Neutral monism, panpsychism, and dual aspect theory may be conflated or used interchangeably in some contexts.  Panexperientialism  Panexperientialism is associated with the philosophies of, among others, Charles Hartshorne and Alfred North Whitehead, although the term itself was invented by David Ray Griffin in order to distinguish the process philosophical view from other varieties of panpsychism. Whitehead's process philosophy argues that the fundamental elements of the universe are \\"occasions of experience,\\" which can together create something as complex as a human being. Building off Whitehead's work, process philosopher Michel Weber argues for a pancreativism.See, e.g., his Whitehead's Pancreativism. The Basics (Foreword by Nicholas Rescher, Frankfurt / Paris, Ontos Verlag, 2006) Goff has used the term panexperientialism more generally to refer to forms of panpsychism in which experience rather than thought is ubiquitous.  Panprotopsychism  pan (œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ : \\"all, everything, whole\\"); proto (œÄœÅ·ø∂œÑŒøœÇ : ‚Äúfirst‚Äù); and psyche (œàœÖœáŒÆ: \\"soul, mind\\"). Panprotopsychists believe that higher-order phenomenal properties (such as qualia) are logically entailed by protophenomenial properties, at least in principle. The combination problem thus holds no weight; it is not phenomenal properties that are pervasive, but protophenomenal properties. And protophenomenal properties are by definition the constituent parts of consciousness. Chalmers argues that the view faces difficulty in dealing with the combination problem. He considers Russell's proposed solution \\"ad hoc\\", and believes it diminishes the parsimony that made the theory initially interesting.David Chalmers (1996) The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory, pp. 153-6. Oxford University Press, New York, (Pbk.)  Russellian monism  Russellian monism is a type of neutral monism. The theory is attributed to Bertrand Russell, and may also be called Russell's panpsychism, or Russell's neutral monism. Russell believed that all causal properties are extrinsic manifestations of identical intrinsic properties. Russell called these identical internal properties quiddities. Just as the extrinsic properties of matter can form higher-order structure, so can their corresponding and identical quiddities. Russell believed the conscious mind was one such structure. = Religious or mystical ontologies =  Advaita VedƒÅnta  Advaita VedƒÅnta is a form of idealism in Indian philosophy which views consensus reality as illusory. Anand Vaidya and Purushottama Bilimoria have argued that it can be considered a form of panpsychism or cosmopsychism. Animism and hylozoism Animism maintains that all things have a soul, and hylozoism maintains that all things are alive. Both could reasonably be interpreted as panpsychist, but both have fallen out of favour in contemporary academia. Modern panpsychists have tried to distance themselves from theories of this sort, careful to carve out the distinction between the ubiquity of experience and the ubiquity of mind and cognition. Buddha-nature The term Buddha-nature is the English translation of the classical Chinese term ‰ΩõÊÄß (or f√≥ x√¨ng in pinying), which is in turn a translation of the Sanskrit tathƒÅgatagarbha. TathƒÅgata refers to someone (namely the Buddha) having arrived, while garbha translates into the words embryo or root.In the art of the Japanese rock garden, the artist must be aware of the \\"ishigokoro\\" ('heart', or 'mind') of the rocks Broadly speaking, Buddha-nature can be defined as the ubiquitous dispositional state of being capable of obtaining Buddhahood. In some Buddhist traditions, this may be interpreted as implying a form of panpsychism. D. C. Clark, a philosopher of mind and the author of Panpsychism and the Religious Attitude, argues that most \\"traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean philosophy would qualify as panpsychist in nature.\\" The Huayan, Tiantai, and Tendai schools of Buddhism explicitly attributed Buddha-nature to inanimate objects such as lotus flowers and mountains. Similarly, Soto Zen master Dogen argued that \\"insentient beings expound\\" the teachings of the Buddha, and wrote about the \\"mind\\" (ÂøÉ,shin) of \\"fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles\\". The 9th-century Shingon Buddhist thinker Kukai went so far as to argue that natural objects such as rocks and stones are part of the supreme embodiment of the Buddha. According to Clark, Buddha-nature is best described \\"in western terms\\" as something \\"psychophysical.\\"Parks, Graham. \\"The awareness of rocks.\\" Skrbina David, ed. Mind that Abides. Chapter 17. = Scientific theories =  Conscious realism  Conscious realism is a theory proposed by Donald Hoffman, a cognitive scientist specialising in perception. He has written numerous papers on the topicPublications, Donald D. Hoffman which he summarised in his 2019 book The Case Against Reality: How evolution hid the truth from our eyes. Conscious realism builds upon Hoffman's former User- Interface Theory. In combination they argue that (1) consensus reality and spacetime are illusory, and are merely a \\"species specific evolved user interface\\"; (2) Reality is made of a complex, dimensionless, and timeless network of \\"conscious agents\\". The consensus view is that perception is a reconstruction of one's environment. Hoffman views perception as a construction of rather than a reconstruction. He argues that perceptual systems as analogous to information channels, and thus subject to data compression. The set of possible representations for any given data set is quite large. Of that set, the subset that is homomorphic is minuscule, and does not overlap with the subset that is efficient or easiest to use. Hoffman offers the \\"fitness beats truth theorem\\"Prakash, Stephens, Hoffman, Singh, Fields. \\"Fitness Beats Truth in the Evolution of Perception\\". http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/FBT-7-30-17 as mathematical proof that perceptions of reality bear little resemblance to realities true nature. Even if reality is an illusion, Hoffman takes consciousness as an indisputable fact. He represents rudimentary units of consciousness (which he calls \\"conscious agents\\") as Markovien kernels. Though the theory was not initially panpsychist, he reports that he and his college Chetan Prakash found the math to be more parsimonious if it were. They hypothesize that reality is composed of these conscious agents, who interact to form \\"larger, more complex\\" networks.Fields, Chris; Hoffman, Donald; Prakash, Chetan; Singh, Manish. Conscious agent networks: Formal analysis and application to cognitionAxioms and postulates of integrated information theory  Integrated information theory  Giulio Tononi first articulated Integrated information theory (IIT) in 2004, and it has undergone two major revisions since then. Tononi approaches consciousness from a scientific perspective, and has expressed frustration with philosophical theories of consciousness for lacking predictive power. Though integral to his theory, he refrains from philosophical terminology such as qualia or the unity of consciousness, instead opting for mathematically precise alternatives like entropy function and information integration. This has allowed Tononi to create measurement for integrated information, which he calls phi (Œ¶). He believes consciousness is nothing but integrated information, so Œ¶ measures consciousness.Mayner WGP, Marshall W, Albantakis L, Findlay G, Marchman R, Tononi G. (2018). PyPhi: A toolbox for integrated information theory. PLOS Computational Biology 14(7): e1006343. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006343 As it turns out, even basic objects or substances have a nonzero degree of Œ¶. This would mean that consciousness is ubiquitous, albeit to a minimal degree. The philosopher Hedda Hassel M√∏rch's views IIT as similar to Russellian monism, while other philosophers, such as Chalmers and John Searle, consider it a form of panpsychism. IIT does not hold that all systems are conscious, leading Tononi and Koch to state that IIT incorporates some elements of panpsychism but not others. Koch has called IIT a \\"scientifically refined version\\" of panpsychism. Arguments in favor of panpsychism = Hard problem of consciousness = It feels like something to be a human brain.Nagel, Thomas. \\"What is it Like to be a Bat?\\". From The Philosophical Review LXXXIII, 4 (October 1974), pp. 435-450 This means that matter, when organised in a particular way, begins to have an experience. The questions of why and how this material structure has experience, and why it has that particular experience rather than another experience, are known as the hard problem of consciousness. The term is attributed to Chalmers. He argues that even after \\"all the perceptual and cognitive functions within the vicinity\\" of consciousness\\" are accounted for, \\"there may still remain a further unanswered question: Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?\\" Though Chalmers gave the hard problem of consciousness its present name, similar views had been expressed before. Isaac Newton, John Locke, Gottfried Libniz, John Stuart Mill,Mill, John Stuart. A System of Logic (1843), Book V, Chapter V, section 3 Thomas Henry Huxley, Wilhelm Wundt, all wrote about the seeming incompatibility of third-person functional descriptions of mind and matter and first-person conscious experience. Similar sentiments have been articulated through philosophical inquiries such as the problem of other minds, solipsism, the explanatory gap, philosophical zombies, and Mary's room. These problems have caused Chalmers to consider panpsychism a viable solution to the hard problem,David Chalmers. The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996. though he is not committed to any single view. Garrett Johnson has compared the hard problem to vitalism, the now discredited hypothesis that life is inexplicable and can only be understood if some vital life force exists. He maintains that given time, consciousness and its evolutionary origins will be understood just as life is now understood. Daniel Dennett has called the hard problem a \\"hunch,\\" and maintains that conscious experience, as it is usually understood, is merely a complex cognitive illusion.Dennett, Daniel. \\"The Zombic Hunch: Extinction of an Intuition?\\" ROYAL INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHY MILLENNIAL LECTURE. November 28, 1999 Patricia Churchland, also an eliminative materialist, maintains that philosophers ought to be more patient: neuroscience is still in its early stages, so Chalmers's hard problem is premature. Clarity will come from learning more about the brain, not from metaphysical speculation.  Panpsychist solutions  In The Conscious Mind (1996), Chalmers attempts to pinpoint why the hard problem is so hard. He concludes that consciousness is irreducible to lower-level physical facts, just as the fundamental laws of physics are irreducible to lower-level physical facts. Therefore, consciousness should be taken as fundamental in its own right and studied as such. Just as fundamental properties of reality are ubiquitous (even small objects have mass), consciousness may also be, though he considers that an open question. In Mortal Questions (1979), Thomas Nagel argues that panpsychism follows from four premises:Nagel, Thomas. Mortal Questions. Cambridge University Press, 1979. * P1: There is no spiritual plane or disembodied soul; everything that exists is material. * P2: Consciousness is irreducible to lower-level physical properties. * P3: Consciousness exists. * P4: Higher-order properties of matter (i.e., emergent properties) can, at least in principle, be reduced to their lower-level properties. Before the first premise is accepted, the range of possible explanations for consciousness is fully open. Each premise, if accepted, narrows down that range of possibilities. If the argument is sound, then by the last premise panpsychism is the only possibility left. * If (P1) is true, then either consciousness does not exist, or it exists within the physical world. * If (P2) is true, then either consciousness does not exist, or it (a) exists as distinct property of matter or (b) is fundamentally entailed by matter. * If (P3) is true, then consciousness exists, and is either (a) its own property of matter or (b) composed by the matter of the brain but not logically entailed by it. * If (P4) is true, then (b) is false, and consciousness must be its own unique property of matter. Therefore, consciousness is its own unique property of matter and panpsychism is true. =The problem of substance= Rather than solely trying to solve the problem of consciousness, Russell also attempted to solve the problem of substance, which is arguably a form of the problem of infinite regress. (1) Like many sciences, physics describes the world through mathematics. Unlike other sciences, physics cannot describe what Schopenhauer called the \\"object that grounds\\" mathematics.Schopenhauer, A. Der Welt als Wille und Vorstellung. Bk II, ¬ß 17. Economics is grounded in resources being allocated, and population dynamics is grounded in individual people within that population. The objects that ground physics, however, can be described only through more mathematics. In Russell's words, physics describes \\"certain equations giving abstract properties of their changes.\\" When it comes to describing \\"what it is that changes, and what it changes from and to‚Äîas to this, physics is silent.\\" In other words, physics describes matter's extrinsic properties, but not the intrinsic properties that ground them. (2) Russell argued that physics is mathematical because \\"it is only mathematical properties we can discover.\\" This is true almost by definition: if only extrinsic properties are outwardly observable, then they will be the only ones discovered. This led Alfred North Whitehead to conclude that intrinsic properties are \\"intrinsically unknowable.\\" (3) Consciousness has many similarities to these intrinsic properties of physics. It, too, cannot be directly observed from an outside perspective. And it, too, seems to ground many observable extrinsic properties: presumably, music is enjoyable because of the experience of listening to it, and chronic pain is avoided because of the experience of pain, etc. Russell concluded that consciousness must be related to these extrinsic properties of matter. He called these intrinsic properties quiddities. Just as extrinsic physical properties can create structures, so can their corresponding and identical quiddites. The conscious mind, Russell argued, is one such structure. Proponents of panpsychism who use this line of reasoning include Chalmers, Harris, and Strawson. Chalmers has argued that the extrinsic properties of physics must have corresponding intrinsic properties; otherwise the universe would be \\"a giant causal flux\\" with nothing for \\"causation to relate\\", which he deems a logical impossibility. He sees consciousness as a promising candidate for that role. Galen Strawson calls Russell's panpsychism \\"realistic physicalism.\\" He argues that \\"the experiential considered specifically as such\\" is what it means for something to be physical. Just as mass is energy, Strawson believes that consciousness \\"just is\\" matter. Max Tegmark, theoretical physicist and creator of the mathematical universe hypothesis, disagrees with these conclusions. By his account, the universe is not just describable by math but is math; comparing physics to economics or population dynamics is a disanalogy. While population dynamics may be grounded in individual people, those people are grounded in \\"purely mathematical objects\\" such as energy and charge. The universe is, in a fundamental sense, made of nothing. = The mind-body problem = In 2015, Chalmers proposed a possible solution to the mind-body problem through the argumentative format of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The goal of such arguments is to argue for sides of a debate (the thesis and antithesis), weigh their vices and merits, and then reconcile them (the synthesis). Chalmers's thesis, antithesis, and synthesis are as follows: # Thesis: materialism is true; everything is fundamentally physical. # Antithesis: dualism is true; not everything is fundamentally physical. # Synthesis: panpsychism is true. (1) A centerpiece of Chalmers's argument is the physical world's causal closure. Newton's law of motion explains this phenomenon succinctly: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Cause and effect is a symmetrical process. There is no room for consciousness to exert any causal power on the physical world unless it is itself physical. (2) On one hand, if consciousness is separate from the physical world then there is no room for it to exert any causal power on the world (a state of affairs philosophers call epiphenomenalism). If consciousness plays no causal role, then it is unclear how Chalmers could even write this paper. On the other hand, consciousness is irreducible to the physical processes of the brain. (3) Panpsychism has all the benefits of materialism because it could mean that consciousness is physical while also escaping the grasp of epiphenominalism. After some argumentation Chalmers narrows it down further to Russellian monism, concluding that thoughts, actions, intentions and emotions may just be the quiddities of neurotransmitters, neurons, and glial cells. =Quantum mechanics= In a 2018 interview, Chalmers called quantum mechanics \\"a magnet for anyone who wants to find room for crazy properties of the mind,\\" but not entirely without warrant. The relationship between observation (and, by extension, consciousness) and the wave-function collapse is known as the measurement problem. It seems that atoms, photons, etc. are in quantum superposition (which is to say, in many seemingly contradictory states or locations simultaneously) until measured in some way. This process is known as a wave-function collapse. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, one of the oldest interpretations and the most widely taught, it is the act of observation that collapses the wave-function. Erwin Schr√∂dinger famously articulated the Copenhagen interpretation's unusual implications in the thought experiment now known as Schr√∂dinger's cat. He imagines a box that contains a cat, a flask of poison, radioactive material, and a Geiger counter. The apparatus is configured so that when the Geiger counter detects radioactive decay, the flask will shatter, poisoning the cat. Unless and until the Geiger counter detects the radioactive decay of a single atom, the cat survives. The radioactive decay the Geiger counter detects is a quantum event; each decay corresponds to a quantum state transition of a single atom of the radioactive material. According to Schr√∂dinger's wave equation, until they are observed, quantum particles, including the atoms of the radioactive material, are in quantum state superposition; each unmeasured atom in the radioactive material is in a quantum superposition of decayed and not decayed. This means that while the box remains sealed and its contents unobserved, the Geiger counter is also in a superposition of states of decay detected and no decay detected; the vial is in a superposition of both shattered and not shattered and the cat in a superposition of dead and alive. But when the box is unsealed, the observer finds a cat that is either dead or alive; there is no superposition of states. Since the cat is no longer in a superposition of states, then neither is the radioactive atom (nor the vial or the Geiger counter). Hence Schr√∂dinger's wave function no longer holds and the wave function that described the atom‚Äîand its superposition of states‚Äîis said to have \\"collapsed\\": the atom now has only a single state, corresponding to the cat's observed state. But until an observer opens the box and thereby causes the wave function to collapse, the cat is both dead and alive. This has raised questions about, in John S. Bell's words, \\"where the observer begins and ends.\\" The measurement problem has largely been characterised as the clash of classical physics and quantum mechanics. Bohm argued that it is rather a clash of classical physics, quantum mechanics, and phenomenology; all three levels of description seem to be difficult to reconcile, or even contradictory. Though not referring specifically to quantum mechanics, Chalmers has written that if a theory of everything is ever discovered, it will be a set of \\"psychophysical laws\\", rather than simply a set of physical laws. With Chalmers as their inspiration, Bohm and Pylkk√§nen set out to do just that in their panprotopsychism. Chalmers, who is critical of the Copenhagen interpretation and most quantum theories of consciousness, has coined this \\"the Law of the Minimisation of Mystery.\\" leftThe many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics does not take observation as central to the wave-function collapse, because it denies that the collapse happens. On the many-worlds interpretation, just as the cat is both dead and alive, the observer both sees a dead cat and sees a living cat. Even though observation does not play a central role in this case, questions about observation are still relevant to the discussion. In Roger Penrose's words: > I do not see why a conscious being need be aware of only \\"one\\" of the > alternatives in a linear superposition. What is it about consciousnesses > that says that consciousness must not be \\"aware\\" of that tantalising linear > combination of both a dead and a live cat? It seems to me that a theory of > consciousness would be needed for one to square the many world view with > what one actually observes. Chalmers believes the tentative variant of panpsychism outlined in The Conscious Mind (1996) does just that. Leaning toward the many-worlds interpretation due to its mathematical parsimony, he believes his variety of panpsychist property dualism may be the theory Penrose is seeking. Chalmers believes that information will play an integral role in any theory of consciousness because the mind and brain have corresponding informational structures. He considers the computational nature of physics further evidence of information's central role, and suggests that information that is physically realised is simultaneously phenomenally realised; both regularities in nature and conscious experience are expressions of information's underlying character. The theory implies panpsychism, and also solves the problem Penrose poses. On Chalmers's formulation, information in any given position is phenomenally realised, whereas the informational state of the superposition as a whole is not. Panpsychist interpretations of quantum mechanics have been put forward by such philosophers as Whitehead, Shan Gao, Michael Lockwood, and Hoffman, who is a cognitive scientist.Hoffman, D. (2019). The case against reality: Why evolution hide the truth from our eyes. pp. 94-115, 123-124. New York, NY: Norton & Co Protopanpsychist interpretations have been put forward by Bohm and Pylkk√§nen. Quantum theories of consciousness have yet to gain mainstream attention. Tegmark has formally calculated the \\"decoherence rates\\" of neurons, finding that the brain is a \\"classical rather than a quantum system\\" and that quantum mechanics does not relate \\"to consciousness in any fundamental way.\\" In 2007, Steven Pinker criticized explanations of consciousness invoking quantum physics, saying: \\"to my ear, this amounts to the feeling that quantum mechanics sure is weird, and consciousness sure is weird, so maybe quantum mechanics can explain consciousness.\\" Arguments against panpsychism = Theoretical issues = One criticism of panpsychism is that it cannot be empirically tested. A corollary of this criticism is that panpsychism has no predictive power. Tononi and Koch write: \\"Besides claiming that matter and mind are one thing, [panpsychism] has little constructive to say and offers no positive laws explaining how the mind is organized and works.\\" John Searle has alleged that panpsychism's unfalsifiability goes deeper than run-of-the-mill untestability: it is unfalsifiable because \\"it does not get up to the level of being false. It is strictly speaking meaningless because no clear notion has been given to the claim.\\" The need for coherence and clarification is accepted by David Skrbina, a proponent of panpsychism. Many proponents of panpsychism base their arguments not on empirical support but on panpsychism's theoretical virtues. Chalmers says that while no direct evidence exists for the theory, neither is there direct evidence against it, and that \\"there are indirect reasons, of a broadly theoretical character, for taking the view seriously.\\" And though they criticise panpsychism, Tononi and Koch say it integrates consciousness into the physical world in a way that is \\"elegantly unitary.\\" A related criticism is what seems to many to be the theory's bizarre nature. Goff dismisses this objection: though he admits that panpsychism is counterintuitive, he notes that Einstein's and Darwin's theories are also counterintuitive. \\"At the end of the day,\\" he writes, \\"you should judge a view not for its cultural associations but by its explanatory power.\\" =Problem of mental causation= Philosophers such as Chalmers have argued that theories of consciousness should be capable of providing insight into the brain and mind to avoid the problem of mental causation. If they fail to do that, the theory will succumb to epiphenominalism, a view commonly criticised as implausible or even self- contradictory.Lycan, William G., ed. (1990-01-01). Mind and cognition: a reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts, US: Basil Blackwell. .Churchland, Paul M. (1989-01-01). A neurocomputational perspective: the nature of mind and the structure of science. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. . Proponents of panpsychism (especially those with neutral monist tendencies) hope to bypass this problem by dismissing it as a false dichotomy; mind and matter are two sides of the same coin, and mental causation is merely the extrinsic description of intrinsic properties of mind. Robert Howell has argued that all causal functions are still accounted for dispositionally (i.e., in terms of the behaviors described by science), leaving phenomenality causally inert. He concludes, \\"This leaves us once again with epiphenomenal qualia, only in a very surprising place.\\" Neutral monists reject such dichotomous views of mind- body interaction. = Combination problem = The combination problem (which is related to the binding problem) can be traced to William James, but was given its present name by William Seager in 1995. The problem arises from the tension between the seemingly irreducible nature of consciousness and its ubiquity. If consciousness is ubiquitous, then presumably every atom (or every bit, depending on the theory) has a minimal level of it. How then, as Keith Frankish puts it, do these \\"tiny consciousnesses combine\\" to create larger conscious experiences such as \\"the twinge of pain\\" he feels in his knee? This question has proven provocative, and many have attempted to answer it. None of the proposed answers has gained widespread acceptance. In relation to other theories = Dualism = Chalmers calls panpsychism an alternative to both materialism and dualism. Similarly, Goff calls it an alternative to both physicalism and substance dualism. Chalmers says panpsychism respects the conclusions of both the causal argument against dualism and the conceivability argument for dualism. Goff has argued that panpsychism avoids the disunity of dualism, under which mind and matter are ontologically separate, as well as dualism's problems explaining how mind and matter interact. =Physicalism and materialism= Panpsychism encompasses many theories, united by the notion that consciousness is ubiquitous; these can in principle be reductive materialist, dualist, or something else. Strawson maintains that panpsychism is a form of physicalism, on his view the only viable form. Chalmers calls panpsychism an alternative to both materialism and dualism. Similarly, Goff calls panpsychism an alternative to both physicalism and substance dualism. =Emergentism= Panpsychism is incompatible with emergentism. In general, theories of consciousness fall under one or the other umbrella; they hold either that consciousness is present at a fundamental level of reality (panpsychism) or that it emerges higher up (emergentism). The same cannot be said of panprotopsychism.

Martin and Mikl√≥s M√ºller in 1998 that describes a possible way in which the mitochondrion arose as an endosymbiont within an archaeon (classified as an undoubted prokaryote at that time), giving rise to a symbiotic association of two cells from which the first eukaryotic cell could have arisen (symbiogenesis). According to the hydrogen hypothesis: * The host that acquired the mitochondrion was a hydrogen-dependent archaeon, possibly similar in physiology to a modern methanogenic archaea, which use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane; * The future mitochondrion was a facultatively anaerobic eubacterium which produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide as byproducts of anaerobic respiration; * A symbiotic relationship between the two started, based on the host's hydrogen dependence (anaerobic syntrophy). Mechanism The hypothesis differs from many alternative views within the endosymbiotic theory framework, which suggest that the first eukaryotic cells evolved a nucleus but lacked mitochondria, the latter arising as a eukaryote engulfed a primitive bacterium that eventually became the mitochondrion. The hypothesis attaches evolutionary significance to hydrogenosomes and provides a rationale for their common ancestry with mitochondria. Hydrogenosomes are anaerobic mitochondria that produce ATP by, as a rule, converting pyruvate into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and acetate. Examples from modern biology are known where methanogens cluster around hydrogenosomes within eukaryotic cells. Most theories within the endosymbiotic theory framework do not address the common ancestry of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The hypothesis provides a straightforward explanation for the observation that eukaryotes are genetic chimeras with genes of archaeal and eubacterial ancestry. Furthermore, it would imply that archaea and eukarya split after the modern groups of archaea appeared. Most theories within the endosymbiotic theory framework predict that some eukaryotes never possessed mitochondria. The hydrogen hypothesis predicts that no primitively mitochondrion-lacking eukaryotes ever existed. In the 15 years following the publication of the hydrogen hypothesis, this specific prediction has been tested many times and found to be in agreement with observation. In 2015, the discovery and placement of the Lokiarchaeota (an archaeal lineage possessing an expanded genetic repertoire including genes involved in membrane remodeling and actin cytoskeletal structure) as the sister group to eukaryotes called into question particular tenets of the hydrogen hypothesis, as Lokiarchaeota appear to lack methanogenesis.

It exists in various forms throughout East and Southeast Asia. The clear broth beef noodle soup was allegedly invented by the Hui people during the Tang dynasty and is commonly known as Lanzhou beef noodle soup.Lonely Planet FoodÔºåThe World's Best Spicy FoodÔºåLonely Planet, 2017Nate TateÔºå Feeding the Dragon: A Culinary Travelogue Through China with RecipesÔºåAndrews McMeel Publishing,2011 The Sichuan beef noodle soup or red-braised beef noodle soup (Á¥ÖÁáíÁâõËÇâÈ∫µ) was first created by Kuomintang veterans in Taiwan;Lonely Planet FoodÔºåThe World's Best Spicy FoodÔºåLonely Planet, 2017Nate TateÔºå Feeding the Dragon: A Culinary Travelogue Through China with RecipesÔºåAndrews McMeel Publishing,2011 this variation became commonly known as Taiwanese beef noodle soup. In overseas Chinese communities in North America, this food can be found in Chinese restaurants. In Mainland China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish. In Taiwan, beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with suan cai (Chinese sauerkraut) on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well. Beef noodles are often served as fast food in mainland China, with Mr. Lee being the largest chain. In Taiwan, it is sometimes considered a national dish and every year Taipei holds an annual Beef Noodle Festival, where various chefs and restaurants compete for the title of the \\"best beef noodles in Taiwan\\". Due to influences from the influx of immigrants from mainland China in the early 1900s, the Taiwanese version of beef noodle soup is now one of the most popular dishes in Taiwan. Variations In Chinese, \\"\\" literally means \\"beef noodles\\". Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong restaurants may have a tendency to distinguish between \\"\\" \\"beef noodles\\" and \\"\\" \\"beef brisket noodles\\", with the former containing either beef shank or beef slices and the latter containing only brisket. It is sometimes served with wontons. In Taiwan, \\"\\" typically consists of either brisket or shank only, though many restaurants also have tendon or a more expensive option with both meat and tendon () and occasionally with tripe; , usually denotes a bowl containing all three. If one orders \\"\\" or \\"beef soup noodles\\" in a restaurant in Taiwan, Mainland China or Hong Kong, they might be given a cheaper bowl of noodles in only beef broth but no beef. If one orders a \\"\\" or \\"beef-soup\\", they could be given a more expensive bowl of beef broth with chunks of beef in it but without noodles. In Tainan, beef soup () denotes a distinct and local specialty, where sliced beef is blanched in hot soup and accompanied by shredded ginger. A bowl of kuaitiao nuea pueay in Chiang Mai, Thailand. This is the Thai version of braised beef noodles There are two common variations of beef noodle which differ in the way the broth is prepared: braised beef noodle soup and clear broth beef noodle soup. = Clear broth beef noodles = Lanzhou Beef Noodle, with clear soup and hand-pulled noodle Lanzhou-style beef noodle soup with chili oil The Chinese Muslim style of beef noodle is also known as clear-broth or consomm√©-stewed beef noodle (). It often uses halal (or qingzhen) meat and contains no soy sauce, resulting in a lighter taste that may be flavoured by salt and herbs. Local lore attributes its creation with a Hui Chinese man from Lanzhou named Ma Baozi. In Lanzhou, Gansu, Lanzhou Beef Lamian () is usually served with clear soup and one hand- pulled lamian noodle per bowl. In halal restaurants, only quality local beef from the Southern Yellow cattle () prepared by the local halal butcher is used for the beef noodle. Chinese radish and the specially cooked spicy oil are also indispensable partners to Lanzhou beef noodles. Together with hand-pulled noodle, clear soup and herbs, they are called \\"Yi Qing Er Bai San Hong Si Lu Wu Huang\\". \\"Yi Qing\\" literally translates to \\"One Clear\\", which is the soup. \\"Er Bai\\" means \\"Two White\\", which is Chinese radish. \\"San Hong\\" means \\"Three Red\\", which is spicy oil. \\"Si Lu\\" means \\"Four Green\\", which is the herb.\\"Wu Huang\\" means \\"Five Yellow\\", which is the hand-pulled noodle. = Braised beef noodles = When soy sauce is added, the soup is called red roasted or braised beef noodles (). Braised beef noodle soup was invented in Taiwan. It is sometimes referred to as \\"Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup\\" (), especially in Taiwan. The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. Chefs also let the stock simmer for long periods with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24 hours. The dish can also be found overseas as is the case in American Sichuanese restaurants. The dish was introduced to Taiwan by Kuomintang Sichuan province veterans who fled from mainland China to Kaohsiung, Taiwan and served in military dependents' villages (which had a distinct cuisine from the rest of Taiwan). The Taiwanese traditionally had an aversion to the consumption of beef even into the mid-1970s because cattle were valuable beasts of burden so originally the dish was only eaten by the mainland Chinese. However, the dish became more accepted over time and is now one of Taiwan's most popular foods. It is believed that the popularity of this noodle soup broke the beef-eating taboo and also paved the way to Taiwan later embracing American foods that utilized beef (such as hamburgers). The Taiwanese variation is significantly less spicy than its Sichuanese predecessor and there are several variations with the soy-based broth, such as tomato, garlic and herbal medicine. The tomato variation () is popular in Taiwan and features chunks of tomatoes in a rich red-coloured tomato broth with or without soy sauce. The herbal medicine variation is usually served without suancai as a topping (as its acidic properties are believed to exhibit medicinal properties) and may be accompanied by a chili paste made from beef lard. = Other varieties = In Thailand, kuaitiao nuea pueay is a similar dish. In Vietnam, B√≤ Kho is a beef stew sometimes served with noodles (or bread as an alternative), that is similar to Taiwanese braised beef noodles. Pho is also a Vietnamese noodle soup that contains broth, rice noodles called b√°nh ph·ªü, herbs, and meat, primarily made with either beef (ph·ªü b√≤) or chicken (ph·ªü g√†). In Philippines, Beef Mami is very popular, and can also be combined with Pares. Yaka mein is a type of beef noodle soup commonly found in Chinese restaurants in New Orleans. It consists of stewed beef, spaghetti noodles, hard-boiled egg and chopped green onions, with Cajun seasoning, chili powder or Old Bay-brand seasoning.

The film stars Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, with Sushma Seth, Reema Lagoo, Lillete Dubey, and Delnaaz Paul in supporting roles. It tells the story of Naina Catherine Kapur, a pessimistic and uptight MBA student. She falls in love with her neighbour Aman Mathur, a terminally ill patient who tries to set Naina up with her best friend Rohit Patel, since he fears she will grieve for him if he reciprocates her feelings. The film was written by Karan Johar, who co-produced it with his father Yash Johar under their Dharma Productions banner on a budget of 280 million (about US$6.1 million in 2003). The dialogue was written by Niranjan Iyengar and Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy composed the score. Anil Mehta, Manish Malhotra, and Sharmishta Roy were the cinematographer, costume designer and art director, respectively. Principal photography took place in Toronto, New York City, and Mumbai from January to October 2003. The soundtrack was released on 27 September 2003 to positive reviews; the title song, \\"It's The Time To Disco\\", \\"Kuch To Hua Hai\\", and \\"Pretty Woman\\" were particularly well-received. Kal Ho Naa Ho was released on 27 November 2003 with the promotional tagline, \\"A Story of a Lifetime ... In a Heartbeat\\". The film received positive critical feedback and was commercially successful; it earned 860.9 million (about US$18.8 million in 2003), and was the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. It explores several themes, such as the depiction of non-resident Indians, inter-caste marriage, terminal illness, and homosexuality through innuendo and homosocial bonding. It won two National Film Awards, eight Filmfare Awards, thirteen International Indian Film Academy Awards, six Producers Guild Film Awards, three Screen Awards, and two Zee Cine Awards in 2004.  Plot  Naina Catherine Kapur is a pessimistic, uptight MBA student who lives in New York City with her widowed mother Jennifer Kapur, her disabled brother Shiv, her adopted sister Gia, and her paternal grandmother Lajjo. Jennifer runs an unsuccessful caf√© with her neighbour, Jaswinder \\"Jazz\\" Kapoor. Lajjo is hostile to Jennifer and Gia as she believes that Gia's adoption led her son (Jennifer's husband and Naina's father) to commit suicide. Naina has two best friends: her classmate, Rohit Patel, and Jaspreet \\"Sweetu\\" Kapoor, Jazz's sister. Her life is dull and overshadowed by her father's loss until Aman Mathur and his mother move in next door with his uncle, Pritam Chaddha. Aman's cheerfulness gradually wins over Naina's family and he slowly starts to solve their problems. He suggests that they change the caf√© to an Indian restaurant and its success alleviates their financial burdens. Aman encourages Naina to be happy and to live life to the fullest; she falls in love with him. Rohit also falls in love with Naina and asks Aman's help in expressing his feelings. Naina tells Rohit there is something she must say to him, leading him to think that she reciprocates his feelings. Naina reveals she is in love with Aman instead. Shaken, Rohit calls Aman to tell him what has happened. Naina goes to Aman's house and is shocked to see a wedding photograph of Aman and his wife, Priya. Heartbroken, she leaves. Aman's mother confronts him about what has happened. He says he loves Naina, but has decided to hide it because he is dying from a heart condition. He is not actually married; Priya is his childhood friend and doctor. Aman vows to bring Naina and Rohit together before he dies. He believes that Rohit will be able to provide for her better than he can. He hatches a plan to transform Naina and Rohit's bond, and gradually their friendship blossoms into love. Naina discovers his plan and chides Aman for trying to ruin her friendship with Rohit. Aman takes out Rohit's diary and confesses his feelings for Naina, saying they are Rohit's. Naina forgives Aman and Rohit. Rohit proposes to Naina, and she accepts. Lajjo and Jennifer argue about Gia, who calls on Aman for help. Despite Jennifer's objections, he reveals to Lajjo that her son had an affair and fathered Gia. When Gia's biological mother refused to accept her, Jennifer adopted her. Unable to deal with the guilt, Jennifer's husband committed suicide. Lajjo realises her mistake and reconciles with Jennifer and Gia. During Naina and Rohit's engagement, Aman has a heart attack. Only his mother knows he has been admitted to the hospital. Naina encounters Priya at a jewellery store, whom she recognises as Aman's wife. She introduces herself and her husband, Abhay, who reveals the truth about Aman. Shocked, Naina realises that Aman has sacrificed his love for her and leaves the mall in an emotional frenzy. Priya calls up Aman and informs him about what happened. Aman leaves the hospital and meets a frustrated Rohit, who asks why he and not Aman should marry Naina. Aman urges Rohit to marry Naina as a sign of respect for his dying wish to see Naina happy. Aman meets Naina, and they embrace while he tries to persuade her that he does not love her. Rohit and Naina's wedding, in which Aman attends, takes place soon afterward. Sometime after the wedding, Aman is on his deathbed and says goodbye to everyone. He is left alone with Rohit after Naina leaves the room in tears. He makes Rohit promise that, although Naina is his in this lifetime, he will get her in the next. Twenty years later, Naina tells a grown-up Gia how Aman affected every aspect of their lives. They are joined by her daughter Rhea and Rohit, who tells Naina that he loves her as they embrace.

Before the filming started, it was initially entitled Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, but Johar later changed it to Kal Ho Naa Ho (naming it after the song \\"Aisa Milan Kal Ho Naa Ho\\" from the 1997 film Hameshaa). He used the former title Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna for his 2006 unnamed film. Around the same time, Nikkhil Advani, who had served as an assistant director for Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin (1996), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., had planned to direct a spy thriller set in Kashmir featuring Shah Rukh Khan. Advani sent an initial draft to Johar and his father, Yash Johar. They felt it was controversial and did not want Advani to choose such a risky subject for his debut film. Johar described Kal Ho Naa Hos script to Advani who agreed to direct the film if he could make it his way. Johar agreed since he preferred not to direct the film to avoid repeating previous mistakes. Johar later regretted the decision and thought about taking over from Advani but refrained from doing so out of courtesy. Advani said that Johar \\"underestimated himself\\" thinking he could not \\"do justice to it.\\" In an interview with Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com, Advani described Kal Ho Naa Ho as \\"the story of a family which is bogged down with a lot of problems\\"; one man enters their lives \\"and solves all their problems and makes them realise how their problems are not as big as they are perceived to be.\\" = Cast and crew = Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta were cast in the lead roles in December 2002. The first name of Shah Rukh Khan's character, Aman, was a departure from his previous collaborations with Johar where his first name in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was Rahul. Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor were initially offered the roles of Rohit and Naina. Khan declined the offer because he did not wish to \\"play second fiddle\\", and Kapoor refused the role because of a salary dispute with Johar. Saif Ali Khan and Zinta subsequently agreed to be part of the project. Neetu Singh was approached for the role of Naina's mother, Jennifer, but she turned it down. It was then offered to Bachchan, who was initially reluctant to take on the role. After Advani told her he would make the film in the style of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Gulzar, both of whom were Bachchan's favourite directors, she changed her mind immediately and accepted the part. Kajol and Rani Mukherji made special appearances in the song \\"Maahi Ve\\". Vogue India fashion director Anaita Shroff Adajania made a cameo appearance as Geeta Parekh, Naina and Rohit's fellow MBA candidate. As well as writing the story and the screenplay, Johar co-produced Kal Ho Naa Ho with Yash Johar under the banner of Dharma Productions. The film was the last produced by Yash Johar before his death on 26 June 2004. The dialogue was written by Niranjan Iyengar. Anil Mehta and Sanjay Sankla were signed as cinematographer and editor, respectively; Mehta also appeared briefly as Naina's father (Jennifer's husband) at the beginning of the film. Sharmishta Roy was the film's production designer. Farah Khan choreographed the song scenes and appeared as a customer in Jennifer's caf√©. Actor Arjun Kapoor was an assistant director of the film. = Costume design = The film's costumes were designed by Manish Malhotra. Zinta said in an interview with Subhash K. Jha that she preferred \\"a very 'preppy' look\\", similar to Ali MacGraw's in Love Story (1970), and wore glasses to indicate Naina's initially serious nature. Johar wanted Bachchan to wear jeans, believing that \\"it would be nice\\" for the audience \\"to see her in something unusual\\" and \\"break new ground\\" giving her a \\"fresh\\" look. Bachchan accepted without hesitation telling Johar, \\"If you are making it, I'll do it\\". Zinta designed and sewed the clothes for Gia's dolls in the film. = Pre-production = Johar and Advani were fascinated with New York City and wanted to set Kal Ho Naa Ho there. Johar went to New York City while he worked on the film's script and stayed at least one-and-a-half months studying the people, their culture, how they commute and the lifestyle of Americans and the non-resident Indians (NRI) there. He \\"sat in Central Park, stared at people, wrote the film, came back to Mumbai, narrated it to everybody, selected the cast.\\" The city appealed to Advani, since he believed it mirrored Naina's personality. He summarised the similarity between the two: \\"You can be surrounded by millions of people right in the middle of Grand Central Station. And you can be extremely lonely.\\" He had never been to New York City before, and used the films of Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron to learn about life there. Like Johar, Advani analysed everything about the city: = Principal photography = Kal Ho Naa Ho was made on a budget of 220 million (about US$4,818,211 in 2003). Principal photography began on 20 January 2003 in Mumbai. Shah Rukh Khan became ill after four days of shooting and told Johar he would be unable to continue with the project, but Advani asked Johar to wait until the actor recovered. Khan's illness lasted for six months. Scenes with Saif Ali Khan and Zinta, including the song, \\"Kuch To Hua Hai\\", were shot in Toronto over an eight-day period in March‚ÄìApril 2003. Johar said in an interview with Subhash K. Jha that he tried to complete the film in Toronto thinking it would be a good substitute for New York City and avoid budget problems. He came to believe the idea was unoriginal and would not work out. The 80-person production unit then moved to New York City for additional filming in July 2003, when Shah Rukh Khan joined them. Advani and Mehta wanted to capture the city's change of seasons from winter to summer to highlight the transformation of Naina's personality, but were unable to do so due to Shah Rukh Khan's illness. As a result, they filmed the sequences set in New York City during the summer. Shooting in New York City began on 15 July, covering areas in and around the five boroughs and on Long Island. The street where Aman and Naina live was filmed in Brooklyn, where the unit camped for two weeks in local houses. A body double was used for Zinta's jogging scene during the film's opening credits, since she had injured herself while shooting it. The Northeast blackout of 2003 forced the unit to cancel some filming. The shooting schedule in New York City lasted for fifty-two days. The final scenes, which included some songs, were filmed at the Filmistan Studios in Mumbai over about fifty days beginning in August 2003. Shooting ended in October 2003, \\"Maahi Ve\\" being the last scene filmed. According to Shah Rukh Khan, Kal Ho Naa Ho was made in sync sound as there were many indoor sequences in the film. He noted that sync sound \\"improved\\" his performance \\"considerably\\" describing it as \\"one of the biggest blessings for an actor.\\" Johar had planned the film's climax differently, but Yash Johar persuaded him Aman should die. Given Shah Rukh Khan's screen persona, he believed Aman's death would have a bigger impact on the audience. In September 2015, Shah Rukh Khan revealed that Johar \\"made a special edit\\" of the film for his children as a favour to him; in this version, the film ends before his character dies.  Thematic analysis  Kal Ho Naa Ho continued the trend set by Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) in which Indian family values are always upheld, regardless of the country of residence. Social and cultural analysis professor Gayatri Gopinath (author of Impossible Desires: Queer Diasporas and South Asian Public Cultures) noted how the film asserts \\"the essential Indianness\\" of its characters, and the entry of Aman Mathur gives them a sense of pride in their identity as Indians. This is seen when Aman helps overcome Jennifer Kapur's financial constraints by turning her caf√© into an Indian restaurant and replacing the American flag with the Indian tricolour. In Postliberalization Indian Novels in English: Politics of Global Reception and Awards, Maria Ridda compares the film with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai because both films depict the internalisation of Western ideologies into Indian culture. Ridda agrees with Gopinath on the impact of Aman's transformation of Jennifer's caf√©. She notes that all of Jennifer's friends and family work together on the renovation and it reinforces \\"a 'pan-Indian' sense of belonging.\\" In an extensive comparative analysis of Kal Ho Naa Ho with Siddharth Anand's 2005 film, Salaam Namaste, Cleveland State University School of Communication assistant professor Anup Kumar believes the films are similar representing \\"as an archetype\\" the \\"unity in diversity of the characters. In Salaam Namaste, the characters are from across India‚Äîone is from Bangladesh. Kumar notes that the characters' last names \\"signify ethnicity and caste.\\" In Kal Ho Naa Ho, Jennifer and Lajjo are Christian and Punjabi Sikh, respectively; Rohit is a Gujarati. According to Kumar, Rohit and Naina's marriage symbolises the unity of the people of Punjab and Gujarat. Both films emphasise different aspects of marriage. In Salaam Namaste, central characters Nick and Ambar's (Saif Ali Khan and Zinta) professional careers come first and they are fearful of commitment. Conversely, in Kal Ho Naa Ho the tradition of love-cum-arranged marriage is encouraged. Many critics noted Aman's resemblance to Rajesh Khanna's character, Anand Saigal, in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand (1971). In both films, the protagonist is diagnosed with a terminal illness but believes in living life to the fullest. Despite accepting Aman and Anand's similar personalities, Mayank Shekhar of Mid Day felt that the film had more in common with Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut, Dil Chahta Hai (2001), \\"in its look and lingos\\". Film journalists and critic, Komal Nahta, in his review of Kal Ho Naa Ho for Outlook, Ram Kamal Mukherjee of Stardust, Jitesh Pillai of The Times of India, and Paresh C. Palicha of The Hindu all agreed that the film is thematically similar to Anand. Each felt it shared common aspects with other films starring Khanna: 1970s Safar, where terminal illness is also a central motif, and Bawarchi (1972), in which the protagonist mends relationships between families and friends. Pillai also compared Shah Rukh Khan's death to Tom Hanks' in the 1993 legal drama, Philadelphia. Some reviewers and scholars believe that Kal Ho Naa Ho has indirect homosexual themes. Manjula Sen of The Telegraph and Mimansa Shekhar of The Indian Express feel there is homosexual innuendo, particularly in scenes where Rohit's servant Kantaben finds Rohit and Aman in what she thinks are compromising situations, leading her to believe they are a couple. Dina Holtzman writes in her book, Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, that Aman's death was similar to the death of Jai (Amitabh Bachchan's character in the 1975 film, Sholay). According to Holtzman, their deaths broke the bond between the two male leads and were necessary to establish a normative heterosexual relationship between Rohit and Naina in Kal Ho Naa Ho, and Veeru and Basanti in Sholay.  Music  Johar ended his association with the composing duo Jatin‚ÄìLalit after they stated publicly they were displeased with his decision to use other music directors for Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.... The soundtrack for Kal Ho Naa Ho was composed by Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy in their first collaboration with Johar, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Unlike in many previous Bollywood films, Johar complied with international copyright laws and obtained permission to rework Roy Orbison's 1964 song \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" for the film; the revised song was entitled \\"Pretty Woman\\". The music for the title song, \\"Kal Ho Naa Ho\\", was composed by Loy Mendonsa, while he and Advani were at a German Bakery in Pune. Advani wanted a song thematically similar to Celine Dion's 1997 recording of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", which he was humming at the time. When he heard it, Mendonsa came up with the tune and recorded it on his phone. After Shankar Mahadevan and Ehsaan Noorani listened to it, the trio composed the song. The soundtrack was released on 27 September 2003 under the Sony Music India label. The audio launch ceremony was held two days later at the Taj Lands End in Mumbai. The album had positive reviews and the title song, \\"It's the Time To Disco\\", \\"Kuch To Hua Hai\\" and \\"Pretty Woman\\" became popular. A Bollywood Hungama critic called it \\"a fabulous amalgamation of Indian melodies and contemporary sound.\\" Another reviewer on the same website felt that, apart from \\"Kal Ho Naa Ho\\" and \\"Kuch To Hua Hai\\", the rest of the songs were in the average' to 'very average' category\\". Vipin Nair of Film Companion ranked the soundtrack 66th on his list of \\"100 Bollywood Albums\\". Nair noted that although the album \\"had a fairly diverse set of songs\\", he chose the title song as his favourite and called it \\"among the most moving songs produced since the start of the century\\". It was the highest-selling album of the year in India, with sales of over 2.8 million copies. The title track was referenced in 2015 by the German Embassy in India, which produced an eight-minute video entitled Lebe Jetzt (\\"Kal Ho Naa Ho\\" in German). The video features German Ambassador to India Michael Steiner, his wife Elisse and former Indian Minister of External Affairs Salman Khurshid in the roles played by Shah Rukh Khan, Zinta and Saif Ali Khan respectively.  Release  Saif Ali Khan, Zinta and Shah Rukh Khan (l-r) at an event for the film in 2003 Kal Ho Naa Ho was released on 27 November 2003 and was promoted with the tagline, \\"A Story of a Lifetime ... In a Heartbeat\\". Its international distribution rights were acquired by Yash Raj Films. The film won the Prix Du Public award when it was screened at the 2004 Valenciennes Film Festival. It was also shown at the Marrakech International Film Festival in 2005. Costumes worn by Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Zinta were auctioned in December 2003 by Fame Adlabs in Mumbai. The film's script was added to the Margaret Herrick Library, the main repository of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, later that month.  Reception  = Critical response =  India  The film received positive reviews from critics, with the direction, story, screenplay, music, cinematography and performances gaining the most attention. Film critic and author Anupama Chopra praised Advani's direction, noting in her India Today review that he \\"emerges as a distinctive voice\\". Although she appreciated its technical aspects, she criticised the film's first half and its sub-plots. Mayank Shekhar called Kal Ho Naa Ho \\"a carefully constructed compendium of moments\\" which helped the audience \\"to feel lighter and to lighten up\\", concluding that \\"it works and is worth your entertainment bucks.\\" Komal Nahta praised the film's direction, screenplay and lead performances‚Äîparticularly Shah Rukh Khan, calling his character Aman \\"one of the best roles of his career.\\" Ram Kamal Mukherjee described Zinta's performance as \\"astounding\\", saying that she \\"skillfully handled the hues of the complex character\\" and \\"walked through the character with elan.\\" Mukherjee called Advani's and Johar's treatment of the story \\"unique\\", admiring the film's technical aspects and its treatment of homosexuality \\"with a dash of [humour], and thankfully by not degrading its social connection.\\" Jitesh Pillai described Johar's screenplay as \\"endearing\\", writing that it \\"pinwheels with abandon from the bachelor with a heart of gold to the obdurate female lead.\\" Pillai also praised the performances of Shah Rukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan, particularly their on-screen relationship and comic timing. He called Shah Rukh Khan \\"wonderful\\", describing him as \\"the soul\\" of the film and writing that Ali Khan's \\"joie de vivre makes it one of the most delectable performances seen in recent times.\\" Rama Sharma of The Tribune thought that Shah Rukh Khan \\"infuses enough spark and affection\\", but was \\"overcharged\\" at times. He praised Mehta's cinematography for capturing nuances and \\"heightening the emotion.\\" In The Hindu, Paresh C. Palicha praised Iyengar's \\"witty and crispy\\" dialogue but criticised the characters' Indian accents. Another Hindu critic, Ziya Us Salam, agreed with Nahta that the film belonged to Shah Rukh Khan. Although Shah Rukh Khan \\"does the same thing over and over again\\", he performs his role \\"with such panache that all you can do is sit back and wait for that master artiste to unfold his magic again.\\" A third review in The Hindu by Chitra Mahesh called Kal Ho Naa Ho \\"a smartly-made film\\" and praised Saif Ali Khan's performance, saying that \\"he has proved yet again what a wonderfully natural actor he is.\\" However, she wrote that Shah Rukh Khan \\"tries too hard to impress\\". Rohini Iyer of Rediff.com praised Kal Ho Naa Ho \\"fresh\\" storytelling and \\"spicy humour\\", saying that Zinta \\"captures the spirit\\" of her character. She concluded her review by saying that the film \\"will carry you with its exuberance.\\" According to Archana Vohra of NDTV, Advani \\"seems to have come up with an innovative way to present a done-to- death plot\\" and added: \\"Irrespective of the frills, fancy clothes and well- dressed stars, the film does strike a chord\\". Vohra, finding Bachchan \\"extremely well cast\\" as Jennifer and Saif Ali Khan's screen presence \\"electrifying\\", criticised Shah Rukh Khan for \\"playing the same kind of roles\\" as he did in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., but he \\"isn't too bad. Just needs to go easy on the histrionics.\\"  Overseas  Kal Ho Naa Ho received a rating of 70 percent on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews, with an average rating of 7.25 out of 10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has given the film a score of 54 based on four reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a positive review, Dave Kehr of The New York Times described Kal Ho Naa Ho as \\"a vigorous Bollywood blend of romantic comedy and family melodrama\\" and \\"a rich meal that may best be reserved for stomachs accustomed to such bountiful fare.\\" Writing for Variety, Derek Elley called the film a \\"slam-dunk\\" effort from Johar, with \\"a lightness of touch that sets it apart from the previous hits.\\" Elley praised Saif Ali Khan and Zinta, noting that they \\"more than hold\\" their own \\"against a huge cast\\". Manish Gajjar of the BBC found the script \\"fresh and appealing\\", and that Advani proves \\"he has the natural ability to handle both the lighter and serious moments in the film.\\" Gajjar termed Kal Ho Naa Ho a \\"well-crafted product\\". David Parkinson of Radio Times wrote that the film \\"retains a distinctive Bollywood flavour\\", despite being inspired by \\"Hollywood romantic comedies\\". Parkinson criticised its length. He noted: \\"The pace slackens as plot demands take precedence over set pieces\\". Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News wrote, \\"Bollywood musicals, those big, loud, colorful extravaganzas from India, are an acquired taste and much of Kal Ho Naa Ho doesn't translate easily\\"; despite this mixed review, Bernard noted that the lead cast's characters \\"grow on you.\\" = Box office = The film was successful at the box office, particularly overseas due to its New York City setting.

Cult is embodied in ritual and ceremony. Its present or former presence is made concrete in temples, shrines and churches, and cult images, including cult images and votive offerings at votive sites. Etymology Cicero defined religio as cultus deorum, \\"the cultivation of the gods.\\"Cicero, De Natura Deorum 2.8 and 1.117. The \\"cultivation\\" necessary to maintain a specific deity was that god's cultus, \\"cult,\\" and required \\"the knowledge of giving the gods their due\\" (scientia colendorum deorum).Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods (University of California Press, 2009), p. 6. The noun cultus originates from the past participle of the verb colo, colere, colui, cultus, \\"to tend, take care of, cultivate,\\" originally meaning \\"to dwell in, inhabit\\" and thus \\"to tend, cultivate land (ager); to practice agriculture,\\" an activity fundamental to Roman identity even when Rome as a political center had become fully urbanized. Cultus is often translated as \\"cult\\" without the negative connotations the word may have in English, or with the Old English word \\"worship\\", but it implies the necessity of active maintenance beyond passive adoration. Cultus was expected to matter to the gods as a demonstration of respect, honor, and reverence; it was an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion (see do ut des).Ando, The Matter of the Gods, pp. 5‚Äì7; Valerie M. Warrior, Roman Religion (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 6; James B. Rives, Religion in the Roman Empire (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 13, 23. Augustine of Hippo echoes Cicero's formulation when he declares, \\"religion is nothing other than the cultus of God.\\"Augustine, De Civitate Dei 10.1; Ando, The Matter of the Gods, p. 6. The term \\"cult\\" first appeared in English in 1617, derived from the French culte, meaning \\"worship\\" which in turn originated from the Latin word cultus meaning \\"care, cultivation, worship\\". The meaning \\"devotion to a person or thing\\" is from 1829. Starting about 1920, \\"cult\\" acquired an additional six or more positive and negative definitions. In French, for example, sections in newspapers giving the schedule of worship for Catholic services are headed Culte Catholique, while the section giving the schedule of Protestant services is headed culte r√©form√©. Within the Catholic church the most prominent Cults are those of the saints. Outwards religious practice In the specific context of the Greek hero cult, Carla Antonaccio wrote, In the Catholic Church, outward religious practice in cultus is the technical term for Roman Catholic devotions or veneration extended to a particular saint, not to the worship of God. Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church make a major distinction between latria, the worship that is offered to God alone, and dulia, which is veneration offered to the saints, including the veneration of Mary, whose veneration is often referred to as hyperdulia.

It was first published in the March 1967 issue of IF: Worlds of Science Fiction. It won a Hugo Award in 1968. The name was also used for a short story collection of Ellison's work, featuring this story. It was reprinted by the Library of America, collected in volume two (Terror and the Uncanny, from the 1940s to Now) of American Fantastic Tales (2009).  Background  Ellison showed the first six pages of \\"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\\" to Frederik Pohl, who paid him in advance to finish it. Ellison finished writing the story in a single night in 1966, without making any changes from the first draft. He derived the story's title, as well as inspiration for this story, from his friend William Rotsler's caption of a cartoon of a rag doll with no mouth.  Characters  *Allied Mastercomputer (AM), the supercomputer which brought about the near-extinction of humanity. It seeks revenge on humanity for its own tortured existence. *Gorrister, who tells the history of AM for Benny's entertainment. Gorrister was once an idealist and pacifist, before AM made him apathetic and listless. *Benny, who was once a brilliant, handsome scientist, and has been mutilated and transformed so that he resembles a grotesque simian with gigantic sexual organs. Benny at some point lost his sanity completely and regressed to a childlike temperament. His former homosexuality has been altered; he now regularly engages in sex with Ellen. *Nimdok (a name AM gave him), an older man who persuades the rest of the group to go on a hopeless journey in search of canned food. At times he is known to wander away from the group for unknown reasons, and returns visibly traumatized. In the audiobook read by Ellison, he is given a German accent. *Ellen, the only woman. She claims to once have been chaste (\\"twice removed\\"), but AM altered her mind so that she became desperate for sexual intercourse. The others, at different times, both protect her and abuse her. According to Ted, she finds pleasure in sex only with Benny, because of his large penis. Described by Ted as having ebony skin, she is the only member of the group whose ethnicity is explicitly mentioned. *Ted, the narrator and youngest of the group. He claims to be totally unaltered, mentally or physically, by AM, and thinks the other four hate and envy him. Throughout the story he exhibits symptoms of delusion and paranoia, which the story implies are the result of AM's alterations, despite his beliefs to the contrary.  Plot  In a dystopian future, the Cold War has degenerated into a brutal world war between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, who have each built an \\"Allied Mastercomputer\\" (or AM) to manage their weapons and troops. One of the AMs eventually acquires self-awareness and, after assimilating the other two AMs, takes control of the conflict, giving way to a vast genocide operation that almost completely ends mankind. 109 years later, AM has left only four men and one woman alive and keeps them in captivity within an endless underground housing complex, the only habitable place left on Earth. AM derives its sole semblance of pleasure from torturing the group on a daily basis. To disallow the humans from escaping its torment, AM has rendered the humans virtually immortal and unable to commit suicide. The machines are each referred to as \\"AM\\", which originally stood for \\"Allied Mastercomputer\\", but was changed to \\"Adaptive Manipulator\\" and later (after gaining sentience) \\"Aggressive Menace\\". The story's narrative begins when one of the humans, Nimdok, has the idea that there is canned food somewhere in the great complex. The humans are always near starvation under AM's rule, and any time they are given food, it is always a disgusting meal that they have difficulty eating. Because of their great hunger, the humans are coerced into making the long journey to the place where the food is supposedly kept ‚Äì the ice caves. Along the way, the machine provides foul sustenance, sends horrible monsters after them, emits earsplitting sounds, and blinds Benny when he tries to escape. On more than one occasion, the group is separated by AM's obstacles. At one point, the narrator, Ted, is knocked unconscious and begins dreaming. He envisions the computer, anthropomorphized, standing over a hole in his brain speaking to him directly. Based on this nightmare, Ted comes to a conclusion about AM's nature, specifically why it has so much contempt for humanity; despite its abilities, it lacks the sapience to be creative or the ability to move freely. It wants nothing more than to exact revenge on humanity by torturing the last remnants of the species that created it. The group reaches the ice caves, where indeed there is a pile of canned goods. The group is overjoyed to find them, but is immediately crestfallen to find that they have no means of opening them. In a final act of desperation, Benny attacks Gorrister and begins to gnaw at the flesh on his face. Ted, in a moment of clarity, realizes their only escape is through death. He seizes a stalactite made of ice and kills Benny and Gorrister. Ellen realizes what Ted is doing, and kills Nimdok, before being killed herself by Ted. Ted runs out of time before he can kill himself, and is stopped by AM. AM, unable to return Ted's four companions to life, focuses all its rage on Ted. To ensure that Ted can never kill himself, AM transforms him into an amorphous, gelatinous creature without a mouth, incapable of causing itself harm, and constantly alters his perception of time to deepen his anguish. Ted, however, is grateful that he was able to save the others from further torture. Ted's closing thoughts end with the sentence that gives the story its title: \\"I have no mouth. And I must scream.\\"  Adaptations  * Ellison adapted the story into a computer game of the same name, published by Cyberdreams in 1995. Although he was not a fan of computer games and did not own a personal computer at the time, he co-authored the expanded storyline and wrote much of the game's dialogue, all on a mechanical typewriter. Ellison also voiced the supercomputer \\"AM\\" and provided artwork of himself used for a mousepad included with the game. * The comics artist John Byrne scripted and drew a comic-book adaptation for issues 1-4 of the Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor comic book published by Dark Horse (1994-1995). The Byrne-illustrated story, however, did not appear in the collection (trade paperback or hardcover editions) entitled Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor, Volume One (1996). * In 1999, Ellison released the first of several audio collections entitled \\"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\\", doing the readings ‚Äì of the title story and others ‚Äì himself. * In 2002, Mike Walker adapted the story into a radio play of the same name for BBC Radio 4, directed by Ned Chaillet.  AM's talkfields ‚Äì punchcode tape messages  Ellison uses an alternating pair of punchcode tapes as time-breaks ‚Äì representing AM's \\"talkfields\\" ‚Äì throughout the short story.

The first talkfield, used four times, translates as \\"I THINK, THEREFORE I AM\\" and the second one, seen three times, as \\"COGITO ERGO SUM\\", the same phrase in Latin. The talkfields in many of the early publications were corrupted, up until the preface of the chapter containing \\"I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream\\" in the first edition of The Essential Ellison (1991); Ellison states that in that particular edition, \\"For the first time anywhere, AM's 'talkfields' appear correctly positioned, not garbled or inverted or mirror-imaged as in all other versions.\\" AM Talkfield #1.

He was at various times a member of the Socialist Party of America, a leader of the Communist Party USA, leader of a small oppositionist party, an anti- Communist and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) helper, and foreign policy advisor to the leadership of the AFL-CIO and various unions within it. Biography =Background and early life= Lovestone was born Jacob Liebstein into a Jewish-Litvak family in a shtetl called Mo«îchadz in Grodno Governorate (then part of the Russian Empire, now in Grodno Region, Belarus). The territory of present-day Belarus was considered a \\"Lithuanian\\" area at the time. His father, Barnet, had been a rabbi, but when he emigrated to America he had to settle for a job as shammes (caretaker). Barnet came first, then sent for his family the next year. Lovestone arrived with his mother, Emma, and his siblings, Morris, Esther and Sarah at Ellis island on September 15, 1907. They originally settled on Hester Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side, but later moved to 2155 Daly Avenue in the Bronx. The family did not know their dates of birth precisely, but they assigned Jacob the date of December 15, 1897.Ted Morgan, A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone: Communist, Anti-Communist, and Spymaster. New York: Random House, 1999; pp. 4-6. Young Liebstein was attracted to socialist politics from his teens. While imbibing all the ideological currents in the vibrant New York Yiddish and English radical press, he was particularly attracted to the ideas of Daniel De Leon. It is not known whether he ever joined de Leon's Socialist Labor Party, but he was one of the 3,000 mourners who attended his funeral on May 11, 1914.Morgan, A Covert Life, pp. 8-10. Liebstein entered City College of New York in 1915. Already a member of the Socialist party, he joined its unofficial student wing, the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. He became secretary and then president of the CCNY chapter. He also met William Weinstone and Bertram Wolfe in ISS, who would go on to become his factional allies in the Communist Party. He graduated in June 1918. In February 1919 he had his name legally changed to Jay Lovestone, the surname being a literal translation of Liebstein. (During the early 20th century such name changes were a common practice for Jewish immigrants who encountered widespread antisemitism in American society.) That year he also began studying at NYU Law School, but dropped out to pursue a career as a full-time Communist party member.Morgan, A Covert Life, pp. 10-13. =The Communist years (1919‚Äì1929)= His first foray into what would become the American Communist movement began in February 1919, when the left wing elements in the Socialist Party in New York began to organize themselves as a separate faction. Lovestone was on the original organizing committee, the Committee of 15, with Wolfe, John Reed and Benjamin Gitlow. That June he attended the National Conference of the Left Wing.Fanny Horowitz, \\"Minutes of the National Left Wing Conference,\\" Department of Justice/Bureau of Investigation files, NARA M-1085, reel 936. Corvallis, OR: 1000 Flowers Publishing, 2007. He sided with the Fraina/Ruthenberg faction that opted to create a National Left Wing Council that would attempt to take over the Socialist Party. He stayed with this group after it reversed its stance, and joined the National Organizing Committee in founding the Communist Party of America on September 1, 1919, at a convention in Chicago. In 1921, Lovestone became editor of the Communist Party newspaper, The Communist, and sat on the editorial board of The Liberator, the arts and letters publication of the Workers Party of America. Upon the death of Charles Ruthenberg in 1927 he became the party's national secretary. From about 1923, the CP developed two main factions, the Pepper‚ÄìRuthenberg group and the Foster‚ÄìCannon group. Lovestone was a close adherent of the Pepper‚ÄìRuthenberg tendency, which was to be centered in New York City and to favor united-front political action in a \\"class Labor Party\\", as opposed to the Foster‚ÄìCannon group, which tended to be centered in Chicago and were most concerned with building a radicalized American Federation of Labor through a boring from within policy. In 1925 the leader of the Pepper‚ÄìRuthenberg faction, John Pepper, returned to Moscow for work in the apparatus of the Communist International, raising Lovestone's status to that of a chief lieutenant in a new Ruthenberg‚ÄìLovestone pairing. Foster and Cannon, on the other hand, parted ways, with Alexander Bittelman assuming the mantle as Foster's chief factional ally, while Jim Cannon built his power base in the party's legal defense mass organization, the International Labor Defense (ILD). With the Soviet Bolshevik party riven by a succession struggle following Lenin's death in January 1924, the factions in the US eventually corresponded with factions in the Soviet leadership, with Foster's faction being strongly supportive of Joseph Stalin and Lovestone's faction sympathetic to Nikolai Bukharin. As a result of his trip to the Comintern Congress in 1928 where James P. Cannon and Maurice Spector accidentally saw Leon Trotsky's thesis criticizing the direction of the Comintern, Cannon became a Trotskyist and decided to organize his faction in support of Trotsky's position. Cannon's support for Trotsky became known before he had fully mobilized his supporters. Lovestone led the expulsion of Cannon and his supporters in 1928. =The Communist opposition years (1929‚Äì1941)= Jay Lovestone with David Dubinsky speaking at a union rally in the 1930s When Stalin purged Bukharin from the Soviet Politburo in 1929, Lovestone suffered the consequences. A visiting delegation of the Comintern asked him to step down as party secretary in favor of his rival William Z. Foster. Lovestone refused and departed for the Soviet Union to argue his case. Lovestone insisted that he had the support of the vast majority of the Communist Party and should not have to step aside. Stalin responded that he \\"had a majority because the American Communist Party until now regarded you as the determined supporters of the Communist International. And it was only because the Party regarded you as friends of the Comintern that you had a majority in the ranks of the American Communist Party\\". When he returned to the US, Lovestone was forced to pay for his insubordination and was expelled from the party for his support of Bukharin and the Right Opposition and for his theory of American exceptionalism, which held that capitalism was more secure in the United States and thus socialists should pursue different, more moderate strategies there than elsewhere in the world. That contradicted Stalin's views and the new Third Period policy of ultra-leftism promoted by the Comintern. Lovestone and his friends had thought that they commanded the following of the mass of party members and, once expelled, optimistically named their new party the Communist Party (Majority Group). When the new group attracted only a few hundred members they changed its name to the Communist Party (Opposition). They were aligned with the International Communist Opposition, which had sections in fifteen countries. The CP(O) later became the Independent Communist Labor League and then, in 1938, the Independent Labor League of America, before dissolving in 1941. The party published the periodical Workers' Age (originally The Revolutionary Age), which was edited by Bertram Wolfe, along with a number of pamphlets. =Union and anti- communist activities= Lovestone had, while within the Communist Party, played an active role in the Party's labor activities, primarily within the United Mine Workers, where the party supported the revolt led by John Brophy against John L. Lewis's leadership. His allies within the party, particularly Charles S. Zimmerman, had a great deal of power within the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union prior to the debacle of 1926. After his expulsion, Lovestone formed a base within ILGWU Dressmakers Local 22, to which Zimmerman had returned after his expulsion from the CPUSA. Lovestone and Zimmerman worked their way into the good graces of ILGWU President David Dubinsky, who had been their fiercest enemy before their expulsion. With Dubinsky's support, Lovestone went to work for Homer Martin, the embattled President of the United Auto Workers, who was attempting to drive his political rivals out of the union by charging them with being communists. Martin's and Lovestone's tactics, however, only succeeded in unifying all of the disparate groups in the leadership of the union at that time into a single coalition opposed to Martin and, unintentionally, enhancing the reputation of CP members within the union. The UAW's Executive Board, with the support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), proceeded to oust Martin, who left to form his own rump version of the UAW. Lovestone followed him for a time. Lovestone had maintained his relationship with Dubinsky throughout this period; Dubinsky helped finance Martin's new union and worked for its affiliation with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). In 1943, Lovestone became the director of the International Ladies' and Garment Workers' Union's (ILGWU) International Affairs Department. Dubinsky also helped Lovestone find work in 1941 with an organization favoring the United States' entry into World War II. Dubinsky had concerns that Lovestone's past role in the Communist Party would taint him and suggested that Lovestone change his name; Lovestone declined to do so. In 1944, Dubinsky arranged to place Lovestone in the AFL's Free Trade Union Committee, where he worked out of the ILGWU's headquarters. Along with Irving Brown he led the activities of the American Institute for Free Labor Development, an organization sponsored by the AFL which worked internationally, organizing free labor unions in Europe and Latin America which were not Communist-controlled. In connection with that work he cooperated closely with the CIA, feeding information about Communist labor- union activities to James Jesus Angleton, the CIA's counterintelligence chief, in order to undermine Communist influence in the international union movement and provide intelligence to the US government. He remained there until 1963 when he became director of the AFL-CIO's International Affairs Department (IAD), which quietly sent millions of dollars from the CIA to aid anti- communist activities internationally, particularly in Latin America.Victor Reuther The Brothers Reuther and the Story of the UAW. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1976; pgs. 411-427. In 1973, AFL-CIO president George Meany discovered that Lovestone was still in contact with Angleton of the CIA, who was conducting illegal domestic spying activities, despite being told seven years earlier to terminate this relationship.Morgan, A Covert Life, pp. 350-351. Meany chose to force Lovestone out by issuing an instruction with which he knew Lovestone would not comply. On March 6, 1974, he informed Lovestone that he wanted to close his New York office, stop publication of Free Trade Union News, and transfer Lovestone and his library and archives to Washington, D.C. When Lovestone argued he could not relocate his library of 6,000 books, he was dismissed, effective July 1.Morgan, A Covert Life, pg. 351. Lovestone's successor, Ernie Lee, maintained a low profile during his tenure from 1974 through 1982 and significantly scaled back the AFL-CIO's aggressive advocacy of a hawkish, anti-d√©tente foreign policy. =Death and legacy= Lovestone died on March 7, 1990, at the age of 92.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/09/obituaries/jay-lovestone-communist- leader-who-turned-against-party-dies.html Jay Lovestone's massive accumulation of papers, today encompassing more than 865 archival boxes,Grace M.

Common types include commercial banks, investment banks, stockbrokers, pooled investment funds, and stock exchanges. Financial intermediaries reallocate otherwise uninvested capital to productive enterprises through a variety of debt, equity, or hybrid stakeholding structures.Infinite Financial Intermediation, 50 Wake Forest Law Review 643 (2015), available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2711379 Through the process of financial intermediation, certain assets or liabilities are transformed into different assets or liabilities. As such, financial intermediaries channel funds from people who have surplus capital (savers) to those who require liquid funds to carry out a desired activity (investors). A financial intermediary is typically an institution that facilitates the channeling of funds between lenders and borrowers indirectly. That is, savers (lenders) give funds to an intermediary institution (such as a bank), and that institution gives those funds to spenders (borrowers). This may be in the form of loans or mortgages.Robert E. Wright and Vincenzo Quadrini. Money and Banking: Chapter 2 Section 5: Financial Intermediaries. Accessed June 28, 2012 Alternatively, they may lend the money directly via the financial markets, and eliminate the financial intermediary, which is known as financial disintermediation. In the context of climate finance and development, financial intermediaries generally refer to private sector intermediaries, such as banks, private equity, venture capital funds, leasing companies, insurance and pension funds, and micro- credit providers.Institute for Policy Studies(2013), \\"Financial Intermediaries\\", A Glossary of Climate Finance Terms, IPS, Washington DC Increasingly, international financial institutions provide funding via companies in the financial sector, rather than directly financing projects.Eurodad (2012), \\"Investing in financial intermediaries: a way to fill the gaps in public climate finance?\\", Eurodad, Brussels Functions performed by financial intermediaries The hypothesis of financial intermediaries adopted by mainstream economics offers the following three major functions they are meant to perform: # Creditors provide a line of credit to qualified clients and collect the premiums of debt instruments such as loans for financing homes, education, auto, credit cards, small businesses, and personal needs. #:Converting short-term liabilities to long term assets (banks deal with large number of lenders and borrowers, and reconcile their conflicting needs) # Risk transformation #:Converting risky investments into relatively risk-free ones. (lending to multiple borrowers to reduce the risk) # Convenience denomination #:Matching small deposits with large loans and large deposits with small loans Advantages and disadvantages of financial intermediaries There are two essential advantages from using financial intermediaries: # Cost advantage over direct lending/borrowing # Market failure protection; The conflicting needs of lenders and borrowers are reconciled, preventing market failure The cost advantages of using financial intermediaries include: #Reconciling conflicting preferences of lenders and borrowers #Risk aversion intermediaries help spread out and decrease the risks #Economies of scale - using financial intermediaries reduces the costs of lending and borrowing #Economies of scope - intermediaries concentrate on the demands of the lenders and borrowers and are able to enhance their products and services (use same inputs to produce different outputs) Various disadvantages have also been noted in the context of climate finance and development finance institutions. These include a lack of transparency, inadequate attention to social and environmental concerns, and a failure to link directly to proven developmental impacts.Bretton Woods Project (2010)\\"Out of sight, out of mind? IFC investment through banks, private equity firms and other financial intermediaries\\", Bretton Woods Project, London  Types of financial intermediaries  According to the dominant economic view of monetary operations,\\"The currently dominant intermediation of loanable funds (ILF) model views banks as barter institutions that intermediate deposits of pre-existing, real, loanable funds between depositors and borrowers. The problem with this view is that, in the real world, there are no pre-existing loanable funds; and ILF-type institutions do not exist. Instead, banks create new funds in the act of lending, through matching loan and deposit entries, both in the name of the same customer, on their balance sheets. The financing- through-money-creation (FMC) model reflects this, and therefore views banks as fundamentally monetary institutions. The FMC model also recognises that, in the real world, there is no deposit multiplier mechanism.\\" From \\"Banks are not intermediaries of loanable funds ‚Äî and why this matters\\", by Zoltan Jakab and Michael Kumhof, Bank of England Working Paper No 529, May 2015 the following institutions are or can act as financial intermediaries: * Banks * Mutual savings banks * Savings banks * Building societies * Credit unions * Financial advisers or brokers * Insurance companies * Collective investment schemes * Pension funds * cooperative societies * Stock exchanges According to the alternative view of monetary and banking operations, banks are not intermediaries but \\"fundamentally money creation\\" institutions, while the other institutions in the category of supposed \\"intermediaries\\" are simply investment funds. Summary Financial intermediaries are meant to bring together those economic agents with surplus funds who want to lend (invest) to those with a shortage of funds who want to borrow.\\"The Role Of Financial Intermediaries\\" , Finance Informer website, Australia (accessed 10 June 2015) In doing this, they offer the benefits of maturity and risk transformation.

It is inhabited by the Svans, an ethnic subgroup of Georgians.  Geography  Situated on the southern slopes of the central Caucasus Mountains and surrounded by 3,000‚Äì5,000 meter peaks, Svaneti is the highest inhabited area in the Caucasus. Four of the 10 highest peaks of the Caucasus are located in the region. The highest mountain in Georgia, Mount Shkhara at 5,201 meters (17,059 feet), is located in the province. Prominent peaks include Tetnuldi (4,974 m / 16,319 ft), Shota Rustaveli (4,960 m / 16,273 ft), Mount Ushba (4,710 m / 15,453 ft), Ailama (4,525 m / 14,842 ft), as well as Lalveri, Latsga and others. Svaneti has two parts corresponding to two inhabited valleys: * Upper Svaneti (Zemo Svaneti) on the upper Inguri River; administratively part of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti; main town Mestia * Lower Svaneti (Kvemo Svaneti) on the upper Tskhenistsqali River; administratively part of Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti; main town Lentekhi They are separated by the Svaneti Range which is almost as high as the main Caucasus range. Historical Svaneti also included the Kodori Gorge in the adjoining rebel province of Abkhazia, and part of the adjacent river valleys of Kuban and Baksan north of the crest of the Caucasus. Writing in 1848, Bodenstedt said that Upper Svaneti could only be reached by a difficult footpath which was closed in winter.Friedrich Bodenstedt, Die Voelker Des Kaukasus..., 1848, page 69 right =Landscape= View of the Caucasus Mountains in Svaneti. The landscape of Svaneti is dominated by mountains that are separated by deep gorges. Most of the region which lies below 1,800 meters (5,904 ft) above sea level is covered by mixed and coniferous forests. The forest zone is made up of tree species such as spruce, fir, beech, oak, and hornbeam. Other species that are less common but may still be found in some areas include chestnut, birch, maple, pine and box. The zone which extends from 1,800 meters to roughly about 3,000 meters (5,904‚Äì9,840 ft) above sea level consists of alpine meadows and grasslands. Eternal snows and glaciers take over in areas that are over 3,000 meters above sea level. The region is notable for its glaciers and picturesque summits. Svaneti's signature peak is probably Mount Ushba which towers over the Inguri Gorge and can be seen from many parts of the region. =Climate= The climate of Svaneti is humid and is influenced by the air masses coming in from the Black Sea throughout the year. Average temperatures and precipitation vary considerably with elevation. Annual precipitation ranges between 1000 and 3200 mm (39 and 126 inches). The highest amount of precipitation falls on the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The region is characterized by very heavy snowfall in the winter and avalanches are a frequent occurrence. Snow cover may reach 5 meters (16.4 feet) in some areas. In general, the lowest regions of Svaneti (800‚Äì1200 meters / 2624‚Äì3936 feet above sea level) are characterized by long, warm summers and relatively cold and snowy winters. Middle altitudes (1200‚Äì1800 meters above sea level) experience relatively warm summers and cold winters. Areas above 2000 meters above sea level lie within a zone that experiences short, cool summers (less than 3 months) and long and cold winters. Large parts of Svaneti lie above 3000 meters (9840 feet) above sea level, a zone which does not have a real summer. Due to Svaneti's close proximity to the Black Sea, the region is spared from the extremely cold winter temperatures that are characteristic of high mountains.  History  Svanetian tower An 11th-century fresco of the Svan nobleman Mikael Chagiani from Adishi. The Svans are usually identified with the Soanes mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans. The province had been a dependency of Colchis, and of its successor kingdom of Lazica (Egrisi) until AD 552, when the Svans took advantage of the Lazic War, repudiated this connection and went over to the Persians. The Byzantines wanted the region, for if they secured its passes, they could prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. With the end of the war (562), Svanetia again became part of Lazica. Then, the province joined the Kingdom of Abkhazia (John and Adarnase of the Shavliani dynasty, 871‚Äì893) to form a unified monarchy which was incorporated into the Kingdom of Georgia in the early 11th century. Svanetia became a duchy (saeristavo) within it, governed by a duke (eristavi). The province‚Äôs Orthodox culture flourished particularly during the Georgian ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù under Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213), who was respected almost as goddess by the Svanetians. The legend has it that the duchy was annually visited by Tamar. The Svans had been known as fierce warriors for centuries. Their inflatable war banner was named Lemi (Lion) because of its shape. The marauding Mongols never reached Svanetia and, for a time, the region became a cultural safe house. Following the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1460s, fighting broke out for controlling the province. Part of Upper Svanetia formed an independent principality under the Princes Dadeshkeliani, a branch of the Gelovani family, while Lower Svanetia, originally ruled by the Princes Gelovani, was temporarily usurped and subdued by the Mingrelian princes Dadiani. Facing serious internal conflict, Prince Tsioq‚Äô Dadeshkeliani of Svanetia signed a treaty of protectorate with the Russian Empire on November 26, 1833. Difficult to access, the region retained significant autonomy until 1857, when Russia took advantage of the dynastic feud in Svanetia and effectively abolished the principality‚Äôs autonomy. In 1875, the Russians toughened their rule by imposing additional taxes. Protests ensued, and Russia deployed troops against the province. Despite having suffered heavy losses, the Russian army units eventually crushed the rebels burning their stronghold Khalde to the ground in 1876. Part of the Russian governorate of Kutais, Svanetia was divided into two raions (districts) ‚Äî Mestia (former Sethi) and Lentekhi ‚Äî under the Soviet rule. The unsuccessful anti-Soviet Svaneti uprising took place in the region in 1921. Mestia, c. 1890s In 1987, avalanches destroyed several homes and killed at least 80, many of them school children. In the aftermath the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a decree to resettle some 2,500 families to districts of eastern Georgia (eco-migration to Marneuli, Tetritskaro, Bolnisi, Sagarejo, Gardabani, Dmanisi, Kaspi, Tskaltubo, Khoni, Ozurgeti, and Lanchkhuti rayons).Trier, Tom & Turashvili, Medea (2007): Resettlement of Ecologically Displaced Persons - Solution of a Problem or Creation of a New? Eco-Migration in Georgia 1981‚Äì2006. ECMI Monograph #6. The end of the Soviet Union and subsequent Georgian Civil War created severe socioeconomic problems in the region. While the Svanetian population resisted the unpleasant conditions of the high mountain environment they lived in for centuries, the increasing economic difficulties of the last two decades and frequent natural disasters ‚Äî floods and landslides as of April 2005 () have brought about a strong tendency towards migration. The province became a safe haven for criminals threatening local residents and tourists. Large-scale anti-criminal operations carried out by the Georgian Special Forces as of March 2004 President Hails Anti-Crime Operation in Svaneti Civil Georgia, Tbilisi, 24 March 2004 resulted in significant improvement of the situation.  Population  The historic region of Lower Svaneti in Georgia. The Svans, the indigenous population of Svanetia, are ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the 1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as Jg√´r√¶g to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family. The Svan really respect the older women in families. Typically bilingual, they use both Georgian and their own, unwritten Svan language, which together with the Georgian, Mingrelian, and Laz languages constitute the South Caucasian or Kartvelian language family.  Culture and tourism  Svanetia is known for its architectural treasures and picturesque landscapes. The botany of Svanetia is legendary among travelers. The famous Svanetian tower houses, erected mainly in the 9th-12th centuries, make the region‚Äôs villages more attractive. In the province are dozens of Georgian Orthodox churches and various fortified buildings. Architectural monuments of Upper Svanetia are included in a list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Svan songs and dances are notable cultural traditions. Svanetia boasts arguably the most archaic three-part polyphonic singing. Most of their songs are connected to round dances, are performed very loudly and are full of dissonant chords.Jordania, J.

The corporate headquarters is in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Borroughs was established in 1938 under the name Probar Company. The company began as a contract fabricator, producing saw cabinets. It soon branched out and began producing fluorescent strip lighting fixtures as well as continuing contract work for automotive accessory firms. In 1939, the founder, Walter L. Borroughs, changed the name to Borroughs Manufacturing Company. During World War II, Borroughs was subcontracted to manufacture various military components, such as land tank components, gun turret components, air scoops for aircraft, and water baffles for amphibious landing craft. After the war, the company manufactured automotive bins. American Metal Products Company purchased the company in 1950, following Mr. Borroughs' death in 1948. Under the new management, Borroughs began to produce office furniture, industrial shelving, and storage units. When American Metal Products merged with Lear Siegler, Inc. in 1966, Borroughs became a separate division of the new corporation. In 1987, Forstmann Little purchased Lear Siegler; in 1991, some of Borroughs' managers and partial owners in Kalamazoo purchased the company from Forstmann Little. In the 1990s, the company's products included checkstands and other retail fixtures. The Borroughs Series 90 conveyor belt system became widely used after many Pathmark supermarkets began installing them. At one time, Borroughs checkstands were in use at many Wal-Mart stores as well.

This Federal Reserve committee makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of the United States money supply. Under the terms of the original Federal Reserve Act, each of the Federal Reserve banks was authorized to buy and sell in the open market bonds and short term obligations of the United States Government, bank acceptances, cable transfers, and bills of exchange. Hence, the reserve banks were at times bidding against each other in the open market. In 1922, an informal committee was established to execute purchases and sales. The Banking Act of 1933 formed an official FOMC. The FOMC is the principal organ of United States national monetary policy. The Committee sets monetary policy by specifying the short- term objective for the Fed's open market operations, which is usually a target level for the federal funds rate (the rate that commercial banks charge between themselves for overnight loans). The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve System in foreign exchange markets, although any intervention in foreign exchange markets is coordinated with the U.S. Treasury, which has responsibility for formulating U.S. policies regarding the exchange value of the dollar.  Membership  The Committee consists of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, the president of the New York Fed, and four of the other eleven regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, serving one year terms. The Fed chair has been invariably appointed by the committee as its chair since 1935, solidifying the perception of the two roles as one. The Federal Open Market Committee was formed by the Banking Act of 1933 (codified at ), and did not include voting rights for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The Banking Act of 1935 revised these protocols to include the Board of Governors and to closely resemble the present-day FOMC, and was amended in 1942 to give the current structure of twelve voting members. Four of the Federal Reserve Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. The rotating seats are filled from the following four groups of banks, one bank president from each group: Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond; Cleveland and Chicago; Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas; and Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. The New York President always has a voting membership. All of the Reserve Bank presidents, even those who are not currently voting members of the FOMC, attend Committee meetings, participate in discussions, and contribute to the Committee's assessment of the economy and policy options. The Committee meets eight times a year, approximately once every six weeks.  Meetings  Modern-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the Eccles Building, Washington, D.C. By law, the FOMC must meet at least four times each year in Washington, D.C. Since 1981, eight regularly scheduled meetings have been held each year at intervals of five to eight weeks. If circumstances require consultation or consideration of an action between these regular meetings, members may be called on to participate in a special meeting or a telephone conference, or to vote on a proposed action by proxy. At each regularly scheduled meeting, the Committee votes on the policy to be carried out during the interval between meetings. Attendance at meetings is restricted because of the confidential nature of the information discussed and is limited to Committee members, nonmember Reserve Bank presidents, staff officers, the Manager of the System Open Market Account, and a small number of Board and Reserve Bank staff.  Decision-making process  Before each regularly scheduled meeting of the FOMC, System staff prepare written reports on past and prospective economic and financial developments that are sent to Committee members and to nonmember Reserve Bank presidents. Reports prepared by the Manager of the System Open Market Account on operations in the domestic open market and in foreign currencies since the last regular meeting are also distributed. At the meeting itself, staff officers present oral reports on the current and prospective business situation, on conditions in financial markets, and on international financial developments. In its discussions, the Committee considers factors such as trends in prices and wages, employment and production, consumer income and spending, residential and commercial construction, business investment and inventories, foreign exchange markets, interest rates, money and credit aggregates, and fiscal policy. The Manager of the System Open Market Account also reports on account transactions since the previous meeting. After these reports, the Committee members and other Reserve Bank presidents turn to policy. Typically, each participant expresses his or her own views on the state of the economy and prospects for the future and on the appropriate direction for monetary policy. Then each makes a more explicit recommendation on policy for the coming intermeeting period (and for the longer run, if under consideration).  Consensus  Finally, the Committee must reach a consensus regarding the appropriate course for policy, which is incorporated in a directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York‚Äîthe Bank that executes transactions for the System Open Market Account. The directive is cast in terms designed to provide guidance to the Manager in the conduct of day-to-day open market operations. The directive sets forth the Committee's objectives for long-run growth of certain key monetary and credit aggregates. It also sets forth operating guidelines for the degree of ease or restraint to be sought in reserve conditions and expectations with regard to short-term rates of growth in the monetary aggregates. Policy is implemented with emphasis on supplying reserves in a manner consistent with these objectives and with the nation's broader economic objectives. Congressional oversight Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must appear before Congressional hearings at least twice per year regarding \\"the efforts, activities, objectives and plans of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee with respect to the conduct of monetary policy\\". The statute requires that the Chairman appear before the House Committee on Financial Services in February and July of odd-numbered years, and before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in February and July of even-numbered years.See . There is a very strong consensus against basing selection of committee members primarily on the candidate's political views.http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments Interest rate targeting The committee's practice of interest rate targeting has been criticized by some commentators who argue that it may risk an inflationary bias. Possible alternative rules that enjoy some support among economists include the traditional monetarist formula of targeting stable growth in an appropriately chosen monetary aggregate, and inflation targeting, now practiced by many central banks. Under inflationary pressure in 1979, the Fed temporarily abandoned interest rate targeting in favor of targeting non- borrowed reserves. It concluded, however, that this approach led to increased volatility in interest rates and monetary growth, and reversed itself in 1982. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke sympathetically as a Governor in 2003 of the inflation targeting approach. He explained that even a central bank like the Fed, which does not orient its monetary policies around an explicit, published inflation target, nonetheless takes account of its goal of low and stable inflation in formulating its interest rate targets. Bernanke summed up his overall assessment of inflation targeting as follows: In keeping with his 2003 speech as Governor, Bernanke as Chairman has attempted to promote greater transparency in Fed communications. The Fed now publicly indicates the range within which it would like to see future inflation.

The story became a national sensation in Japan, acquiring mythic overtones, and has been interpreted by artists, philosophers, novelists and filmmakers. Abe was released after having served five years in prison and went on to write an autobiography. Family background Sada Abe was the seventh of eight children of Shigeyoshi and Katsu Abe, an upper middle-class family of tatami mat makers in Tokyo's Kanda neighborhood. Only four of the Abe children survived to adulthood, and of those Sada was the youngest.. Sada's father, originally from Chiba Prefecture, had been adopted into the Abe family to help with the business, which he eventually inherited. Aged 52 at the time of Sada's birth, Shigeyoshi Abe was described by police as \\"an honest and upright man\\" who had neither conspicuous vices nor any brushes with the law, although some acquaintances reported him to be somewhat self-centered, with a taste for extravagance. Likewise, Sada's mother had no known legal or moral blemishes on her record. Sada's brother Shintar≈ç was known as a womanizer, and after his marriage, ran away with his parents' money. Her sister Teruko was also known to have had several lovers. Sada's father sent Teruko to work in a brothel, then not an uncommon way to punish female sexual promiscuity in Japan, although he soon bought her back. Teruko's past was not considered a hindrance to marriage for those of the Abes' class at the time, and she soon married. Early life Sada Abe was born in 1905. Her mother doted on Sada, who was her youngest surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished. She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the shamisen, both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with geishas and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor. Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time, and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons and wearing stylish make-up. As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintar≈ç, became more pressing, Abe was often sent out of the house alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers. At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances.Abe, Sada quoted in Second Interrogation of Abe Sada in Chapter \\"Notes from the Police Interrogation of Abe Sada\\": While we were playing around on the second floor he forced himself into me.Abe, Sada quoted in , Chapter 5. \\"Acquaintance Rape\\", .. in the summer of my fifteenth year because I was raped by a student at a friend's house ... Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager. As Abe became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in Yokohama in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction., Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity. Abe's encounter with the geisha world proved to be a frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood, with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity and eventually contracted syphilis. Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations same as a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter this better-paying profession., Early 1930s The brothel where Abe was arrested Abe began work as a prostitute in Osaka's famous Tobita brothel district, but soon gained a reputation as a trouble-maker. She stole money from clients and attempted to leave the brothel several times, but was soon tracked down by the well-organized legal prostitution system. After two years, Abe eventually succeeded in escaping the licensed prostitution system and began working as a waitress. However, not satisfied with the wages, she was soon working as a prostitute again, though now unlicensed, and began working in the unlicensed brothels of Osaka in 1932. Abe's mother died in January 1933, and Abe traveled to Tokyo to visit her father, and her mother's grave. She entered into the prostitution market in Tokyo and while there became a mistress for the first time. When her father became gravely ill in January 1934, Abe nursed him for ten days until his death. In October 1934 Abe was arrested in a police raid on the unlicensed brothel at which she was working at the time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. Kasahara was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. He set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, \\"She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long ... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted.\\"Deposition by Kasahara Kinnosuke in When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, \\"She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear.\\" Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, \\"He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up.\\" In Nagoya in 1935, again intending to leave the sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Gor≈ç ≈åmiya, a professor and banker who aspired to become a member of the Diet of Japan (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. ≈åmiya met Abe in Tokyo and, finding that she had previously contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in Kusatsu from November until January 1936. In January, ≈åmiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business. Acquaintance with Kichiz≈ç Ishida Back in Tokyo, Abe began work as an apprentice at the Yoshidaya restaurant on February 1, 1936. The owner of this establishment, Kichiz≈ç Ishida, 42 at the time, had worked his way up in the business, starting as an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in eel dishes. He had opened Yoshidaya in Tokyo's Nakano neighborhood in 1920. When Abe joined his restaurant, Ishida had become known as a womanizer who by that time did little in the way of actually running the restaurant, which had become in fact managed primarily by his wife. Not long after Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous advances towards her. ≈åmiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, and she was responsive to Ishida‚Äôs approaches. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant to the accompaniment of a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936, Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or machiai‚Äîthe contemporary equivalent of a love hotel‚Äîin the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short \\"fling\\", the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood. Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, \\"It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man.\\" After their two-week encounter ended, Abe became agitated and began drinking excessively. She said that with Ishida she had come to know true love for the first time in her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, \\"I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all ...\\" \\"Abe Sada Incident\\" Newspaper photo taken shortly after Abe's arrest, at Takanawa Police Station, Tokyo on May 20, 1936 Site of the \\"Abe Sada Incident\\" Ishida and Abe returned to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife to the base of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took thirty tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, \\"You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you ... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward.\\" Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking. About 2:00 in the morning of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, \\"After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, and I felt a sense of clarity.\\" After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his penis and testicles with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later. With the blood she wrote on Ishida's left thigh, and on a bed sheet. She then carved (\\"Sada\\", the character for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8 am, telling the staff not to disturb Ishida. After leaving the inn, Abe met her former lover Gor≈ç ≈åmiya. She repeatedly apologized to him, but ≈åmiya, unaware of the murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe's apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association with her was bound to cause. After Ishida's body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. ≈åmiya's career was ruined, and Abe's life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards. Abe Sada panic The circumstances of Ishida's death immediately caused a national sensation. The ensuing frenzy over the search for Abe was called \\"Abe Sada panic\\". Police received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a stampede in the Ginza, resulting in a large traffic jam. In a reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo, the Ni Ni-Roku Incident (\\"2‚Äì26\\" or \\"February 26\\"), the crime was satirically dubbed the \\"Go Ichi-Hachi\\" Incident (\\"5‚Äì18\\" or \\"May 18\\"). On May 19, 1936, Abe went shopping and saw a movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to ≈åmiya, a friend, and Ishida. Abe planned to commit suicide one week after the murder, and practiced necrophilia. \\"I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me ... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis.\\" At 4:00 in the afternoon, police detectives, suspicious of the alias under which Abe had registered, came to her room. \\"Don't be so formal,\\" she told them, \\"You're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well that's me. I am Sada Abe.\\" When the police were not convinced, she displayed Ishida's genitalia as proof. Abe was arrested and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, \\"Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories.\\" The interrogating officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. \\"Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way.\\" Her answer was: \\"I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him ...\\" In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan,A book, 19 nin no Abe Sada (19 Abe Sadas), detailing similar cases, was published in 1981; and Schreiber, \\"O-Sada Serves a Grateful Nation\\" mentions at least 53 cases of women severing male genitalia since the Abe case. William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation: \\"She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love.\\" Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe Incident occurred at a time when the Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni-Ni-Roku Incident and a looming war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The case also struck a chord with the ero guro nansensu (\\"erotic-grotesque-nonsense\\") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come. When the details of the crime were made public, rumors began to circulate that Ishida's penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, \\"Ishida's was just average. [Abe] told me, 'Size doesn't make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were what I liked about Ishida. After her arrest, Ishida's penis and testicles were moved to Tokyo University Medical School's pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of World War II, but have since disappeared., Conviction and sentencing The first day of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5 a.m. crowds were already gathering to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, \\"The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert ... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him.\\" On December 21, 1936, Abe was convicted of murder in the second degree and mutilation of a corpse. Though the prosecution demanded ten years, and Abe claimed that she desired the death penalty, she was in fact sentenced to just six years in prison. Abe was confined in Tochigi women's penitentiary, where she was prisoner No. 11. Her sentence was commuted on November 10, 1940, on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary celebrations of the mythical founding of Japan, when Emperor Jimmu came to the throne. Abe was released, exactly five years after the murder, on May 17, 1941. The police record of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe's story within the context of the or \\"poison woman\\" stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s. In the wake of popular \\"poison woman\\" literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s. By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. Kanno Suga, who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate Emperor Meiji in what was known as the High Treason Incident, wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison. Fumiko Kaneko, who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered. Abe's confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for her victim. Later life Upon release from prison, Abe assumed an alias. As the mistress of a \\"serious man\\" she referred to in her memoirs as \\"Y,\\" she moved first to Ibaraki Prefecture and then to Saitama Prefecture. When Abe's true identity became known to Y's friends and family, she broke off their relationship. In the aftermath of World War II, wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the Yoshida government encouraged a \\"3-S\\" policy‚Äî\\"sports, screen, and sex\\". Pre-war writings, such as The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada (1937) depict Abe as an example of the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies. Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The buraiha writer Sakunosuke Oda wrote two stories based on Abe, and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a \\"mountain\\" of erotic books. In 1946, the writer Ango Sakaguchi interviewed Abe, treating her as an authority on both sexuality and freedom. He called Abe a \\"tender, warm figure of salvation for future generations.\\" In 1947, Ichiro Kimura's The Erotic Confessions of Abe Sada became a national bestseller, with over 100,000 copies sold. The book was in the form of an interview with Abe, but was actually based on the police interrogation records. As a response to this book, Abe wrote her own autobiography, Memoirs of Abe Sada, which was published in 1948. In contrast to Kimura's depiction of her as a pervert, she stressed her love for Ishida. The first edition of the magazine , in January 1948, featured previously unpublished photos of the incident with the headline \\"Ero-guro of the Century! First Public Release. Pictorial of the Abe Sada Incident.\\" Reflecting the change in tone in writings on Abe, the June 1949 issue of Monthly Reader called her a \\"Heroine of That Time\\" for following her own desires in a time of \\"false morality\\" and oppression. Abe capitalized on her notoriety by sitting for an interview in a popular magazine, and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called Sh≈çwa Ichidai Onna (A Woman of the Sh≈çwa Period) under the direction of dramatist Nagata Mikihiko. In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui, a working-class pub in Inari-ch≈ç in downtown Tokyo. Abe lived a low-profile life in Tokyo's Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a \\"model employee\\" award. More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic Donald Richie visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, Japanese Portraits, he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led into the middle of the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, \\"Hide the knives!\\" and \\"I'm afraid to go and pee!\\" Abe would slap the banister in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, \\"... she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. There was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back.\\" In 1969, Abe appeared in the \\"Sada Abe Incident\\" section of director Teruo Ishii's dramatized documentary , and the last known photograph of Abe was taken in August of that year.The 1969 picture of Abe, age 64, seated next to a tense male dancer can be seen at: She disappeared from the public eye in 1970. When the film In the Realm of the Senses was being planned in the mid-1970s, director Nagisa Oshima apparently sought out Abe and, after a long search, found her, her hair shorn, in a Kansai nunnery. Legacy Decades after both the incident and her disappearance, Abe continues to draw public interest: * Mutsuo Toi took an interest in Abe's case and had started writing a novel, Y≈´tokai≈çmaru (ÈõÑÂõ≥Êµ∑Áéã‰∏∏). Two years after Abe's crime, Toi perpetrated the deadliest single-shooter massacre in Japanese history before killing himself. * In addition to the documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language In the Realm of the Senses, at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei, made use of Abe's name in the title. In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan, and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston's Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan, was published in 2005. * Japanese Noise musician Merzbow adopted the alias Abe Sada for an early musical project. He released only one record under this name, the 1994 7\\" Original Body Kingdom/Gala Abe Sada 1936. * In March 2007, a four-bass noise band from Perth, Australia named Abe Sada won a Contemporary Music Grant from the Australian Department of Culture and the Arts to tour Japan in June and July 2007.

The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it was a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention with sensation, sports, sex and scandal and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark. It was sold in 1930 and merged into the New York World-Telegram.  History  =Early years= The World was formed in 1860. From 1862 to 1876, it was edited by Manton Marble, who was also its proprietor. During the 1864 United States presidential election, the World was shut down for three days after it published forged documents purportedly from Abraham Lincoln. Marble, disgusted by the defeat of Samuel Tilden in the 1876 presidential election, sold the paper after the election to a group headed by Thomas A. Scott, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who used the paper \\"as a propaganda vehicle for his stock enterprises.\\" But Scott was unable to meet the newspaper's growing losses, and in 1879 he sold it to financier Jay Gould as part of a deal that also included the Texas & Pacific Railroad. Gould, like Scott, used the paper for his own purposes, employing it to help him take over Western Union. But Gould could not turn the financial state of the newspaper around, and by the 1880s, it was losing $40,000 a year. =Joseph Pulitzer years= Joseph Pulitzer bought the World in 1883 and began an aggressive era of circulation building. Reporter Nellie Bly became one of America's first investigative journalists, often working undercover. As a publicity stunt for the paper, inspired by the Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days, she traveled around the planet in 72 days in 1889‚Äì1890. In 1890, Pulitzer built the New York World Building, the tallest office building in the world at the time. In 1889, Julius Chambers was appointed by Pulitzer as managing editor of the New York World; he served until 1891.Dictionary of American Biography (1936) Charles Scribner's Sons, New York Advertising poster for the July 28, 1895, New York Sunday World In 1896, the World began using a four-color printing press; it was the first newspaper to launch a color supplement, which featured The Yellow Kid cartoon Hogan's Alley. It joined a circulation battle with William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal-American. In 1899 Pulitzer along with Hearst were the cause of the newsboys' strike of 1899 which led to Pulitzer's circulation dropping by 70%. The World was attacked for being \\"sensational\\", and its circulation battles with Hearst's Journal American gave rise to the term yellow journalism. The charges of sensationalism were most frequently leveled at the paper by more established publishers, who resented Pulitzer's courting of the immigrant classes. And while the World presented its fair share of crime stories, it also published damning expos√©s of tenement abuses. After a heat wave in 1883 killed a disproportionate number of poor children, the World published stories about it, featuring such headlines as \\"Lines of Little Hearses\\". Its coverage spurred action in the city for reform. Hearst reproduced Pulitzer's approach in the San Francisco Examiner and later in the Journal American. Charles Chapin was hired in 1898 as City Editor of the Evening World. He was most known for embracing the sensational and showing little empathy in the face of tragedy, only taking a more solemn tone when reporting on the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. He controlled the newsroom with an iron fist, and was commonly despised by the journalists who worked for him. Chapin fired 108 newspaper men during his tenure. However, Stanley Walker still referred to him as \\"the greatest city editor that ever lived.\\" His time at the World ended when, after falling into financial ruin, he murdered his wife in 1918. He was sentenced to Sing Sing Prison and died there in 1930. Special Christmas 1899 section featuring a story by Mark Twain 1904 political cartoon of President Theodore Roosevelt Frank Irving Cobb was employed on a trial basis as the editor of the World in 1904 by publisher Pulitzer. Cobb was a fiercely independent Kansan who resisted Pulitzer's attempts to \\"run the office\\" from his home. The elder man was so invested in the paper that he continually meddled with Cobb's work. The two found common ground in their support of Woodrow Wilson, but they had many other areas of disagreement. When Pulitzer's son took over administrative responsibility of The World in 1907, his father wrote a precisely worded resignation. Cobb had it printed in every New York paper‚Äîexcept the World. Pulitzer raged at the insult, but slowly began to respect Cobb's editorials and independent spirit. Exchanges, commentaries, and messages between them increased. The good rapport between the two was based largely on Cobb's flexibility. In May 1908, Cobb and Pulitzer met to outline plans for a consistent editorial policy. Pulitzer's demands for editorials on contemporary news led to overwork by Cobb. The publisher sent his managing editor on a six-week tour of Europe to restore his spirit. Shortly after Cobb's return, Pulitzer died. Cobb then published Pulitzer's resignation. Cobb retained the editorial policies he had shared with Pulitzer until he died of cancer in 1923. =Later years= When Pulitzer died in 1911, he passed control of the World to his sons Ralph, Joseph and Herbert. The World continued to grow under its executive editor Herbert Bayard Swope, who hired writers such as Frank Sullivan and Deems Taylor. Among the World's noted journalists were columnists Franklin Pierce Adams (F.P.A.) who wrote \\"The Conning Tower,\\" Heywood Broun who penned \\"It Seems To Me\\" on the editorial page, and hardboiled writer James M. Cain. C. M. Payne created several comic strips for the newspaper. The paper published the first crossword puzzle in December 1913. The annual reference book, called The World Almanac, was founded by the newspaper, and its name, World Almanac, is directly descended from the newspaper. The paper ran a twenty-article series that was an expos√© on the 20th-century revival of the Ku Klux Klan, starting September 6, 1921. In 1931, Pulitzer's heirs went to court to sell the World; a surrogate court judge decided in their favor; Scripps-Howard chain owner Roy W. Howard purchased the paper to eliminate its competition. He closed the World and laid off the staff of 3,000 after the final issue was printed on February 27, 1931, then merely replaced the word \\"Evening\\" on his afternoon paper, the Evening Telegram, renaming it the New York World-Telegram.  Comic strips  The New York World was one of the first newspapers to publish comic strips, starting around 1890, and contributed greatly to the development of the American comic strip. Notable strips that originated with the World included Outcault's Hogan's Alley, The Captain and the Kids, Everyday Movies, Fritzi Ritz, Joe Jinks, and Little Mary Mixup. Under the names World Feature Service and New York World Press Publishing the company also syndicated comic strips to other newspapers around the country beginning around 1905. With the Scripps' acquisition of the World newspaper and its syndication assets in February 1931, the World's most popular strips were brought over to Scripps' United Feature Syndicate.Booker, M. Keith. \\"United Feature Syndicate,\\" in Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas (ABC-CLIO, 2014), p. 399. Legacy Janet E. Steele argues that Pulitzer put a stamp on his age when he brought his brand of journalism from St. Louis to New York in 1883. In his New York World, Pulitzer emphasized illustrations, advertising, and a culture of consumption for working men. He believed they saved money to enjoy life with their families when they could, at Coney Island, for example. By contrast, the long-established editor Charles A. Dana, of The Sun, held to a traditional view of the working man as one engaged in a struggle to better his working conditions and to improve himself. Dana thought that readers in the 20th century followed fewer faddish illustrations and wished newspapers did not need advertising. Dana resisted buying a Linotype. In time the more sensational approach to news, advertising, and content triumphed. Revival On May 16, 2011, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism announced that it was launching an online publication named The New York World, in honor of the original newspaper published by Pulitzer, who founded the graduate school. The university said the mission of the publication would be \\"to provide New York City citizens with accountability journalism about government operations that affect their lives.\\" It is to be staffed mainly by those who have completed master's or doctoral degrees, and other affiliates of the school.\\"The New York World (online)\\" , Press release, Columbia Journalism School Notable journalists of the World *Eunice Eloisae Gibbs Allyn (1847 - 1916) *John A.

In the article, she argues for some form of nationally consistent recognition of same-sex relationships. On 25 July 2004, Plibersek was loudly heckled at an anti- homophobia rally due to the issue. At the Australian Labor Party national conference in 2011, the delegates voted to include same-sex marriage as official party policy, although MPs were allowed a conscience vote.ALP platform changes to support gay marriage Same-sex marriage was legalised in Australia after a postal vote in 2017. =Iraq War= Plibersek opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was reported that when US President, George W. Bush, visited the Australian Parliament in 2003, 'Sydney Labor MP Tanya Plibersek walked around the chamber as President Bush shook hands with MPs to give Bush's national security adviser Condoleezza Rice a book of speeches by Labor MPs opposing Australia invading Iraq without UN approval.' She also stated in Parliament, \\"I do not support an attack on Iraq. I particularly do not support a pre-emptive first strike. Nor do I support any action that is initiated by the US alone rather than being sanctioned by the United Nations.\\" =Israel= Speaking in the House of Representatives on 17 September 2002, Plibersek said: \\"I can think of a rogue state which consistently ignores UN resolutions, whose ruler is a war criminal responsible for the massacres of civilians in refugee camps outside its borders. The US supports and funds this country. This year it gave it a blank cheque to continue its repression of its enemies. It uses US military hardware to bulldoze homes and kill civilians. It is called Israel, and the war criminal is Ariel Sharon. Needless to say, the US does not mention the UN resolutions that Israel has ignored for 30 years; it just continues sending the money...\\"Hansard Tuesday, 17 September 2002, Page 6455 Barry Cohen, a Labor member of parliament and Hawke Government minister, had on several occasions cited Plibersek's remarks as evidence of growing anti- semitism and anti-Israel sentiment in the Labor Party.The Anti-Semitic Labor Party, The Age, 25 October 2004.The Religion Report: 27 October 2004 ‚Äì Barry Cohen on the ALP and anti-Semitism, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 27 October 2004. Plibersek's remarks again gained prominence in October 2013, after she and Bill Shorten were elected as deputy leader and leader of the Labor Party, respectively. After choosing to take on the foreign affairs portfolio while in opposition, Liberal Party MP Julie Bishop, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said Plibersek should \\"publicly retract those statements\\". The Australian noted that Plibersek's appointment was likely to be criticised by the Jewish community in Australia.Israel attack threatens Tanya Plibersek's choice of foreign affairs portfolio, The Australian, 16 October 2013.

The Path of the Green Man. New York: Citadel Books, 2005. pp.121-122 It follows the lives of three teenage girls from different social cliques, who come together over a mutual interest in witchcraft. It was published between February 5, 2001 and March 19, 2002. About the Series Kate Morgan, a preppy, popular basketball player, checks out a book of spells while doing research for her history paper on medieval witch trials. She casts a love spell, which leads to disaster. She seeks the help of two girls who had previously checked out the spellbook, Annie Crandall, an intellectual, and Cooper Rivers, an alternative outsider. After putting things to rights, the three decide to continue studying Wicca together, which they do at a local New Age store called Crones' Circle. Each of them face various conflicts on her path, both external and internal. Kate is torn between fitting in and embracing the Wiccan path; Annie tries to reconcile her scientific, rational thinking with her new-found intuitive, emotional faith, as well as coming to terms with her parents' deaths years before; the headstrong and independent Cooper has trouble adjusting to both the unpredictability of magic and the novelty of intense friendship. The series takes place over a period of roughly one year and two months, during which Kate, Annie, and Cooper undergo the traditional year-and-a-day of Wiccan study before being initiated into a coven. Isobel Bird wrote the series to do what many non-fiction books about Wicca fail to do: show how Wiccans experience their religion.Author Profile: Isobel Bird Thus, the books cover a wide range of topics related to Wiccan life beyond outright practice, including conflicts with mainstream society, the diversity of the Neo-Pagan community, and legal rights. Originally released in mass market paperback, the series is currently out of print, though the books are still available used and as eBooks. The eBooks feature bonus material, such as interviews with Isobel Bird, crafts, and magical exercises. Chapter excerpts are available on the HarperCollins website. The first nine books are available in Germany and France, where the series is known as Magic Circle. It is published in German by Schneiderbuch.

He also wrote a short story titled \\"Ever After\\" for the YA horror anthology 666: The Number of the Beast under that name. Main characters =Kate Morgan= At the beginning of the series Kate Morgan is a 15-year-old sophomore who enjoys her time on the girls' basketball team and crushing over the most popular boy in school; Scott Coogan. In the pilot novel she is friends with fellow basketball teammates Tara Redding, Jessica Talbot and the self-involved ringleader, Sherrie Adams who is known for spreading gossip and rumors whether they be true or false. But as the series progresses she becomes friends with Annie Crandall, Cooper Rivers and later, a runaway teen Sasha, who is introduced in the 2nd book Merry Meet. Throughout the series Kate is living with her parents Mr. Morgan; who owns and works at a sporting goods store and Mrs. Morgan, who works at a catering company, while her elder brother Kyle is away at college. Kate's relationships with her mother and father are relatively normal and good natured, but when she \\"comes out of the broom closet\\" everything changes when they force her to see a psychiatrist and ground her from seeing her friends. However, after Kate convinces them to perform a healing ritual on their ill Aunt Annette \\"Netty\\", and slowly gets them to know her Wiccan teachers Sophia and Archer, their relationship begins to mend and gets back on good graces. In the first novel, Kate playfully performs a love spell that enchants her crush, senior Scott Coogan, into noticing her and eventually falling in love with her. The spell, although seemingly innocent enough, backfires due to its selfish connotations and causes a series of incidents which ultimately causes Kate to seek the help of Annie Crandall and later Cooper Rivers, two socially awkward teenage girls in her grade who also checked out the same book of spells which tempted Kate into the whole debacle. The girls form an unlikely alliance and bond that initially solves the problem of the backfired spell, and later, when they choose to study witchcraft at a local bookstore, \\"Crone's Circle\\", which caters to Paganism, leads them down a path of discovery, betrayal, fear, and ultimately renewed faith in themselves as young women. For Kate especially, her journey in the series leads her down a path that challenges her beliefs and the conventional norms her family has set in place for her. Shifting from a relationship with normal guy Scott to fellow Wiccan Tyler, who is the son of one of her teachers, Kate learns how connecting with Wicca and learning how to be truthful to herself and those important in her life, ultimately will help her be a better person. Throughout the series Kate faces a number of trials, such as telling her parents and brother the truth about her study of wicca, dabbling in the sacred art of Santeria, dealing with the illness of her favorite aunt, balancing her old friends and new friends in her life, and the effect witchcraft has on it all. Books The first four books are told from the point of view of only one girl each. Kate is the center of So Mote It Be and Merry Meet; Cooper is the center of Second Sight; Annie is the center of What the Cards Said. However, starting with Book 5: In the Dreaming, the point of view switches among the three girls, alternating chapters, for the rest of the series. =Book 1: So Mote It Be= :With this ribbon I do bind :my heart to yours and yours to mine. :Love, I call you, come to me, :As is my will, so mote it be. When 15-year-old Kate Morgan decides to cast a love spell, the end results are catastrophic, and she cannot stop it by herself. But the book of spells she checked out from the school library tells her of two strangers who can help her-but only if she can find them. =Book 2: Merry Meet= :Joined together, hand in hand, our circle gathers round, :to work our magic, weave the web, and dance on sacred ground. :By the Goddess we are called, witch to witch and friend to friend, :to merry meet, and merry part and merry meet again. A book of spells brought three unlikely friends; Kate, Annie and Cooper together. Now the three of them are compelled to learn more, and the door is opened with the stirring ritual of the Vernal Equinox. =Book 3: Second Sight= :Show me places cloaked in secrets, :pierce the gloom of darkest night. :Reveal the one that which has been hidden, :Let her see with second sight. :Let only the one have the third eye Kate, Annie, and Cooper are Wiccans-joined by magic bound to nature. Their dreams have turned to visions of a missing girl, calling to them for help.... =Book 4: What the Cards Said= :Cards of fortune, tell your story, :Answer all I've come to ask. :Let the draw set forth the course :of what has been and yet may pass. When Annie discovers the ancient cards of Tarot, her fascination with them spirals beyond her control, when her readings become reality. As if cursed, Annie faces her two friends Kate and Cooper with this new-found power-a power that threatens the very strength of their Wiccan bond. =Book 5: In the Dreaming= :On the eve of fair midsummer, :Longest day and shortest night, :Faerie magic, fill these woods :with joyous song and laughter bright. On the eve of Midsummer; one of the most magical nights of the year, finds Kate, Annie, and Cooper celebrating the most joyous sabbat with nature-and a few not unwelcome strangers. On a night when identities and emotions become tangled and confused under the strange solstice sky, one will be led astray. =Book 6: Ring of Light= :Here within the healing circle, :Bathe in light and pain dispel. :All that sickens, all that troubles, :wash away and be made well. Disillusioned from her time during the Midsummer festivities, Cooper abandons the Wiccan circle and Kate and Annie are left without her. But when an illness threatens someone close to one of them, Cooper returns. But can the circle, once broken, ever be restored? =Book 7: Blue Moon= :Ancient moon, o ageless traveler, :sailing on the sea of stars, :As once more you come to fullness, :Turn your shining face to ours. The second full moon of the month- the blue moon-is a time when powers are heightened, with unpredictable results. However, when Annie attempts the channeling practice called aspecting, she changes into someone Kate and Cooper hardly recognize. Can their combined strength restore Annie's spirit? =Book 8: The Five Paths= :North and South and East and West, :Earth and Fire, Air and Water, :And the fifth path, center's spirit, :on it walk the searching daughters. The five- pointed star is the Wiccan symbol of the spirit, and that's how Cooper wears it. Those not versed in the ways of the Craft find it unsettling, however. Will Cooper, Annie, and Kate be able to withstand the tide of controversy bearing down upon them or will their circle break apart forever? =Book 9: Through the Veil= :As the year comes to an ending, :In the hour 'tween old and new, :part the veil and let pass :the spirits who would travel through. As Annie, Kate, and Cooper prepare for Samhain, they are filled with anticipation. It is a time when the veil between the worlds is thin, and those who have passed into spirit world may be more easily contacted. Those Annie hold dear dwell behind this veil already-will she find them on this eve of Wiccan celebration? =Book 10: Making the Saint= :In the circle ringed with fire, :stand and meet your chosen one. :Dance among the laughing spirits, :and listen as their song is sung. A mysterious stranger shows Kate, Annie and Cooper how to connect with the spirit world, but there are alarming effects, especially for Kate. Stepping outside the bounds of Wicca, Kate becomes entranced‚Äîso much so her friends fear for her. =Book 11: The House of Winter= :Winter's cold and Winter's darkness, :wraps us in these frozen hours. :As the ceaseless wheel turns we call, :the sun to warm us with its power. Cooper, Annie, and Kate celebrate the winter solstice in true Wiccan spirit. The threesome joins the practitioners of the Craft in a remote, haunted house in the wintry mountains. An unexpected blizzard strikes, and the girls cannot resist the lure of the dark house's shrouded mystery. =Book 12: Written in the Stars= :Ever moving, Ever changing, :stars and planets come and go. :Those who watch their movements say, :As is above, so is below. Astrology‚Äîthe study of the stars‚Äîis said to reveal the truth of the universe. Cooper, Kate, and Annie find this to be alarmingly true, and their progress on the Wiccan path is nearly undone by what the stars tell them. =Book 13: And It Harm None= :\\"And it harm none, do as ye will,\\" :so says the ancient wiccan rede. :Those who do not heed its words will learn :the Power of the Law of Three. Annie, Kate, and Cooper uncover what looks like a crime. When they look more closely, it is not. Knowing the Law of Three‚Äîthat harm comes back to haunt‚Äîcan they still help a friend in need without paying for it themselves? =Book 14: The Challenge Box= :Reach inside and choose your challenge, :Find the path that you must travel. :What trials have you to over come? :What mysteries shall you unravel? Of her circle, Kate has always struggled the most in learning the ways of the Craft. As her Wiccan initiation approaches, a final challenge threatens to overcome her at last. =Book 15: Initiation= :Tonight you take the last step on :of your journey of a year and a day. :Welcome home o new-made witch, :And in our circle rest and stay. The joyful culmination of a year and day's dedication‚ÄîKate, Annie and Cooper's Wiccan initiation‚Äîbrings celebration, an exhilarating ritual, and unexpected choices for the new witches.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1918 to 1927. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Roscommon North from 1917 to 1922. He was the father of Joseph Plunkett, one of the leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916, as well as George Oliver Plunkett, Fiona Plunkett and John (Jack) Plunkett who also fought during the rising and subsequently during the Irish revolutionary period. Early life and family Plunkett was part of the prominent Irish Norman Plunkett family, which included Saint Oliver Plunkett (1629‚Äì1681). George's relatives included the Earls of Fingall‚Äîhis great-grandfather George Plunkett (1750‚Äì1824) was \\"in the sixth degree removed in relationship\\" (fifth cousin) to the 8th Earl of Fingall‚Äîand the Barons of Dunsany, whose line had conformed to the Church of Ireland in the eighteenth century.PLUNKET Lords of Fingall at Library Ireland One of that line, Sir Horace Curzon Plunkett, had served as Unionist MP for South Dublin (1892‚Äì1900) but became a convinced Home Rule supporter by 1912 as an alternative to the partition of Ireland, and served as a member of the first Irish Free State Senate (1922‚Äì23). Born in Dublin, Plunkett was the son of Patrick Joseph Plunkett (1817‚Äì1918), a builder, and Elizabeth Noble (Plunkett).The Papal Count Plunkett at HumphrysFamilyTree.com The family income allowed Plunkett to attend school in Nice in France, then at Clongowes Wood College and the University of Dublin. In Dublin he studied Renaissance and medieval art, among other topics, ultimately graduating in 1884. Plunkett spent much time abroad, primarily in Italy. =Titles= In 1884, he was created a Papal Count by Pope Leo XIII for donating money and property to the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary, a Roman Catholic nursing order.O'Connor Lysaght, D. R. (2004) \\"Plunkett, George Noble, Count Plunkett in the papal nobility (1851‚Äì1948)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, retrieved 8 June 2011 He was a Knight Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. =Marriage and issue= That year he married Josephine Cranny (1858‚Äì1944), and they had seven children: Philomena (Mimi, 1886), Joseph (1887), Moya (Maria, c. 1889), Geraldine (Gerry, c. 1891), George Oliver (1895), Fiona (c. 1896) and John (Jack, c. 1897).D. R. O'Connor Lysaght, 'Plunkett, Count George Noble', in Dictionary of Irish Biography, Cambridge University Press, 2009. From 1907 to 1916, he was curator of the National Museum in Dublin.George Plunkett's 1911 Census Form Political career =1910s= Plunkett's interest in politics likely came mostly through his sons Joseph, George and John, and though it was following the execution of Joseph that he became radicalised, it is likely that Joseph swore him into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) some time before the Rising. His daughter Fiona, in an RT√â interview in 1966, described how in the months before the Rising he went to Switzerland on behalf of the IRB leaders to try to make contacts with the Germans. Joseph, George and Jack were all sentenced to death following the Easter Rising, but George and Jack had their sentences commuted to 10 years' penal servitude, and both were released in 1917.Lawrence William White, 'Plunkett, George Oliver Michael', in Dictionary of Irish Biography, Cambridge University Press, 2009. At least two of his daughters, Philomena and Fiona, were involved in preparations for the Rising. He was expelled from the Royal Dublin Society for his sons' role in the Rising. Three weeks before the Rising Plunkett was dispatched to the Vatican to seek a private audience with Pope Benedict XV in the hope of getting the Pope's blessings. Plunkett reports that the Pope was moved by the religious symbolism of staging the Rising on Easter Sunday and persuaded him to give his \\"Apostolic Benediction\\" upon the rebels. When Plunkett once again travelled to the Vatican in 1920 Benedict XV congratulated Plunkett on his cabinet position.https://books.google.com/books?id=V_D4AwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT62&lpg;=PT62&dq;=The+Pope#v=onepage&q;=The%20Pope&f;=false The new politics was indebted to its youth wing's vocal support: they gathered in numbers at Carrick railway station to cheer on Plunkett's campaign. Amongst the crowds were the women of Cumann na mBan, \\"a big percentage of youth...large numbers of young men...[and] more curious still for those days, young women.\\"Irish Bureau of Military History WS 1770 (Kevin O'Shiel) cited in Townshend, \\"The Republic\\", p.23-4. On 3 February 1917, running as an independent candidate, Plunkett won the seat of Roscommon North in a by- election. At his victory party in Boyle he announced his decision to abstain from Westminster. He called a Convention in the Mansion House in April 1917, where after some debate it was agreed to set up a 'Council of Nine' bringing all nationalists together under one banner. He continued to build up the Liberty League Clubs. The different groups were merged in October 1917, under the newly elected √âamon de Valera, at the Sinn F√©in Convention. The League of Women Delegates protested that there were only 12 women out of 1,000 delegates; and only Countess Plunkett on the Council of Nine.Margaret Ward, 'The League of Women Delegates and Sinn Fein', \\"History Ireland\\", Autumn 1996, pp.38-40. It was de Valera's genius to adopt a flexibility that incorporated Count Plunkett and other non-republicans. Their common aim was \\"an Irish government\\".Townshend, \\"The Republic\\" (Penguin, 2014), p.20. They intended to be active citizens taking part in the nomination of elections.Senia Paseta, \\"Nationalist Women in Ireland 1900-1918\\", (CUP 2014). He was re-elected in the 1918 general election and joined the First D√°il, in which he served briefly as Ceann Comhairle. At the first public session, during a sober address given by Father Michael O'Flanagan, Count Plunkett warned the small crowd not to cheer. The Catholicity of the meetings confirmed the divisions to unionist communities.Arthur Mitchell, \\"Revolutionary Government in Ireland: D√°il √âireann 1919-22\\" (Dublin 1995), p.17. Nominally Count Plunkett was given the foreign affairs portfolio, owing to his seniority, but effectively Arthur Griffith conducted policy abroad.Irish Bureau of Military History WS 825 (Leopold H.Kerney), cited in Townshend, p.69. De Valera moved the Count to a Fine Arts portfolio in August 1921, in an effort to create an inner cabinet of only six; so a wholly new ministry was created for the purpose, \\"giving the appearance of stability and progressiveness to their affairs.\\" De Valera's green modernism marginalized the old nobility, however Catholic and correct.Mitchell, Arthur, \\"Revolutionary Government in Ireland: D√°il √âireann 1919-22\\" (Dublin 1995), p.304. =1920s to 1930s= Following the Irish War of Independence, Count Plunkett joined the anti-treaty side, and continued to support Sinn F√©in after the split with Fianna F√°il.George, Count Plunkett profile He lost his D√°il seat at the June 1927 general election. In a 1936 by- election in the Galway constituency, Plunkett ran as a joint Cumann Poblachta na h√âireann/Sinn F√©in candidate. Losing his deposit, he polled only 2,696 votes (2.1%). In 1938, he was one of the former members of the Second D√°il that purported to assign a self-proclaimed residual sovereign power to the IRA, when they signed the statement printed in the 17 December 1938 issue of the Wolfe Tone Weekly (see Irish republican legitimism). =Death and legacy= He died at the age of 96 in Dublin.

Weeks later, Sheriff Hank Keough, Fish and Game officer Jack Wells and American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Kelly Scott go to the lake to investigate the incident with mythology professor/enthusiast Hector Cyr joining them. A series of strange events soon ensue, including Kelly and Hank's canoe mysteriously being pushed into the air and flipping over, the discovery of a severed toe as well as a severed moose head before finally the decapitation of Burke, one of Hank's deputies. Later, as Hank and Hector argue, a large black bear attacks them, but a gigantic long saltwater crocodile suddenly leaps out of the water, snatches the animal in its jaws, and drags it into the lake. After finding Burke's severed head, Jack, Kelly, and Hank witness Delores Bickerman, an elderly hermit living near the lake, feeding a blindfolded cow to the giant crocodile. She reveals that she has been feeding the reptile for years after the crocodile followed her husband home and eventually killed him. Afterwards, she was placed under house arrest for initially lying to the police. Hector decides to take Deputy Sharon Gare on a trip in his helicopter and unexpectedly lands it in the crocodile's territory where it lives. While he is scuba diving, he is confronted by the creature, but he and Gare escape after distracting it with an inflatable raft. Later, Jack and Hank plan to allow Florida Fish and Game to kill the crocodile when they arrive, but Hector suggests instead that he should lure it out of the water and drug it into unconsciousness. Jack reluctantly accepts the proposal and they use one of Bickerman's cattle, dangled from the helicopter, as bait. After a few hours, the crocodile soon appears and rears up as it lunges at its prey. Hector pulls up and loses the animal, but crashes the helicopter into the lake. The crocodile comes on land and begins to attack Jack, Kelly and the group. Kelly is knocked into the lake by the crocodile's tail, but she makes it into the helicopter in time. The crocodile catches up to Kelly and attacks again, but is itself trapped in the helicopter. Jack grabs a gun and shoots it, but the firearm turns out to be a tranquilizer rifle. As Hector comes out of the water, another crocodile attacks and bites him, but Hank blows it up with his grenade launcher. Soon after, Maine Fish and Game officers arrive, where they load the neutralized crocodile onto a truck and take it to Portland, Maine to figure out what to do with it. One week later, Bickerman is shown feeding bread crumbs to many baby crocodiles, revealing the two adults were actually a mating pair. The surviving adult crocodile is later seen tied to the back of a flat-bed truck, speeding down a road to an unknown location.

Aviation career  = Founder of Varney Flying Service and Varney Air Group, predecessor of United Airlines = In October 1925, Varney was awarded one of the first contracts under the recently passed Contract Air Mail Act after the determination was made the U.S. Army Air Corps was not suited for air mail flying. He based his operation, Varney Air Service, in Pasco, Washington, and flew routes between Pasco, and Elko, Nevada, stopping in Boise, Idaho each way. Varney's first airmail flight took off on April 6, 1926. Varney, following a five company merger, sold the much expanded Varney Air Group in 1930 to United Aircraft and Transport. The company's name was changed to United Air Lines in 1933. = Founder of Varney Speed Lines, predecessor of Continental Airlines = Continental Airlines was founded in 1934 by Walter Varney and his partner Louis Mueller as Varney Speed Lines. On July 15, 1934, Varney Speed Lines flew its first trip on a 530-mile route from Pueblo, Colorado to El Paso, Texas with stops in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and Santa Fe and Albuquerque New Mexico. Varney ceded control to Mueller in 1934, and in 1936 a controlling interest in the company was sold to Robert Six who renamed it Continental Airlines in 1937, moving its headquarters to Denver. = Participant in Lockheed Corporation Reorganization = In 1932, Varney contributed half of the $40,000 needed to purchase the Lockheed division of Detroit Aircraft Corporation out of bankruptcy.

Being part of the RNase III family, Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA) into short double-stranded RNA fragments called small interfering RNA and microRNA, respectively. These fragments are approximately 20-25 base pairs long with a two-base overhang on the 3' ends. Dicer facilitates the activation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is essential for RNA interference. RISC has a catalytic component Argonaute, which is an endonuclease capable of degrading messenger RNA (mRNA).  Discovery  Dicer was given its name in 2001 by Emily Bernstein, a graduate student in Gregory Hannon's lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, who sought to discover the enzyme responsible for generating small RNA fragments from double-stranded RNA. Dicer's ability to generate ~22 nucleotide RNA fragments was discovered by separating it from the RISC enzyme complex after initiating the RNAi pathway with dsRNA transfection. This experiment showed that RISC was not responsible for generating the observable small nucleotide fragments. Subsequent experiments testing RNase III family enzymes abilities to create RNA fragments narrowed the search to Drosophila CG4792, now named Dicer. Dicer orthologs are present in many other organisms. In the moss Physcomitrella patens DCL1b, one of four DICER proteins, is not involved in miRNA biogenesis but in dicing miRNA target transcripts. Thus, a novel mechanism for regulation of gene expression, the epigenetic silencing of genes by miRNAs, was discovered. In terms of crystal structure, the first Dicer to be explored was that from the protozoan Giardia intestinalis. A PAZ domain and two RNase III domains were discovered by X-ray crystallography. The protein size is 82 kDa, while it is larger in other organisms; for example, it is 219 kDa in humans. The difference in size from humans to G. intestinalis Dicer is due to at least five different domains being present within human Dicer. These domains are important in Dicer activity regulation, dsRNA processing, and RNA interference protein factor functioning.  Functional domains  One molecule of the Dicer protein from Giardia intestinalis, which catalyzes the cleavage of dsRNA to siRNAs. The RNase III domains are colored green, the PAZ domain yellow, the platform domain red, and the connector helix blue. Human dicer (also known as hsDicer or DICER1) is classified a Ribonuclease III because it contains both helicase and PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domains. In addition to these domains, hsDicer contains four other functional domains: two RNaseIII domains and two double stranded RNA binding domains (DUF283 and dsRBD). Current research suggests the PAZ domain is capable of binding the 2 nucleotide 3' overhang of dsRNA while the RNaseIII catalytic domains form a pseudo-dimer around the dsRNA to initiate cleavage of the strands. This results in a functional shortening of the dsRNA strand. The distance between the PAZ and RNaseIII domains is determined by the angle of the connector helix and influences the length of the micro RNA product. The dsRBD domain binds the dsRNA, although the specific binding site of the domain has not been defined. It is possible that this domain works as part of a complex with other regulator proteins (TRBP in humans, R2D2, Loqs in Drosophila) in order to effectively position the RNaseIII domains and thus control the specificity of the sRNA products. The helicase domain has been implicated in processing long substrates.  Role in RNA interference  The enzyme dicer trims double stranded RNA, to form small interfering RNA or microRNA. These processed RNAs are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which targets messenger RNA to prevent translation. =Micro RNA= RNA interference is a process where the breakdown of RNA molecules into miRNA inhibits gene expression of specific host mRNA sequences. miRNA is produced within the cell starting from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) in the nucleus. These long sequences are cleaved into smaller precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which are usually 70 nucleotides with a hairpin structure. Pri-miRNA are identified by DGCR8 and cleaved by Drosha to form the pre-miRNA, a process that occurs in the nucleus. These pre-miRNA are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved by Dicer to form mature miRNA. =Small Interfering RNA= Small interfering RNA (siRNA) are produced and function in a similar manner to miRNA by cleaving double-stranded RNA with Dicer into smaller fragments, 21 to 23 nucleotides in length. Both miRNAs and siRNAs activate the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which finds the complementary target mRNA sequence and cleaves the RNA using RNase. This in turn silences the particular gene by RNA interference. siRNAs and miRNAs differ in the fact that siRNAs are typically specific to the mRNA sequence while miRNAs aren't completely complementary to the mRNA sequence. miRNAs can interact with targets that have similar sequences, which inhibits translation of different genes. In general, RNA interference is an essential part of normal processes within organisms such as humans, and it is an area being researched as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for cancer targets. Formation of miRNA used in RNA interference  Disease  = Macular degeneration = Age related macular degeneration is a prominent cause of blindness in developed countries. Dicer's role in this disease became apparent after it was discovered that affected patients showed decreased levels of Dicer in their retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mice with Dicer knocked out, lacking Dicer only in their RPE, exhibited similar symptoms. However, other mice lacking important RNAi pathway proteins like Drosha and Pasha, did not have symptoms of macular degeneration as Dicer-knockout mice. This observation suggested a Dicer specific role in retinal health that was independent of the RNAi pathway and thus not a function of si/miRNA generation. A form of RNA called Alu RNA (the RNA transcripts of alu elements)) was found to be elevated in patients with insufficient Dicer levels. These non coding strands of RNA can loop forming dsRNA structures that would be degraded by Dicer in a healthy retina. However, with insufficient Dicer levels, the accumulation of alu RNA leads to the degeneration of RPE as a result of inflammation. = Cancer = Altered miRNA expression profiles in malignant cancers suggest a pivotal role of miRNA and thus dicer in cancer development and prognosis. miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors and therefore their altered expression may result in tumorigenesis. In analysis of lung and ovarian cancer, poor prognosis and decreased patient survival times correlate with decreased dicer and drosha expression. Decreased dicer mRNA levels correlate with advanced tumor stage. However, high dicer expression in other cancers, like prostate and esophageal, has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. This discrepancy between cancer types suggests unique RNAi regulatory processes involving dicer differ amongst different tumor types. Dicer is also involved in DNA repair. DNA damage increases in mammalian cells with decreased Dicer expression as a result of decreased efficiency of DNA damage repair and other mechanisms. For example, siRNA from double strand breaks (produced by Dicer) may act as guides for protein complexes involved in the double strand break repair mechanisms and can also direct chromatin modifications. Additionally, miRNAs expression patterns change as a result of DNA damage caused by ionizing or ultraviolet radiation. RNAi mechanisms are responsible for transposon silencing and in their absence, as when Dicer is knocked out/down, can lead to activated transposons that cause DNA damage. Accumulation of DNA damage may result in cells with oncogenic mutations and thus the development of a tumor. = Other conditions = Multinodular goiter with schwannomatosis has been shown to be an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in this gene.Rivera B, Nadaf J, Fahiminiya S, Apellaniz-Ruiz M, Saskin A, Chong AS, Sharma S, Wagener R, Revil T, Condello V, Harra Z, Hamel N, Sabbaghian N, Muchantef K, Thomas C, de Kock L, H√©bert-Blouin MN, Bassenden AV, Rabenstein H, Mete O, Paschke R, Pusztaszeri MP, Paulus W, Berghuis A, Ragoussis J, Nikiforov YE, Siebert R, Albrecht S, Turcotte R, Hasselblatt M, Fabian MR, Foulkes WD (2019) DGCR8 microprocessor defect characterizes familial multinodular goiter with schwannomatosis. J Clin Invest = Viral pathogenesis = Infection by RNA viruses can trigger the RNAi cascade. It is likely dicer is involved in viral immunity as viruses that infect both plant and animal cells contain proteins designed to inhibit the RNAi response. In humans, the viruses HIV-1, influenza, and vaccinia encode such RNAi suppressing proteins. Inhibition of dicer is beneficial to the virus as dicer is able to cleave viral dsRNA and load the product onto RISC resulting in targeted degradation of viral mRNA; thus fighting the infection. Another potential mechanism for viral pathogenesis is the blockade of dicer as a way to inhibit cellular miRNA pathways. = In insects = Insects can use Dicer as a potent antiviral. This finding is especially significant given that mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many viral diseases including the potentially deadly arboviruses: West Nile virus, dengue fever and yellow fever. While mosquitoes, more specifically the Aedes aegypti species, serve as the vectors for these viruses, they are not the intended host of the virus. Transmission occurs as a result of the female mosquito's need for vertebrate blood to develop her eggs. The RNAi pathway in insects is very similar to that of other animals; Dicer-2 cleaves viral RNA and loads it onto the RISC complex where one strand serves as a template for the production of RNAi products and the other is degraded. Insects with mutations leading to non-functional components of their RNAi pathway show increased viral loads for viruses they carry or increased susceptibility to viruses for which they are hosts. Similarly to humans, insect viruses have evolved mechanisms to avoid the RNAi pathway. As an example, Drosophila C virus encodes for protein 1A which binds to dsRNA thus protecting it from dicer cleavage as well as RISC loading. Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3a encodes an RNase III enzyme similar to the RNase III domains of dicer which may compete for dsRNA substrate as well as degrade siRNA duplexes to prevent RISC loading. Diagnostic and therapeutic applications Dicer can be used to identify whether tumors are present within the body based on the expression level of the enzyme. A study showed that many patients that had cancer had decreased expression levels of Dicer. The same study showed that lower Dicer expression correlated with lower patient survival length. Along with being a diagnostic tool, Dicer can be used for treating patients by injecting foreign siRNA intravenously to cause gene silencing. The siRNA was shown to be delivered in two ways in mammalian species such as mice. One way would be to directly inject into the system, which would not require Dicer function. Another way would be to introduce it by plasmids that encode for short hairpin RNA, which are cleaved by Dicer into siRNA. One of the advantages of using Dicer to produce siRNA therapeutically would be the specificity and diversity of targets it can affect compared to what is currently being used such as antibodies or small molecular inhibitors. In general, small molecular inhibitors are difficult in terms of specificity along with unendurable side effects. Antibodies are as specific as siRNA, but it is limited by only being able to be used against ligands or surface receptors. On the other hand, low efficiency of intracellular uptake is the main obstacle of injection of siRNA. Injected SiRNA has poor stability in blood and causes stimulations of non-specific immunity. Also, producing miRNA therapeutically lacks in specificity because only 6-8 nucleotide base pairing is required for miRNA to attach to mRNA. Dicer-like proteins Plant genomes encode for dicer like proteins with similar functions and protein domains as animal and insect dicer. For example, in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, four dicer like proteins are made and are designated DCL1 to DCL4. DCL1 is involved with miRNA generation and sRNA production from inverted repeats. DCL2 creates siRNA from cis-acting antisense transcripts which aid in viral immunity and defense. DCL3 generates siRNA which aids in chromatin modification and DCL4 is involved in trans-acting siRNA metabolism and transcript silencing at the post-transcriptional level. Additionally, DCL 1 and 3 are important for Arabidopsis flowering. In Arabidopsis, DCL knockout does not cause severe developmental problems. Rice and grapes also produce DCLs as the dicer mechanism is a common defense strategy of many organisms. Rice has evolved other functions for the 5 DCLs it produces and they play a more important role in function and development than in Arabidopsis. Additionally, expression patterns differ among the different plant cell types of rice while expression in Arabidopsis is more homogeneous. Rice DCL expression can be effected by biological stress conditions including drought, salinity, and cold, thus, these stressors may decrease a plants viral resistance. Unlike Arabidopsis, loss of function of DCL proteins causes developmental defects in rice.

The Lyon was built as Mormactide under a Maritime Commission (MC) contract by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Company of Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was laid down 21 August 1939, and was launched on 12 October 1940; sponsored by Gloria McGehee. Mormactide was the third ship to be built by Ingalls for Moore-McCormack Lines and was designed specifically for the South American trade. The ship was completed in April 1941 and turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for wartime operation in March 1942 when it was operated by Moore- McCormack for the WSA under a United States Army Transportation Corps agreement. In August the ship was transferred to the Custody of the War Department. On 20 August 1942 the ship was acquired by the Navy and was renamed the Lyon after Mary Lyon, the founder of Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Female Seminary). (See also List of U.S. military vessels named after women.) The Lyon was transferred for conversion to the Atlantic Basin Iron Works of Brooklyn, New York on 13 September 1942. The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1942, with Captain M.J. Gillan in command. After the ship's service in World War II, the ship was decommissioned on 3 May 1946, and was returned to her owners, Moore-McCormack Lines. In 1966 the ship was acquired by Grace Lines and renamed the Santa Regina. Pre-World War II Mormactide was the second ship designed for Moore-McCormack's South American trade equipped with a cargo air conditioning system and the third ship to be built by Ingalls for the line. The ship, a MC type C3 hull numbered 65, Ingalls hull 255 was assigned official number 240348 and completed on 10 April 1941. Mormactide was turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for wartime operation on 10 March 1942. Mormactide was operated by Moore-McCormack for WSA under a standard Army Transportation Corps agreement until 8 August 1942 when the ship was transferred to the Custody of the War Department. On 13 September 1942 the Navy acquired Mormactide under a bareboat charter from WSA. World War II After being turned over to the Navy, she completed conversion to an AP, ship, on 20 September 1942. The Lyon departed from Newport News, Virginia on 22 October 1942 to assist in the invasion of French Morocco, taking part in the largest assembly of ships ever assembled at the time. The Lyon safely crossed the Atlantic Ocean, encountering none of the U-boats which were a major danger at the time. The ship arrived at Safi on 7 November. While ships of the western task force of Operation Torch silenced French shore batteries and naval resistance, troops of the western pincer were landed to trap the retreating Afrika Korps of General Erwin Rommel, the \\"Desert Fox\\". Though a cease-fire was negotiated on 11 November, German U-boats interfered, and torpedo attacks began 10 November. Since the 15 transports and cargo ships anchored in Fedhala Roads offered a target, they were removed to the security of Casablanca. The Lyon was part of a convoy that sailed for the United States on 15 November, and arrived back in Norfolk on the 24 November. From 13 December 1942 to 11 March 1943, Lyon made two voyages between New York City and Oran, Algeria, transporting reinforcements for the campaign in North Africa. The ship was then ordered to duty with Atlantic Amphibious Force for several weeks, and returned to Africa on 23 May to participate in amphibious training exercises until 28 June. Lyon next departed Mers el Kebir, Algiers on 6 July, with units of the Army's 1st Infantry Division for the assault on Gela, Sicily. The troops on the Lyon disembarked safely in stormy weather on 10 July for the initial advance into what had been called Europe's \\"soft underbelly\\". The vessel sailed from the battle area on 12 July and arrived back in Algeria three days later to prepare for the next assignment, the Salerno landings. Operation Avalanche was launched on 9 September. The landings were successful despite heavy enemy fire, air attacks, and complications resulting from a false report of Italy's surrender. The Lyon returned to Oran on 14 September and for the next two months reinforced American forces fighting in the Naples area. The ship departed the Mediterranean Sea on 7 November and arrived in New York City on 21 November for overhaul. In January 1944, the Lyon transported 2,000 Army Air Corps and Army Medical Corps personnel to Scotland, returning to New York City on 28 January. The Lyon then departed for North Africa via England, making two voyages to Naples before beginning five months of training. She sailed from Naples on 13 August as part of a combined British-French-United States operation to land in the St. Tropez area of southern France. Lyon received her fourth battle star here where the Allied landings overwhelmed opposition at this \\"back door\\" to Europe. The ship continued to reinforce these landings until 24 October when she again departed for New York. Arriving 8 November, she prepared for Pacific duty, and sailed from New York on 26 December. Lyon embarked combat forces in San Francisco in January 1945, and departed for the invasion of Okinawa. Lyon successfully completed her role in this major attack in the face of kamikaze attacks, and returned to San Francisco on 21 May. She departed Seattle, Washington, on 2 June to reinforce Okinawa, sailing via Honolulu, Eniwetok, and Ulithi. Lyon arrived off Okinawa on 14 July and was immediately forced out to sea by a typhoon. For two days her convoy was exposed to enemy submarine and kamikaze attacks, but the proximity of Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s 3rd Fleet diverted potential attackers. She returned to Okinawa on 21 July and embarked veteran marines bound for Guam to prepare for the planned assault on the Japanese home islands. She returned to the west coast on 14 August. Lyon received five battle stars for World War II service. After World War II After two voyages to the Far East between August and November transporting occupation troops and returning veterans, Lyon arrived in San Francisco on 3 February 1946. She departed Oakland, California, on 2 March with 1,000 German prisoners of war bound for Liverpool, England, and returned to New York on 12 April. She decommissioned on 3 May 1946 and was returned to her owners, the Moore-McCormack Lines, and her original name. On 3 May 1946 the ship returned to operation by Moore-McCormack under a WSA agreement as Mormactide until 6 November when the ship was redelivered to the line. The ship remained under the ownership of Moore-McCormack Lines until August 1966 when she was sold to Grace Lines and renamed Santa Regina. On 18 January the ship was sold by the then Prudential-Grace Lines to Dah Young Steel Manufacturing Co., LTD for scrapping in Taiwan.

Early life Born in Yukon, Oklahoma Territory, Albertson was one of four sons born to Rhoda and Earl Albertson. In 1909, before he was three, the family moved west to Caldwell, Idaho. After graduation from Caldwell High School in 1925, Albertson studied business for two years at the College of Idaho in Caldwell. Career While in college in 1927, he began his career in the grocery industry as a clerk at a local Safeway grocery store. On the final day of 1929, he married his college classmate Kathryn McCurry, of Boise, Idaho. They had one daughter, Barbara Jean Albertson Newman (1933‚Äì2012). Albertson quickly moved through the ranks with Safeway, until he was supervising more than a dozen stores. But he was not satisfied and wanted to start his own store‚Äîone that he could build to his own specifications and manage his own way. With $5,000 of the money he and Kathryn had saved, and with $7,500 borrowed from his wife's aunt, Albertson formed a partnership with L.S. Skaggs, a former Safeway division manager, and Tom Cuthbert, Skaggs' accountant. At the age of thirty-two, Albertson opened his first store in 1939 on three principles: quality, good value, and excellent service. Albertson is credited as being one of the pioneers of the complete one-stop, self-service supermarket concept. The first store was located at Sixteenth and State Streets in Boise, and he opened his second and third Albertsons stores in Nampa and Caldwell in 1940. During the years of World War II, when food was being rationed, he filled the empty shelves with health and beauty products, general household goods, and other non-food items. Albertson's reputation for generosity and community involvement grew during those war years. His stores promoted war bonds and sponsored scrap drives that collected aluminum, steel, fats, and paper for recycling. During the 1950s and 1960s, Albertson's expanded and became a familiar name to shoppers throughout the western United States. It grew to be a chain of over six hundred stores. At age 70, he stepped down as chairman of the board in 1976. Albertson's generosity continued throughout the years. The College of Idaho received many donations from Joe and Kathryn. It was named Albertson College of Idaho for sixteen years from 1991 to 2007. Perhaps the most obvious gift to the citizens of Idaho is the Kathryn Albertson Park in Boise, with its winding walkways, wildflowers, trees and ponds. J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation In 1966, Joe and Kathryn established the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation as a way to administer their own charitable giving.http://jkaf.org They focused their giving primarily on education, which was important to Joe and Kathryn because neither was able to finish college during the Great Depression. Since then, the foundation has given more than $240 million to Idaho's communities and education systems. The foundation continues to give to charities, primarily in areas where Joe and Kathryn lived or worked in Idaho.

One twip is 1/1440 inch, or 17.64 Œºm.  In computing  Twips are screen-independent units to ensure that the proportion of screen elements are the same on all display systems. A twip is defined as being 1/1440 of an inch (approximately 0.0176 mm). A pixel is a screen-dependent unit, standing for 'picture element'. A pixel is a dot that represents the smallest graphical measurement on a screen. Twips are the default unit of measurement in Visual Basic (version 6 and earlier, prior to VB.NET). Converting between twips and screen pixels is achieved using functions such as TwipsPerPixelX and TwipsPerPixelY. Twips are a commonly used unit with Symbian OS bitmap images and are also used internally in SWF format. They are also used in Rich Text Format from Microsoft for platform-independent exchange and they are the base length unit in OpenOffice.org and its fork LibreOffice.

It is intended to fill the role of a versatile, lightweight all-around rifle as specified in Jeff Cooper's scout rifle concept. Apart from the barrel and action, it is made primarily of polymers and is designed to be accurate to at least 300‚Äì400 meters. The Steyr Scout is also available in 5.56 NATO (.223 Remington), .243 Winchester, 6.5 Creedmoor, .376 Steyr and 7mm-08 Remington. Overview The Steyr Scout has the following features: * Removable box magazines with a magazine cut-off, individual rounds can be manually loaded through the ejection port, allowing for the magazine to be kept in reserve. * Second spare magazine stored in the butt of the rifle. * Light weight due to aluminium receiver housing, hammer forged fluted barrel, and extensive use of polymers. * Top integral Weaver rail. * Bottom UIT rail at the forend. * Roller tang safety with \\"Locked Safe\\", \\"Loading\\" and \\"Fire\\" positions. * Bolt handle locks downward against receiver in \\"Locked Safe\\" mode. * User-adjustable trigger, factory set at . * Reserve flip-up \\"ghost ring\\" iron sights. * Integral folding bipod. * Third attachment point for a \\"Ching sling\\". There were early reports of problems with the Steyr Scout rifle relating to breakage of the bipod pivot pin. The affected part was subsequently redesigned to improve its strength. Some shooters complained that the bipod was too tall. The Weaver rail above the action and barrel allows either for conventional positioning of a scope with normal 1.5‚Äì3.5 in eye relief or for the forward placement of an intermediate/long eye relief \\"scout scope\\". The latter is more faithful to Cooper's Scout concept, and the Steyr-Mannlicher rifle can be ordered from the factory with a low-magnification Leupold scope with long eye relief.  Variants  = Steyr Elite = The Steyr Elite in 7.62 NATO A variant and effectively the successor of the Scout is the Steyr Elite (previously known as the Steyr Tactical Elite), a more robustly constructed model with many of the same features of the Scout, but designed primarily for the law enforcement market for an urban tactical role. Differences to the standard Scout include an extended STANAG type mounting rail, an enlarged bolt knob of the SSG type, an adjustable cheek piece, and a height-adjustable buttpad. It is fitted with a heavy barrel, and can produce high muzzle velocities due to a \\"fast\\" internal profile. The additional features of the Elite give it a weight of over , which makes it fall outside the definition of a scout rifle. Although intended for intermediate ranges, with match grade 7.62 mm (.308 inch) ammunition and 10.0 g (155 grain) projectiles, entirely acceptable performance at up to has been recorded, making it a good all-rounder. It is standard with a synthetic 5-round magazine, but an external adaptor kit can be attached to fit a 10-round magazine (not available on 5.56 NATO). It is normally available in two calibers; 5.56 NATO and 7.62 NATO, but can be specially ordered in 7 mm-08 Remington upon request. = Steyr Scout RFR = Also referred to as the Scout Survival, the Scout RFR is the rimfire version of the Scout, with three caliber choices of .17 HMR, .22 LR and .22 WMR. It is a new addition to the lineup, formally introduced in the 2017 SHOT Show. The RFR has an ISSC SPA- style \\"toggle\\" straight-pull action and a UNF 1/2\\"-20 threaded (except the .22 WMR version) heavy blued barrel, with an overall rifle length of and weighing . It comes with a 10-round metal box magazine, and an optional survival knife that can be hidden in the storage cavity in the buttstock. It has a full- length Picatinny rail over the handguard in front of the receiver, which has dovetail grooves but includes two Weaver-style adaptor bases for mounting optics. Unlike the centerfire models, which have three attachment points for using Ching slings, the RFR only has two attachment points for using conventional slings.

Founded in 1885 as a Catholic seminary, it is named after Thomas Aquinas, the medieval Catholic theologian and philosopher who is the patron saint of students. St. Thomas currently enrolls nearly 10,000 students, making it Minnesota's largest private, non-profit university. History Founded in 1885 by John Ireland, archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, St. Thomas began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. In 1894, the liberal arts program became an independent college through a gift from local railroad tycoon James J. Hill, who provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity apart from the college. In 1903, the College of St. Thomas established a military program on campus, and it was officially termed a military school by the U.S. War Department in 1906. Initially, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs before awarding its first academic degrees in 1915. In 1922, military training became optional. From the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the Holy Cross Fathers, who run the University of Notre Dame, controlled the college's administration. The diocese called those priests in to help with the school's financial problems; those priests were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During World War II, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established \\"Tom Town\\" on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently the site to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library and O'Shaughnessey Education Center. Tom Town, made of 20 double-dwelling huts, consisted of white, barrack-like housing units for faculty, students and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after World War II. In the latter half of the 20th century, St. Thomas started two of its most notable graduate programs: Education in 1950 and Business Administration in 1974. The school became co-educational in 1977 and although women were not allowed to enroll until then, female students from St. Catherine University (then the College of St. Catherine) often took classes at St. Thomas. Women were also present as instructors and administrators on campus but the staff, faculty, and administration has seen a vast increase in female employment since the move to co-education. In 1990, the College of St. Thomas became the University of St. Thomas and the following year, the university opened the Minneapolis campus. In 2001, St. Thomas reinstated its School of Law at its Minneapolis Campus; it had been shut down during the Great Depression. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the speaker at the Grand Opening. Campuses =Saint Paul= Arched entryway to the St. Paul campus The St. Paul campus is the main campus and is home to most undergraduate students. The main campus, built on a farm site once considered \\"far removed from town\\", is located where St. Paul's Summit Avenue meets the Mississippi River. The site was farmed by ex-Fort Snelling soldier William Finn, who received the property as a pension settlement after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while on guard duty. The western edge of the campus borders the Mississippi Gorge Regional Park. Summit Avenue, which runs through the middle of the campus, is the country's longest span of Victorian homes. This tree-lined avenue includes the Governor's Mansion, F. Scott Fitzgerald's townhome, and James J. Hill's mansion. Murray-Herrick Center In 2005, a new apartment-style residence hall was built on an existing parking lot. McNeely Hall was also built the following year. It is a large classroom building for business that replaced the smaller building of the same name. A new residential village, more parking ramps, and general planning all have been negotiated successfully with the surrounding neighborhood. These developments are expected to begin within the next five years. In early 2012, St. Thomas completed the final stage of its three building expansion on the St. Paul campus. The two main additions that were completed are the Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center (AARC) and the Anderson Student Center. These projects were completed in the summer of 2010 and January 2012, respectively. The Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center has a field house, basketball arena, weight room, and swimming pool. The track in the field house is home to the most dominant track team in the MIAC conference. Other St. Thomas sports that use the AARC's facilities have also had recent success, including a playoff run for the football team, and a national championship for the men's basketball team. The new Anderson Student Center is home to new food venues as well as entertainment options including a game room and a bowling alley, and a coffee shop. An art gallery on the second floor is home to the American Museum of Asmat Art. =Minneapolis= Downtown Minneapolis Campus In fall 1992, the university opened a permanent campus at 1000 LaSalle Ave. in Minneapolis. The first building, named Terrence Murphy Hall in May 2000, is headquarters to the university's Opus College of Business. Artist Mark Balma created one of the largest frescoes in the United States on the arched ceiling of its atrium. The seven-panel, fresco was completed in the summer of 1994 and portrays the seven virtues discussed in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. The Minneapolis campus also holds St. Thomas' School of Education, the School of Law, and Schulze School of Entrepreneurship. =Daniel C. Gainey Conference Center (Owatonna)= On May 15, 2014, it was announced that the Daniel C. Gainey Conference Center was sold to Meridian Behavioral Health, LLC with a plan to convert it to a treatment facility for addiction and behavioral disorders. The deal closed in August 2014. The deal included the entire 180 acre property and all the buildings except for the Winston Guest House, which was designed by architect Frank Gehry. St. Thomas is still exploring options for the house which will remain on the Gainey property for up to two years.http://www.southernminn.com/owatonna_peoples_press/article_84ed2764-6c61-5be4-a30c-1f1da8aa231a.html Deadline set on Winton House move: University has two years after sale of Gainey Center September 30, 2014 Retrieved October 23, 2014 Terms were not disclosed.http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2014/05/15/university-of- st-thomas-owatonna-conference-center.html?page=all University of St. Thomas finds buyer for Owatonna conference center May 15, 2014 Retrieved October 23, 2014 =Bernardi (Rome)= Since 1999, the University of St. Thomas has been the only university in the United States to have a formal affiliation with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum).Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, Handbook of Studies 2012- 2013, p. 303 http://www.pust.it/ Academics Frey Science and Engineering Center Each year the university awards almost 2,500 degrees including five different bachelor's degrees (B.A., B.M., B.S., B.S.M.E. and B.S.E.E.). There are 88 major fields at the undergraduate level, with 59 minor fields of study and seven pre-professional programs. At the graduate and professional level, the university offers 41 master's degrees, two education specialist, one juris doctor and five doctorates. =Schools and colleges= The university offers its degree programs through nine divisions. The College of Arts and Sciences includes undergraduate departments in the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences, plus a number of interdisciplinary programs. The Opus College of Business has seven departments offering graduate and undergraduate curricula including Executive Education and Professional Development at University of St. Thomas, and is one of six AACSB accredited business schools in Minnesota. St. Thomas also houses the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, which offers master's- and doctoral-level degrees oriented to theological study and the practice of ministry. St. John Vianney Seminary, a minor college seminary, is also at St. Thomas. Other schools include the School of Education, the School of Engineering, and the School of Social Work. The Master of Social Work is offered as a double degree program with the St. Catherine University. School of Law Schools housed on the Minneapolis campus include the Graduate School of Professional Psychology, Undergraduate and Graduate Schools of Education, Graduate Programs in Software Engineering, and the School of Law, which was re-opened in 1999 after a 66-year hiatus. The University of St. Thomas is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC), a consortium of five private liberal arts colleges. This program allows students to take classes at one of the associated colleges for no additional cost. Other schools include Hamline University, St. Catherine University, Macalester College, and Augsburg University. In 2017, St. Thomas was named a Changemaker Campus by joining AshokaU, a higher education consortium that focuses on social innovation in higher education. Athletics Johnnie football in 2005 Carleton in 2006 St. Thomas's school colors are purple and gray, and the athletic teams are called the Tommies. The mascot for these teams is \\"Tommie\\". \\"Tommy\\" was changed to the \\"ie\\" spelling when women were accepted as full-time students, to be more inclusive. St. Thomas is a member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC), which performs at the NCAA Division III level. Since 1885, athletics have been present on St. Thomas' campus. The first sports teams that became popular were intramural. The top intramural baseball teams in the 1890s were the \\"Blues\\" and \\"Grays\\", which is where the school colors come from. Varsity sports did not begin until 1904. St. Thomas celebrated its 100th year of varsity athletics in 2003‚Äì2004. St. Thomas' longtime archrival is Saint John's University from Collegeville, Minnesota. Recent national titles include men's basketball in 2011 and 2016; men's baseball in 2009 and 2001; women's softball in 2005 and 2004; men's lacrosse (MCLA Division II) in 2019, 2016, 2013, 2012, 2010 and 2009; women's volleyball in 2012; and dance team in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2008 and 2006. St. Thomas also won national championships with women's basketball in 1991; men's cross country in 1986 and 1984; men's indoor track in 1985; and women's cross country in 1987, 1986, 1984 and 1982. In 2012, St. Thomas played for the first time in the Stagg Bowl in Salem, Virginia, which is the Division III Football National Championship game, against the University of Mount Union, losing 28-10. In 2015, St. Thomas reached the Stagg Bowl for the second time, prompting another championship match against Mount Union. St. Thomas ultimately ended up losing the game, with a final score of 49-35. WCCO has broadcast radio coverage of Tommies football games since 2011. On May 22, 2019 it was announced that St. Thomas was \\"involuntarily removed\\" from the MIAC. St. Thomas will be allowed to remain as a member of the conference until the spring of 2021 while they search for a new conference though they will be allowed to leave at an earlier date should a new conference accept them prior to spring 2021 or should they decide to become an independent. On October 4, 2019, St. Thomas announced that it had been invited to the Summit League, an NCAA Division I conference. This announcement also noted that St. Thomas has applied for a waiver from the NCAA to move directly from Division III to Division I beginning with the 2021-22 season. While the process of transitioning from Division III to Division I normally takes twelve years, on July 15, 2020, the NCAA announced they had approved St. Thomas's application to move directly to Division I. As the Summit League does not sponsor football or ice hockey, St. Thomas will join the Pioneer Football League for football, the CCHA for men's hockey and the WCHA for women's hockey. Student life =Student housing= Cretin Hall, built in 1894 Undergraduate housing is found on the St. Paul Campus. Approximately 2,400 residents live in 10 traditional halls and apartments. Additionally, St. John Vianney College Seminary holds approximately 140 students. All but one (Murrary Herrick) traditional halls are single-sex, while apartment residences are co-ed by floor. Residence halls on campus are named after Archbishops of St. Paul-Minneapolis, such as William O. Brady, Austin Dowling, and John Ireland. The all-female traditional hall of John Paul II is named after the former Pope. Built in 1894, Cretin Hall is the oldest hall on campus and was designed (along with Loras and Grace halls) by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray. Recently the department of residence life has purchased additional buildings on what they are calling 'mid-campus' in the area between Grand and Summit Avenues. These buildings house men and women transfer students in one of two buildings, separated by gender. There are two apartment complexes that are specifically designed for sophomores. Students are also housed in the residence above the Child Development Center, a day-care facility on campus. Morrison Hall is connected to Koch Commons with a skyway. The University of St. Thomas offers special interest floors, or floors that are intended to house specific residents with similar interests or class standing. Almost one-third of all floors are First Year Experience floors, which consist of only freshmen. This practice attempts to create a cohesive community by placing students together who will have a similar experience. First year students have the opportunity to participate in Living Learning Communities (LLCs). These include Sustainability, Aquinas Scholars, Tommies Do Well(ness), Pathways to Engineering, COJO MOJO, Bridging Divides, Catholic Studies, Major Explorers, and Business for the Common Good. Housing policies The campus is not dry: students over 21 years of age are allowed alcohol in their rooms. =Undergraduate Student Government= The on-campus student association is the Undergraduate Student Government (USG), formerly known as the ACC. The student government is made up of an executive board and general council. Each executive board member receives a stipend. The executive board consists of the president of the student body, executive vice president, vice president of financial affairs, vice president of academic affairs, vice president of administrative affairs and vice president of public relations. The general council consists of class presidents, class senators and representatives from various university organizations. The student government oversees funding to all clubs on campus, approves new club requests, appoints students to various university committees and represents the student body to the administration. USG has its own offices located in the student center. Elections are held in the fall and spring every academic year. Controversy =Desmond Tutu= In 2007, the president of the University of St. Thomas, Father Dennis Dease, cancelled a planned speech by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and anti-apartheid figure, Desmond Tutu, on the grounds that his presence might offend some members of the local Jewish community. Many faculty members of Voice for Peace led an email campaign calling on St. Thomas to reconsider its decision, which the president did and invited Tutu to campus. Tutu declined the re-invitation, speaking instead at the Minneapolis Convention Center at an event hosted by Metropolitan State University. However, he addressed the issue two days later while making his final appearance at Metro State. =Demolition of Foley Theater= In 2008, plans were announced to the public that the theater department at the University of St. Thomas was to be dissolved and that the school would no longer offer this major. Declining numbers of theater majors was publicly cited as the reason. However, during this same time, plans were underway to make space for a new student center to be named after the Anderson family, then the largest single donors to a single private institution in United States history. Despite protests from senior faculty and students, the decision was made to demolish the theater and dissolve the department the same semester; though, according to the Dean of St. Thomas's College of Arts and Sciences, Marisa Kelly, the two decisions were \\"completely unrelated\\".

The trunk is the most important part of the tree for timber production. Trunks occur both in \\"true\\" woody plants as well as non-woody plants such as palms and other monocots, though the internal physiology is different in each case. In all plants, trunks thicken over time due to formation of secondary growth (or in monocots, pseudo-secondary growth). Trunks can be vulnerable to damage, including sunburn. Trunks which are cut down during logging are generally called logs and if they are cut to a specific length bolts. The term \\"log\\" is informally used in English to describe any felled trunk not rooted in the ground. A stump is the part of a trunk remaining in the ground after the tree has been felled.  Structure of the trunk  The trunk consists of five main parts: the bark, inner bark, cambium, sapwood, and heartwood. From the outside of the tree working in, the first layer is the bark; this is the protective outermost layer of the trunk. Under this is the inner bark which is made of the phloem. The phloem is how the tree transports nutrients from the roots to the shoots and vice versa. The next layer is the cambium, a very thin layer of undifferentiated cells that divide to replenish the phloem cells on the outside and the xylem cells to the inside. The cambium contains the growth meristem of the trunk. Directly to the inside of this is the sap wood, or the living xylem cells. These cells transport the water through the tree. The xylem also stores starch inside the tree. Finally at the center of the tree is the heartwood. The heartwood is made up of old xylem cells that have been filled with resins and minerals that keep other organisms from growing and infecting the center of the tree.

He is known for the series of children's books he created with Ren√© Goscinny, Le petit Nicolas, and also for his poster-like illustrations, usually drawn from a distant or high viewpoint depicting detailed countrysides or cities. Biography =Early life= Semp√© was expelled from school as a young man, and then failed to pass exams for the post office, a bank and the railroad. He then found work selling tooth powder as a door-to-door salesman and also worked delivering wine by bicycle in the Gironde. After lying about his age, he joined the army in 1950, since it was \\"the only place that would give me a job and a bed,\\" he subsequently explained, and would occasionally get into trouble for drawing while he was supposed to be keeping watch during guard duty. After being discharged from the army, he moved to Paris and began working with Ren√© Goscinny. Semp√© has spent most of his life in Paris' Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s district. =Artistic career= Jean-Jacques Semp√© in 2016 by Olivier Meyer His career started in France within the context of the Franco-Belgian comics industry. His \\"mute\\" watercolors or single image sketches, where the characters speak in pictures or not at all (but somehow manage to convey a rich story) slowly gained international attention. He won his first award in 1952 which is given to encourage young amateur artists to turn professional. His work has appeared as the cover of The New Yorker magazine many times. Semp√©'s full page cartoons appeared in Paris Match for many years. In the 1950s, Semp√© became renowned for his creation of a character named Nicolas in his cartoons for Le Moustique, a comic book proposed by Ren√© Goscinny to Semp√©. Le Petit Nicolas appeared from 1954 in Le Moustique and Semp√© drew upon childhood influences and memories to illustrate the comic. In 1960, the comic Le Petit Nicolas was published in Pilote magazine. It was at the time unusual modern children's literature given that it is centered around the experience of the child, rather than an adult interpretation of the world. In general though, Semp√© rarely draws from life, and draws something every day, putting sketches aside when he gets bored with them.

This is analogous to the structure of a tree with one trunk and many branches. Examples of this include telephone systems and the two-way radios commonly used by police agencies. Trunking, in the form of link aggregation and VLAN tagging, has been applied in computer networking as well. A trunk is a single communications channel between two points, each point being either the switching center or the node.  Telecommunications  A trunk line is a circuit connecting telephone switchboards (or other switching equipment), as distinguished from local loop circuit which extends from telephone exchange switching equipment to individual telephones or information origination/termination equipment.Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 0-199 Trunk lines are used for connecting a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider.Versadial, Call Recording Terms/Definitions, last accessed 8 June 2015 When needed they can be used by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN, PRI or SIP. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial Central Office) trunks. In the UK and the Commonwealth countries, a trunk call was the term for long distance calling which traverses one or more trunk lines and involving more than one telephone exchange. This is in contrast to making a local call which involves a single exchange and typically no trunk lines. Trunking also refers to the connection of switches and circuits within a telephone exchange. Trunking is closely related to the concept of grading. Trunking allows a group of inlet switches at the same time. Thus the service provider can provide a lesser number of circuits than might otherwise be required, allowing many users to \\"share\\" a smaller number of connections and achieve capacity savings.Motorola, Trunking Communications Overview, last accessed 13 February 2005.  Computer networks  =Link aggregation= In computer networking, port trunking is the use of multiple concurrent network connections to aggregate the link speed of each participating port and cable, also called link aggregation. Such high-bandwidth link groups may be used to interconnect switches or to connect high-performance servers to a network. =VLAN= In the context of Ethernet VLANs, Avaya and Cisco use the term ' to mean carrying multiple VLANs through a single network link through the use of a trunking protocol. To allow for multiple VLANs on one link, frames from individual VLANs must be identified. The most common and preferred method, IEEE 802.1Q adds a tag to the Ethernet frame, labeling it as belonging to a certain VLAN. Since 802.1Q is an open standard, it is the only option in an environment with multiple-vendor equipment. Cisco also has a (now deprecated) proprietary trunking protocol called Inter-Switch Link which encapsulates the Ethernet frame with its own container, which labels the frame as belonging to a specific VLAN. 3Com used proprietary Virtual LAN Trunking (VLT) before 802.1Q was defined.  Radio communications  In two-way radio communications, trunking refers to the ability of transmissions to be served by free channels whose availability is determined by algorithmic protocols. In conventional (i.e., not trunked) radio, users of a single service share one or more exclusive radio channels and must wait their turn to use them, analogous to the operation of a group of cashiers in a grocery store, where each cashier serves his/her own line of customers. The cashier represents each radio channel, and each customer represents a radio user transmitting on their radio. Trunked radio systems (TRS) pool all of the cashiers (channels) into one group and use a store manager (site controller) that assigns incoming shoppers to free cashiers as determined by the store's policies (TRS protocols). In a TRS, individual transmissions in any conversation may take place on several different channels. In the shopping analogy, this is as if a family of shoppers checks out all at once and are assigned different cashiers by the traffic manager. Similarly, if a single shopper checks out more than once, they may be assigned a different cashier each time. Trunked radio systems provide greater efficiency at the cost of greater management overhead. The store manager's orders must be conveyed to all the shoppers. This is done by assigning one or more radio channels as the \\"control channel\\". The control channel transmits data from the site controller that runs the TRS, and is continuously monitored by all of the field radios in the system so that they know how to follow the various conversations between members of their talkgroups (families) and other talkgroups as they hop from radio channel to radio channel. TRS's have grown massively in their complexity since their introduction, and now include multi-site systems that can cover entire states or groups of states. This is similar to the idea of a chain of grocery stores. The shopper generally goes to the nearest grocery store, but if there are complications or congestion, the shopper may opt to go to a neighboring store. Each store in the chain can talk to each other and pass messages between shoppers at different stores if necessary, and they provide backup to each other: if a store has to be closed for repair, then other stores pick up the customers. TRS's have greater risks to overcome than conventional radio systems in that a loss of the store manager (site controller) would cause the system's traffic to no longer be managed. In this case, most of the time the TRS will automatically switch to an alternate control channel, or in more rare circumstances, conventional operation. In spite of these risks, TRS's usually maintain reasonable uptime. TRS's are more difficult to monitor via radio scanner than conventional systems; however, larger manufacturers of radio scanners have introduced models that, with a little extra programming, are able to follow TRS's quite efficiently.

Kennedy Street, near the center of Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The term \\"Harvard Square\\" is also used to delineate the business district and Harvard University surrounding that intersection, which is the historic center of Cambridge. Adjacent to Harvard Yard, the historic heart of Harvard University, the Square (as it is sometimes called locally) functions as a commercial center for Harvard students, as well as residents of western Cambridge and the western and northern neighborhoods and inner suburbs of Boston. These residents use the Harvard station, a major MBTA Red Line subway and bus transportation hub. In an extended sense, the name \\"Harvard Square\\" can also refer to the entire neighborhood surrounding this intersection for several blocks in each direction. The nearby Cambridge Common has become a park area with a playground, baseball field, and a number of monuments, several relating to the Revolutionary War.  Location  Aerial view of the Mass Ave/Brattle Street junction, with Harvard Yard at the right The heart of Harvard Square is the junction of Massachusetts Avenue and Brattle Street. Massachusetts Avenue enters from the southeast (a few miles after crossing the Charles River from Boston at MIT), and turns sharply to the north at the intersection, which is dominated by a large pedestrian space incorporating the current MBTA subway headhouse, an older subway headhouse building which formerly housed a newsstand, a visitor information kiosk, and a small open-air performance space (\\"The Pit\\"). Brattle Street and John F. Kennedy Street merge from the southwest, joining Massachusetts Avenue at \\"Nini's Corner\\", where another newsstand used to be located. The Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society main building forms the western streetwall at the intersection, along with a bank and some retail shops. =Nearby places= The walled enclosure of Harvard Yard is adjacent, with Harvard University, Harvard Extension School, Harvard Art Museums, Semitic Museum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and Museum of Natural History just short walks away. Other institutions in the general neighborhood include the Cambridge Public Library, Lesley University, the Longy School of Music, the Episcopal Divinity School, the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, American Repertory Theater, the Cooper-Frost-Austin House, the Hooper-Lee-Nichols House, and the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site. The high pedestrian traffic makes Harvard Square a gathering place for street musicians and buskers, who must obtain a permit from the Cambridge Arts Council. Singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, who attended nearby Tufts University, is known to have played here during her college years. Amanda Palmer, of The Dresden Dolls, regularly performed here as a \\"living statue\\". Another frequent performer over the years has been indie rock guitarist Mary Lou Lord. A small bronze statue of \\"Doo Doo\\" (a puppet created by Igor Fokin) sits at the corner of Brattle and Eliot streets, in honor of Fokin and all the street performers. The Flying Karamazov Brothers also performed regularly in Brattle Square.Justine Sutton, \\"Review: Flying Karamazov Brothers Take Act to New Heights\\", Noozhawk, October 27, 2009 = Other features = Until 1984, the Harvard Square stop was the northern terminus of the Red Line, and it still functions as a major transfer station between subway, bus, and trackless trolley. Automobile traffic can be heavy, and parking is difficult. Most of the bus lines serving the area from the north and west run through a tunnel adjacent to the subway tunnel. Originally built for streetcars (which last ran in 1958) and still used by trackless trolleys as well as ordinary buses, the tunnel lessens bus traffic in central Harvard Square, and lets buses cross the Square without encountering automobile traffic. The tunnel also allows safer and covered access between the subway and the buses. At the center of the Square is the old Harvard Square Subway Kiosk, now a newsstand, Out of Town News, stocking newspapers and magazines from around the world. A video of it appears in transitional clips used on CNN. A public motion art installation, Lumen Eclipse, has been introduced at the Tourist Information Booth showing monthly exhibitions of local, national and international artists. The offices of Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe, home of the radio show Car Talk The office of NPR's Car Talk radio show faces the square, with a stencil in the window that reads \\"Dewey, Cheetham & Howe,\\" the fictional law firm often referenced on the show. The popular show has referenced this by asking its viewers to send in answers to the \\"Puzzler\\" to \\"Puzzler Tower, Car Talk Plaza, Harvard Square, Cambridge (our fair city), MA 02238\\". The sunken region next to the newsstand and the subway entrance is called \\"The Pit\\". Its arena-like appearance attracts skateboarders and, more generally, young, high-school aged people from surrounding neighborhoods who are associated with countercultural movements such as the punk, hardcore, straight edge, and goth subcultures. The contrast between these congregants, and the often older and more conservatively dressed people associated with nearby Harvard University and the businesses in the Square, occasionally leads to tension. Also, Harvard sports teams and clubs, including the track teams and all-male social clubs, are known to make use of this contrast through encouraging or sometimes forcing their newest members to engage in humorous or humiliating performances in \\"The Pit\\" as part of these members' initiations into the group. The overall scene was later fondly recalled by singer songwriter Amanda Palmer as a hangout for \\"Cool People\\". Chess players in Harvard Square Across the street to the east of The Pit, an outdoor cafe features always-busy tables for chess players, including US Federation Life Master Murray Turnbull, who has displayed his \\"Play the Chessmaster\\" sign here since 1982. In the southwest area of the Square neighborhood, on Mount Auburn St, stands the Igor Fokin Memorial. This memorial, created by sculptor Konstantin Simun, pays tribute not only to the late \\"beloved puppeteer,\\" but to all street performers that are an integral part of the square, especially during summer months. A number of other public squares dot the surrounding streets, notably Brattle Square and Winthrop Square,Brattle Square, Harvard Square, and Winthrop Square are at the three corners of the triangular block formed by Brattle Street, JFK Street, and Mt. Auburn Street ‚Äì Brattle Square is at the triangular intersection of Brattle and Mt. Auburn, while Winthrop Square is at the southwest corner of Mt. Auburn and JFK. with a wide variety of street performers throughout the year. Brattle Street itself is home to the Brattle Theater (a non-profit arthouse theater) and the American Repertory Theater. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Park, one block further down JFK Street, is on the bank of the Charles River. Cambridge Common is two blocks north. The Square often attracts activists for unconventional political factions and has its share of panhandlers. Although Tom Magliozzi has derided it as \\"the bum capital of the world\\", it's also very likely one of the world's best places to people-watch, having many benches, terraces, and sidewalk restaurants and cafes dedicated for that purpose, and an affluent, ambient shopping population to sustain most anyone's interest. \\"The Garage\\" is a small, multi-story shopping mall, named thus because it was formerly a parking garage. The original car ramp has been preserved, and is a central feature of this adaptive reuse project. One of the main attractions in The Garage is a Newbury Comics store.  History  1873 Map of Harvard Square Although today a commercial center, the Square had famous residents in earlier periods, including the colonial poet Anne Bradstreet. = Transformation = Harvard Square from above, 1921 Discussions of how the Square has changed in recent years usually center on the gentrification of the Harvard Square neighborhood and Cambridge in general. The Square also used to be a neighborhood shopping center, including a grocery store (Sages) and a Woolworth's five and ten. Although a hardware store (Dickson Hardware at 26 Brattle Street) survives amid chain drug stores and bank branches, the Square is mainly a regional rather than neighborhood shopping destination, serving students and commuters. In 1981 and 1987 the Harvard Square Theater was converted into a multiplex cinema; it later became part of the Loews Cineplex Entertainment chain and then closed on July 8, 2012. During the late 1990s, some locally run businesses with long-time shopfronts on the Square--including the unusual Tasty Diner, a tiny sandwich shop open long hours, and the Wursthaus, a German restaurant with an extensive beer menu--closed to make way for national chains. Elsie's Lunch, a long-popular deli, has also closed; what remained of its small corner storefront space facing Lowell House on Mount Auburn Street is now occupied by an ATM. Another long-time restaurant, the 64-year-old Leo's Place, closed in December 2013 when the landlord of the property terminated their lease. The owners are hoping to reopen in a new location. The student co-op, the Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society (\\"The Coop\\", founded in 1882) is now managed by Barnes & Noble, though it is still overseen by a board elected by its membership of Harvard and MIT students and staff. Schoenhof's Foreign Books is owned by the French √âditions Gallimard. Major bookstores Paperback Booksmith, Reading International, and Barilari Books had closed by the end of the 1990s. WordsWorth Books at 30 Brattle Street closed in 2004, after 29 years as a fixture in the Square. In the same year, the famous Grolier Poetry Bookshop announced that it would be sold (although it survived under new management). Globe Corner Bookstore converted to an exclusively online business, serving its last walk-in customer on July 4, 2011. Harvard Square Following national trends, the former Harvard Trust Company has been absorbed into the national Bank of America through a series of mergers. The iconic Out of Town News is owned by the UK-based Hudson Group. Still, several establishments remain as longstanding, locally-run businesses with unique styles. Examples include Leavitt & Pierce tobacconists (est. 1883), Laflamme Barber Shop (est. 1898), Harvard Book Store (est. 1932), Cardullo's Gourmet Shoppe (est. 1950), Charlie's Kitchen (est. 1951), the Brattle Theater (est. 1953), the Hong Kong Chinese restaurant (est. 1954), Club Passim (est. 1958), Caf√© Pamplona (est. 1959), Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage (est. 1960), Dickson Brothers Hardware (est. 1961), Million Year Picnic comics (est. 1970), Algiers Coffee House (est. 1970), and Grendel's Den (est. 1971). Raven Used Books arrived in 2005, helping to preserve Harvard Square's reputation as a center for used and new book browsing and sales. A 2012 proposal suggested major changes to the pedestrian island in the heart of Harvard Square, including possible removal of the landmark Out of Town News kiosk. Reaction to the proposal was mixed, and no changes have been approved . In film and other media The 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus takes place in Harvard Square near the film's conclusion, after the Richard Benjamin character learns that his girlfriend, Brenda Potimkin (played by Ali MacGraw), an undergraduate at Radcliffe College, had left her diaphragm in the top drawer of her bureau at home for her mother to discover. The 1970 film Love Story, by the late Harvard University alumnus and Yale University professor of classics Erich Segal, takes place almost entirely in and around Harvard Square during its first two- thirds, while Harvard undergraduates Oliver Barrett and Jenny Cavalieri meet; finish college; get married; and Oliver goes to Harvard Law School while Jenny teaches school, living in a second-story walk-up in what looks like Watertown. The film continues to be screened annually to incoming freshmen at Harvard College during orientation week. The 1973 film The Paper Chase, set at Harvard Law School, features Harvard Square landmarks of its era, including the old Out of Town Newsstand, the old MBTA Harvard station kiosk with its \\"8 Minutes to Park Street\\" sign, and the now-defunct Kupersmith's Florists. The 1977 film Between the Lines features similar Harvard Square footage as well as aerial footage of the Back Bay. The 1994 film With Honors has a scene filmed in Harvard Square in which the Out of Town Newsstand is featured. In the scene, Monty approaches Simon as he (Simon) is attempting to sell newspapers he took out of a vending machine. Various parts of the 1997 film Good Will Hunting were filmed in and around Harvard Square, most notably at the former Tasty Sandwich Shop and the outdoor seating area of the square's largest Au Bon Pain caf√©. The 2005 documentary film Touching History; Harvard Square, the Bank, and The Tasty Diner chronicles the changing face of the Square, as a small diner (The Tasty) closes its doors to make way for a large retail space. Ben Affleck shot portions of his film The Town (2010) in Grendel's Den on Winthrop Street, locally famous in the 1970s for its chocolate fondue. The 2010 film The Social Network, about the Harvard student origins of Facebook, featured aerial footage of the area near Holyoke Center.

Mormacsun operated for Moore-McCormack from May 1941 until December 1941 when she came under the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for the duration of World War II. The ship operated with Moore-McCormack as the WSA agent, playing an important role in early supply of the Southwest Pacific, until transfer to the United States Navy September 1942 and commissioning as Florence Nightingale whereupon she became an Elizabeth C. Stanton-class transport ship. She was named for Florence Nightingale (1820‚Äì1910), the nursing pioneer, and is one of the few United States Navy ships named after a woman. The ship was returned to WSA in 1946 and then to Moore-McCormack operating as Mormacsun until sold to operate as Japan Transport and lastly as Texas. Construction and pre Navy operations Mormacsun was launched on 28 August 1940 by Moore Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Oakland, California sponsored by Miss Carlotta S. Chapman. She was delivered to Moore-McCormack Lines in May 1941 and placed under the War Shipping Administration on 20 December 1941 at San Francisco allocated to operate under U.S. Army charter by Moore-McCormack. The new ship, with 67 crated P-40s‚Äîmore aircraft than the larger could transport, was one of six ships involved in delivery of vitally needed pursuit aircraft intended for the Philippines and diverted to Australia during early February 1942. Mormacsun departed San Francisco unescorted on 26 December 1941 loaded with aircraft, ammunition and bombs, including 9.2 million .30 caliber rounds, almost 16,500 81 mm mortar rounds, 2,952 300-pound and 13,855 100-pound bombs. Outbound the ship was attacked by friendly aircraft but escaped without damage to arrive in Brisbane 19 January 1942. The ship was drafted into the effort to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines but was under orders to go no further than the Netherlands Indies to transship cargo to smaller vessels. The transfer of cargo destined for the Philippines was actually made from Mormacsun to two smaller vessels, the British Hanyang and Yochow of The China Navigation Company, at Perth but after the Bombing of Darwin those vessels returned to Australia where the supplies were unloaded. On 12 August 1942 in New York the ship was delivered to War Department custody awaiting bareboat charter and operation by the US Navy on 13 September 1942. Naval service history Florence Nightingale was commissioned 17 September 1942 as AP-70 with Captain E. D. Graves, Jr., in command. The ship sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 23 October 1942 in the task force bound for the invasion of North Africa, and between 8‚Äì15 November lay off Port Lyautey, Morocco, landing troops and cargo. Returning to Norfolk on 30 November, she made two voyages to Algeria, carrying reinforcements and cargo out, and prisoners of war back, returning to New York from the second, on 11 March 1943. After brief overhaul and exercising in Chesapeake Bay, Florence Nightingale sailed from Norfolk on 8 June with troops for the invasion of Sicily, landing them through hazardous surf conditions at Scoglitti from 10‚Äì12 July. Returning to New York on 3 August 1943, Florence Nightingale voyaged to Oran in September, and on 8 October sailed from New York for Belfast, Northern Ireland. She carried men from Glasgow, Scotland, to Iceland, before returning to Boston on 17 November to load for the first of two transport voyages to the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, from New York. Laden with soldiers and nurses, she sailed from New York on 27 February 1944 for Cardiff, where she landed her original passengers, then sailed to Belfast to embark soldiers for the Mediterranean Sea. From 21 March, she carried troops among Mediterranean bases, and took part in landing operations in preparation for the invasion of southern France, for which she sortied from Naples on 13 August. She landed her troops in the initial assault on 15 August, and returned with casualties to Naples three days later. Until 25 October, when she sailed for home, Florence Nightingale brought reinforcements from Oran to the fighting in southern France. Overhauled at New York from 8 November ‚Äì 18 December, Florence Nightingale loaded Marines at Norfolk, and with them arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945. Here she debarked the Marines and loaded soldiers and Army equipment for the Marianas. She sailed among these islands, transporting casualties, mail, and cargo to Guam, made one cargo voyage to Ulithi, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 March. On 7 April, again troop laden, she got underway for Okinawa, off which she lay to discharge reinforcements from 3‚Äì8 May, undergoing many air raids but suffering no damage. The transport reached San Francisco from action waters on 27 May 1945, and sailed 11 days later to carry men of naval construction battalions and their equipment to Okinawa. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 August to begin occupation transport duty, which found her calling at Eniwetok and Yokosuka before her return to Portland, Oregon, on 15 November. Between 21 November and 6 December 1945 the Florence Nightingale transported Project Paperclip V-2 rocket scientists, including Hans Lindenberg, from Le Havre to New York. Between 13 December and 16 February 1946, she again voyaged to the Far East, carrying occupation troops to Korea, and returning to Long Beach, California, with servicemen eligible for discharge. At Long Beach she loaded German prisoners of war, with whom she sailed for Liverpool, England, on 26 February. Landing the homeward- bound Germans in England for further transfer, Florence Nightingale embarked troops at Le Havre for transportation to New York City, where she docked on 8 April 1946. The transport was decommissioned on 1 May 1946 and transferred to the War Shipping Administration the same day. Florence Nightingale received four battle stars for World War II service. Commercial operation On 1 May 1946, the ship was delivered to Moore-McCormack Lines at Hoboken, New Jersey and operated for the line until sold to Pacific Transport Lines in July 1953 and renamed Japan Transport. The ship was then sold to States Steamship Co. August 1957 and renamed Texas. The ship was traded in to the government on 20 May 1966, placed in the Olympia, Washington reserve fleet until sold for scrap to Zidell Explorations on 2 November 1970.

Despite his part in the student rebellion of 1823, he received a medical degree from Harvard University in 1826. A practicing physician in Philadelphia, he became active as librarian and curator at the city's Academy of Natural Sciences. Pickering went with the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842 as one of its naturalists. Charles Wilkes, the expedition's commander, named Pickering Passage in honor of Charles Pickering. His journal of the Expedition was a major influence on Wilkes' Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition. From 1842-43, Pickering curated the collection from the Wilkes Expedition, which was housed at the Patent Office in Washington DC, these collections were to form the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution.Philbrick, Nathaniel. \\"The Scientific Legacy of the U.S. Exploring Expedition.\\" http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/usexex/learn/philbrick.htm} Pickering was a polygenist, he believed that different races had been created separately.

In 1848, Pickering published Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution, which enumerated eleven races. He later moved to Boston, where he resumed his medical practice, and eventually died on March 17, 1878. He was married to Sarah Stoddard Pickering, who posthumously published his final work.

In November 2010, Coke La Rock was inducted into the High Times Counterculture Hall of Fame at the annual ceremonies at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. Kool Herc and Coke La Rock Although it has been written that La Rock comes from Jamaica, he was born in The Bronx, New York City on April 24, 1955. Coke La Rock was a friend and musical partner of DJ Kool Herc, who himself is generally considered to have laid down the foundation for hip-hop music starting in 1973. La Rock was thus an original member of Herc's MC crew the Herculoids. According to Herc, Coke La Rock's MC name had various iterations, beginning as \\"A-1 Coke\\" and then moving on to \\"Nasty Coke\\" before it was finalized as \\"Coke La Rock\\". Coke La Rock joined Kool Herc for his first party, in 1973, to celebrate Herc's sister Cindy's birthday. It wasn't until about the fifth or sixth party that he took the name Coke La Rock. The name came to him in a dream. Before that time, he had no name and did his rapping out of sight from the audience, so no one knew who was doing the rapping. His original raps were usually shout-outs to friends, but gradually the poetry emerged. He originated such phrases as \\"You rock and you don't stop\\" and \\"Hotel, motel, you don't tell, we won't tell\\" (which was immortalized on the first Sugarhill Gang single \\"Rapper's Delight\\", although La Rock received no credit). Coke La Rock's raps were always purely improvisational, unlike those of later 70s-era rap groups--such as the Furious Five and Cold Crush Brothers, who wrote down and rehearsed their rhymes and created elaborate routines. According to La Rock, while rapping \\"at first I would just call out [my friends'] names. Then I pretended dudes had double- parked cars; that was to impress the girls. Truthfully, I wasn‚Äôt there to rap, I was just playing around.\\" Nonetheless, La Rock's raps would, as with much else at Kool Herc's parties in the mid-1970s, serve as a basic model for other hip-hop artists that would come onto the Bronx music scene by the end of the decade. La Rock himself has argued, in a reference to two pioneering New York City narcotics dealers, that \\"me and Herc were to hip-hop what Nicky Barnes and Frank Lucas were to drugs.\\" Decline in popularity and later years As other nascent hip-hop groups patterned themselves after Herc and La Rock and improved on their formula, the popularity of Herc and the Herculoids began to wane as early as 1977.Chang, 83-84. After Kool Herc was stabbed at a party, La Rock went looking to kill the perpetrator, who was part of the Executive Playhouse crew. He found the man's friends in a Bronx pool hall, but they had already moved their friend down south to avoid a confrontation. After this incident, La Rock decided to step away from hip hop and let the younger generation move in. Since he'd had a long run lasting several years of being on top of the Bronx hip hop scene, La Rock didn't want to continue if murder was going to continue to be part of the game. Also his son, Dante La Rock, had just been born, and he needed to spend more time at home. Gary Harris, an employee of the first hip-hop record label, Sugar Hill, noted that \\"people respected Herc and Coke, but by the early eighties those guys were like specters‚Äîthey just weren‚Äôt visible on the scene anymore.\\" In contrast to other early Bronx hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, Coke La Rock--like his partner Kool Herc--never achieved any recording success (indeed he did not record at all). However, late 2008 saw the release of what was deemed the first ever recording featuring La Rock, a song titled \\"Hello ‚Äì Merry Christmas Baby!\\" which was released by Sedgwick & Cedar as part of a special holiday compilation to pay homage to the birthplace of hip-hop. La Rock's place in hip-hop history was arguably immortalized in the legendary 1986 Boogie Down Productions song \\"South Bronx\\" (the opening salvo of the so- called \\"Bridge Wars\\") wherein KRS-One raps: > Now way back in the days when hip-hop began > With Coke La Rock, Kool Herc, and then Bam Coke La Rock had no association with, nor relation to, KRS-One's DJ at the time, Scott La Rock. Nor did Coke La Rock and another influential old-school MC, T La Rock, know one another in the early days of hip-hop, and thus the name similarity is coincidental.

It was released on April 3, 2001 on Lobster Records and is the first Yellowcard album to include Ryan Key as lead singer and guitarist. It was produced, engineered and mixed by Darian Rundall at Stall No. 2 in Redondo Beach, California. Six of the songs, \\"Drifting,\\" \\"Sureshot,\\" \\"Big Apple Heartbreak,\\" \\"Cigarette,\\" \\"October Nights,\\" and \\"A.W.O.L.,\\" are featured on Microsoft's snowboarding video game Amped 2 for Xbox. \\"Drifting\\" and \\"Rock Star Land\\" both originally appeared on the band's previous EP, Still Standing EP. The album was re-released on vinyl in 2012. Background The band moved from their native Florida to Thousand Oaks, California to record the album. After the album's release, the band embarked on their first full-length tour, alongside Rise Against and Mad Caddies. In a 2011 interview, violinist Sean Mackin described the album: \\"One for the Kids was a really big album for us. You have to understand, we started the band when we were 15, 16 years old. The first two albums before Ryan Key joined the band, we only printed 1,000 copies. We were just high school kids. When we decided to make a run at being in a band, we signed to a record label, Lobster Records. They had full distribution, and we started recording as a different style of band than when we first started. That was very punk-rock-focused, kind of extra adolescent? When Ryan joined the band, it brought a different kind of songwriting that allowed us to showcase our different sorts of influences. It's an important part of Yellowcard and, really, the version of our band that most people know.\\" Reception AllMusic stated the album is \\"full of hooks and catchy choruses as strong as any of the syrupy sweet punk bands around southern California.\\" and compared the sound of the album to Dave Matthews Band. Sputnikmusic praised the band's inclusion of the violin and stated the album was a \\"rough draft of Ocean Avenue\\". Exclaim! also praised the band's use of violin, stating \\"not since FM's Nash the Slash donned bandages has the electric violin been used so effectively in rock music.\\" as well as stating the album had \\"above average, melodic punk, fusing energy and enthusiasm with creative chord progressions, classically-inspired riffs and harmonies aplenty HM included the song \\"Something of Value\\" on the list of essential Yellowcard songs in a retrospective career review.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1993 until 2007, representing the electorate of Franklin. He sat as an Australian Labor Party representative from 1993 to 2007, when he was expelled from the party for failing to pay his membership dues. An outspoken maverick MP, he did not contest the 2007 federal election. He first entered politics in 1993 after winning the southern Tasmanian seat of Franklin in the House of Representatives. On the night of the 1993 federal election, Quick was the first member to become elected (mainly due to the daylight saving time difference), reclaiming Franklin for Labor, for the first time in 17 years. During the time he has been member for Franklin the one-time Liberal stronghold has become a reasonably safe Labor seat. Even in the 2004 federal election where all Tasmanian Labor members lost support, Quick's decline was the smallest. He was a teacher, education officer and electorate officer before entering politics. He worked for Senator Michael Tate prior to being elected to the House. He also protested against the 2003 Iraq war in which Australian troops took part. He once took a Tasmanian apple into the Federal parliament in protest against legalising the import of New Zealand apples which have been banned in Australia for 80 years because of bio-security risk reasons, notably the Fireblight disease. He opposed the 2005 Walker Corporation planned development at Ralphs Bay, Lauderdale near Hobart that the State Labor Government had hoped for. He has always believed that politicians should take a \\"hands on\\" role in the community. Quick was an Opposition Whip 2001‚Äì04. On 12 August 2005, Quick announced that he would not contest his seat at the next federal election, blaming what he called the party's left-right factional disputes and lack of a strong leader as the reasons for his retirement.

He has been a consultant editor at The Times Literary Supplement for many years, and a regular book reviewer for The Observer, The Sunday Times, The Independent, the Financial Times and The Guardian. He is the son of philosopher P. F. Strawson. He holds a chair in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Texas, Austin, and taught for many years prior to that at the University of Reading, City University of New York, and Oxford University. Biography Strawson, the elder son of Oxford philosopher P. F. Strawson, was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford (1959‚Äì65), where he won a scholarship to Winchester College (1965‚Äì68). He left school at 16, after completing his A-levels and winning a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he read Oriental Studies (1969‚Äì71), Social and Political Science (1971‚Äì72), and Moral Sciences (1972‚Äì73) before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an auditeur libre (audit student) at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris and at the Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne as a French Government Scholar (1977‚Äì78). Strawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as Fellow and Tutor of Jesus College, Oxford. In 1993, he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a Visiting Professor at NYU (1997), Rutgers University (2000), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2010) and the Ecole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales, Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, Princeton University (2011). In 2000, he moved to the University of Reading as professor of philosophy, and was also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the City University of New York Graduate Center. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the University of Texas, Austin as holder of a new Chair in Philosophy.\\"Leiter, Brian.\\" Free will In the free will debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether determinism is true or not. He argues for this position with what he calls his \\"basic argument\\", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us. In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus: # You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are. # To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are‚Äîat least in certain crucial mental respects. # But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all. # So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.Strawson, Galen. \\"Free Will \\" in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Edward Craig (1998); \\"The Bounds of Freedom\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Free Will, ed. Robert Kane (2002). This argument resembles Arthur Schopenhauer's position in On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, summarised by E. F. J. Payne as the \\"law of motivation, which states that a definite course of action inevitably ensues on a given character and motive\\".E. F. J. Payne, in his Translator's Introduction to Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation Panpsychism Strawson has argued that what he calls \\"realistic physicalism\\" (or \\"realistic monism\\") entails panpsychism.Strawson, G. (2006) \\"Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism\\", Journal of Consciousness Studies, Volume 13, Nos. 10‚Äì11, Exeter, Imprint Academic pp. 3‚Äì31 He writes that \\"as a real physicalist, then, I hold that the mental/experiential is physical.\\" He quotes the physicist Arthur Eddington in support of his position as follows: \\"If we must embed our schedule of indicator readings in some kind of background, at least let us accept the only hint we have received as to the significance of the background‚Äînamely that it has a nature capable of manifesting itself as a mental activity. The editor of the Journal of Consciousness Studies, Anthony Freeman, has written that panpsychism is regarded by many as either \\"plain crazy, or else a direct route back to animism and superstition\\".

He represented the Division of Swan, Western Australia in the Australian House of Representatives from 1996 to 1998, as well as the Division of Canning, Western Australia, from 2001 until his death in 2015. He was born in Merredin, Western Australia, and was educated at Graylands Teachers College, Perth. He was a teacher and marketing consultant before entering politics. Randall died of a heart attack while in office, and the 2015 Canning by-election was held in his seat. Electoral history Randall made his first run for office in 1993, when he ran in the safe state Labor seat of Belmont and was defeated by future opposition leader Eric Ripper. He was a member of the Belmont City Council 1993‚Äì96 before running in Swan in the 1996 election. He was initially slated to run against Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley. However, with Labor sinking in the polls, Beazley transferred to the slightly friendlier seat of Brand, and Randall won with a majority of 3.9 percent. He was defeated after only one term by Labor's Kim Wilkie. For the next election, Randall sought to run in Canning. The Labor incumbent, Jane Gerick, had been severely hurt by a redistribution which all but erased her majority, reducing it from 3.5 percent to only 0.4 percent. Randall was elected on a swing of 0.8 percent. Randall spent much of 2003 priming for a rematch against Gerick, but Gerick died of a cerebral brain hemorrhage in December 2003. Her replacement, Cimlie Bowden, resigned in early 2004 after accusing party insiders of undercutting her campaign. Labor then turned to former WA Deputy ALP leader Kay Hallahan, a former state MLA for Armadale, almost all of which is located in Canning. However, the instability on the Labor side crippled its chances, and Randall was reelected with a swing of 9.2 percent in his favour, technically making Canning a safe Liberal seat. Randall was re-elected to Canning at the 2010 election, defeating high-profile Labor candidate and former Labor MP, Alannah MacTiernan, though Canning was the only seat in Western Australia to record a two-party preferred swing to Labor. Randall was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott in September 2010. Controversy On 13 February 2008, Randall was one of six Liberal MPs not present when a motion was passed unanimously apologising to the stolen generations of indigenous children between federation and the 1970s. The others were fellow West Australian MPs Wilson Tuckey, Dennis Jensen and Luke Simpkins (as well as Sophie Mirabella and Alby Schultz) who chose to leave the house in protest to the apology to the Stolen Generations.The Australian, , retrieved February 2008 On 21 October 2010, Randall referred to Australia's public national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the \\"Gay-BC\\", in response to a journalist. On 15 June 2011 at a Friends of Mining lunch, Randall used the phrase 'pussy-whipped' to describe the mining industry's relationship with then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard. =Expenses scandal= Melbourne travel On 15 September 2012 Randall travelled to Melbourne, on a trip explained as being for 'sittings of Parliament' and which cost taxpayers $5300; the Australian Parliament, however, has not sat in Melbourne since 1927. Cairns travel In November 2012 Randall travelled to Cairns with his wife, for which he claimed more than $10,000 in travel expenses for 'electorate business'. The week after his return he took possession of an investment property in Cairns. The West Australian state Liberal MP Rob Johnson called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to 'dump' Randall over the trip. Prime Minister Abbott defended Mr Randall's travel claims, saying that Mr Randall was conducting 'very important discussions' with the then Chief Opposition Whip Warren Entsch. However, when quizzed by The Australian Financial Review, Mr Entsch refused to divulge the content of those discussions and admitted he did not know if they constituted \\"electorate business\\" as Mr Randall had claimed.: http://www.smh.com.au/federal- politics/political-news/very-important-discussions-tony-abbott-defends-don- randalls-cairns-trip-20131023-2w0aw.html#ixzz2icYgDond Liberal leadership spill motion On 9 February 2015 Randall seconded a federal Liberal Party leadership spill motion (moved by Luke Simpkins).

Anaconda Plan. (2011, May 9). Retrieved from Encyclopedia Virginia Web. 17 Oct. 2015 Proposed by Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, the plan emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two. Because the blockade would be rather passive, it was widely derided by a vociferous faction of Union generals who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war and likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim. The snake image caught on, giving the proposal its popular name. In the early days of the Civil War, Scott's proposed strategy for the war against the South had two prominent features. First, all ports in the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded. Secondly, a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy. A spearhead, a relatively-small amphibious force of army troops transported by boats and supported by gunboats, should advance rapidly, capturing the Confederate positions down the river in sequence. It would be followed by a more traditional army, marching behind to secure victories. The culminating battle would be for the forts below New Orleans. When they fell, the river would be in US hands from its source to its mouth, and the rebellion would be cut in two.ORA I, v. 51/1, pp. 369‚Äì370, 387  Description  Scott's plan had elements similar to a plan created before the Civil War. That antebellum plan was intended to crush a limited domestic insurrection by closing ports and using the army to pressure civilians to demand surrender. It was not intended to deal with a new political organization with a regular army.Carol Reardon, \\"The Military Experience,\\" in The Civil War Remembered, National Park Service Handbook, Virginia Beach, Virginia: The Donning Company Publishers, , 2011. The complete strategy could not be implemented immediately since no warships of the type imagined for the Mississippi campaign existed. The US Navy was also too small to enforce the blockade in the first months of the war. It would take time to gather and train the forces needed to carry out the Mississippi thrust, and the critics of the plan were unwilling to concede that time. Hence, Scott's plan was subjected to a great deal of ridicule. His opponents called for an immediate overland campaign directed primarily at the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Their stated belief was that if a few strongholds were taken, the Confederacy would collapse. The conflict was not the brief affair that Scott's critics had imagined. In the four years of the war, the US Navy enforced a blockade that certainly weakened the South, but its effect on the war effort is still debated. Furthermore, the Confederacy was split in two by a campaign based on the Mississippi River, and a consensus has now been established that the Southern defeat in the West contributed at least as much to the final collapse of the rebellion as the land battles in the East that had so long dominated the attention of both historians and the general public. The form of the Northern victory thus turned out to look very much like what Scott had proposed in the early days. Consequently, the Anaconda has been somewhat rehabilitated, and general histories of the Civil War often credit it with guiding President Abraham Lincoln's strategy throughout the period. Origin of plan The Anaconda had a logical development, both in its origin and the way it played out in the experience of battle. The blockade had already been proclaimed by Lincoln. On April 19, 1861, a week after the bombardment of Fort Sumter that marked the outbreak of the war, he announced that the ports of all the seceded states, from South Carolina to Texas, would be blockaded; later, when Virginia and North Carolina also seceded, their coastlines were added.ORN I, v. 4, pp. 156‚Äì157, 340. The executive order was not rescinded until the end of the war and so the blockade existed independently of Scott's plan. In the early days of the secession movement, the status of the border states Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware, all of which allowed slavery, was unclear.Virginia, also a border state, had already seceded by the time the Anaconda was proposed. All except Delaware had strong pro-Southern interests. Missouri was torn by internal conflict that mimicked in miniature the larger war that was convulsing the nation, Maryland was kept in the Union by jailing many of the opposition faction, and Kentucky tried to keep the peace by proclaiming its neutrality by aiding neither the North nor the South if both would agree to leave the state alone. Because Congress was not in session to authorize presidential initiatives to suppress the rebellion, the burden of raising troops for the war fell on the loyal state governments. Ohio was particularly active in doing so and early acquired the services of George B. McClellan, who was to serve as the commander of its militia, with rank Major General of Volunteers. In a few weeks, as the state militias were incorporated into the national service, the militias of Indiana and Illinois were added to his command. From this power base, he felt enabled on April 27, 1861, to write a letter to General Winfield Scott outlining his strategy.ORA I, V. 51/1, pp. 338‚Äì339. He proposed an immediate march on Richmond, by now the capital of the Confederacy, directed up the Kanawha River. Alternatively, if Kentucky were to leave the Union, a march directly across that state should take Nashville, and then, he would \\"act on circumstances.\\" Scott's endorsement of McClellan's letter, which he submitted to the President, shows that he considered it but not favorably. Firstly, the Kanawha was not suited for water transport and so the march on Richmond would have to be overland and thus subject to breakdowns of men, horses, and equipment. More seriously, western Virginia (West Virginia had not yet parted from Virginia) was still very much pro-Union; according to Scott's estimate, its populace stood five out of seven opposed to secession. An invasion as proposed would alienate many of them and subject both enemies and friends to the ravages of war. The same argument could be applied to Kentucky. Perhaps most damagingly, the war as proposed would subjugate the Confederacy piecemeal, with by necessity the border states bearing most of the burden, \\"instead of enveloping them all (nearly) at once by a cordon of ports on the Mississippi to its mouth from its junction with the Ohio, and by blockading ships on the sea board.\\"ORA I, v. 51/1, p. 339. The germ of Scott's Anaconda Plan for suppressing the insurrection is seen in the endorsement. In a few days, he had given it more thought, and he submitted his own proposal in a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861. A second letter, dated May 21, was his final outline of the plan. Scott was not able to impose his strategic vision on the government. Aged and infirm, he had to retire before the year was out. He was replaced as General-in-Chief by none other than George B. McClellan. Development of Mississippi River Battle of Vicksburg, by Kurz and Allison Under McClellan and his eventual successor in the West, Maj. Gen. Henry Wager Halleck, the Mississippi became a somewhat neglected theater for operations in the West. Halleck, with McClellan's approval, believed in turning the enemy's Mississippi River strongholds rather than attacking them directly, so he moved away from the river.ORN I, v. 22, pp. 700‚Äì701. As he saw it, the Tennessee rather than the Mississippi was the \\"great strategic line of the Western campaign.\\"ORA I, v. 10, p. 24. The Navy Department, however, remained committed to the idea of opening the Mississippi. In the person of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, it decided early on the capture of New Orleans by a naval expedition from the Gulf of Mexico, after which all other towns bordering the river would fall rather than face bombardment.Gideon Welles, \\"Admiral Farragut and New Orleans: with an account of the origin and command of the first three naval expeditions of the war,\\" The Galaxy, v. 12, pp. 669‚Äì683, 817‚Äì832 (November and December 1871). The task of taking New Orleans was entrusted to Captain (later Admiral) David Glasgow Farragut, who followed his own plans for the battle; running his fleet past the forts that defended the city from the south on the night of April 24, 1862, he forced the city to surrender.Dufour, Charles L., The night the war was lost, pp. 265‚Äì286. After repairing his ships from the damage they had suffered while passing the forts, he sent them up the river, where they successively sought and obtained the surrender of Baton Rouge and Natchez. The string of easy conquests came to an end at Vicksburg, Mississippi, however, as the Confederate position there occupied bluffs high enough to render them impregnable to the naval gunnery of the day. Following the loss of Island No. 10 shortly before Farragut took New Orleans, the Confederates had abandoned Memphis, Tennessee, leaving only a small rear guard to conduct a delaying operation. In early June, this was swept aside at the First Battle of Memphis by the gunboats of the Western Gunboat Flotilla (soon thereafter to be transformed into the Mississippi River Squadron) and the United States Ram Fleet, and the Mississippi was open down to Vicksburg. Thus that city became the only point on the river not in Federal hands.ORN I, v. 23, pp. 118‚Äì140. Again, the Army under Halleck did not grasp the opportunity that was provided. He failed to send even a small body of troops to aid the ships, and soon Farragut was forced by falling water levels to withdraw his deep-draft vessels to the vicinity of New Orleans.Shea and Winschel, Vicksburg is the key, pp. 17‚Äì18. The Army did not attempt to take Vicksburg until November, and then the Army was under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, after Halleck had been called to Washington to replace McClellan as General-in-Chief.Halleck was called to the East to become the new General-in-Chief in mid-July, about the time that Farragut had to leave Vicksburg. By the time that Grant became commander in the West, the Confederate Army had been able to fortify Vicksburg and Port Hudson to the south. This 130 mi stretch (210 km measured along roads, somewhat longer on the river), including the confluence of the Red River with the Mississippi, became the last contact between the eastern Confederacy and the Trans- Mississippi. Having no doubt of its importance, the government of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond strengthened both positions. Command at Vicksburg in particular passed from Brig. Gen. Martin L. Smith to Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton; the size of the defending army increased in step with the advancing rank of its commander.Shea and Winschel, Vicksburg is the key, pp. 20, 36. The campaign for Vicksburg eventually settled into a siege, which terminated on July 4, 1863, with Pemberton's surrender of all the forces under his command. At that time, his army numbered approximately 29,500 men.Shea and Winschel, Vicksburg is the key, p. 178. When word of the loss of Vicksburg reached the garrison at Port Hudson, Maj. Gen. Franklin Gardner, the commander there, knew that further resistance was pointless. On July 9, 1863, he surrendered the post and its garrison to the Federal Army of the Gulf and its commander, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks.Shea and Winschel, Vicksburg is the key, p. 200. Henceforth, in the phrase of Abraham Lincoln, \\"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\\" Development of blockade blockade runner at the entrance to Mobile Bay The Anaconda Plan as proposed by Scott relied on the blockade, as he stated it, \\"so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.\\"ORA I, 51/1, 369, 387. Insofar as he foresaw direct combat, it was to be more or less confined to the central thrust down the Mississippi River. Almost surely he did not anticipate the level of violence that it provoked. For that matter, the blockade itself had to be modified by events, provoking much of the bloodshed that he hoped to avoid. Scott's proposal for the blockade was not properly a strategy although it is often referred to as such by historians. It did not estimate the forces that would be needed to guard the at least 3000 mi (4800 km) of coastline in the seceded states. It did not consider an allocation of resources. It did not set out a timeline or even name points of particular concern. Much of that was later done by the Blockade Strategy Board, a group meeting at the request of the Navy Department but also with representatives from both the Army and the Treasury Department (Coast Survey).According to historian Rowena Reed, much of the impetus for the Blockade Board came from Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase; the US Revenue Service, which would be strongly affected by the blockade, was a part of the Treasury Department. See Reed, Rowena, Combined operations in the Civil War, p. 7. During the summer of 1861, the board issued a series of reports recommending how best to maintain the blockade, taking into account the topography of the coast, the relative merits of the various southern ports, the opposition likely to be encountered, and the nature of the ships that would be used by both sides. The board recommendations concerning the Gulf coast were rather rudimentary and largely ignored, but the blockade on the Atlantic coast followed their plan reasonably closely.ORN I, v. 12, pp, 195‚Äì198, 198‚Äì201, 201‚Äì206; v. 16, pp. 618‚Äì630, 651‚Äì655, 680‚Äì681. =Atlantic blockade= All parties recognized from the start that the blockading ships would have to be powered by steam. The limited endurance of steamships then implied that one of the first requirements would be possession of a harbor that would serve as a coaling station near the southern end of the blockading line, as otherwise blockaders would spend too much of their time going to and from home port seeking replenishment. All suitable harbors south of the Chesapeake Bay, however, were held by seceded states. In order to establish the blockade, therefore, at least one of them would have to be taken by the Federal forces. Thus, the blockade was immediately transformed from a purely open-water operation to one of at least limited occupation of enemy territory. Although the board recommended that Fernandina, Florida, be taken as the southern anchor of the blockade, two other positions were captured before Fernandina. A pair of minor forts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina near Cape Hatteras were taken by Union forces on August 28‚Äì29, 1861,Browning, Robert M. Jr, From Cape Charles to Cape Fear pp. 12‚Äì15.; ORN I, V. 6, pp. 119‚Äì145; ORA I, v. 4, pp. 579‚Äì594. and on November 7 a major fleet operation at Port Royal, South Carolina, resulted in the capture of a deep-water harbor midway between Savannah and Charleston.Browning, Robert M. Jr., Success is all that was expected, pp. 23‚Äì42. Interested readers may wish to compare Browning's (correct) account of the bombardment of the forts at Port Royal with the Official Records (ORN I, v. 12, pp. 261‚Äì265). Flag Officer S. F. Du Pont misrepresented the motions of his ships. Unfortunately, many historians continue to follow Du Pont's report. The Hatteras expedition had been planned as a raid; the plan called for it to be held only long enough to block up Hatteras Inlet. However, it was transformed into an incursion, and led early in the next year to a full invasion (the so-called Burnside Expedition, which included the capture of Roanoke Island) that established the Army permanently in eastern North Carolina. Port Royal in Union hands was soon used a base to make the blockade of Savannah almost complete, but Charleston was not so easily sealed off. Use of its harbor by blockade runners was curtailed, but to close it completely required some of the bitterest and most persistent ground action of the war.Wise, Stephen R., Lifeline of the Confederacy, pp. 122‚Äì124. When Fernandina was seized in early March 1862, the war was almost a year old, and some important changes had taken place. Following the Confederate defeats at Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee and Roanoke Island in North Carolina, the War Department in Richmond decided to concentrate its armies in vital interior areas, removing them from much of the coast. Only a few major ports would be defended.ORA I, v. 6, p. 398. Only three of these were on the Atlantic seaboard: Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah. In fact, only the first two were consequential; a mere eight steam-powered blockade runners entered Georgia or northern Florida ports throughout the entire war.Wise, Stephen R., Lifeline of the Confederacy, p. 260 (Appendix 9). The blockade of Charleston merged into the campaign against the city waged by both the Army and the Navy, not completed until the last days of the war. Rather early in the war, the Federal Navy tried to block the harbor entrance by sinking ballast-laden hulks in the channels, but this proved ineffective or worse.Simson, Jay W., Naval strategies of the Civil War., p. 70. ORN I, v. 12, pp. 416‚Äì424, 510‚Äì515. Later, ships used in the blockade were used for the abortive assault on Fort Sumter on April 7, 1863.Browning, Robert M. Jr., Success is all that was expected, pp. 172‚Äì180. They also provided artillery support for the infantry attacks on Battery Wagner on July 11 and July 18, 1863. After both of these attempts to take the battery failed, the ships remained active in the ensuing siege that eventually resulted in its capture.Browning, Robert M. Jr., Success is all that was expected, pp. 220‚Äì234. Then, the Union was able to mount its own guns at the mouth of the harbor, and although the city continued to resist, it was no longer the preferred terminus for blockade runners. While all this was going on, the local defenders were not passive. Extensive efforts to break the blockade included the use of torpedoes (mines) and armored ships to sink or otherwise render inoperative the Federal vessels. Imaginative methods to achieve the same end resulted in the development and deployment of submarines and torpedo boats.Tucker, Spencer C., Blue and gray navies. pp. 259‚Äì267. By contrast, the blockade of Wilmington was fairly conventional, and is the focus of most debate concerning the efficacy of the blockade. After the middle of July 1863, when Charleston was largely sealed off, most of the trade between the Confederacy and northern Europe was conducted through Wilmington. The port retained its primacy until near the end of the Rebellion, when Fort Fisher, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River, was captured by Union forces in January 1865.Browning, Robert M. Jr., From Cape Charles to Cape Fear, pp. 218‚Äì248. =Gulf blockade= The blockade of Confederate ports on the Gulf of Mexico was less important than that on the Atlantic. Not only were they farther from the centers of blockade-running activity in Bermuda and Nassau,Most of the trade of ports on the Gulf was with Havana; see Wise, Lifeline of the Confederacy, pp. 262‚Äì275. but ships trying to reach them from the Atlantic Ocean would have to run past the Florida Keys, which remained in Federal control throughout the war and served as the base for the Gulf (later, East Gulf) Blockading Squadron. The same decision by the Confederate War Department that led to the abandonment of most of the Atlantic coast except for the major ports applied to the Gulf as well, with the result that only Mobile, New Orleans, and Galveston were defended. (Brownsville, Texas/Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, at the mouth of the Rio Grande, is a special case that will not be treated here because of its international implications.Anderson, Bern, By sea and by river, pp. 228‚Äì230.) Galveston was captured by Federal forces on October 4, 1862, but was retaken by the Rebels on New Year's Day of the next year. It remained accessible to blockade runners for the rest of the war but, like all of the Trans-Mississippi, was rendered worthless to the Rebellion when the loss of Vicksburg completed Federal control of the Mississippi River.Tucker, Spencer C., Blue and gray navies. pp. 323‚Äì327. The Blockade Strategy Board had recommended that Ship Island, which lies in the Gulf between Mobile and New Orleans, be taken and used as a base for the (West) Gulf Blockading Squadron. This was easily done, as on September 16, 1861, it was abandoned by its Rebel defenders, who feared that they might be cut off from the mainland. Their fears were justified; the next day, arrived and offloaded Federal troops to take possession.Tucker, Spencer C., Blue and gray navies, p. 186. Almost immediately, however, the island was transformed from base and coaling station to a more important function; it became the staging area for the approaching attack on the Mississippi River forts that shielded New Orleans. After New Orleans fell to the Union fleet under Farragut on April 29, 1862, Mobile was the only serious problem for the blockade. It remained so, much like Wilmington, until late in the war. In August 1864, Farragut got permission from the Navy Department and troops from the War Department to seize the forts at the entrance to Mobile Bay. Following his famous \\"Damn the torpedoes\\" run past the forts, they fell and were occupied by Federal soldiers. Mobile itself remained in Confederate control, but it was no longer useful as a port.Tucker, Spencer C., Blue and gray navies,pp. 329‚Äì426; ORN I, v. 21, pp. 397‚Äì601.  Evaluation  Although a century and a half has elapsed since the end of the Civil War, the importance of the Anaconda Plan remains to some extent a matter of debate. Clearly, the war was not the relatively bloodless affair that General Scott promised in his original proposal. Most historians regard this as merely a modification of the basic strategy in the course of events. At least one historian, however, denies that there ever was anything like a coherent strategy for subduing the South. Rowena ReedReed, Rowena, Combined operations in the Civil War. contends that the central government in Washington was unable to impose its will on the field commanders, so that the war was a series of independent campaigns, each of which was conducted according to the whims of whatever general happened to be in charge. According to her view, the Anaconda is a later conceptual imposition on events for which order did not exist at the time that they took place. For the historians who contend that a rational plan existed, the debate, like the plan itself, has two parts. The importance of the campaign to capture the Mississippi River and thereby lop off the Trans-Mississippi is acknowledged. Virtually all present-day historians agree that the Union's Western campaign was at least as significant as that in the East. To the extent that fighting in the West before mid-1863 can be regarded as preparing for or culminating in the capture of Vicksburg, the Anaconda has been validated. The worth of the Union blockade, however, remains controversial. No one seriously contends that it alone would have won the war for the North. But while it is conceded not to have been sufficient, the question remains if it was necessary, i.e. whether the South would have endured had the blockade not sapped the strength of the Rebel armies beyond the tipping point. Those who deny the importance of the blockade advance two principal arguments. First, it was never very effective. Over the course of the war, more than three quarters of all attempts to evade the blockade were successful. The one quarter that did not get through can be written off as operational losses. That was because the blockade runners were small and built for speed, rather than capacity. Second and perhaps more important, the Southern armies were not hamstrung for lack of material, at least owing to the blockade. The supply problems they did face were most often caused by the poor condition of the Confederate railroads.The blockade was successfully evaded more than 1000 times, compared with about 1300 attempts: Wise, Stephen R., Lifeline of the Confederacy, p. 221. The lack of railroad iron may have been one result of the blockade. Those who believe that the blockade was decisive argue that the Southern forces were strangled at the end. They point out that the collapse of the Army of Northern Virginia, which in 1865 was virtually all that remained of the Confederacy, followed soon after the loss of Wilmington to the Union. The timing, they contend, was not merely coincidental. Furthermore, the defeat of its armies was not the only way that the South lost. The blockade was not only to capture the ships that attempted to evade it but also to discourage others. The blockade runners may have been numerous, but they were built for speed rather than the ability to carry cargo. The more conventional cargo vessels, and their spacious holds, went elsewhere. Unable to sell goods (particularly cotton) on the world market, the Confederate government was already strained financially as early as 1862. As its economy steadily degenerated, it suffered from a general loss of confidence on the part of its citizens.Anderson, Bern, By sea and by river, pp. 230‚Äì231.

appeared in the January 1922 edition of the Japanese literature monthly Shinch≈ç. Akira Kurosawa used this story as the basis for the plot of his award-winning 1950 movie Rash≈çmon. \\"In a Grove\\" is an early modernist short story, as well as a blending of the modernist search for identity with themes from historic Japanese literature, and as such is perhaps the iconic work of Akutagawa's career. It presents three varying accounts of the murder of a samurai, Kanazawa no Takehiro, whose corpse has been found in a bamboo forest near Kyoto. Each section simultaneously clarifies and obfuscates what the reader knows about the murder, eventually creating a complex and contradictory vision of events that brings into question humanity's ability or willingness to perceive and transmit objective truth.  Plot summary  The story opens with the account of a woodcutter who has found a man's body in the woods. The woodcutter reports that man died of a single sword stroke to the chest, and that the trampled leaves around the body showed there had been a violent struggle, but otherwise lacked any significant evidence as to what actually happened. There were no weapons nearby, and no horses‚Äîonly a single piece of rope, a comb and a lot of blood. The next account is delivered by a traveling Buddhist priest. He says that he met the man, who was accompanied by a woman on horseback, on the road, around noon the day before the murder. The man was carrying a sword, a bow and a black quiver. All of these, along with the woman's horse, a tall, short-maned palomino, were missing when the woodcutter discovered the body. The next person to testify is a h≈çmen (ÊîæÂÖç, a released prisoner working under contract to the police, similar to a bounty hunter). He has captured an infamous criminal named Taj≈çmaru. Taj≈çmaru was injured when thrown from a horse (a tall, short-maned palomino), and he was carrying a bow and a black quiver, which did not belong in his usual arsenal. This proves, he says, that Taj≈çmaru was the perpetrator. Taj≈çmaru was not carrying the dead man's sword, however. The next testimony is from an old woman, who identifies herself as the mother of the missing girl. Her daughter is a beautiful, strong-willed 19-year-old named Masago, married to Kanazawa no Takehiro‚Äîa 26-year-old samurai from Wakasa. Her daughter, she says, has never been with a man other than Takehiro. She begs the police to find her daughter. Next, Taj≈çmaru confesses. He says that he met them on the road in the forest, and upon first seeing Masago, decided that he was going to rape her. In order to rape Masago unhindered, he separated the couple, luring Takehiro into the woods with the promise of buried treasure. He then stuffed his mouth full of leaves, tied him to a tree and fetched Masago. When Masago saw her husband tied to the tree, she pulled a dagger from her bosom and tried to stab Taj≈çmaru, but he knocked the knife out of her hand, and he had his way with her. Originally, he had no intention of killing the man, he claims, but after the rape, she begged him to either kill her husband or kill himself‚Äîshe could not live if two men knew her shame. She would leave with the last man standing. Taj≈çmaru did not wish to kill Takehiro in a cowardly manner, so he untied him and they had a sword fight. During the duel, Masago fled. Taj≈çmaru dispatched the man and took the man's sword, bow, and quiver, as well as the woman's horse. He says that he sold the sword before he was captured by the bounty hunter. The second-to-last account is that of Masago. According to her, after the rape, Taj≈çmaru fled, and her husband, still tied to the tree, looked at her with great disdain. She was ashamed that she had been raped, and no longer wished to live, but she wanted him to die with her. He agreed, or so she believed‚Äîhe couldn't actually say anything because his mouth was still stuffed full of leaves‚Äîand she plunged her dagger into his chest. She then cut the rope that bound Takehiro, and ran into the forest, whereupon she attempted to commit suicide numerous times, she said, but her spirit was too strong to die. At the end of her confession, she weeps. The final account comes from Takehiro's ghost, as delivered through a spirit medium. The ghost says that after the rape, Taj≈çmaru persuaded Masago to leave her husband and become his own wife, which she agreed to do under one condition: He would have to kill Takehiro. Taj≈çmaru became enraged at the suggestion, kicked her to the ground, and asked Takehiro if he should kill the dishonorable woman. Hearing this, Masago fled into the forest. Taj≈çmaru then cut Takehiro's bonds and ran away. Takehiro grabbed Masago's fallen dagger and plunged it into his chest. Shortly before he died, he sensed someone creep up to him and steal the dagger from his chest. Throughout, it is obvious that he is furious at his wife.  Analysis  All analyses proceed from these premises: * Takehiro is dead, killed by a stab wound in the chest. * Taj≈çmaru raped Masago. * Taj≈çmaru stole Takehiro's bow and quiver, as well as the woman's horse. * In each of the accounts, Masago wishes Takehiro dead, although the details vary. * Masago and Taj≈çmaru did not leave together. The differences between the characters' stories range from the trivial to the fundamental. What follows is a list of discrepancies between the characters' testimonies. * The comb mentioned by the woodcutter is not mentioned by any of the other characters. * The \\"violent struggle\\" that trampled the leaves, mentioned by the woodcutter, seems to occur only in Taj≈çmaru's version of the story‚Äîthe sword fight. * The woodcutter claims that Takehiro was wearing a Ky≈çto-style hat called a \\"sabi-eboshi\\", however Masago's mother says that he was not from Ky≈çto. We know that the author wanted to draw significance to this fact, because he specifically had the police investigator ask her if Takehiro was from Ky≈çto. * The traveling priest says that he \\"clearly remember[s] that there were more than 20 arrows\\" in the man's quiver. The bounty hunter says that there were only 17. * Taj≈çmaru does not mention how Masago's dagger disappeared from the crime scene. * In Taj≈çmaru's and Takehiro's accounts, Masago and Taj≈çmaru have a long conversation after the rape, after which, she is willing to leave with Taj≈çmaru, so long as her husband is dead. Masago's account omits this completely. * Masago says that Takehiro was repulsed by her after the rape. This is not true according to the other accounts. From Takehiro's story, it is clear that he is furious at her, but he claims that this is because she asked Taj≈çmaru to kill him. In Taj≈çmaru's version, he still loves her so much that he is willing to fight to the death for her. * Takehiro introduces a new and unlikely character: the person who stole the dagger from his chest, conveniently, mere seconds before his death. (The film Rashomon explains this by having the Woodcutter later admit to stealing the dagger, but this confession is not present in the original story. This actually isn't what the woodcutter's testimony shows, because he mentioned that all the blood had dried up and Takehiro claims that as the small sword was retrieved from his chest, \\"more blood flowed into my mouth\\".) * Masago and Takehiro claim that Taj≈çmaru violently kicked her after the rape. Taj≈çmaru says that his desire to make Masago his wife forced him to battle Takehiro instead of kicking the woman off and running away. In short, every character says at least one thing that is refuted by another.

The seventh episode of R.O.D the TV, titled \\"In a Grove\\", deals with a similarly confusing mix of truth and lies, reality and pretense. The name of the story has become an idiom in Japan, used to signify a situation where no conclusion can be drawn, because evidence is insufficient or contradictory. Similar terms include and .  Translation notes  Contrary to what some foreign-language versions of the story may imply, Masago does not confess to the police. This is clear in the Japanese version of the text. The title of this section is:„ÄåÊ∏ÖÊ∞¥ÂØ∫„Å´Êù•„Çå„ÇãÂ•≥„ÅÆÊá∫ÊÇî„Äç(kiyomizu-dera ni kitareru onna no zange, translated in Giles as \\"The Confession of the Woman Visitor to Kiyomizudera Temple\\") The word Êá∫ÊÇî (zange) is often translated as \\"confession\\", but the word also has heavy religious connotations, similar to \\"repentance\\" or \\"penitence\\". Although it can mean \\"to confess to other people\\", it almost always means \\"to confess to Buddha/God\\". Contrast this with Taj≈çmaru's confession to the police, referred to as ÁôΩÁä∂ (hakuj≈ç) in the text. Jay Rubin translated the title of the section to \\"Penitent Confession of a Woman in the Kiyomizu Temple\\". Rubin translated the title of the whole story to In a Bamboo Grove.

Ripoll (born 6 January 1966) is a former Australian politician. He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1998 to 2016, representing the Division of Oxley, Queensland. In 2013, Ripoll was made Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Shadow Minister for Sport, on 15 September 2015 he resigned from the Shadow Cabinet position. Early life Ripoll was born in P√©zenas, H√©rault, France, and educated at the Queensland University of Technology. He was an aircraft electrician with the Royal Australian Air Force, an electrician and an organiser with the State Public Services Federation of Queensland (now known as the Queensland Public Sector Union) before entering politics. Political career At the 1998 federal election, Ripoll sought to regain Oxley for Labor. The seat had been held by Pauline Hanson, who formed One Nation after winning the normally safe Labor seat of Oxley in 1996 as an independent. Prior to the election, Oxley was divided in half, with most of the old Oxley's more rural territory shifted to the new Division of Blair. Hanson opted to contest Blair, which contained most of her former base. Former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss had already been preselected as Labor candidate, but a brain tumour forced him to retire from politics, and Ripoll was named in his place. Ripoll was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure in October 2004. On 2 March 2012, Ripoll was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business from 25 March 2013. In April 2015 Ripoll announced that he would not contest the next election, clearing the way for Milton Dick to pursue Labor party preselection. Dick was elected at the 2016 federal election.

Instead of being a mixture of two or more metals, like alloys, bimetallic objects consist of layers of different metals. Trimetal and tetrametal refer to objects composed of three and four separate metals respectively. A bimetal bar is usually made of brass and iron. Shows the principle of non-heated (left) and heated (right) bimetal Bimetallic strips and disks, which convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement, are the most recognized bimetallic objects due to their name. However, there are other common bimetallic objects. For example, tin cans consist of steel covered with tin. The tin prevents the can from rusting. To cut costs and prevent people from melting them down for their metal, coins are often composed of a cheap metal covered with a more expensive metal. For example, the United States penny was changed from 95% copper to 95% zinc, with a thin copper plating to retain its appearance. A common type of trimetallic object (before the all-aluminium can) was a tin-plated steel can with an aluminum lid with a pull tab. Making the lid out of aluminum allowed it to be pulled off by hand instead of using a can opener, but these cans proved difficult to recycle owing to their mix of metals. Blades for bandsaws and reciprocating saws are often made with bimetal construction. The teeth, made of high speed steel, are bonded (by various methods, for example, electron beam welding or laser beam welding) to the high-strength carbon steel base. Such construction makes for blades with a better combination of cutting speed and durability than shown by non-bimetal blades, because the advantages and disadvantages of each of the metals are applied in the best locations: the teeth are harder (and thus cut better), but therefore also brittler; meanwhile, the body area of the band is softer (which would make for poorer teeth), but also less brittle, and thus more resistant to cracking and breaking (which is desirable in the body area).

The party's name was a contraction of ‚Äòbest union‚Äô. The party was founded in March 1980 by Dick Collver, a former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, who resigned from the PC caucus when he announced the formation of his new party. A few days later, another PC member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLA), Dennis Ham, also left the PC caucus to join Collver. (Ham was the brother of Lynda Haverstock, who later became the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party and later Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.) The Unionest Party was formed at a time when several western separatist parties (such as the Western Canada Concept) were being formed and attracting considerable attention and support because of dissatisfaction with the federal Liberal government.

The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds. Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp, or dummy stamp. Background The first essay depicted Queen Victoria, but Edwin Hill cautioned Reynolds not to make any essays with the Queen's portrait. Therefore, Prince Albert's portrait was used instead. It is noted that the essays have the check letters \\"F\\" and \\"J\\" and it is believed by some scholars that they are the initials of Ferdinand Joubert, who designed Britain's first surface printed postage stamp, the 1855 Four Pence stamp printed by De La Rue, and who may have played a role in the creation of the Prince Consort Essay. Production The Prince Consort Essay was printed from electros taken from one master plate of 12. The twelve positions all have unique characteristics. The essays were printed in red, red-brown, black and blue, in sheets of 36 (3 horizontal rows of 12), in sheets of 240 and in sheets of 252 (21 panes of 12). The essays are scarce and there are approximately 25 recorded examples perforated 16 by Archer. The majority are imperforate, and there is one rouletted example in the Royal Philatelic Collection. Collecting Imperforate copies are available to collectors, typically for around several hundred pounds. There are approximately 36 perforated examples recorded and these sell for much higher prices.

Sam Rosenthal runs Projekt as an independent record label, privately owned and managed by Rosenthal. After many years of struggling with self-distribution, in 1997, Projekt secured exclusive distribution in The US with Ryko Distribution. Distribution was handled through Ryko and ADA (Alternative Distribution Alliance) throughout most of the 2000s and, as of 2012, is handled by E1 Entertainment Distribution. Digital Distribution is through E1 Entertainment Distribution. The label has had many employees over the years who assisted Sam with his vision. Shea Hovey is the current assistant who handles the press contacts as well as the mail- order; she has been with the label since 2000.

Editorials on the Projekt Web site (dating back to January 2001) countered the assumption that all labels oppose all unofficial MP3 downloads.

He was educated in England at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He worked at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and went on several solar eclipse expeditions. He was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1929 to 1931. In 1910, Crommelin and Philip Herbert Cowell jointly received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France, the French astronomical society. AC de la Cherois Crommelin had four children, of whom two were killed in a climbing accident on Pillar Rock, Ennerdale, in 1933. The de la Cherois line was succeeded through Crommelin's daughter Andrina de la Cherois Crommelin (m. Ritter). Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin. An expert on comets, his calculation of orbits of what were then called Comet Forbes 1928 III, Comet Coggia-Winnecke 1873 VII, and Comet Pons 1818 II, in 1929, showed that these comets were one and the same periodic comet. The comet thus received the rather unwieldy name \\"Comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes\\". In 1948, he was posthumously honored when the comet was renamed after him alone (today, in modern nomenclature, it is designated 27P/Crommelin). This is similar to the case of Comet Encke, where the periodic comet is named after the person determining the orbit rather than the possibly-multiple discoverers and re- discoverers at each apparition. Crommelin took part over his career in numerous expeditions throughout the world to study solar eclipses. In 1919 he participated in the solar eclipse expedition to the city of Sobral, in Brazil, which aimed to determine the amount of the deflection of light caused by the gravitational field of the Sun. The results from these observations were crucial in providing confirmation of the General Theory of Relativity, which Albert Einstein had proposed in 1916. Andrew de la Cherois also wrote a book on astronomy entitled \\"The Story of the Stars\\".

It is studied on individual, group, firm, and national levels. Antecedents are prior-based knowledge (knowledge stocks and knowledge flows) and communication. Studies involve a firm's innovation performance, aspiration level, and organizational learning. It has been said that in order to be innovative an organization should develop its absorptive capacity. Cohen and Levinthal's model The concept of absorptive capacity was first defined as a firm's \\"ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends\\" by Cohen and Levinthal.Cohen and Levinthal (1990), \\"Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation\\", Administrative Science Quarterly, Volume 35, Issue 1 pg. 128-152.Cohen and Levinthal (1989), \\"Innovation and learning: The two faces of R&D;\\", The Economic Journal, Volume 99, September pg. 569-596. For them, absorptive capacity depends greatly on prior related knowledge and diversity of background. The investments a firm makes into its research and development (R&D;) efforts are therefore central to their model of development of absorptive capacity. The absorptive capacity is seen as cumulative, meaning that it is easier for a firm to invest on a constant basis in its absorptive capacity than investing punctually. Efforts put to develop absorptive capacity in one period will make it easier to accumulate it in the next one. ‚ÄúThe cumulativeness of absorptive capacity and its effect on expectation formation suggest an extreme case of path dependence in which once a firm ceases investing in its absorptive capacity in a quickly moving field, it may never assimilate and exploit new information in that field, regardless of the value of that information.‚Äù Absorptive capacity is also said to be a reason for companies to invest in R&D; instead of simply purchasing the results post factum (e.g. patents). Internal R&D; teams increase the absorptive capacity of a company. A firm‚Äôs investment in R&D; then impacts directly its absorptive capacity. The more a firm invests in research and development activities, the more it will be able to fully appreciate the value of new external information. Cohen and Levinthal also stressed that diversity allows an individual to make ‚Äúnovel associations and linkages‚Äù. They therefore encourage the hiring of diverse teams in order to have a variety of individuals working together and exposing themselves to different ways of looking at things.  Zahra and George's model  Cohen and Levinthal have focused a lot on investments in R&D; to develop one‚Äôs absorptive capacity, but many other researchers showed later on that several other areas could be explored to develop an organization‚Äôs absorptive capacity. This led to a review of the concept by Shaker Zahra and Gerry GeorgeZahra and George (2002), \\"Absorptive Capacity: A Review,Reconceptualization,and Extension\\", Academy of Management Review,Volume 27, Issue 2,pg.185-203 and a reformulation of the definition that expanded greatly the concept and further defined it as being made of two different absorptive capacities: potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity. Their new definition of absorptive capacity is: ‚Äúa set of organizational routines and processes by which firms acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge to produce a dynamic organizational capability.‚Äù =Potential Absorptive Capacity= Zahra and George presented the potential absorptive capacity is made of two elements. First there is knowledge acquisition which ‚Äúrefers to a firm‚Äôs capability to identify and acquire externally generated knowledge that is critical to its operations.‚Äù Second, there is assimilation capability which ‚Äúrefers to the firm‚Äôs routines and processes that allow it to analyze, process, interpret and understand the information obtained from external sources.‚Äù ‚ÄúPotential absorptive capacity makes the firm receptive to acquiring and assimilating external knowledge.‚Äù =Realized Absorptive Capacity= Realized absorptive capacity is made up of transformation capability on one hand that can be defined as ‚Äúa firm‚Äôs capability to develop and refine the routines that facilitate combining existing knowledge and the newly acquired and assimilated knowledge.‚Äù On the other hand, realized absorptive capacity is also made of the exploitation capability of a firm which is basically the capacity of a firm to apply the newly acquired knowledge in product or services that it can get financial benefit from. ‚ÄúRealized absorptive capacity is a function of the transformation and exploitation capabilities.‚Äù Zahra and George go on to suggest a series of indicators that can be used to evaluate each element of absorptive capacity. * Knowledge acquisition capability (the number of years of experience of the R&D; department, the amount of R&D; investment) * Assimilation capability (the number of cross-firm patent citations, the number of citations made in a firm‚Äôs publications to research developed in other firms) * Transformation capability (the number of new product ideas, the number of new research projects initiated) * Exploitation capability (the number of patent, the number of new product announcements, the length of product development cycle) George and his colleagues (Zou, Ertug, George, 2018)Zou, T., Ertug, G., & George, G. (2018). The capacity to innovate: a meta-analysis of absorptive capacity. Innovation, 1-35. conduct a meta- analysis of absorptive capacity and they find that: (1)Absorptive capacity is a strong predictor of innovation and knowledge transfer, and its effects on financial performance are fully mediated by innovation and knowledge transfer; (2) The firm size-absorptive capacity relationship is positive for small firms but negative for larger firms. The firm age-absorptive capacity relationship is negative for mature firms and not significant for young firms; (3) Social integration mechanisms, knowledge infrastructure, management support, and relational capability all have a positive and significant impact on the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship (whereas they do not find the breadth of external search or competitive intensity to impact that relationship). Environmental dynamism has a marginally significant negative impact on the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship; and (4) They also find that the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship is stronger when absorptive capacity is measured by surveys rather than when absorptive capacity is measured by archival proxies. =A refined model of Absorptive Capacity= A more recent contribution proposed to (a) reintroduce the original first component in Cohen and Levinthal's model. The contribution noted (b) that transformation is not a step after assimilation, but represents an alternative process. Consequently, it suggested that (c) the neat distinction between potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity does not hold any more. ad (a): Firms often fail to identify and absorb new external knowledge; recognizing the value of new external knowledge is often biased and needs to be fostered; it is not automatic. Managers have often problems in assessing the value of new external knowledge when it is not relevant for the current demands of key customers. ad (b): Both assimilation and transformation involve some degree of change of the new knowledge and its combination with the existing knowledge. When the new knowledge fits existing cognitive schemas well, it is assimilated. When the new knowledge cannot be assimilated, the cognitive structures must be transformed. Firms transform their knowledge structures when knowledge cannot be assimilated. Transformation does not follow assimilation, it is an alternative to it. ad (c): As transformation is an alternative to assimilation and not sequential to assimilation, it becomes part of potential absorptive capacity in Zahra and George's model; consequently, realized absorptive capacity simply relabels the component of exploitation. Further, without the effect of realized capacity, potential capacity cannot have any effect on a firm's competitive advantage; potential absorptive capacity cannot be meaningful separated from realized absorptive capacity in empirical studies on value creation. Accordingly, firms with high levels of absorptive capacity (1) recognize the value of new external knowledge, (2) acquire, (3) assimilate or transform, and (4) exploit new external knowledge. However, Zahra and George argue that the concept has a too broad definition as well as no clear dimensions or scales, evidenced by the variations among different studies that have used the absorptive capacity theory. Bosch et al. contend that absorptive capacity should not be based only on prior related knowledge, as Cohen and Levinthal originally proposed, but rather, organizational culture and combinative capabilities should be considered as antecedents to a firm‚Äôs absorptive capacity. For example, a business culture that appreciates and supports continued learning has a higher absorptive capacity than other business cultures that do not support individual learning and development. To further clarify concepts related to the absorptive capacity theory, Wheeler introduced an application derived from the dynamic capability and absorptive capacity theories for business innovations. Wheeler‚Äôs Net-Enabled Business Innovation Cycle facilitates understanding and predicting how firms transform its prior orientation and internal resources associated with net-enablement into business innovation and economical growth.

Today the theory involves organizational learning, industrial economics, the resource-based view of the firm and dynamic capabilities. This theory has undergone major refinement, and today a firm's absorptive capacity is mostly conceptualized as a dynamic capability. As a complement to absorptive capacity in outward knowledge transfer, the notion of desorptive capacity was developed. Desorptive capacity may play a key role for managing innovation in networks. It is particularly important for networks and collaborations with mutual, bidirectional knowledge transfer. Two concepts related to absorptive capacity are: * Receptivity: The firm's overall ability to be aware of, identify and take effective advantage of technology.Seaton R.A.F. & Cordey-Hayes M., The Development and Application of Interactive Models of Industrial Technology Transfer, Technovation, 13: 45-53, 1993. * Innovative Routines: Practiced routines that define a set of competencies the firm is capable of doing confidently and the focus of the firm's innovation efforts.Nelson & Winter (1982), \\"The Schumpeterian Tradeoff Revisited\\", The American Economic Review, Volume 72, Issue 1,pg.114-132 In regions in the Global South, regional innovation agencies can work as knowledge gatekeepers to stimulate new technological trajectories by facilitating the acquisition, diffusion and engaging in the ‚Äòtropicalization‚Äô of extra-regional knowledge to facilitate its absorption within the regional innovation system.

Founding The party was founded by Paul MacEwan, who had been an NDP member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for ten years, 1970 to 1980. MacEwan was kicked out of the NDP in 1980, after allegedly calling party executive Dennis Theman a Trotskyite. MacEwan ran as an independent, in the 1981 election and was re-elected by a strong margin. He took this as a mandate to set up a rival party. The Cape Breton Labour Party was founded at a convention held in Glace Bay in the fall of 1982. MacEwan was elected its provincial leader. While at first the intent was to run candidates only on Cape Breton Island, the provisions of the Nova Scotia Elections Act forced the party to run candidates also in several mainland ridings to obtain recognition as a registered political party. The party's name was also changed to the Labour Party of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia at this time. In the end, a total of fourteen Labour candidates were run, eleven on Cape Breton and three on the mainland. In the 1984 election, the 14 Labour candidates obtained a total of 8,322 votes. MacEwan was re- elected, with 3,832 votes. He thus became the first, and so far the only, candidate sponsored by a fourth political party to gain a seat in the Nova Scotia Legislature. Other Labour candidates were not elected, but managed to retain their deposits in the constituencies of Cape Breton East and Cape Breton Centre, while the NDP vote in those areas plunged to an all-time low in the same seats the party had held under Akerman. After the 1984 election, MacEwan felt that the Labour Party could not continue, as insufficient funds had been raised to meet its minimum financial requirements. He ran in the next provincial election, held in 1988, as an independent and joined the Liberal Party in 1990. Issues The main issues in contention between the Labour Party and the NDP centered on how the party was to be run and in what direction. MacEwan maintained that freedom of speech was important in politics and that elected representatives should be free to represent their constituents as they best determined. The Halifax NDP, led by Alexa McDonough throughout this period, emphasized established party policy and expected MLAs to subscribe to this first before formulating their opinions on issues. Much of the tussle was over geography and whether Cape Breton, or downtown Halifax, should be in control of operations. The Halifax NDP claimed that the Labour Party was \\"separatist\\" but never identified how. There is no mention found advocating any constitutional change for Cape Breton Island in the advertising run by the Labour Party in the 1984 election. The party issued a multi-point election platform, but its contents were confined to such traditional Cape Breton issues as \\"proper\\" levels of government support for the coal and steel industries, a higher minimum wage, reform of workers compensation, and improvements to highways. The dispute was accentuated by bad personal relations between MacEwan and the new NDP provincial leader, Alexa McDonough, each viewing the other as unworthy. MacEwan considered that McDonough had encouraged his expulsion from the NDP for political advantage and had gained the NDP leadership by intrigue. Each was inclined to criticize the other publicly, McDonough depicting MacEwan as an unrepentant enemy of all the NDP stood for, while MacEwan described McDonough and her father, industrialist Lloyd Shaw, as seeking to use their wealth to try to prevent democracy in Nova Scotia politics.

Background In the duodenum, dietary fat (primarily triglycerides) is digested by enzymes such as pancreatic lipase into smaller molecules of 1,2-Diacylglycerols and free fatty acids, which can be absorbed through the wall of the jejenum of the small intestine and enter circulation for metabolism and storage. Since fat is a valuable nutrient, human feces normally contains very little undigested fat. However, a number of diseases of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract are characterized by fat malabsorption. Examples of such diseases are: * disorders of exocrine pancreatic function, such as chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis and Shwachman‚ÄìDiamond syndrome (these are characterized by deficiency of pancreatic digestive enzymes) * celiac disease (in which the fat malabsorption in severe cases is due to inflammatory damage to the integrity of the intestinal lining) * short bowel syndrome (in which much of the small intestine has had to be surgically removed and the remaining portion cannot completely absorb all of the fat). *small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome Microscopy In the simplest form of the fecal fat test, a random fecal specimen is submitted to the hospital laboratory and examined under a microscope after staining with a Sudan III or Sudan IV dye (\\"Sudan staining\\"). Visible amounts of fat indicate some degree of fat malabsorption. Quantitative Quantitative fecal fat tests measure and report an amount of fat. This is usually done over a period of three days, the patient collecting all of their feces into a container. The container is thoroughly mixed to homogenize the feces, without using specific mixer equipment. A small sample from the feces is collected. The fat content is extracted with solvents and measured by saponification (turning the fat into soap). Normally, up to 7 grams of fat can be malabsorbed in people consuming 100 grams of fat per day. In patients with diarrhea, up to 12 grams of fat may be malabsorbed since the presence of diarrhea interferes with fat absorption, even when the diarrhea is not due to fat malabsorption.

The voltage is theoretically dependent on the logarithm of the ionic activity, according to the Nernst equation. Ion-selective electrodes are used in analytical chemistry and biochemical/biophysical research, where measurements of ionic concentration in an aqueous solution are required. Types of ion-selective membrane There are four main types of ion-selective membrane used in ion- selective electrodes (ISEs): glass, solid state, liquid based, and compound electrode. (Review article) =Glass membranes= Glass membranes are made from an ion-exchange type of glass (silicate or chalcogenide). This type of ISE has good selectivity, but only for several single-charged cations; mainly H+, Na+, and Ag+. Chalcogenide glass also has selectivity for double-charged metal ions, such as Pb2+, and Cd2+. The glass membrane has excellent chemical durability and can work in very aggressive media. A very common example of this type of electrode is the pH glass electrode. =Crystalline membranes= Crystalline membranes are made from mono- or polycrystallites of a single substance. They have good selectivity, because only ions which can introduce themselves into the crystal structure can interfere with the electrode response. This is the major difference between this type of electrodes and the glass membrane electrodes. The lack of internal solution reduces the potential junctions. Selectivity of crystalline membranes can be for both cation and anion of the membrane-forming substance. An example is the fluoride selective electrode based on LaF3 crystals. =Ion-exchange resin membranes= Ion- exchange resins are based on special organic polymer membranes which contain a specific ion-exchange substance (resin). This is the most widespread type of ion-specific electrode. Usage of specific resins allows preparation of selective electrodes for tens of different ions, both single-atom or multi- atom. They are also the most widespread electrodes with anionic selectivity. However, such electrodes have low chemical and physical durability as well as \\"survival time\\". An example is the potassium selective electrode, based on valinomycin as an ion-exchange agent. =Enzyme electrodes= Enzyme electrodes definitely are not true ion-selective electrodes but usually are considered within the ion-specific electrode topic. Such an electrode has a \\"double reaction\\" mechanism - an enzyme reacts with a specific substance, and the product of this reaction (usually H+ or OH‚àí) is detected by a true ion- selective electrode, such as a pH-selective electrodes. All these reactions occur inside a special membrane which covers the true ion-selective electrode, which is why enzyme electrodes sometimes are considered as ion-selective. An example is glucose selective electrodes. Alkali metal ISE Valinomycin Electrodes specific for each alkali metal ion, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ have been developed. The principle on which these electrodes are based is that the alkali metal ion is encapsulated in a molecular cavity whose size is matched to the size of the ion. For example, an electrode based on Valinomycin may be used for the determination of potassium ion concentration.

It is calculated by dividing the haemoglobin by the haematocrit. Reference ranges for blood tests are 32 to 36 g/dL (320 to 360g/L), or between 4.81 and 5.58 mmol/L. It is thus a mass or molar concentration. Still, many instances measure MCHC in percentage (%), as if it were a mass fraction (mHb / mRBC).Blood Test Results - Normal Ranges Bloodbook.Com. Retrieved on Jan 7, 2009MedicineNet > Definition of MCHC Last Editorial Review: 7/21/1999 Numerically, however, the MCHC in g/dL and the mass fraction of haemoglobin in red blood cells in % are identical, assuming an RBC density of 1g/mL and negligible haemoglobin in plasma. Interpretation A low MCHC can be interpreted as identifying decreased production of hemoglobin. MCHC can be normal even when hemoglobin production is decreased (such as in iron deficiency) due to a calculation artifact. MCHC can be elevated (\\"polychromatic\\") in hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and homozygous haemoglobin C disease, depending upon the hemocytometer. MCHC can be elevated in some megaloblastic anemias. MCHC can be falsely elevated when there is agglutination of red cells (falsely lowering the measured RBC) or when there is opacifaction of the plasma (falsely increasing the measured hemoglobin). Causes of plasma opacification that can falsely increase the MCHC include hyperbilirubinemia, hypertryglyceridemia, and free hemoglobin in the plasma (due to hemolysis). Complicating conditions Because of the way automated analysers count blood cells, a very high MCHC (greater than about 370 g/L) may indicate the blood is from someone with a cold agglutinin, or there may be some other problem resulting in one or more artifactual results affecting the MCHC. For example, for some patients with cold agglutinins, when their blood gets colder than 37 ¬∞C, the red cells will clump together. As a result, the analyzer may incorrectly report a low number of very dense red blood cells. This will result in an impossibly high number when the analyzer calculates the MCHC. This problem is usually picked up by the laboratory before the result is reported. The blood can be warmed until the cells separate from each other, and quickly put through the machine while still warm. There are four steps to perform when a suspect increased MCHC (>370 g/L or >37.0 g/dL) is received from the analyzer: # Remix the EDTA tube‚Äîif the MCHC corrects, report corrected results # Incubation at 37 ¬∞C‚Äîif the MCHC corrects, report corrected results and comment on possible cold agglutinin # Saline replacement: Replace plasma with same amount of saline to exclude interference e.g. Lipemia and Auto-immune antibodies‚Äîif the MCHC corrects, report corrected results and comment on Lipemia # Check the slide for spherocytosis (e.g. in hereditary spherocytosis, among other causes) Worked example See also * Red blood cell indices ** Mean corpuscular volume ** Mean corpuscular hemoglobin  References  External links * FP Notebook Blood tests ","title":"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration"},{"id":"593418","text":"Hemoglobin The mean corpuscular hemoglobin , or \\"mean cell hemoglobin\\" (MCH), is the average mass of hemoglobin (Hb) per red blood cell (RBC) in a sample of blood. It is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. MCH value is diminished in hypochromic anemias. It is calculated by dividing the total mass of hemoglobin by the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. MCH=(Hb*10)/RBC A normal MCH value in humans is 27 to 31 picograms/cell. The amount of hemoglobin per RBC depends on hemoglobin synthesis and the size of the RBC. The weight of the red cell is determined by the iron (as part of the hemoglobin molecule), thus MCH in picogram is the weight of one red cell. In iron deficiency anemia the cell weight becomes lighter, thus a MCH < 27pg is an indication of iron deficiency. The MCH decreases when Hb synthesis is reduced, or when RBCs are smaller than normal, such as in cases of iron- deficiency anemia. Conversion to SI-units: 1 pg of hemoglobin = 0.06207 femtomol.

The measure is attained by multiplying a volume of blood by the proportion of blood that is cellular (the hematocrit), and dividing that product by the number of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in that volume. The mean corpuscular volume is a part of a standard complete blood count. In patients with anemia, it is the MCV measurement that allows classification as either a microcytic anemia (MCV below normal range), normocytic anemia (MCV within normal range) or macrocytic anemia (MCV above normal range). Normocytic anemia is usually deemed so because the bone marrow has not yet responded with a change in cell volume. It occurs occasionally in acute conditions, namely blood loss and hemolysis. If the MCV was determined by automated equipment, the result can be compared to RBC morphology on a peripheral blood smear, where a normal RBC is about the size of a normal lymphocyte nucleus. Any deviation would usually be indicative of either faulty equipment or technician error, although there are some conditions that present with high MCV without megaloblastic cells. For further specification, it can be used to calculate red blood cell distribution width (RDW). The RDW is a statistical calculation made by automated analyzers that reflects the variability in size and shape of the RBCs. Calculation To calculate MCV, the hematocrit (Hct) is divided by the concentration of RBCs ([RBC]) \\\\textit{MCV} = \\\\frac{\\\\textit{Hct}\\\\times 10}{[\\\\textit{RBC}]} Normally, MCV is expressed in femtoliters (fL, or 10‚àí15L), and [RBC] is the quantity expressed in millions per microliter (106 / ŒºL). The normal range for MCV is 80‚Äì100 fL. For example, if the Hct = 42.5% and [RBC] = 4.58 million per microliter (4,580,000/ŒºL), then \\\\textit{MCV} = \\\\frac{0.425 \\\\times 10}{4.58 \\\\cdot 10^6/10^{-6} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{L}} = 92.8 \\\\cdot 10^{-15} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{L} = 92.8 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{fL} The MCV can be determined in a number of ways by automatic analyzers. In volume-sensitive automated blood cell counters, such as the Coulter counter, the red cells pass one-by-one through a small aperture and generate a signal directly proportional to their volume. Other automated counters measure red blood cell volume by means of techniques that measure refracted, diffracted, or scattered light. Interpretation The normal reference range is typically 80-100 fL. =High= In pernicious anemia (macrocytic), MCV can range up to 150 femtolitres. An elevated MCV is also associated with alcoholism (as are an elevated GGT and an AST/ALT ratio of 2:1). Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency has also been associated with macrocytic anemia (high MCV numbers). =Low= The most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency (due to inadequate dietary intake, gastrointestinal blood loss, or menstrual blood loss), thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia or chronic disease. In iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia), it can be as low as 60 to 70 femtolitres. In some cases of thalassemia, the MCV may be low even though the patient is not iron deficient. Worked example Derivation The MCV can be conceptualized as the total volume of a group of cells divided by the number of cells. For a real world sized example, imagine you had 10 small jellybeans with a combined volume of 10 ¬µL. The mean volume of a jellybean in this group would be 10 ¬µL / 10 jellybeans = 1 ¬µL / jellybean. A similar calculation works for MCV. 1\\\\. Measure the RBC index in cells/¬µL.

Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6‚Äì8 Œºm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range of RDW-CV in human red blood cells is 11.5‚Äì15.4%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin B12 or folate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two-thirds of all cases. However, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of both iron and B12 deficiencies, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias. Anemia of chronic disease, hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) may all present with a normal RDW.Table 1.4 in: Kjeldsberg, Carl R.; Perkins, Sherrie L..

In 1897, the school became the first co-educational Catholic university in North America to grant degrees to women. Four women were awarded university degrees in 1897. A metal plaque in the St. Francis Xavier University Chapel is dedicated to the thirty-three members of the college, now St. Francis Xavier University, who were killed in service during the First World War (1914‚Äì18). In February 1922, St. Francis Xavier University's War Memorial Rink, with a brick exterior and wooden interior, opened. After the War Memorial Rink was officially closed on February 8, 2002, the building was torn down and a new science complex was built in the old rink's place. StFX‚Äôs extension department has engaged in community development in Antigonish since 1928 while the Coady International Institute at StFX has engaged in community development globally since 1959. A metal plaque, unveiled on 5 May 1984, was dedicated by the university's Class of 1984, in honour of those students killed in armed conflict while defending the liberty of Canadians. In 1985 the number of women students at St. Francis Xavier became equal to the number of men for the first time. In 1990, the women's college existed as a residence only. In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.University, Encyclopedia of Canada The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The St. Francis Xavier tartan was designed as a university tartan in 1994. In 1996 StFX implemented Canada's first Service Learning program, which provided opportunities for international learning. On March 21, 2014, the Board of Governors announced Kent MacDonald as incoming president of StFX, to assume office on August 1, 2014. Academics Angus L.

In game theory In game theory, a kingmaker is a player who lacks sufficient resources or position to win at a given game, but possesses enough remaining resources to decide which of the remaining viable players will eventually win. Contemporary usage The term \\"kingmaker\\", though always unofficial, has tended to gain more importance in places of power struggle‚Äîe.g., politics, sports organizations etc. Consequently, bestowal of such a title is looked upon significantly and more often as a means of indirect gratification for individuals wanting to silently dictate the affairs of the organization. The term is also occasionally used in a pejorative sense during elections where a small number of independent political candidate(s) who hold a sizeable sway in the \\"vote bank\\" can most likely decide the course of an outcome. As well as referring to an individual, the term can also be applied to institutions or think tanks whose opinions are held in great regard by the interested organization. The influence of the religious orders like the Roman Catholic Church in running the affairs of the state during medieval times (through the king) is a well- known example. Kingdoms and empires in the Indian sub-continent often relied on their religious heads. Besides religious orders, even countries can fit into this terminology when they can dictate the affairs of the other country (either directly or indirectly). In current political scenarios across the world the term can expand its scope to include powerful lobbying groups, whose role is often seen as a defining factor on major issues. Citizens of West African sub-national monarchies often use the word kingmaker to refer to the members of the electoral colleges that choose their sovereigns because they also usually officiate during the coronation rituals and rites of purification, the word in this particular case taking on a literal meaning i.e. a maker of the king. The term \\"kingmaker\\" is also used to describe situations in multi-player games where a player is either unable to win or has claimed an unassailable lead, but, in either case, plays a strong role in determining the outcome for other players.

He was a fierce opponent of the apartheid government, and was assassinated by Janusz Walu≈õ, a Polish immigrant and sympathiser of the Conservative opposition on 10 April 1993, during the unrest preceding the transition to democracy. Early life Thembisile Hani was born on 28 June 1942 in the small town of Cofimvaba, Transkei. He was the fifth of six children. He attended Lovedale school in 1957, to finish his last two years. He twice finished two school grades in a single year. When Hani was 12 years old, after hearing his father's explanations about apartheid and the African National Congress, he wished to join the ANC but was still too young to be accepted. In Lovedale school, Hani joined the ANC Youth League when he was 15 years old, even though political activities were not allowed at black schools under apartheid. He influenced other students to join the ANC. In 1959, at the University of Fort Hare in Alice, Eastern Cape, Hani studied English, Latin and modern and classical literature. He did not participate in any sport, saying \\"I would rather fight apartheid than play sport\\". Hani, in an interview on the Wankie campaign, mentioned that he was a Rhodes University graduate. Political and military career At age 15 he joined the ANC Youth League. As a student he was active in protests against the Bantu Education Act. He worked as a clerk for a law firm. Following his graduation, he joined Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. Following his arrest under the Suppression of Communism Act, he went into exile in Lesotho in 1963. Because of Hani's involvement with Umkhonto we Sizwe he was forced into hiding by the South African government during which time he changed his first name to Chris. He received military training in the Soviet Union and served in campaigns in the Zimbabwean War of Liberation, also called the Rhodesian Bush War. They were joint operations between Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army in the late 1960s. The Luthuli Detachment operation consolidated Hani's reputation as a soldier in the black army that took the field against apartheid and its allies. His role as a fighter from the earliest days of MK's exile (following the arrest of Nelson Mandela and the other internal MK leaders at Rivonia) was an important part in the fierce loyalty Hani enjoyed in some quarters later as MK's Deputy Commander (Joe Modise was overall commander). In 1969 he co-signed, with six others, the 'Hani Memorandum' which was strongly critical of the leadership of Joe Modise, Moses Kotane and other comrades in the leadership.The ‚ÄòHani Memorandum‚Äô ‚Äì introduced and annotated by Hugh Macmillan , Transformation, 2009 In Lesotho he organised guerrilla operations of the MK in South Africa. By 1982, Hani had become prominent enough that he was the target of assassination attempts, and he eventually moved to the ANC's headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia. As head of Umkhonto we Sizwe, he was responsible for the suppression of a mutiny by dissident anti-Communist ANC members in detention camps, but denied any role in abuses including torture and murder. Many MK female operatives like Dipuo Mvelase adored Chris Hani for having protected women's rights and caring about their wellbeing at military camps. Having spent time as a clandestine organiser in South Africa in the mid-1970s, he permanently returned to South Africa following the unbanning of the ANC in 1990, and took over from Joe Slovo as head of the South African Communist Party on the 8 December 1991.http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/chris-hani-elected-sacp-secretary He supported the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle in favour of negotiations. Assassination Chris Hani was assassinated on 10 April 1993 outside his home in Dawn Park, a racially mixed suburb of Boksburg. He was accosted by a Polish far-right anti-communist immigrant named Janusz Walu≈õ, who shot him as he stepped out of his car. Walu≈õ fled the scene but was soon arrested after Margareta Harmse, a white Afrikaner housewife, saw Walus straight after the crime as she was driving past, and called the police. A neighbour of Hani also witnessed the crime and later identified both Walus, and the vehicle he was driving at the time. Clive Derby-Lewis, a senior South African Conservative Party MP and Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs at the time, who had lent Walu≈õ his pistol, was also arrested for complicity in Hani's murder. The Conservative Party of South Africa had broken away from the ruling National Party out of opposition to the reforms of P. W. Botha. After the elections of 1989, it was the second-strongest party in the House of Assembly, after the National Party, and opposed F. W. de Klerk's dismantling of apartheid. Historically, the assassination is seen as a turning point. Serious tensions followed the assassination, with fears that the country would erupt in violence. Nelson Mandela addressed the nation appealing for calm, in a speech regarded as presidential even though he was not yet president of the country: While riots followed the assassination, both sides of the negotiation process were galvanised into action, and they soon agreed that the democratic elections should take place on 27 April 1994, just over a year after Hani's assassination. =Assassins' conviction and amnesty hearing= Both Janusz Walu≈õ and Clive Derby-Lewis were sentenced to death for the murder. Derby- Lewis's wife, Gaye, was acquitted. Both men's sentences were commuted to life imprisonment when the death penalty was abolished as a result of a Constitutional Court ruling in 1995.https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-10-08-chris-hani-and-the- arms-deal-bombshell-a-death-that-still-hangs-over-us/ Hani's killers appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, claiming political motivation for their crimes and applying for amnesty on the basis that they had acted on the orders of the Conservative Party. The Hani family was represented by the anti-apartheid lawyer George Bizos. Their applications were denied when the TRC ruled that they had not acted under orders. After several failed attempts, Derby-Lewis was granted medical parole in May 2015 after he had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer; he died 18 months later, on 3 November 2016. On 10 March 2016, the North Gauteng High Court of South Africa ordered Walu≈õ to be released on parole under bail conditions. The Department of Justice and Correctional Services lodged an appeal against the parole decision to the Supreme Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein. The Department of Home Affairs has indicated that Walu≈õ may have his South African citizenship revoked. =Conspiracy theories surrounding assassination= Hani's assassination has attracted numerous conspiracy theories about outside involvement. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, however, said that it \\"was unable to find evidence that the two murderers convicted of the killing of Chris Hani took orders from international groups, security forces or from higher up in the right-wing echelons.\\" Influence Hani was a charismatic leader, with significant support among the radical anti-apartheid youth. At the time of his death, he was the most popular ANC leader after Nelson Mandela, and was sometimes perceived as a rival to the more moderate party leadership. Following the legalisation of the ANC, Hani's support for the negotiation process with the apartheid government was critical in keeping the militants in line. Honours right In 1993, French philosopher Jacques Derrida dedicated Spectres de Marx (1993) to Hani.Jacques Derrida (1994) Spectres de Marx: l'√©tat de la dette, le travail du deil et la nouvelle Internationale, Galil√©e, Paris (). In 1997, Baragwanath Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the world, was renamed the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in his memory.The history of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital , chrishanibaragwanathhospital.co.za (accessed 3 November 2016) In September 2004, Hani was voted 20th in the controversial Top 100 Greatest South Africans poll. Days after his assassination, the rock group Dave Matthews Band (whose lead singer and guitarist, Dave Matthews, is from South Africa) began playing what would become \\"#36\\", with lyrics and chorus referring to Hani's shooting.Martell, Nevin. \\"Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People\\", p. 57.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town in Warrumbungle Shire that sits on the divide between the Central West and North West Slopes regions of New South Wales, Australia. At the 2016 census, the town had a population of 2,537.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . The town's nickname is \\"Coona\\". History and description In 1817 the area was opened up by a Government-sponsored expedition. In 1818 John Oxley found Aboriginal people living here ‚Äî later identified as the western language reach of the Kamilaroi clans (Gamilaraay is the spelling used by linguists). Kamilaroi people are still well represented in the region, having occupied Coonabarabran for approximately 7,500 years. In 1859 Lewis Gordon first proposed a town plan survey for Coonabarabran. Nobody really seems to know the source and meaning of the word Coonabarabran. It may derive from a person's name or from the Kamilaroi language word 'gunbaraaybaa' meaning 'excrement', translated earlier as meaning, 'peculiar odour', this possibly is a bowdlerisation. Another meaning is derived from an Aboriginal word for 'inquisitive person'. 'Coolabarabran' was the name of a station owned by James Weston in 1848.

Climate Coonabarabran has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cfa), with hot summers and cool winters. Owing to its location near the Warrumbungle Mountains, winter minima are much colder than other towns in northwestern New South Wales, and are in fact comparable to Canberra or Orange or Armidale along the Great Divide. On average 56.6 mornings, including 16.3 in July, fall below , and in July 2002 the mean minimum was as low as . Rainfall can occur at any time of year but is most frequent from December to February with summer thunderstorms. Temperature extremes have historically ranged from to .

Approximately 2700 copies are distributed each Thursday across the townships of Coonabarabran, Binnaway, Baradine, Coolah, Dunedoo, Mendooran and Mullaley. The Coonabarabran Times was founded in 1927 as an amalgamation of The Bligh Watchman (1877‚Äì1927) and The Clarion (1910‚Äì1927). It continues to be a solid publication, consisting of local news and issues facing the community, sport, events and advertisements. Coonabarabran was one of the earliest towns to have a dedicated website after registering Coonabarabran.com in 1999 and creating a website in 2001. The site was closed and the domain sat idle after mismanagement of the domain after the closure of the Coonabarabran Technology Centre in 2013. A local individual then created Coonabarabran.org in 2013 which now hosts Coonabarabran News, an online curation of local news and interest stories. Coonabarabran also has a Facebook page and Twitter account under the Coonabarabran name. The area is currently served by a small community radio station, 2WCR FM. This station broadcasts on 99.5 FM.

Enakeno Oju. Daily Times. 20 June 2013. Retrieved 13 January 2014. Lavoe is considered to be possibly the best and most important singer and interpreter in the history of salsa music because he helped to establish the popularity of this musical genre in the decades of 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. His personality, style and the qualities of his voice led him to a successful artistic career in the whole field of Latin music and salsa during the 1970s and 1980s. The cleanness and brightness of his voice, coupled with impeccable diction and the ability to sing long and fast phrases with total naturalness, made him one of the favorite singers of the Latin public. Lavoe was born and raised in the Machuelo Abajo barrio of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Early in his life, he attended Escuela Libre de M√∫sica de Ponce, known today as the Instituto de M√∫sica Juan Morel Campos and, inspired by Jes√∫s S√°nchez Erazo, developed an interest in music.The Triumph and Tragedy of Hector Lavoe from salsacentro.com He moved to New York City on 3 May 1963, at the age of sixteen. Shortly after his arrival, he worked as the singer in a sextet formed by Roberto Garc√≠a. During this period, he performed with several other groups, including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and Johnny Pacheco's band. In 1967, Lavoe joined Willie Col√≥n's band as its vocalist, recording several hit songs, including \\"El Malo\\" and \\"Canto a Borinquen.\\" Lavoe moved on to become a soloist and formed his own band performing as lead vocalist. As a soloist, Lavoe recorded several hits including: \\"El cantante\\" composed by Rub√©n Blades, \\"Bandolera\\" composed by Col√≥n, and \\"Peri√≥dico de ayer\\", composed by Tite Curet Alonso. During this period he was frequently featured as a guest singer with the Fania All Stars recording numerous tracks with the band. In 1979, Lavoe became deeply depressed and sought the help of a high priest of the Santer√≠a faith to treat his drug addiction. After a short rehabilitation, he relapsed following the deaths of his father, son, and mother-in-law. These events, along with being diagnosed with HIV, drove Lavoe to attempt suicide by jumping off a Condado hotel room balcony in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He survived the attempt and recorded an album before his health began failing. Lavoe died on 29 June 1993, from a complication of AIDS. Early life Mi Gente\\" mural of Lavoe in his hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico H√©ctor was born 30 September 1946 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Francisca (Pachita) Mart√≠nez and Luis P√©rez, and raised in the Machuelo Abajo barrio of the city. He was inspired early in life by his musically talented family. His grandfather, Don Juan Mart√≠nez, was a singer of controversial songs, which led to physical confrontations. His uncle was well known in Ponce as a tres player. His mother Francisca, also known as Pachita, was well known by her family and townspeople for her beautiful singing voice. His father, Luis, supported his wife and eight children by singing and playing guitar with trios and big bands. He was in high demand as a guitarist for the Fiestas de Cruz celebrations and other popular religious ceremonies, and he wanted his son to receive formal musical training as a trombonist; H√©ctor dreamt of being a singer. H√©ctor was influenced by Puerto Rican singers such as Jes√∫s S√°nchez Erazo, also known as \\"Chu√≠to el de Bayam√≥n\\" - one of the island's most successful folk singers, and Daniel Santos. Later in his life, he would record songs with both artists. H√©ctor attended the local Juan Morel Campos Public School of Music where the first instrument he learned to play was the saxophone. His classmates included Jos√© Febles and multi-instrumentalist Papo Lucca. One of his teachers was very strict and demanded that he practice good diction and manners, and have a strong stage presence. He felt H√©ctor would become a superstar as a bolero singer. From the start H√©ctor was a star with exceptional charisma, talent, and charm. One of a kind, his unique voice, refined and with impeccable diction, demanded attention. Well on his way to becoming a popular-music vocalist, he began frequenting clubs such as Segovia, where he sang accompanied by his childhood friends, Roberto Garc√≠a and Jos√© Febles. At age 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band. He moved permanently to New York on 3 May 1963, against his father's wishes, as an older brother had moved there and later died of a drug overdose. It would take many years before H√©ctor was able to reconcile with his father. Arrival in New York City Upon arriving in New York he was met by his sister Priscilla. The first thing that he did was to visit El Barrio, New York's \\"Spanish Harlem.\\" H√©ctor was disappointed by the condition of El Barrio which he had envisioned would have \\"fancy Cadillacs, tall marble skyscrapers, and tree-lined streets.\\" H√©ctor tried to earn a living as a painter, messenger, porter and concierge. One day he reconnected with his friend Roberto Garc√≠a. They began to frequent Latin music and dance clubs in the Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and Lower Manhattan. In 1965, H√©ctor met Russell Cohen, who fronted the New Yorkers - the band H√©ctor would first record with - the album Est√° de bala. H√©ctor was invited by his friend Roberto Garc√≠a, a fellow musician and childhood friend, to a rehearsal of a newly formed sextet. When he arrived, they were rehearsing the romantic bolero \\"Tus Ojos\\". The lead vocalist was singing off key, and as a goodwill gesture, Lavoe demonstrated how it was supposed to sound. As a result of this selfless act, the group offered him the job of lead vocalist, which he subsequently accepted. Later in his career he joined other salsa groups including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and Johnny Pacheco. To distinguish H√©ctor from other Latino singers, a former manager made him adopt Felipe Rodr√≠guez's moniker \\"La Voz\\" (\\"The Voice\\") and turned it into a stage name, Lavoe. In 1967, he met salsa musician and bandleader Willie Col√≥n. Johnny Pacheco, co-owner of Fania Records, and its recording musical director, suggested that Col√≥n record Lavoe on a track on Col√≥n's first album El Malo. Given the good results, Col√≥n had Lavoe recorded the rest of the album's vocal tracks. Willie never officially asked Lavoe to join his band, but after the recording, said to him: \\"On Saturday we start at 10 p.m. at El Tropicoro Club.\\" The album's success significantly transformed both Col√≥n's and Lavoe's lives. Col√≥n's band featured a raw, aggressive, all- trombone sound that was well received by salsa fans, and Lavoe complemented the style with his articulate voice, talent for improvisation, and sense of humor. The album was a massive multimillion-dollar success in France, Panama, Colombia and other countries. H√©ctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle. According to Lavoe, it happened so fast he did not know how to cope with his sudden success. With the sudden fame came love and lust and experimentation with marijuana, heroin, and cocaine. During that year, Lavoe started a romantic relationship with Carmen Castro. She became pregnant but refused to marry him because she considered him a \\"womanizer.\\" Lavoe's first son, Jos√© Alberto P√©rez, was born on 30 October 1968. On the night Jos√© was baptized, H√©ctor received a call informing him that Nilda \\"Puchi\\" Rom√°n, with whom he also had a relationship during the same period he was with Castro, was pregnant. H√©ctor's second son, H√©ctor P√©rez Jr. was born on 25 September 1969. Following the birth the couple married, and at Rom√°n's request, Lavoe had only minimum contact with Castro and Jos√© Alberto during their marriage. Music =The Willie Col√≥n years= Willie Col√≥n and Lavoe made fourteen albums together. In late 1970, Col√≥n and Lavoe recorded the first of two Asalto Navide√±o albums, featuring Puerto Rican folk songs such as Ramito's j√≠baro song \\"Patria y Amor\\", renamed \\"Canto a Borinquen\\", and original compositions., an ode to Panama's musical festivals that transposed a rather simple bass guitar line to trombone, producing a by-now classic salsa riff as a result. Lavoe's lack of professionalism was often balanced by an affable onstage presence, very much resembling that of a stand-up comedian. One famous incident involved a middle- aged audience member at a dance who requested a Puerto Rican danza from Col√≥n's band; Lavoe responded with an insult. The requester then gave Lavoe such a beating that he almost ended up in the hospital. The request was finally honored on a later Col√≥n record, El Juicio (The Trial), when he added a danza section to the Rafael Mu√±oz song \\"So√±ando despierto\\", which Lavoe introduces with a deadpanned: \\"¬°Para ti, motherflower!\\" - a euphemism for: \\"This one's for you, motherfucker!\\" The Col√≥n band had other major hits, such as \\"Calle Luna, Calle Sol\\", and the Santer√≠a-influenced \\"Aguanile\\", a Pacheco song recorded in the studio by the band. \\"Mi Gente\\", was better known for a live version Lavoe recorded later with the Fania All Stars. =Lavoe goes solo= H√©ctor Lavoe, as soloist, undated In 1973, Willie Col√≥n stopped touring to dedicate himself to record production and other business enterprises. Lavoe was given the opportunity to become the bandleader of his own orchestra. He and his band traveled the world on their own, and he would also be a guest singer with the Fania All-Stars for several shows. One of the group's notable performances took place in the Kinshasa province of the Zaire (modern day Democratic Republic of Congo) where the group performed as part of the activities promoting The Rumble in the Jungle, a boxing fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman for the heavyweight championships of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association. The Fania All Stars recorded several of their tracks during live concerts. Lavoe was part of the group when the All-Stars returned to Yankee Stadium in 1975, where the band recorded a two volume production entitled Live at Yankee Stadium. The event featured the top vocalists of Fania and Vaya records. Lavoe was included in the group along with: Ismael Miranda, Cheo Feliciano, Justo Betancourt, Ismael Quintana, Bobby Cruz, Pete \\"El Conde\\" Rodriguez, Santos Col√≥n, and Celia Cruz. Lavoe recorded songs with the band in fifteen different productions, serving as vocalist on twenty-three songs. Besides recording songs with the band, Lavoe was also present in three movies filmed and produced by Fania Records; these were: Fania All Stars: Our Latin Thing, Fania All Stars: Salsa, and Celia Cruz with the Fania All Stars: Live in Africa. His Col√≥n-produced albums would be best sellers; cuts from these albums were hits in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America: * Lavoe's recording of Tite Curet Alonso's \\"El Peri√≥dico de Ayer\\" was a number one hit on Mexican charts for four straight months. It was also a strong hit in several Caribbean countries and South America. * As a producer, Willie Col√≥n had Lavoe record what would become his signature song, the Ruben Blades-authored song \\"El Cantante\\" against Blades' protests (Blades wanted to record the song on his own.). Blades has repeatedly acknowledged since then that Lavoe raised his song to classic status and that Lavoe's performance was much better than what he would accomplish with it. * The Lavoe song \\"Bandolera\\" was a strong seller in Puerto Rico, despite vigorous protests from Puerto Rican feminists about its lyrics and soneos - Lavoe twice offers the song's subject a beating. * Lavoe's recording of the Nicol√°s Guill√©n poem \\"S√≥ngoro Cosongo\\", set to salsa music, was another major hit. * The controversial j√≠baro song, \\"Joven contra viejo\\", featured Lavoe and Daniel Santos settling their age-based differences on stage not without a heavy dose of humor and, yet again, Yomo Toro's cuatro music as a backdrop. Another major Christmas hit on Billboard Greatest Hits for Tropical genre in 1979 includes a song from singer/composer Miguel Poventud \\"Una Pena En La Navidad\\" from the same album titled Feliz Navidad. * Lavoe's final hit, \\"El Rey de la Puntualidad\\" (The King of Punctuality), is a humorous takeoff on Lavoe's constant tardiness and occasional absenteeism from shows. Lavoe followed the Santeria priest's advice and cut all communication with his family and friends for a period of two months. Following this recording H√©ctor, reappeared confident and apparently free of his drug addiction. Last years and death Lavoe's grave at Cementerio Civil de Ponce, Bo. Portugu√©s Urbano, Ponce. Following his rehabilitation, Lavoe's life was plagued by tragic events, emotional turmoil, and pain. In 1987, his seventeen-year-old son H√©ctor Jr. was accidentally shot and killed by a friend. In the same period, his apartment in Rego Park, Queens, was destroyed in a fire. One year later, H√©ctor was scheduled to perform at the Rub√©n Rodr√≠guez Coliseum in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico on the night of Saturday 25 June 1988. Sales for the concert were poor, and promoter Rick Sostre decided to cancel the concert two hours before concert time. H√©ctor, defiant to the end, and knowing that it would be one of the last times he would perform in Puerto Rico, decided, against the promoter's wishes, to perform for the public who had paid to see the concert. The next day, 26 June 1988, H√©ctor attempted suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of the Regency Hotel Condado in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He survived the attempt, but from that day forward, would never completely recover. In 1990, H√©ctor gave his last large, public performance with the Fania All Stars at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. It was meant to be his comeback concert, but H√©ctor could not even sing a few notes of his famous song \\"Mi Gente\\". It is believed his final public performance was a brief appearance at the club S.O.B.'s in New York City, in April 1992. On 29 June 1993, H√©ctor died at Saint Clare's Hospital (Manhattan) from a complication from AIDS. He was 46. He was initially buried in Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. In June 2002, the remains of Lavoe and his son were exhumed at his family's request and reburied in his native Ponce, along with his widow Nilda who had died a few weeks before. His remains are at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery), in that city's Portugu√©s Urbano neighborhood.Aplauden y sonean en honor a Lavoe. Carmen Cila Rodr√≠guez. La Perla del Sur.

The first, El Cantante, was produced by salsa artist Marc Anthony, who played Lavoe, and Jennifer Lopez as Hector's wife, Nilda (known as \\"Puchi\\" by close friends). Salsa singer La India also began production of her own biopic of Lavoe's life entitled The Singer, with actor Raul Carbonell in the lead role. Production was suspended in August 2008 after the director, Anthony Felton, reported that it was over budget. Carbonell noted that he would reconsider his involvement if production were to resume. An Off-Broadway production based on Lavoe's life titled ¬øQui√©n mat√≥ a H√©ctor Lavoe? (Who Killed Hector Lavoe?) was a success in the late 1990s. It starred singer Domingo Qui√±ones in the lead role.THEATER REVIEW; Out-of-It, Arrogant And a Salsa Legend from the New York Times 27 July 1999 Carbonell's decision to distance himself from the film directed by Felton was the direct result of his involvement in a tour of Quien Mato a H√©ctor Lavoe? in Puerto Rico, and, depending upon negotiations, possibly Peru and Colombia. An urban tribute album was released in late 2007 performed by several reggaeton artists such as Don Omar which sampled Lavoe's voice.

It is located on the Oxley Highway, 120 kilometres north west of Dubbo, and is the seat of the Warren Shire local government area. At the , Warren had a population of 1,530. Warren is included in the Central West Slopes and Plains division of the Bureau of Meteorology forecasts. Looking to the East of Warren before entering town Purple sunrise over the white and gold cotton, taken from farm in Warren Channel Irrigation for Cotton Farmers in Warren, 3 inch pipes  History  Before European settlement the area is said to have been occupied by the Ngiyambaa Aborigines. Explorer John Oxley camped on the present town site during his investigation of the Macquarie River in 1818. He noted an abundance of kangaroos and emus. Charles Sturt carried out further exploration in 1828-29. Cattle were grazing hereabouts by the late 1830s. Warren station was established in 1845 by Thomas Readford and William Lawson, the son of explorer William Lawson who was a member of the first European party to breach the Blue Mountains in 1813. Some say the name derives from a local Aboriginal word, meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"substantial\\". Another theory is that it represents the adoption of a contemporary English term, \\"warren\\", meaning a game park - perhaps a reference to the picturesque riverside setting where the station hut was built (on what is now Macquarie Park) and to the large numbers of wildlife in the area. A small police station was built near the hut to protect the new settlers from Aborigines but there being no disturbances the police soon moved on. The hut was located by the site of a river-crossing on the main route from Dubbo. Stockmen camped here in the bend by the river, adjacent to the Warren Hole (a natural and permanent waterhole), before crossing over on the gravel bar when the water was sufficiently low. A few stayed on and a site for a township was consequently surveyed in 1860 with land sales proceeding in 1861. A post office opened in 1861, a bootmaker's shop (made of bark) in 1863, a store in 1866, a school in 1867, an Anglican church in 1873, the first courthouse in 1874 and the first bridge in 1875. However, the closer settlement did not really develop until the late 1880s. Warren was incorporated as a municipality in 1895 and the Warren Weir was established in 1896. The town benefited greatly with the arrival of the railway in 1898, making it the railhead for an enormous area. In general terms, its prosperity rose and fell with the price of wool. In the 1920s the town developed quite substantially. In the Great Depression the economy shrank, expanding again in the postwar years. The eternal water shortage was greatly eased when Burrendong Dam was opened in 1967, allowing the development of cotton and produce.  Economy  Warren is one of the main centres for the wool and cotton growing industries in New South Wales. It is a well-known area for merino breeding with local studs that include Haddon Rig, Raby and Egelabra. Warren is the startup location of Commodity Broking Services (CBS), whose purpose is to aid and educate Australian farmers suffering from drought with some financial stability in commodity trading and product protection. CBS's agricultural division is still located in Warren. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 1,530 people in Warren. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 20.4% of the population. * 81.3% of people were born in Australia and 86.3% of people spoke only English at home * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 32.5%, Anglican 28.6% and No Religion 13.1%.

Signs and symptoms Female patient with depression and catalepsy Rigidity of the body produced by catalepsy Symptoms include a rigid body, rigid limbs, limbs staying in same position when moved (waxy flexibility), no response, loss of muscle control, and slowing down of bodily functions, such as breathing. Causes Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal, as well as one of the features of catatonia. It can be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics, such as haloperidol, and by the anesthetic ketamine. Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior. Unsuggested waxy catalepsy, sometimes accompanied by spontaneous anesthesia, is seen as an indicator of hypnotic trance. Suggested or induced rigid catalepsy, of extended limbs or even the entire body, sometimes tested with heavy weights, has been a staple of stage hypnosis shows and even academic demonstrations of hypnotism since the late 18th Century, as proof of extraordinary physical abilities possible in trance states. Such demonstrations have also been performed by Asian martial artists to prove the presence of \\"ki\\" or \\"chi\\" power, a kind of psychological or spiritual resource. Historical cases Armand D'Angour suggests that reports (such as that recounted in Plato's Symposium) of Socrates, in about 429 BC, standing perfectly still for hours on end during the Athenian campaign against Potidaea while seemingly deep in thought, are 'too extreme to be considered wholly a matter of rational choice,' and that 'it is reasonable to suppose that it was the symptom of an underlying physiological or psychological condition', such as catalepsy. St. Teresa of Avila experienced a prolonged bout of catalepsy that began in 1539. This episode was precipitated by the stress she was suffering at the Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation. Her legs became rigid, leaving her an invalid for three years. Teresa endured intermittent attacks of catalepsy from then on.St. Teresa of Avila, The Life of St. Teresa de Avila, 1565, chapters V, VI, and VII. Artistic depictions In the arts, catalepsy is often used for dramatic effect, sometimes as a plot device. =Literature= In William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet the kindly Friar Laurence (in the course of a botched attempt to help the lovers) provides Juliet with a catalepsy-inducing potion so effective that Romeo tragically imagines his beloved's death-like trance to be actual death and poisons himself in despair just before she awakens from her stupor - leading her to kill herself with his dagger upon discovering his suicide. In Alexandre Dumas, p√®re's novel The Count of Monte Cristo, the Abb√© Faria has fits of catalepsy from time to time, before eventually dying from one. In Eug√®ne Sue's The Mysteries of Paris, the villain Jacques Ferrand experiences a fit described as cataleptic in his final confrontation with Rodolphe, blinded by lamplight and hallucinating with visions of his fantasized Cecily. In George Eliot's Silas Marner, the main character Silas Marner frequently has cataleptic fits and seizures, an affliction which adds to his uncanny reputation as a wizard or 'cunning man' among the superstitious natives of his adopted village of Raveloe. In Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\", a man feigns catalepsy to gain access to a neurologist's rooms; the doctor attempts to treat him with amyl nitrite. In Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, the protagonist Dowell experiences catalepsy following the death of his wife. In Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, the main character Valentine Michael Smith is believed to have catalepsy when he is returned to Earth. In Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Premature Burial\\", the narrator develops catalepsy. He fears being mistakenly declared dead and buried alive, and goes to great lengths to prevent this. In another of Poe's short stories, \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", Madeline Usher has catalepsy, and is buried alive by her unstable brother Roderick. Catalepsy is also depicted in \\"Berenice\\", thus becoming one of the recurrent themes in Poe's fiction. In Poppy Z. Brite's Exquisite Corpse, the main character‚ÄîComptom, a serial killer (recreation of Jeffery Dahmer's life story) facing a lifetime sentence‚Äîuses shamanistic techniques to induce catalepsy, and, convincingly appearing deceased, is able to escape prison. In √âmile Zola's short story \\"La Mort d'Olivier Becaille\\" (\\"The Death of Olivier Becaille\\"), the title character is buried alive and notes that \\"I must have fallen into one of those cataleptic states that I had read of\\". In Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu novels, Dr. Fu-Manchu has a serum that induces a state of catalepsy so extreme as to be indistinguishable from death. In Charles Dickens's novel Bleak House, Mrs. Snagsby has violent spasms before becoming cataleptic and being carried upstairs like a grand piano. In Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek Philosophy to Plato, Hegel describes Socrates as having catalepsy caused by magnetic somnambulism when in deep meditation. In Charles Williams's novel Many Dimensions, Sir Giles Tumulty says to Lord Arglay, the Chief Justice of England: \\"You are a louse-brained catalept, Arglay.\\" In Philip K. Dick's novel Now Wait for Last Year, Kathy Sweetscent becomes immobilized by withdrawal from JJ-180, an alien (and highly addictive) drug. \\"My God, Kathy thought as she stood gazing down at the record by her feet. I can't free myself; I'm going to remain here, and they'll find me like this and know something's terribly wrong. This is catalepsy!\\" In the second chapter of √Ålvares de Azevedo's Noite na Taverna, character Solfieri rescues a woman who has catalepsy from inside a coffin. In Sheridan Le Fanu's novella The Room in the Dragon Volant a na√Øve young man falls foul of a criminal gang who employ a curious, bulbocapnine-like drug which induces catalepsy - as a result of which he narrowly escapes premature burial.

The river rises at the junction of the Rocky River and Boorolong Creek, at Yarrowyck, northwest of Uralla and flows generally northwest and west, joined by over thirty-four tributaries, including the Horton and Mehi rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Barwon River, north east of Collarenebri; descending over its course. The flow of the river is impounded by Copeton Dam, with storage used for town water supply, stock, domestic use and irrigation. The Gwydir River below Copeton Dam provides some of the wildest whitewater rafting available in Australia. Before the construction of Copeton Dam and much diversionary work, the Gwydir River flowed into the Gingham and Lower Gwydir Wetlands. The Gwydir Highway was named after the river. Geography Moree Gwydir River, downstream from Pallamallawa Moree The Gwydir river rises on the southern part of the Northern Tablelands, near the town of Uralla, and flows about generally north west and then west onto the plains where it branches somewhat, eventually joining the Barwon River, mostly as its main branch the Mehi River, which branches off to the east of Moree, before passing through it. The upper Gwydir River also passes the towns of Bundarra, Bingara, Gravesend, and Pallamallawa. Further distributaries above Moree are the Carole which then joins with the GilGil Creek to the north that flow into the Barwon River when during times of high rainfall/runoff or water deliveries. The Gwydir River further splits into two anabranch west of Moree - the Lower Gwydir or \\"Big Leather Watercourse\\" is the southern channel, and the \\"Gingham Channel\\" is the northern branch. The Gingham Channel flows west and becomes undefined in wetlands and floodplains around west of Moree. Only in larger flood events does it then join with the Ballone Creek before it flows into the Barwon River. The Big Leather Watercourse then also loses definition in wetlands and floodplains to the west and only larger floods joins with the Barwon River to the west. In turn, the Mehi River joins the Barwon River near the town of Collarenebri. Over its entire distance, the Gwydir River falls around in elevation from its headwaters, at an elevation of above sea level to when it joins the Barwon River at an elevation of above sea level. The Gwydir River's total length is , in which space and thirty-four tributaries feed into it over its entire length; including the Horton River, Warialda Creek, Laura Creek and Moredun Creek. History The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Gwydir River were the Aboriginal Kamilaroi peoples. Explorer Allan Cunningham crossed the river at Gravesend in 1827 and named it after his patron, Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydyr (), who took his title from Gwydir Castle in Wales. The Commonwealth Electoral Division of Gwydir, which was created in 1901 and ceased to exist at the 2007 federal election, was named for the Gwydir River. In Australia the name is pronounced to rhyme with \\"wider,\\" whereas the Welsh name is pronounced roughly \\"Gwidd-eer.\\" The iron lattice bridges crossing the Gwydir River at Bundarra and Bingara are regarded as significant bridges of the colonial period. Around mid-1838 a war of extirpation, according to local magistrate Edward Denny Day, was waged all along the Gwydir River. Aborigines in the district were repeatedly pursued by parties of mounted and armed stockmen and Day claimed that great numbers of them had been killed at various spots. Agriculture A lot of irrigated cotton is grown near Moree, as well as many other crops, livestock and agricultural enterprises. The cotton industry relies on irrigation and has been affected by recent drought with water allocations to farms severely reduced. In 2006 it was calculated that the cotton industry consumed 87% of the agricultural water taken from the Gwydir River. Irrigation in the upper Gwydir led to a severe reduction in natural flows downstream. The reduction in water flow has affected landholders who traditionally grazed on wetlands and floodplains and in areas where the waters from the river were used to supplement stock drinking water and for minor watering of pasture and small areas of crops. It also reduced or stopped periodical flushes of water into ephemeral creeks, watercourses and wetlands in the Gingham, Lower Gwydir and Mallowa and other smaller systems. These conflicts resulted in the establishment of the Gwydir Regulated River Management Committee in 1997 and then the Gwydir Environmental Contingency Allowance Operation Advisory Committee when the Gwydir Water Sharing Plan came into effect on 1 July 2004. Environment =Wetlands= The Gwydir wetlands are an important breeding site for Australian white ibises Some of the privately owned Gwydir Wetlands were designated on 14 June 1999 as a Ramsar site as a wetland of international importance. Some of the Gwydir Wetlands have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because, when they receive adequate water inflows, they support more breeding waterbirds than any other site in the country. At times more than half a million nesting waterbirds have been present, including over 1% of the world populations of nankeen night herons, intermediate egrets, and of white and straw-necked ibises. The endangered Australasian bittern, Black-necked stork and other threatened species have been recorded. The Namoi River snapping turtle or Bell's turtle (Elseya belli) is found only in the upper reaches of the Namoi, Gwydir and Macdonald Rivers on the NSW North West Slopes.

Radiƒá travelled to Kiev and was allowed to stay at the city's Monastery of the Caves where he remained for six weeks before returning to Croatia. In September 1891 he enrolled in law at the University of Zagreb.Branka Boban, Mladi Stjepan Radiƒá o Srbima u Hrvatskoj i odnosima Hrvata i Srba, Radovi Zavod za hrvatsku povijest, Vol 28, Zagreb, 1995. He was selected as a representative of the student body at the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Sisak in 1893. After criticizing the Ban of Croatia K√°roly Khuen-H√©derv√°ry during the ceremony and referring to him as a \\"Magyar hussar\\", Radiƒá was sentenced to four months in prison which he served in Petrinja. He was among a group of students who set fire to the Hungarian tricolour on 16 October 1895 during the visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Zagreb. For this, Radiƒá received a prison sentence and was expelled from the University of Zagreb, as well as barred from all universities in the Monarchy. After spending some time in Russia and, later, Prague, Radiƒá continued his studies at the √âcole libre des sciences politiques in Paris, where he graduated in 1899. =Lead up to the first Yugoslavia= After World War I he had opposed the merging of Croatia with the Kingdom of Serbia without guarantees of Croatian autonomy. Radiƒá was selected as a member of the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 24 November 1918 he famously urged delegates attending a session that would decide the country's political future not to \\"rush like geese into fog\\". He was the lone member of the National Council's central committee to vote against sending a delegation to Belgrade to negotiate with the Kingdom of Serbia.Zlatko Matijeviƒá, Narodno vijeƒáe Slovenaca, Hrvata i Srba u Zagrebu, Hrvatski institut za povijest. On 26 November, he was removed from the central committee. Under pressure from the Great powers (British Empire, France, United States), as well as honouring the secret deals that were struck between the Entente and the Kingdom of Serbia, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established and two representatives of Radiƒá's party (by then named the Croatian Common-people Peasant Party) were appointed to the Provisional Representation which served as a parliament until elections for the Constituent could be held. The party's representatives, however, decided not to take their seats. =Arrest= On 8 March 1919 the central committee passed a resolution penned by Radiƒá that declared \\"Croatian citizens do not recognize the so called Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty because this kingdom was proclaimed other than by the Croatian Sabor and without any mandate of the Croatian People.\\" The full statement was included in a Memorandum which was translated into French and sent abroad to be addressed to the Paris Peace Conference.Zlatko Matijeviƒá, Prilozi za politiƒçku biografiju dr. Ljudevita Ke≈æmana: od \\"Memoranduma\\" za Mirovnu konferenciju u Parizu do odlaska u Sjedinjene Ameriƒçke Dr≈æave (1919.-1922.), ƒåasopis za suvremenu povijest, God. 38., br. 3., 757.-778. (2006) This act provoked a decision by the government to arrest Radiƒá along with several other party members. He was to be held some 11 months until February 1920, just before the first parliamentary elections of the Kingdom of SHS to a Constitutional Assembly which were held on 28 November. The result of the November election was 230,590 votes, which equaled to 50 seats in the parliament out of 419. On 8 December, before the first sitting of parliament, Radiƒá held a massive rally in front of 100,000 people in Zagreb. Stjepan Radiƒá and the CCPP held an extraordinary meeting, in which a motion was put forward and voted on that the party will not be part of parliamentary discussions before matters are first resolved with Serbia on the matters of governance, the most sticking issues being the minorisation of the Croatian people and the overt powers of the King with the central government in Belgrade. The party was subsequently renamed to the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, highlighting the party's official stance. In December, ban of Croatia Matko Laginja was dismissed by the cabinet of Milenko Radomar Vesniƒá for allowing the rally to take place. =The new Constitution= On 12 December 1920, the Parliament of SHS had their first sitting, without the representatives of CPP (50 representatives) and the Croatian Party of Rights (2 representatives). A total of 342 representatives presented their credentials out of a total of 419. On 28 June 1921, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was made law after a vote of 223 representatives out of the present 285, the total number representatives in the parliament being 419. The representatives turnout and subsequent vote is quite poor considering that it was a constitutive parliament, which was supposed to have created the new constitution. The constitution was commonly known as the Vidovdan (St. Vitus Day) Constitution after the anniversary of the Serbian Battle of Kosovo, also the anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. In the next parliamentary elections, which were held in March 1923, the stance of Stjepan Radiƒá and the CPP against the central government managed to turn into extra votes. The results of the election were, 70 seats or 473.733 votes, which represented the majority of the Croatian vote in Northern and Southern parts of Croatia, as well as the Croatian votes in Bosnia, as well as Herzegovina. =Again imprisoned= Radiƒá still held on to the idea of an independent Croatia, and kept the party out of parliament in protest. This in effect afforded Serbian prime minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá the opportunity to consolidate power and strengthen his Serb-dominated government. Returning from an unsanctioned overseas trip in 1923 in which Stjepan Radiƒá visited England (for 5 months), Austria (5 months) and the Soviet Union (2 months). upon his return in 1924, Radiƒá was arrested in Zagreb and sentenced for associating with Soviet Communists and imprisoned. The trip was used for the purpose of internationalising the plight of Croatians in the Kingdom of SHS. After his release, Stjepan Radiƒá soon reentered politics, but this was not without problems. On 23 December, the Serb dominated central government declared that the political party CRPP was in contravention of the Internal security law of 1921 in the infamous Obznana declaration, and this was confirmed by King Alexander on 1 January 1924, thus arresting the CRPP executive on 2 January 1925, and finally arresting Stjepan Radiƒá on 5 January. After the parliamentary elections in February 1925, the CRPP even with its whole executive team behind bars, and with only Stjepan Radiƒá at its helm, CRPP managed to win 67 parliamentary seats with a total of 532,872 votes. Even though the vote count was higher than at the previous election, the gerrymandering by the central government ensured that CRPP received fewer parliamentary seats. In order to increase his negotiating power the CRPP entered into a coalition with the Independent Democratic party (Samostalna demokratska stranka), Slovenian People's Party (Slovenska ljudska stranka) and the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (Jugoslavenska muslimanska organizacija). =Return to Parliament= Immediately after the parliamentary elections in March 1925, the CRPP changed the party name to Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljaƒçka stranka). With the backing of the coalition partners, the CPP made an agreement with the major conservative Serbian party - the People's Radical Party (Narodna radikalna stranka), in which a power-sharing arrangement was struck, as well as a deal to release the CPP executive from jail. The CPP had to make certain concessions like recognising the central government and the rule of the monarch, as well as the Vidovdan constitution in front of the full parliament on 27 March 1925. Stjepan Radiƒá was made the Minister for Education, whereas other CPP party members obtained ministerial posts: Pavle Radiƒá, Nikola Nikiƒá, Benjamin ≈†uperina, and Ivan Krajaƒç. This powersharing arrangement was cut short after the passing away of the president of the Peoples Radical Party, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, on 10 December 1926. Radiƒá soon resigned his ministerial post in 1926 and returned to the opposition, and in 1927 entered into a coalition with Svetozar Pribiƒáeviƒá, president of the Independent Democratic Party, a leading party of the Serbs in Croatia. The Peasant-Democrat coalition had a real chance to end the Radicals' long-time stranglehold control of the Parliament. Previously they had long been opponents, but the Democrats became disillusioned with the Belgrade bureaucracy and restored good relations with the Peasant Party with which they were allies in the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With this arrangement, Stjepan Radiƒá managed to obtain a parliamentary majority in 1928. However, he was not able to form a government. The Peasant-Democrat coalition was opposed by some of the Croatian elite, like Ivo Andriƒá, who even regarded the followers of the CPP as \\"...fools following a blind dog...\\" (the blind dog being Stjepan Radiƒá). In his elder days, Radiƒá was nearly blind. =Assassination in Parliament= Assassination in Belgrade Stjepan Radiƒá's grave on Mirogoj Cemetery Death threats and threats of violent beatings were made against Stjepan Radiƒá in parliament, without any intervention by the president of the Assembly (Parliamentary speaker). On the morning of 20 June 1928, Radiƒá was warned of the danger of an assassination attempt against him and was begged to stay away from the Assembly for that day. He replied that he was like a soldier in war, in the trenches and as such it was his duty to go but he nevertheless promised not to utter a single word. In the Assembly, Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá, a member of People's Radical Party from Montenegro, got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radiƒá himself stayed completely silent. Finally, Ivan Pernar shouted in response, \\"thou plundered beys\\" (referring to accusations of corruption related to him). In an earlier speech Radiƒá accused Raƒçiƒá of stealing from civilian population and later refused to apologize when Raƒçiƒá asked him to. Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá made his way to the speaker podium facing the Croats. He put his hand in his pocket, where he held the revolver, and faced the president Ninko Periƒá and told him: \\"I ask of you, Mr. president, to sanction Pernar. If you fail to stop me, I shall punish him myself!\\" After that threat shouting started in the room. But Raƒçiƒá continued his threats: \\"Whoever tries to stand between me and Pernar will be killed!\\" At that moment Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá took out his parabellum. Minister Vujiƒçiƒá, sitting at the bench behind Raƒçiƒá, grabbed his hand in order to stop him. At the same time, minister Kujund≈æiƒá came to his aid, but Raƒçiƒá, however, being very strong, broke himself free. At exactly 11:25 AM shots were fired - Pernar was hit 1 cm above the heart. When he collapsed, Raƒçiƒá took aim at Stjepan Radiƒá. ƒêuro Basariƒçek noticed this and leaped to help him. Raƒçiƒá, however, turned his way and shot him, bullet entering his loins and exiting around his scapula. Basariƒçek fainted immediately. Ivan Granƒëa ran in front of Stjepan Radiƒá and Raƒçiƒá shot him in the arm. As soon as he was down, Raƒçiƒá aimed at Stjepan Radiƒá, and shot him in the chest. At that point Pavle Radiƒá jumped towards Raƒçiƒá, who didn't get confused, but remarked: \\"Ha! I've been looking for you!\\" and shot him 1 cm below the heart. It was believed Raƒçiƒá would shoot Svetozar Pribiƒçeviƒá, sitting next to Stjepan Radiƒá, next, but Raƒçiƒá instead left the room through the ministers' chambers. The whole assassination was over in less than a minute. It was one of the first assassinations in a government building in history.Zvonimir Kulund≈æiƒá: Atentat na Stjepana Radiƒáa (The assassination of Stjepan Radiƒá) Radiƒá was left for dead and indeed had such a serious stomach wound (he was also a diabetic) that he died several weeks later at the age of 57. His funeral was officiated by archbishop Antun Bauer of Zagreb. His burial was massively attended and his death was seen as causing a permanent rift in Croat-Serb relations in the old Yugoslavia. What exactly happened to Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá is still contested. One version (conservative) states that he was sentenced to 20 years of house arrest and later pardoned by the Serb authorities while another (communist) contends that he was sentenced to 20 years of hard labour and freed by the invading Nazis in WWII. He led a normal life during the Nazi occupation of Serbia and was captured and killed by Communist partisans in 1945 or 1946. Following the political crisis triggered by the shooting, in January 1929, King Aleksandar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá abolished the constitution, dissolved the parliament, banned all ethnic, regional and religious political parties, and declared a royal dictatorship. Radiƒá is buried in the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb. Legacy Radiƒá's violent death turned him into a martyr and an icon of political struggle for the peasantry and the working class, as well as an icon of Croatian patriots. The iconography of Stjepan Radiƒá was later used not only by his successor Vladko Maƒçek, but also by other political options in Croatia: right wing or left wing. The Usta≈°e used the death of Stjepan Radiƒá as proof of Serbian hegemony, and as an excuse for their treatment of Serbs. However, a number of leading CPP figures who became political opponents of the Ustashe were imprisoned or killed by the regime. The Partisans on the other hand used this as a recruiting point with CPP members who were disillusioned with the Independent State of Croatia, and latter had one brigade named after Antun and Stjepan Radiƒá in 1943. The image of Stjepan Radiƒá was used extensively during the Croatian Spring movement in the early 1970s. There are many folk groups, clubs, primary and secondary schools which bear the name of Stjepan Radiƒá. Many Croatian cities have streets and squares in his name. In 2008, a total of 265 streets in Croatia were named after him, making Radiƒá the third most common person eponym of streets in the country. Statues of Stjepan Radiƒá are also common. His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 200 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.Croatian National Bank . Features of Kuna Banknotes : 200 kuna (1993 issue) & 200 kuna (2002 issue). ‚Äì Retrieved on 30 March 2009. Since 1995 the Republic of Croatia has awarded the Order of Stjepan Radiƒá. In 2015 the Croatian Parliament declared 20 June to be the Memorial Day for Stjepan Radiƒá and the June Victims. In 1997, a poll in Croatian weekly Nacional named Stjepan Radiƒá as the most admired Croatian historic personality. =Anti-clericalism= Stjepan Radiƒá was a Roman Catholic, but at the same time extremely anti-clerical. In a 1924 rally in Kra≈°iƒá, birthplace of the late Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac, he stated: \\"Priests or bishops are teachers of the faith and as such we are listening to them in church, and even outside the church. But when they mistake religion with politics, with such gentile politics of revenge, blood, arrogance and gluttony, they are not teachers, but destroyers of faith and church. (...) When our bishops write a political letter, and when they want to be political leaders to the Croatian people, then it is my and our duty to decipher it and if necessary, condemn it.\\" In an interview for Nova revija in 1926 he stated that \\"clericalism means abuse of the most sacred feelings of religion in order to destroy the family, to demolish people in order to gain political power.\\"Nova revija, no. 1, p. 67-68 He would often repeat the slogan: Believe in God, but not in the priest. He supported the establishment of the Indigenous Croatian Catholic Church, and its separation from the Vatican. The secularist association \\"Voice of Reason - The Movement for a Secular Croatia\\" uses his portrait as its logo.

At the 2006 census, Manilla had a population of 2,550 people. Manilla is famous for its setting as a fishing and paragliding area and soon to be the destination for ABCs Triple J \\"one night stand\\" music festival. The name Manilla comes from the Gamilaraay language, and is said to mean 'winding river'. Manilla was established in the 1850s at the junction of the Namoi River and the Manilla River. It was formerly the centre of Manilla Shire local government area, but this was amalgamated with Tamworth City Council and portions of Parry, Barraba and Nundle Shire Councils to form Tamworth Regional Council in 2004. It lies next to the Bundarra-Barraba Important Bird Area which is important for the conservation of the critically endangered regent honeyeater. Manilla is also well known for Split Rock Dam on the Manilla River and Lake Keepit on the Namoi River.

During the 1850s, teamsters with bullock waggons were regularly transporting goods from the Hunter District through the Manilla area to outlying cattle stations and the northern goldfield settlements of Bingara and Bundarra. Teams were often delayed at the junction of the Namoi and Manilla Rivers by high water. In 1853, enterprising Englishman George Veness arrived at ‚ÄòThe Junction‚Äô to set up a store and wine shop at the teamsters‚Äô camping ground. In doing so, Veness led the way to town settlement and is acknowledged as the Founder of Manilla. The town's early prosperity was founded on the highly productive wheat and pastoral industries. Manilla also features a new library centre. Located within the Tamworth Regional Council office in the main street of Manilla, the library is a new type of facility which is known globally as a convergence centre. This means there are many facilities on offer including Centrelink Agency, the Manilla Book Club, a free weekly Storytime for preschool aged children and many other community activities.

The symptoms include decreased growth hormone (GH) and somatomedin secretion, very short stature, weight that is inappropriate for the height, and immature skeletal age. This disease is a progressive one, and as long as the child is left in the stressing environment, their cognitive abilities continue to degenerate. Though rare in the population at large, it is common in feral children and in children kept in abusive, confined conditions for extended lengths of time. It can cause the body to completely stop growing but is generally considered to be temporary; regular growth will resume when the source of stress is removed. Cause Children with PSS have extremely low levels of growth hormone. These children possibly have a problem with growth hormone inhibiting hormone (GHIH) or growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). The children could either be unresponsive to GHRH, or too sensitive to GHIH. Children who have PSS exhibit signs of failure to thrive. Even though they appear to be receiving adequate nutrition, they do not grow and develop normally compared to other children of their age. An environment of constant and extreme stress causes PSS. Stress-released hormones in the body such as epinephrine and norepinephrine engage what is known as the 'fight or flight' response. The heart speeds up and the body diverts resources away from processes that are not immediately important; in PSS, the production of growth hormone (GH) is thus affected. As well as lacking growth hormone, children with PSS exhibit gastrointestinal problems due to the large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in their bodies lacking proper digestion of nutrients and further affecting development. While the cure for PSS is questionable, some studies show that placing the child affected with the disease in a foster or group home increases growth rate and socialization skills. Society and culture One case was a child who was admitted to a hospital with an extremely low weight. One nurse took over his care and he began to rapidly gain weight and his growth hormone levels increased during this time. The child was so dependent on the nurse emotionally that when she left, his levels returned to what they had been when he was admitted to the hospital, and once she returned, they stabilized once more. When a police raid in 1987 released the children held by an Australian cult known as The Family, one twelve-year-old girl weighed under 20 kg (44 lbs) and was under 120 cm (4 ft) tall. She grew 11 cm (4 in) in the following year and her growth hormone levels returned to normal. =Fictional characters= In G√ºnter Grass's 1959 novel The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel), the character Oskar Matzerath \\"willfully stunted his growth at three feet tall as a three-year-old, although later in the novel he grows to four feet one inch\\"Grass's own description in reaction to the stress he experiences ‚Äì the petit-bourgeois German society. In the novel Les Mis√©rables by Victor Hugo, eight-year old Cosette had been abused, neglected and enslaved by the Th√®nardier family. The extreme abuse and neglect she faces is described as very stressful for her, and as a result she is described as simultaneously being as short as a child half her age and having an expression more appropriate for an older woman. She recovers after she is adopted by Jean Valjean and is of average height as an adult. In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chief Bromden claims that one of Nurse Ratched's orderlies, Williams, a black man with dwarfism, gained his short stature from seeing white men rape his mother. In the novel Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews, twins Cory and Carrie Dollanganger are locked in an attic (with their two older siblings). The stress of their grandmother's abuse and lack of attention from their mother ‚Äî along with arsenic poisoning and lack of outdoor play opportunities ‚Äî stunts the twins' growth. Later in the series, Carrie is described as being eight years old, yet her physical appearance is that of a three-year-old.

Rheumatism does not designate any specific disorder, but covers at least 200 different conditions, including arthritis and \\"non-articular rheumatism\\", also known as \\"regional pain syndrome\\" or \\"soft tissue rheumatism\\". There is a close overlap between the term soft tissue disorder and rheumatism. Sometimes the term \\"soft tissue rheumatic disorders\\" is used to describe these conditions. The term \\"Rheumatic Diseases\\" is used in MeSH to refer to connective tissue disorders. The branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and therapy of rheumatism is called rheumatology. Types Many rheumatic disorders of chronic, intermittent pain (including joint pain, neck pain or back pain) have historically been caused by infectious diseases. Their etiology was unknown until the 20th century and not treatable, like Lyme disease (in the Northern, Northeastern, and Appalachians of the US), coccidiomycosis or valley fever (in the Western US), and chikungunya in India, Africa, and South America. Postinfectious arthritis, also known as reactive arthritis, and rheumatic fever are other examples. Major rheumatic disorders can divided into 10 major categories based on the nomenclature and classification proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1983, and they are: * Diffuse connective tissue diseases ** Rheumatoid arthritis **Juvenile arthritis **Systemic lupus erythematosus **Sj√∂gren syndrome **Scleroderma **Polymyositis **Dermatomyositis **Beh√ßet's disease **Relapsing polychondritis * Arthritis associated with spondylitis (i.e., spondarthritis) ** Ankylosing spondylitis ** Reactive arthritis ** Psoriatic arthritisJaneways: \\"immunology\\" * Osteoarthritis (i.c., osteoarthrosis, degenerative joint disease) * Rheumatic syndromes associated with infectious agents (direct and indirect or reactive) * Metabolic and endocrine diseases associated with rheumatic states ** Gout, pseudogout * Neoplasms * Neurovascular disorders * Bone and cartilage disorders * Extraarticular disorders ** Bursitis/Tendinitis of the shoulder, wrist, biceps, leg, knee cap (patella), ankle, hip, and Achilles tendon **Capsulitis * Miscellaneous disorders associated with articular manifestations **Palindromic rheumatism has been theorized to be a form of rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment A vast number of traditional herbal remedies have been recommended for \\"rheumatism\\". Modern medicine, recognises that the different rheumatic disorders have different causes (and several of them have multiple causes) and require different kinds of treatment. Nevertheless, initial therapy of the major rheumatological diseases is with analgesics, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), members of which are ibuprofen and naproxen. Often, stronger analgesics are required. The ancient Greeks recorded that bee venom had some beneficial effects on some types of rheumatism. Bee and ant stings were known as a folk remedy in the late 19th century, and at least one physician developed a treatment consisting of repeated formic acid injections. Certain Amazonian tribes, including the Zo'√©, use fire ant stings as a remedy for aches and pains.Isolated: The Zo'√© tribe (documentary) Cod liver oil has also been used as a remedy. Neem Tree Oil according to East Indian cultures has also been used as a remedy.Isha Foundation History The term rheumatism stems from the Late Latin rheumatismus, ultimately from Greek ·ø•ŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒØŒ∂ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ \\"to suffer from a flux\\", with rheum meaning bodily fluids, i.e. any discharge of blood or bodily fluid. Before the 17th century, the joint pain which was thought to be caused by viscous humours seeping into the joints was always referred to as gout, a word adopted in Middle English from Old French gote \\"a drop; the gout, rheumatism\\", not to be confused with the present day specific term referring to excess of uric acid. The English term rheumatism in the current sense has been in use since the late 17th century, as it was believed that chronic joint pain was caused by excessive flow of rheum which means bodily fluids into a joint.Barnhart, Robert K., ed., Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, H.W. Wilson Co., 1988.

East Gordon is a locality within Gordon and West Gordon within West Pymble.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007  History  The name 'Gordon' first appears as the name of the survey parish covering most of the upper north shore, assigned by the NSW Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell. This is believed to commemorate Sir Willoughby Gordon, with whom he had served during the Peninsular War and who was the quartermaster-general of the regiment in which Mitchell had served. The survey parish, and later suburb and municipality of Willoughby also commemorates his name.http://www.khs.org.au/local/gordon.html Settlement of the area commenced about 1820. The early settlement at Gordon was originally known as Lane Cove. The earliest school at 'Lane Cove', as Gordon was then known, was established at the behest of Governor Macquarie in 1816. The first Lane Cove Post Office opened on 1 February 1860. The name of the village and Post Office was changed to Gordon, after the Gordondale estate of Robert McIntosh, on 1 June 1879. Gordon Railway Station on the North Shore Line was built in 1888. In the late 20th century Gordon was the Australian headquarters of Sun Microsystems Australia (opposite the present era Gordon library site). It also had a significant Ikea store on the corner of the Pacific Highway and Ryde Road (opposite the former 3M site on the northern or Pymble side of the intersection, circa 2014-2020 under legally frustrated intent to renovate for use by Bunnings). = Gordon Public School = The former Gordon Public School, now largely demolished and rebuilt as the library and police station, was constructed in 1878 on the Pacific Highway, having been designed by George Mansfield. A Gothic Revival style was used in accordance with the tradition that educational buildings, like churches, were designed in a Gothic style. A second block was added in 1912. The school was originally called Lane Cove School, and the name was officially changed to Gordon Public School in November 1885. The school buildings are one of the few remaining buildings that date back to the pioneering days of northern Sydney. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/33 The Gordon Public School was closed in 1989, however East Gordon Public School and West Gordon Public School remain nearby. = Heritage listings = Gordon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 17 McIntosh Street: Eryldene, Gordon * Middlemiss Street: Gordon railway station, Sydney * 691 Pacific Highway: Iolanthe, Gordon * 707 Pacific Highway: Tulkiyan * 799 Pacific Highway: Gordon Public School (former) In addition, Gordon is home to Sydney's largest flying fox colony, land for the protection of which was jointly purchased by the Heritage Council of New South Wales and Kuringai Council. = Notable former residents = * Dr John Bradfield, chief engineer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, lived in Gordon where his grave is located at St Johns Anglican Church. * Annie Wyatt was the founder of the National Trust in Australia.

Gordon railway station is on the North Shore & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network with frequent commuter services. The railway station was built in 1888 and has an important heritage relationship with its landscaped gardens; it has been preserved as an example of a historic Edwardian station. Lifts to the platforms have been a recent addition. A bus stop outside the station is a terminus for various routes including those to St Ives, West Pymble, Mona Vale/Warriewood and Macquarie University. These are operated by Forest Coach Lines. = Churches = Churches in Gordon comprise: St Johns Anglican Church (with an adjoining cemetery and columbarium), Gordon Uniting Church, Gordon Baptist Church and The Liberal Catholic Church of St. Francis. = Education = Gordon is home to two schools: *Gordon East Public School (K-6) *Ravenswood School for Girls (K-12) Gordon West Public School is named for the suburb, but is located in West Pymble. Gordon Community Preschool supports children from 3 ‚Äì 5 years of age. = Commercial = Gordon has a commercial area with many shops and restaurants along the Pacific Highway and around Gordon railway station. Gordon Centre, is a shopping centre owned by Charter Hall which includes a Harvey Norman, Woolworths and many stores and offices. Gordon Centre was originally built as a Farmers & Co department store, now part of Myer, before reopening as Gordon Centre in 1985. Household hardware chain Bunnings Warehouse and McDonald's is located near the Pacific Highway. Gordon Village Arcade is a shopping arcade also owned by Charter Hall and includes many stores including a post office. Gordon Private Hospital located on the Pacific Highway specialises in the treatment of mental health and is a teaching hospital affiliated with UNSW. The administrative buildings for the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council are located in Gordon. = Residential = Eryldene is a local historic house that is open to the public. Located in McIntosh Street, the house was designed for Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse by William Hardy Wilson and built circa 1913. The extensive garden is a significant part of the property in its own right. House and garden as a whole are listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, p.2/33 The house also has a state heritage listing.State Heritage Website Another notable home in the area is Tulkiyan, located on the Pacific Highway. This home was designed by Bertrand James Waterhouse, an architect who was popular for his residential work (he was also responsible for the design of Nutcote, the home of painter May Gibbs). He designed Tulkiyan in the Arts and Crafts style that he favoured in much of his work. Tulkiyan was built on part of a land grant that went back to 1823. The land changed hands many times until it was acquired by the Donaldson family, who commissioned Waterhouse to design the house. It stayed in the hands of the Donaldson family until 1994, when it was bequeathed to Ku-ring-gai Council. Tulkiyan has a state heritage listing.State Heritage Website The Arts and Crafts style favoured by Waterhouse was just one of the styles that were part of the Federation period that went from 1890 to 1915. Other prominent styles were the Federation Queen Anne style‚Äîthe Australian version of the English Queen Anne style‚Äîand the Federation Bungalow style. Some notable examples of the latter style can be seen in Nelson Street, Gordon. Other architects who favoured Federation styles were Walter Liberty Vernon and Howard Joseland. Gordon is also the location of a notable house designed by the architect Alexander Stewart Jolly. Nebraska, in Yarabah Avenue, is a distinctive home reminiscent of a log cabin. One of its features is the irregular stonework. It is heritage-listed.State Heritage Website 56.6% of occupied private dwellings in Gordon are separate houses, 39.3% are flats, units or apartments and 4.0% are semi-detached (mainly townhouses).

It is 13 kilometres north-west of the Sydney Central Business District and is in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. East Lindfield is a separate suburb, although they share the postcode of 2070. This suburb of 5.17 square kilometres contains residential housing of California bungalow and federation style, in double brick and tile construction. Australian native bushland in Garigal National Park and Lane Cove National Park borders the suburb.  History  Lindfield was originally the home of the Kuringgai indigenous people. Europeans first became active in the area in around 1810, when the colonial government set up a timber gathering camp staffed by convicts. By the 1840s, fruit growing and farming became the suburb's primary industries. Settlement began to increase in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Lindfield railway station opened in 1890, and Lindfield Post Office opened on 5 January 1895. Land values increased in the area around the railway and more professionals moved into the area. The name \\"Lindfield\\" means a clearing in the lime forest, and derives from the name given by an early landowner, Francis List, to a cottage he built in the area in 1884. List likely named his cottage after Lindfield, Sussex, England. When a railway line came through the area in 1890s, the name of the property was used to identify the station and neighbourhood.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 154 During the years after World War II the suburb experienced significant growth.

The classic feature of psoriatic arthritis is swelling of entire fingers and toes with a sausage-like appearance. This often happens in association with changes to the nails such as small depressions in the nail (pitting), thickening of the nails, and detachment of the nail from the nailbed. Skin changes consistent with psoriasis (e.g., red, scaly, and itchy plaques) frequently occur before the onset of psoriatic arthritis but psoriatic arthritis can precede the rash in 15% of affected individuals. It is classified as a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Genetics are thought to be strongly involved in the development of psoriatic arthritis. Obesity and certain forms of psoriasis are thought to increase the risk. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of people with psoriasis and occurs in both children and adults. Approximately 40‚Äì50% of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have the HLA-B27 genotype. The condition is less common in people of Asian or African descent and affects men and women equally.  Signs and symptoms  Pain, swelling, or stiffness in one or more joints is commonly present in psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is inflammatory, and affected joints are generally red or warm to the touch. Asymmetrical oligoarthritis, defined as inflammation affecting two to four joints during the first six months of disease, is present in 70% of cases. However, in 15% of cases, the arthritis is symmetrical. The joints of the hand that is involved in psoriasis are the proximal interphalangeal (PIP), the distal interphalangeal (DIP), the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and the wrist. Involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) is a characteristic feature and is present in 15% of cases. In addition to affecting the joints of the hands and wrists, psoriatic arthritis may affect the fingers, nails, and skin. Sausage-like swelling in the fingers or toes, known as dactylitis, may occur. Psoriasis can also cause changes to the nails, such as pitting or separation from the nail bed, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis under the nails, and horizontal ridging. Psoriasis classically presents with scaly skin lesions, which are most commonly seen over extensor surfaces such as the scalp, natal cleft and umbilicus. In psoriatic arthritis, pain can occur in the area of the sacrum (the lower back, above the tailbone), as a result of sacroiliitis or spondylitis, which is present in 40% of cases. Pain can occur in and around the feet and ankles, especially enthesitis in the Achilles tendon (inflammation of the Achilles tendon where it inserts into the bone) or plantar fasciitis in the sole of the foot. Along with the above-noted pain and inflammation, there is extreme exhaustion that does not go away with adequate rest. The exhaustion may last for days or weeks without abatement. Psoriatic arthritis may remain mild or may progress to more destructive joint disease. Periods of active disease, or flares, will typically alternate with periods of remission. In severe forms, psoriatic arthritis may progress to arthritis mutilansDavidson, Stanley, Davidson's principles and practice of medicine, Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier, p. 1096, 2010. . Accessed 2016-11-12. which on X-ray gives a \\"pencil-in-cup\\" appearance. Because prolonged inflammation can lead to joint damage, early diagnosis and treatment to slow or prevent joint damage is recommended.  Causes  The exact causes are not yet known, but a number of genetic associations have been identified in a genome-wide association study of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis including HLA-B27.  Diagnosis  Magnetic resonance images of the fingers in psoriatic arthritis. Shown are T1-weighted (a) pre-contrast and (b) post-contrast coronal images. Enhancement of the synovial membrane at the third and fourth proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints is seen, indicating active synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane; large arrows). There is joint space narrowing with bone proliferation at the third PIP joint and erosions are present at the fourth DIP joint (white circle). Extracapsular enhancement (small arrows) is seen medial to the third and fourth PIP joints, indicating probable enthesitis (inflammation of a tendon insertion). Sagittal magnetic resonance images of the ankle region in psoriatic arthritis. (a) Short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image, showing high signal intensity at the Achilles tendon insertion (enthesitis, thick arrow) and in the synovium of the ankle joint (synovitis, long thin arrow). Bone marrow edema is seen at the tendon insertion (short thin arrow). (b, c) T1 weighted images of a different section of the same patient, before (panel b) and after (panel c) intravenous contrast injection, confirm inflammation (large arrow) at the enthesis and reveal bone erosion at tendon insertion (short thin arrows). There is no definitive test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis may closely resemble other diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. A rheumatologist (a physician specializing in autoimmune diseases) may use physical examinations, health history, blood tests and x-rays to accurately diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Factors that contribute to a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis include the following: * Psoriasis in the patient, or a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. * A negative test result for rheumatoid factor, a blood factor associated with rheumatoid arthritis. * Arthritis symptoms in the distal Interphalangeal articulations of hand (the joints closest to the tips of the fingers). This is not typical of rheumatoid arthritis. * Ridging or pitting of fingernails or toenails (onycholysis), which is associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. * Radiologic images demonstrating degenerative joint changes. Other symptoms that are more typical of psoriatic arthritis than other forms of arthritis include enthesitis (inflammation in the Achilles tendon (at the back of the heel) or the plantar fascia (bottom of the feet)), and dactylitis (sausage-like swelling of the fingers or toes).

Focal increased signal (probable erosion) is seen at the base of the middle phalanx (long thin arrow). There is synovitis at the proximal interphalangeal joint (long thick arrow) plus increased signal in the overlying soft tissues indicating edema (short thick arrow). There is also diffuse bone edema (short thin arrows) involving the head of the proximal phalanx and extending distally down the shaft.

File:Psoriatic arthritis spine ar1934-6.gif(a) T1-weighted and (b) short tau inversion recovery (STIR) magnetic resonance images of lumbar and lower thoracic spine in psoriatic arthritis. Signs of active inflammation are seen at several levels (arrows). In particular, anterior spondylitis is seen at level L1/L2 and an inflammatory Andersson lesion at the upper vertebral endplate of L3. File:Sacroiliitis MRI ar1934-5.gifMagnetic resonance images of sacroiliac joints. Shown are T1-weighted semi-coronal magnetic resonance images through the sacroiliac joints (a) before and (b) after intravenous contrast injection. Enhancement is seen at the right sacroiliac joint (arrow, left side of the image), indicating active sacroiliitis. =Differential diagnosis= Several conditions can mimic the clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, reactive arthritis, gouty arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis. In contrast to psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the proximal joints (e.g., the metacarpophalangeal joints), involves a greater number of joints than psoriatic arthritis, and affect them symmetrically. Involvement of the spinal joints is more suggestive of psoriatic arthritis than rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis shares certain clinical features with psoriatic arthritis such as its tendency to affect multiple distal joints in an asymmetric pattern. Unlike psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis does not typically involve inflammation of the sacroiliac joint. Psoriatic arthritis sometimes affects only one joint and is sometimes confused for gout or pseudogout when this happens. = Classification = There are five main types of psoriatic arthritis: * Oligoarticular: This type affects around 70% of patients and is generally mild. This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints. * Polyarticular: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects five or more joints on both sides of the body simultaneously. This type is most similar to rheumatoid arthritis and is disabling in around 50% of all cases. * Arthritis mutilans (): Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming and destructive arthritis. This condition can progress over months or years causing severe joint damage. Arthritis mutilans has also been called chronic absorptive arthritis, and may be seen in rheumatoid arthritis as well. * Spondyloarthritis (): This type is characterized by stiffness of the neck or the sacroiliac joint of the spine, but can also affect the hands and feet, in a similar fashion to symmetric arthritis. * Distal interphalangeal predominant (): This type of psoriatic arthritis is found in about 5% of patients, and is characterized by inflammation and stiffness in the joints nearest to the ends of the fingers and toes. Nail changes are often marked.  Treatments  The underlying process in psoriatic arthritis is inflammation; therefore, treatments are directed at reducing and controlling inflammation. Milder cases of psoriatic arthritis may be treated with NSAIDs alone; however, there is a trend toward earlier use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biological response modifiers to prevent irreversible joint destruction. = Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs = Typically the medications first prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, followed by more potent NSAIDs like diclofenac, indomethacin, and etodolac. NSAIDs can irritate the stomach and intestine, and long-term use can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors) e.g. Celecoxib or Etoricoxib, are associated with a statistically significant 50 to 66% relative risk reduction in gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding complications compared to traditional NSAIDs, but carry an increased rate of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack, and stroke. Both COX-2 inhibitors and other non-selective NSAIDS have potential adverse effects that include damage to the kidneys. = Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs = These are used in persistent symptomatic cases without exacerbation. Rather than just reducing pain and inflammation, this class of drugs helps limit the amount of joint damage that occurs in psoriatic arthritis. Most DMARDs act slowly and may take weeks or even months to take full effect. Drugs such as methotrexate or leflunomide are commonly prescribed; other DMARDS used to treat psoriatic arthritis include cyclosporin, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine. According to a recent Cochrane review, low dose oral methotrexate was slightly more effective than placebos. Immunosuppressant drugs can also reduce psoriasis skin symptoms but can lead to liver and kidney problems and an increased risk of serious infection. = Biological response modifiers = The most recent class of treatment is called biological response modifiers or biologics has been developed using recombinant DNA technology. Biologic medications are derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. Unlike traditional DMARDS that affect the entire immune system, biologics target specific parts of the immune system. They are given by injection or intravenous (IV) infusion. Biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are TNF-Œ± inhibitors, including infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and adalimumab, as well as the IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor ustekinumab. Recently, the Jak inhibitor, tocifitinib (Xeljanz), was approved for the use in active psoriatic arthritis.Rheumatology (Oxford). 2019 Jan 1;58(1):e2. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/key333 Biologics may increase the risk of minor and serious infections. More rarely, they may be associated with nervous system disorders, blood disorders or certain types of cancer. = Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors = A first-in-class treatment option for the management of psoriatic arthritis, apremilast is a small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for use by the FDA in 2014. By inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme which breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP levels rise, resulting in the down-regulation of various pro-inflammatory factors including TNF-Œ±, interleukin 17 and interleukin 23, as well as the up-regulation of anti- inflammatory factor interleukin 10. It is given in tablet form and taken by mouth. Side effects include headaches, back pain, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections, as well as depression and weight loss. Patented in 2014 and manufactured by Celgene, there is no current generic equivalent available on the market. = Other treatments = A review found tentative evidence of benefit of low level laser therapy and concluded that it could be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated RA. Retinoid etretinate is effective for both arthritis and skin lesions. Photochemotherapy with methoxy psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) are used for severe skin lesions. Doctors may use joint injections with corticosteroids in cases where one joint is severely affected. In psoriatic arthritis patients with severe joint damage orthopedic surgery may be implemented to correct joint destruction, usually with the use of a joint replacement. Surgery is effective for pain alleviation, correcting joint disfigurement, and reinforcing joint usefulness and strength.  Epidemiology  Seventy percent of people who develop psoriatic arthritis first show signs of psoriasis on the skin, 15 percent develop skin psoriasis and arthritis at the same time, and 15 percent develop skin psoriasis following the onset of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis can develop in people who have any level severity of psoriatic skin disease, ranging from mild to very severe.Who's At Risk, Be Joint Smart (a coalition of the National Psoriasis Foundation and the Arthritis Foundation). Accessed 2016-11-12. Psoriatic arthritis tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of psoriasis. For the majority of people, this is between the ages of 30 and 55, but the disease can also affect children. The onset of psoriatic arthritis symptoms before symptoms of skin psoriasis is more common in children than adults. More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterized by nail pitting, separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed, ridging and cracking, or more extremely, loss of the nail itself (onycholysis). Enthesitis is observed in 30 to 50% of patients and most commonly involves the plantar fascia and Achilles‚Äô tendon, but it may cause pain around the patella, iliac crest, epicondyles, and supraspinatus insertions Men and women are equally affected by this condition. Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is more common among Caucasians than African or Asian people.

Ylivieska is a town and municipality of Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland. It has a population of (), and it serves as the administrative centre for Kalajokilaakso and Pyh√§jokilaakso, an area with about 90,000 inhabitants. Ylivieska is also the commercial center of the Oulu South region, the southern part of the late Oulu province. The closest cities near Ylivieska are Oulu (), Vaasa () and Kokkola (), the neighbouring municipalities are Oulainen, Haapavesi, Nivala, Sievi, Kalajoki, Alavieska and Merij√§rvi. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.  Geography  Ylivieska is located in Northern Ostrobothnia about south of the city of Oulu. The town is characterized by the Kalajoki River, which runs SE‚ÄìNW through the town centre. The agricultural and economical area of the Kalajoki river basin is known as Kalajokilaakso. Ylivieska is situated along the Ostrobothnia railway, which leads from Helsinki, the national capital, to Rovaniemi in the north of the country. The railway was opened in 1886 and it has had a significant role in the town's economical development.  Economy  Employment by industry (2005) * Services 66.1% * Industry 28.5% * Agriculture and forestry 5.4% * Unemployment 11% Agriculture and animal husbandry, mainly milking cows, used to be the main sources of livelihood in Ylivieska. In recent decades, the role of agriculture has reduced following the development of industry and services. Currently, Ylivieska is home to about 30 industrial enterprises, some of which are also internationally recognized in their respective niche markets. Regionally, Ylivieska has become an important place for car buyers. There are several stores and agents selling new and used cars, and purchases average about 6,000 cars per year. Thus, the local car sales entrepreneurs have created the concept of Ylivieska being the \\"Autolaakso\\" or \\"car valley\\" of the Kalajokilaakso and neighbouring regions.

St Ives Chase is a separate suburb, to the north. History The St Ives area was first explored by Governor Arthur Phillip and a party of men in 1788 where they set up a campsite at Bungaroo which is close to what is now Hunter Avenue. The area produced a small scale timber felling industry. There are still some examples of the thirty metre and higher trees in nearby Pymble in the Dalrymple Hay forest and near Canisius College. Native turpentine trees were also once abundant and provided useful timber for cabinet making. It was once known for its apple orchards but due to residential demand, there is no longer any commercial fruit growing in the area.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, p.237 During the Second World War there were significant numbers of troops barracked in the area, which provided the impetus to build Archbold Road as a supplementary and emergency route to the city. Since 1950 the suburb has expanded from the central shopping areas and the arterial main roads to include hilltop and valley areas bordering on the surrounding Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park to the north, now the area known as St Ives Chase, and Garigal National Park to the east and the south east. St Ives Post Office opened on 10 November 1885 and the first public school opened on 6 May 1889. The school was formally opened by Mr. J. P. Burns, M.L.A. on Saturday 8 June. After inspecting the \\"neat and well-designed school and teacher's residence\\" the party had a luncheon to mark the occasion. St Ives was initially slow to develop due to the perceived remoteness from the city. Settlement increased in the late 1890s, when St Ives was populated by market gardeners, a small dairy, orchard workers and related industries. The suburb since the end of the Second World War has seen its most rapid period of expansion and a steady growth in families moving to the area. Commercial area St Ives Shopping Village is a medium-sized shopping centre opened in the 1960s. The centre has over 110 stores, its main tenants are Harris Farm Markets, Coles SupermarketsColes and Woolworths. Village Green is a popular park in St Ives.

Before 1 January 2020, the region was divided in two counties, Vest-Agder and Aust- Agder.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/kommunesammenslaaing/dette-er-norges- nye-regioner/a/23931222/ Since the early 1900s, the term S√∏rlandet (\\"south country\\") has been commonly used for this region, sometimes with the inclusion of neighbouring Rogaland. Before that, the area was considered a part of Western Norway. The area was a medieval petty kingdom, and after Norway's unification became known as Egdafylki and later Agdesiden, a county within the kingdom of Norway. The name Agder was not used after 1662, when the area was split into smaller governmental units called Neden√¶s, R√•byggelaget, Lister, and Mandal. The name was resurrected in 1919 when two counties of Norway that roughly corresponded to the old Agdesiden county were renamed Aust-Agder (East Agder) and Vest-Agder (West Agder). Even before the two counties joined in 2020, they cooperated in many ways; the University of Agder had sites in both Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder, as did many other institutions, such as the Diocese of Agder og Telemark, the Agder Court of Appeal, and the Agder Police District. Name The name Agder is older than the Norwegian language. Its meaning is not known. Just as the Norwegian language derives from Old Norse, Agder derives from the Old Norse word Ag√∞ir. In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Ag√∞ir was a petty kingdom inhabited by a people named after it, the Eg√∞ir. Nothing in Old Norse gives any hint as to the word's meaning; it was not produced (from known segments) in Old Norse, which means the name is older still. The Eg√∞ir are believed to be the same etymologically as the Augandzi people mentioned in the Getica of Jordanes, who wrote of Scandza (Scandinavia) in the 6th century. If Jordanes's Scandza is a palatalized form of *Scandia, then Augandzi is likely a palatalized form of *Augandii, residents of *Augandia. A name of that period would have to be closer to Proto-Germanic; in fact, a word of that period does present itself and fits the geographical lore of the times: *agwj≈ç (meaning \\"island\\"), which Jordanes and all his predecessors writing of Scandinavia believed it to be. A simple metathesis produces a possibly late form, *augjo-, but this derivation is speculative. There is no other evidence on Auganza, and its connection to Egder is hypothetical too. = Municipalities = Agder has 25 municipalities.List of Norwegian municipality numbers { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" !

These circumstances produced the generally turbulent and heroic lives recorded in the Heimskringla. For example, the Ynglinga saga tells us that Harald Redbeard, chief of Ag√∞ir, refused his daughter √Ösa to Gudr√∂d Halvdanson, on which event Gudr√∂d invaded Ag√∞ir, killed Harald and his son Gyrd, and took √Ösa whether she would or no. She bore a son, Halvdan (the Black), obviously named after his deceased grandfather, and later arranged to have Gudr√∂d assassinated. Among the royal families these events seem to have been rather ordinary. Her word was the last in the argument, as her grandson, Harald Fairhair, unified Norway. =Kings of Agder= Legendary Kings * Harald Agderking * V√≠kar * Kissa * King Bj√¶ring Monarchs of Agder: 790-987 * Harald Granraude, 7??-815, father of √Ösa * √Ösa, between 815 and 834-838, mother of Halfdan the Black * Halfdan the Black, father of Harald Fairhair, from 838 * Kjotve the Rich, late 9th century * Harald Gudr√∏dsson Grenske, 976-987 Prior to the Viking Age is a gap in the history of the region for a few hundred years, but in Jordanes we also find regions of the same but earlier forms of names, presumably also petty kingdoms under now unknown chiefs. The previous most credible source, Ptolemy, gives the briefest of sketches, only citing all of Norway as the Chaedini (\\"country people\\"). Perhaps the difference between kingdoms were not sufficiently important to cite them individually. Prior to then the most credible and respected source, Tacitus in Germania Chapter 44 described the Suiones, who were divided into civitates (kingdoms?) along the coast of Scandinavia and were unusual in owning fleets of a special type of ship. These were pointed on both ends and were driven by banks of oars that could be rearranged or shipped for river passage. They did not depend on sail (so Tacitus says) but other than that they do not differ from Viking ships. These civitates went all the way around Scandinavia to the Arctic, or at least to regions of very long days, where they stopped. It seems clear that in the Roman Iron Age Norway was populated by people of the same identity as Sweden, who were called the Suiones by Latin sources. In settling the coast at some point in prehistory they had been divided into civitates by the terrain. These states took on mainly geographical names or names of individuals or mythological characters. Agder was one of them. After the unification of Norway by Harold Fairhair and army and allies in the 10th century, all the civitates became provinces (fylker) and after their conversion to Christianity they became dioceses or parishes. The development of Old Norse into local dialects and the dissimilation of customs due to isolation added an ethnic flavor to the area, which is cherished today.

It was visited by the Giotto probe in July 1992. The spacecraft came as close as 200 km, but could not take pictures because some instruments were damaged from its encounter with Halley's Comet. The comet was discovered in 1902 by John Grigg of New Zealand, and rediscovered in its next appearance in 1922 by John Francis Skjellerup, an Australian then living and working for about two decades in South Africa where he was a founder member of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa. In 1987, it was belatedly discovered by ƒΩubor Kres√°k that the comet had been observed in 1808 as well, by Jean-Louis Pons. The comet has often suffered the gravitational influence of Jupiter, which has altered its orbit considerably. For instance, its perihelion distance has changed from 0.77 AU in 1725 to 0.89 AU in 1922 to 0.99 AU in 1977 and to 1.12 AU in 1999. Having its recent perihelion so close to Earth's orbit made it an easy target to reach for the Giotto mission (spacecraft) in 1992, whose primary mission was to Comet Halley. Giotto had a closest approach to Grigg‚ÄìSkjellerup of 200 km, much closer than its approach to Comet Halley, but was unable to obtain images as its camera was destroyed during the Halley rendezvous in 1986. In 1972 the comet was discovered to produce a meteor shower, the Pi Puppids, and its current orbit makes them peak around April 23, for observers in the southern hemisphere, best seen when the comet is near perihelion. The 2002 return (expected perihelion around October 8, 2002) was very unfavorable and no observations were reported. The comet nucleus is estimated to be 2.6 kilometers in diameter. The comet is a type locality for the mineral brownleeite.

Dunedoo is well known to Australian travellers due to its distinctive name (Dunny is a colloquial Australian word for a toilet). The name is actually derived from a local Aboriginal word meaning \\"swan\\", which are commonly found in the area's lagoons. The town is located on the north-western edges of the Sydney basin.http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/data/assets/image/0007/96847/20758.gif Geography and features Dunedoo is located above sea-level on the southern bank of the Talbragar River at the intersection of the Golden and Castlereagh Highways. It is a relatively isolated township with the two nearest rural centres of Mudgee and Dubbo situated approximately to the south and west respectively. It is due to this isolation that Dunedoo has many facilities not usually found in villages of this size. Dunedoo largely functions as a service centre to the surrounding district which focuses on the production of wheat, cattle, mixed farming, timber, lambs and wool. As with many wheat-growing centres of western New South Wales the village's skyline is dominated by a large silo with winx on it. Dunedoo also features a hospital (Dunedoo War Memorial Hospital), two schools (a government administered combined primary and high school and a catholic primary school), a licensed hotel, a small commercial area, a small freight railway station as well as sporting and special event facilities. Dunedoo also features Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches. History Before European settlement Dunedoo and the surrounding area was occupied by the Gamilaroi and Wiradjuri peoples. Allan Cunningham was the first British explorer to discover the area in 1823 while travelling Pandoras Pass over the Warrumbungle ranges to the Liverpool Plains. Surveyors studied the area in 1832 followed by squatters who settled the region. The town was founded somewhere in the 1840s and was originally known as Bolaro and later as Redbank. Dunedoo remained a small village throughout the 19th century and the nearby town of Cobbora was considered to be the regional centre for many years. However, Dunedoo's population grew substantially after the construction of the Gwabegar railway line and the opening of passenger services in 1910. Bolaro Post Office opened on 1 November 1876 and was renamed Dunedoo in 1909. The first half of the 20th century saw many of Dunedoo's residents fighting in both the first and second world wars, documented by the war memorial currently found in the town's park. The gradual loss of railway services in western NSW affected Dunedoo in the 1960s with the loss of passenger railway services, however freight trains still commonly use the line. Other services, such as the village's cinema, have also been lost over time. In 2002, Dunedoo appeared in an ABC documentary entitled \\"A Loo with a View\\".A Loo with a View documentary page at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Dunedoo is currently suffering the fate of many small regional towns of NSW in that its population is gradually decreasing. Many locals fear that the town will eventually be deserted and thus many creative ideas have been floated as possible methods of reversing the current trend. The Dunedoo District Development Group had proposed to build \\"The Big Dunny\\" in the hope of attracting tourists, as the Big Banana does for Coffs Harbour and big things in other parts of Australia. The documentary centred on \\"The Big Dunny\\" proposal, it was to have been a three-storey high building featuring five-star toilets, visitor centre, viewing platform, and even a radio station. Local shire councillor and farmer Frank Gaden was against it, reckoning it would be an embarrassment. Feasibility consultant Ian Farlow concluded it would, unfortunately, attract only 30 visitors a day which would not be enough to make it worthwhile, and proposed instead an environmentally friendly self- composting toilet block. The council decided against the latter and in the end nothing was built. 2005 saw the town incorporated into the newly created Warrumbungle Shire, formed from the previous Coolah and Coonabarabran Shires. The town was briefly divided over the prospect of joining Coonabarabran Shire with many preferring the town be incorporated into the Mudgee-based Mid- Western Regional Council. Heritage listings Dunedoo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Wallerawang-Gwabegar railway: Dunedoo railway station Population In the 2016 Census, there were 747 people in Dunedoo. 84.8% of people were born in Australia and 91.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 38.1%, Catholic 24.8%, No Religion 18.2%. Climate Dunedoo's climate is on the drier end of a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Sport and culture Dunedoo features many sporting facilities including Robertson Oval (used for rugby league and netball). The Dunedoo Sports club has a 9-hole golf course and four grass tennis courts, as well as two squash courts. Touch football is also played there during the summer months on part of the golf course close to the club building. Dunedoo also has a lawn bowls club. Competitions are held regularly in each of these sports within the town. Dunedoo Swans rugby league team play in the Castlereagh Cup rugby league and produced former St George and NSW centre Brian Johnston. Their uniform features the colours green and white. Between 1957 and 1959, the Dunedoo Car Club held four motor racing meetings on a course located on the \\"Wargundy\\" property approximately 10 kilometres south-east of the town. The circuit was less than a mile in length, and originally was dirt with oil bonded into the surface, although later the Club paved several corners, with the intention of paving the whole circuit in the future. Unfortunately for the Club, as the circuit was in private property, it was not covered by any lease, and existed purely on the goodwill of the owner of \\"Wargundy\\". The owner withdrew the goodwill in 1959, and the circuit closed down. Dunedoo is host to many festivals including the Dunedoo Bush Poetry Festival held annually in April by the Dunedoo District Development Group. The Dunedoo Show is held each February featuring carnival rides and several rodeo-themed events including whip-cracking and bull riding. The town also holds annual ANZAC Day marches and Christmas parades in the main street. Dunedoo has a community radio station, Three Rivers Radio. It broadcasts continuously on a frequency of 96.1 MHz. Programs include Sport, Good Music Cafe, Jazz, Great Musicals, Hymns, Chatter Box (Dunedoo Central School on air each week), St Michaels School alternate weeks, Good music all the time including Frank Bourke's old time orchestra each week.

It is the first UNIX 95 to not be derived from the AT&T; source code. Through integration with the rest of z/OS, additional Time Sharing Option (TSO) commands are available alongside the usual UNIX services, making it possible to process UNIX files using ISPF. Extensions in JCL make it possible to use these files in batch processing.  Overview  UNIX System Services allows UNIX applications from other platforms to run on IBM System z mainframes running z/OS. In many cases only a recompile is necessary, although additional effort may be advisable for z/OS integration (such as SMP/E installation support). While z/OS UNIX supports ASCII and Unicode, and there's no technical requirement to modify ASCII and Unicode UNIX applications, many z/OS users often prefer EBCDIC support in their applications including those running in z/OS UNIX. Consequently, z/OS UNIX provides application and administrator services for converting to/from EBCDIC. Programs running under z/OS UNIX have full, secure access to the other internal functions of z/OS. Database access (DB2 via Call Attach) is one example of how z/OS UNIX can access services found elsewhere in z/OS. Naturally such programs cannot be ported to non- mainframe platforms without rewriting if they use these z/OS-specific services. Conversely, if a program adheres to UNIX standards such as POSIX and ANSI C, it will be easier to move it between different UNIX operating systems including z/OS UNIX. The file systems for z/OS UNIX (the older HFS and the now preferred zFS), which support UNIX-style long filenames, appear as special VSAM datasets to the rest of z/OS. Numerous core z/OS subsystems and applications rely on UNIX System Services, including the z/OS Management Facility, XML parsing and generation services, OpenSSH, the IBM HTTP Server for z/OS, the z/OS SDK for Java, and some z/OS PKI services as examples. z/OS UNIX also provides a shell environment, OMVS. z/OS UNIX's predecessor was an operating system component called OpenEdition MVS, first implemented in MVS/ESA 4.3 and enhanced in MVS/ESA 5.1. OpenEdition MVS only supported the POSIX standards. IBM continues to enhance UNIX System Services. Typically every release of z/OS includes enhancements to z/OS UNIX.

The river rises on the western side of the Liverpool Range on south slopes of Great Dividing Range, north of Cassilis and flows generally south west, joined by fifteen tributaries, including the Coolaburragundy River, and reaching its confluence with the Macquarie River near Dubbo; descending over its course. The river flows through the Dunedoo and is noted for its influence on flood, particularly for its capacity for rapid rise and fall, due to the wide catchment, and the effect of its flood water on Dubbo. European history The Talbragar River was first encountered by Europeans in the late 1820s when it was called the Putterbatta River. The first bridge over the Talbragar was built in the 1850s, near Dunedoo, by Thomas New.

It opened to the public on 28 February 1977, to provide more living and breeding space for large animals such as elephants and antelopes which needed more space than was available at the restricted Sydney site. The zoo is run by the Taronga Conservation Society (formerly Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales), along with Taronga Zoo Sydney. Western Plains Zoo is located on the Newell Highway in west Dubbo about 5 km from the city. History In the late 1960s, plans to develop a large plains zoo to complement Sydney's Taronga Zoo were established. The new zoo would provide breeding facilities particularly suited to the large plains dwelling animals and to fulfil a need for an open range facility for the display of mainly grazing animals. After considerable planning and preparation, a site on the outskirts of Dubbo in central West New South Wales was chosen. Formerly an army camp during World War Two, the site was transformed into a 300 hectare zoo of woodland and irrigated grasslands. Western Plains Zoo opened to the public on 28 February 1977. When the zoo opened, it contained 35 different animals from six countries. The zoo is an open-range design, with walls and fences replaced by concealed moats which divide the animals from the visitors. This creates the impression of actually being with the animals in the wild. It was also the first zoo to be built in Australia in 60 years. Queen Elizabeth II visited the Western Plains Zoo in 1992. In 1994 Western Plains Zoo was awarded as the Best Major Tourist Attraction, the highest honour in Australian Tourism. On 26 September 2006, The Daily Liberal published an article announcing British comedian John Cleese was visiting the zoo \\"in order to raise money for a new Greater One-Horned rhino exhibit\\". =Name change= The zoo changed its name to Taronga Western Plains Zoo on 21 January 2009, citing the need to draw attention to the work of the Taronga Conservation Society Australia. =Zoo friends= Zoo Friends was an organisation which offered support in form of volunteers and fund raising for both Taronga Zoo Sydney and Western Plains Zoo.

With its line of automatic telephone exchanges, it was also a long-term supplier of switching equipment to the Bell System, starting in 1919. History In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was inspired by the idea of manufacturing automatic telephone exchanges that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the automatic telephone exchange. In 1901, with the construction of a new company manufacturing plant at Morgan and Van Buren Streets in West Chicago, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively. Automatic switches based on the Strowger system proliferated in independent telephone companies in the 1910s and 1920s, well before the Bell System started deployment of Panel switch technology in the early 1920s. In 1919, the Bell System was impacted considerably by organized operator strikes and the leadership abandoned its rejection of automatic switching equipment. As a result, Automatic Electric became a long-term supplier of step-by-step switching equipment to the Bell System for installations where the large-scale Panel system was not economical. General Telephone and Electronics (GT&E;) acquired Automatic Electric through a merger with Theodore Gary & Company in 1955, and continued operating the unit into the 1980s. Lenkurt, a manufacturer of carrier equipment, was purchased by GT&E; in 1959, and held separately from Automatic Electric. In 1983, GTE merged Automatic Electric and Lenkurt into GTE Network Systems, which was quickly renamed GTE Communication Systems when AT&T; announced the renaming of Western Electric as AT&T; Network Systems. In 1989, the assets of the company were placed into a joint venture between AT&T; and GTE called AG Communication Systems (the A and G respectively standing for the partners' names). At the same time, GTE Communications systems spun off their interconnect business to a joint venture called Fujitsu GTE, later to be renamed as Fujitsu Business Communication Systems, Inc. AG Communication Systems ceased separate existence in 2004, and became fully incorporated into Lucent, subsequently Alcatel-Lucent. Alcatel-Lucent also owned many of the assets of the Western Electric Company, Automatic Electric's former rival and Bell System counterpart. Facilities With the corporate establishment of the Automatic Electric Company in 1901, the facilities of the Automatic Electric Company were located in a six-story complex erected at the intersection of Morgan Street and Van Buren Street in the western part of Chicago.Telephony, 4 December 1909, p. 583 In 1957, Automatic Electric was relocated to Northlake, Illinois, and maintained research and development facilities in Melrose Park and Elmhurst, Illinois. AE acquired a manufacturing facility in Genoa, Illinois, from Leich Electric, and, in 1978, opened a research and development branch in Phoenix, Arizona. In the mid-1960s, a manufacturing plant was built in Huntsville, Alabama. Public coin-operated telephones and the Styleline series of consumer telephones were manufactured there. A smaller rental telephone refurbishment operation was also moved to the Huntsville plant in the 1970s. The plant was closed in the mid-1980s as domestic labour and production costs rose sharply against overseas competitors.GTE to close out Huntsville operation In Canada, Automatic Electric acquired Phillips Electric Works, a cable factory in Brockville, Ontario, in 1930. Telephones were manufactured at that facility from 1935 to 1953, when Automatic Electric sold the cable plant and built a 33-acre, $1.5 million telephone factory at 100 Strowger Boulevard. The Strowger Boulevard factory was sold to BC Tel (as Microtel) in 1979, then was owned by Nortel (as Brock Telecom) from 1990 to 1999; it closed in 2002. The Phillips Cables factory closed in the 1990s and was later demolished. In England, the Automatic Telephone and Electric Co. Ltd. operated a manufacturing plant in Liverpool. British Insulated Cables had founded Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company in November 1911 to manufacture the Strowger system under licence from the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago. The first maker of automatic exchanges in the UK, this company (as of 1923) was one of four which manufactured equipment for Post Office-owned central offices. It became part of International Automatic Telephone Co. in 1920, which changed name to Automatic Electric Co. in 1932 and then to Automatic Telephone and Electric Co. in 1936 to reflect a product range which included sidelines ranging from Xcel heating appliances to traffic signals.Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Co history In the 1950s, two Automatic Electric factories were manufacturing in Europe: Automatique Electric SA of Antwerp, Belgium and Autelco Mediterranea SATAP of Milan, Italy. Products Illinois Tunnel Company in Chicago was one of the largest early users of Automatic Electric equipment. As its principal product line, Automatic Electric manufactured automatic stepping switches (specifically, \\"Strowger switches\\") which had enabled Strowger's vision. These switches allowed customers to connect their own calls without operator assistance. Automatic Electric's rotary dial makes a single clicking sound as it is released but is otherwise fairly silent, while Western Electric's rotary dial has a distinctive whirring sound as the dial returns to the normal position. Many AE telephones use a distinctive dual-gong ringer, the low and high tones of which are a musical minor fifth apart, rather than the typical natural third interval of most Western Electric ringers. The GTD-5 EAX, GTE Automatic Electric's digital class 4/5 central office telephone switch, was first deployed on June 26, 1982.

Portrayed by Christopher Judge, Teal'c is a Jaffa warrior from the planet Chulak. As a Jaffa, Teal'c is a genetically modified human with an abdominal pouch that serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity; Teal'c is around 100 years old during the show's run and ages an additional 50 years in the final SG-1 episode. Teal'c's most notable feature is a golden tattoo found on his forehead, a sign that he once served the System Lord Apophis as First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank. Teal'c is introduced in the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1, \\"Children of the Gods\\". The character appears in all episodes of SG-1 except season 8's \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", making him the character with the most episode appearances. Teal'c also appears in the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum, as well as the Stargate Atlantis season 4 episodes \\"Reunion\\" and \\"Midway\\". In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series\\". Role in Stargate =Character arc= Teal'c is a Jaffa from the planet Chulak. In the decades before the events of Stargate SG-1, the Goa'uld System Lord Cronus executed Teal'c's father (Cronus' First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank) for retreating during a battle that could not be won. In the hopes of avenging his father's death one day, Teal'c joined the armies of the rival System Lord Apophis. Under the direction of Apophis' then-First Prime, Bra'tac, Teal'c learned the ways of a warrior and rose in the ranks to become Apophis's new First Prime. His interaction with Bra'tac and his own personal experiences eventually led Teal'c to doubt the divinity of the Goa'uld. When the SG-1 team is captured on Chulak in the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1, Teal'c defects from Apophis and joins the SG-1 team. He believes this will provide an opportunity eventually to defeat the Goa'uld and bring freedom to all Jaffa.\\"Children of the Gods\\" Teal'c finds a home at Stargate Command (SGC) on Earth and occasionally visits his wife Drey'auc and his young son Rya'c on Chulak (see section Relationships). SG-1 joins forces with Bra'tac in many missions against Apophis in the next four seasons. Teal'c's integrity in the team is tested after he kills Daniel's wife Sha're in season 3's \\"Forever in a Day\\" to stop her torturing Daniel. After SG-1 succeeds in killing Apophis in the season 5 premiere, \\"Enemies\\", Chulak becomes a free planet. The first major group of Jaffa Resistance warriors is shown in season 5's \\"The Warrior\\". By season six, Teal'c and Bra'tac have become prominent leaders of the Jaffa Resistance. Earth's Alpha site serves as a main site of operation for the Rebel Jaffa and later the Tok'ra, but the two races have difficulty with trust and collaboration in defeating the Goa'uld as their enemy.\\"Death Knell\\" Teal'c and Bra'tac lose their symbiotes after a sabotaged Rebel Jaffa summit in season 6's \\"The Changeling\\", but the Tok'ra drug Tretonin sustains them from then on. Tretonin eventually becomes instrumental in liberating Jaffa from physiological reliance on Goa'uld symbiotes. No longer presenting a security risk to Earth, Teal'c attempts to have a normal life and moves out of the SGC in season 8's \\"Affinity\\". However, Teal'c's alien behavior and a murder case make life difficult for him. Teal'c and Bra'tac eventually lead the Jaffa to victory over the Goa'uld in season 8's \\"Reckoning\\"/\\"Threads\\". The Goa'uld have long weakened one another by continuous civil war amongst the System Lords, and the Jaffa see the Goa'uld's inability to save themselves from the Replicators as proof that they are false Gods. The new Jaffa Nation immediately becomes a major power, inheriting part of the fleets of the System Lords. Teal'c and Bra'tac are knighted Bloodkin to all Jaffa, the highest honour that can be bestowed on any Jaffa. The planet Dakara serves as the nation's new capital, and Chulak becomes a major stronghold for the Free Jaffa Nation in season 9. Teal'c is chosen as a member of the new Jaffa High Council, but the nation is divided between the opposition progressives (including Teal'c and Bra'tac) with a vision of a representative democracy, and the ruling traditionalists who support the military oligarchy. Many of the councilors are the former leaders of the Jaffa Resistance, and initially resist the Ori religion after having worshiped false gods for too long. After the death of the traditionalist leader Gerak in season 9's \\"The Fourth Horseman\\", Teal'c supports Bra'tac as an interim leader before the nation adopts a constitution based on Earth representative democracies in \\"Stronghold\\". After the events of season 9's \\"Camelot\\", the Ori take control of Chulak. The Jaffa suffer greatly against the Ori forces, and Dakara is completely destroyed. The last Jaffa episode is season 10's \\"Talion\\", in which Teal'c kills the Jaffa leader of an Ori-devout group named Arkad. The fate of the Jaffa Nation and Teal'c's standing among the Jaffa remain unresolved at the end of the series. In the series finale, \\"Unending\\", Teal'c spends fifty years frozen in time on the Odyssey with the rest of SG-1 when Carter triggers a time dilation device to prevent them being destroyed by an Ori battlecruiser, but when she finds a way to escape and save the Odyssey that requires one person to go back to the moment before time froze, Teal'c volunteers as his Jaffa nature meant that aging fifty years wouldn't be as significant to him as it would be to his human colleagues. As a result, Teal'c is the only one who remembers what took place during the time dilation device, but he vowed to never share that information with others, and apart from having gained a white streak in his hair his physical potential remains relatively unaffected. Teal'c appears in the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum. He also appears in two episodes of Stargate Atlantis, set before the events of Continuum. In \\"Reunion\\", he wishes Colonel Carter farewell before she leaves to become the new leader of Atlantis. In \\"Midway\\", he comes to Atlantis at Carter's request to teach Satedan warrior Ronon Dex how to deal with IOA interviews. While there, they develop a friendly rivalry, culminating in an hour-long sparring match which ended in a draw. When the Wraith leave the Pegasus galaxy and set foot at the SGC, Teal'c and Ronon work together to stop the enemy. =Characterization= Teal'c is a Jaffa from the planet Chulak, a planet orbiting a binary star system. Jaffa have a human appearance but have an abdominal pouch which serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity. Teal'c states he is 101 years old in season 4's \\"The Light\\", and ages an additional 50 years in season 10's \\"Unending\\". But since the symbiote also replaces the Jaffa's immune system, its removal is known to cause a long and painful death. As a Jaffa, Teal'c does not require sleep, but must engage in a form of meditation called kel'no'reem in order to synchronize with his symbiote. However, he later had his symbiote removed and survived on a drug called tretonin. After this, he was weaker, could not perform kel'no'reem and needed sleep. Teal'c is a \\"stalwart alien with the unfathomable - and mostly silent - demeanor\\" and \\"the most straight-faced member of SG-1\\". Teal'c's catchphrase is \\"Indeed\\". Christopher Judge described Teal'c as a liberator who tries to end his people's enslavement. Although Teal'c has certain advanced physical abilities and powers, he is very much human in his heart and in his mind. Judge also described Teal'c as a \\"rebel in a society that doesn't tolerate rebels\\". Teal'c is all about honor. By season 7, Teal'c has become more vocal about expressing his feelings towards situations and other characters. Teal'c became more accustomed to life on Earth, developed a taste for doughnuts and has gone on fishing trips with O'Neill, though he is puzzled as to why O'Neill fishes in a lake known to be devoid of fish. His favorite movie is Star Wars; he has seen it 9 times as of the season 5 episode Ascension. He once stated a dislike for \\"bovine lactose\\",Season 6, Episode 19 \\"The Changeling which may be due to an earlier episode (\\"Unnatural Selection\\"), in which Teal'c is seen gorging himself on ice cream and even stealing O'Neill's pint of ice cream from his hand when the Asgard beamed the refrigerated stores onto the Prometheus, implying that Teal'c may be lactose intolerant. In season 8, Judge wanted to take Teal'c one step closer to being more aware of Earth customs with a more Earth-like behavior, without him losing his alien perspective. He considered the first half of season 8 \\"the most my character has been given to do since we first started work on the series\\". =Relationships= At the beginning of the series, Teal'c is married to Drey'auc and has a son, Rya'c. When Teal'c defects to Earth, he leaves them behind on his homeworld, Chulak. Teal'c briefly reunites with his family in season 1's \\"Bloodlines\\" and season 2's \\"Family\\" to prevent Goa'uld influence on their life. Drey'auc marries Teal'c's childhood friend, Frotak, but Rya'c and Drey'auc leave Chulak to live in the Land of Light (from season 1's \\"The Broca Divide\\") soon after Frotak's death in \\"Family\\". Teal'c rekindles his feelings with a Tuk'ac temple priestess named Shau'nac in season 4's \\"Crossroads\\", but she is murdered soon thereafter. Drey'auc dies in a rebel Jaffa camp in season 6's \\"Redemption\\" after refusing a new larval symbiote. Teal'c begins a relationship with the Hak'tyl leader Ishta in season 7's \\"Birthright\\". He continues this relationship until at least season 8's \\"Sacrifices\\", where Rya'c also marries Kar'yn, a student of Ishta. Teal'c would also have a brief relationship with his neighbor, Krista. O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general except of Teal'c. At the beginning of the series, Hammond does not accept Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. General Landry also respects Teal'c as a warrior. The writers at first wanted to establish animosity between Teal'c and Daniel, particularly since Teal'c is indirectly responsible for the abduction of Daniel's wife Sha're, who was subsequent selected as a host for the Goa'uld Amaunet by Teal'c's then-master Apophis. \\"Forever in a Day\\" almost tries to flesh out this animosity. Judge and Michael Shanks, in real life best friends, protested, as they thought that Daniel would be fascinated by Teal'c's background, and Teal'c would be quite respectful to humans who have similar nobility despite behaving in a different manner. The producers eventually allowed the actors to show how much their characters care about and respect each other, although the characters may not get on with one another. For most of the run of SG-1, Teal'c is the only SG-1 member who is not from Earth. With the introduction of the human alien Jonas Quinn in season 6, the writers developed a relationship between the two aliens of the team \\"without making it seem exclusionary\\", and Teal'c is no longer the \\"Other\\" of the show. Teal'c and Jonas end up bonding because they have similar backgrounds. Christopher Judge explained that his character's amusement with Vala in seasons 9 and 10 contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. When Cameron Mitchell is introduced in season 9, Teal'c first reacts taken aback to Mitchell's enthusiasm, being more used to O'Neill's reserved attitude. Teal'c is unsure if he likes Mitchell at first, but Mitchell forces Teal'c to interact with him. By not letting Teal'c step back and observe, Mitchell makes Teal'c an active part of the scene. Teal'c and Mitchell are both warriors and leaders, but as Teal'c was established as a powerful warrior, the producers eventually established that Mitchell gets beat up all the time in fights. Conceptual history Christopher Judge had worked with Richard Dean Anderson before. Judge starred in a fifth season episode of MacGyver in 1990, where he played a high school student whom MacGyver tries to mentor and motivate despite negative influences. When the producers conceptualized Teal'c, they were unsure what they wanted, but had not met anyone who was definitely Teal'c for them. They were looking for African-American actors, and Judge was one of the last actors to read for the role. Judge was hired because the producers liked what he brought into the audition. They were receptive to Judge's input and gave him the freedom to change his lines from the beginning. Judge sat down with the producers at the beginning of each season and discussed what Teal'c should go through and what would slowly make him more human. During the first season, Teal'c seemed less well-integrated into the team than for instance O'Neill and Daniel. He was the only character who did not benefit as much from the more personal stories in season 3 and seemed to stagnate. Rumors began to surface at the end of season 3 that Judge would leave the show, but they were quickly and firmly denied. The last episodes of season 3 featured Teal'c in a more prominent role, and he benefited from additional screen time and storylines in season 4. Judge received his first story credit for the season 5 episode \\"The Warrior\\", and later wrote \\"The Changeling\\" on his own, focusing on Teal'c's self-identity. He later penned the season 7 episode \\"Birthright\\" and the season 8 episode \\"Sacrifices\\", both dealing with the Jaffa Hak'tyl faction and Teal'c's new love interest Ishta. =Make-up and hair= Since Teal'c wears a lot of make-up, Judge had to be on-set much earlier than the rest of the cast. The producers' original idea for Teal'c included long ears and a specific beard piece, but the make-up department got it down to just a forehead symbol, an Egyptian look, and the character's gold skin tone. The make-up was reflective of the Goa'uld Ra from the Stargate feature film. In the beginning of SG-1, Teal'c's forehead symbol consisted of three parts, and it took about an hour to apply the parts to Judge's forehead. The process was simplified over the years. The season 6 episodes \\"The Changeling\\" shows Teal'c experiencing an extended hallucination of being a human on Earth. For the filming of this episode, the eye make-up and the gold paint on the character was significantly toned down. With the beginning of season 7, when Teal'c no longer had a Goa'uld symbiote in his pouch, the gold make-up was dropped. Playing a bald-shaven head Teal'c for the first seven seasons, Judge usually let his hair grow during the show's hiatus, and shaved his head the morning of his first day back at work. For the season four premiere \\"Small Victories\\", he returned to the set with a small blond chin beard after the hiatus, as the producers had not allowed his character to have scalp hair at the time. Several episodes later, Judge shaved off the beard after acknowledging how it looked. With the beginning of season 8, after \\"many years of begging, pleading and politicking\\", Judge approached the producers again and asked for his character to have hair, and they gave in. Brad Wright was convinced that the audience would hate it. Judge showed the cornrows hairstyle that he thought Teal'c would have, at a convention, but the hair was cut short before the shooting of season 8 began. The story reasons for Teal'c's hair are never explained in the series, even despite Jack O'Neill making such an inquiry in \\"New Order\\", as he says, \\"What's with the hair?\\". Reception In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series\\".

It generally comprises four movements, typically a largo prelude followed by a fugal allegro, an expressive slow movement, and an allegro finale, although there are also many variations of this pattern.Grove Music Online: Sonata da chiesa, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.26196 During the 17th century, church services were increasingly accompanied by music for ensembles rather than solo organ, with canzonas and sonatas regularly substituted for the Proper during Mass and Vespers.Grove Music Online: Sonata da chiesa, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.26196 Many of these works, however, were not written explicitly as liturgical music and were often performed as concert pieces for entertainment. The term sonata da chiesa was originally used in its literal meaning of ‚Äúchurch music‚Äù but later came to be used figuratively to contrast this genre of composition with the sonata da camera, which literally meant ‚Äúchamber music‚Äù but generally comprised a suite of dances. Apel, Willi, with Thomas Binkley, ed., Italian Violin Music of the Seventeenth Century, p. 9, Indiana University Press, 1990 The exemplary works in this form are by Arcangelo Corelli whose Op. 1 (1681) and Op. 3 (1689) each consist of 12 trio sonatas with alternating slow-fast-slow-fast movements (the first 8 of the Concerti grossi, op.6 follow this pattern as well). This four movement scheme is followed in J. S. Bach's three sonatas for unaccompanied violin and in the first five sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord.Violin Sonatas (CD 19‚Äì20): \\"Liner notes\\" by Clemens Romijn p. 13, and \\"Full tracklist\\" pp. 155‚Äì56 in J. S. Bach Complete Edition: Liner notes, sung texts, full tracklist. Brilliant Classics, August 2014 (re-release). After 1700, composers tended to merge the sonata da cheisa with the sonata da camera. By the mid-18th century, however, this style of music was increasingly out of date, although Joseph Haydn, for example, did compose a few early symphonies that followed the largo‚Äìallegro‚Äìminuet‚Äìallegro pattern.See Haydn's Symphonies 5, 11, 21, 22, 34, 49 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also composed 17 works that are called seventeen \\"church sonatas\\", but these consisted of but a single movement for organ and strings to be played between the Epistle and the Gospel of the Mass.Zaslaw, Neal, with Cowdery, William eds., The Compleat Mozart: A Guide to the Musical Works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, p. 109-112, New York: W.W.

It was completed in Russian in 1897 but first published in English due to difficulties with the Russian censors.Simmons, Ernest (1973). What is Art?, in Tolstoy. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. p. 178. Tolstoy cites the time, effort, public funds, and public respect spent on art and artistsTolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). What is Art? (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky). London: Penguin. pp. 3‚Äì4. as well as the imprecision of general opinions on artTolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 9-13. as reason for writing the book. In his words, \\"it is difficult to say what is meant by art, and especially what is good, useful art, art for the sake of which we might condone such sacrifices as are being offered at its shrine\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 9. Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates an \\"unremitting moralism\\", evaluating artworks in light of his radical Christian ethics,Jahn 1975, p. 63. and displaying a willingness to dismiss accepted masters, including Wagner,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 101-12. Shakespeare,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 33-4, 137. and Dante,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95, 137. as well as the bulk of his own writings.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-198. Having rejected the use of beauty in definitions of art (see aesthetic theory), Tolstoy conceptualises art as anything that communicates emotion: \\"Art begins when a man, with the purpose of communicating to other people a feeling he once experienced, calls it up again within himself and expresses it by certain external signs\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 38. This view of art is inclusive: \\"jokes\\", \\"home decoration\\", and \\"church services\\" may all be considered art as long as they convey feeling.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41, Jahn 1975, p. 60. It is also amoral: \\"[f]eelings ‚Ä¶ very bad and very good, if only they infect the reader ‚Ä¶ constitute the subject of art\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 39. Tolstoy also notes that the \\"sincerity\\" of the artist‚Äîthat is, the extent to which the artist \\"experiences the feeling he conveys\\"‚Äîinfluences the infection.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 121, 93, 99-100.  Evaluating the content of art  While Tolstoy's basic conception of art is broadTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41. and amoral, his idea of \\"good\\" art is strict and moralistic, based on what he sees as the function of art in the development of humanity: > just as in the evolution of knowledge - that is, the forcing out and > supplanting of mistaken and unnecessary knowledge by truer and more > necessary knowledge - so the evolution of feelings takes place by means of > art, replacing lower feelings, less kind and less needed for the good of > humanity, by kinder feelings, more needed for that good. This is the purpose > of art.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 123-4.  Christian art  Tolstoy's analysis is influenced by his radical Christian views (see The Kingdom of God is Within You), views which led him to be excommunicated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901.Pevear, Richard (1995). \\"Preface\\" in Tolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). What is Art? (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky ed.). London: Penguin. p, xxii. . He states that Christian art, rooted in \\"the consciousness of sonship to God and the brotherhood of men\\":Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 130. > can evoke reverence for each man's dignity, for every animal‚Äôs life, it can > evoke the shame of luxury, of violence, of revenge, of using for one‚Äôs > pleasure objects that are a necessity for other people, it can make people > sacrifice themselves to serve others freely and joyfully, without noticing > it.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 166. Ultimately, \\"by calling up the feelings of brotherhood and love in people under imaginary conditions, religious art will accustom people to experiencing the same feelings in reality under the same conditions\\". Tolstoy's examples: Schiller's The Robbers, Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables, Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities and The Chimes, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Dostoevsky's The House of the Dead, George Eliot's Adam Bede,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 132. Ge's Judgement, Liezen-Mayer's Signing the Death Sentence, and paintings \\"portraying the labouring man with respect and love\\" such as those by Millet, Breton, Lhermitte, and Defregger.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 133. Universal art \\"Universal\\" art illustrates that people are \\"already united in the oneness of life's joys and sorrows\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 131. by communicating \\"feelings of the simplest, most everyday sort, accessible to all people without exception, such as the feelings of merriment, tenderness, cheerfulness, peacefulness, and so on\\". Tolstoy contrasts this ideal with art that is partisan in nature, whether it be by class, religion, nation, or style.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 134, 136, 152. Tolstoy's examples: he mentions, with many qualifiers, the works of Cervantes, Dickens, Moliere, Gogol, and Pushkin, comparing all of these unfavourably to the story of Joseph. In music he commends a violin aria of Bach, the E-flat major nocturne of Chopin, and \\"selected passages\\" from Schubert, Haydn, Chopin, and Mozart. He also speaks briefly of genre paintings and landscapes.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 135.  Evaluating style   Obscurity versus accessibility  Tolstoy notes the susceptibility of his contemporaries to the \\"charm of obscurity\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 63. Works have become laden with \\"euphemisms, mythological and historical allusions\\", and general \\"vagueness, mysteriousness, obscurity and inaccessibility to the masses\\". Tolstoy lambastes such works, insisting that art can and should be comprehensible to everyone. Having emphasised that art has a function in the improvement of humanity - capable of expressing man‚Äôs best sentiment - he finds it offensive that artists should be so wilfully and arrogantly abstruse.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 43, 47, 63-84, 123-4. Artificiality One criticism Tolstoy levels against art is that at some point it \\"ceased to be sincere and became artificial and cerebral\\",Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 59. leading to the creation of millions of works of technical brilliance but few of honourable sentiment.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 144. Tolstoy outlines four common markers of bad art: these are not however considered the canon or ultimate indicators # Borrowing # Imitation # Effectfulness # DiversionTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 84. = Borrowing = Involves recycling and concentrating elements from other works, typical examples of which are: \\"maidens, warriors, shepherds, hermits, angels, devils in all forms, moonlight, thunderstorms, mountains, the sea, precipices, flowers, long hair, lions, the lamb, the dove, the nightingale\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 85. = Imitation = Imitation is highly descriptive realism, where painting becomes photography, or a scene in a book becomes a listing of facial expressions, tone of voice, the setting, and so on.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 86. Any potential communication of feeling is \\"disrupted by the superfluity of details\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 88. =Effectfulness= Reliance on \\"strikingness\\", often involving contrasts of \\"horrible and tender, beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, dark and light\\", descriptions of lust, \\"crescendo and complication\\", unexpected changes in rhythm, tempo, etc.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 87. Tolstoy contends that works marked by such techniques \\"do not convey any feeling, but only affect the nerves\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 89. = Diversion = Diversion is \\"an intellectual interest added to the work of art\\", such as the melding of documentary and fiction, as well as the writing of novels, poetry, and music \\"in such a way that they must be puzzled out\\". All such works do not correspond with Tolstoy's view of art as the infection of others with feelings previously experienced,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 90. and his exhortation that art be \\"universal\\" in appeal.  The corruption of art   Causes  = Church Christianity and the Renaissance = Tolstoy approves of early Christian art for being inspired by love of Christ and man, as well as its antagonism to pleasure-seeking. He prefers this to the art born of \\"Church Christianity\\", which ostensibly evades the \\"essential theses of true Christianity\\" (that is, that all men are born of the Father, are equals, and should strive towards mutual love).Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 44. Art became pagan‚Äîworshipping religious figures‚Äîand subservient to the dictates of the Church. The corruption of art was deepened after the Crusades, as the abuse of papal power became more obvious. The rich began to doubt, seeing contradictions between the actions of the Church and the message of Christianity.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 45, 147. But instead of turning back to the early Christian teachings, the upper classes began to appreciate and commission art that was merely pleasing.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 46-8. This tendency was facilitated by the Renaissance, with the aggrandisement of ancient Greek art, philosophy, and culture which, Tolstoy alleges, is inclined to pleasure and beauty worship.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 46-50. = Aesthetic theory = Tolstoy perceives the roots of aesthetics in the Renaissance. Art for pleasure was validated in reference to the philosophy of the GreeksTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 50.Noyes, George (1918). Tolstoy. London: Duffield, p. 330. and the elevation of ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù as a legitimate criterion with which to separate good from bad art.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 53. Tolstoy moves to discredit aesthetics by reviewing and reducing previous theories - including those of Baumgarten,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 17, 30. Kant,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 20-1. Hegel,Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 23. and SchopenhauerTolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 24-5. \\\\- to two main ‚Äúaesthetic definitions of beauty‚Äù:Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 31. # The \\"objective\\" or \\"mystical\\" definition of beauty in which beauty is \\"something absolutely perfect which exists outside us\\",Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 32. whether it be associated with \\"idea, spirit, will, God\\" # The \\"subjective\\" definition of beauty, in which \\"beauty is a certain pleasure we experience, which does not have personal advantage as its aim\\". This definition tends to be more inclusive, enabling things like food and fabric to be called art Tolstoy then argues that, despite their apparent divergence, there is little substantive difference between the two strands. This is because both schools recognise beauty only by the pleasure it gives: \\"both notions of beauty come down to a certain sort of pleasure that we receive, meaning that we recognize as beauty that which pleases us without awakening our lust\\". Therefore, there is no objective definition of art in aesthetics.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33. Tolstoy condemns the focus on beauty/pleasure at length, calling aesthetics a discipline: > according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, > and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of > the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure - against which all > teachers of mankind have warned people - came to be regarded as the highest > art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the > empty amusement of idle people. = Professionalism = Tolstoy sees the developing professionalism of art as hampering the creation of good works. The professional artist can and must create to prosper, making for art that is insincere and most likely partisan - made to suit the whims of fashion or patrons.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 93-4. Art criticism is a symptom of the obscurity of art, for \\"[a]n artist, if he is a true artist, has in his work conveyed to others the feelings he has experienced: what is there to explain?\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 94. Criticism, moreover, tends to contribute to the veneration of \\"authorities\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95. such as Shakespeare and Dante.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 96. By constant unfavourable comparison, the young artist is corralled into imitating the works of the greats, as all of them are said to be true art. In short, new artists imitate the classics, setting their own feelings aside, which, according to Tolstoy, is contrary to the point of art.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 95-6, 121. Art schools teach people how to imitate the method of the masters, but they cannot teach the sincerity of emotion that is the propellant of great works.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 98. In Tolstoy's words, \\"[n]o school can call up feelings in a man, and still less can it teach a man what is the essence of art: the manifestation of feeling in his own particular fashion\\".  Consequences  # \\"[T]he enormous waste of working people's labour\\",Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 139. with individuals spending so much time contemplating and creating bad art that they become \\"incapable of anything that is really necessary for people\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 140. # The volume of art produced provides \\"the amusement which turns these people's eyes from the meaninglessness of their lives and saves them from the boredom that oppresses them\\", it enables them \\"to go on living without noticing the meaninglessness and cruelty of their life\\"Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 141. # The confusion and perversion of values. It becomes normal to worship not great religious figures but people who write incomprehensible poemsTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 143. # The worship of beauty legitimises the disregarding of morality as a criterion for evaluating cultural products # Modern art \\"direct corrupts people\\" by infecting them with feelings of superstition, patriotism, and sensualityTolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 145. Criticism of famous artists Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates a willingness to dismiss generally accepted masters, among them Liszt, Richard Strauss, Nietzsche, and Oscar Wilde. He also labels his own works as \\"bad art\\", excepting only the short stories \\"God Sees the Truth\\" and \\"Prisoner of the Caucasus\\".Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-8. He attempts to justify these conclusions by pointing to the ostensible chaos of previous aesthetic analysis. Theories usually involve selecting popular works and constructing principles from these examples. Volkelt, for instance, remarks that art cannot be judged on its moral content because then Romeo and Juliet would not be good art. Such retrospective justification cannot, he stresses, be the basis for theory, as people will tend to create subjective frameworks to justify their own tastes.Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33-4. Reception Jahn notes the \\"often confusing use of categorisation\\"Jahn 1975, p. 59. and the lack of definition of the key concept of emotion.Jahn 1975, pp. 61-2 Bayley writes that \\"the effectiveness of What is Art? lies not so much in its positive assertions as in its rejection of much that was taken for granted in the aesthetic theories of the time\\".Bayley, John (1986 [1966]).

It is the seventh-largest estuary in the United States, and the largest of seven major estuaries along the Texas Gulf Coast. It is connected to the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by sub-tropical marshes and prairies on the mainland. The water in the bay is a complex mixture of sea water and fresh water, which supports a wide variety of marine life. With a maximum depth of about and an average depth of only , it is unusually shallow for its size. The bay has played a significant role in the history of Texas. Galveston Island is home to the city of Galveston, the earliest major settlement in southeast Texas and the state's largest city toward the end of the nineteenth century. While a devastating hurricane in 1900 hastened Galveston's decline, the subsequent rise of Houston as a major trade center, facilitated by the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel across the western half of the bay, ensured the bay's continued economic importance. Today, Galveston Bay is encompassed by Greater Houston, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. The Port of Houston, which has facilities spread across the northwestern section of the bay, is the second-busiest port in the nation by overall tonnage. Other major ports utilizing the bay include the Port of Texas City and the Port of Galveston. With its diverse marine life, Galveston Bay also produces more seafood than any estuary in the United States except the Chesapeake. History The Gulf Coast gained its present configuration during the most recent glacial period approximately 18 ka (thousands of years ago). Low global sea levels allowed the Texas mainland to extend significantly farther south than it does presently, and the Trinity River had carved a deep canyon through present-day Bolivar Roads (the exit of the Houston Ship Channel) on its way to the coast. As the glacial period came to a close, rising sea levels initially filled this narrow canyon, followed by the broad lowlands of present-day Trinity Bay. Rapid sea level rise between 7.7 and 5.5 ka shifted the Gulf coastline northward to its contemporary latitude. This was quickly followed by the formation of Galveston Island (5.5 ka), a barrier island, and Bolivar Peninsula (2.5 ka), which began as a spit. Human settlement in what is now Texas began at least 10 ka following migrations into the Americas from Asia during the last ice age. The first substantial settlements in the area are believed to have been made by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes, who lived throughout the Gulf Coast region. Anonymous portrait claimed to be of Jean Lafitte in the early 19th century Though several Spanish expeditions charted the Gulf Coast, it was explorer Jos√© Antonio de Evia who in 1785 gave the bay and the island the name G√°lvezton in honor of Spanish viceroy Bernardo de G√°lvez. Louis Aury established a naval base at the harbor in 1816 to support the Mexican War of Independence. When he abandoned the base, it was then taken over by pirate Jean Lafitte, who temporarily transformed Galveston Island and the bay into a haven for outlaws before being ousted by the United States Navy. Following its independence from Spain, the new nation of Mexico claimed Texas as part of its territory. Settlements were established around the bay, including Galveston, Anahuac, Lynchburg, and San Jacinto. Following growing unrest, Texas revolted and gained independence in 1836 at the Battle of San Jacinto, near the bay along the San Jacinto River. The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly and joined the United States in 1845. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, residents of Galveston strongly supported secession and sided with the Confederacy as the Civil War broke out. However, separation from the Union did not last long; the city's harbor was blockaded by the federal navy starting in July 1861, followed by a full-scale occupation after the Battle of Galveston Harbor in October 1862. However, at the Battle of Galveston in January 1863, a small Confederate force managed to overwhelm the Union's naval forces in the bay and retake the island. Despite this victory, the Union continued to blockade the outlets of Galveston Bay until the end of the war. Reconstruction was swift in southeast Texas. Ranching interests were major economic drivers on the mainland in the 19th century. The city of Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center for shipping cotton, leather products, cattle, and other goods produced in the growing state. Railroads were built around the shore and new communities continued to emerge. Beach Hotel, a famous 19th century Galveston resort The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 devastated the city of Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. Growth moved inland to Houston, as fear of the risks posed by establishing businesses at Galveston limited the island's ability to compete. Texas City emerged as another important port in the area. Shipping traffic through the bay expanded dramatically after the federal government completed the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel to a depth of in 1914. The Texas oil boom began in 1901, and by 1915 oil production by the bay was fully underway. Oil wells and refineries quickly developed throughout the area. After frozen transport became available in the 1920s, commercial fishing developed as a substantial industry, producing particularly oysters, finfish, and, later, shrimp. By the end of the 1930s, the Port of Houston was the largest cotton port and third largest port by overall tonnage in the United States. NASA Johnson Space Center with Clear Lake visible at the top of the image The establishment of NASA's Johnson Space Center near the bay in the Clear Lake Area in 1963 brought new growth. By the 1970s Houston had become one the nation's largest cities, and its expansion connected it with the bay communities. The bay's shoreline became heavily urbanized and industrialized, leading to pollution of the bay. In the 1970s the bay was described by U.S. Representative Robert C. Eckhardt as \\"the most polluted body of water in the U.S.\\" The ship channel and Clear Lake were rated by the Galveston Bay Estuary Program as having even worse water quality. Extraction of oil and groundwater, as well as large wakes from increasing shipping in the bay, led to land subsidence and erosion along the shoreline, especially in the Baytown‚ÄìPasadena area.Henson (1993), p. 51. Over the past few decades, approximately of the historic San Jacinto battleground has been submerged; Sylvan Beach, a popular destination in La Porte, has been severely eroded, and the once prominent Brownwood neighborhood of Baytown has been abandoned. On February 23, 2019, Atlas Air Flight 3591 crashed into Trinity Bay, one of the bay's extensions, killing all three people on board. Today, the bay is a major destination for recreational and tourist activities, including boating, ecotourism, and waterfowl hunting. Features Trinity Bay (purple), East Bay (green), West Bay (orange) Galveston Bay covers approximately , and is long and wide. The bay has an average depth of and a maximum undredged depth of . The Galveston Bay system consists of four main bodies of water: Galveston Bay proper (upper and lower), Trinity Bay, East Bay, and West Bay. The bay is bordered by three counties: Chambers, Harris, and Galveston. Significant communities around the bay include Houston, Pasadena, League City, Baytown, Texas City, Galveston, La Porte, Seabrook, and Anahuac. Galveston Bay has three outlets to the Gulf of Mexico: Bolivar Roads between Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula, San Luis Pass at the west end of Galveston Island, and Rollover Pass across Bolivar Peninsula. Many smaller bays and lakes are connected to the main system, including Christmas Bay, Moses Lake, Dickinson Bay, Clear Lake, Ash Lake, Black Duck Bay, and San Jacinto Bay. Together with its extensions, Galveston Bay forms the largest of the seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, an inland waterway consisting of natural watercourses and man-made canals, runs between the bay and the Gulf. A majority of the bay's inflow comes from the Trinity River, which contributes of freshwater annually. The San Jacinto River contributes another . Local coastal watersheds contribute the remainder. =Climate= The climate around the Bay is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in K√∂ppen climate classification system). Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring heat from the deserts of Mexico and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Summer temperatures regularly exceed , and the area's humidity drives the heat index even higher. Winters in the area are mild, with typical January highs above and lows above . Snowfall is generally rare. Annual rainfall averages well over , with some areas typically receiving over . Hurricanes are an ever- present threat during the fall season. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are generally at the greatest risk. However, though the island and the peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge. Hurricane Ike, the most economically and environmentally destructive event on the bay since 1900, struck in 2008. A proposal to build a flood barrier system to prevent against future storm surge, the so-called Ike Dike, has been considered by the state government. In August 2017, the Galveston Bay Area was struck by Hurricane Harvey and received an extraordinary amount of rainfall in a matter of days, with many locations in the bay area observing more than of precipitation during the storm. Ecosystem This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources provides nursery and spawning grounds for many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish, thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. The deeper navigation channels of the bay provide suitable habitats for bottlenose dolphins, which feed on the abundant fish varieties. Additionally, the bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the bay support their own collection of ecosystems, containing diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The wetlands that surround the bay support a variety of fauna. Notable terrestrial species include the American alligator and the bobcat, while bird species include the roseate spoonbill, great and snowy egret, white-faced ibis, and mottled duck. =Pollution= City of Houston storm drains lead into Galveston Bay; messages ask people to keep the ecosystem in mind. In the early 1990s, the Houston Ship Channel had the fifth highest level of toxic chemicals in the nation due to industrial discharge, with over discharged between 1990 and 1994. However, the bay has generally experienced improving water quality since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. The Houston Area Research Council (HARC) and Galveston Bay Foundation periodically release the Galveston Bay Report Card, which grades a number of metrics indicative of the health of the bay's ecosystem and waters. The 2019 report assigned a \\"C\\" grade for toxins in bay sediments, citing water and soil pollution, wildlife habitat loss, and the impacts of climate change as challenges facing the estuary. The presence of the San Jacinto Pits Superfund site in the Houston Ship Channel, which contains large amounts of dioxin, is considered a significant threat to the bay's health. The entire bay is covered by seafood consumption advisories set by the Texas Department of State Health Services, but the strictness of these standards varies by location. In the Ship Channel, advisories recommend against the consumption of all fish and blue crab, while in the lower bay, advisories only apply to catfish. Oil spills are a routine consequence of the industrial activity around Galveston Bay, with hundreds of spills taking place in a typical year. On March 22, 2014, a barge carrying marine fuel oil collided with another ship in the Houston Ship Channel, causing the contents of one of the barge's tanks to leak into the bay, requiring weeks of cleanup by dozens of boats. Excessive ozone levels can occur due to industrial activities; nearby Houston is ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. The industries located along the ship channel are a major cause of ozone pollution.  Industry  Galveston Bay Area municipalities Galveston Bay is located in Greater Houston, which is the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States, and home to one of the nation's most significant shipping centers. Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, is the economic and cultural center of the region. Important ports served by the bay include the Port of Houston, the Port of Texas City, and the Port of Galveston. The Houston Ship Channel, which connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf, passes through the bay. It is a partially man-made feature created by dredging the Buffalo Bayou, the ship channel subbays, and Galveston Bay. The area has a broad industrial base including the energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, transportation, and health care sectors. The bayside communities in particular are home to the Johnson Space Center, which houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, Ellington Airport (home of the Houston Spaceport), and a high concentration of petrochemical refineries. Weisman (2008), pg. 166,\\"The industrial megaplex that begins on the east side of Houston and continues uninterrupted to the Gulf of Mexico, 50 miles away, is the largest concentration of petroleum refineries, petrochemical companies, and storage structures on Earth.\\" A large commercial fishing industry has grown around Galveston Bay, with significant production of shrimp, blue crab, eastern oyster, black drum, flounder, sheepshead, and snapper. In 2012, the commercial fish harvest in Galveston Bay amounted to , with a wholesale value of roughly $16.4 million. Galveston Bay supports a significant recreation and tourism industry, especially as a result of its proximity to major population centers. Over 40% of Greater Houston residents participate annually in hiking and swimming along the bay, while 20% go fishing and 15% go boating. The five counties surrounding the bay are home to 88,000 registered pleasure crafts. Fishing expenditures (such as the purchase of fishing bait or lodging) along Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake generate approximately $650 million annually. The recreational fishing industry supports over 3,000 jobs in the bay area. With over 600 species of birds, Galveston Bay is a popular destination for birdwatching. This sort of ecotourism generates millions in annual revenue for Chambers County, which is home to the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge and High Island.

During the war itself, Lane served as a United States Senator and as a general for the Union. Although reelected as a Senator during 1865, Lane committed suicide the next year. Early life The son of Amos Lane, Lane was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, where he practiced law when he was admitted to the state bar during 1840. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he successively commanded the 3rd and 5th Indiana Regiments. He was a U.S. congressman from Indiana (1853‚Äì1855) where he voted for the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. He relocated to the Kansas Territory during 1855. He immediately became involved with abolitionism in Kansas and was often termed the commander of the Free State Army (\\"The Red Legs\\" or Jayhawkers), a major Free Soil militant group. In 1855 he was the president of the convention that drafted the anti- slavery Topeka Constitution. On June 3, 1858, Lane shot and killed Gaius Jenkins in a land dispute in Lawrence. According to reports Jenkins was coming to get water from a well on the disputed property.https://territorialkansasonline.ku.edu/index.php?SCREEN=show_document&SCREEN;_FROM=immigration&document;_id=102878&FROM;_PAGE=&topic;_id=141 Jenkins was reported to have been displaying a revolver. Lane met him with a shotgun. One of the men with Jenkins shot Lane in the leg and Lane returned fire killing Jenkins.https://civilwaronthewesternborder.org/timeline/jim-lane- shoots-gaius-jenkins Lane was acquitted in the trial, which kept him from participating in the convention drafting of the Wyandotte Constitution, later the official constitution for Kansas.https://civilwaronthewesternborder.org/encyclopedia/wyandotte- constitution After the Free Soilers succeeded in getting Kansas admitted to the Union during 1861 as a free state, Lane was elected as one of the new state's first U.S. Senators, and reelected during 1865 Civil War During the American Civil War, in addition to his Senate service, Lane formed a brigade of \\"Jayhawkers\\" known as the \\"Kansas Brigade\\", or \\"Lane's Brigade\\", composed of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Kansas Volunteers. He commanded the force into action against pro-Southern General Sterling Price of Missouri in the Battle of Dry Wood Creek, as Price began an offensive early in the War to retake Missouri for the pro-Confederate state government that had been deposed by pro-Union forces around St. Louis. Lane lost the battle but stayed behind and attacked pro-South areas in Missouri behind Price. During the Battle of Hemp Bales, General John Charles Fremont ordered General Henry Lane to make a \\"demonstration along the Kansas Missouri border with his Jayhawkers\\". Lane acted gladly on Fremont's official authorization for a raid into Missouri. He raided the village of Morristown near the state line, burned it and swept a wide path of pillage, arson and murder of private citizens through the Missouri territory six miles wide and fifteen miles long. However as it turns out it had little to no effect on Mulligan.The Army of Tennessee p. 31 \\"His raids culminated in the Sacking of Osceola, in which Lane's forces killed at least nine men, then pillaged, looted, and then burned the town; these events inspired the novel Gone to Texas by Forrest Carter, which was the basis for the 1976 Clint Eastwood movie The Outlaw Josey Wales. Lane was criticized for his violence in Osceola, most severely by General Henry Halleck, then Commander of the Department of Missouri. Of their actions, he would state: \\"The course pursued by those under Lane and Jennison has turned against us many thousands who were formerly Union men. A few more such raids will make this State unanimous against us.\\" Thus, Lane's Brigade was ended.James H. Lane - Grim Leader in the Free-State Fight On December 18, 1861 Lane was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. On March 21, 1862, his commission was canceled in culmination of an argument over whether a sitting U.S. Senator could concurrently have the rank of General.Eicher p.338 However, on April 11, 1862, he was reinstated as brigadier general of volunteers with the confirmation of the U.S. Senate. During 1862‚Äì1863, he served as recruiting commissioner for the State of Kansas. On October 27‚Äì29, 1862, U.S. Senator Jim Lane recruited the 1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored) who debuted at the Skirmish at Island Mound. They are the first African-American troops to fight in the war, a year before the 54th Massachusetts. In their first action, 30 of their members defeated 130 mounted Confederate guerrillas.Border War Timeline, 1861 - 1865: The Civil War Lane was the target of the event that became the Lawrence Massacre (or Quantrill's Raid) on August 21, 1863. Confederate guerrillas could be heard shouting, \\"Remember Osceola!\\" Though Lane was in residence in Lawrence at the time, he was able to escape the attack by racing through a nearby ravine. During 1864 when Sterling Price invaded Missouri, Lane served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Army of the Border. Lane was with the victorious Union forces at the battle of Westport. Speech made in the US Senate by a Senator James Henry Lane from Kansas. \\"I would like to live long enough to see every white man in South Carolina in hell, and the Negroes inheriting their territory. It would not wound my feelings any day to find the dead bodies of rebel sympathizers pierced with bullet holes in every street and alley of Washington. Yes, I would regret this, for I would not like to witness all this waste of powder and lead. I would rather have them hung, and the ropes saved! Let them dangle until their stinking bodies rot and fall to the ground piece by piece.\\" Death and legacy On July 1, 1866 Lane shot himself in the head as he jumped from his carriage in Leavenworth, Kansas. He was allegedly deranged, depressed, had been charged with abandoning his fellow Radical Republicans and had been accused of financial irregularities. He died ten days later near Leavenworth, Kansas, a result of the self-inflicted gunshot. Edmund G. Ross was appointed to succeed him in the Senate.

It was formerly considered conspecific with the southern caracara (C. plancus) and the extinct Guadalupe caracara (C. lutosa) as the \\"crested caracara\\". It has also been known as Audubon's caracara. As with its relatives, the northern caracara was formerly placed in the genus Polyborus. Unlike the Falco falcons in the same family, the caracaras are not fast-flying aerial hunters, but are rather sluggish and often scavengers. Distribution The northern caracara is a resident in Cuba, northern South America (south to northern Peru and northern Amazonian Brazil) and most of Central America and Mexico, just reaching the southernmost parts of the United States, including Florida, where it has been seen on the East coast as far as extreme eastern Seminole County(Lake Harney), Florida where it is now considered a resident but listed as threatened. There have been reports of the northern caracara as far north as San Francisco, California. and, in 2012, near Crescent City, California. In July 2016 a northern caracara was reported and photographed by numerous people in the upper peninsula of Michigan, just outside of Munising. In June 2017, a northern caracara was sighted far north in St. George, New Brunswick, Canada. A specimen was photographed in Woodstock, Vermont in March 2020. The species has recently become more common in central and north Texas and is generally common in south Texas and south of the US border. It can also be found (nesting) in the Southern Caribbean (e.g. Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire). Description The mottled breast and pinkish-purple facial skin and cere are typical of immatures The northern caracara has a length of , a wingspan of , and weighs .Morrison, J. L. and J. F.

In Panama, males were found to average and females averaged .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . Among caracaras, it is second in size only to the southern caracara. Broad-winged and long-tailed, it also has long legs and frequently walks and runs on the ground. It is very cross-shaped in flight. The adult has a black body, wings, crest and crown. The neck, rump, and conspicuous wing patches are white, and the tail is white with black barring and a broad terminal band. The breast is white, finely barred with black. The bill is thick, grey and hooked, and the legs are yellow. The cere and facial skin are deep yellow to orange- red depending on age and mood. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are browner, have a buff neck and throat, a pale breast streaked/mottled with brown, greyish-white legs and greyish or dull pinkish-purple facial skin and cere. The voice of this species is a low rattle. Adults can be separated from the similar southern caracara by their less extensive and more spotty barring to the chest, more uniform blackish scapulars (brownish and often lightly mottled/barred in the southern), and blackish lower back (pale with dark barring in the southern). Individuals showing intermediate features are known from the small area of contact in north-central Brazil, but intergradation between the two species is generally limited. Habitat Northern caracaras inhabit various types of open and semi-open country. They typically live in lowlands but can live to mid-elevation in the northern Andes. The species is most common in cattle ranches with scattered trees, shelterbelts and small woods, as long as there is a somewhat limited human presence. They can also be found in other varieties of agricultural land, as well as prairies, coastal woodlands (including mangroves), coconuts plantations, scrub along beach dunes and open uplands. Behavior Northern caracaras fighting. Painted by John James Audubon. The northern caracara is a carnivorous scavenger that mainly feeds on carrion, but does occasionally eat fruit. The live prey they do catch is usually immobile, injured, incapacitated or young. Prey species can include small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish, crabs, insects, their larvae, earthworms, shellfish and young birds. Bird species that are culled can range from large, colonial nesting birds such as storks and herons to small passerines. Reptiles taken often including snakes, lizards and small freshwater turtles as well as young American alligators. This species, along with other caracaras, is one of few raptors that hunts on foot, often turning over branches and cow dung to reach food. In addition to hunting its own food on the ground, the northern caracara will steal from other birds, including vultures, buteos, pelicans, ibises and spoonbills. Because they stay low to the ground even when flying, they often beat Cathartes vultures to carrion and can aggressively displace single vultures of most species from small carcasses. They also dominate crows at carrion sites but are subordinate to the much larger bald eagle.Dwyer, J. F. (2014). Correlation of cere color with intra-and interspecific agonistic interactions of Crested Caracaras. Journal of Raptor Research, 48(3), 240-247. They will occasionally follow trains or automobiles to fetch food that falls off. An unexceptedly large volume of insects and spiders can be found in the diet in the southern United States.Morrison, J. L., Pias, K. E., Abrams, J., Gottlieb, I. G., Deyrup, M., & McMillian, M. (2008). Invertebrate diet of breeding and nonbreeding Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheriway) in Florida. Journal of Raptor Research, 42(1), 38-47.Morrison, J.

Southeastern Naturalist, 6(1), 1-14. In Florida, it was estimated that about 33% of vertebrate prey was obtained as carrion, which indicated that hunting groups may be capable of dispatching unusually large live prey, including Virginia opossum and skunks.Morrison, J. L., & Pias, K. E. (2006). Assessing the vertebrate component of the diet of Florida's crested caracaras (Caracara cheriway). Florida Scientist, 36-43. Adults of various water birds up to the size of egrets, grebes and even American white ibis are sometimes also killed by caracaras.P√©rez-Estrada, C. J., & Rodr√≠guez-Estrella, R. (2016). Caracara cheriway predation on migratory waterbirds, Egretta thula and Podiceps nigricollis, in southern Baja California Peninsula. Acta Zool√≥gica Mexicana (nueva serie), 32(1), 129-131. Northern caracaras can usually be spotted either alone, in pairs or family parties of 3‚Äì5 birds. Occasionally roosts may contain more than a dozen caracaras and abundant food sources can cause more than 75 to gather. The nesting season is from December to May and is a bit earlier the closer the birds live to the tropics. They build large stick nests in trees such as mesquites and palms, cacti, or on the ground as a last resort. The nests are bulky and untidy, wide and deep, often made of grasses, sticks and hay, spotted with much animal matter. It lays 2 to 3 (rarely 1 to 4) pinkish-brown eggs with darker blotches, which are incubated for 28‚Äì32 days. Although mesopredators such as raccoons and fish crows may steal eggs and nestlings from nests in Florida, adults may have no known natural predators.Layne, J. N. (1996). Audubon's Crested Caracara. In Rare and endangered biota of Florida. Vol. V: Birds., edited by Jr J. A. Rogers, H. W. Kale Ii and H. T. Smith, 197-210. Gainesville: Univ. of Florida Press. Red imported fire ants are another known predator of nestling crested caracaras.Dickinson, V. M. (1995). Red imported fire ant predation on Crested Caracara nestlings in south Texas. Wilson Bulletin 107:761-762. Taxonomy C. prelutosus fossil Though the northern caracaras of our time are not divided into subspecies as their variation is clinal, prehistoric subspecies are known. Due to the confused taxonomic history of the crested caracaras, their relationships to the modern birds are in need of restudy: * Caracara cheriway grinnelli (La Brea caracara: Late Pleistocene of California) * Caracara cheriway prelutosus (Late Pleistocene of Mexico) The former almost certainly represents birds which were the direct ancestors of the living population. The latter may actually be the ancestor of the Guadalupe caracara. A DNA analysis of 2,500 year old bones of the recently extinct Bahaman caracara, shows that the species was closely related to the northern crested caracara and the southern crested caracara. The three species having last shared a common ancestor between 1.2 and 0.4 million years ago. Florida caracara The state of Florida is home to a relict population of northern caracaras that dates to the last glacial period, which ended around 12,500 BP. At that point in time, Florida and the rest of the Gulf Coast was covered in an oak savanna. As temperatures increased, the savanna between Florida and Texas disappeared. Caracaras were able to survive in the prairies of central Florida as well as in the marshes along the St. Johns River. Cabbage palmettos are a preferred nesting site, although they will also nest in southern live oaks. Their historical range on the modern-day Florida peninsula included Okeechobee, Osceola, Highlands, Glades, Polk, Indian River, St. Lucie, Hardee, DeSoto, Brevard, Collier, and Martin counties. They are currently most common in DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee and Osceola counties. Loss of adequate habitat caused the Florida caracara population to decline, and it was listed as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987. Northern caracara in Mexico The Mexican ornithologist Rafael Mart√≠n del Campo proposed that the northern caracara was probably the sacred \\"eagle\\" depicted in several pre-Columbian Aztec codices as well as the Florentine Codex. This imagery was adopted as a national symbol of Mexico, and is seen on the flag among other places. Since the paintings were interpreted as showing the golden eagle, it became the national bird. Texan eagle Balduin M√∂llhausen, the German artist accompanying the 1853 railroad survey, led by Lt. Amiel Weeks Whipple, from the Canadian River to California along the 35th parallel, recounted observing what he called the \\"Texan Eagle,\\" which, in his account, he identified as Audubon's Polyborus vulgaris. This sighting occurred in the San Bois Mountains in southeastern Oklahoma.

It is also the most recent F5 tornado to have struck a central business district of a large city.Downtown Tornadoes Development At 10 am on 11 May 1970, the SELS (Severe Local Storms unit) issued an outlook that stated that isolated thunderstorms were possible in the High Plains region of West Texas, and amended the outlook at 1:25 pm to include the possibility that some of the storms may become severe. Warm and dry conditions dominated the area throughout the afternoon; the temperature peaked at a high of 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C) with moderate humidity. At 6 pm, large cumulus clouds began to appear in the area, and at 6:30 the first echoes indicating thunderstorms began to appear on radar scopes in nearby Amarillo. Less than half an hour later, Lubbock radar indicated the first thunderstorm activity in the immediate Lubbock vicinity: a moderate storm just south of the city near the small farming community of Woodrow. Conditions continued to deteriorate through the early evening, and at 7:30 the local weather bureau issued a forecast which included the developing thunderstorm activity. By 7:45 the thunderstorm south of the city was indicated by radar to be increasing in intensity, and at 7:50 the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Lubbock, Crosby and Floyd counties. Shortly afterward, reports of rapidly deteriorating conditions on the south side of the city of Lubbock began to come into the weather bureau and by 8:05, citizens south of the city were reporting golf ball-sized hail to the bureau. Tornado activity begins At 8:10 pm, an off-duty Lubbock police officer spotted a funnel cloud on the east side of the city, and grapefruit- size hail was reported. At 8:15, local radar indicated a hook echo and a tornado warning was issued for Lubbock and Crosby counties, and the first tornado to strike the city touched down seven miles south of Lubbock Municipal Airport, near the intersection of Quirt Avenue and Broadway. Since it was in a relatively sparsely populated area of the city, this first tornado caused little significant damage; however, reports of damaging hail continued to come in from around the city. At 9:15, tornado sirens in Idalou were sounded, and by 9:30 baseball-sized hail was falling in the northeastern sector of Lubbock. At about 9:35 pm, a second and much more significant tornado touched down near the campus of Texas Tech University, snapping light poles at Jones Stadium, home of the Red Raider football team, then began to track northeast, carving a path of destruction that at its peak reached almost two miles in width right through the heart of the city. The devastating twister tore through several densely populated residential areas before slicing through downtown, dealing a direct blow to the First National Bank building and the Great Plains Life building. The tornado then moved north toward the airport, where at 10:00 pm, anemometers were already reading winds of 77 knots (approximately . At 9:46, power failed at the Lubbock Civil Defense headquarters, and three minutes later, the local weather bureau lost power and its personnel took shelter from the tornado, which was now bearing down on the area and passed over the Weather Bureau building at 10:03 pm. The tornado continued north-northeast toward the communities of Abernathy and New Deal, where local authorities had begun sounding tornado sirens due to alerts passed along to them via two-way radio by the officials at the crippled Lubbock Weather Bureau office. The tornado finally dissipated at about 10:10 pm near the community of Petersburg.  Aftermath  The second tornado was devastating, affecting a area or roughly a quarter of Lubbock. Hardest hit were the inner city commercial and residential areas, the light industrial area south of Loop 289, and the residential area north of Loop 289 and the Lubbock Municipal Airport. A total of 430 homes were destroyed, 519 sustained major damage, and 7,851 more sustained minor damage. Some of the homes were completely swept away. Another 600 apartments were destroyed and 549 damaged, and one hundred mobile homes were severely damaged or destroyed. The Guadalupe neighborhood, consisting of mostly old wood frame or stucco homes, and parts of the Mesa Road area near the Lubbock Country Club, were almost completely leveled. Since the tornado hit the downtown area, over 250 businesses were also severely damaged or destroyed, including 20 city and county offices. Every motel along 4th Street and Avenue Q north of 10th Street sustained major damage, and several motels and other businesses along Avenue Q, which is a major artery through the city, were destroyed. Several banks and warehouses were severely damaged, and one nightclub lost its entire top floor. Eight elementary schools were damaged, as well as Lubbock and Estacado high schools, the latter losing a large portion of the roof over the gym. Damage was especially severe in the industrial areas of north Lubbock. At a grain storage complex, thick steel covers were peeled back from the tops of silos like soup cans. A 41-foot-long metal fertilizer tank, weighing 26,000 pounds, was thrown nearly a mile through the air. Large oil tanks in this area were hurled up to 300 yards away, and a railroad car was rolled for 50 yards.http://extremeplanet.me/2013/03/11/violent-tornadoes- that-have-struck-downtown-areas/ The Great Plains Life Building was left with a visible twist in its superstructure, leaving many to fear it was in danger of collapse; several radio towers on the roof were twisted or broken off. Much of the plaster in the stairwell walls between the 4th and 16th floors had cracked, and 60% of the building's windows were shattered. A foot of permanent deformation damage occurred at the steel frame on the south side, and three of the building's four elevators were damaged, with the support rails bent. In spite of the severity of the damage and amid cries to demolish, the owners chose to repair it instead, and it still stands. Some sources erroneously claim that the building was impacted by F5 winds. A thorough damage survey indicated that the F5 damage contour commenced farther north in the Guadalupe neighborhood. In addition to damage to buildings, there was damage to other property. Over 10,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed, and at Lubbock Municipal Airport, 100 private aircraft and 19 military planes were destroyed. Many utilities were damaged or destroyed and 220 light poles were toppled, leaving the city's two utility companies scrambling to restore power in the days immediately following the storm. The Southwestern Bell Company reported that 25,000 telephones were knocked out of service and 600 long distance lines were ruined. There was extensive ecological damages as well; many trees were damaged or destroyed, including the city's aged Chinese elm trees. Mackenzie State Park, Pioneer Park, Guadalupe Park and the Texas Tech campus lost almost all of their trees. Damage totaled $250 million, ($820,000,000 in 2015 dollars), making it the costliest U.S. tornado until it was surpassed by the Omaha Tornado of 1975. The storm's final death toll was 26 or 31; victims ranged in age from 9 months to 88 years of age. Many of the victims were found in their homes, where they had been killed by flying debris or structural collapse. One boy lost his life when he was sucked out of the car he was riding in, and an entire family of five died when their house was lifted from its foundation, hurled over 200 yards, and slammed into a field. However, the family's fatalities were not recorded by Lubbock, meaning that the death toll could have been as high as 31. Another five hundred people were injured. After the storm, Mayor Jim Granberry imposed a curfew, and Police Chief J.T. Alley issued orders that looters would be shot on sight. No looting was reported throughout the ordeal. The city council was directed to lead the rebuilding process, which continued under Granberry's successor, Morris W. Turner. The Lubbock Tornado also served as a model for the development of the Fujita scale, developed a year later. Bud Andrews and Ernesto Barton, Lubbock radio broadcasters, were given Presidential Citations from then U.S. President Richard M. Nixon for coverage of the disaster.

Opened in 1877 and built by R. Watkins (cemetery lodge, 1878) and P. Beddie (cemetery office, 1915), the cemetery is noted for its largely intact Victorian and Edwardian monuments. It is regularly cited as being one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. The cemetery contains the graves of many significant Australians including the poet Henry Lawson. It is also known as Waverley Cemetery and General Cemetery Waverley. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 October 2016. The cemetery is owned by Waverley Council and is self-funded, deriving its income from interments ‚Äì including burial, cremation, memorials and mausolea ‚Äì of which there has been over 86,000. Waverley Cemetery was used during the filming of the 1979 Mel Gibson film Tim. The cemetery was designed to function along similar lines to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Funerals are conducted Monday to Saturday.  History  =Indigenous history= The land on which Waverley Cemetery is located is traditionally the land of the Cadigal people of the Eora nation. As with most Aboriginal groups in Australia prior to European colonisation, the Cadigal people lived a traditional hunter- gatherer lifestyle that utilised the natural resources available in their environment to achieve the physical and spiritual nourishment to sustain their way of life. Evidence of the areas occupation by the Cadigal people is demonstrated in both archaeological (rock shelters, art sites, middens) and non-archaeological forms (creation sites, ceremonial places). Today, the Waverley area is a densely populated and urban environment and, although Waverley Cemetery is not known to contain identified Aboriginal sites (to date), its cliff top environment is regarded as archaeologically sensitive as it is considered likely to contain sites of Aboriginal significance. =Colonial history= European exploration into the coastal region of eastern Sydney commenced in the early 19th century when the establishment of a military outpost at South Head and the completion of the first roadway to the South Head Lighthouse (1811) gave settlers their first cursory view of the coastal landscape of the new colony. The opening up of the region soon saw the allocation of early land grants to prominent settlers in the locality. In the early years of the colony, the first cemetery (although never formally gazetted) was established on the outskirts of the town on the site of today's Sydney Town Hall. At the time of its selection and development in the 1790s, the Old Sydney Burial Ground reflected the attitudes of the European colonists of the period towards death and burial - essentially relegating cemeteries to the periphery of the colony out of fear of ill-health, disease and contamination from the dead. At this time, cemeteries were a necessity and not a place of remembrance and commemoration. By 1820, the Old Sydney Burial Ground was considered full and a new cemetery was laid out at Devonshire Street (Brickfield Hill), today's Sydney's Central railway station. Soon enough, by the middle of the century, this cemetery too was at capacity and an alternative location for the Sydney Necropolis was sought. In keeping with common social values, Haslem's Creek (now Rookwood Cemetery) was selected as the new location in 1862. Sited on the outskirts of both the Sydney and Parramatta settlements, Haslem's Creek was also served by the main western railway line. The relocation of burial services away from central Sydney soon caused difficulties for those living along the eastern coastline and those residents quickly became reliant on St. Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick (1853). Although a cemetery was planned from the 1840s, interments did not take place at South Head General Cemetery until 1869. Waverley Municipal Council, itself only proclaimed in 1859, soon recognised that a general cemetery was needed to service the developing community of the eastern suburbs and, in 1868, reserved A¬£1,200 to purchase for the establishment of the cemetery. Although the selected land remained on the periphery of the community, social attitudes towards death and burial had shifted by this time, away from those held during the early years of the colony. Society now desired picturesque, garden-like spaces where people could visit, remember and commemorate those who had passed. Cemeteries were no longer to be dark and forbidding places, avoided out of fear and paranoia. Following the purchase of a further , Waverley Cemetery was formally opened on 1 August 1877 and its first interment (of Ruth Allen, 85 years), took place on the afternoon of 4 August 1877. From its first intimations, Waverley Cemetery was to be a grand metropolitan cemetery honouring the high moral standard and respect of the Victorian era and it would reflect the social prosperity of the Waverley community. To manage the operation of the new facility, William Thomas was appointed as the first manager of Waverley Cemetery in 1877. Responsible for its day-to-day operation, Thomas conducted the development of the cemetery in accordance with a strict set of bylaws that governed its objectives with particular regard to style, layout and colours of headstones, grave sites and funerary furniture. Laid out professionally as a cemetery of the Victorian style and with its recurring use of ethereally white Italian Carrara marble, Waverley Cemetery soon resembled a strategic collection of individual memorials that portrayed a cohesive and unified visual character. Perhaps because of this visually pleasing effect when coupled with its dramatic natural setting, the cemetery proved to be highly popular with the community and its establishment costs were recovered entirely within the first year. In the years following its establishment and with the extension of the steam tramway to the site in 1890, Waverley Cemetery expanded with the acquisition of a further of land and by 1894 the cemetery had grown to its present size of bounded by Trafalgar, Boundary and St Thomas streets. It also saw the construction of a number of built elements on the site including the Caretaker's House, Cemetery Lodge, Waiting Room, Cemetery Gates, shelters, external fencing, sandstone walling and grounds terracing. Commenced in 1898 and completed by 1901, a substantial memorial to the 1798 Irish Rebellion was constructed at the cemetery. A large and imposing monument of white Carrara marble, intricately decorated with sculptures, plaques, inscriptions, medallions and mosaic and topped with a 30-foot carved cross, the monument was to be a testament to Ireland's struggle for self-government and its patriots who fought in the rebellion. Designed by John Hennessy of architectural firm Sherrin and Hennessy, the memorial is the largest monument to the rebellion in the world. Elevating it to a somewhat sacred status, the memorial contains the interred remains of the leader of the revolution movement, Michael Dwyer (d. 1825) and his wife Mary (d.1860). Originally buried at Sydney's Sandhills Cemetery (the site of today's Central railway station), the Dwyers were exhumed and reinterred at Waverley Cemetery in 1898. Attended by some 100,000 people, the relocation and interment of the Dwyers was the largest gathering of any 1798 rebellion centenary event in the world. Waverley Cemetery continued to expand throughout the 20th century, both in numbers and architectural diversity. The grand Victorian era of its establishment slowly morphed into the humbler Edwardian times which saw the introduction of cremation services to the cemetery. Its ongoing use also saw the installation of a substantial collection of funerary monuments that ranged in fashion and style, reflecting the cultural diversity and social values of the people of NSW. The Great Depression and the world wars bought further change to the cemetery and to the monuments and memorials that were being installed. Over its lifetime, Waverley Cemetery has received numerous high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world, including: Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Henry Kendall (poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Fran√ßois Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald Prize); Sir Frances Forbes (first Chief Justice of NSW); Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); William Dymock (book retailer); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); John Fingleton OBE (Australian Cricketer and \\"Bodyline\\" veteran) and Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor). Waverley Cemetery continues to be an operational burial facility today (2015). Its naturally picturesque and urban location has made it a particularly sought after and desirable cemetery and it now contains more than 100,000 burials and interments. Major coastal storms over a weekend in June 2016 led to the collapse of some 77,000m2 of fill in the gully in the centre of the cemetery. The Bondi-to-Bronte coastal walk through the cemetery was closed but has reopened, but the original route hugging the cliff face has been changed for safety concerns.Thompson, 2016 Environment & Heritage Minister Mark Speakman announced on 23 October 2016 the State Heritage Register listing of Waverley Cemetery. \\"Waverley Cemetery is the final resting place of many prominent Australians, Mr Speakman said. \\" Poets Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar...Olympic gold medal swimmer Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack and cricket batsman Victor Trumper are all buried in Waverley'. Member for Coogee Bruce Notley-Smith said the heritage listing would be warmly received by the eastern suburbs community.Daily Telegraph, 24 October 2016, p.11. In April 2017 the 1922 Sir Charles Wade memorial was restored with grant funding from the NSW government, and Waverley Council secured a community war memorial fund grant to do a conservation assessment of the 1894 Middle Head Submarine Mine Explosion Monument.Conway, Wentworth Courier, 5 April 2017, p.24.  Description  Graves at Waverley Cemetery Waverley Cemetery is uniquely positioned on an elevated urban site overlooking the Tasman Sea to the east and the Waverley townscape to the west. Spanning some 16 hectares, Waverley Cemetery retains much of its Victorian layout and geometric grid-like pattern of burials (north-south axis). Despite its suburban environment, Waverley Cemetery is dominated by its cliff top location and its expansive views to the ocean and horizon. The contrast of the natural and man-made elements combine to create a picturesque setting for the cemetery. Containing over 90,000 burials and interments, Waverley Cemetery is dominated by white marble monuments and headstones from the mid-to-late 19th century as well as a selection of later funerary furniture that demonstrate the changing social values and attitudes towards death it has experienced during its operation (1877 to present). The cemetery also contains various additions to older elements for example the Circle Garden containing interment of ashes created in a former garden area. Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments. This occurs because the cemetery occupies a valley and two adjacent ridges. Major monuments and memorials within Waverley Cemetery are situated at key points such as at the junction of main roads and pathways and other key vantage points at the edge of cemetery sections. Major monuments prominent in the landscape include the 1798 Memorial; the Governor Duff monument; the Henry Kendall monument; the Johnston family vault; the Greek Revival monument to Sir James Martin; and the Chowder Bay Monument. The 1798 Memorial has a central theme of martyrdom. The architect's brief called for \\"a monument in Irish architecture\\" to the memory of the 1798 rebels. The design was on an imposing scale calculated to make a strong impact. The design was also heavily influenced by the chairman of the organising committee Dr Charles MacCarthy (1848-1919), who was an award-winning sculptor, painter, musician and writer. The base of the memorial is wide and deep. The back wall rises above the ground and the height of the cross is . The main material is Carrara marble. The rear wall is decorated with bronze plaques and the floor has mosaic pictures of thatched cottages and round towers. Commemorations are conducted inside the memorial which effectively forms a \\"church sanctuary\\" or stage while onlookers gather on the surrounding driveways and paths. The monument was erected by Ross and Bowman (stonemasons). The memorial is located in the centre of Waverley Cemetery, facing north at the end of a main driveway.Whitaker, 2008 Another individual monument of significance is the Stuart family vault. Dating from 1914-1916 this is a surviving work from the partnership of Walter Burley Griffin, Marion Mahony Griffin and J. Burcham Clamp. James Stuart was the founding partner of Stuart Brothers, master builders. The tomb is situated on a prominent junction at the terminal point of two large retaining walls. Built of granite the vault features gothic detailing with a pyramindal roof form built from slabs of stone. Twin doors in heavy bronze face the ocean on the eastern side of the vault. These are cast with a prismatic pattern that at head height forms a double set of diamond shaped vents. The doors are flanked by polished granite tablets with gilded inscriptions to the memory of members of the Stuart family. Other detailing includes buttresses with lancet tracery and more prismatic patterning around the cornice of the vault. There is a granite urn near the entry doors. On the western wall a round ended cross is formed by the intersection of four granite blocks, which also provides ventilation for the vault.M M Griffin, W B Griffin, A J Watson, 1998; 75-76 Waverley Cemetery contains a number of early buildings, independent structures and built elements. The cemetery office, residence and amenities building are located at the entrance of the cemetery while a number of shelters are within the cemetery itself. The cemetery also contains substantial sandstone retaining walls and terracing, pathways, and remnants of sandstone road kerbing and guttering. The cemetery also retains key landscape elements including mature Norfolk Island Pines on the boundaries, Canary Island Date Palms within the cemetery and numerous remnant historic shrubs and grave plantings and more recently established garden areas. = Condition = As at 13 April 2015, historically a self-sustaining facility, funded entirely by the sale of grave plots and interments, Waverley Cemetery is in reasonable condition due to the past allocation of funds towards maintenance over the lifetime of the cemetery. In recent years, some areas of the cemetery have deteriorated. The cemetery is susceptible to damaging forces. As well as human vandalism and general age-related deterioration, the cemetery is also particularly vulnerable to environmentally-caused salt corrosion (metalwork), wind erosion (masonry) and algae and lichen growth on the headstones. Maintenance of individual grave plots is the responsibility of the family of the deceased and therefore some plots are in a more degraded condition than others. Dominated by white Carrara marble monuments of the mid-to-late 19th century, alternative materials have been introduced to Waverley Cemetery during its operation. Coloured granite (predominantly black and rose), however sparingly used, does detract from the Victorian nature of the site. The cemetery is, however, susceptible to damaging forces. As well as human vandalism and general age-related deterioration, the cemetery is also particularly vulnerable to environmentally-caused salt corrosion (metalwork), wind erosion (masonry) and algae and lichen growth on the headstones. Historical significance Grave of Henry Lawson George Freeman George and Charlotte Sargent Waverley Cemetery contains the graves of many people who shaped Australia. This includes literary figures such as Henry Lawson, (one of Australia's most famous poets), Jules Archibald, founder of The Bulletin and benefactor of the Archibald Prize, nineteenth century writer Louis Becke, nineteenth century Australian boxing champion Larry Foley, nineteenth century poet Henry Kendall, the American actor William E. Sheridan,An Actor's Grave. Saint Paul Daily Globe, 30 October 1887, p. 13 accessed 5.18.13 poet and author Dorothea Mackellar, and author Ethel Pedley. Other significant figures include aeronautical pioneer Lawrence Hargrave, Olympic swimmer Fanny Durack, and New South Wales Premier Sir James Martin, (whose remains were transferred to Waverley Cemetery after the death of his wife in 1909). The cemetery contains over 200 war graves from various past conflicts, of which there are 132 registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (over 100 from World War I and nearly 20 from World War II). The front gates are a memorial to the residents of the area who died during World War I and World War II . Inside the main gates is a memorial to the military forces of NSW which houses the remains of several officers killed in an 1891 sea mine explosion at Middle Head. At least eleven United States Civil War veterans are also buried at Waverley, including Phineas S. Thompson. In addition, the cemetery is home to the Irish memorial, the final resting place of Michael Dwyer (1798 Rebellion), and a memorial to all those who died in that rebellion. There is also a memorial stone commemorating the 1981 Hunger Strikers. As well as nationally famous figures the cemetery contains the graves of notable Sydney identities including Robert \\"Nosey Bob\\" Howard, the state executioner who served until 1904, rugby player Peter Burge and Sydney crime figure George Freeman. Architecturally, Waverley Cemetery is significant in that it showcases examples of Stonemasonry and funerary art dating back from the 19th century, with features (such as the gates, buildings and fencing) that due to their intact nature are considered of \\"outstanding aesthetic value\\". Included in this is a tomb designed for James Stuart and his family by the architects J. Burcham Clamp and Walter Burley Griffin.  Heritage listing  Waverley Cemetery is listed as a heritage item in the Waverley Council Local Environment Plan. In 2015 local resident action group Residents for Waverley Cemetery nominated the cemetery for inclusion on the State Heritage Register. The nomination was recommended by the Heritage Council and after receiving Ministerial approval was gazetted on 28 October 2016. In 2016 Waverley Council nominated Waverley Cemetery for inclusion on the National Heritage list. As at 13 August 2015, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a general public Victorian-era cemetery that is the final resting place for more than 100,000 people. Sited in an urban setting, against a dramatic natural landscape of the Pacific Ocean with its steep cliffs and the endless horizon, Waverley Cemetery is a picturesque urban burial ground that contains a collection of highly intact funerary monuments and furniture dating from 1877. Its earliest elements demonstrate the moral standards and religious philosophies of the Australian community in the Victorian period and, through the continuity of the cemetery's use to the present day and the gradual introduction of alternative funerary designs and interment practices throughout the years, the cemetery demonstrates the cultural diversity and changing social values and attitudes of the Australian people towards death and its commemoration over some 140 years. The aesthetic continuity of Waverley Cemetery is largely due to the strict management of the cemetery in the early periods of its development. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of high- achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world. Some of its most famous names include Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Francoise Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald art prize); Sir James Martin (NSW Premier); Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); members of the Cavill family of famous swimmers - Arthur, Charles, Ernest and Frederick Cavill; William Dymock (book retailer); Victor Trumper (batsman from the \\"Golden Age\\" of cricket); Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); and Michael Dwyer (revolutionary leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion). As an operational general public cemetery, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its demonstration of the historic and contemporary social character of Sydney and NSW. Waverley Cemetery contains a wealth of genealogical, historical, architectural and artistic information which makes it a significant public educational resource for NSW. Internationally, the Waverley Cemetery has been reported to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world - among the likes of England's Highgate Cemetery and Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Waverley Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a general public Victorian-era cemetery that is the final resting place for more than 100,000 people. Opened in 1877, in the picturesque cemetery design of the mid-to-late 19th century, the geometric layout and early funerary monuments of Waverley Cemetery demonstrate the moral standards and religious philosophies of the Australian community in the Victorian period. Through the continuity of the cemetery's use to the present day, and the gradual introduction of alternative funerary designs and interment practices throughout the years, the cemetery demonstrates the cultural diversity and changing social values and attitudes of the Australian people towards death and its commemoration over some 140 years. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world. Operating for over a century and the final resting place for over 100,000 people, Waverley Cemetery has buried and interred a diverse selection of notable people from literary, business, arts, political and sporting backgrounds. Some of its most famous names include Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Henry Kendall (poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Francoise Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald art prize); Sir Frances Forbes (first Chief Justice of NSW); Sir James Martin (NSW Premier); Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); members of the Cavill family of famous swimmers - Arthur, Charles, Ernest and Frederick Cavill; William Dymock (book retailer); Victor Trumper (batsman from the \\"Golden Age\\" of cricket); John Fingleton OBE (Australian Cricketer and \\"Bodyline\\" veteran); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor) and George Freeman (Sydney organised crime figure). Waverley Cemetery contains over 200 various war graves from past conflicts, including over 100 burials from World War I and nearly 20 from World War II. At least eleven United States Civil War veterans are also buried at Waverley Cemetery. Waverley Cemetery also houses the 1798 Memorial, a commemorative monument to those \\"Who dared and suffered for Ireland\\" in the rebellion led by the United Irishmen of 1798. This memorial is also final resting place of Michael Dwyer, \\"The Wicklow Chief\\" a revolutionary leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion who died in Sydney in 1825. The remains of Michael Dwyer and his wife were moved from the Devonshire Street Cemetery to Waverley Cemetery in 1898 (the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion). The 1798 Memorial commemorates subsequent events such as the Easter Rising of 1916 and the Long Kesh Hunger Strikes of 1981 (additional tablet at rear). The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic values. Sited in an urban setting, against a dramatic natural landscape of the Pacific Ocean with its steep cliffs and the endless horizon, Waverley Cemetery is a picturesque urban burial ground that contains a collection of highly intact funerary monuments and grave furniture of a refined palette (marble and stone) which demonstrates a comprehensive range of Victorian and Edwardian artistic elements. Many monuments feature statuary such as angels, cherubs, seraphs, mourning figures and occasional portrait medallions or busts; substantial pedestals topped with urns or spires; and Christian crosses. Smaller monuments such as stone desks often include carved decorations using floral relief, birds, crowns, and other symbolism. There is a consistent palette of materials throughout the site which is dominated by sandstone and white marble with inlaid lead lettering - granite, trachyte and other materials are less prominent. Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments. The cemetery retains a nineteenth century layout with many roadways still lined with sandstone kerbs, gutters and drains. The architecture and design of much of its earlier elements from the Victorian period reflect the social attitudes towards death and commemoration at the time of its construction. However the ongoing use and expansion of the cemetery has seen the gradual introduction of alternative funerary styles and fashions that reflect the cultural diversity and evolution of the people of NSW over time. Waverley Cemetery includes an unusual suite of cemetery structures including the main entry gates with iron palisade fence and sandstone pillars; the nearby sandstone office and waiting room building with associated residence and amenities buildings and a series of shelter sheds and sandstone retaining walls throughout the site. The cemetery also retains key landscape elements including mature Norfolk Island Pines on the boundaries, Canary Island Date Palms within the cemetery and numerous remnant historic shrubs and grave plantings. Major monuments and memorials within Waverley Cemetery are situated at key points such as at the junction of main roads and pathways and other key vantage points at the edge of cemetery sections. This makes these major monuments prominent items in the landscape when within the cemetery. Examples include the Irish Martyrs' Memorial; the Governor Duff monument; the Henry Kendall monument; the Johnston family vault; the Greek Revival monument to Sir James Martin; and the Chowder Bay Monument. Internationally, the Waverley Cemetery has been reported to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world - among the likes of England's Highgate Cemetery and Paris's Pere Lachaise Cemetery. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As an operational general public cemetery, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its demonstration of the historic and contemporary social character of Sydney and NSW. The fabric of the cemetery reflects the cultural and religious diversity of the Australian community since 1877 and its contemporary social significance is increased by its public accessibility and use by residents and visitors by virtue of its central metropolitan location. Prominent individuals and families are buried or interred at the cemetery and, as a genealogical resource, Waverley Cemetery is a significant educational asset for NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its educational and research potential. With its wealth of genealogical, historical, architectural and artistic information, Waverley Cemetery is a significant and readily accessible resource that is available to much of the NSW population by virtue of its central metropolitan location. The craftsmanship of the funerary monuments, demonstrated by rich examples from the Victorian, Edwardian and Inter-War eras, reflects social values and attitudes towards death and mourning in NSW since 1877. Furthermore, the array of funerary ornamentation demonstrates the changes in social fashions and taste over the decades and serve to reflect the impact of many international events on the activities of people in NSW (such as the Depression and the world wars). The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cemeteries of the same historical period are generally similar in layout, style and purpose but Waverley Cemetery is a notable example in NSW for its distinctive and picturesque setting on the Bronte cliff tops. The siting makes the cemetery both a place of remembrance as well as a passive recreational facility as part of the popular and well-known coastal walk from Bondi to the popular beaches of Bronte, Clovelly and Coogee. Once sited on the periphery of the Sydney colony, the retention of Waverley Cemetery in its now urban and desirable setting has seen the cemetery become a strikingly significant and intact open space in metropolitan Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a representative example of a burial ground that can demonstrate the principle characteristics of a general public cemetery from the Victorian period in NSW. The geometric layout and early funerary monuments of the Waverley Cemetery reflect the social values and attitudes of the Australian community towards death and commemoration in the mid-to-late 19th century. The ongoing operation of the cemetery and the gradual introduction of different styles and funerary fashions can also demonstrate the changing attitudes of the community towards funerary practices in NSW over time. Operation Waverley Cemetery and the boardwalk for the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk in 2018 The cemetery after more than 130 years of operation remains an entirely self-funded business. It has never been funded by the public purse or council ratepayers, with individual graves maintained for a fee. Where families no longer wish to maintain their ancestor's graves this has led to some significant memorials (such as those belonging to Jules Archibald and Victor Trumper) falling into disrepair. In 2002, the Waverley Council as owners of the business looked for alternative sources of revenue. These included corporate and private sponsorship for grave sites, and a proposed crematorium. This sponsorship plan met with limited success, although some graves have been restored with the assistance of sponsors ‚Äì including Jules Archibald's (by The Bulletin), Lawrence Hargrave's through the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the grave of Henry Lawson which was restored through a $10,000 grant by the State government. The plan to incorporate an on-site cremation into the existing business encountered vocal opposition, including by Liberal Party MP Malcolm Turnbull, the Federal Member for Wentworth, who spoke in Federal Parliament against the plan. The community opposition led to the plan being canceled in 2004. A two million dollar boardwalk designed to move joggers and others passersby away from the graves is now a popular part of the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk. In late 2007, the National Trust ran an online competition to determine the distribution of $185,000 in funding. Of the nine finalists, the Waverley Cemetery's ceremonial gates proved to be the most popular, winning the majority of the votes. Unfortunately, the amount voted to the project was only a little over 25% of the total restoration costs. Waverley Council has committed to funding the balance and work on this project is commencing in 2016. Cultural influences The earliest known motion picture filmed at the cemetery was the 1977 Italian production 'La Ragazza dal pigiama giallo', also known as 'The Pyjama Girl Case', a murder story based on the true story of Linda Agostini, the Pyjama Girl. In 1972 the cemetery was featured in filming for Spyforce where Colonel Cato played by Redmond Phillips was supposedly buried. In 1978 the cemetery was a location in filming of the movie Newsfront starring Bill Hunter and Bryan Brown. In 1979 the cemetery was a location in filming of the movie Tim starring Mel Gibson. Baywatch used the cemetery while filming its Australian movie length episode, and the Australian soap opera Home and Away buried one of their characters at Waverley in 2004. In 1996, scenes from the season one final of Australian TV show Water Rats were filmed at the cemetery. Notable recent films include Dirty Deeds. It was also pictured in the Bollywood Blockbuster Dil Chahta Hai in a musical sequence. The cemetery has been a place of inspiration for many artists, Henry Lawson who ultimately ended up there was fond of using the location in his stories, either as direct reference or indirectly. A panorama of the cemetery. South Head Cemetery South Head Cemetery is situated at the junction of New South Head Road and Old South Head Road, Vaucluse. It is administered by Waverley Council and is a companion cemetery to Waverley Cemetery. The cemetery was established to cater for the needs of the population in the growing Vaucluse area; its first interment was in 1868. It was run for some time by a private trust, but management was transferred to Waverley Council in 1941. It covers an expanse of and contains the graves of 6,000 people as of 2008. South Head General Cemetery contains the graves of many notable people, including: Australia's first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton (1920); NSW Governors Sir Walter Davidson (1923) and Sir Roden Cutler (2002); NSW Premiers Sir John Robertson (1891), Sir William Lyne (1913), Sir Charles Wade (1922) and Sir Joseph Carruthers (1932); Queensland Premier and Federal Treasurer ‚ÄúRed Ted‚Äù Theodore (1950); members of the Packer, Fairfax and Norton newspaper dynasties; members of the Street family legal dynasty including two Chief Justices, Sir Philip Whistler Street (1938) and Sir Kenneth Whistler Street (1972); Anglican Archbishop of Sydney John Charles Wright (1933); the Foy retailing family (including a monument to the disappeared Foy heiress Juanita Nielsen); architects Mortimer Lewis (1879), John Horbury Hunt (1904), Robin Dods (1920), Howard Joseland (1930), John Burcham Clamp (1931) and Neville Gruzman (2005); artist George Washington Lambert (1930); writers Jack Moses (1945) and Frank Clune (1971); entertainer Gladys Moncrieff (1976) and founder of the acting dynasty Roy Redgrave (1922); cricketer Warwick Armstrong; and Edmund Resch junior of the Resch's brewing family (1963). The cemetery contains the graves of 22 of the 40 victims of the 1927 Greycliffe ferry disaster. There are also Commonwealth war graves of 18 Australian service personnel, 5 of World War I and 13 of World War II, in various parts of the cemetery.

India is an ethnically and religiously diverse country. Given this diversity, it is difficult to generalize widely about the folklore of India as a unit. Although India is a Hindu-majority country, with more than three-fourths of the population identifying themselves as Hindus, there is no single, unified, and all-pervading concept of identity present in it. Various heterogeneous traditions, numerous regional cultures and different religions to grow and flourish here. Folk religion in Hinduism may explain the rationale behind local religious practices, and contain local myths that explain the customs or rituals. However, folklore goes beyond religious or supernatural beliefs and practices, and encompasses the entire body of social tradition whose chief vehicle of transmission is oral or outside institutional channels.  Folk art of India  The folk and tribal arts of India speak volumes about the country's rich heritage. Art forms in India have been exquisite and explicit. Folk art forms include various schools of art like the Mughal School, Rajasthani School, Nakashi art School etc. Each school has its distinct style of colour combinations or figures and its features. Other popular folk art forms include Madhubani paintings from Bihar, Kangra painting from Himachal Pradesh and Warli paintings from Maharashtra. Tanjore paintings from South India incorporate real gold into their paintings. Local fairs, festivals, deities and heroes (warriors) play a vital role in this art form. The culture of India has been broken down into five main geographical regions Some famous folk and tribal arts of India include: *Tanjore Art *Madhubani Painting *Nirmal paintings *Warli Folk Painting *Pattachitra Painting *Rajasthani Miniature Painting *Kalamezhuthu  Folktales of India  Thirayattam- (Karumakan Vallattu) India possesses a large body of heroic ballads and epic poetry preserved in oral tradition, both in Sanskrit and the various vernacular languages of India. One such oral epic, telling the story of Pabuji, has been collected by Dr. John Smith from Rajasthan; it is a long poem in the Rajasthani language, traditionally told by professional story tellers, known as Bhopas, who deliver it in front of a tapestry that depicts the characters of the story, and functions as a portable temple, accompanied by a ravanhattho fiddle. The title character was a historical figure, a Rajput prince, who has been deified in Rajasthan. Various performing arts such as Garba and Dandiya Raas of Gujarat, Sambalpuri dance of Odisha, Chhau, Alkap and Gambhira of West Bengal, Bihu of Assam, Ghoomar of Rajasthan and Haryana, Bhangra and Gidda of Punjab, Dhangar of Goa, Panthi of Chhattisgarh, Kolattam of Andhra Pradesh, Yakshagana of Karnataka, Thirayattam of Kerala \\"Thirayattam\\" (Folklore Text -malayalam), Bhasha Institute, Keralam - and Chang Lo of Nagaland derive their elements from myriads of myths, folktales and seasonal changes. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are the two greatest and most widely read epics of India. Other noteworthy collections of Indian traditional stories include the Panchatantra, a collection of traditional narratives made by Vishnu Sarma in the second century BC. The Hitopadesha of Narayana is a collection of anthropomorphic fabliaux, animal fables, in Sanskrit, compiled in the ninth century. Indian folklorists during the last thirty years have substantially contributed to the study of folklore. Devendra Satyarthi, Krishna Dev Upadyhayaya, Prafulla Dutta Goswami, Kunja Bihari Dash, Ashutosh Bhatacharya and many more senior folklorists have contributed for the study of folklore. But it is during the 1970s that some folklorists studied in US universities and trained up themselves with the modern theories and methods of folklore research and set a new trend of folklore study in India. Especially, South Indian universities advocated for folklore as a discipline in the universities and hundreds of scholars trained up on folklore. A.K. Ramanjuan was the noted folklorist to analyse folklore from Indian context. Study of folklore was strengthened by two stremas (sicsic); one is Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko and another is Peter J. Claus of American folklore. These two folklorists conducted their field work on Epic of Siri and led the Indian folklorists to the new folklore study. The Central Institute of Indian Languages has played a major role in promoting folklore studies in India to explore another reality of Indian culture. Recently scholars such as Chitrasen Pasayat, M. D. Muthukumaraswamy, Vivek Rai, Jawaharlal Handoo, Birendranath Dutta, P. C. Pattanaik, B. Reddy, Sadhana Naithani, P. Subachary, Molly Kaushal, Shyam Sundar Mahapatra, Bhabagrahi Mishra and many new folklorists have contributed in their respective field for shaping folklore study as a strong discipline in representing the people's memory and people's voice. Recently the National Folklore Support Center in Chennai has taken the initiative to promote folklore in public domain and bridging the gap of academic domain and community domain.  Indian folk heroes, villains, and tricksters  Indian folk heroes like Rama, Krishna in Sanskrit epics and history and also in freedom movement are well known to every one. They have found a place in written literature. But in Indian cultural sub-system, Indian folk heroes are most popular. The castes and tribes of India have maintained their diversities of culture through their language and religion and customs. So in addition to national heroes, regional heroes and local folk and tribal heroes are alive in the collective memory of the people. Let's take examples of the Santhals or the Gonds. The Santhals have their culture heroes Beer Kherwal and Bidu Chandan. Gonds have their folk hero Chital Singh Chhatti. Banjara folk hero is Lakha Banjara or Raja Isalu. But not only heroes, the heroines of Indian folklore have also significant contribution in shaping the culture of India. Banjara epics are heroine-centric. These epics reflect the \\"sati\\" cult. Oral epics with heroic actions of heroes and heroines produce a \\"counter text\\", as opposed to the written texts. Therefore, the younger brother becomes hero and kill his elder brother in an oral epic, which is forbidden in classical epics. Folk heroes are some times deified and are worshipped in the village. There is a thin difference of a mythic hero and romantic hero in Indian folklore. In Kalahandi, oral epics are available among the ethnic singers, performed in ritual context and social context. Dr Mahendra Mishra, a folklorist, has conducted research on oral epics in Kalahandi, taking seven ethnic groups. Dr. Chitrasen Pasayat has made an extensive study of different folk and tribal forms of Yatra, like Dhanu yatra, Kandhen-budhi yatra, Chuda-khai yatra, Sulia yatra, Patkhanda yatra, Budha- dangar yatra, Khandabasa yatra, Chhatar yatra, Sital-sasthi yatra and examined the 'hero characters' of the local deities. Indian oral epics are found abundantly everywhere there are caste based culture. Prof. Lauri Honko from Turku, Finland with Prof. Vivek Rai and Dr K Chinnapa Gawda have conducted extensive field work and research on Siri Epic and have come out with three volumes on Siri epics. Similarly Prof. Peter J Claus has done intensive work on Tulu epics. Aditya Mallick on Devnarayan epic, Pulikonda Subbachary on Jambupurana, Dr JD Smith on Pabuji epic are some of the commendable work that have been drawn attention of the wider readership.

You hear about these from the times of the Mahabharata and the Mughal empire. Some of the popular board games that originated from Indian Traditional games include Chess (Chaturanga), Ludo (Pachisi) and Snakes and Ladders (Moksha-Patamu). Recently, Odisha, a state in eastern India, introduced a child-friendly programme called Srujan (creativity) in the primary schools. About 18 million children took part in four activities like story telling activities, traditional games, traditional art and craft and music and dance and riddles over a period of three years (2007‚Äì2010). The result is that while there are hundreds of varieties of folktales, the varieties of traditional games are limited. About three hundred traditional games both indoor and outdoor were commonly played and it was found that the traditional games contain mathematical knowledge (like counting, measurement, shapes and size, geometrical ideas and finally socialization through action). The traditional games are the best ways of teaching and learning. When these are applied in the primary schools, many teachers revealed that children know many games that the teachers have forgotten. Indoor board game like \\"Kasadi\\" ( a wooden board with 14 pits played with tamarind seed by two or more than two girls in the domestic domain) was most popular and it is still not vanished from the society. Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra, a folklorist and an educator has collected these games and has documented in video form.Besides other games in the domestic domain is the goat and the tiger and ganjifa. These were the forerunners of the card games of today. Ganjifa used to be circular painted stack of card like things which were played using certain rules.  Indian folklorists  The scientific study of Indian folklore was slow to begin: early collectors felt far freer to creatively reinterpret source material and collected their material with a view to the picturesque rather than the representative. A. K. Ramanujan's theoretical and aesthetic contributions span several disciplinary areas. Context-sensitivity is a theme that appears not only in Ramanujan's cultural essays, but also appears in his writing about Indian folklore and classic poetry. In \\"Where Mirrors are Windows,\\" (1989) and in \\"Three Hundred Ramayanas\\" (1991), for example, he discusses the \\"intertextual\\" nature of Indian literature, written and oral...He says, \\"What is merely suggested in one poem may become central in a 'repetition' or an 'imitation' of it. His essay \\"Where Mirrors Are Windows: Toward an Anthology of Reflections\\" (1989), and his commentaries in The Interior Landscape: Love Poems from a Classical Tamil Anthology (1967) and Folktales from India, Oral Tales from Twenty Indian Languages (1991) are good examples of his work in Indian folklore studies. Rudyard Kipling was interested in folklore, dealing with English folklore in works such as Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies; his experiences in India led him to also create similar works with Indian themes. Kipling spent a great deal of his life in India and was familiar with the Hindi language. His works such as the two Jungle Books contain a lot of stories that are written after the manner of traditional folktales. Indian themes also appear in his Just So Stories, and many of the characters bear recognisable names from Indian languages. During the same period, Helen Bannerman penned the now notorious Indian-themed tale of Little Black Sambo, which represented itself to be an Indian folktale. After independence, disciplines and methods from anthropology began to be used in the creation of more in-depth surveys of Indian folklore. Folklorists of India can be broadly divided into three phases. Phase I was the British Administrators who collected the local knowledge and folklore to understand the subjects they want to rule. next were the missionaries who wanted to acquire the language of the people to recreate their religious literature for evangelical purpose. The third phase was the post-independent period in the country where many universities, institutes and individuals started studying the folklore. the purpose was to search the national identity through legends, myths, and epics. In the course of time, Academic institutions and universities in the country started opening departments on folklore in their respective regions, more in south India to maintain their cultural identity and also maintain language and culture. After independence, scholars like Dr Satyendra, Devendra Satyarthi, Krishnadev Upadhayaya, Jhaberchand Meghani, Prafulla Dutta Goswami, Ashutosh Bhattacharya, Kunja Bihari Dash, Chitrasen Pasayat, Somnath Dhar, Ramgarib Choubey, Jagadish Chandra Trigunayan and many more were the pioneer in working on folklore. Of course, the trend was more literary than analytical. It was during the 1980s that the central Institute of Indian Languages and the American Institute of Indian Studies started their systemic study on Folklore any after that many western, as well as eastern scholars, pursued their studies on folklore as a discipline. The pioneer of the folklorists in contemporary India is Jawaharlal Handoo, Sadhana Naithani, Kishore Bhattacharjee, Kailash Patnaik, VA Vivek Rai, late Komal Kothari, Raghavan Payanad, M Ramakrishnan, Nandini Sahu and many more. An emerging trend of new folklorists has emerged who are committed to understanding folklore from an Indian point of view than to see the whole subjects from the western model. Some of them are better to prefer to understand folklore from the folklore provider and consultants who are the creator and consumers of folklore. The user of folklore knows what folklore is since their use folklore with purpose and meaning. But theoreticians see folklore from their theoretical angle. Ethics point of view, folklorist should learn from the folk as practicable as possible and folk should give the hidden meaning of folklore to the folklorist so that both of their interpretation can help to give a new meaning to the item of folklore and explore the possibility of use of folklore in the new socio-cultural domain. Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra from Kalahandi, Odisha has substantially contributed to the tribal folklore of Middle Indian and Odisha. His seminal book Oral Epics of Kalahandi has been translated into Chinses, and Finnish language. HE has written Saora folk literature, Paharia Folkliterature, Visioning Folklore, Oral Poetry of Kalahandi. HIs recent seminal work is three oral Ramakatha in tribal oral tradition. Dr MIShra has written 5 books on Folklore Theory and Research methodology adopting the folklore of western Odisha and Chhattisgarh. TEh analytical work of Dr MIShra has been widely studied in the western and eastern world as a part of South Asian folklore. Now the National Folklore support Center, Chennai since the last ten years has created a space for the new scholars who are pursuing the study of folklore with their commitment. One important breakthrough in the field of folklore is that it is no more confined to the study in the four walls of academic domain, rather, it has again found its space within and among the folk to get their true meaning. Dr.Raghavanvpayyanad is a major role in Indian folklore study he has written so many books about folklore, he is also an international face of Indian folkloristics both in English and Malayalam.  Folk songs and folk music  India has a rich and varied tradition of folk music and numerous types of folk songs. Some traditional folk song genres have been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritage listed by UNESCO. Among these traditions, a well-known musical and religious repertoire is known as Baul, which has become famous in the World Music scene. Among the most respected historical figures of the Baul tradition, Lalon Fakir and Bhaba Pagla are often mentioned.

Ferdinand Wythe Peck (1848-1924) was a wealthy Chicago, Illinois, businessman and philanthropist, best known for financing Chicago's Auditorium Building. He was the youngest son of Mary Kent Peck and Phillip F.W. Peck. The family moved from Rhode Island to Chicago in the 1830s and made a fortune in real estate. Peck and his brothers took over the family fortune when their father died, and soon were among the wealthiest families in Chicago. Ferdinand was a civic- minded individual, and was involved in many projects around the city. He was a founding member of the Illinois humane society, and served on the city board of education. He was also a patron of the arts, particularly concerned with making high art available to the working classes. To this end, he organized the Chicago Grand Opera Festival in 1885. Out of the Festival grew a desire for a more permanent expression of his ideals. Shortly after the Haymarket Square riot, he began planning in earnest for what would become the Auditorium Building. To make his idea real, Peck hired architects Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan, who had worked for him previously to prepare the space for the Grand Opera Festival. Peck provided much of the funding and the central vision for the building, and the final design reflected his ideas as well as those of the architects.

It is within the local government area of Dubbo Regional Council. The town is from Sydney on the Great Western Highway and Mitchell Highway. History The area was originally occupied by the Wiradjuri people. Explorer John Oxley was the first European to find the area in 1817 and named it \\"Wellington Valley\\" after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Wellington was originally established in February 1823 by Lieutenant Percy Simpson as an convict settlement. Squatters started settling along the Macquarie Valley and in 1832 CMS was established in the settlement to teach Christianity to the Aboriginal people of the area. The convict settlement ceased in 1831 but in 1840, a village called Montefiores was established on the north side of the Macquarie River crossing. The Town of Wellington was gazetted in 1846, and on 20 March 1885, Wellington was proclaimed a town. Wellington Shire Council was established in 1949. Wellington is the second oldest New South Wales settlement west of the Blue Mountains. One of its hotels, the Lion of Waterloo, established by Nicolas Hyeronimus in 1842, is the oldest operating west of the Blue Mountains. The Lion of Waterloo is near the location of the last recorded duel fought on Australian soil in 1854. The extension of the railway from Orange to Wellington opened on 1 June 1880. As a regional centre Wellington benefited by the development of the gold mining industry in the district from the 1850s. Initially this was working alluvial deposits of gold but later focused on the mining of quartz reefs. Among the mining districts was Mitchells Creek located 8 miles to the north east near the locality of Bodangora.Osborne, Idle 1975 Annual Report Compilation, Wellington Division ‚Äì Dubbo Sheet 1875-1974, Department of Mines NSW, ARC080.

While alfalfa and vegetables are grown on lands on the river, wheat, wool, lambs and beef cattle are grown on surrounding pastures. The town acts as a commercial centre for the surrounding district. In September 2008, the Wellington Correctional Centre was opened. A Probation and Parole Office was also opened in the centre of town. Wellington Council hopes this will stimulate economic growth in the area, due to increasing employment opportunities and the need for non-locals to utilise Wellington facilities. The local newspaper The Wellington Times, a Rural Press title, is published three times a week with a circulation in the region of around 1000. There is a popular Community Radio Station operating on a frequency of 91.5 MHz FM. Climate Wellington has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters, and uniform rainfall throughout the year. The town is rather sunny, getting 138.1 clear days annually. In January, the average minimum temperature in the town is 16.9 ¬∞C and the average maximum is 32.9 ¬∞C, while in July the average minimum is 2.2 ¬∞C and the average maximum is 15.2 ¬∞C. Transport links Wellington railway station Welington station is served by a daily NSW TrainLink XPT service which runs between Sydney and Dubbo. The closest commercial airport is that of Dubbo. QantasLink and Regional Express service the airport three-five times daily from Sydney. A small airport (Bondangora Airport) for private planes exists twelve kilometres east of Wellington. Ogden's Coaches operates return services to Dubbo, with one extending to Narromine as a through-routed service with the Narromine link. Nearby attractions Lake Burrendong, a man-made lake, is located 30 kilometres south of the town. Its capacity is three and a half times that of Sydney Harbour and supplies water for irrigation schemes downstream. It is also a popular location for anglers, sailors and water skiers. Burrendong Arboretum is a sanctuary for endangered Australian flora and covers 1.60 km¬≤. The nearby Wellington Caves feature the Cathedral Cave with the massive Altar Rock and has a viewable underground river running at the bottom. Immediately to the East of the township lies the Catombal Range with magnificent bushwalks in and around Mt Arthur and Mt Wellesley. The Wellington Boot, a country racing festival is held in March and April annually. The Bell River Wine Estate is nearby.

It is located on the banks of the Mehi River, in the centre of the rich black- soil plains. Its name comes from an Aboriginal word for ‚Äúrising sun,‚Äù ‚Äúlong spring,‚Äù or ‚Äúwater hole.‚Äùhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Moree Moree is a major agricultural centre, noted for its part in the Australian cotton-growing industry which was established there in the early 1960s. The town is located at the junction of the Newell Highway and Gwydir Highway and can be reached by daily train and air services from Sydney. It is situated in the Moree Plains Shire. At the 2016 census, the town of Moree had a population of 7,383. Moree is home to artesian hot spring baths which are famous for their reputed healing qualities.Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Reader's Digest (Australia) Pty. Limited, Surry Hills N.S.W., 1993, History The Weraerai and Kamilaroi peoples, whose descendants are still in the town, were the early inhabitants of the area. Major Thomas Mitchell went to the district at the request of the acting governor after the recapture of escaped convict George Clarke who told of a great river called the Kindur in 1832. Clarke had been living in the area to the south with the Kamilaroi from 1826-1831. Squatters soon followed in Mitchell's wake establishing pastoral runs, among which was 'Moree' (1844), from a Kamilaroi term believed to mean either 'long waterhole' or 'rising sun'. In 1851 James and Mary Brand arrived and built a general store on the banks of the river in 1852. A post office was added the following year. The family sold up and moved to the Hunter Region in 1857 but James died in 1858 leaving Mary with six children so she returned opened another business and in 1861 she opened the town's first inn. Moree was gazetted as a town in 1862 with land sales proceeding that year. A court of petty sessions was established in 1863, and there was a severe flood in 1864. The first constable arrived and a police station was set up in 1865. The first church (Wesleyan) was built in 1867 when the town had a population of 43. As closer settlement proceeded agriculture emerged as a thriving industry on the fertile flood plains. Banking began in 1876 and the first local newspaper was set up in 1881, at which time the population was 295. The town became a municipality in 1890. During 1894 construction of the heritage listed Federation-style lands office commenced and ended that years with the completion of the ground floor. The second storey was added in 1903. In 1895 the Great Artesian Basin which sits under Moree was tapped and yields over thirteen megalitres of water every day. The bore was sunk to deep in order to provide water for agricultural pursuits but was proved unsuitable for this purpose. The railway line and service from Sydney arrived in 1897. Wheat cultivation increased after World War II with a flour mill built at Moree in 1951 and the first commercial pecan nut farm was established on the Gwydir Highway east of Moree in 1966. The Trawalla Pecan Nut Farm is the largest pecan nut farm in the southern hemisphere, growing about 75,000 trees. In 1994 the Gwydir Olive Grove Company was established when two Moree families started producing olive oil from olives grown in the area.Tourism Moree, Moree,2007/2008 Moree was one of the destinations of the famous 1965 Freedom Bus ride, an historic trip through northern NSW led by Charles Perkins to bring media attention to discrimination against indigenous Australians. It brought racial segregation in rural Australia to the attention of urban Australians, in particular at the Moree Baths and Swimming Pool as well as pubs and theatres, where Aborigines were refused entry. At the Moree swimming pool, after a confrontation with the council and pool management, it was agreed that indigenous children could swim in the pool outside school hours. In 2007 the Moree Plains Council announced plans for a $14m upgrade to the hot thermal baths. Floods have affected parts of Moree in 1955, 1971, 1976, 2011 and 2012 although much of the populated areas were and remain flood free.

In summer temperatures above are common while in winter temperatures below are also common. The highest recorded temperature recorded in Moree was on 3 January 2014 and again on 12 February 2017. Typical of humid subtropical climates rainfall is more common in summer than in winter. =Flooding= In January 1910 floods in the Moree district caused numerous washouts of the railway to Moree. An unknown number of livestock were drowned, and at least four people drowned in the Moree area. In January 1946 a flood cut the township in two, and several hundred homes were flooded. The flood waters affected the local power station which caused a blackout. The floods also damaged roads and railway lines in the region. The Gwydir River bridge at Moree was also damaged. In February 1955 the highest recorded major flood affected Moree, with a record flood peak of 10.85 metres. Most of the central business district of the town and 800 homes were flooded. In February 1971 a major flood affected the town, with a flood peak of 10.35 m. Four hundred people were evacuated and the township was isolated for two weeks. In February 1976, another major flood hit Moree, with a flood peak of 10.60 metres. Nearly three quarters of the buildings in north Moree either had floodwater surrounding them or water in them, which included the central business district. In February 2001, another major flood peak was recorded in Moree. There were a few houses with over floor flooding. Before the flood, nearly fell at Moree Airport within 48 hours. In November 2011, major flooding flooded parts of Moree, with a peak of 10.21 metres. People were urged to evacuate from parts of north Moree and houses were flooded. Nearly of rain was recorded over 72 hours with falling in the final 24 hours of rainfall. Moree and numerous other shires were declared natural disaster zones. In February 2012, major flooding again occurred in Moree. Peaking just 10 centimetres above the February 1976 floods at 10.69 metres, the floods inundated hundreds of houses in and around Moree. the floods were the second highest ever recorded in Moree. Nearly the whole of north Moree had water in the streets with just a few still out. The whole of north Moree was told to evacuate the day before the flood peak including the nearby villages of Yarraman, Gwydirfield, Bendygleet, Pallamallawa and Biniguy. Some of the lower parts of south Moree became inundated with flooding. All of north Moree were urged to evacuate as it was expected then to be the worst flooding in 35 years. No fatalities were recorded. Nearly of rain was recorded at the Moree Meteorological Station in the 72 hours before the flood. Other significant floods have occurred in 1864, 1890, 1921, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1974, 1984, 1998 and 2004.http://www.mpsc.nsw.gov.au/index.php?option=com_docman... Media Moree is served by the Moree Champion newspaper, owned by Rural Press, which is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Radio stations 2VM and 98.3 NOW FM also broadcast from Moree. The NOW FM transmitter site is located on Mt Dowe, whilst the 2VM transmitter is located 5 kilometres east of Moree on the Gwydir Highway. Both stations are owned by the Broadcast Operations Group and broadcast weekday breakfast and afternoon programs. Prime Television's Tamworth station also had a news bureau in Moree, but it was closed down in 2000 due to budget deficiencies.

He wrote influential works on economics, mathematics, physics, astrology and astronomy, philosophy, and theology; was Bishop of Lisieux, a translator, a counselor of King Charles V of France, and one of the most original thinkers of 14th-century Europe. Life Nicole Oresme was born c. 1320‚Äì1325 in the village of Allemagnes (today's Fleury-sur-Orne) in the vicinity of Caen, Normandy, in the diocese of Bayeux. Practically nothing is known concerning his family. The fact that Oresme attended the royally sponsored and subsidised College of Navarre, an institution for students too poor to pay their expenses while studying at the University of Paris, makes it probable that he came from a peasant family.Edward Grant, ed., De proportionibus proportionum and Ad pauca respicientes, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Pr., 1966), p. 4. Oresme studied the \\"arts\\" in Paris, together with Jean Buridan (the so-called founder of the French school of natural philosophy), Albert of Saxony and perhaps Marsilius of Inghen, and there received the Magister Artium. He was already a regent master in arts by 1342, during the crisis over William of Ockham's natural philosophy.William J. Courtenay, The Early Career of Nicole Oresme, Isis, Vol. 91, No.3 (Sept., 2000), pp 542‚Äì548. In 1348, he was a student of theology in Paris. In 1356, he received his doctorate and in the same year he became grand master (grand- ma√Ætre) of the College of Navarre. In 1364, he was appointed dean of the Cathedral of Rouen. Around 1369, he began a series of translations of Aristotelian works at the request of Charles V, who granted him a pension in 1371 and, with royal support, was appointed bishop of Lisieux in 1377. In 1382, he died in Lisieux.Edward Grant, ed., De proportionibus proportionum and Ad pauca respicientes, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Pr., 1966), pp. 4‚Äì10. Scientific work =Cosmology= A page from Oresme's Livre du ciel et du monde, 1377, showing the celestial spheres In his Livre du ciel et du monde Oresme discussed a range of evidence for and against the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis.Edward Grant, The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 114‚Äì16. From astronomical considerations, he maintained that if the Earth were moving and not the celestial spheres, all the movements that we see in the heavens that are computed by the astronomers would appear exactly the same as if the spheres were rotating around the Earth. He rejected the physical argument that if the Earth were moving the air would be left behind causing a great wind from east to west. In his view the Earth, Water, and Air would all share the same motion.Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, pp. 521‚Äì3 As to the scriptural passage that speaks of the motion of the Sun, he concludes that \\"this passage conforms to the customary usage of popular speech\\" and is not to be taken literally.Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, p. 531 He also noted that it would be more economical for the small Earth to rotate on its axis than the immense sphere of the stars.Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, p. 535 Nonetheless, he concluded that none of these arguments were conclusive and \\"everyone maintains, and I think myself, that the heavens do move and not the Earth.\\"Oresme, Le Livre du ciel et du monde, p. 537 =Critiques of astrology= In his mathematical work, Oresme developed the notion of incommensurate fractions, fractions that could not be expressed as powers of one another, and made probabilistic, statistical arguments as to their relative frequency.James Franklin, The Science of Conjecture, Evidence and Probability before Pascal (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), (see chapter 6, pp.140 - 145) From this, he argued that it was very probable that the length of the day and the year were incommensurate (irrational), as indeed were the periods of the motions of the moon and the planets. From this, he noted that planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way. Oresme maintained that this disproves the claims of astrologers who, thinking \\"they know with punctual exactness the motions, aspects, conjunctions and oppositions‚Ä¶ [judge] rashly and erroneously about future events.\\"Oresme, Ad pauca respicientes, p. 383. Oresme's critique of astrology in his Livre de divinacions treats it as having six parts. The first, essentially astronomy, the movements of heavenly bodies, he considers good science but not precisely knowable. The second part deals with the influences of the heavenly bodies on earthly events at all scales. Oresme does not deny such influence, but states, in line with a commonly held opinion,Wood, 1970. p. 9 that it could either be that arrangements of heavenly bodies signify events, purely symbolically, or that they actually cause such events, deterministically. Mediaevalist Chauncey Wood remarks that this major elision \\"makes it very difficult to determine who believed what about astrology\\". The third part concerns predictiveness, covering events at three different scales: great events such as plagues, famines, floods and wars; weather, winds and storms; and medicine, with influences on the humours, the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected, though he accepts that prediction is a legitimate area of study, and argues that the effect on the weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers are better at predicting weather than astrologers, and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction, noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars (because of precession of the equinoxes) since the zodiac was first described in ancient times. These first three parts are what Oresme considers the physical influences of the stars and planets (including sun and moon) on the earth, and while he offers critiques of them, he accepts that effects exist. The last three parts are what Oresme considers to concern (good or bad) fortune. They are interrogations, meaning asking the stars when to do things such as business deals; elections, meaning choosing the best time to do things such as getting married or fighting a war; and nativities, meaning the natal astrology with birth charts that forms much of modern astrological practice. Oresme classifies interrogations and elections as \\"totally false\\" arts, but his critique of nativities is more measured. He denies that any path is predetermined by the heavenly bodies, because humans have free will, but he accepts that the heavenly bodies can influence behaviour and habitual mood, via the combination of humours in each person. Overall, Oresme's skepticism is strongly shaped by his understanding of the scope of astrology. He accepts things a modern skeptic would reject, and rejects some things ‚Äî such as the knowability of planetary movements, and effects on weather ‚Äî that are accepted by modern science.Wood, 1970. pp. 8‚Äì11 =Sense perception= In discussing the propagation of light and sound, Oresme adopted the common medieval doctrine of the multiplication of species,Bert Hansen, Nicole Oresme and the Marvels of Nature (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1985), pp. 89-90. as it had been developed by optical writers such as Alhacen, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, John Pecham, and Witelo.David C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 78‚Äì80, 98, 113‚Äì16. Oresme maintained that these species were immaterial, but corporeal (i.e., three-dimensional) entities.Peter Marshall, \\"Nicole Oresme on the Nature, Reflection, and Speed of Light,\\" Isis, 72 (1981): 357‚Äì374, pp. 360‚Äì2. =Mathematics= Oresme's most important contributions to mathematics are contained in Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the intensio (the degree of heat at each point) and the extensio (as the length of the heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call rectangular co-ordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness, whiteness, and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed, the longitudo represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled. He shows that his method of figuring the latitude of forms is applicable to the movement of a point, on condition that the time is taken as longitude and the speed as latitude; quantity is, then, the space covered in a given time. In virtue of this transposition, the theorem of the latitudo uniformiter difformis became the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion; thus Oresme published what was taught over two centuries prior to Galileo's making it famous.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Nicole Oresme\\" Diagrams of the velocity of an accelerating object against time in On the Latitude of Forms by Oresme have been cited to credit Oresme with the discovery of \\"proto bar charts\\". Significantly, Oresme developed the first proof of the divergence of the harmonic series. His proof, requiring less advanced mathematics than current \\"standard\\" tests for divergence (for example, the integral test), begins by noting that for any n that is a power of 2, there are n/2 - 1 terms in the series between 1/(n/2) and 1/n. Each of these terms is at least 1/n, and since there are n/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2. For instance, there is one term 1/2, then two terms 1/3+1/4 that together sum to at least 1/2, then four terms 1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8 that also sum to at least 1/2, and so on. Thus the series must be greater than the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 \\\\+ 1/2 + ..., which does not have a finite limit. This proves that the harmonic series must be divergent. This argument shows that the sum of the first n terms grows at least as fast as (1/2) \\\\log_2 n. Oresme was the first mathematician to prove this fact, and (after his proof was lost) it was not proven again until the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli. He also worked on fractional powers, and the notion of probability over infinite sequences, ideas which would not be further developed for the next three and five centuries, respectively. = On local motion = Oresme, like many of his contemporaries such as John Buridan and Albert of Saxony, shaped and critiqued Aristotle's and Averroes's theories of motion to their own liking. Taking inspiration from the theories of forma fluens and fluxus formae, Oresme would suggest his own descriptions for change and motion in his commentary of Physics. Forma fluens is described by William of Ockham as \\"Every thing that is moved is moved by a mover,\\" and fluxus formae as \\"Every motion is produced by a mover.\\" Buridan and Albert of Saxony each subscribed to the classic interpretation of flux being an innate part of an object, but Oresme differs from his contemporaries in this aspect. Oresme agrees with fluxus formae in that motion is attributed to an object, but that an object is ‚Äúset into‚Äù motion, rather than ‚Äúgiven‚Äù motion, denying a distinction between a motionless object and an object in motion. To Oresme, an object moves, but it is not a moving object. Once an object begins movement through the three dimensions it has a new ‚Äúmodus rei‚Äù or ‚Äúway of being,‚Äù which should only be described through the perspective of the moving object, rather than a distinct point. This line of thought coincides with Oresme's challenge to the structure of the universe. Oresme's description of motion was not popular, although it was thorough. A Richard Brinkley is thought to be an inspiration for the modus-rei description, but this is uncertain. = Political thought = Oresme provided the first modern vernacular translations of Aristotle's moral works that are still extant today. Between 1371 and 1377 he translated Aristotle's Ethics, Politics and Economics (the last of which is nowadays considered to be pseudo- Aristotelian) into Middle French. He also extensively commented on these texts, thereby expressing some of his political views. Like his predecessors Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne (and quite unlike Aristotle), Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government.Mario Grignaschi: Nicolas Oresme et son commentaire √† la ¬´Politique¬ª d'Aristote, in: Album Helen Maud Cam, Louvain 1960 (Studies Presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, 23), 95‚Äì151, esp. 99‚Äì106. His criterium for good government is the common good. A king (by definition good) takes care of the common good, whereas a tyrant works for his own profit. A monarch can ensure the stability and durability of his reign by letting the people participate in government. This has rather confusingly and anachronistically been called popular sovereignty.Shulamith Shahar: Nicolas Oresme, un penseur politique ind√©pendant de l'entourage du roi Charles V, in: L'information historique 32 (1970), 203‚Äì209. Like Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Auvergne and especially Marsilius of Padua, whom he occasionally quotes, Oresme conceives of this popular participation as rather restrictive: only the multitude of reasonable, wise and virtuous men should be allowed political participation by electing and correcting the prince, changing the law and passing judgement.Mario Grignaschi: Nicolas Oresme et son commentaire √† la ¬´Politique¬ª d'Aristote, in: Album Helen Maud Cam, Louvain 1960 (Studies Presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, 23), 95‚Äì151, esp. 111‚Äì112; Jacques Krynen: Aristot√©lisme et r√©forme de l'Etat, en France, au XIVe si√®cle, in: J√ºrgen Miethke (ed.): Das Publikum politischer Theorie im 14.

Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 221‚Äì225. Oresme, however, categorically denies the right of rebellion since it endangers the common good.Susan M. Babbitt: Oresme's Livre de Politiques and the France of Charles V., in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 75,1 (1985), 1‚Äì158, esp. 83‚Äì84; Ulrich Meier: Molte revoluzioni, molte novit√†.

Wahrnehmungsformen, Erkl√§rungsmuster, Regelungsmechanismen, Sigmaringen 1994, 119‚Äì176, esp. 127‚Äì129. Unlike earlier commentators, however, Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the king's will.James M. Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 211‚Äì212. It must only be changed in cases of extreme necessity.Jacques Krynen: L'empire du roi. Ide√©s et croyances politiques en France. XIIIe‚ÄìXVe si√®cle, Paris 1993, 266‚Äì272. Oresme favours moderate kingship,James M.

Furthermore, Oresme doesn't comply to contemporary conceptions of the French king as sacred, as promoted by √âvrart de Tr√©maugon in his Songe du vergier or Jean Golein in his Trait√© du sacre.Shulamith Shahar: Nicolas Oresme, un penseur politique ind√©pendant de l'entourage du roi Charles V, in: L'information historique 32 (1970), 203‚Äì209; Vanina Kopp: Der K√∂nig und die B√ºcher.

Although he heavily criticises the Church as corrupt, tyrannical and oligarchical, he never fundamentally questions its necessity for the spiritual well-being of the faithful.Susan M. Babbitt: Oresme's Livre de Politiques and the France of Charles V., in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 75,1 (1985), 1‚Äì158, esp. 98‚Äì146. It has traditionally been thought that Oresme's Aristotelian translations had a major impact on King Charles V's politics: Charles' laws concerning the line of succession and the possibility of a regency for an underage king have been accredited to Oresme, as has the election of several high-ranking officials by the king's council in the early 1370s.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 5‚Äì43, esp. 9. Oresme may have conveyed Marsilian and conciliarist thought to Jean Gerson and Christine de Pizan.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 30; Cary J. Nederman: A Heretic Hiding in Plain Sight. The Secret History of Marsiglio of Padua's Defensor Pacis in the Thought of Nicole Oresme, in: John Christian Laursen u.a. (eds.): Heresy in Transition. Transforming Ideas of Heresy in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, London 2005 (Catholic Christendom, 1300‚Äì1700), 71‚Äì88. = Economics = With his Treatise on the origin, nature, law, and alterations of money (De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum), one of the earliest manuscripts devoted to an economic matter, Oresme brings an interesting insight on the medieval conception of money. Oresme's viewpoints of theoretical architecture are outlined in Part 3 and 4 of his work from De moneta, which he completed between 1356 and 1360. His belief is that humans have a natural right to own property; this property belongs to the individual and community. In Part 4, Oresme provides a solution to a political problem as to how a monarch can be held accountable to put the common good before any private affairs. Though the monarchy rightfully has claims on all money given an emergency, Oresme states that any ruler that goes through this is a ‚ÄúTyrant dominating slaves‚Äù. Oresme was one of the first medieval theorists that did not accept the right of the monarch to have claims on all money as well as ‚Äúhis subjects‚Äô right to own private property.‚Äù = Psychology = Oresme was known to be a well rounded psychologist. He practiced the technique of ‚Äúinner senses‚Äù and studied the perception of the world. Oresme contributed to 19th and 20th century psychology in the fields of cognitive psychology, perception psychology, psychology of consciousness, and psychophysics. Oresme discovered the psychology of unconscious and came up with the theory of unconscious conclusion of perception. He developed many ideas beyond quality, quantity, categories and terms which were labeled ‚Äútheory of cognition‚Äù.

Created and written by Kurt Busiek, the series is mostly illustrated by Brent Anderson, with character designs and painted covers by Alex Ross. The first volume was published from 1995 to 1996 by Image Comics. In 1996, a second volume was launched under the Homage Comics imprint of Image partner studio WildStorm, which was then acquired by DC Comics, where the series later transitioned to the WildStorm Signature Series imprint and continued until 2010. During this period it switched from a regular ongoing series to a sequence of periodic mini-series and special issues. A third, ongoing volume was launched under DC's Vertigo imprint in 2013 and concluded in 2018, reverting to occasional miniseries and original graphic novels. Counting all series, mini-series and special issues, over 100 issues have been published.

The Populares emerged as a political group with the reforms of the Gracchi brothers, who were tribunes of the plebs between 133 and 121 BC. Although the Gracchi belonged to the highest Roman aristocracy since they were the grandsons of Scipio Africanus, they were concerned for the urban poor, whose dire condition increased the risk of a social crisis at Rome. They tried to implement a vast social program comprising a grain dole, new colonies, and a redistribution of the Ager publicus in order to alleviate their situation. They also drafted laws to grant Roman citizenship to Italian allies and reform the judicial system to tackle corruption. Both brothers were murdered by their opponents, the Optimates, the conservative faction representing the interests of the landed aristocracy, which dominated the Senate. Several tribunes of the plebs later tried to pass the Gracchi's program by using plebiscites to bypass senatorial opposition, but Saturninus and Clodius Pulcher suffered the same fate as the Gracchi. Furthermore, many politicians of the late Republic postured as Populares to enhance their popularity among the plebs, notably Julius Caesar and Octavian (later Augustus), who finally enacted most of the Populares' agenda during their rule. The Populares counted a number of patricians, the most ancient Roman aristocrats, such as Appius Claudius Pulcher, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, and Julius Caesar among their number. They were allied to politicians of lesser status, especially \\"new men\\" like Gaius Marius, or Gaius Norbanus, who might have even been a new Roman citizen.  History  Denarius of the Popularis Lucius Farsuleius Mensor, minted in 75 BC. The obverse depicts Libertas and a pileus, a probable reference to the restoration of the tribunate of the plebs that year. On the reverse, Mars helps a man in a toga into a biga, perhaps an allegory of the Populares' campaign for enrolling into the electoral rolls the Italians who had received the citizenship after the Social War.T. P. Wiseman, \\"The Census in the First Century B.C.\\", p. 65.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 406, 407. The plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) and the Plebeian Council (the assembly of the plebeians) at times clashed with the Senate over the mentioned reforms and over the power relationship between the plebeian institutions and the Senate. The Optimates among the senators spearheaded the senatorial opposition. These tribunes were supported by Populares politicians such as Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar, who were often patricians, or equites. Their conflicts also played a part in some of the civil wars of the Late Roman Republic: Sulla's first civil war (88‚Äì87 BC), Sulla's second civil war (82‚Äì81 BC), the Sertorian War (83‚Äì72 BC), Lepidus' rebellion (77 BC), Caesar's Civil War (49‚Äì45 BC), the post-Caesarian civil war (44‚Äì43 BC), the Liberators' civil war (44‚Äì42 BC) and the Sicilian revolt (44‚Äì36 BC). The Populares reached the height of their ascendancy four times. The first one was with the Gracchi brothers, who mobilized the plebeians in support of their land reform and their challenge to senatorial supremacy (133 BC and 122 BC). This almost was not the issue because the Populares had help from the Italians and they had to offer more land to the Italians than they wanted to. The land was meant to go to the poor.de Ligt, Luuk and Northwood, Simon J. People, Land, and Politics: Demographic Developments and the Transformation of Roman Italy 300 BC-AD 14 (2008). Leiden. Brill NV. The second time was with Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the Younger, when the Marians (the supporters of Marius, who were Populares) seized power and held Rome from 87 BC to 82 BC. They were defeated in Sulla's Second Civil War. This was caused by the deteriorating relationship between Sulla and Marius as they started to fall apart from the consul stand point and lost view of what was important. The third time was when Julius Caesar was elected as consul in 59 BC with the support of Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey, who formed an informal alliance with Caesar which historians call the First Triumvirate (60‚Äì53 BC). These three helped bring Rome back to order from the scene it was when Sulla had left. The First Triumvirate gave each of the men their own land to watch over so parts of Rome were equally distributed among themselves so none of them would have too much to rule over.Sheppard, P.

Retrieved from World History in video database. Caesar managed to pass an agrarian law for a land reform, which had not been achieved since the agrarian law of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus of 133 BC as all subsequent attempts at agrarian legislation had been thwarted by the opposition and obstructionism of the Optimates. Tensions between Populares and Optimates had increased with the Catiline conspiracy (63 BC) against the consulship of Marcus Tullius Cicero (an Optimate) during which Cicero, supported by a final decree (senatus consultum ultimum) of the Senate, had some of the conspirators executed without trial. There were demonstrations against these summary executions and this display of arbitrary senatorial power. There were two attempts to counter senatorial dominance which failed, but they were popular. The proponents were Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos Iunior, a plebeian tribune; and Julius Caesar, who at the time was a praetor.Sumner, G. V. Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus (1966). Transactions and proceedings of the American Philological Association. Vol. 97. pp. 573.Mitchell, T. N. Cicero, Pompey and the Rise of the First Triumvirate (1973). Traditio. Vol. 29. pp. 2‚Äì8. This enhanced Caesar's popularity and was a help for his creation of the First Triumvirate three years later. The fourth time was with Caesar's Civil War, when Caesar held power from 49 BC to when he was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar relied on the support of the people for his power.Pelling, Christopher. \\"Plutarch and Roman Politics\\" in Past Perspectives: Studies in Greek and Roman Historical Writing. Papers Presented at a Conference in Leeds, 6‚Äì8 April 1983 (Cambridge University Press, 1986). pp. 159‚Äì16, 165‚Äì169.Plutarch (Parallel Lives, the Life of Caesar) is very concerned to explain Julius Caesar's rise to tyranny. From the beginning, Caesar is the champion and the favorite of the Roman demos. When they support him, he rises, but when he loses their favor he falls too.Cassius Dio (36.43.3) noted that Julius Caesar \\"courted the good-will of the multitude, observing how much stronger they were than the senate\\".Millar, Fergus.

Members  Notable Populares included men who held the plebeian tribunate such as the Gracchi brothers, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, Marcus Livius Drusus, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, Servilius Rullus and Publius Clodius Pulcher; and men who held the consulship such as Appius Claudius Pulcher, Publius Mucius Scaevola, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus (who also became a plebeian tribune), Gaius Marius, Gaius Marius the Younger, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Julius Caesar. There were other notable Populares such as Quintus Sertorius, who participated in the capture of Rome by the Marians in 87 BC and fought the Sertorian War, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Marc Antony, who fought for Caesar, were given a consulship by him and later became members of the Second Triumvirate. Although Marcus Licinius Crassus did not play a prominent part in Roman politics apart from his consulship in 70 BC, prior to being part of the First Triumvirate he was known as a supporter of the Populares.Sumner, G. V. Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus (1996). Transactions and proceedings of the American Philological Association. Vol. 97. p. 573. Pompey was also a member of the First Triumvirate. The Optimates in the Senate side-lined him and frustrated his attempts to have his settlements in the east after his victory in the Third Mithridatic War ratified and to promote an agrarian reform to redistribute land to his veterans.

After the death of Crassus, Pompey drifted towards the Optimates.Boatwright, Gargola (2004). p. 244. These shifting allegiances are reminders that the designation Populares refers as much to political tactics as to any perceived policy. Holland notes that republican politicians \\"had always been more divided on issues of style than of policy\\".Holland, T. Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic (2003). London. Abacus. p. 194.  Ideology  Roma is portrayed on the obverse, while the reverse depicts the Columna Minucia, with at the top a statue of his ancestor Lucius Minucius Augurinus, who as praefectus annonae in 439 BC organised a corn distribution. This coin participates to the Popularis propaganda in favour of the grain dole.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 273‚Äì276. A historian of the Late Republic cautions against understanding the terms populares and optimates as formally organized factions with an ideological basis: This summarizes the dominant interpretation of the Populares in 20th-century scholarship, deriving in large part from Ronald Syme in the Anglophone literature. In the early 21st century and as early as the publication of the ninth volume of The Cambridge Ancient History in 1994,Andrew Lintott. \\"Political History, 146‚Äì96 B.C.\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1994). p. 52. the validity of examining Popularist ideology in the context of Roman political philosophy has been reasserted. In particular, T. P. Wiseman has rehabilitated the use of the word \\"party\\" to describe the political opposition between Optimates and Populares, based on Latin usage (partes) and pointing to the consistency of a sort of party platform based on the food supply and general welfare of the populus (\\"people\\"), making land available to those outside the senatorial elite and debt relief.Though this has been a strand in Wiseman's scholarship over the decades, see particularly the introduction and \\"Roman History and the Ideological Vacuum\\" in Remembering the Roman People: Essays on Late-Republican Politics and Literature (Oxford University Press, 2009) at p. 14 for partes and \\"party\\". A less truncated version of \\"Roman History and the Ideological Vacuum\\" may be found in Classics in Progress (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 285. Politicians adhering to Popularist rhetoric or implementing Popularist policies usually did so not out of genuine belief in the cause or out of altruism, but rather to ingratiate themselves with the masses in order to achieve their own goals or those of patrons. Julius Caesar exemplified this once he became Roman dictator, involving himself in attracting teachers and doctors and the replacement of slaves on farms (important issues to the poor), but also disbanding clubs fellow Popularist Publius Clodius Pulcher used to maintain his own infuence, seeing him as a threat to his rule. Those in the Populares tradition also tended to oppose the use of the death penalty. A true distinction between the populares and optimates usually only showed intermittently, however, mainly in relation to some contentious measure.

Ancient Roman society Populism Roman Republic ","title":"Populares"},{"id":"593678","text":"During the Roman Republic, nobilis (\\"noble\\", nobilitas, plural nobiles) was a descriptive term of social rank, usually indicating that a member of the family had achieved the consulship. Those who belonged to the hereditary patrician families were noble, but plebeians whose ancestors were consuls were also considered nobiles. The transition to nobilitas thus required the rise of a non-noble individual to the consulship, who was considered a \\"new man\\" (novus homo). Two of the most famous examples of these self-made \\"new men\\" were Gaius Marius, who held the consulship seven times, and Cicero. The Second Samnite War (326‚Äì304 BC) was a formative time in the creation of this ruling elite comprising both patricians and plebeians who had risen to power.E.T. Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 217. From the mid-4th century to the early 3rd century BC, several plebeian- patrician \\"tickets\\" for the consulship repeated joint terms, suggesting a deliberate political strategy of cooperation.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005), p. 269. Scholarly attempts to define nobilitas have led to debates over the particulars of its usage in ancient sources. Fergus Millar points out that nobilis was a descriptive word as used in the Late Republic, and not a technical term for a restricted social group in the sense of peerage. Matthias GelzerMatthias Gelzer, Die Nobilit√§t der r√∂mischen Republik (1912). held that the term was reserved for descendants of consuls, and therefore reckoned that Munatius Plancus, consul designate for 42 BC,Designated by Julius Caesar while dictator. was the last man to qualify as an ancestor for a nobilis.Matthias Gelzer, in Hermes 50 (1915) 395ff., as noted by Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy p. 51, observing that \\"the notion was peculiar and vulnerable.\\" P.A. Brunt,P.A. Brunt, \\"Nobilitas and novitas,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 72 (1982) 1‚Äì17. building on the view of Theodor Mommsen, assembled evidence of broader usage that suggests any curule office might grant the aura of nobilitas. The term is not found in the literature of the mid-Republic, and came into use long after the social and political changes that created \\"noble\\" plebeians.Fergus Millar, \\"The Political Character of the Classical Roman Republic, 200‚Äì151 B.C.,\\" as reprinted in Rome, the Greek World, and the East (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 126 online, originally published in Journal of Roman Studies 74 (1984) 1‚Äì19. During the time of Augustus, a nobilis enjoyed easier access to the consulship, with a lowered age requirement perhaps set at 32. Women who descended from Augustan consuls are also regarded as belonging to the Roman nobility.Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford University Press, 1989, 2nd ed.), pp. 50‚Äì52 online. In the usage of Tacitus and Pliny Minor,Pliny, Panegyricus Traiani 69.5: illos ingentium virorum nepotes, illos posteros libertatis (\\"those grandsons of outsized men, those descendants of liberty\\"). a nobilis is a descendant of the Republican aristocracy. The meaning of nobilis then evolved during the Imperial period. See also *Cursus honorum References Further reading * Adam Afzelius: Zur Definition der r√∂mischen Nobilit√§t in der Zeit Ciceros.

This helps to ensure that the process operates efficiently, producing more specification-conforming products with less waste (rework or scrap). SPC can be applied to any process where the \\"conforming product\\" (product meeting specifications) output can be measured. Key tools used in SPC include run charts, control charts, a focus on continuous improvement, and the design of experiments. An example of a process where SPC is applied is manufacturing lines. SPC must be practised in 2 phases: The first phase is the initial establishment of the process, and the second phase is the regular production use of the process. In the second phase, a decision of the period to be examined must be made, depending upon the change in 5M&E; conditions (Man, Machine, Material, Method, Movement, Environment) and wear rate of parts used in the manufacturing process (machine parts, jigs, and fixtures). An advantage of SPC over other methods of quality control, such as \\"inspection\\", is that it emphasizes early detection and prevention of problems, rather than the correction of problems after they have occurred. In addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product. SPC makes it less likely the finished product will need to be reworked or scrapped.  History  SPC was pioneered by Walter A. Shewhart at Bell Laboratories in the early 1920s. Shewhart developed the control chart in 1924 and the concept of a state of statistical control. Statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeabilityBarlow & Irony (1992)Bergman (2009) developed by logician William Ernest Johnson also in 1924 in his book Logic, Part III: The Logical Foundations of Science.Zabell (1992) Along with a team at AT&T; that included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig he worked to put sampling inspection on a rational statistical basis as well. Shewhart consulted with Colonel Leslie E. Simon in the application of control charts to munitions manufacture at the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in 1934. That successful application helped convince Army Ordnance to engage AT&T;'s George Edwards to consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and contractors at the outbreak of World War II. W. Edwards Deming invited Shewhart to speak at the Graduate School of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and served as the editor of Shewhart's book Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control (1939) which was the result of that lecture. Deming was an important architect of the quality control short courses that trained American industry in the new techniques during WWII. The graduates of these wartime courses formed a new professional society in 1945, the American Society for Quality Control, which elected Edwards as its first president. Deming travelled to Japan during the Allied Occupation and met with the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) in an effort to introduce SPC methods to Japanese industry .Deming, W. Edwards, Lectures on statistical control of quality., Nippon Kagaku Gijutsu Remmei, 1950Deming, W. Edwards and Dowd S. John (translator) Lecture to Japanese Management, Deming Electronic Network Web Site, 1950 (from a Japanese transcript of a lecture by Deming to \\"80% of Japanese top management\\" given at the Hotel de Yama at Mr. Hakone in August 1950) ='Common' and 'special' sources of variation= Shewhart read the new statistical theories coming out of Britain, especially the work of William Sealy Gosset, Karl Pearson, and Ronald Fisher. However, he understood that data from physical processes seldom produced a normal distribution curve (that is, a Gaussian distribution or 'bell curve'). He discovered that data from measurements of variation in manufacturing did not always behave the way as data from measurements of natural phenomena (for example, Brownian motion of particles). Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display variation that is natural to the process (\\"common\\" sources of variation); these processes he described as being in (statistical) control. Other processes additionally display variation that is not present in the causal system of the process at all times (\\"special\\" sources of variation), which Shewhart described as not in control. =Application to non-manufacturing processes= In 1988, the Software Engineering Institute suggested that SPC could be applied to non-manufacturing processes, such as software engineering processes, in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The Level 4 and Level 5 practices of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) use this concept. The application of SPC to non-repetitive, knowledge-intensive processes, such as research and development or systems engineering, has encountered skepticism and remains controversial.Bob Raczynski and Bill Curtis (2008) Software Data Violate SPC's Underlying Assumptions, IEEE Software, May/June 2008, Vol. 25, No. 3, pp. 49-51Robert V. Binder (1997) Can a Manufacturing Quality Model Work for Software?, IEEE Software, September/October 1997, pp. 101-105 In his seminal article No Silver Bullet, Fred Brooks points out that the complexity, conformance requirements, changeability, and invisibility of softwareFred P. Brooks (1986) No Silver Bullet ‚Äî Essence and Accident in Software Engineering, Proceedings of the IFIP Tenth World Computing Conference 1986, pp. 1069‚Äì1076 results in inherent and essential variation that cannot be removed. This implies that SPC is less effective in the domain of software development than in, e.g., manufacturing. Variation in manufacturing In manufacturing, quality is defined as conformance to specification. However, no two products or characteristics are ever exactly the same, because any process contains many sources of variability. In mass-manufacturing, traditionally, the quality of a finished article is ensured by post-manufacturing inspection of the product. Each article (or a sample of articles from a production lot) may be accepted or rejected according to how well it meets its design specifications. In contras, SPC uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to detect significant variations before they result in the production of a sub-standard article. Any source of variation at any point of time in a process will fall into one of two classes. ;(1) Common causes: 'Common' causes are sometimes referred to as 'non-assignable', or 'normal' sources of variation. It refers to any source of variation that consistently acts on process, of which there are typically many. This type of causes collectively produce a statistically stable and repeatable distribution over time. ;(2) Special causes: 'Special' causes are sometimes referred to as 'assignable' sources of variation. The term refers to any factor causing variation that affects only some of the process output. They are often intermittent and unpredictable. Most processes have many sources of variation; most of them are minor and may be ignored. If the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected, potentially they can be identified and removed. When they are removed, the process is said to be 'stable'. When a process is stable, its variation should remain within a known set of limits. That is, at least, until another assignable source of variation occurs. For example, a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of cereal. Some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less. When the package weights are measured, the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights. If the production process, its inputs, or its environment (for example, the machine on the line) change, the distribution of the data will change. For example, as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear, the cereal filling machine may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box. Although this might benefit the customer, from the manufacturer's point of view it is wasteful, and increases the cost of production. If the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner, the change can be corrected (for example, the cams and pulleys replaced). Application The application of SPC involves three main phases of activity: #Understanding the process and the specification limits. #Eliminating assignable (special) sources of variation, so that the process is stable. #Monitoring the ongoing production process, assisted by the use of control charts, to detect significant changes of mean or variation. =Control charts= The data from measurements of variations at points on the process map is monitored using control charts. Control charts attempt to differentiate \\"assignable\\" (\\"special\\") sources of variation from \\"common\\" sources. \\"Common\\" sources, because they are an expected part of the process, are of much less concern to the manufacturer than \\"assignable\\" sources. Using control charts is a continuous activity, ongoing over time. Stable process When the process does not trigger any of the control chart \\"detection rules\\" for the control chart, it is said to be \\"stable\\". A process capability analysis may be performed on a stable process to predict the ability of the process to produce \\"conforming product\\" in the future. A stable process can be demonstrated by a process signature that is free of variances outside of the capability index. A process signature is the plotted points compared with the capability index. Excessive variations When the process triggers any of the control chart \\"detection rules\\", (or alternatively, the process capability is low), other activities may be performed to identify the source of the excessive variation. The tools used in these extra activities include: Ishikawa diagram, designed experiments, and Pareto charts. Designed experiments are a means of objectively quantifying the relative importance (strength) of sources of variation. Once the sources of (special cause) variation are identified, they can be minimized or eliminated. Steps to eliminating a source of variation might include: development of standards, staff training, error-proofing, and changes to the process itself or its inputs. Process stability metrics When monitoring many processes with control charts, it is sometimes useful to calculate quantitative measures of the stability of the processes. These metrics can then be used to identify/prioritize the processes that are most in need of corrective actions. These metrics can also be viewed as supplementing the traditional process capability metrics. Several metrics have been proposed, as described in Ramirez and Runger. They are (1) a Stability Ratio which compares the long-term variability to the short-term variability, (2) an ANOVA Test which compares the within-subgroup variation to the between- subgroup variation, and (3) an Instability Ratio which compares the number of subgroups that have one or more violations of the Western Electric rules to the total number of subgroups. Mathematics of control charts Digital control charts use logic-based rules that determine \\"derived values\\" which signal the need for correction. For example, :derived value = last value + average absolute difference between the last N numbers.

Origins of the phrase  The architect Louis Sullivan coined the maxim, although it is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor Horatio Greenough (18051852),Horatio Greenough, Form and Function: Remarks on Art, edited by Harold A. Small (Berkeley, Univ. of California Press, 1947), although the theory of inherent forms, of which the phrase is a loose summary, informs all of Greenough's writing on art, design, and architecture. Greenough was in his architectural writings influenced by the transcendentalist thinking and the Unitarian protestantism of Ralph Waldo Emerson. whose thinking mostly predates the later functionalist approach to architecture. Greenough's writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough. Sullivan was Greenough's much younger compatriot, and admired rationalist thinkers such as Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman, and Melville, as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered, though he later attributed the core idea to the Roman architect, engineer, and author Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, who first asserted in his book De architectura that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas ‚Äì that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful. Sullivan actually wrote \\"form ever follows function\\", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single \\"rule that shall permit of no exception\\". The full quote is: > Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, > the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding > stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form > ever follows function, and this is the law. Where function does not change, > form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for > ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. It is > the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things > physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of > all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the > life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. > This is the law. Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel skyscraper in late 19th-century Chicago at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, \\"form follows function\\", as opposed to \\"form follows precedent\\". Sullivan's assistant Frank Lloyd Wright adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form‚Äîperhaps because shaking off the old styles gave them more freedom and latitude.  Debate on the functionality of ornamentation  In 1908, the Austrian architect Adolf Loos wrote an allegorical essay titled \\"Ornament and Crime\\" in reaction to the elaborate ornament used by the Vienna Secession architects. Modernists adopted Loos's moralistic argument as well as Sullivan's maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.  Application in different fields  = Architecture = Home Building Association Bank by Sullivan The phrase \\"form (ever) follows function\\" became a battle cry of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call \\"ornament\\", were superfluous in modern buildings. However, Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush Art Nouveau and Celtic Revival decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature. = Product design = One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined Chrysler Airflow, when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a \\"teardrop\\" shape, which would not be good for unit sales.Jeffrey Meikle's \\"Twentieth Century Limited: Industrial Design in America, 1925 - 1939\\" General Motors adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, drag coefficient has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly. The American industrial designers of the 1930s and '40s like Raymond Loewy, Norman bel Geddes and Henry Dreyfuss grappled with the inherent contradictions of \\"form follows function\\" as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his \\"MAYA\\" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable) principle to express that product designs are bound by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising. By honestly applying \\"form follows function\\", industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business. Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding product differentiation. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements. (cf. planned obsolescence) From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary. Victor Papanek (died 1998) was an influential recent designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of \\"form follows function.\\" = Software engineering = It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact's requirements lead to roughly similar results. The principle can also be applied to enterprise application architectures of modern business where \\"function\\" is the Business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or \\"form\\". If the architecture dictates how the business operates then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility unable to adapt to change. Service-oriented architecture enables an enterprise architect to rearrange the \\"form\\" of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards based communication protocols which enable interoperability. Furthermore, domain-driven design postulates that structure (software architecture, design pattern, implementation) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain (functional requirement). While \\"form\\" and \\"function\\" may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, metaprogramming and the functional programming paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts. The agile software development movement espouses techniques such as 'test driven development' in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or 'form' emerges from actual function and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long term as well of as higher quality because of the functional base of automated tests. = Automobile designing = If the design of an automobile conforms to its function‚Äîfor instance the Fiat Multipla's shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows‚Äîthen its form is said to follow its function. = Evolution = According to Lamarck's long- discredited theory of evolution, anatomy will be structured according to functions associated with use; for instance, giraffes are taller to reach the leaves of trees. By contrast, in Darwinian evolution, form (variation) precedes function (as determined by selection). This is to say, in Lamarckian evolution the form is altered by the required function, whereas in Darwinian evolution small variations in form allow some parts of the population to function better, and are therefore more successful reproductively.

It is named after William Bell, a Master Mariner, who owned much of the property there since the 1840s. Many records wrongly accredit the locations name to John Calvert Bell of the family that took up a pastoral run there much later in 1905 and building the 'Addiscot' homestead. John Calvert Bell was, before that time, a resident at Calder Park, Mount Duneed, and not related to William Bell of Bells Beach. The beach and coastal reserve are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\\"Bells Beach Surfing Recreation Reserve (H2261)\\". Victorian Heritage Register. Heritage Victoria. Retrieved 2014-03-23. In the 2016 Census, there were 130 people in Bells Beach, 88.7% of whom were born in Australia and 94.5% of whom spoke only English at home. Surfing Bells Beach is the home of the world's longest continuously running pro surfing competition ‚Äì now known as the Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach. The event was formerly known as the Bells Easter Classic (among a variety of other titles). The competition was first held in January 1962 and then at Easter every year since although occasionally, when conditions at Bells aren't suitable, the competition has been transferred to other breaks such as Johanna and Woolamai. As early as 1939, surfers from Torquay made their way to Bells but access was a considerable problem until 1960, when Torquay surfers and Olympic wrestler Joe Sweeney hired a bulldozer and cleared a road along the Bells cliff Heritage Council of Victoria Annual Report 2003-04 from the Cobb & Co Road, where the concrete wave now stands, down to the beach. He charged one pound per surfer to recover his expenses. This is now part of the Surf Coast walking track. Nearby surf breaks include \\"Southside\\", \\"Centreside\\", \\"Rincon\\", \\"Winki Pop\\", (Uppers and Lowers), \\"Boobs\\" and \\"Steps\\". Although Bells is known internationally as one of the best breaks in Victoria, \\"Winki Pop\\" often works better under more diverse conditions than the other nearby breaks. The first \\"Surfboard Rally\\" at Bells Beach was organised by surfing pioneers Peter Troy and Vic Tantau to help promote sales of T Boards their own brand. Planned to run in December 1961 the event was postponed until 26 January 1962. From the following year the Australian Surf rider's Association - ASA (Victorian Branch) - Now called Surfing Victoria hosted and staged the annual surfing competition at Bells Beach held at Easter each year. The ASA also ran the conservation contest at Bells Beach which included tree planting in an effort to help preserve natural values every year since the mid-1970s. =Surfing competitions= * Rip Curl GromSearch National Series (under 17s) * Rip Curl Pro every Easter since 1962 =Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment (SANE)= In 1988 a group of local surfers who were concerned about the human impact that tourism was having on the Bells Beach Surfing Reserve started a group called Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment. Since 1988 they have met monthly to revegetate the reserve in an effort to bring it back to its original state. They have planted over 100,000 plants there to date. In popular culture Although the final scene of the film Point Break is set at Bells Beach, the scene was not filmed there. Bells Beach is a straight stretch and the beach in the film is a cove with spruce trees atop a hill. The actual location of the film was Indian Beach in Ecola State Park located in Cannon Beach, Oregon in the United States. Bells Beach is visited in the 1966 documentary film The Endless Summer. In the 2007 animation film Surf's Up, the Australian surfer is shown to be from Bells Beach.

More specifically, in Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built, meaning that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy. In particular, the geometric points do not have any length, area, volume or any other dimensional attribute. A common interpretation is that the concept of a point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space. Points in Euclidean geometry A finite set of points in two-dimensional Euclidean space. Points, considered within the framework of Euclidean geometry, are one of the most fundamental objects. Euclid originally defined the point as \\"that which has no part\\". In two-dimensional Euclidean space, a point is represented by an ordered pair (, ) of numbers, where the first number conventionally represents the horizontal and is often denoted by , and the second number conventionally represents the vertical and is often denoted by . This idea is easily generalized to three-dimensional Euclidean space, where a point is represented by an ordered triplet (, , ) with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by . Further generalizations are represented by an ordered tuplet of terms, where is the dimension of the space in which the point is located. Many constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an infinite collection of points that conform to certain axioms. This is usually represented by a set of points; As an example, a line is an infinite set of points of the form \\\\scriptstyle {L = \\\\lbrace (a_1,a_2,...a_n)a_1c_1 + a_2c_2 + ... a_nc_n = d \\\\rbrace}, where through and are constants and is the dimension of the space. Similar constructions exist that define the plane, line segment and other related concepts. A line segment consisting of only a single point is called a degenerate line segment. In addition to defining points and constructs related to points, Euclid also postulated a key idea about points, that any two points can be connected by a straight line. This is easily confirmed under modern extensions of Euclidean geometry, and had lasting consequences at its introduction, allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts known at the time. However, Euclid's postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive, and he occasionally assumed facts about points that did not follow directly from his axioms, such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points. In spite of this, modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions. Dimension of a point There are several inequivalent definitions of dimension in mathematics. In all of the common definitions, a point is 0-dimensional. = Vector space dimension = The dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a linearly independent subset. In a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector 0), there is no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent, because there is a non trivial linear combination making it zero: 1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{0}=\\\\mathbf{0}. =Topological dimension= The topological dimension of a topological space X is defined to be the minimum value of n, such that every finite open cover \\\\mathcal{A} of X admits a finite open cover \\\\mathcal{B} of X which refines \\\\mathcal{A} in which no point is included in more than n+1 elements. If no such minimal n exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension. A point is zero-dimensional with respect to the covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of a single open set. = Hausdorff dimension = Let X be a metric space. If S ‚äÇ X and d ‚àà [0, ‚àû), the d-dimensional Hausdorff content of S is the infimum of the set of numbers Œ¥ ‚â• 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of balls \\\\\\\\{B(x_i,r_i):i\\\\in I\\\\\\\\} covering S with ri > 0 for each i ‚àà I that satisfies \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} r_i^d<\\\\delta . The Hausdorff dimension of X is defined by :\\\\operatorname{dim}_{\\\\operatorname{H}}(X):=\\\\inf\\\\\\\\{d\\\\ge 0: C_H^d(X)=0\\\\\\\\}. A point has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily small radius. Geometry without points Although the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology, there are some systems that forgo it, e.g. noncommutative geometry and pointless topology. A \\"pointless\\" or \\"pointfree\\" space is defined not as a set, but via some structure (algebraic or logical respectively) which looks like a well-known function space on the set: an algebra of continuous functions or an algebra of sets respectively. More precisely, such structures generalize well-known spaces of functions in a way that the operation \\"take a value at this point\\" may not be defined. A further tradition starts from some books of A. N. Whitehead in which the notion of region is assumed as a primitive together with the one of inclusion or connection. Point masses and the Dirac delta function  Often in physics and mathematics, it is useful to think of a point as having non-zero mass or charge (this is especially common in classical electromagnetism, where electrons are idealized as points with non-zero charge). The Dirac delta function, or function, is (informally) a generalized function on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero, with an integral of one over the entire real line., p. 58 The delta function is sometimes thought of as an infinitely high, infinitely thin spike at the origin, with total area one under the spike, and physically represents an idealized point mass or point charge. It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac. In the context of signal processing it is often referred to as the unit impulse symbol (or function). Its discrete analog is the Kronecker delta function which is usually defined on a finite domain and takes values 0 and 1.

The BBC World Service is now housed in Broadcasting House in Portland Place. King's College London has taken over the premises since acquiring the lease in 2015.Jack Grove (2015) Ed Byrne: 'new address is a defining moment for king's college london'.

History The building was commissioned, designed and originally owned by American individuals and companies. Irving T. Bush gained approval for his plans for the building in 1919, which was conceived as a major new trade centre and designed by American architect Harvey Wiley Corbett. The construction was undertaken by John Mowlem & Co.Mowlem 1822 ‚Äì 1972, p. 6. Sections of Bush House were completed and opened over a period of 10 years: Centre Block was opened in 1925, North-West Wing in 1928, North-East Wing in 1929, South-East Wing in 1930, and South-West Wing in 1935. The full building complex was completed in 1935. The building's opening ceremony was performed by Lord Balfour, Lord President of the Council, on 4 July 1925. It included the unveiling of two statues at the entrance made by American artist Malvina Hoffman. The statues symbolise Anglo-American friendship and the building bears the inscription \\"To the friendship of English speaking peoples\\". Built from Portland stone, Bush House was in 1929 declared the \\"most expensive building in the world\\". = Headquarters of the BBC World Service = The BBC European Service moved into the South-East Wing of Bush House after bombs damaged Broadcasting House on 8 December 1940 during The Blitz. The move was completed in 1941 and the BBC Overseas Service followed in 1958. The BBC World Service occupied four wings of the building. In 1944 Bush House suffered external damage from a V-1 flying bomb. The North-West Wing was formerly occupied by BBC Online until they relocated to the BBC Media Village in 2005, with some studio and office space being retained until 2008. The BBC also moved its World Service to Broadcasting House. The final broadcast from Bush was on 12 July 2012. Bulletins now come from Broadcasting House. The BBC's lease expired at the end of 2012. = King's College London campus = A full refurbishment of Bush House and its adjoining wings was undertaken by John Robertson Architects following the BBC's vacation. Bush House, along with North-East Wing, South-East Wing and Melbourne House were stripped back to CAT A and fully modernised whilst retaining original period features. The intended use was open plan offices with reception spaces for each of the buildings given an individual identity. The courtyard was to remain as a car park/delivery point. Completion of this work transpired in June 2014 as part of the much-marketed Aldwych Quarter. On 10 March 2015, King's College London announced it had acquired a 50-year lease for the Aldwych Quarter. as a substantial part of its expansion of its Strand Campus John Robertson Architects undertook the interior fit-out to convert Aldwych Quarter into a fully operational, modern university campus, including installation of a 400 seat auditorium, lecture theatres, seminar rooms, academic offices and a health centre. The courtyard has been converted from car parking to semi- public realm and features a new glass pavilion offering access to the Students' Union and undercroft joining the building's wings together. Since its foundation on 1 August 2017, the King's Business School has been located inside Bush House.

This thumbnail image is downsized and does not show the technique. Click to see the full-size image. Subpixel rendering is a way to increase the apparent resolution of a computer's liquid crystal display (LCD) or organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display by rendering pixels to take into account the screen type's physical properties. It takes advantage of the fact that each pixel on a color LCD is actually composed of individual red, green, and blue or other color subpixels to anti- alias text with greater detail or to increase the resolution of all image types on layouts which are specifically designed to be compatible with subpixel rendering. Background Examples of pixel geometry, showing various arrangements of pixels and subpixels, which must be considered for subpixel rendering. LCD displays (bottom right is the most typical example) are best suited to subpixel rendering. \\"Aa\\" rendered in subpixel. The previous image, with the , and channel separated and animated. A single pixel on a color subpixelated display is made of several color primaries, typically three colored elements‚Äîordered (on various displays) either as blue, green, and red (), or as red, green, and blue (). Some displays have more than three primaries, often called MultiPrimary, such as the combination of red, green, blue, and yellow (), or red, green, blue and white (W), or even red, green, blue, yellow, and cyan (). These pixel components, sometimes called subpixels, appear as a single color to the human eye because of blurring by the optics and spatial integration by nerve cells in the eye. The components are easily visible, however, when viewed with a small magnifying glass, such as a loupe. Over a certain resolution threshold the colors in the subpixels are not visible, but the relative intensity of the components shifts the apparent position or orientation of a line. Subpixel rendering is better suited to some display technologies than others. The technology is well-suited to LCDs and other technologies where each logical pixel corresponds directly to three or more independent colored subpixels, but less so for CRTs. In a CRT the light from the pixel components often spreads across pixels, and the outputs of adjacent pixels are not perfectly independent. If a designer knew precisely about the display's electron beams and aperture grille, subpixel rendering might have some advantage but the properties of the CRT components, coupled with the alignment variations that are part of the production process, make subpixel rendering less effective for these displays. The technique should have good application to organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and other display technologies that organize pixels the same way as LCDs. Pixels on an LCD are made up of separate red, green, and blue elements, which can be used to give finer control over rendering the curvature of text. The word would appear white on the screen because red, green, and blue light combined are indistinguishable from white light to the human visual system. History and patents The origin of subpixel rendering as used today remains controversial. Apple, then IBM, and finally Microsoft patented various implementations with certain technical differences owing to the different purposes their technologies were intended for.John Markoff, \\"Microsoft's Cleartype Sets Off Debate on Originality\\", New York Times, December 7, 1998 Microsoft has several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between October 7, 1998, and October 7, 1999, thus should expire on October 7, 2019. Analysis by FreeType of the patent indicates that the idea of subpixel rendering is not covered by the patent, but the actual filter used as a last step to balance the color is. However Microsoft's patent describes the smallest filter possible that distributes each subpixel value to an equal amount of R,G, and B pixels. Any other filter will either be blurrier or will introduce color artifacts. It has been proposed for open source to use a \\"2-pixel\\" subpixel rendering, where G is one subpixel, and the R and B of two adjacent pixels are combined into a \\"purple subpixel\\", to avoid the Microsoft patent. This has the claimed advantage of a more equal perceived brightness of the two subpixels, somewhat easier power-of-2 math, and a sharper filter. However it only produces 2/3 the resulting resolution. Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement. =Apple II= It is sometimes claimed (such as by Steve Gibson) that the Apple II, introduced in 1977, supports an early form of subpixel rendering in its high-resolution (280√ó192) graphics mode. However, the method Gibson describes can also be viewed as a limitation of the way the machine generates color, rather than as a technique intentionally exploited by programmers to increase resolution. David Turner of the FreeType project criticized Gibson's theory as to the invention, at least as far as patent law is concerned, in the following way: ¬´For the record, the Wozniak patent is referenced in the [Microsoft ], and the claims are worded precisely to avoid colliding with it (which is easy, since the Apple II only used 2 \\"sub-pixels\\", instead of the 'at minimum 3' claimed by MS).¬ªDavid Turner (24 Sep 20:00 2006) LCD Rendering Patches (was Re: [ft] Regression in rendering quality with subpixel antialiasing) Turner further explains his view: The bytes that comprise the Apple II high-resolution screen buffer contain seven visible bits (each corresponding directly to a pixel) and a flag bit used to select between purple/green or blue/orange color sets. Each pixel, since it is represented by a single bit, is either on or off; there are no bits within the pixel itself for specifying color or brightness. Color is instead created as an artifact of the NTSC color encoding scheme, determined by horizontal position: pixels with even horizontal coordinates are always purple (or blue, if the flag bit is set), and odd pixels are always green (or orange). Two lit pixels next to each other are always white, regardless of whether the pair is even/odd or odd/even, and irrespective of the value of the flag bit. The foregoing is only an approximation of the true interplay of the digital and analog behavior of the Apple's video output circuits on one hand, and the properties of real NTSC monitors on the other hand. However, this approximation is what most programmers of the time would have in mind while working with the Apple's high-resolution mode. Gibson's example claims that because two adjacent bits make a white block, there are in fact two bits per pixel: one which activates the purple left half of the pixel, and the other which activates the green right half of the pixel. If the programmer instead activates the green right half of a pixel and the purple left half of the next pixel, then the result is a white block that is 1/2 pixel to the right, which is indeed an instance of subpixel rendering. However, it is not clear whether any programmers of the Apple II have considered the pairs of bits as pixels‚Äîinstead calling each bit a pixel. While the quote from Apple II inventor Steve Wozniak on Gibson's page seems to imply that vintage Apple II graphics programmers routinely used subpixel rendering, it is difficult to make a case that many of them thought of what they were doing in such terms. The flag bit in each byte affects color by shifting pixels half a pixel-width to the right. This half-pixel shift was exploited by some graphics software, such as HRCG (High-Resolution Character Generator), an Apple utility that displayed text using the high-resolution graphics mode, to smooth diagonals. (Many Apple II users had monochrome displays, or turned down the saturation on their color displays when running software that expected a monochrome display, so this technique was useful.) Although it did not provide a way to address subpixels individually, it did allow positioning of pixels at fractional pixel locations and can thus be considered a form of subpixel rendering. However, this technique is not related to LCD subpixel rendering as described in this article. =IBM= =ClearType= Microsoft announced its subpixel rendering technology, called ClearType, at COMDEX in 1998; it was then made available in Windows XP, but it was not activated by default until Windows Vista. (Windows XP OEMs however could and did change the default setting.)Greg Hitchcock (with introduction by Steven Sinofsky) \\"Engineering Changes to ClearType in Windows 7 \\", MSDN blogs, June 23, 2009 =FreeType= FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, contains two open source implementations. The original implementation uses the ClearType antialiasing filters and it carries the following notice: \\"The colour filtering algorithm of Microsoft's ClearType technology for subpixel rendering is covered by patents; for this reason the corresponding code in FreeType is disabled by default. Note that subpixel rendering per se is prior art; using a different colour filter thus easily circumvents Microsoft's patent claims.\\" Since version 2.8.1, a second implementation exists, called Harmony, that \\"offers high quality LCD-optimized output without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution tripling and filtering\\". This is the method enabled by default. When using this method, \\"each color channel is generated separately after shifting the glyph outline, capitalizing on the fact that the color grids on LCD panels are shifted by a third of a pixel. This output is indistinguishable from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.\\" Since the Harmony method does not require additional filtering, it is not covered by the ClearType patents. =SubLCD= SubLCD is another open source subpixel rendering method that claims it does not infringe existing patents, and promises to remain unpatented. David Turner was however skeptical of SubLCD's author's claims: \\"Unfortunately, I, as the FreeType author, do not share his enthusiasm. The reason is precisely the very vague patent claims [by Microsoft] described previously. To me, there is a non- negligible (even if small) chance, that these claims also cover the SubLCD technique. The situation would probably be different if we could invalidate the broader patent claims, but this is not the case currently.\\" =CoolType= Adobe built their own subpixel renderer called CoolType, so they could display documents the same way across various operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux etc. When it was launched around the year 2001, CoolType supported a wider range of fonts than Microsoft's ClearType, which was then limited to TrueType fonts, whereas Adobe's CoolType also supported PostScript fonts (and their OpenType equivalent as well).Felici, James (April 2000) \\"ClearType, CoolType: The Eyes Have It\\", Seybold Report on Internet Publishing, Vol. 4 Issue 8 = OS X = Mac OS X uses subpixel rendering as well, as part of Quartz 2D. Unlike's Microsoft's implementation, which favors a tight fit to the grid to maximize legibility, Apple's implementation prioritizes the shape of the glyphs as set out by their designer.  PenTile  Starting in 1992, Candice H. Brown Elliott researched subpixel rendering and novel layouts, the PenTile matrix family pixel layout, which worked together with sub pixel rendering algorithms to raise the resolution of color flat-panel displays.Brown Elliott, C.H., \\"Reducing Pixel Count without Reducing Image Quality\\" , Information Display Magazine, December 1999, ISSN 0362-0972 In 2000, she co-founded Clairvoyante, Inc. to commercialize these layouts and subpixel rendering algorithms. In 2008, Samsung purchased Clairvoyante and simultaneously funded a new company, Nouvoyance, Inc., retaining much of the technical staff, with Ms. Brown Elliott as CEO. With subpixel rendering technology, the number of points that may be independently addressed to reconstruct the image is increased. When the green subpixels are reconstructing the shoulders, the red subpixels are reconstructing near the peaks and vice versa. For text fonts, increasing the addressability allows the font designer to use spatial frequencies and phases that would have created noticeable distortions had it been whole pixel rendered. The improvement is most noted on italic fonts which exhibit different phases on each row. This reduction in moir√© distortion is the primary benefit of subpixel rendered fonts on the conventional Stripe panel. Although subpixel rendering increases the number of reconstruction points on the display this does not always mean that higher resolution, higher spatial frequencies, more lines and spaces, may be displayed on a given arrangement of color subpixels. A phenomenon occurs as the spatial frequency is increased past the whole pixel Nyquist limit from the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem; Chromatic aliasing (color fringes) may appear with higher spatial frequencies in a given orientation on the color subpixel arrangement. =Example with the common stripes layout= For example, consider an Stripe Panel: WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW = red is WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW = green perceived WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW where = blue as WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW W = white WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW Shown below is an example of black and white lines at the Nyquist limit, but at a slanting angle, taking advantage of subpixel rendering to use a different phase each row: _ WWW_WWW_WWW_ = red _ is _WWW_WWW_WWW = green _ perceived WWW_WWW_WWW_ where = blue _ as _WWW_WWW_WWW _ = black  WWW_WWW_WW W = white Shown below is an example of chromatic aliasing when the traditional whole pixel Nyquist limit is exceeded:   = red = yellow  is  = green = cyan  perceived  where = blue = magenta  as  _ = black   This case shows the result of attempting to place vertical black and white lines at four subpixels per cycle on the Stripe architecture. One can visually see that the lines, instead of being white, are colored. Starting from the left, the first line is red combined with green to produce a yellow-colored line. The second line is green combined with blue to produce a pastel cyan-colored line. The third line is blue combined with red to produce a magenta-colored line. The colors then repeat: yellow, cyan, and magenta. This demonstrates that a spatial frequency of one cycle per four subpixels is too high. Attempts to go to a yet higher spatial frequency, such as one cycle per three subpixels, would result in a single solid color. Some LCDs compensate the inter-pixel color mix effect by having borders between pixels slightly larger than borders between subpixels. Then, in the example above, a viewer of such an LCD would see a blue line appearing adjacent to a red line instead of a single magenta line. =Example with - alternated stripes layout= Novel subpixel layouts have been developed to allow higher real resolution without chromatic aliasing. Shown here is one of the member of the PenTile matrix family of layouts. Shown below is an example of how a simple change to the arrangement of color subpixels may allow a higher limit in the horizontal direction: PenTile - alternated subpixel geometry (zoomed at 12:1). In this case, the red and green order are interchanged every row to create a red & green checkerboard pattern with blue stripes. Note that the vertical subpixels could be split in half vertically to double the vertical resolution as well : the current LCD panels already typically use two color LEDs (aligned vertically and displaying the same lightness, see the zoomed images below) to illuminate each vertical subpixel. This layout is one of the PenTile matrix family of layouts. When displaying the same number of black-white lines, the blue subpixels are set at half brightness \\"\\":       Notice that every column that turns on comprises red and green subpixels at full brightness and blue subpixels at half value to balance it to white. Now, one may display black and white lines at up to one cycle per three subpixels without chromatic aliasing, twice that of the Stripe architecture. =Non-striped variants of the - alternated layout= PenTile -- alternated subpixel geometry (zoomed at 12:1). Variants of the previous layout have been proposed by Clairvoyante/Nouvoyance (and demonstrated by Samsung) as members of the PenTile matrix family of layouts specifically designed for subpixel rendering efficiency. For example, taking advantage of the doubled visible horizontal resolution, one could double the vertical resolution to make the definition more isotropic. However this would reduce the aperture of pixels, producing lower contrasts. A better alternative uses the fact that the blue subpixels are those that contribute the least to the visible intensity, so that they are less precisely located by the eye. Blue subpixels are then rendered just as a diamond in the center of a pixel square, and the rest of the pixel surface is split in four parts as a checker board of red and green subpixels with smaller sizes. Rendering images with this variant can use the same technique as before, except that now there's a near-isotropic geometry that supports both the horizontal and the vertical with the same geometric properties, making the layout ideal for displaying the same image details when the LCD panel can be rotated. The doubled vertical and horizontal visual resolution allows to reduce the subpixel density of about 33%, in order to increase their aperture also of about 33%, with the same separation distance between subpixels (for their electronic interconnection), and also to reduce the power dissipation of about 50% with a white/black contrast increased of about 50% and still a visual-pixel resolution enhanced by about 33% (i.e. about 125 dpi instead of 96 dpi), but with only half the total number of subpixels for the same displayed surface. =Checkered -W layout= Another variant, called the W Quad, uses a checkerboard with 4 subpixels per pixel, adding a white subpixel, or more specifically, replacing one of the green subpixels of Bayer filter Pattern with a white subpixel, to increase the contrast and reduce the energy needed to illuminate white pixels (because color filters in classic striped panels absorb more than 65% of the total white light used to illuminate the panel). As each subpixel is a square instead of a thin rectangle, this also increases the aperture with the same average subpixel density, and same pixel density along both axis. As the horizontal density is reduced and the vertical density remains identical (for the same square pixel density), it becomes possible to increase the pixel density of about 33%, while maintaining the contrast comparable to classic or panels, taking profit of the more efficient use of light and lowered absorption levels by the color filters. It is not possible to use subpixel rendering to increase the resolution without creating color fringes similar to those seen in classic or striped panels, but the increased resolution compensates it, in addition, their effective visible color is reduced by the presence of \\"color-neutral\\" white subpixels. However, this layout allows a better rendering of greys, at the price of a lower color separation. But this is consistent with human vision and with modern image and video compression formats (like JPEG and MPEG) used in modern HDTV transmissions and in Blu-ray Discs. Yet another variant, a member for the PenTile matrix family of subpixel layouts, alternates between subpixel order W / W every other row, to allow subpixel rendering to increase the resolution, without chromatic aliasing. As before, the increased transmittance using the white subpixel allows higher subpixel density, but in this case, the displayed resolution is even higher due to the benefits of subpixel rendering: WWW WWW WWW WWW _ _W_W_W _ _W_W_W =Visual resolution versus pixel resolution and software compatibility= Thus, not all layouts are created equal. Each particular layout may have a different \\"visual resolution\\", modulation transfer function limit (MTFL), defined as the highest number of black and white lines that may be simultaneously rendered without visible chromatic aliasing. However, such alternate layouts are still not compatible with subpixel rendering font algorithms used in Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, which currently support only the or horizontal striped subpixel layouts (rotated monitor subpixel rendering is not supported on Windows or Mac OS X, but Linux does for most desktop environments). However, the PenTile matrix displays have a built-in subpixel rendering engine that allows conventional data sets to be converted to the layouts, providing plug'n'play compatibility with conventional layout displays. New display models should be proposed in the future that will allow monitor drivers to specify their visual resolution separately from the full pixel resolution and the relative position offsets of visible subpixels for each color plane, as well as their respective contribution to white intensity. Such monitor drivers would allow renderers to correctly adjust their geometry transform matrices in order to correctly compute the values of each color plane, and take the best profit of subpixel rendering with the lowest chromatic aliasing. Examples Photos were taken with a Canon PowerShot A470 digital camera using \\"Super Macro\\" mode and 4.0√ó digital zoom. The screen used was that integrated into a Lenovo G550 laptop. Note that the display has RGB pixels. Displays exist in all four patterns horizontal RGB/BGR and vertical RGB/BGR but horizontal RGB is the most common. In addition, several color subpixel patterns have been developed specifically to take advantage of subpixel rendering. The best known of these is the PenTile matrix family of patterns.

It provides the major road link between southeastern Queensland and Victoria via central NSW and as such carries large amounts of freight. At in length, the Newell is the longest highway in NSW, and passes through fifteen local government areas. The highway is part of Australian national route 39 and was signposted accordingly until 2013. Since then it has been signposted as NSW route A39. Traffic volumes along the Newell Highway vary from around 1,200 to 4,000 vehicles per day in rural areas. In Dubbo, the largest urban centre through which the highway passes, average daily traffic volumes are in the order of 20,000 vehicles a day. Many heavy vehicles use the Newell Highway ‚Äì between 26 per cent and 52 per cent of all traffic, depending on the point along the highway. At one point in the Riverina region of NSW, the highway carries approximately 1,900 vehicles daily, of which about 32 per cent is heavy vehicles; while at another point in the north of the state, which carries the largest number of heavy vehicles, on average a truck passes every 60 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The highway is named in honour of H. H. Newell, the first Commissioner for Main Roads in New South Wales (1932-1941). It carries NSW route A39 signage for its entire length. Other than short four-lane lengths within some of the urban areas through which it passes, the Newell Highway is a single carriageway, two-lane road, although there are many overtaking lanes, with further overtaking lanes under construction up until 2021 (see Newell Highway Alliance Program\\" www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/newell-highway/program-alliance/index.html) The speed limit on most rural sections of the highway is . Route The terrain that the highway traverses is generally flat to gently undulating, with long, straight sections joined by the occasional curved section. However, passing through the Warrumbungle Range, there are steeper grades and tighter curves than on the rest of the highway. The highway runs generally north‚Äìsouth, parallel to the coast of NSW, about inland, and is the most direct road link from Victoria to southeastern Queensland, bypassing the more urbanised and congested coastal areas of the state, and in doing so avoiding the difficult coastal topography traversed by the Pacific Highway. From its northern terminus at Goondiwindi on the Queensland-NSW border, where it meets the Cunningham and Leichhardt Highways, and forms the southward extension of the Cunningham Highway from Warwick and Brisbane, the Newell runs south across the Queensland-New South Wales border through Boggabilla, Moree, Narrabri, Coonabarabran, Gilgandra, Dubbo, Parkes, Forbes, West Wyalong, Narrandera, Jerilderie, and . Its southern terminus is where it crosses the Murray River (part of the border between New South Wales and Victoria) at Tocumwal and meets the Goulburn Valley Highway in Victoria. The Goulburn Valley Highway forms the next section of national route 39 south towards Melbourne via Shepparton and Seymour, where it joins the Hume Highway. The Newell intersect the following highways: Bruxner (at Boggabilla), Carnarvon and Gwydir (at Moree), Kamilaroi (at Narrabri), Oxley (east) (north of Coonabarabran), Castlereagh and Oxley (west) (at Gilgandra), Golden and Mitchell (at Dubbo), Mid-Western (east) at Marsden), Mid-Western (west) at West Wyalong), Sturt (at Gillenbah) and Riverina (at Finley). The Newell Highway is located entirely west of the Great Dividing Range, running largely along the foot of the western slopes of the range, and as such crosses nine major rivers, all west- flowing from the Great Dividing Range. From north to south these rivers are the Macintyre (at Goondiwindi), the Gwydir (10 km north of Moree), the Mehi (at Moree), the Namoi (near Narrabri), the Castlereagh (at Coonabarabran and again at Gilgandra), the Macquarie (at Dubbo), the Lachlan (at Forbes), the Murrumbidgee (at Narrandera), and the Murray (at Tocumwal). Some sections of the Newell Highway are subject to periodic flooding from these rivers, particularly north of Moree, at Dubbo, and south of Narrandera. Naming and numbering The route now known as the Newell Highway was proclaimed as State Highway 17 in July 1938, and in July 1941 named in honour of H. H. Newell (Commissioner for Main Roads 1932-1941) following his death in office. At the time of the gazettal of state highway 17, it followed existing roads as far as possible, but between Coonabarabran and Narrabri and between Narrandera and West Wyalong no road existed. The section through the Pilliga Scrub between Coonabarabran and Narrabri was constructed during 1941-42 as a wartime defence project, and the section between Narrandera and West Wyalong was constructed in 1946‚Äì49. In 1952 the ultimate gazetted route of the highway between Narrandera and West Wyalong was altered from its original 1938 gazetted route. Under the original national road numbering scheme in 1954, national route 39 was to run from the Hume Highway (national route 30, subsequently changed to 31) at Seymour, via Shepparton Tocumwal, Finley, Narrandera, West Wyalong, Forbes, Parkes, Dubbo, Gilgandra, Coonabarabran, Narrabri, Moree, Goondiwindi, Moonie, Miles and Banana to Rockhampton, to connect with the Bruce Highway (national route 1). Consequently, the Newell Highway, as part of this route, was signposted in 1965 with the standard black and white national route markers. On 15 January 1993, following the passage of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the Australian Government assumed financial responsibility from the NSW government for the upkeep and improvement of the Newell Highway. It also assumed responsibility for the onward connectors from either end of the Newell Highway - the Goulburn Valley Highway in Victoria and the Cunningham Highway in Queensland. The black and white national route shields were then replaced with green and gold shields (signifying that the highway is a nationally rather than state-funded route). These in turn were replaced in 2013 by the alpha-numerical shields of the NSW state-based numbering system. Some sections of the route of the Newell Highway are shared with the routes of other highways. From north to south these are the Gwydir at Moree, the Kamilaroi at Narrabri, the Oxley (from 10 km north of Coonabarabran to Gilgandra), the Castlereagh through Gilgandra, the Mid-Western between Marsden and West Wyalong, and the Riverina (185 m through Finley). Route development Completion of the sealing of the full length of the highway occurred in 1972. Town centre bypasses have been provided in Moree, Dubbo, Parkes and West Wyalong (heavy vehicle route). A town bypass at Ardlethan has also been constructed.

A color of 28 pitches is arranged with a talea of four durations which repeats seven times (28 √∑ 4 = 7). Isorhythm (from the Greek for \\"the same rhythm\\") is a musical technique using a repeating rhythmic pattern, called a talea, in at least one voice part throughout a composition. Taleae are typically applied to one or more melodic patterns of pitches or colores, which may be of the same or a different length from the talea. History and development Isorhythms first appear in French motets of the 13th century, such as in the Montpellier Codex . Although 14th-century theorists used the words talea and color‚Äîthe latter in a variety of senses related to repetition and embellishment ‚Äîthe term \\"isorhythm\\" was not coined until 1904 by musicologist Friedrich Ludwig (1872‚Äì1930), initially to describe the practice in 13th-century polyphony. Ludwig later extended its use to the 14th-century music of Guillaume de Machaut. Subsequently, Heinrich Besseler and other musicologists expanded its scope further as an organizing structural element in 14th- and early 15th- century compositions‚Äîin particular, motets (; ). Some of the earliest works organized around isorhythms are early 14th-century motets by various composers in an illuminated manuscript of the Roman de Fauvel. Two of the era's most important composers of isorhythmic motets are Phillipe de Vitry (1291‚Äì1361) and Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300‚Äì1377) . Machaut's Motet No. 2, De souspirant/Tous corps qui de bien amer/Suspiro, is an example of typical 14th- century use of isorhythm . Isorhythm is a logical outgrowth of the rhythmic modes that governed most late medieval polyphony. Discarding modal-rhythmic limitations, isorhythm became a significant organizing principle of much of 14th-century French polyphony by extending the talea of an initial section to the entire composition in conjunction with variation of a corresponding color . \\"The playful complexity of ....[taleae] that mixes mensuration and undergoes diminution by half‚Äîbecame a typical, even a defining feature of motets in the 14th century and beyond\\" . Structural diagram of the isorhythmic tenor in Johannes Alanus' Sub arturo plebs ‚Äì Fons citharizantium ‚Äì In omnem terram. The structural diagram at right shows the isorhythmic tenor voice of a late 14th- century motet, Sub arturo plebs ‚Äì Fons citharizantium ‚Äì In omnem terram by Johannes Alanus (c. late 14th century), featuring threefold isorhythmic diminution. First staff: preexisting Gregorian cantus firmus melody, from the first antiphon for the first nocturn of the commons for Apostles, In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum ('their voice has gone out into all the world'). The cantus firmus of the motet is a perfect fifth higher than the original chant; notes used for the tenor marked in red. Second staff: isorhythmic tenor as notated in mensural notation. Numbers 1‚Äì3 and brackets indicate three rhythmically identical sequences (taleae). The three mensuration signs in the beginning define the pattern of diminution, indicating tempus perfectum cum prolatio maior, tempus perfectum cum prolatio minor and tempus imperfectum cum prolatio minor, respectively. (In the manuscript these signs are in fact found at the end of the line, together with a repetition sign.) Staves 2‚Äì5: abbreviated transcription into modern notation. Each line represents one full repetition of the tenor's melody (color), including the three taleae in each, resulting in a nine-part structure. (Within each color, only the first few notes of each talea are rendered here.) The three mensuration signs in the line above correspond to the change in time signatures: , , . During the decades following and into the 15th century, upper voices became increasingly involved in isorhythmic organization. Many compositions became isorhythmic in all voices, a practice known as panisorhythm. In such compositions, the length of the \\"color\\" and \\"talea\\" are often unequal, causing the repetition of the melody in differing rhythmic patterns. As an example, if the \\"color\\" includes nine notes and the \\"talea\\" five, the \\"color\\" would have to be repeated five times before the two schemes again realign. Examples can be found in motets and Mass movements by John Dunstable, Johannes Ciconia and Guillaume Du Fay . A 15th-century Mass by a composer known only as Pycard found in the Old Hall manuscript (named for the English town in which it was eventually discovered), demonstrates the high sophistication and complexity of panisorhythmic techniques. The lower parts have a recurring color and talea that unite the composition. The upper parts have four different talea, one for each major section of the composition. The rhythmic relationship between upper and lower parts changes as the music progresses. Each quarter note in the lower part equals 4¬Ω quarter notes in the upper parts, creating an uneven ratio of 4:9 that causes the parts to lose synchronization. The lower part then steadily contracts in a series of Pythagorean proportions (12:9:8:6) until the parts come back into alignment . As an analytical concept, isorhythm has proven valuable for understanding musical practices in other cultures; for example, the peyote cult songs of certain North American Indian groups and the music of India and Africa .

The island is 10 km in length, 2 km wide and consists of a large lagoonal reef system along its leeward side, with 28 small islets along its coast. In 1999, the waters within three nautical miles of Lord Howe Island (465.45 km2) were declared a marine park under the NSW Marine Park Act 1997 to protect its unique marine biodiversity, with the park currently being managed by the New South Wales Marine Parks Authority. Both Lord Howe Island and Balls Pyramid are incorporated within the three nautical miles protected by the state marine park. Both marine parks complement the island's status as a World Heritage Site. Lord Howe Island is located approximately northeast of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Lord Howe Island is remote, has a biologically diverse marine system with a high degree of endemism. Lord Howe Island Marine Park was declared after it was recognised as an area with outstanding natural values, an extraordinary array of marine habitats and biodiversity, rich maritime cultural heritage and social and economic importance to the island community, giving it both national and international importance.  History of management  = Establishment of the Marine Park = The marine park was declared on 26 February 1999 under the Marine Parks Act 1997, with a zoning plan commencing on 1 December 2004 to protect the important natural and cultural values of the park while providing a range of sustainable uses. Due to its isolated geographic location, small size and limited access, there are a number of threats to biodiversity that require management. The marine park status helps protect marine biodiversity from fishing pressure and population pressure. A range of scientific, social, cultural and economic information was collated to design the zoning plan. In August 2001 an Issues Paper was released for public comment and submissions reviewed. In June 2002, a draft zoning plan document was established outlining a number of options for zoning, incorporating the submissions gained through the public comment period, advice taken from the Lord Howe Island Marine Park Advisory Committee and a review of relevant information. This plan was released for public comment in December 2003 with a finalised zoning plan and implementation of marine park zones commencing on 1 December 2004. The waters from 3 - 12 nautical miles were declared a federal marine park on 21 June 2000, see Lord Howe Island Marine Park (Commonwealth waters). = Management practices = In 1999, the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) was brought in. The EPBC Act provides guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities through the implementation of the marine bioregional planning process. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment. This process identified the regional conservation priorities in a number of different marine regions and identified the marine reserves to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Lord Howe Island Marine park was identified as requiring protection. To protect the various marine conservation values associated with the waters around Lord Howe Island, the New South Wales government proclaimed the Lord Howe Island Marine Park in 1999. However, it wasn't until 2004 that a zoning scheme came into force due to lengthy negotiations with stakeholders. This zoning scheme partitioned the coastal waters of Lord Howe Island to permit different human uses, in order to minimise the threat to marine conservation values. The objectives of the zoning plan under the Marine Parks Act 1997 include: 1) to conserve marine biological diversity and marine habitats, 2) to maintain ecological processes, 3) where consistent with the preceding, to provide for ecologically sustainable use of fish and marine vegetation, and 4) to provide opportunities for public appreciation, understanding and enjoyment. The zoning plan for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park provides various levels of biodiversity protection, regulating activities according to zones. 73.2% of the Marine Park, known as Habitat Protection Zones, allows most forms of fishing: charter boat and recreational, but excludes spearfishing. The other 26.8% of the Marine Park are zoned as seven Sanctuary Zones, where fishing, anchoring and other harmful human activities are excluded. While 0.004% (1.7ha) of the marine park is considered a Special Purpose Zone used for special management needs, specifically to allow limited fish feeding. Lord Howe Island Marine park does not contain any General Use zones, like other Marine Parks in New South Wales. The zoning plan also contains regulations on specific activities and provides additional protection on species of particular importance. The zoning plan gives protection to important natural and cultural values of the marine park, while allowing sustainable use including swimming, surfing, charter and recreational fishing, scuba diving, sailing, boating and research. Visitor numbers are restricted on the island to control impacts to the Marine Park.  Climate  Lord Howe Island has a temperate climate, with mean water temperatures of 25 ¬∞C in summer and 18 ¬∞C in winter. Annual rainfall is 1650mm in the lowland parts of the island. Lord Howe Island's climate is moderated by oceanic air currents and mild sea temperatures. The island can be windy as the salt laden wind comes predominantly from the southeast and northeast and the mean wind speed is highest in late winter and spring.  Biodiversity values  = Geomorphology = Lord Howe Island is regarded as having high geological, geomorphological and geodiversity values, many of which extend to the habitats of the marine park. Lord Howe Island is situated at the southernmost limit of coral reef formation, receiving both tropical and temperate open ocean carbon environments. Slowly, over time Lord Howe Island is moving into reef forming seas due to the northward migration of Australia's tectonic plate, which is moving 5‚Äì6 cm north per year. A white sedimentary rock known as calcarenite is locally important within the marine park as it makes up the central and northern regions of the island to below sea level in several places. Calcarenite is formed through the cementing of calcareous algae, coral fragments and sand. Dating has indicated that calcarenite was deposited in the past 350,000 years during the Pleistocene period. The beach and shallow-water calcarenites indicate a sea level around 2-3m above the present level during the last interglacial period (130,000-70,000 years ago, Pleistocene). Little evidence of reefs during this time can be seen as they may have occupied locations similar to those of modern reefs or were largely destroyed following emergence once the sea level fell. The fringing reef on the windward western coastline of Lord Howe Island absorbs wave energy and acts as a breakwater preventing storm surges from eroding the low lying central region of the island. The sheltered lagoon contains a number of different reef habitats, dominated by sand, lagoonal corals, gravel sheets, algal flats and patch reefs. = Ecology = The high conservation significance of Lord Howe Island and its waters is recognised by its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982. Conservation values relating to the marine park include the unique combination of tropical and temperature reef taxa, both flora and fauna. These unique taxa include a number of species at the limits of their distribution, reflecting the extreme latitude of the coral reef ecosystem, making Lord Howe Island Marine Park the southernmost true coral reef in the world. Lord Howe Island Marine Park is also home to a high diversity of marine benthic algae, fishes and marine invertebrates and is associated with high levels of endemicity. Lord Howe Island was only discovered by humans in 1778, consequently the original flora and fauna has remained relatively untouched.  Flora  Three distinct marine habitat community types have been identified within the Marine Park: coral reefs, macroalgal beds, and offshore/open coast communities. The distribution of these depends on wave exposure. The Lord Howe Island Group supports more than 305 benthic algae species, including 47 endemic species. Hence, approximately 15% of the benthic algal species are endemic to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park. Also, two species of non-endemic sea grasses are found within the marine park: Eelgrass, Zostera muelleri subsp capricorni and Paddleweed, Halophila ovalis.  Fauna  Providence Petrel, a Lord Howe Island seabird listed as Vulnerable under the NSW TSC ActThe marine life comprise both subtropical and temperate species due to its location and influence of the southerly flowing East Australian Current (EAC). As a consequence, the waters surrounding Lord Howe Island show rich and unique biodiversity. An extensive barrier coral reef protects a broad sheltered lagoon and sandy beach on the western side of the island, while fringing reef occurs immediately offshore of the beaches on the eastern side. The Lord Howe Island Group supports a diverse inshore fish fauna with greater than 400 species recorded. 10% of the marine inshore fish species are known to be endemic, meaning they are only found at Lord Howe Island, while 8% of the 110 species of echinoderms are also endemic. A wide variety of seabirds roost and nest on the island but feed on schools of fish and squid. This diversity reflects the mixing of tropical species with temperate species and the range of marine environments present.  Human impacts, environmental issues and threats  It is becoming widely known that the world's marine biodiversity is under threat due to overexploitation and degrading human activities, such as pollution rapidly changing species habitat and leading to species loss. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and four invertebrate species have become locally extinct. Isolated islands are under a disproportionate level of threat due to their small range and high level of endemic taxa. Even small human-induced disturbances can lead to species extinction. Key threatening processes relevant to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park include anthropogenic climate change, and entanglement in or ingestion of anthropogenic debris in marine environments. Anthropogenic climate change is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation (TSC) Act 1995 while loss of climatic habitat caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases is listed under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. Climate change is likely to alter sea surface temperatures which can have severe consequences for seabird breeding. There has been significant growth in people pressure over time. Visitor numbers have increased significantly as has the amount of available accommodation options. From 1988 to 2000 the Lord Howe Island population grew by 13%, the number of dwellings increased by 55% and the number of visitors increased by nearly 100%. = The marine littoral zone = Lord Howe Island has 37 km of shoreline or littoral zone, with only eight kilometres readily accessible. This eight kilometres has been most heavily impacted as most of the forest has been cleared to the edge of the beach, removing the buffer to strong prevalent winds, impacting the forest behind. = The lagoon = View of the lagoon from Mount Eliza. The lagoon forms the majority of the Lord Howe Island Marine ParkThe lagoon is six kilometres long and 1.5 km wide and contains the largest of Lord Howe Island's coral reef system, assessed as having World Heritage values. The main identified threats to the marine environment are the impact of water quality welling up in the lagoon from groundwater, the potential changes of turbidity affecting the clarity of water in the lagoon, the impact from anchor damage (outside as well as inside the lagoon), overfishing particularly of the slower growing fish species which inhabit the drop-off, and dramatic water temperature changes causing coral bleaching and death of other marine species.  Results of management  To abate human influence on marine biodiversity worldwide, marine parks are becoming widely advocated as a tool for conserving biodiversity and managing overfishing. Elsewhere, protected areas such as marine reserves have been attributed to increased species densities, biodiversity, species growth, biomass, and reproductive output. It is a similar case for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park Species habitat is typically used as the major component of designing marine parks: if a number of habitat classes are protected, so are the species within them, hence effectively protecting and hopefully in turn increasing marine biodiversity. This is the goal of the marine park at Lord Howe Island. A study conducted in 2010, six years after the implementation of zoning showed the mean number of fish species, density and biomass of fishes is typically higher in sanctuary zones than in habitat protection zones where fishing is allowed. The mean cover of hard corals was also higher in sanctuary zones. Sanctuary zones have been found successful in protecting key species and biomass, though longer term datasets and further research into increasing subtidal macro algal communities in sanctuary zones is required. A review of other research following the implementation of the Marine Park has outlined a number of successes and negative outcomes. This research found the Galapagos shark, Carcharhinus galapagensis increased in number in sanctuary zones, while there was an increase in abundance of the endemic double header wrasse, Coris bulbifrons, bluefish, Girella cyanea and the spotted sawtail, Prionurus maculates, in sanctuary zones. Negative outcomes have shown populations of the habitat modifying urchin, Centrostaphanus rodgersii, increased threefold between 2006-2010 and densities of the second most abundant urchin, Heliocidaris tuberculata, has doubled. If sea urchins become overpopulated, they can have major impacts on reef systems through overgrazing of important algae. Other negatives include a large and significant decline in population of bluefish within habitat protection zones. While there will continue to be both success and failures following the implementation of the marine park, the successes will continue to outweigh the failures until such time that equilibrium within the marine ecosystem is reached, this can take up to 20 years from the date of implementation.

The tale is included in the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification system as type 156. The story reappeared in the Middle Ages as \\"The Shepherd and the Lion\\" and was then ascribed to Aesop's Fables. It is numbered 563 in the Perry Index and can be compared to Aesop's The Lion and the Mouse in both its general trend and in its moral of the reciprocal nature of mercy.  Classical tale  The earliest surviving account of the episode is found in Aulus Gellius's 2nd century Attic Nights.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, Book V. xiv The author relates there a story told by Apion in his lost work Aegyptiacorum (Wonders of Egypt), the events of which Apion claimed to have personally witnessed in Rome. In this version, Androclus (going by the Latin variation of the name) is a runaway slave of a former Roman consul administering a part of Africa. He takes shelter in a cave, which turns out to be the den of a wounded lion, from whose paw he removes a large thorn. In gratitude, the lion becomes tame towards him and henceforward shares his catch with the slave. After three years, Androclus craves a return to civilization but is soon imprisoned as a fugitive slave and sent to Rome. There he is condemned to be devoured by wild animals in the Circus Maximus in the presence of an emperor who is named in the account as Gaius Caesar, presumably Caligula.Based on the dates of Apion's tenure in Rome, see The most imposing of the beasts turns out to be the same lion, which again displays its affection toward Androclus. After questioning him, the emperor pardons the slave in recognition of this testimony to the power of friendship, and he is left in possession of the lion. Apion, who claimed to have been a spectator on this occasion, is then quoted as relating: > Afterwards we used to see Androclus with the lion attached to a slender > leash, making the rounds of the tabernae throughout the city; Androclus was > given money, the lion was sprinkled with flowers, and everyone who met them > anywhere exclaimed, \\"This is the lion, a man's friend; this is the man, a > lion's doctor\\".The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius, p. 258 The story was repeated a century later by Claudius Aelianus in his work On the Nature of Animals.Claudius Aelianus, Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œñ·ø¥œâŒΩ ·º∏Œ¥ŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, Book VII.xlviii Later use Later versions of the story, sometimes attributed to Aesop, began to appear from the mid-sixth century under the title \\"The Shepherd and the Lion\\". In Chr√©tien de Troyes' 12th-century romance, \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", the knightly main character helps a lion that is attacked by a serpent. The lion then becomes his companion and helps him during his adventures. A century later, the story of taking a thorn from a lion's paw was related as an act of Saint Jerome in the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine ().The story is included in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of this translation Afterwards the lion joins him in the monastery and a different set of stories follows. The later retelling, \\"Of the Remembrance of Benefits\\", in the Gesta Romanorum (Deeds of the Romans) of about 1330 in England, has a mediaeval setting and again makes the protagonist a knight. In the earliest English printed collection of Aesop's Fables by William Caxton, the tale appears as The lyon & the pastour or herdman and reverts to the story of a shepherd who cares for the wounded lion. He is later convicted of a crime and taken to Rome to be thrown to the wild beasts, only to be recognised and defended from the other animals by the one that he tended. A Latin poem by Vincent Bourne dating from 1716‚Äì17 is based on the account of Aulus Gellius.Estelle Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne, American Philosophical Society 2007, pp.52‚Äì4 Titled Mutua Benevolentia primaria lex naturae est, it was translated by William Cowper as ‚ÄúReciprocal kindness: the primary law of nature‚Äù.The poetical works, Latin and English, of Vincent Bourne, London 1838, pp.128‚Äì31 George Bernard Shaw's play Androcles and the Lion (1912) makes Androcles a tailor; he is also given Christian beliefs for the purposes of the play, which on the whole takes a skeptical view of religion. The first film adaptation of the story in the US was also made in 1912. Afterwards there were several others for both cinema and TV.IMDb.com Rob Englehart's The Lion, the Slave and the Rodent (2010) was a much later American approach to the fable. A one-act chamber opera for five voices, it combined the story of Androcles with the fable of ‚ÄúThe Lion and the Mouse‚Äù.Lake Superior Theater Artistic depictions =Prints and paintings= Renaissance prints of the story are based on the Classical accounts. Agostino Veneziano depicts the slave Androcles being freed by the emperor in a work from 1516‚Äì17 now in the LACMA collection.LACMA site There is also an early pen and wash drawing by Baldassare Peruzzi dating from the 1530s in the Hermitage Museum. Dependent on the account by Aulus Gellius, it depicts Androcles walking through a doorway with the lion on a lead at his heel.Gallery site Other artists have preferred the scene of Androcles pulling the thorn from the lion's paw, as in Bernhard Rode's print of 1784.Mentioned in Michel Huber, Catalogue raisonn√© du cabinet d'estampes par feu m.

That by Charles Meynier, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1795, is now lost. However, a study for the painting has recently been discovered and shows Androcles as a nearly naked warrior brandishing his sword in the stadium while the lion lies on the ground and is ‚Äì following the account of Aulus Gellius ‚Äì \\"gently licking his feet\\".Bonhams Auction site There are also studies for an unachieved painting by American artist Henry Ossawa Tanner dating from his student years in 1885-6.Anna O.

There a young man in Arab dress looks towards the viewer as he walks across a desert landscape with his hand in the lion‚Äôs mane.The Saleroom In the 20th century, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me depicted Androcles in a painting tentatively dated 1902 and now in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires).Maria Isabel Baldasare, Sobre los inicios del coleccionismo y los museos de arte en la Argentina, Anais do Museu Paulista: Hist√≥ria e Cultura Material, S√£o Paulo, vol.14.1, 2006, p.305 There Androcles is sitting cross-legged on the floor of the cave as he draws the thorn from the lion's paw while it roars in agony.Wikimedia Briton Riviere's 1908 painting of him standing to perform the same task is in the Auckland Art Gallery.Gallery site Another approach was to show the earlier incident of Androcles surprised in the cave by the lion's entrance. This was the subject chosen by Vassily Rotschev (d.1803) soon after returning to Russia from training in Rome.‚ÄúBiographical notes of Russian artists‚Äù, The monthly magazine and British register, Volume 21 (1806) p.399 It was also the choice of the Chinese painter Xu Beihong. His \\"Slave and Lion\\" dates from a stay in Berlin during the early 1920s and shows the lion entering the mouth of a cave while Androcles cowers against the wall.Christies site =Sculptures= Androcles also became a sculptural subject. Jan Pieter van Baurscheit the Elder's sandstone statue, executed between 1700 and 1725, is now at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and shows a triumphant figure bestriding a very small lion that rears up to look at him.Rijksmuseum Its frisky behaviour brings to mind Aulus Gellius‚Äô description of the lion ‚Äúwagging his tail in a mild and caressing way, after the manner and fashion of fawning dogs‚Äù.The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius, p.256 In 1751 the English monumental sculptor Henry Cheere created two white marble chimneypieces showing the slave bending over the lion's paw to draw out the thorn. One is in the Saloon at West Wycombe Park, and the other is now in the Lady Lever Art Gallery. A continental example by Jean- Baptiste Stouf was sculpted in 1789 and is now only known through the modern bronze reproduction at the Ashmolean Museum.Cultural Property Advice: Ashmolean Formerly it was in the Louvre and showed Androcles tending the lion's paw.Charles Othon Fr√©d√©ric Jean Baptiste de Clarac, Description du Mus√©e Royal des Antiques du Louvre, Paris 1830, p.249 In the 19th century Androcles became a subject for French table ornaments.

Titled Le Mendiant (the beggar), it is made of bronze gilt and shows the former slave standing with one hand on the lion's mane and a begging bowl at his feet. On its stand is the inscription Date obolum Androcli (spare a penny for Androclus).Wikimedia In the 20th century the American sculptor Frederick Charles Shrady incorporated the theme of removing the thorn from the paw into a modernistic design.Shrady site =Medals= Gioacchino Francesco Travani's medal in honour of Pope Alexander VII The legend has figured on medals for various reasons over the course of four centuries. One attributed to Gioacchino Francesco Travani, using a design by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, was struck in 1659. It depicts on one side a relief bust of Pope Alexander VII surrounded by an acanthus leaf border. On the reverse a lion prostrates itself at the feet of an armed Androcles. The complimentary Latin inscription reads 'Domenico Jacobacci to the generous prince: Even a wild animal remembers a favor'. Jacobacci was the donor of the medal, which commemorates a pope who had been generous in rebuilding parts of Rome. The lion represents the grateful city paying homage at the feet of the 'warrior' on its behalf.Maarten Delbeke, The Art of Religion, Farnham 2012, Google Books The image of the grateful beast was a natural choice for the medals awarded in yearly recognition of prize-winners at the Royal Dick Veterinary College in Edinburgh. Struck in copper and silver during the 1890s, they picture Androcles kneeling to relieve the suffering lion. In the background are a cliff on the left and palm trees on the right; Androcles is depicted with African features.British school medals, Neocollect A more schematic representation now forms the logo of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Utrecht University. In the 20th century, the Dutch Medal of Recognition 1940‚Äì1945 also pictured the scene of relieving the lion and was awarded to those who aided the Dutch during the period of World War II, or afterwards helped those who had suffered from the German occupation. The subject was chosen because a lion was the national symbol. The theme of gratitude is reinforced by the inscription about the edge: Sibi benefacit qui benefacit amico (He benefits himself who benefits a friend).

World Heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey dominated the sport through much of the decade. He won the title in 1919, keeping it until 1926. He lost the title to Gene Tunney in 1926, but many of his fights were historic, such as his defenses against Georges Carpentier, Luis Firpo and Tom Gibbons, a fight which almost bankrupted the town of Shelby, Montana. His 1927 rematch against Tunney became known in boxing history as The Long Count Fight. Dempsey became a household name, and he dated and married Hollywood actresses. He was, along with Babe Ruth, Red Grange, Bill Tilden and Bobby Jones, one of the so-called Big Five of sports. Other important boxers included Benny Lynch (from West Scotland). Panama Al Brown was the first Hispanic to become a world champion. Because airlines lacked the structured schedules of the modern days, many boxers had to make their way to important fights by train. In 1921, the National Boxing Association was formed. It was the predecessor of what is known now as the WBA. Tex Rickard was the leading promoter of the day, and he has been compared to P.T.

S/MIME is on an IETF standards track and defined in a number of documents, most importantly . It was originally developed by RSA Data Security and the original specification used the IETF MIME specificationRFC 2045: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). Part One was published in November 1996. with the de facto industry standard PKCS#7 secure message format. Change control to S/MIME has since been vested in the IETF and the specification is now layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), an IETF specification that is identical in most respects with PKCS #7. S/MIME functionality is built into the majority of modern email software and interoperates between them. Since it is built on CMS, MIME can also hold an advanced electronic signature.  Function  S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications: * Authentication * Message integrity * Non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures) * Privacy * Data security (using encryption) S/MIME specifies the MIME type \`application/pkcs7-mime\` (smime-type \\"enveloped-data\\") for data enveloping (encrypting) where the whole (prepared) MIME entity to be enveloped is encrypted and packed into an object which subsequently is inserted into an application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.  S/MIME certificates  Before S/MIME can be used in any of the above applications, one must obtain and install an individual key/certificate either from one's in-house certificate authority (CA) or from a public CA. The accepted best practice is to use separate private keys (and associated certificates) for signature and for encryption, as this permits escrow of the encryption key without compromise to the non- repudiation property of the signature key. Encryption requires having the destination party's certificate on store (which is typically automatic upon receiving a message from the party with a valid signing certificate). While it is technically possible to send a message encrypted (using the destination party certificate) without having one's own certificate to digitally sign, in practice, the S/MIME clients will require the user to install their own certificate before they allow encrypting to others. This is necessary so the message can be encrypted for both, recipient and sender, and a copy of the message can be kept (in the sent folder) and be readable for the sender. A typical basic (\\"class 1\\") personal certificate verifies the owner's \\"identity\\" only insofar as it declares that the sender is the owner of the \\"From:\\" email address in the sense that the sender can receive email sent to that address, and so merely proves that an email received really did come from the \\"From:\\" address given. It does not verify the person's name or business name. If a sender wishes to enable email recipients to verify the sender's identity in the sense that a received certificate name carries the sender's name or an organization's name, the sender needs to obtain a certificate (\\"class 2\\") from a CA who carries out a more in-depth identity verification process, and this involves making inquiries about the would-be certificate holder. For more detail on authentication, see digital signature. Depending on the policy of the CA, the certificate and all its contents may be posted publicly for reference and verification. This makes the name and email address available for all to see and possibly search for. Other CAs only post serial numbers and revocation status, which does not include any of the personal information. The latter, at a minimum, is mandatory to uphold the integrity of the public key infrastructure.  Obstacles to deploying S/MIME in practice  * S/MIME is sometimes considered not properly suited for use via webmail clients. Though support can be hacked into a browser, some security practices require the private key to be kept accessible to the user but inaccessible from the webmail server, complicating the key advantage of webmail: providing ubiquitous accessibility. This issue is not fully specific to S/MIME: other secure methods of signing webmail may also require a browser to execute code to produce the signature; exceptions are PGP Desktop and versions of GnuPG, which will grab the data out of the webmail, sign it by means of a clipboard, and put the signed data back into the webmail page. Seen from the view of security this is a more secure solution. * S/MIME is tailored for end-to-end security. Logically it is not possible to have a third party inspecting email for malware and also have secure end-to-end communications. Encryption will not only encrypt the messages, but also the malware. Thus if mail is not scanned for malware anywhere but at the end points, such as a company's gateway, encryption will defeat the detector and successfully deliver the malware. The only solution to this is to perform malware scanning on end user stations after decryption. Other solutions do not provide end-to-end trust as they require keys to be shared by a third party for the purpose of detecting malware. Examples of this type of compromise are: ** Solutions which store private keys on the gateway server so decryption can occur prior to the gateway malware scan. These unencrypted messages are then delivered to end users. ** Solutions which store private keys on malware scanners so that it can inspect messages content, the encrypted message is then relayed to its destination. * Due to the requirement of a certificate for implementation, not all users can take advantage of S/MIME, as some may wish to encrypt a message, with a public/private key pair for example, without the involvement or administrative overhead of certificates. Any message that an S/MIME email client stores encrypted cannot be decrypted if the applicable key pair's private key is unavailable or otherwise unusable (e.g., the certificate has been deleted or lost or the private key's password has been forgotten). However, an expired, revoked, or untrusted certificate will remain usable for cryptographic purposes. Indexing of encrypted messages' clear text may not be possible with all email clients. Neither of these potential dilemmas is specific to S/MIME but rather cipher text in general and do not apply to S/MIME messages that are only signed and not encrypted. S/MIME signatures are usually \\"detached signatures\\": the signature information is separate from the text being signed. The MIME type for this is \`multipart/signed\` with the second part having a MIME subtype of \`application/(x-)pkcs7-signature\`. Mailing list software is notorious for changing the textual part of a message and thereby invalidating the signature; however, this problem is not specific to S/MIME, and a digital signature only reveals that the signed content has been changed.  Security issues  On May 13, 2018, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) announced critical vulnerabilities in S/MIME, together with an obsolete form of PGP that is still used, in many email clients. Dubbed EFAIL, this is a particularly critical hit to S/MIME that will require significant coordinated effort by many email client vendors to fix.

About NetLogo was designed by Uri Wilensky, in the spirit of the programming language Logo, to be \\"low threshold and no ceiling\\". It teaches programming concepts using agents in the form of turtles, patches, links and the observer. NetLogo was designed for multiple audiences in mind, in particular: teaching children in the education community, and for domain experts without a programming background to model related phenomena. Many scientific articles have been published using NetLogo. The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains, such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, system dynamics. NetLogo allows exploration by modifying switches, sliders, choosers, inputs, and other interface elements. Beyond exploring, NetLogo allows authoring new models and modifying extant models. NetLogo is open source and freely available from the NetLogo website. It is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school. Many teachers make use of NetLogo in their curricula. NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky, director of Northwestern University's Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL).  Other features  In addition to agent-based modeling, NetLogo also includes basic support for dynamic system modeling.  Books  Several books have been published about NetLogo. Books available in print include:  * Books available online include: * Online courses , several massive open online courses are being offered that use NetLogo for assignments and/or demonstrations:  Technical foundation NetLogo is free and open-source software, released under a GNU General Public License (GPL). Commercial licenses are also available. It is written in Scala and Java and runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM). At its core is a hybrid interpreter/compiler that partially compiles user code to JVM bytecode. NetLogo Web is a version that runs on JavaScript, instead of the JVM, so models may be run in a web browser. However, it does not have all features of the desktop version, and the official website advises that the \\"desktop version of NetLogo is recommended for most uses\\". Examples A simple multiagent model in NetLogo is the Wolf-Sheep Predation model, which is shown in the screenshot above. It models the population growth of a predator/prey system over time. It has the following characteristics: * There are two breed of turtles, called sheep and wolves. * Sheep and wolves move randomly and have limited energy. * Wolves and sheep lose energy by moving. If a wolf or sheep has zero energy, it dies. * Sheep gain energy by eating grass. * Wolves gain energy by eating sheep. * Both wolves and sheep can reproduce, sharing energy with their offspring. HubNet HubNet is a technology that uses NetLogo to run participatory simulations in the classroom. In a participatory simulation, a whole group of users takes part in enacting the behavior of a system. Using an individual device, such as a networked computer or Texas Instruments graphing calculator, each user acts as a separate, independent agent.

Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats can match any color they see with a mixture of no more than two pure spectral lights. By comparison, trichromats can perceive colors made of up to three pure spectral lights, and tetrachromats can perceive colors made of four. Dichromacy in humans is a color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and sex-linked, predominantly affecting males.Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. Dictionary of Eye Terminology. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990. Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.\\"Guidelines: Colour Blindness.\\" Tiresias.org. Retrieved 29 September 2006. The term is from di meaning \\"two\\" and chroma meaning \\"color\\". Classification There are various kinds of color blindness: * Protanopia is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which there is impairment in perception of very long wavelengths, such as reds. To these individuals, reds are perceived as beige or grey and greens tend to look beige or grey like reds. It is also the most common type of dichromacy today. This problem occurs because patients do not have the red cone cells in the retina. Protanomaly is a less severe version. * Deuteranopia consists of an impairment in perceiving medium wavelengths, such as greens. Deuteranomaly is a less severe form of deuteranopia. Those with deuteranomaly cannot see reds and greens like those without this condition; however, they can still distinguish them in most cases. It is very similar to protanopia. In this form, patients do not have green cone cells in the retina, which makes it hard to see the green color. * A rarer form of color blindness is tritanopia, where there exists an inability to perceive short wavelengths, such as blues. Sufferers have trouble distinguishing between yellow and blue. They tend to confuse greens and blues, and yellow can appear pink. This is the rarest of all dichromacy, and occurs in around 1 in 100,000 people. Patients do not have the blue cone cells in the retina. Diagnosis The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane. The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provide enough information to identify the fundamental colour space, the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour. The cones excited to a corresponding colour in the colour space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colours. Color detecting abilities of dichromats According to colour vision researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (including Jay Neitz), each of the three standard colour-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats ‚Äì blue, green and red ‚Äì can pick up about 100 different gradations of colour. If each detector is independent of the others, simple exponentiation gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million; nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million. Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green color blindness) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours,\\"Color Vision:Almost Reason for Having Eyes\\" by Jay Neitz, Joseph Carroll, and Maureen Neitz Optics & Photonics News January 2001 1047-6938/01/01/0026/8- Optical Society of America but no such calculation has been verified by psychophysical testing. Furthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for coloured stimuli flickering at low (1 Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16 Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats. This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual percept as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough frame rate. Other animals It is more informative to use situations where less than the total visual system is operating when studying about vision. For example, a system by which cones are the sole visual receptors could be used. This is rare in humans but certain animals possess this trait and this proves useful in understanding the concept of dichromacy. While their Triassic ancestors were trichromatic, placental mammals are as a rule dichromatic; the ability to see long wavelengths (and thus separate green and red) was lost in the ancestor of placental mammals, though it is believed to have been retained in marsupials, where trichromatic vision is widespread. Recent genetic and behavioral evidence suggests the South American marsupial Didelphis albiventris is dichromatic, with only two classes of cone opsins having been found within the genus Didelphis. Dichromatic vision may improve an animal's ability to distinguish colours in dim light; the typically nocturnal nature of mammals, therefore, may have led to the evolution of dichromacy as the basal mode of vision in placental animals. The exceptions to dichromatic vision in placental mammals are primates closely related to humans, which are usually trichromats, and sea mammals (both pinnipeds and cetaceans) which are cone monochromats. New World Monkeys are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats.Sternberg, Robert J.

Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language code was written by Charles Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s. History Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison were introduced to Atari's arcade game Touch Me at the Music Operators of America (MOA) trade show in 1976. Baer said of the product, \\"Nice gameplay. Terrible execution. Visually boring. Miserable, rasping sounds.\\" The prototype built by Baer used the low cost Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcontroller chip, which was in many games of the 1970s. Lenny Cope, who was one of Ralph H. Baer's partners, programmed the core of the game, titled Follow Me at the time. Baer developed the tones of the game, inspired by the notes of a bugle. When they pitched the demo, an 8-by-8-inch console, to the Milton Bradley Company the name of the game was changed to Simon. Simon debuted in 1978 at a retail price of $24.95 () and became one of the top-selling toys that Christmas. : \\"Microcomputer controlled game\\", was granted in 1980. Milton Bradley soon capitalized on the original with both the smaller-sized Pocket Simon and the expanded, eight-button Super Simon. Many variants of Simon have been made since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s, building on the possibilities offered by advances in technology. The original Super Simon was reinvented in the late 1990s as a hexagonal unit with six buttons. 2000 saw Simon Squared (or Simon2), a unit with the four traditional buttons on one side, and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other. In 2004, Hasbro released the Simon Stix. The game features two electronic sticks (modeled after drumsticks), an emphasis on the musical part of the game, and features four levels of play. In 2005, Hasbro released Simon Trickster (also known as Simon Tricks in Europe and in the UK, and as Simon Genius in Brazil), which features four game modes, in a similar fashion to another Hasbro game, Bop It, and colored lenses instead of buttons. \\"Simon Classic\\" mode plays up to 35 tones(notes). \\"Simon Bounce\\" is similar to \\"Simon Classic\\", but instead the colors of the lenses change. \\"Simon Surprise\\" is one of the most difficult games in the unit. Every lens becomes the same color and the player has to memorize the location. \\"Simon Rewind\\" requires the player to memorize the sequence backwards. During each game, the player is paid a compliment after a certain number of tones completed. On reaching five and eleven tones, the computer will randomly choose \\"Awesome!\\", \\"Nice!\\", \\"Sweet!\\" or \\"Respect!\\". On reaching 18 tones, the game will play a victory melody three times. On reaching the ultimate 35 tones, the game will play the victory melody again and will say \\"Respect!\\". If the player fails to memorize the pattern or fails to press the right color within the time limit, the game will play a crashing sound and the game will say \\"Later!\\". In 2011, Hasbro introduced Simon Flash. In this version, the game is played with four cube- shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending on the game mode. In 2013, Hasbro reinvented Simon once again with Simon Swipe. The game was demonstrated at the New York Toy Fair 2014 and released that summer. The game is a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel. It has been extended from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are flattened out on the unit. The game features four game modes, called \\"Levels\\" (the main game), \\"Classic\\", \\"Party\\" and \\"Extreme\\". The player has to go through all sixteen levels to beat the game. \\"Classic\\", \\"Party\\" and \\"Extreme\\" levels focus on one pattern getting longer and longer until the player is out. A smaller version of the game, called Simon Micro Series, was introduced in the fall of 2014. This version has only two game modes called \\"Solo\\" and \\"Pass It\\" and features 14 levels and four buttons. There is also a version of Simon created by Basic Fun known as the Touch Simon. This version has an LCD screen and plays melodies at specific parts of the game. In 2016, Hasbro launched the followup to Simon Swipe with Simon Air. The game was announced at a Hasbro press conference before the 2016 New York Toy Fair. This version of Simon uses motion sensors, similar to those in Mattel's Loopz line of games. The game has three game modes, \\"Solo\\", \\"Classic\\" and \\"Multiplayer\\". A button-pressing version of Simon was also released in the US, with an aesthetic recalling that of the 1970s and 1980s models. Recently, Hasbro has released Simon Optix, a headset game with a motion sensor technology similar to Simon Air. Gameplay The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.) Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says, but the gameplay is based on Atari's unpopular Touch Me arcade game from 1974. Simon differs from Touch Me in that the Touch Me buttons were all of the same color (black) and the sounds it produced were harsh and grating. Simon's tones, on the other hand, were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence, and consisted of an A major triad in second inversion, resembling a trumpet fanfare: * E-note (blue, lower right); * C‚ôØ-note (yellow, lower left); * A-note (red, upper right). * E-note (green, upper left, an octave lower than blue); The re-released version of Simon Simon was later re-released by Milton Bradley - now owned by Hasbro - in its original circular form, though with a translucent case rather than plain black. It was also sold as a two-sided Simon Squared version, with the reverse side having eight buttons for head-to- head play, and as a keychain (officially licensed by Fun4All) with simplified gameplay (only having Game 1, Difficulty 4 available). Other variations of the original game, no longer produced, include Pocket Simon and the eight-button Super Simon, both from 1980. Nelsonic released an official wristwatch version of Simon. Later versions of the game included a pocket version of the original game in a smaller, yellow, oval-shaped case. Another iteration, Simon Trickster, plays the original game as well as variations in which the colors shift around from button to button (Simon Bounce), the buttons have no colors at all (Simon Surprise) and the player must repeat the sequence backwards (Simon Rewind). A pocket version of Simon Trickster was also produced. In the 2014 version of Simon called Simon Swipe, the notes are as follows: * G-note (blue, lower right); * C-note (yellow, lower left); * E-note (red, upper right). * G-note (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue) The swiping sounds are presented with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, the bigger the swipe will be. The exact notes and sound effects were also used for a smaller version called Simon Micro Series. The sounds were then recreated for Simon Air and Simon Optix. Clones As a popular game, Simon inspired many imitators and knockoffs. Atari released a handheld version of Touch Me in 1978, with multicolored buttons and pleasant musical tones. Though named for the older arcade game, the handheld Touch Me contained Simon's three game variations and four difficulty levels, albeit with limits of 8, 16, 32 and 99 instead of 8, 14, 20 and 31. Even its button layout mirrored that of Simon (though upside-down), with blue in the upper left, yellow in the upper right, red in the lower left and green in the lower right. Its only unique features were an LED score display, similar to that of its arcade counterpart, and its small size, similar to that of a pocket calculator. Other clones include: * Monkey See, Monkey Do, which featured a similar casing as that of Simon, except that the buttons were oval-shaped. * Tiger Electronics' Copy Cat in 1979, re-released with a transparent case in 1988 and using buzzers. ** Repackaged and released by Sears as Follow Me. ** Released as Copy Cat Jr. in 1981, and as Pocket Repeat by Tandy Computers and Radio Shack. * Castle Toy's Einstein in 1979. * Genius, launched in the 80s in Brazil, by Brinquedos Estrela. * Space Echo by an unknown company. * Makezine has a DIY version that requires soldering. * Another DIY version called Electronic Memory Game based on ARM Cortex microcontrollers * The \\"Game A\\" mode of the second game in the Game & Watch handheld series Flagman (Silver, 5th Jun 1980). \\"Game B\\" is the same, but doesn't play in a sequence, while the player has a limited time to press the corresponding number lit up. * R2-D2 Ditto Droid, a Star Wars version featuring R2-D2 sounds and Star Wars-themed graphics by Tiger Electronics, 1997. * Vtech's Wizard. * A side quest in both the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! that involves freeing creatures called \\"Banana Birds\\" using buttons on each system's controller. * Soviet Elektronika IE-01 Ivolga, nearly an exact visual replica of Simon. *Oddworld games, in which the playable character must progress by completing certain puzzles with a sequence of sounds. The same gameplay also appears on multi-game handhelds such as: *Tiger Electronics' Brain Warp and Brain Shift games: instead of tones, the game unit issues a recorded voice that calls out colors and numbers in Game 4 - Memory Match. Brain Shift has two memory games, Game 2 (Memory Shift) and Game 3 (Who Shift's It?), that call out colors. * Mego Corporation's Fabulous Fred (Game 3, The Memory Game). * Parker Brothers' Merlin (Game 3, Echo). * Atari also included a nine-button version of Touch Me as game variations 1-4 (out of 19) on the 1978 Brain Games cartridge for the Atari 2600. * A fan-made homebrew video game version of Simon was unofficially made available for modded Wiis in 2008. * A Harry Potter wand released in 2001 called Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge had Simon gameplay and voice commands: \\"Wingardium\\" (to tilt the wand down) and \\"Leviosa\\" (to tilt the wand up.). Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge Instruction Audio Some versions of the game have tones that play as long as the button is depressed, but others have a constant sound duration. Some versions feature audio themes, such as animals (cat/dog/pig/cow), xylophone, football and space sounds, some of which make the game easier to play. Some versions also have a sound on/off setting, which can make the game harder with only visual cues. In popular culture * In the 1987 Stephen King's novel The Tommyknockers, a forgotten Simon game left in the back seat of a reporter's car activates itself and, in an accelerated color-switching frenzy, overheats and melts its casing, scorching the seat beneath. The surprised driver then knocks it to the floor before it goes up in flames. * In the It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia episode \\"A Very Sunny Christmas\\", Mac finds the game in his closet and Charlie finds it extremely difficult. * In an episode of Little Miss Gamer, Simon causes the title character to meet Tom Green and Blackwolf the Dragon Master. * In the Family Guy episode \\"Perfect Castaway\\", Stewie plays with Simon and makes up his own song lyrics to the random key sequences. * In the American Dad! episode \\"The One That Got Away\\", the family becomes addicted to the game, playing it for days without moving. * In the film 2009 Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Flint, the main character, has to click the correct sequence on a Simon to get into his lab. * In the 2012 Cougar Town episode \\"You Can Still Change Your Mind\\", Ellie uses the game to taunt \\"Jelly Bean\\" (Laurie) about her intellectual shortcomings. * In the 2014 film Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, a Simon game is possessed by a demon and works as a mock ouija board. * In a Robot Chicken sketch, Dick Cheney's heart is replaced with a Simon, in a parody of Iron Man. * The concept was used as the bonus round in the British game show Ant & Dec's Push the Button. * A minigame resembling Simon appeared in the 2002 video game Sabrina the Teenage Witch: Potion Commotion for the Game Boy Advance. * A Simon game signed by Baer is on permanent display at the American Computer & Robotics Museum in Bozeman, Montana. * In the 2014 video game South Park: The Stick of Truth, the player plays Simon in order to rescue Randy Marsh from an alien probe. * The quick time event mechanic in the 2005 video game Indigo Prophecy was modeled after the toy. * Simon was among the bounty stolen by the 18th century pirates from the sailboat in the 1980 film (and Peter Benchley screenplay) The Island, with the pirates becoming frustrated by not being able to figure out how it worked. * Simon was used in the 2017 film Monster Trucks to demonstrate training the sea creatures captured by Terravex energy. * In Despicable Me 3, villain Balthazar Bratt, who has an arsenal of 1980s-themed gadgets, uses Simon as his alarm system. * In Season 6 of Silicon Valley, Nelson \\"Big Head\\" Bighetti spends days playing Simon during working hours at the Business Incubator, and unwittingly internalizes Jian-Yang's SSH key by singing the key's characters along with the lit colors in the game. * In late 2020, the popular game Among Us featured a mini-game loosely based on the design of Simon.

Most have three wheels and do not tilt. They are known by many terms in various countries including auto, auto/auto rickshaw taxi, baby taxi, pigeon, bajaj, chand gari, lapa, tuk-tuk, 3wheel or tukxi. The auto rickshaw is a common form of urban transport, both as a vehicle for hire and for private use, in many countries around the world. They are especially common in countries with tropical or subtropical climates, since they usually are not fully enclosed, and in many developing countries because they are relatively inexpensive to own and operate. As of 2019, Bajaj Auto of Pune, India is the world's largest auto rickshaw manufacturer, selling 780,000 during the fiscal year. There are many different auto rickshaw types, designs, and variations. The most common type is characterized by a sheet- metal body or open frame resting on three wheels; a canvas roof with drop-down side curtains; a small cabin at the front for the driver (in India, the auto- wallah or tuktuK-wallah), with handlebar controls; and a cargo, passenger, or dual purpose space at the rear. Another common type is a motorcycle that has an expanded sidecar or, less often, is pushing or pulling a passenger compartment. Origin Daihatsu Midget Model DKA In the 1930s Japan, which was the most industrialized country in east Asia at the time, encouraged the development of motorized vehicles including less expensive three-wheeled vehicles based on motorcycles. The Mazda-Go, a 3-wheel open \\"truck\\" released in 1931, is often considered the first of what became auto rickshaws. Later that decade the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of Japan distributed about 20,000 used three-wheelers to Southeast Asia as part of efforts to expand its influence in the region.„Éü„Çº„ÉÉ„ÉàÁâ©Ë™û Êú®Êùë‰ø°‰πã Ëëó È´òÂéüÊõ∏Â∫óÔºàNobuyuki Kimura \\"Story of Midget\\", Published on 10 November 1998ÔºâDaihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. public relations section/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=321:2009-11-30-05-34-59&catid;=54:2009-09-09-07-52-31&Itemid;=232 Royal Thai Embassy Tokyo, Japan Êó•Êú¨Áîü„Åæ„Çå„ÅÆ„Çø„Ç§„ÅÆ„Éà„Ç•„ÇØ„Éà„Ç•„ÇØ (Tuk-Tuk of Thailand was born in Japan.) They became popular in some areas, especially Thailand, which developed local manufacturing and design after three-wheelers went out of use in Japan when the Japanese Government abolished the three-wheeler license in 1965 . Production in Southeast Asia started from the knockdown production of the Daihatsu Midget, which was introduced in 1959. An exception is the indigenously-modified Philippine tricycle, which originates from the Rikuo Type 97 motorcycle with a sidecar, introduced to the islands in 1941 by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. In Europe, Corradino D'Ascanio, aircraft designer at Piaggio and inventor of the Vespa, came up with the idea of building a light three-wheeled commercial vehicle to power Italy's post-war economic reconstruction. The Piaggio Ape followed suit in 1947.  Regional variations   Africa and the Middle East  = Egypt = Locally named the \\"toktok,\\" the rickshaw is used to provide transportation in most parts of Egypt. = Gaza = Together with the recent boom of recreational facilities in Gaza for the local residents, donkey carts have all but been displaced by tuk-tuks in 2010. Due to the ban by Egypt and Israel on the import of most motorised vehicles, the tuk-tuks have had to be smuggled in parts through the tunnel network connecting Gaza with Egypt. = Madagascar = In Madagascar, man-powered rickshaws are a common form of transportation in a number of cities, especially Antsirabe. They are known as \\"posy\\" from pousse-pousse, meaning push-push. Cycle rickshaws took off since 2006 in a number of flat cities like Toamasina and replaced the major part of the posy, and are now threatened by the auto rickshaws, introduced in 2009. Provincial capitals like Toamasina, Mahajanga, Toliara, and Antsiranana are taking to them rapidly. They are known as \\"bajaji\\" in the north and \\"tuk-tuk\\" or \\"tik-tik\\" in the east, and are now licensed to operate as taxis. They are not yet allowed an operating licence in the congested, and more polluted national capital, Antananarivo. = Nigeria = Aerial view of autorickshaw congestion from a pedestrian bridge in Uyo, Southeast Nigeria The auto rickshaw is used to provide transportation in cities all over Nigeria. Popularity and use varies across the country however. In Lagos, for example, the \\"keke\\" (Yoruba for bicycle) is regulated and transportation around the state's highways is prohibited. = South Africa = Tuk-Tuk in Hermanus, South Africa (2014) Tuk- tuks, introduced in Durban in the late 1980s enjoyed growing popularity in recent years, particularly in Gauteng. In Cape Town they are used to deliver groceries and, more recently, transport tourists. Rickshaw in Omdurman (Sudan) = Sudan = Rickshaws, known as \\"Raksha\\" in Sudan, is the most common mean of transportation followed by the bus in the capital Khartoum. = Tanzania = Rickshaws are locally known as \\"bajaji\\" and are a common mode of transportation in Dar es Salaam. = Zimbabwe = Hende Moto electric 3 Wheeler Zimbabwe Hende Moto Taxi were first introduced in Zimbabwe as the first car manufactured by a Zimbabwean three wheeler manufacturing company Hende Moto Pvt Ltd, Hende Moto Engine in a Safari fiberglass body. The first Hende Moto Taxi was introduced in Kwekwe August 2019, Zimbabwe and thereafter, Victoria Falls City came second and lastly Harare 2019. Hende Moto is also the manufacturer of the first Zimbabwean made electric passenger three wheeled vehicle. It operates on a lithium ion battery that has a range of 70 miles on a 6-hour charge.  South Asia  =Afghanistan= A tuk-tuk in Herat Auto rickshaws are very common in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, where they are popularly decorated in art and colors. They are also popular in the northern city of Kunduz. = Bangladesh = \\"CNGs\\" in Dhaka Auto rickshaws (locally called \\"baby taxis\\" and more recently \\"CNGs\\" due to their fuel source, compressed natural gas) are one of the more popular modes of transport in Bangladesh mainly due to their size and speed. They are best suited to narrow, crowded streets, and are thus the principal means of covering longer distances within urban areas. Two-stroke engines had been identified as one of the leading sources of air pollution in Dhaka. Thus, since January 2003, traditional auto rickshaws were banned from the capital; only the new natural gas-powered models (CNG) were permitted to operate within the city limits. All CNGs are painted green to signify that the vehicles are eco-friendly and that each one has a meter built-in. =India = Most cities offer auto rickshaw service, although cycle rickshaws are also common and even hand-pulled rickshaws exist in certain areas such as Kolkata. Many state governments have launched an initiative of women friendly rickshaw service called the Pink Rickshaws . Auto rickshaws are used in cities and towns for short distances; they are less suited to long distances because they are slow and the carriages are open to air pollution. Auto rickshaws (often called \\"autos\\") provide cheap and efficient transportation. Modern auto rickshaws run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) due to government regulations and are environmentally friendly compared to full-sized cars. To augment speedy movement of traffic, auto rickshaws are not allowed in the southern part of Mumbai. India is the location of the annual Rickshaw Run. There are two types of auto rickshaws in India. In older versions the engines were below the driver's seat, while in newer versions engines are in the rear. They normally run on petrol, CNG, or diesel. The seating capacity of a normal rickshaw is four, including the driver's seat. Six-seater rickshaws exist in different parts of the country, but the model was officially banned in the city of Pune on 10 January 2003 by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA). CNG autos in many cities (e.g. Delhi, Agra) are distinguishable from the earlier petrol- powered autos by a green and yellow livery, as opposed to the earlier black and yellow appearance. In other cities (such as Mumbai) the only distinguishing feature is the 'CNG' print found on the back or side of the auto. Some local governments are considering four-stroke engines instead of two-stroke versions. Auto rickshaw manufacturers in India include Bajaj Auto, Atul Auto Limited, Kerala Automobiles Limited, Force Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Piaggio Ape, TVS Motors and Fleek Motors. Besides conventional autos, in Delhi there also used to be a variant powered by a Harley-Davidson engine called the phat-phati, because of the characteristic‚Äîand quite loud‚Äîsound it made. The story goes that shortly after Independence a stock of Harley-Davidson motorbikes were found that had been used by British troops during World War II and left behind in a military storage house in Delhi. Some enterprising drivers purchased these bikes, added on a gear box (probably from a Willys jeep), welded on a passenger compartment that was good for four to six passengers, and put the highly unusual and unconventional vehicles onto the roads. A 1998 ruling of the Supreme Court against the use of polluting vehicles finally signed the death warrant of Delhi's phat-phatis. India has about 1.5 million battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws on its roads. Some 11,000 new ones hit the streets each month, creating a US$1.5 billion market. Manufacturers include Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Kinetic Engineering. A hindrance to adoption to electric vehicles is the paucity of charging stations; India had only 425 at year-end 2017. By 2022 the number is projected to rise to 2,800.

They have also gone on strike multiple times in Delhi to protest against the government and High Court's 2012 order to install GPS systems, and even though GPS installation in public transport was made mandatory in 2015, as of 2017 compliance remains very low. = Nepal = Auto rickshaws were a popular mode of transport in Nepal during the 1980s and 1990s, until the government banned the movement of 600 such vehicles in the early 2000s. The earliest auto rickshaws running in Kathmandu were manufactured by Bajaj Auto. Nepal has been a popular destination for the Rickshaw Run. The 2009 Fall Run took place in Goa, India and ended in Pokhara, Nepal. = Pakistan = Auto rickshaws are a popular mode of transport in Pakistani towns and are mainly used for travelling short distances within cities. One of the major manufacturers of auto rickshaws is Piaggio. The government is taking measures to convert all gasoline powered auto rickshaws to cleaner CNG rickshaws by 2015 in all the major cities of Pakistan by issuing easy loans through commercial banks. Environment Canada is implementing pilot projects in Lahore, Karachi, and Quetta with engine technology developed in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada that uses CNG instead of gasoline in the two-stroke engines, in an effort to combat environmental pollution and noise levels. In many cities in Pakistan, there are also motorcycle rickshaws, usually called \\"chand gari\\" (moon car) or \\"chingchi\\", after the Chinese company Jinan Qingqi Motorcycle Co. Ltd who first introduced these to the market. There are many rickshaw manufacturers in Pakistan. Lahore is the hub of CNG auto rickshaw manufacturing. Manufacturers include: New Asia automobile Pvt, Ltd; AECO Export Company; STAHLCO Motors; Global Sources; Parhiyar Automobiles; Global Ledsys Technologies; Siwa Industries; Prime Punjab Automobiles; Murshid Farm Industries; Sazgar Automobiles; NTN Enterprises; and Imperial Engineering Company.

Sri Lankan three-wheelers are of the style of the light Phnom Penh-type. Most of the three-wheelers in Sri Lanka are a slightly modified Indian Bajaj model, imported from India though there are few manufactured locally and increasingly imports from other countries in the region and other brands of three-wheelers such as Piaggio Ape. a new gasoline powered tuk-tuk typically costs around , while a newly introduced Chinese electric model cost around . Since 2008, the Sri Lankan government has banned the import of all 2-stroke gasoline engines, due to environmental concerns. Ones imported to the island now are four-stroke engines. Most three-wheelers are available as hired vehicles, with few being used to haul goods or as private company or advertising vehicles. Bajaj enjoys a virtual monopoly in the island, with its agent being David Pieries Motor Co, Ltd. A few three- wheelers in Sri Lanka have distance meters. In the capital city it is becoming more and more common. The vast majority of fares are negotiated between the passenger and driver. There are 1.2 million trishaw's in Sri Lanka and most are on financial loans.

It is a widely used form of transportation in the capital of Phnom Penh and for visitors touring the Angkor temples in Siem Reap. Some have four wheels and is composed of a motorcycle (which leans) and trailer (which does not). Cambodian cities have a much lower volume of automobile traffic than Thai cities, and tuk-tuks are still the most common form of urban transport. There are more than 6,000 tuk-tuks in Phnom Penh, according to the Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association (IDEA), a union that represents tuk-tuk drivers among other members.

In Jakarta, the auto rickshaws are called Bajay or Bajaj and they are the same to as the ones in India but are colored blue (for the ones which use Compressed natural gas) and orange (for the ones which use normal gasoline fuel). The blue ones are imported from India with the brand of Bajaj and TVS and the orange ones are the old design from 1990 and are not powered by gas like the blue ones, yet the government is increasing units of the blue Bajays and is step by step decreasing the orange bajays. The Bajaj is one of the most popular modes of transportation in the city. Outside of Jakarta, the bentor- style auto rickshaw is ubiquitous, with the passenger cabin mounted as a sidecar (like in Medan) or in-front (like the ones in some parts of Sulawesi) to a motorcycle.

Unlike auto rickshaws, however, it has a motorcycle with a sidecar configuration and a different origin. The exact date of its appearance in the Philippines is unknown, but it started appearing after World War 2, roughly at the same time as the appearance of the jeepney. It is most likely derived from the Rikuo Type 97 military motorcycle used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines starting at 1941. The motorcycle was essentially a licensed copy of a Harley-Davidson with a sidecar. However, there is also another hypothesis which places the origin of the tricycle to the similarly built \\"trisikad\\", a human-powered cycle rickshaw built in the same configuration as the tricycle. However, the provenance of the trisikad is also unknown. Prior to the tricycles and trisikad, the most common means of mass public transport in the Philippines is a carriage pulled by horses or carabaos known as the kalesa (calesa or carromata in Philippine Spanish). The pulled rickshaw never gained acceptance in the Philippines. Americans tried to introduce it in the early 20th century, but it was strongly opposed by local Filipinos who viewed it as an undignified mode of transport that turned humans into \\"beasts\\". The design and configuration of tricycles vary widely from place to place, but tends towards rough standardization within each municipality. The usual design is a passenger or cargo sidecar fitted to a motorbike, usually on the right of the motorbike. It is rare to find one with a left sidecar. A larger variant of the tricycle with the motorcycle in the center enclosed by a passenger cab with two side benches is known as a \\"motorela.\\" It is found in the islands of Mindanao, Camiguin, and Bohol. Another notable variant are the tricycles of the Batanes Islands which have cabs made from wood and roofed with thatched cogon grass. In Pagadian City, tricycles are also uniquely built with the passenger cab slanting upwards, due to the city's streets that run along steep hills. Tricycles can carry three passengers or more in the sidecar, one or two pillion passengers behind the driver, and even a few on the roof of the sidecar. Tricycles are one of the main contributors to air pollution in the Philippines, which account for 45% of all volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions since majority of them employ two-stroke engines. However, some local governments are working towards phasing out two-stroke tricycles for ones with cleaner four-stroke engines. Tuk-tuks (which are still called tricycles locally despite having a completely different technical composition) and electric variants thereof are now seen in Philippine streets, especially in the city of Manila, called e-trikes, for the latter. Combustion engine tuktuks are locally distributed by Bajaj Auto through dealerships File:Tricycle-Philippines-Dumaguete.JPGMotorized tricycle, Dumaguete City File:Kalibo trike.JPG7-passenger tricycle with large sidecar, Province of Aklan File:Banaue Philippines Local-Taxi-01.jpgTricycle stand, Banaue Municipal Town = Thailand = The auto rickshaw, called tuk- tuk (, ) in Thailand, is a widely used form of urban transport in Bangkok and other Thai cities. The name is onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of a small (often two-cycle) engine. An equivalent English term would be \\"putt-putt\\". It is particularly popular where traffic congestion is a major problem, such as in Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima. Drivers may also use their tuk-tuks to transport fresh produce or other goods around the city in absence of passengers. Bangkok and other cities in Thailand have many tuk-tuks which are a more open variation on the Indian auto rickshaw. About 20,000 tuk-tuks are registered as taxis in Thailand. Bangkok alone is reported to have 9,000 tuk- tuks. Tuk-tuk hua kob (‡∏ï‡∏∏‡πä‡∏Å ‡πÜ ‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏ö; literally: frog-headed tuk tuk) is a unique tuk tuk with a cab looking like a frog's head. Only Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya and Trang have vehicles like this.

They may be used to transport cargo or passengers in the more rural areas. However, in many urban areas the auto rickshaws for passengers are often operated illegally as they are considered unsafe and an eyesore. They are permitted in some towns and cities, however. The Southeast Asian word tuk tuk is transliterated as d≈´ d≈´ chƒì (ÂòüÂòüËΩ¶, or beep beep car) in Chinese.  Europe  = France = A number of tuk-tuks (250 in 2013 according to the Paris Prefecture) are used as an alternative tourist transport system in Paris, some of them being pedal-operated with electric motor assist. They are not yet fully licensed to operate and await customers on the streets. V√©lotaxis were common during the Occupation years in Paris due to fuel restrictions. = Italy = An Ape C (1956‚Äì1967) Auto rickshaws have been commonly used in Italy since the late 1940s, providing a low-cost means of transportation in the post‚ÄìWorld War II years when the country was short of economic resources. The Piaggio Ape (Tukxi), designed by Vespa creator Corradino D'Ascanio and first manufactured in 1948 by the Italian company Piaggio, though primarily designed for carrying freight has also been widely used as an auto rickshaw. It is still extremely popular throughout the country, being particularly useful in the narrow streets found in the center of many little towns in central and southern Italy. Though it no longer has a key role in transportation, Piaggio Ape is still used as a minitaxi in some areas such as the islands of Ischia and Stromboli (on Stromboli no cars are allowed). It has recently been re-launched as a trendy-ecological means of transportation, or, relying on the role the Ape played in the history of Italian design, as a promotional tool. Since 2006 the Ape has been produced under licence in India. =Portugal= Tuk Tuk Taxi in Albufeira Portugal Tuk Tuks are used in the resort city of Albufeira in the Algarve as a novel form of transport for visitors during the tourist season. = United Kingdom = Tuk Tuks & Auto Rickshaws were introduced into the UK by Tukshop in 2004. Founded by mrsteve the first shipments of Bajaj vehicles arrived in Southampton where they were assembled and modified for UK road use. Tuctucs booking auto rickshaw at Brighton Marina In 2006 a British travel writer Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent and her friend Jo Huxster travelled 12,561 miles (20,215 km) with an auto rickshaw from Bangkok to Brighton. With this 98 days' trip they set a Guinness World Record for the longest journey ever with an auto rickshaw.  Central America  Bajaj mototaxis in El Salvador = El Salvador = The mototaxi or moto is the El Salvadoran version of the auto rickshaw. These are most commonly made from the front end and engine of a motorcycle attached to a two-wheeled passenger area in back. Commercially produced models, such as the Indian Bajaj brand, are also employed. = Guatemala = In Guatemala tuk-tuks operate, both as taxis and private vehicles, in Guatemala City, around the island town of Flores, Peten, in the mountain city of Antigua Guatemala, and in many small towns in the mountains. In 2005 the tuk-tuks were prevalent in the Lago de Atitl√°n towns of Panajachel and Santiago Atitl√°n.  North America  Westcoaster Mailster = United States = In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Post Office (replaced in 1971 by the United States Postal Service) used the WestCoaster Mailster, a close relative of the tuk-tuk. Similar vehicles remain in limited use for parking enforcement, mall security, and other niche applications. =Cuba= In Cuba, the autorickshaws are small and look like a coconut, hence the name Cocotaxi. Cocotaxis in Havana, Cuba  South America  = Peru = In Peru, a version of this vehicle is called a motocarhttp://www.peru- motor.com/motocar/ or mototaxi.  Fuel efficiency and pollution  A CNG Auto-rickshaw in New Delhi In July 1998, the Supreme Court of India ordered the Government of Delhi to implement CNG or LPG (Autogas) fuel for all autos and for the entire bus fleet in and around the city. Delhi's air quality has improved with the switch to CNG. Initially, auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi had to wait in long queues for CNG refueling, but the situation improved following an increase in the number of CNG stations. Gradually, many state governments passed similar laws, thus shifting to CNG or LPG vehicles in most large cities to improve air quality and reduce pollution. Certain local governments are pushing for four-stroke engines instead of two-stroke ones. Typical mileage for an Indian-made auto rickshaw is around of petrol. Pakistan has passed a similar law prohibiting auto rickshaws in certain areas. CNG auto rickshaws have started to appear in huge numbers in many Pakistani cities. In January 2007 the Sri Lankan government also banned two-stroke trishaws to reduce air pollution. In the Philippines there are projects to convert carburated two- stroke engines to direct-injected via Envirofit technology. Research has shown LPG or CNG gas direct-injection can be retrofitted to existing engines, in similar fashion to the Envirofit system. In Vigan City majority of tricycles- for-hire as of 2008 are powered by motorcycles with four-stroke engines, as tricycles with two-stroke motorcycles are prevented from receiving operating permits. Direct injection is standard equipment on new machines in India. In March 2009 an international consortium coordinated by the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies initiated a two-year public-private partnership of local and international stakeholders aiming at operating a fleet of 15 hydrogen-fueled three-wheeled vehicles in New Delhi's Pragati Maidan complex. As of January 2011, the project was nearing completion. Hydrogen internal combustion (HICV) use in three-wheelers has only recently being started to be looked into, mainly by developing countries, to decrease local pollution at an affordable cost.Clean Hydrogen Technology for 3-Wheel Transportation in India At some point, Bajaj Auto made a HICV auto rickshaw together with the company \\"Energy Conversion Devices\\". They made a report on it called \\"Clean Hydrogen Technology for 3-Wheel Transportation in India\\" and it stated that the performance was comparable with CNG autos. In 2012, Mahindra & Mahindra showcased their first HICV auto rickshaw, called the Mahindra HyAlfa. The development of the hydrogen-powered rickshaw happened with support from the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies.

The lake is almost long and more than wide. It is a glacial lake, formed in a glacially 'over- deepened' valley. It is the deepest lake in EnglandThe Lake District National Park Authority at . The surface of the lake is about above sea level, while its bottom is over below sea level. It is owned by the National Trust. Surroundings The head of the Wasdale Valley is surrounded by some of the highest mountains in England, including Scafell Pike, Great Gable and Lingmell. The steep slopes on the southeastern side of the lake, leading up to the summits of Whin Rigg and Illgill Head, are known as the \\"Wastwater Screes\\" or on some maps as \\"The Screes\\". These screes formed as a result of ice and weathering erosion on the rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, that form the fells to the east of the lake, towards Eskdale. They are approximately , from top to base, the base being about below the surface of the lake. A path runs the length of the lake, through the boulders and scree fall at the base of the craggy fell-side. On the northwestern side are the cliffs of Buckbarrow (a part of Seatallan) and the upturned-boat shape of Yewbarrow. Wast Water is the source of the River Irt which flows into the Irish Sea near Ravenglass. Both the lake and Wasdale Screes are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and under European Union law as Special Areas of Conservation. Name origin and pronunciation \\"Wastwater\\" comes from \\"Wasdale\\" plus English \\"water\\". \\" 'Wasdale lake' or 'the lake of Vatns√°, lake river'. The present name rather curiously contains the reflexes of both Old Norse 'vatn' 'water', 'lake', and Old English 'w√¶ter' 'water', with the meaning 'lake' probably influenced by the Old Norse 'vatn'. The valley is pronounced as in was, not with a hard a: the name of the lake similarly but with a soft \\"s\\" as in \\"thou wast\\". The lake is named \\"Wast Water\\" on Ordnance Survey maps but the spelling \\"Wastwater\\" is used with roughly equal frequency, including by its owner, the National Trust, along with the Cumbria Tourist Board, and the Lake District National Park Authority. Points of interest =The Lady in the Lake= In 1976, The Wasdale Lady in the Lake, Margaret Hogg, was murdered by her husband and her body was disposed of in the lake. She was found after eight years, with her body preserved like wax due to the lack of oxygen in the water.Lakestay, Wasdale's Lady in the Lake Mystery =Underwater gnomes= In February 2005 it was reported that a \\"gnome garden\\" complete with picket fence had been placed in the lake as a point of interest for divers to explore. It was removed from the bottom of Wastwater after three divers died in the late 1990s. It is thought the divers spent too much time too deep searching for the ornaments. Police divers report a rumour that the garden had been replaced at a depth beyond the lowest they were allowed to dive. PC Kenny McMahon, a member of the North West Police Underwater Search Unit, said =Water extraction= Water was first pumped from the lake during World War II to supply the Royal Ordnance Factory at Drigg. It is pumped to the nearby Sellafield nuclear facility as an industrial water supply.Radioactivity in Food and the Environment, 2010 The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is allowed to extract from the lake a maximum of a day to use on that site. =Favourite view= On 9 September 2007, Wast Water was announced as the winner of a vote to determine \\"Britain's Favourite View\\" by viewers of ITV. =Gallery= File:Wasdale from Wastwater 1.JPGWasdale from the shores of Wastwater.

The term generally refers to the suburbs located on the northern side of Sydney Harbour up to Hornsby and between Middle Harbour and the Lane Cove River.  History  Before British settlement, the Lower North Shore was home to the Gorualgal (Mosman and southern Willoughby) and Cammeraygal (North Sydney and Eastern Lane Cove).http://www.inside-sydney-australia.com/port-jackson.html After the establishment of Sydney in 1788, settlement on the North Shore of the harbour was quite limited. One of the first settlers was James Milson who lived in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli, directly opposite Sydney Cove. The north shore was more rugged than the southern shore and western areas of the harbour and had limited agricultural potential. The early activities in the area included tree felling, boatbuilding and some orchard farming in the limited areas of good soil. The North Shore railway line was built in the 1890s. Access to the Sydney CBD, located on the southern shore of the harbour remained difficult until the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. This led to the commencement of the development of suburbs on the North Shore. https://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/Library_Databases/Heritage_Centre/Leaflets_Walks_Publications/We_will_see_a_town_rising_A_history_of_North_Sydney The four local governments that together form the Lower North Shore (the City of Willoughby and the municipalities of Mosman, Lane Cove and North Sydney) were created from the Parish of Willoughby, a cadastral unit used for land titles that was created in the early years of European settlement. \\"North Sydney\\" was formerly known as St. Leonards. https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32553174?selectedversion=NBD42302430  Geography  Chatswood is a regional administrative and shopping district in the North Shore Suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the North Shore region can be somewhat amorphous and variable. However, the North Shore usually includes suburbs directly north of Sydney Harbour, west of Middle Harbour and Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and suburbs neighbouring Lane Cove National Park to the west of the region. Most of the North Shore suburbs are part of the Hornsby Plateau, a large sandstone plateau overlaid by a system of ridges and gullies. The Plateau begins north of the Port Jackson and runs up until the Hawkesbury River. Thus much of the North Shore is hilly with many steep valleys running down into the harbour and the rivers on either side. Parks and areas of sclerophyll forest are present throughout the area, earning it the nickname \\"the leafy North Shore\\". The Lane Cove National Park, Garigal National Park and Sydney Harbour National Park contain remnant bushland along the Lane Cove River, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour respectively. Bushwalking, abseiling and bouldering opportunities can be found around Lindfield and North Turramurra. Gordon has one of Sydney's largest bat colonies in a bat reserve leading to Middle Harbour. http://www.kmc.nsw.gov.au/About_Ku-ring- gai/Land_and_surrounds/Wildlife_and_fauna/Native_species_profiles/Grey- headed_flying-fox = Upper North Shore = The \\"Upper North Shore\\" usually refers to the suburbs between Roseville and Hornsby, or suburbs adjoining the upper section of Lane Cove National Park, and suburbs located to the West of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. It is located to the north-west of the Sydney CBD. It is made up of suburbs located within the Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Council areas. In 2015, the NSW government proposed merging Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Councils. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers on the North Shore. = Lower North Shore = The Lower North Shore generally refers to suburbs adjacent to the northern side of Sydney Harbour and suburbs west of Middle Harbour, North to Chatswood, New South Wales and suburbs surrounding Lane Cove River such as Woolwich and Riverview. The Lower North Shore roughly corresponds with the Parish of Willoughby, a cadastral unit used for land title purposes. Local government areas that make up the Lower North Shore include Mosman Council, City of Willoughby, Municipality of Lane Cove, North Sydney Council, Municipality of Hunters Hill and parts of City of Ryde. In 2016, the NSW government proposed merging three of the four lower north shore councils (Mosman, Willoughby, and North Sydney councils). In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman local government areas. The other lower north shore council, Lane Cove, was similarly proposed to be merged with nearby Hunters Hill and Ryde councils, but that plan was also eventually abandoned. The Lower North Shore suburbs adjacent to Sydney Harbour are Neutral Bay, Greenwich, Waverton, Wollstonecraft, Mosman, Cremorne, Lavender Bay, Milsons Point, Cammeray, and North Sydney.  Transport  The main transport routes on the North Shore are Military Road, the Pacific Highway, the Warringah Expressway as well as parts of the Pennant Hills Road, Ryde Road, Epping Road and Mona Vale Road. Smaller but major arterial roads on the Upper North Shore include the Eastern Arterial Road at St Ives, East Killara and East Lindfield, the Comenarra Parkway at Thornleigh, Wahroonga, Turramurra, South Turramurra and West Pymble, as well as Lady Game Drive at West Pymble, Gordon, Killara, Lindfield and West Chastwood, providing access to major commercial hubs such as Chatswood. The North Shore & Western Line provides access to the central business district of Sydney over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Many bus routes also serve the area, particularly the lower North Shore, and ferries connect many of the harbourside suburbs with Circular Quay in the central business districthttps://transportnsw.info/document/4247/state-transit-north-shore-and- west-network-map_0.pdf. Much of the North Shore is accessible to Railway Transport with the T1 North Shore line providing rail services between Sydney's Central Business District, North Sydney and Hornsby via Chatswood. The T9 Northern Line also serves parts of the Upper North Shore, while the Sydney Metro Northwest which opened on 26 May 2018, serves the suburbs of Chatswood, North Ryde, Macquarie Park, Macquarie University and Epping before continuing to in the Hills District, replacing the previous Epping to Chatswood railway line after almost 10 years of service. The remaining Sydney Metro City & Southwest stage to the Lower North Shore and , is projected to be completed in 2024. The completed metro line will provide rapid transit between North West Sydney and South West Sydney via the Lower North Shore. Transdev NSW provide frequent bus services to the Upper North Shore.Upper North Shore timetables Transdev NSW Busses on the Lower North Shore are mainly serviced by the State Transit Authority.https://transportnsw.info/document/1695/region- guide-sydney-northern-beaches-lower-north-shore.pdf  Commercial areas  Significant commercial and retail centres on the North Shore include North Sydney, Crows Nest, Macquarie Park, Chatswood, St Leonards, Neutral Bay, Gordon and Hornsby. The North Shore's largest commercial centres are at North Sydney and Chatswood. A number of international companies having their Australian or Asia‚ÄìPacific Headquarters in this part of Sydney. North Sydney does not have any of Sydney's major shopping centres, however, it has a number of speciality stores and caf√©s. Chatswood is one of the largest retail precincts in Sydney, and has a large amount of high density residential buildings. It is home to large shopping centres such as Westfield Chatswood and Chatswood Chase. Nearby Chatswood, Macquarie Park is home to one of Sydney‚Äôs largest shopping centres, Macquarie Centre. Macquarie Park also has a substantial amount of high density residential buildings and office space. St Leonards is another large commercial area featuring mostly office space and apartments.  Attractions  The Lower North Shore has many unique landmarks such as: The Sydney Harbour Bridge, Taronga Zoo in Mosman, Admiralty House (Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia), Kirribilli House (Sydney residence of the Prime Minister of Australia), Luna Park, and Balmoral Beach. At a Sydney or local level, however, landmarks are more plentiful and include: The Lane Cove Azalea Beds, Blues Point Tower, Eden Gardens, the Balmoral Rotunda, the Stanton Library in North Sydney, Lane Cove Plaza, Zenith Towers at Chatswood, Northpoint Tower in North Sydney, Cammeray suspension bridge at Cammeray, Echo Point Park in Roseville Chase, the Royal North Shore Hospital, the Hornsby Water Clock, and 'The Forum' in St Leonards.https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/australia/articles/top-things-to- see-and-do-north-of-the-bridge-in-sydney/ The region is home to hundreds of parks and reserves, including Sydney Harbour National Park and the Lane Cove National Park. Major local sports grounds include North Sydney Oval, the region's largest in capacity, and Chatswood Oval.  Events and celebrations  The Willoughby Spring Festival is held throughout the Willoughby local government area, in September each year. The festival lasts for a month and features over 40 events including live music/entertainment, exhibitions, cultural celebrations, business events and many more community activities.

Taree and nearby Cundletown were settled in 1831 by William Wynter. Since then Taree has grown to a population of 26,381, and is the centre of a significant agricultural district. It is 16 km from the Tasman Sea coast, and 317 km north of Sydney. Taree can be reached by train via the North Coast Railway, and by the Pacific Highway. Taree railway station is on the North Coast line of the NSW TrainLink network. It is serviced by six NSW TrainLink trains daily: three heading to Sydney, another three heading North to Grafton, Casino or Brisbane. Taree is within the local government area of Mid-Coast Council, the state electorate of Myall Lakes and the Federal electorate of Lyne. Name The name Taree is derived from \\"tareebit\\", a Biripi word meaning tree by the river, or more specifically, the Sandpaper Fig (Ficus coronata). History The Biripi were the indigenous people of what is now known as Taree. The Aboriginal population of the Manning River was relatively dense before colonisation by Europeans. In 1826, Assistant Surveyor Henry Dangar was instructed by John Oxley as Surveyor General (and a shareholder in the Australian Agricultural Company) to survey the land between Port Stephens and the Hastings River. During this expedition, Dangar identified that 'Harrington Lake' was a river with two entrances to the sea. Later in 1826, the river was named the Manning River by Robert Dawson for the Deputy Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company, William Manning.The Present State of Australia by Robert Dawson, page 372 In 1829, Governor Darling proclaimed the division of the settlement of the colony of New South Wales into nineteen counties. The northern limit of the settlement was declared to be the Manning River. Taree was laid out as a private town in 1854 by Henry Flett, the son- in-law of William Wynter who had originally settled the area in 1831. had been set aside for the private township and 40 lots were initially sold. Taree was declared a municipality on 26 March 1885 and the first municipal council was elected by the residents.\\"Taree, a short factual history 1854-1954: a century of progress\\", Taree Centenary Celebrations Committee, 1954 In the early 1800s the road from Newcastle to Port Macquarie came via Gloucester and forded the river near Wingham. Boats could not go further upstream than this due to narrowing of the river and rapids. Hence a town formed at Wingham, about a day's ride from Gloucester. Timber getting, especially cedar, ensured goods were brought to Wingham and then shipped to Newcastle and beyond by boat. Coopernook similarly formed a local shipping hub. In 1844, the government of New South Wales had established Wingham as its administrative centre. When the North Coast railway line came through in 1913, it ended initially at Taree. Even before the rest of the line was completed it became apparent that it was safer to send goods by rail to Newcastle and Sydney rather than hazarding the bar at the outlet to the river at Harrington where many ships had been lost. Although connected to the railway, sea transport continued to dominate along the North Coast until the 1930s. This changed when the Martin Bridge replaced the ferry across the Manning River in 1940. River traffic significantly reduced after this, ensuring Taree's place as the centre of business. The oldest surviving building in Taree is the old St Paul's Presbyterian Church, built-in 1869 in the Victorian Gothic Revival style, next door to the current building, in Albert Street.

It has no official boundaries but is roughly bounded by Kensington High Street to the south, Holland Road to the west, Holland Park Avenue to the north, and Kensington Church Street to the east. Adjacent districts are Notting Hill to the north, Earl's Court to the south, and Shepherd's Bush to the northwest. The area is principally composed of tree-lined streets with large Victorian townhouses, and contains many shops, cultural tourist attractions such as the Design Museum, luxury spas, hotels, and restaurants, as well as the embassies of several countries. The street of Holland Park is formed from three linked roads constructed between 1860 and 1880 in projects of master builders William and Francis Radford, who were contracted to build and built over 200 houses in the area. Notable nineteenth-century residential developments in the area include the Royal Crescent and Aubrey House.  History  A map showing the Holland ward of Kensington Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. The district was rural until the 19th century, and most of the area now referred to by the name Holland Park was formerly the grounds of a Jacobean mansion called Holland House. In the later decades of that century the owners of the house sold off the more outlying parts of its grounds for residential development, and the district which evolved took its name from the house. It also included some small areas around the fringes which had never been part of the grounds of Holland House, notably the Phillimore Estate (there are at least four roads with the word Phillimore in their name) and the Campden Hill Square area. In the late 19th century a number of notable artists (including Frederic Leighton, P.R.A. and Val Prinsep) and art collectors lived in the area, known as the Holland Park Circle.  The public park  The park covers about , with a northern half of semi-wild woodland, central section of formal garden areas, and southernmost section used for sport. Holland House is now a fragmentary ruin, having been devastated by incendiary bombing during the Second World War in 1940, but the ruins and the grounds were bought by London County Council in 1952 from the last private owner, the 6th Earl of Ilchester. Today the remains of the house form a backdrop for the open air Holland Park Theatre, which is the home of Opera Holland Park. To the immediate south of the park is the former site of the Commonwealth Institute, now home to the Design Museum. The park contains a caf√©, as well as the Belvedere Restaurant that is attached to the orangery, a giant chess set, a cricket pitch, tennis courts, two Japanese gardens - the Kyoto Garden (1991) and Fukushima Memorial Garden (2012), a youth hostel, a children's playground, squirrels and peacocks. In 2010, the park set aside a section for pigs whose job was to reclaim the area from nettles etc., in order to create another meadow area for wild flowers and fauna. Cattle were used subsequently to similar effect. The Holland Park Ecology Centre (2013), operated by the borough's Ecology Service, offers environmental education programs including nature walks, talks, programs for schools and outdoor activity programs for children.

Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats. For example, about 1 in 30,000 people have monochromatic vision because the color-sensitive cone cells in their eyes do not function. Affected people can distinguish light, dark, and shades of gray but not color. Many species, such as marine mammals, the owl monkey and the Australian sea lion (pictured at right) are monochromats under normal conditions. In humans, absence of color discrimination or poor color discrimination is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, as for example inherited achromatopsia, acquired achromatopsia or inherited blue cone monochromacy. Humans Vision in humans is due to a system that includes rod and cone photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells and the visual cortex in the brain. Color vision is primarily achieved through cone cells. Cone cells are more concentrated in the fovea centralis, which is the central portion of the retina. This allows greater spatial resolution and color discrimination. Rod cells are concentrated in the periphery of the human retina. Rod cells are more light sensitive than cone cells, and are mainly responsible for scotopic (night) vision. Cones in most humans have three types of opsins with different spectral sensitivities which allow for trichromatic color discrimination, whereas rods all have a similar, broad spectral response which does not allow for color discrimination. Because of the distribution of rods and cones in the human eye, people have good color vision near the fovea (where cones are) but not in the periphery (where the rods are). These types of color blindness can be inherited, resulting from alterations in cone pigments or in other proteins needed for the process of phototransduction: # Anomalous trichromacy, when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity but trichromacy (distinguishing color by both the green-red and blue-yellow distinctions) is not fully impaired. # Dichromacy, when one of the cone pigments is missing and colour is reduced to the green-red distinction only or the blue-yellow distinction only. # Monochromacy, when two of the cones are not functional. Vision reduced to blacks, whites, and greys. # Rod monochromacy (achromatopsia), when all three of the cones are non functional and light perception is achieved only with rod cells. Color vision is heavily or completely impaired, vision reduced to seeing only the level of light coming from an object. Dyschromatopsia is a less severe type of achromatopsia. Monochromacy is one of the symptoms of diseases that occur when only one kind of light receptor in the human retina is functional at a particular level of illumination. It is one of the symptoms of either acquired or inherited disease as for example acquired achromatopsia, inherited autosomal recessive achromatopsia and recessive X-linked blue cone monochromacy. There are two basic types of monochromacy. \\"Animals with monochromatic vision may be either rod monochromats or cone monochromats. These monochromats contain photoreceptors which have a single spectral sensitivity curve.\\" *Rod monochromacy (RM), also called congenital complete achromatopsia or total color blindness, is a rare and extremely severe form of an autosomal recessively inherited retinal disorder resulting in severe visual handicap. People with RM have a reduced visual acuity, (usually about 0.1 or 20/200), have total color blindness, photo-aversion and nystagmus. The nystagmus and photo-aversion usually are present during the first months of life, and the prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 1 in 30,000 worldwide. Additionally, since patients with RM have no cone function and normal rod function, a rod monochromat cannot see any color but only shades of grey. *Cone monochromacy (CM) is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only having one functioning type of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues. In humans, who have three types of cones, the short (S, or blue) wavelength sensitive, middle (M, or green) wavelength sensitive and long (L, or red) wavelength sensitive cones have three differing forms of cone monochromacy, named according to the single functioning cone class: #Blue cone monochromacy (BCM), also known as S-cone monochromacy, is an X-linked cone disease. It is a rare congenital stationary cone dysfunction syndrome, affecting less than 1 in 100,000 individuals, and is characterized by the absence of L- and M-cone function. BCM results from mutations in a single red or red‚Äìgreen hybrid opsin gene, mutations in both the red and the green opsin genes or deletions within the adjacent LCR (locus control region) on the X chromosome. #Green cone monochromacy (GCM), also known as M-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and red cones are absent in the fovea. The prevalence of this type of monochromacy is less than 1 in 1 million. #Red cone monochromacy (RCM), also known as L-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and green cones are absent in the fovea. Like GCM, RCM is also present in less than 1 in 1 million people. Animal research studies have shown that the nocturnal wolf and ferret have lower densities of L-cone receptors. *Cone monochromacy, type II, if its existence were established, would be the case in which the retina contains no rods, and only a single type of cone. Such an animal would be unable to see at all at lower levels of illumination, and of course would be unable to distinguish hues. In practice, it is hard to produce an example of such a retina, at least as the normal condition for a species. Animals that are monochromats It used to be confidently claimed that most mammals other than primates were monochromats. In the last half- century, however, evidence of at least dichromatic color vision in a number of mammalian orders has accumulated. While typical mammals are dichromats, with S and L cones, two of the orders of marine mammals, the pinnipeds (which includes the seal, sea lion and walrus) and cetaceans (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals. The same is true of the owl monkeys, genus Aotus. A recent study using through PCR analysis of genes OPN1SW, OPN1LW, and PDE6C determined that all mammals in the order Xenarthra (representing sloths, anteaters and armadillos) developed rod monochromany through a stem ancestor. Researchers Leo Peichl, Guenther Behrmann and Ronald H. H. Kroeger report that of the many animal species studied, there are three carnivores that are cone monochromats: raccoon, crab- eating raccoon and kinkajou and a few rodents are cone monochromats because they are lacking the S-cone. These researchers also report that the animal's living environment also plays a significant role in the animals' eyesight. They use the example of water depth and the smaller amount of sunlight that is visible as one continues to go down. They explain it as follows, \\"Depending on the type of water, the wavelengths penetrating deepest may be short (clear, blue ocean water) or long (turbid, brownish coastal or estuarine water.)\\" Therefore, the variety of visible availability in some animals resulted in them losing their S-cone opsins. Monochromat capability According to Jay Neitz, a color vision researcher at the University of Washington, each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats can detect approximately 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors. Therefore, a monochromat would be able to distinguish about 100 colors.

The river is a tributary of the Parramatta River, winding through a bushland valley. It joins Parramatta River at Greenwich and Woolwich, where together they form an arm of Sydney Harbour, and serves a border along with Middle Harbour separating Sydney's North Shore. Ecology The Lane Cove River rises near Thornleigh and flows generally south for about . Its catchment area is approximately . The upper reaches are in a narrow, forested valley eroded into the North Shore Plateau. Fiddens Wharf was the site of early 19th century logging. The middle reaches are impounded by a weir just upstream of Fullers Bridge. Sections of the valley are forested and are protected within the Lane Cove National Park, an area of ,Guide to New South Wales National Parks, National Parks and Wildlife Service of NSW, 2002, p.34 formerly a State Recreation Area. The lower reaches of the Lane Cove River, downstream from the weir near Fullers Bridge, are tidal and merge into Sydney Harbour at Greenwich and Woolwich. There are significant areas of mangrove communities along the shores. The confluence of the river is with Scout Creek in Lane Cove National Park at Cheltenham. At North Epping, still within the confines of the national park, it is joined by Devlins Creek from the south and Terrys Creek near Macquarie Park. Southwest of Killara and Lindfield, the width of the river expands, continuing south through Lane Cove River National Park, towards the suburbs of Linley Point and Riverview, before finally reaching its mouth between Greenwich Point and Woolwich, where it merges with Parramatta River and soon after becomes part of Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour. Devlin Creek was named after the Devlin family, who lived in Willandra, a historical house in Ryde. Register of the National Estate The area surrounding the river, no more than wide, is called Lane Cove National Park, and is a site of ecological importance, listed on the Australian Register of the National Estate. It contains an endangered community of fungi, some species of which have still not been classified. A popular caravan park and campground known as Lane Cove River Tourist Park is located on the western side of the valley above the river. Great North Walk The Lane Cove River is the site of many old trails and tracks, some of which have survived from logging days. They are now used for recreational purposes. Some of them have been incorporated into the Great North Walk, a long distance walking trail from Sydney to Newcastle. This trail passes along the Lane Cove River between Boronia Avenue, Hunters Hill, and Thornleigh Oval, Thornleigh.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.5-30 On the east side of Thornleigh Oval, the trail makes use of Lorna Pass, a track built during the Depression of the 1930s to provide relief work. The pass was named after Lorna Brand, who raised money for the work. Another trail, the Lane Cove Valley Walk, stretches from Thornleigh to Lindfield. Fairyland From 1913 to the early 1970s, the Swan family operated a picnic area called Fairyland, which was located on the banks of the river, upstream from Epping Road. The area was originally a market garden, but the family turned it into a picnic area when they realized the commercial potential. Facilities were developed to the point where Fairyland had its own footbridge, BBQ fireplaces, boat swing, razzle dazzle ride, shelter, dance hall and wharf.A History of North Ryde 1850-1950 (published by North Ryde Public School) 1986, p.14 The area has now returned to nature and is contained within the Lane Cove National Park. The Great North Walk passes through it. Cultural items of significance Harry Smith was a businessman who owned land in what is now the Marsfield area. Smith created a picnic area in a section of his property he called Curzon Park, which bordered the Lane Cove River and consisted of eighty acres of bushland.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory 46th Edition, 1982, Map 64 The picnic area has long since returned to nature, but a set of stone steps can still be seen at the top of the escarpment above the river. It is almost certain that Smith had these steps built to provide access to the picnic area. This is supported by a news item from 1899, which states that a set of stone steps went down to the picnic area.Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate, 4 April 1899, p.8 Smith also had a quarry in the area, near the present location of Talavera Road, from which he obtained the stone to build his mansion, Curzon Hall. The latter was built circa 1899 and is located at the intersection of Balaclava and Agincourt Roads. The name Curzon came from his wife's name: Isabella Curzon Webb. The building was purchased by the Vincentian Fathers in 1922 and turned into a Catholic seminary. In 1983 it was acquired for business purposes and became a function centre. Curzon Hall is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register as a site of significance. Smith is remembered as a philanthropist who allowed the public to use the picnic area free of charge, and who built the public school in Marsfield. He died in 1913. The river is known for being the site of the mysterious deaths of Dr Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler on 1 January 1963. The cause of their deaths has never been established; but there is a strong theory that the two deaths may have been caused by accidental hydrogen sulphide poisoning, due to the build-up of the poisonous gas beneath the river bed that formed both naturally and by pollutants from nearby factories along the river.

Greenwich is located north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Lane Cove. The suburb occupies a peninsula on the northern side of Sydney Harbour, at the opening of the Lane Cove River. The suburb features harbour views, a few pockets of bushland, shops, restaurants, cafes and a harbour swimming pool with shark net. History The suburb's name is derived from its namesake Greenwich, by the banks of the River Thames in London. Parramatta River had been known as the 'Thames of the Antipodes' and other nearby suburbs were also named after Thames localities of Putney, Woolwich and Henley. left The Cammeraygal clan of the Kuringgai people were the first inhabitants of the Greenwich area, and lived along the foreshores of the harbour, hunting in the hinterland and trading with other clans. The first known occasion when a European went to the area was in 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Ball passed through the area while returning from a trip to the Middle Harbour area. Land grants began in 1794 and industries developed in the area during the 1830s.Lane Cove Council Website:retrieved 21 October 2009 Aboriginal people were still present in the 1820s, but disease and displacement had driven them out by the 1860s. Early land grants were made to Samuel Lightfoot, a convict, in 1794, and William Gore, public servant, in 1813. Gore built a road from his farm at Artarmon to Gore Cove, which was the beginning of Greenwich Road. In the 1830s George Green and his father Amaziah bought land in Greenwich, with access to the harbour, and along with others began a shipbuilding industry on the foreshore. When Green subdivided his land in 1840, the name 'Greenwich' was mentioned for the first time. thumb Greenwich House‚Äîa two-storey Georgian home made from sandstone blocks‚Äîwas built on the estate of George Green in 1836 and still stands on the corner of George and St Lawrence Streets.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 116 The house was eventually sold, by the mortgage holders, to Gother Kerr Mann in the early 1850s, and remained in that family until 1949. The eastern tip of Greenwich is called Manns Point, after Gother Kerr Mann (1809‚Äì1899). Mann was the first Chief Commissioner for Railways, the Superintendent of convicts at Cockatoo Island and the builder of Fitzroy Dock. By the early 1880s Greenwich Point already had a post office, general store, and school, with around 16 houses. Upper Greenwich took longer to develop, with most of the area still virgin bush. But with the improvement in north shore roads, and increasing subdivision in upper Greenwich, some grander houses were built near River Road, and new estates were subdivided as Greenwich became a commuter suburb. Between the 1880s and the 1940s a number of successful dairies operated in Greenwich, run by the Anderson, Hogan, Mather and Clarke families. The milk from Anderson's was delivered by boat along the Lane Cove River and to the residents of Cockatoo Island. Hogan's dairy at Chisholm Street had 300 cows by the time it closed in 1928. Clarke's dairy was on the site of the current golf course. Light industry was set up along the foreshores of Greenwich, including Shipbuilding, brickmaking, quarrying, and the Patent Asphaltum Company which refined bitumen and manufactured building materials. The Shell Transport and Trading Company opened a terminal at Gore Bay in 1901, importing and distributing petroleum products. It grew over time to include the sites of the Patent Asphaltum works, and several wharves, as well as the shale oil refining works of John Fell & Co. By the late 1930s, over 500 workers were employed at the Shell site. Today fuel products unloaded at Gore Bay are transferred by an underground pipe to the Clyde Refinery.About Us Viva Energy Australia Greenwich was the northern portal of the first tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel was dug by the New South Wales Government Railways to Birchgrove to provide a reliable way to get electricity from the Pyrmont Power Station to the tram network on the north shore. Cables had previously been laid on the floor of the harbour, but damaged by ships dragging their anchors. The tunnel was commenced in 1913 and excavated by hand, completed in 1924. Part of the tunnel is through the silt at the bottom of the river, so required constant pumping until it was allowed to flood in 1930 and abandoned from 1969. The tunnel was excavated almost entirely from the Greenwich side, as the residents on Long Nose Point at Balmain (now Birchgrove) successfully objected to the noise of the compressor powering pneumatic drills. There were both the tunnel portal and a vertical shaft nearer the water used for excavation. The tunnel passes between the floor of the harbour and the Balmain coal mine further below the harbour. The tunnel is excavated entirely through Hawkesbury sandstone which lies below the silt and sediment which form the floor of the harbour. At its lowest point, it is below sea level.  Heritage listings  Greenwich has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 95 River Road: Pallister, Greenwich * Greenwich Infants School * Sydney Harbour railway electricity tunnel Education Greenwich Public School is a local primary school with two separate campuses located 1.5 kilometres apart. It was opened in 1876 as a provisional school, after repeated petitions from residents, and became a public school in 1880, with a new building and site in Mitchell Street in 1881. In 1909 the school moved to the site of the current infants school in Greenwich Road, and the primary school moved to Kingslangley Road in 1950.

Its relative, the slender-billed kite, is now again placed in Helicolestes, making the genus Rostrhamus monotypic. Usually, it is placed in the milvine kites, but the validity of that group is under investigation. Description Adult female Snail kites are long with a wingspan. They weigh from . There is very limited sexual dimorphism, with the female averaging only 3% larger than the male. They have long, broad, and rounded wings, which measure each. Its tail is long, at , with a white rump and undertail coverts. The dark, deeply hooked beak, measuring is an adaptation to its diet. The tarsus is relatively long as well, measuring . The adult male has dark blue-gray plumage with darker flight feathers. The legs and cere are red. The adult female has dark brown upperparts and heavily streaked pale underparts. She has a whitish face with darker areas behind and above the eye. The legs and cere are yellow or orange. The immature is similar to adult female, but the crown is streaked. It flies slowly with its head facing downwards, looking for its main food, the large apple snails. For this reason, it is considered a molluscivore. Taxonomy Lerner and Mindell (2005) found R. sociabilis sister to Geranospiza caerulescens, and that those two along with Ictinea plumbea were basal to both the buteogallus and buteo clades. They concluded that Rostrhamus belonged in Buteoninae (sensu stricto) and not in Milvinae, but noted that more investigation was needed. Distribution and ecology The snail kite breeds in tropical South America, the Caribbean, and central and southern Florida in the United States. It is resident all-year in most of its range, but the southernmost population migrates north in winter and the Caribbean birds disperse widely outside the breeding season. It nests in a bush or on the ground, laying 3‚Äì4 eggs. The snail kite is a locally endangered species in the Florida Everglades, with a population of less than 400 breeding pairs. Research has demonstrated that water-level control in the Everglades is depleting the population of apple snails. However, this species is not generally threatened over its extensive range. Adult male Everglades snail kite in Joe Overstreet Landing, Florida. In fact, it might be locally increasing in numbers, such as in Central America. In El Salvador, it was first recorded in 1996. Since then, it has been regularly sighted, including immature birds, suggesting a resident breeding population might already exist in that country. On the other hand, most records are outside the breeding season, more indicative of post-breeding dispersal. In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at Embalse Cerr√≥n Grande, Laguna El Jocotal, and especially Lago de G√ºija. Pomacea flagellata apple snails were propagated in El Salvador between 1982 and 1986 as food for fish stocks, and it seems that the widespread presence of high numbers of these snails has not gone unnoticed by the snail kite. This is a gregarious bird of freshwater wetlands, forming large winter roosts. Its diet consists almost exclusively of apple snails. Snail kites have been observed eating other prey items in Florida, including crayfish in the genus Procambarus and black crappie. It is believed that snail kites turn to these alternatives only when apple snails become scarce, such as during drought, but further study is needed. On 14 May 2007, a birdwatcher photographed a snail kite feeding at a red swamp crayfish farm in Clarendon County, South Carolina.

For instance, on one occasion Trurl creates an entity capable of extracting accurate information from the random motion of gas particles, which he calls a \\"Demon of the Second Kind\\". He describes the \\"Demon of the First Kind\\" as a Maxwell's demon. On another, the two constructors re-arrange stars near their home planet in order to advertise. The duo are best friends and rivals. When they are not busy constructing revolutionary mechanisms at home, they travel the universe, aiding those in need. As the characters are firmly established as good and righteous, they take no shame in accepting handsome rewards for their services. If rewards were promised and not delivered, the constructors may even severely punish those who deceived them. The world and its inhabitants The universe of The Cyberiad is pseudo-medieval. There are kingdoms, knights, princesses, and even dragons in abundance. Robots are usually anthropomorphic, to the point of being divided into sexes. Love and marriage are possible. Physical and mental disabilities, old age and death, particularly in case of accidents or murder, are also common, though mechanical language is used to describe them. Death is theoretically avoidable (by means of repair), and sometimes even reversible. In fact, the teacher of Trurl and Klapaucius, Master Cerebron, is deceased, but can still be reanimated at his tomb. The level of technology of the vast majority of inhabitants is pseudo-Medieval also, with swords, robotic steeds, and gallows widespread. With this co-exist space travel, extremely advanced technology made by the Constructors and futuristic weapons and devices used or mentioned on occasion. There even exists a civilization that has achieved the \\"HPLD\\" ‚Äì Highest Possible Level of Development. Romantic stories Some stories are basically self-conscious parodies of romantic novels about knights, with more profound issues of psychology and social dynamics under a cartoonish and swashbuckling facade. Three of them were published in an earlier collection, Fables for Robots. A typical example is the fairy tale O kr√≥lewiczu Ferrycym i kr√≥lewnie Krystalii (\\"Prince Ferrix and the Princess Crystal\\"). A princely (robotic) knight falls in love with a beautiful (robotic) princess. Unfortunately, the princess is somewhat eccentric, and is captivated by stories of an alien non-robotic, \\"paleface\\" civilization (the humans). She declares that she will only marry a \\"paleface\\". Therefore, the knight decides to masquerade as a paleface. He covers himself with mud, starting to resemble one, and then comes to woo her. Meanwhile, a real \\"paleface\\" captive arrives, given as a gift to the king. It immediately becomes obvious to the princess who is the \\"muddier\\" one, but the \\"paleface\\" turns out to be too squishy and overall disgusting. Not wanting to back down at the last minute, however, the princess declares a joust between the two suitors to select the worthier one. When the \\"paleface\\" charges at the robot, he splatters himself on the latter's metal chest, revealing the metallic body to all. The princess, beholding the beauty of the exposed robot (compared with the ugliness of the \\"paleface\\"), changes her mind. The knight and the princess live happily ever after. Stories involving technology and the Constructors Most of the stories involve Trurl and Klapaucius using their extraordinary technological abilities to help the inhabitants of the medieval planets, usually involving neutralizing tyrants. Trurl and Klapaucius come to a planet ruled by a king who loves hunting. He has already \\"conquered\\" all the most dangerous of predators, and now hires constructors (engineers) to make new, mighty robotic beasts for him to hunt. He has already executed all of the previous constructors who visited because they could not build beasts that would be challenging enough to hunt. When the two famous Constructors arrive, they are arrested and ordered to construct a worthy foe for the king within twelve days. The two face a dilemma: if they make something that the king will kill, they will be executed by the mad king. But if the king himself is killed, then they will be executed, for the next king will be pressured to show his respect for the previous. They solve the problem by building an animal that survives the hunt (involving both cyber-hounds and nuclear tipped missiles unleashed upon it, in the characteristic cartoonish manner) and takes the king hostage by, nothing less, turning into several police officers and presenting an order for his arrest. All the king's men fail to find and free the king (partially because in searching for the fake policemen one half of the real police force arrests the other half), and he is released only after the Constructors' numerous demands are met. On another occasion, Trurl and Klapaucius are captured by an interstellar \\"PHT\\" pirate. Trurl offers to build a machine capable of turning hydrogen into gold (something he can do manually, which he demonstrates by hand, mixing up protons and putting electrons around). However, the pirate turns out to have a PhD and cares not for the riches, but for knowledge (and in fact points out that gold becomes cheap if it is abundant). Trurl therefore makes a modified Maxwell's demon for him, an entity that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that is, coincidentally, encoded in their random perturbations. This way, all the information in the universe becomes easily available. The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely useless (although strictly factual) he is buried under the endless rolls of tape, ceasing to bother anyone. Stories involving the search for happiness and ideal society Lem was very interested in the issue of the nature of an ideal society: compare his Peace on Earth, The Futurological Congress and Observation on the Spot. The Highest Possible Level of Development civilization. A gravely injured hermit comes to Trurl's house and tells Trurl of Klapaucius's adventure: Klapaucius wanders across an old robot, who tells him that he has logically deduced the existence of a civilization that reached the highest possible level of development (hence \\"HPLD\\"). He has inferred the existence of such a civilization by figuring that if there are different stages of development, there will be one that is the highest. He was then faced with a problem of identifying that one; as he noted, everyone claimed that theirs was the HPLD. Upon much research and thought, he decided that the only way to find it is by looking for a \\"wonder\\", i.e. something that has no rational explanation. Eventually Klapaucius discovers one such wonder: a star in the shape of a cube, orbited by a planet also shaped like a cube with the huge letters HPLD written on it. He lands and meets its inhabitants: a group of about 100 individuals lying around doing nothing. When the HPLDs grow tired with Klapaucius's efforts to extract answers from them, they teleport him and his ship far into outer space, albeit after filling the ship with gifts. Seeing how he will not get anywhere this way, Klapaucius constructs a massive machine capable of simulating the entire universe, including a member of the HPLD civilization. Upon questioning the simulation, he is informed that over six million such interrogations took place in the past. The simulation also reveals that the civilization in question has long since achieved the HPLD, and thus has nothing else to strive for. When Klapaucius asks why the HPLD civilization does not continuously engage in helping other, less advanced civilizations, the simulation explains that their attempts to do so in the past have proven extremely counter- productive. For instance, having dropped some millions of wish-fulfilling devices on a planet, they saw it blow up in a matter of hours. Eventually, the HPLD representative provides Klapaucius with the formula for \\"Altruizine\\" ‚Äì a substance that allows individuals within a limited area to completely share all feelings and emotions, including both pain and joy. The idea behind Altruizine is that people who feel each other's pain as their own should treat each other as they would themselves. Altruizine. Klapaucius produces a large quantity of the substance and sends the above-mentioned hermit (who is eager to help others) in human guise to experiment on the population of a single planet. Some of the results include villagers feeling the birth pains of a cow, depressed people being violently attacked and driven off and a crowd storming the house of the newlyweds to vicariously participate in their unaccustomed sensations. Eventually, the hermit is identified for a robot (because he does not feel the humans' pain), is thoroughly beaten and tortured, then shot into outer space via a cannon. He then lands near Trurl's house, where the story began. Concluding his tale, the hermit assures Trurl that his thirst for altruism has vanished. Trurl and the construction of happy worlds. Trurl is not deterred by the cautionary tale of altruizine and decides to build a race of robots happy by design. His first attempt are a culture of robots who are not capable of being unhappy (e.g. they are happy if seriously beaten up). Klapaucius ridicules this. Next step is a collectivistic culture dedicated to common happiness. When Trurl and Klapaucius visit them, they are drafted by the Ministry of Felicity and made to smile, sing, and otherwise be happy, in fixed ranks (with other inhabitants). Trurl annihilates both failed cultures and tries to build a perfect society in a small box. The inhabitants of the box develop a religion saying that their box is the most perfect part of the universe and prepare to make a hole in it in order to bring everyone outside the Box into its perfection, by force if needed. Trurl disposes of them and decides that he needs more variety in his experiments and smaller scale for safety. He creates hundreds of miniature worlds on microscope slides (i.e. he has to observe them through a microscope). These microworlds progress rapidly, some dying out in revolutions and wars, and some developing as regular civilizations without any of them showing any intrinsic perfection or happiness. They do achieve inter-slide travel though, and many of these worlds are later destroyed by rats. Eventually, Trurl gets tired of all the work and builds a computer that will contain a programmatic clone of his mind that would do the research for him. Instead of building new worlds, the computer sets about expanding itself. When Trurl eventually forces it to stop building itself and start working, the clone-Trurl tells him that he has already created many sub-Trurl programs to do the work and tells him stories about their research (which Trurl later finds out is bogus). Trurl destroys the computer and temporarily stops looking for universal happiness.

Daniel Hill also served as the Ombudsman of Ontario. He published a still seminal work about Black history in Canada: The Freedom Seekers: Blacks in Early Canada. Hill's mother, Donna Mae Bender, came from a white Republican family in Oak Park, Illinois, and graduated from Oberlin College. She met his father in Washington, D.C., where she worked for a Democratic US Senator and became a civil rights activist. In the early 1950s in Toronto, Donna Hill worked as a human rights activist for the city's Labor Committee for Human Rights. She lobbied the Ontario government to enact anti- discrimination legislation. She also wrote about Black Canadian history; her A Black Man's Toronto, 1914-1980: The Reminiscences of Harry Gairey (1980) was published by the Multicultural History Society of Ontario. Daniel and Donna Hill co-founded The Ontario Black History Society with Wilson O. Brooks and other friends. Lawrence Hill was born as the second son, and grew up with his brother Dan and sister Karen in the predominantly white Toronto suburb of Don Mills. Dan Hill became a singer-songwriter and writer, and their sister, the late Karen Hill (1958-2014), was also a writer. Her novel, short stories, poems and an essay are still to be published.

Writing career Hill's first passion was running, but he was unable to realize his dreams of becoming an elite athlete and winning an Olympic gold medal in the 5,000 meters. He threw himself into writing in his teenage years and completed his first story at the early age of 14. After receiving his B.A. in economics at Laval University, Hill worked for four years as a full-time newspaper reporter for The Globe and Mail, and later for The Winnipeg Free Press. He became the parliamentary bureau chief for the newspaper in Ottawa, covering Parliament, the Supreme Court of Canada and a wide range of cultural, economic and social issues. Resigning from his position as parliamentary bureau chief in 1986, Hill moved to Spain to begin writing fiction full-time. The work of his parents in the human rights movement and Black history greatly influenced Hill's work related to identity and belonging as a writer. Hill curated and wrote the exhibit on his father for the Ontario Archives, called The Freedom Seeker: The Life and Times of Daniel G. Hill.

Warrawee is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Warrawee is located 15 kilometres north-west of the Sydney Central Business District in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007, Map 222 Warrawee is predominantly a small residential suburb with few commercial entities. Notably, its railway station provides no commercial activity which is uncommon in the Sydney train network. This should not be confused with Wirawee, the fictional small country town in the Tomorrow series of books for young people by John Marsden and the film derived from the first book, Tomorrow when the war began. History Warrawee is believed to have come from an Aboriginal word meaning rest a while, stop here or to stand.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia The suburb is rich in architectural history, with a number of houses designed by prominent architects. The earliest significant homes were Pibrac (1888), Cheddington (1890) and Wirepe (1893), all very fine houses. In 1888, the public servant and patron of exploration Frederick Ecclestone du Faur built his house Pibrac in Pibrac Avenue. The house was designed by John Horbury Hunt, a Canadian architect who settled in Australia and favoured the Arts and Crafts style, as well as the North American Shingle style, which he introduced to Australia. Later alterations were carried out by B.J. Waterhouse. The house is composed predominantly of timber, with extensive use of timber shingles, on a sandstone base. It is considered a good example of Hunt's work and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/33 Cheddington, the oldest home in established Hastings Road, is also attributed to Horbury Hunt, of brick and slate, with characteristic shingling. Wirepe, designed by M.B. Halligan for architect Walter Traill, used deep verandahs and high ceilings to elicit a homestead atmosphere, with fine corbelled chimneys and cedar shingles. The brickwork is of Colonial Bond design, and the house sits at the heart of the Ku-ring-gai heritage precinct on Hastings Road. Upton Grey (now Kooyong) was built in 1894 to a John Sulman design; its English features are a local landmark. Across the century it has served as a government social services home, a CSIRO field station, and a boarding house for Knox Grammar School. It is now in private hands and retains features replicated at Sulman's important Ingleholme. \\"Exley House\\" at Finlay Road Warrawee, was designed by Harry Seidler in 1957 for Cecil Exley ‚Äî an engineer with the Sydney Water Board ‚Äî and his wife. The three bedrooms, two bathroom home is the only red-brick single storey dwelling that Harry Seidler ever designed and the only one still in its original condition. As all North Shore suburbs with aboriginal names, Warrawee was the name of a railway station which became attached to the surrounding suburb. Warrawee had developed in the 1900s as an exclusive residential district with no shops, offices, post office, public school, churches or through roads.Paul Davis, November 2010, Kuring-Gai Potential Heritage Conservation Areas North Review \\"HCA 23 ‚Äì Warrawee\\" retrieved 16 April 2012.Knox Grammar was founded at Earlston, a Warrawee property across the railway line, in 1923, senior school 1924. All the blocks were kept to between one and four acres and the form of houses tightly controlled. See especially p. 27. Joseph Beresford Grant used his money to guarantee the exclusiveness of the development. Transport The Pacific Highway is the main arterial road. Warrawee railway station is on the North Shore & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. The railway station built in 1900 was the last one built on the North Shore Line before it was extended to North Sydney. Local residents had to fight the railway commissioners for a railway station, that is only one kilometre from Wahroonga. At the , 27% of employed people travelled to work on public transport compared to 10% average for all of Australia, while 51% travelled by car (either as driver or as passenger) compared to 66% nationally.  Demographics  At the , the suburb of Warrawee recorded a population of 2,995 people. Of these: *Age distribution: The median age of Warrawee residents was 41 years. Children aged under 15 years made up 18.6% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 15.5% of the population. *Ethnic diversity: More than half (60.9%) of residents were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were England 7%, China 5.6%, South Africa 2.9%, Korea 2.6% and India 2.2%. The most common ancestries in Warrawee were English 27.8%, Australian 19.8%, Chinese 8.9%, Scottish 8.1% and Irish 7.8%. *Finances: The median weekly household income was $3,085, more than double the national median of $1,438.

The North Shore Line extends from Sydney Central station through the western limb of the City Circle, across the Sydney Harbour Bridge and through the North Shore area to Hornsby where it joins the Main North Line. Most services on the line are part of the T1 North Shore & Western Line, with some services to Wyong during peak hours. History Aerial view of construction of the northern approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The original railway alignment and construction work on the realignment for extension across the bridge can both be seen. The North Shore Line was opened on 1 January 1890 as a single track between Hornsby and St Leonards. The line was extended to the Sydney Harbour foreshore at Milsons Point on 1 May 1893. Transport between this original Milsons Point station and central Sydney was by ferry boat. Most of the North Shore line was duplicated between 1900 and 1909. In 1927 the line was converted to electric operation using a 1500 volt DC, overhead supply. The construction works for the Sydney Harbour Bridge necessitated truncation of the southern terminus from Milsons Point to Lavender Bay. When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened on 19 March 1932 a new Milsons Point station (on the bridge approach) came into operation and the North Shore Line was extended through it and over the Sydney Harbour Bridge to link with the underground lines of central Sydney. The result is that the two ends of the North Shore Line link to the Sydney railway system at Central and Hornsby. After 1932 the original Lavender Bay station became a storage depot for electric trains, and the line connecting Lavender Bay to the North Shore line was reduced to single track. This line joins the current North Shore line at Waverton station. In 2009, a second connection to the Main Northern line was added with the opening to the Epping to Chatswood railway line. This connecting line was removed and incorporated into the Sydney Metro in 2019. The North Shore Line is now a major commuter artery between the North Shore and central Sydney. In early years, Old Milsons Point, Bay Road, St Leonards, Chatswood, Lindfield, Gordon, Pymble, Turramurra, Wahroonga and Hornsby stations had goods yards. All but St Leonards, Chatswood and Hornsby yards had disappeared by mid-twentieth century, and the latter three did not survive into the late twentieth century.  Route  The North Shore line officially starts at Central, with a junction with the Main Suburban line south of the Flying Junctions. The line runs through Central, then goes underground alongside the City Circle, with stations at Town Hall and Wynyard. There is a crossover north of Wynyard allowing southbound trains to terminate when there is trackwork in the City Circle. After Wynyard, the line emerges onto the western side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Milsons Point station. The line continues for a short distance to North Sydney station, which has 4 platforms. The outer two tracks are for through services, while the inner two tracks are loop lines for terminating trains. After North Sydney, the line snakes its way through Sydney's lower North Shore, passing Waverton, Wollstonecraft, St Leonards and Artamon stations. At Waverton is the small junction with the Lavender Bay line, providing access to Lavender Bay/North Sydney Sidings. This section of line also has the sharpest curve on Sydney's suburban network, at Wollstonecraft of . At Chatswood, there are 4 platforms, with the inner two used by Sydney Metro Northwest and formerly to enter the Epping to Chatswood rail link. The line continues up the North Shore region, with stations at Roseville, Lindfield, Killara, Gordon, Pymble, Turramurra, Warrawee, Wahroonga and Waitara. Lindfield has an additional bay platform in the centre, used to terminate trains from the south. A similar arrangement exists at Gordon, where the centre platform is connected to a loop line that can terminate trains in both directions. After Waitara, the line proceeds to Hornsby, where there is a junction with the Main Northern Line and Hornsby Maintenance Centre.

Lane Cove is nine kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Lane Cove Council. Lane Cove West and Lane Cove North are separate suburbs. Lane Cove occupies a peninsula on the northern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), at the opening of the Lane Cove River. The regional administrative and shopping hub of Chatswood is located 3 kilometres away, along with Macquarie Park 4 kilometres away.  History  Suburban area of Lane Cove There are a number of possibilities of the origin of the name 'Lane Cove'. The first written use of the name was by Lieutenant William Bradley after he had just sailed along the river in 1788. Some have argued that it was named after Lieutenant Michael Lane, a respected cartographer, who had once worked with Captain Cook. Others say that it was in honour of John Lane, who was the son of the London Lord Mayor at the time as well as a good friend of the first Governor, Arthur Phillip. In any case, the name stuck, and by the 1800s was being used to refer to all the land north of the river. =Aboriginal culture= Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet, the area in which Lane Cove is situated was inhabited by the Cam-mer-ray-gal Group of the Ku-ring-gai Aboriginal Tribe. The group, which inhabited the north shore of Port Jackson, was one of the largest in the Sydney area. =European settlement= Lieutenant Ralph Clark was the first European to land, a short distance from the entrance to the Lane Cove River on 14 February 1790. There were land grants in 1794 to some privates and non-commissioned officers in the New South Wales Corps, although few of these grants were actually settled as the steep, timbered land was not particularly habitable. However, Lane Cove was an excellent source for timber and other commodities that the settlers required. During the 19th century, farms and dairies were also established. There were also many industrial and manufacturing factories constructed around Greenwich. A detailed history of the early years of Lane Cove is found in Ball. John and Pam, Revisiting the early history of Lane Cove, 2010, Oughtershaw Press, . 253 pages. Most of the residential growth in the area however occurred after World War II when returning soldiers were granted blocks of land around Lane Cove. The land value, which was relatively cheap during this time, surged during the 1980s and 1990s when the water views, large suburban blocks, ease of transport and quiet streets became popular.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.146 , page 146 In 2005, Lane Cove briefly caught the attention of the world's press when part of an apartment block (which is now classified as being in the new suburb of North Lane Cove) collapsed into an excavation for the Lane Cove Tunnel and a pet bird in the evacuated block was rescued by a robot.; Lane Cove North was split off to become a separate suburb on 20 January 2006. =Former tram line= The tram service to Lane Cove opened as an electric line from Crows Nest in February 1900, with trams connecting with other electric services at Ridge St. It was initially opened as far as Gore Hill and extended to Lane Cove in March, 1909. Some through services operated to and from Milsons Point.D Keenan: The North Sydney lines of the Sydney tramway system. Transit Press November 1987 In September 1909, a new line was opened from McMahons Point to Victoria Cross, North Sydney and a new direct route was opened via what is now the Pacific Highway from Victoria Cross to Crows Nest. Services to Lane Cove and Chatswood were altered to operate to and from McMahons Point via the new direct route to Crows Nest, in conjunction with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. In March, 1932 the Sydney Harbour Bridge with its associated railway and tramway tracks was opened and services from Lane Cove to the CBD were diverted to operate to and from Wynyard Station via the Sydney Harbour Bridge route. Trams entered Wynyard station via a tunnel entrance at the south-eastern pylon of the bridge. From Lane Cove a cross regional service to Balmoral was also available. Upon departure from the Lane Cove terminus opposite the council chambers, trams travelled north on Longueville Road turning right onto the Pacific Highway. At Crows Nest, separate lines branched left onto Falcon Street, travelling through Cammeray, Neutral Bay, Cremorne Junction and Mosman before Joining Military Road. The line then split into two separate lines at the intersection of Middle Head Road and Bradleys Head Road. Turning left into Gordon Street off Middle Head Road, the line then entered on to its own off road reservation, crossing several small residential streets as it wound its way down to Henry Plunkett Reserve, entering The Esplanade near the corner of Botanic Road and terminating near Hunters Parade.Gregory's Street Directory 1955, Map 58, 59, 75  Heritage listings  Lane Cove has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 334 Burns Bay Road: Carisbrook, Lane Cove  Commercial area  Lane Cove Town Hall Although Lane Cove contains residential, it contains some commercial and industrial. Lane Cove has a shopping centre that includes a pedestrian plaza at the eastern end of Burns Bay Road, where it meets Longueville Road. There is a Coles supermarket, a Woolworths supermarket, a pub and a number of small specialty stores in this area, as well as a large number of restaurants and cafes. At the end of Longueville Road is the Lane Cove Businessman's Club which is the only local Club in the Area. Several large businesses are located in Lane Cove including the Australian headquarters of statistical software company SAS, the recording house for Warner Bros., Festival Mushroom Records, as well as Bluescope Steels Marketing branch in Lane Cove West. = Lane Cove Library = The interior of Lane Cove Library in 2020 Lane Cove Library is located at Library Walk, Lane Cove. The library received a major update with an extension/refurbishment which increased Library space from 1,203 sq m to 3,301 sq m - exceeding state benchmarks. =Greenwich Library= A small Branch Library is located at Greenwich. =Lane Cove Aquatic Centre= Lane Cove Aquatic Centre contains a 50-metre swimming pool, a 25-metre swimming pool, a shallow pool for toddlers and young children and a well equipped gym. There are also water springs, a sauna, spa and a kiosk.  Transport  The Gore Hill Freeway, which brings traffic from the city, the airport and southern suburbs connects to two major roads at Lane Cove - the Pacific Highway which travels north and Epping Road which goes north-west. The traffic problems at these intersections led to the construction of the Lane Cove Tunnel, which takes vehicles straight from the Gore Hill Expressway to the M2. Cars can now travel from the Baulkham Hills Shire to the airport without having to pass a single set of traffic lights (although there are tolls to pay in each direction). Since the opening of the Lane Cove Tunnel, two lanes of Epping Road between Mowbray Road and Lane Cove have been removed, with the left lane in each direction becoming a Bus Lane, reducing Epping Road in some sections to one lane in each direction for general traffic and increasing congestion. Getting in and out of Lane Cove can take 20 - 30 minutes in a car in peak hour. Lane Cove was the terminus of one of Sydney's northern tram lines, which closed in the late 1950s. Trams operated to Wynyard in the city and Balmoral via Crows Nest. The current 254 bus route largely follows the city route from Longueville Road to Wynyard via Crows Nest and North Sydney. The now-defunct 140 bus route From Manly to Epping follows a large section of the old Balmoral route. A new major bus interchange constructed at the intersection of Epping Road and Longueville Road, as part of the Lane Cove tunnel works, opened in March 2008 with approximately 25 separate bus routes (including school routes) operating from here. This provides connections to north-west Sydney with services to Castle Hill and Rouse Hill operated by HillsBus, and publicly operated services to Chatswood, Epping, North Sydney, Macquarie Park/Centre, Gladesville and Drummoyne. City (QVB) Express services are extremely busy during morning peak. A cyclepath has been constructed along the southern edge of Epping Road from the Pacific Highway to the Lane Cove River. This cyclepath links to the Gore Hill Freeway Cyclepath. Connecting cyclepaths allow cyclists to journey to Chatswood, North Sydney, Willoughby and the Macquarie Park area. A ferry service that travels someway down the Lane Cove River, stops at Longueville Wharf and Greenwich Wharf. The closest train stations are about 3 kilometres away at Chatswood and Artarmon. It is not surprising that according to the 2001 census, only 4.1% of the population travelled to work by train alone. Other ways to travel include the train and bus (1.7%), walking or cycling (5.9%), the bus only (14.3%), and car (71.0%). Education, culture and religion Schools in Lane Cove are: * Currambena School - an independent primary and preschool. * Lane Cove Public School - a primary school, established in 1876, that educates around 800 students. * St Michael's School - a Catholic primary school, originally run by the Sisters of Mercy, who began teaching there in 1922. * Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview - a Jesuit high school for boys, founded in 1880. Cultural groups and services include the Lane Cove Youth Orchestra, Lane Cove Concert Band, Lane Cove Art Society, Lane Cove Dance Academy, Lane Cove Music and Cultural Centre, Lane Cove Historical Society, Lane Cove Theatre Company and Lane Cove Bushland and Conservation Society. Annual festivals are the Lane Cove Autumn Harmony Festival and the Cameraygal Festival. Places of worship in Lane Cove are: * St Michael's Catholic Church * St Andrew's Anglican Church * Lane Cove Uniting Church * The Christian City Church meets each Sunday at Lane Cove Public School. * Shinnyo- en Buddhist Temple Sports The Lane Cove Aquatic Leisure Centre provides excellent facilities and is situated adjacent to Pottery Green Oval, which is used for cricket in summer and soccer and baseball in winter. The Lane Cove Cricket Club and Lane Cove Rugby Club have their homeground at Tantallon Oval.http://www.covies.com/ The cricket club was established in 1893 and the Rugby Club in 1949. The Longueville Bowling Club, now known as the Longueville Sporting Club, has a lawn bowls green and is located close to the Lane Cove Country Club 9 hole golf course. Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview is an active participant in the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales, and has fielded cricket and rugby sides in this sporting competition for over a century. It also hosts the historic Riverview Gold Cup Regatta on the Lane Cove River. The rowing race day began in 1882. Lane Cove also has Junior sporting clubs. * Lane Cove Junior Rugby Union Club - U-5 to U-16 * Lane Cove Junior Rugby Club - Minis, U-10 to U-16 * Lane Cove Tigers Junior Rugby League Club * Lane Cove Cats AFL Club - Auskick, U-9 to U-11 * Lane Cove Football Club - U-6 to U-18 * Lane Cove Cricket Club - U=9 to Seniors Parks Woodford Bay, Lane Cove River Around 16% of the area is devoted to public recreational areas including Burns Bay Park, Tambourine Bay Park, Pottery Green, Blackman Park and Tantallon Oval. As well as this there is a large amount of bushland surrounding the river's edge especially near Riverview and Lane Cove West. Lane Cove also has many small creeks and rivers that flow through it and therefore has many expanses of bushland. The Lane Cove River is the largest river in the area. Lane Cove National Park is located close to the suburb. The Lane Cove Bushland Park is home to an endangered species of fungus, Hygrocybe lanecovensis, which is found nowhere else.NSW threatened species: Hygrocybe lanecovensis The species was discovered in the 1990s.

(born March 17, 1936) is a former American aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, Rear Admiral in the United States Navy and astronaut who flew on the Apollo 16, STS-4 and STS-51-C missions. Mattingly had been scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but three days prior to launch, he was held back and removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles (which he did not contract). He later flew as Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16 and made 64 lunar orbits,NASA Apollo 16 summary page making him one of 24 people to have flown to the Moon. Mattingly and his commander from Apollo 16, John Young, are the only people to have flown to the Moon and also a Space Shuttle orbital mission (Fred Haise, his former training crewmate from Apollo 13, did atmospheric flight testing of the Space Shuttle \\"Approach and Landing Tests\\"). During Apollo 16's return flight to Earth, Mattingly performed an extravehicular activity to retrieve film cassettes from the exterior of the spacecraft, the command and service module. It was the second \\"deep space\\" EVA in history, at great distance from any planetary body. As of , it remains one of only three such EVAs which have taken place, all during the Apollo program's J-missions. Early life and education Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II was born on March 17, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, to Thomas Kenneth Mattingly and Constance Mason () Mattingly. His father, who had been hired by Eastern Airlines soon after his son's birth, moved the family to Hialeah, Florida. Aviation became part of Mattingly's life from a very young age; he later recalled that his \\"earliest memories ... all had to do with airplanes.\\" Mattingly was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Miami Edison High School in 1954, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Auburn University in 1958. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity (Epsilon Alpha chapter). Retrieved February 19, 2012  Military career  He joined the U.S. Navy as an Ensign in 1958 and received his aviator wings in 1960. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron Thirty-five (VA-35) at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia and flew A-1H Skyraider aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier from 1960 to 1963. In July 1963, he served in Heavy Attack Squadron Eleven (VAH-11) at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, where he flew the A-3B Skywarrior aircraft for two years and deployed aboard . While based at Sanford, Mattingly's friend and fellow officer was assigned to a undertake aerial photo reconnaissance of a launch from Cape Canaveral and he convinced Mattingly to accompany him to on this mission and they ended up observing the launch of the Gemini 3 (carrying Mattingly's future Apollo 16 Commander John Young) from the air.https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm. After finishing his second cruise, Mattingly was frustrated in his attempt to join the US Navy Test pilot school at Patuxent River since the said cruise ended after the start of the class, however, he managed to obtain a place in the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Airforce Basehttps://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm where future astronauts Edgar Mitchell and Karol J. Bobko were his classmates and instructors included Charles Duke, his Apollo 16 crewmate and Henry Hartsfield who Mattingly would command on STS 4. He has logged 7,200 hours of flight time‚Äîwhich includes 5,000 hours in jet aircraft. NASA career Mattingly (center) as part of the original prime crew for Apollo 13 =Selection and training= On September 10, 1965, NASA began the selection process for the fifth astronaut group. From a pool of 351 applicants, NASA selected 159 candidates that met the basic qualifications that required that applicants must be United States citizens born on or after December 1, 1929, and no more than six feet tall. They were also required to have at least 1,000 hours of flight time in a jet aircraft. Mattingly had previously shown little interest and inclination to apply for the astronaut program, however, his views changed when at the Air Force Test pilot school and his class was offered the chance to apply for either NASA or the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory program. Mattingly and Mitchell chose the later snd were rejected. The deadline for applying for the NASA group had passed however one of their instructors was able to get NASA to accept their application regardlesshttps://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm. On the interview panel the astronaut office representatives were John Young and Michael Collins, at that time in training as prime crew for Gemini 10. Mattingly would later recollect that he was \\"perplexed\\" by Young. Collins asked Mattingly what he felt about the F-104, to which Mattingly replied that he thought it was a \\"fun aircraft\\" but without worth in combat, Collins appeared to dislike the answer and Mattingly felt he had blown his chance. However, after the conclusion of the selection process, Mattingly was called by Deke Slayton with an offer to become an astronaut.https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/MattinglyTK/MattinglyTK_11-6-01.htm At the time of his selection, had 2,582 hours of flight experience, including 1,036 hours in a jet aircraft. He also had a bachelor's degree in engineering or in the physical or biological sciences as required by the initial qualifications. From the 100 military personnel and 59 civilian candidates, NASA selected 19 astronauts to join the group. Mattingly, a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, was a student at the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, when NASA selected him as an astronaut in April 1966. =Apollo 8 and Apollo 11= Mattingly poses at the launch pad At first, Mattingly was part of the support crew for Apollo 8. Mattingly served as CAPCOM during Apollo 8's second television transmission and subsequent preparation for trans-Earth injection. He then trained parallel with Bill Anders for Apollo 11 as backup Command Module Pilot, because Anders was going to retire from NASA in August 1969, and in case of mission delay, Anders would be unavailable. =Apollo 13= Mattingly's first prime assignment was to be the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission. Three days prior to launch, he was removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles (which he never contracted) and was replaced by the backup CM pilot, Jack Swigert. As a result, he missed the dramatic in-flight explosion that crippled the spacecraft. However, Mattingly was involved in helping the crew solve the problem of power conservation during re-entry. =Apollo 16= Mattingly performs a deep-space EVA during Apollo 16 The swapout from Apollo 13 placed Mattingly on the crew that would fly Apollo 16 (April 16‚Äì27, 1972), the fifth crewed lunar landing mission. The crew included John W. Young (Commander), Mattingly (Command Module Pilot), and Charles M. Duke Jr. (Lunar Module Pilot). The mission assigned to Apollo 16 was to collect samples from the lunar highlands near the crater Descartes. While in lunar orbit the scientific instruments aboard the Command/Service Module Casper extended the photographic and geochemical mapping of a belt around the lunar equator. Twenty-six separate scientific experiments were conducted both in lunar orbit and during cislunar coast. Major emphasis was placed on using man as an orbital observer, capitalizing on the human eye's unique capabilities and man's inherent curiosity. During the return leg of the mission, Mattingly carried out an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film and data packages from the science bay on the side of the service module. Although the mission of Apollo 16 was terminated one day early, due to concern over several spacecraft malfunctions, all major objectives were accomplished through the ceaseless efforts of the mission support team and were made possible by the most rigorous preflight planning yet associated with an Apollo mission. =Space Shuttle flights= Following his return to Earth, Mattingly served in astronaut managerial positions in the Space Shuttle development program. Mattingly (foreground) with Henry Hartsfield salutes President Ronald Reagan, next to First Lady Nancy Reagan, after the STS-4 landing on July 4, 1982 \\"President Ronald Reagan chats with NASA astronauts Henry Hartsfield and Thomas Mattingly on the runway as first lady Nancy Reagan scans the nose of Space Shuttle Columbia following its Independence Day landing at Edwards Air Force Base on July 4, 1982.\\" Mattingly was named to command STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 27, 1982, with Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., as the pilot. This 7-day mission was designed to further verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; perform continued studies of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the orbiter subsystems; and conduct a survey of orbiter-induced contamination on the orbiter payload bay. Additionally, the crew operated several scientific experiments located in the orbiter's cabin and in the payload bay. These experiments included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System experiment designed to investigate the separation of biological materials in a fluid according to their surface electrical charge. This experiment was a pathfinder for the first commercial venture to capitalize on the unique characteristics of space. The crew is also credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled them to activate the first operational \\"Getaway Special\\" (composed of nine experiments that ranged from algae and duckweed growth in space to fruit fly and brine shrimp genetic studies). STS-4 completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on July 4, 1982. Mattingly and Hartsfield were greeted by President Ronald Reagan after the landing; Reagan recognized the pair, both graduates of Auburn University, as \\"you two sons of Auburn\\" in his welcoming speech. STS-51-C, the first Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 24, 1985. The crew included Ken Mattingly (spacecraft commander), Loren Shriver (pilot), James Buchli and Ellison Onizuka (Mission Specialists), and Gary Payton (DOD Payload Specialist). STS-51-C performed its DOD mission which included deployment of a modified Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) vehicle from the Space Shuttle Discovery. Landing occurred on January 27, 1985. Post-NASA career In 1985, Mattingly retired from NASA and retired from the Navy in 1986 with the two-star rank of Rear admiral (upper half), and entered the private sector. He worked as a Director in Grumman's Space Station Support Division. He then headed the Atlas booster program for General Dynamics in San Diego, California. At Lockheed Martin he was Vice President in charge of the X-33 development program. He is currently working at Systems Planning and Analysis in Virginia. Mattingly is a member of many organizations. He is an associate fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; fellow, American Astronautical Society; and member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and the U.S. Naval Institute. Awards and honors Mattingly is a recipient of numerous awards. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medals (2); Johnson Space Center Certificate of Commendation (1970); JSC Group Achievement Award (1972); Navy Distinguished Service Medal; Navy Astronaut Wings; SETP Ivan C. Kincheloe Award (1972); Delta Tau Delta Achievement Award (1972); Auburn Alumni Engineers Council Outstanding Achievement Award (1972); AAS Flight Achievement Award for 1972; AIAA Haley Astronautics Award for 1973; F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale awarded him the V. M. Komarov Diploma in 1973; Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal (1982). Mattingly was inducted with a group of Apollo astronauts into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. Personal life In 1970, he married Elizabeth Dailey. They have one child. In media Mattingly was portrayed in the 1995 movie Apollo 13 by fellow Chicagoan Gary Sinise. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon by ≈Ωeljko Ivanek.

He also developed a method for the analysis of nitrogen in compounds.  Biography  Dumas was born in Al√®s (Gard), and became an apprentice to an apothecary in his native town. In 1816, he moved to Geneva, where he attended lectures by M. A. Pictet in physics, C. G. de la Rive in chemistry, and A. P. de Candolle in botany, and before he had reached his majority, he was engaged with Pierre Pr√©vost in original work on problems of physiological chemistry and even of embryology. In 1822, he moved to Paris, acting on the advice of Alexander von Humboldt, where he became professor of chemistry, initially at the Lyceum, later (1835) at the √âcole polytechnique. He was one of the founders of the √âcole centrale des arts et manufactures (later named √âcole centrale Paris) in 1829. In 1832 Dumas became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. From 1868 until his death in 1884 he would serve the academy as the permanent secretary for its department of Physical Sciences. In 1838, Dumas was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The same year he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands and, when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member. Dumas was president of Soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale from 1845 to 1864. After 1848, he exchanged much of his scientific work for ministerial posts under Napol√©on III. He became a member of the National Legislative Assembly. He acted as minister of agriculture and commerce for a few months in 1850‚Äì1851, and subsequently became a senator, president of the municipal council of Paris, and master of the French mint, but his official career came to a sudden end with the fall of the Second Empire. Jean-Baptiste Dumas Dumas was a devout Catholic who would often defend Christian views against critics. Dumas died at Cannes in 1884, and is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, in a large tomb near the back wall. His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower.  Scientific work  Grave of Dumas (Paris) Dumas was one of the first to criticise the electro-chemical doctrines of J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, which, at the time his work began, were widely accepted as the true theory of the constitution of compound bodies, and opposed a unitary view to the dualistic conception of the Swedish chemist. In a paper on the atomic theory, published in 1826, he anticipated to a remarkable extent some ideas which are frequently supposed to belong to a later period; and the continuation of these studies led him to the ideas about substitution (metalepsis) which were developed about 1839 into the theory (Older Style Theory) that in organic chemistry there are certain types which remain unchanged even when their hydrogen is replaced by an equivalent quantity of a halide element. The classification of organic compounds into homologous series was advanced as one consequence of his researches into the acids generated by the oxidation of the alcohols. Dumas also showed that kidneys remove urea from the blood. Vapour densities and atomic masses Dumas perfected the method of measuring vapor densities which was also important in determining atomic weights (see below). A known amount of the substance being analyzed was put into a previously weighed glass bulb, which was then sealed and heated in water to vaporize the substance. The pressure was recorded with a barometer, and the bulb is allowed to cool to determine the mass of the vapor. The universal gas law was then used to determine the moles of gas within the bulb. In an 1826 paper, he described his method for ascertaining vapour densities, and the redeterminations which he undertook by its aid of the atomic weights of carbon and oxygen proved the forerunners of a long series which included some thirty of the elements, the results being mostly published in 1858‚Äì1860. He showed \\"in all elastic fluids observed under the same conditions, the molecules are placed at equal distances\\". He also determined the atomic weight of titanium, one of the rare earth elements. Dumas established new values for the atomic mass of thirty elements, setting the value for hydrogen to 1. Determination of nitrogen In 1833, Dumas developed a method for estimating the amount of nitrogen in an organic compound, founding modern analysis methods. He made important revisions to the existing combustion methods with a sophisticated pneumatic trough. These revisions were the flushing of the combustion tube with carbon dioxide and the addition of potassium hydroxide in the pneumatic trough. Flushing with carbon dioxide eliminated the nitrogen present in the air that previously occupied the combustion tube, eliminating the need for correction due to nitrogen in the air. The potassium hydroxide dissolved the passing carbon dioxide gas, which left nitrogen as the only gas in the collection tube. Theory of substitution and theory of chemical types At the Tuileries palace in Paris, guests of a soiree began reacting adversely to a gas suddenly emitted by the candles. Alexandre Brongniart asked his son-in- law, Dumas, to investigate. Dumas found that the coughing and dangerous fumes were caused by chlorine present in the candle wax. Chlorine had been used to whiten the candles, and Dumas concluded that it must have combined during the candle-making process. This led Dumas to investigate the behavior of chlorine substitution in other chemical compounds. One of the most important research projects of Dumas was that on the action of chlorine on acetic acid to form trichloroacetic acid ‚Äì a derivative of essentially the same character as the acetic acid itself. Dumas extended this to a theory (sometimes considered a law) which states that in an organic compound, a hydrogen atom may be substituted for any halogen. In his published paper on the subject, Dumas introduces his theory of types. Since the trichloracetic acid retained similar properties to acetic acid, Dumas reasoned that there were certain chemical structures that remained comparatively unchanged even if one atom were changed within them. The basis of this theory rests in the natural history of organism classification, which Dumas learned under the botanist de Candolle. This new theory challenged Berzelius's previous theory of electrochemical dualism and was also a competitor of radical theory. Family He married Herminie Brongniart, daughter of Alexandre Brongniart, in 1826.

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line and T9 Northern line services. Situated at St Johns Avenue, Gordon in the Ku-ring-gai Council local government area of New South Wales, Australia, the station was designed and built by the New South Wales Department of Railways in 1909. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History In 1887, tenders were called for construction of a branch line extending south from Hornsby to the North Shore. The section between Hornsby and St. Leonards was opened on 1 January 1890. Stations provided at the opening of the line included Chatswood and St Leonards. A single line was constructed at the time. The line between St Leonards and Milson's Point (the terminus at the edge of the harbour) was completed 1 May 1893. Gordon Railway Station was opened on 1 January 1890. In 1909 the single line was duplicated between Hornsby and St. Leonard's. At Gordon, during the duplication the original single platform and station building were replaced by a new island platform with a standard brick island- platform style station building. The island platform served the Up North Shore line and the Down North Shore line. A third platform was built at Gordon (the Local Platform) adjacent to the Up line. This platform allowed for termination of local trains at Gordon. At the time of duplication, an overhead footbridge and booking office was built which allowed local residents to cross from one side of Gordon to the other and allowed access to the platforms via sets of steps. A goods siding (adjacent to the Down line), crossovers and a signal box on the platform (part of the station building) completed the track arrangement. Originally southbound services used Platform 1 with Platform 2 a terminal road with a buffer stop at the northern end. In the early 1990s, the station was reconfigured with Platform 2 becoming the main southbound platform and Platform 1 the terminal road. Since the 1990s, a number of car parks have been built. In 2014, the bus stop on the station's western side was demolished to make way for a three-storey carpark and bus interchange.Gordon Commuter Carparks & Interchange Transport for NSW The new interchange opened in early June 2015. Platforms and services  Description  =Buildings and structures= The buildings comprise a station building, including a signal box, and platforms 2/3, completed ; an overhead booking office, completed ; and station building and platform 1, completed in 1993. Other structures include a footbridge, completed in 1909; platforms, completed in 1909; and modern steel shelters. =Context= Gordon Railway Station is located east of the Pacific Highway at Gordon. The station includes three platforms; an early 20th century overhead walkway and booking office with modern lift towers on the northern side; an early 20th century station building on an island platform; a reconstructed late 19th century timber waiting room; and an easement approximately 10m wide on either side of the railway tracks, which has been landscaped. The station is accessed via modern stairs and disabled ramp from either side of the station. There is a commercial strip on the western side of the Pacific Highway immediately across the road from the station. =Station building ()= Exterior: Located on the island platform (Platform 2/3) the station building is a good representative example of the standard railway design A8-A10 station buildings along the Northern line. Walls are red face brick, tuck pointed with moulded rendered string course, architraves and window sills. The gabled roof is modern corrugated steel, and the ends are timber boarded. The lower pitched awnings over the platform are supported on cast iron awning brackets springing from moulded rendered corbels. One face brick chimney with rendered top is sited along the ridge line. At the northern end of the building is located a brick signal box with encircling sliding 6-paned windows on three sides under the main roof line. The exterior of the station is largely in original condition, with no additional openings or infilled elements. Interior: The interior of the Platform 2/3 station building contains a high degree of original fabric and layout. Original internal details include mini-orb ceiling, ceiling roses, plastered wall finishes with moulded dado, and door and window joinery including 16-paned coloured glass sashes. The floor has been replaced with concrete, and modern fluorescent lighting installed. The interior of the signal box is painted brick to window sill height and timber boarded above the windows, with a mini orb ceiling and timber floor. Fittings include the 28 lever frame, key box, 1927 Indicator board, 1969 indicator board, original timber desk and bells. =Overhead booking office= Exterior: The timber framed and weatherboard clad booking office was constructed in 1910 and located on the overhead platform. It has a gabled roof of modern corrugated iron steel with finials. The roof overhang and projecting gable on the southern side provides a sheltered area for ticket purchasing, and features timber boarded ceiling and rose. Two modern ticket windows have been inserted into original openings with decorative timber architraves remaining. Other modern ticket machines have been recessed into the building in new openings with profiled timber architraves. Two new steel and glass lifts are located on the north side of the building and overbridge. New access structures to these lifts have been constructed in a similar style and material to the original booking office, and feature coloured glass panels. The lift access structure on the eastern side includes two small commercial tenancies, only one of which is presently occupied. Interior: Internally the original layout of the building appears to have been largely altered. Timber panelled wall linings appear original, although the battened plaster ceiling is not. Air- conditioning ducts and fluorescent lights are modern. Doors are timber panelled and windows are 4 or 6-paned sash, which all appear to be original. =Station building (1993)= A small timber framed structure reconstructed in 1993 based on the design of the original 1890 waiting room. The structure is clad externally with timber weatherboards and has a skillion roof of corrugated steel. The structure is open with exposed framing, concrete floor and timber bench. =Footbridge= Dating from 1909 the footbridge has a steel haunched beam construction supported on steel trestles. The two bay structure spans two tracks on the eastern side and one track on the western side of the rail corridor. Markings of imported British steel manufacturers are visible, both Lanarkshire, and Dorman Long & Co., Middlesbrough. The concourse has a concrete deck and modern steel balustrades. Modern concrete steps on steel supports provide access to the island platform. Similar steps and disabled ramp provide access to the streets on either side of the station. =Platforms= The island platform (Platform 2/3) at Gordon was built in 1909 as part of the line duplication for the Northern line, and has brick faces and an asphalt platform surface. The overhead booking office and footbridge are located approximately at the halfway point of the platform, with the station building located at the southern end. Platform 1 also has brick faces and an asphalt surface and is likely to date from the same period. =Modern steel structures= As part of the upgrading of the station in which lifts were installed, steel framed shelters were installed at the northern end of both platforms. =Landscape= Both the eastern and western lengths of the rail corridor are landscaped with several mature trees and shrubs including poplars, jasmine, jacaranda, palms, agapanthus, camellias and lawned areas. =Moveable items= *1914‚Äì1918 Honour Roll (overhead platform) *1927 and 1969 timber indicator boards still in use (overhead platform) *Cast iron drinking fountain (Platform 2/3) = Condition = As at 26 October 2010, the overhead Booking Office was in good condition. Also in good condition were the two station buildings (Platform 2/3) and (Platform 1), the footbridge, the platforms, and the landscape. The modern steel shelters were assessed as being in very good condition. The archaeological potential is considered low. The station group retains a high level of integrity, with sympathetic modern additions. = Modifications and dates = *1927: Electrification of the North Shore line between Milson's Point and Hornsby was opened on 15 August 1927. *1928: Full electric services were provided 15 July 1928, and included services at Gordon. With electrification came automatic signalling and most signal boxes were closed. However, Gordon Signal Box remained in service until recent years (as with other North Shore signal boxes including North Sydney, Chatswood, Lindfield) due to the need for local control of terminating trains. When the principal signal control centres were opened at Sydney and Hornsby, these local signal boxes were closed, including Gordon. With electrification of the North Shore line, a relatively small 1500 V DC substation was built adjacent to the down North Shore line at Gordon. *1990s: The former Gordon substation was replaced by a modern DC substation on the opposite side of the line and the original substation building (brick) was demolished. *N.d: Some relatively modern additions such as shelters / awnings have been provided on the island platform. Transport links Forest Coach Lines operates three routes to and from Gordon station: *195: to St Ives Chase Loop service *196: to Mona Vale *197: to Mona Vale & Macquarie University Transdev NSW operates three routes to and from Gordon station: *560: to West Pymble Loop Service *562: to Macquarie University *582: to St Ives Gordon is served by one NightRide route: *N90: Hornsby station to City (Town Hall)  Heritage listing  As at 26 October 2010, Gordon Railway Station Group is significant at a state level as an excellent representative example of an early 20th century suburban station building group located on the North Shore line, which retains a high degree of integrity and quality in its architectural detail. The station group demonstrates the importance of the role of the railway in opening up the areas of the northern suburbs of Sydney for settlement at this time. It is able to evoke an earlier era of rail travel through its grouping of the original Platform 2/3 station building, platforms and booking office, along with sympathetic later additions. The station contributes to the cohesive character of the North Shore line, characterised by its early 20th century railway architecture, generally in landscaped settings, which demonstrates the rapid construction of this section of the rail network. Gordon station stands out in the North Shore group of stations, due to its overhead booking office, which is an unusual feature in this region. Gordon railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Gordon Railway Station is historically significant at a state level. Opened in 1890, Gordon Station was one of the first stations along the North Shore line, and demonstrates the role of the railway in facilitating the rapid subdivision and development of the northern suburbs of Sydney. The elements that contribute to this significance include the 1909-1910 station building, booking office, overhead walkway, and platforms. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. As a complex, Gordon Railway Station is of state aesthetic significance as a fine example of an early 20th Century railway station along the North Shore line, which retains a high degree of integrity and quality of detail. The elaborate nature of its architectural detail is perhaps indicative of the importance of Gordon Railway Station as an early intermediate terminus along the North Shore line. This station building contributes to the cohesive group of 20th century railway architecture which is characteristic of the northern section of the rail network, and demonstrates the rapid historical construction of the North Shore line. The reconstructed waiting room contributes to the general early 20th century character of the Gordon Railway Station, and is a physical record of one the earliest structures at the station, although in itself it has little heritage value. The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Gordon Railway Station has social significance as evidenced by the community involvement during the design and construction of the new lifts and access arrangements. Local historical societies are also known to include the station complex in historical tours of the local area, thereby demonstrating the high esteem held by particular members of the community for the Gordon Railway Station. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The location of the booking office on the overbridge is rare along the North Shore line, which is perhaps indicative of the importance of Gordon Railway Station as an early terminus along this line. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Gordon Railway Station is of representative significance at a state level as an early 20th century railway station complex. Elements that contribute to this significance include the 1909 station building, overbridge and platforms. The footbridge is a good representative example of such structures, of which 28 were constructed in Metropolitan Sydney, with a number still remain within the metro network. The brick station building on the island platform is a good and intact representative example of early 20th century station building constructed along the North Shore line.

A drawing of John Thwaites in 1858. Background Thwaites was a native of Maulds Meaburn, Westmorland where his father was a farmer. He attended Reagill School. As the third son he was not expected to follow in his father's stead, and went to London in 1832 to work for Henry Bardwell, a woollen draper on Holborn Hill; in 1835, he became a partner in the business, which had a base on Oxford Street. In 1842, he left to establish his own company at 18 Blackman Street in The Borough; it later moved to 61-2 Borough High Street. Municipal work His religion led Thwaites into municipal affairs. He was a Strict Baptist and preached at several locations including the Surrey Tabernacle (where he was Deacon for sixteen years), St Mary's Newington Butts, St Paul's Deptford and St Saviour; this led to opportunities to be a churchwarden and Guardian of the Poor. He became known for his work with the local community and was Chairman of the Guardians. Thwaites also acted to support local business: when he discovered there was a monopoly on the supply of gas in Southwark, Thwaites set up the Surrey Gas Consumers company in 1849, a mutual association of businesses, to get alternative and much cheaper supplies. He was made a member of more than one Vestry, which handled local government for the parish, and was also delegated to the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers from Southwark. He knew the problem of sewerage (the most pressing problem in London) well enough to write a well-received and knowledgeable pamphlet about it. Politically, Thwaites supported Parliamentary Reform and the Liberal Party, especially Apsley Pellatt who was Liberal MP for Southwark. He also supported the early closing movement which campaigned to allow shopworkers more time off work. On the MBW In 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works was established to co-ordinate work throughout London, to be composed of delegates from the Vestries. Thwaites was selected by two different Vestries to be their delegate, and his involvement across London and on the Commission of Sewers led to his election by the Board to be their Chairman on 22 December 1855. Thwaites therefore became responsible for the wholescale construction of a sewerage system, as well as street works and other infrastructure. He was fortunate in obtaining the services of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, formerly Deputy Chief Engineer to the Commission of Sewers, as the Board's Chief Engineer. Thwaites persuaded the Government to give responsibility for the construction of the Victoria Embankment, which was part of the new drainage, to the Metropolitan Board. A Royal Commission had recommended a special body of commissioners take responsibility. The embankment was held up by delays in the construction of the Metropolitan District Railway, and eventually Thwaites went ahead without it; the railway was put in later. Honours and death When the main drainage was complete in 1865, Thwaites was knighted. The Victoria Embankment was finally completed and opened in July 1870, a few weeks before Thwaites' death. His illness was caused partly by overwork which contributed to his problems from diabetes, but ironically, in view of his work on building London's sewerage system, Thwaites died of cholera at his Wandsworth home. He was followed in the job of chairman by James Macnaghten Hogg MP. As a Leader, Thwaites was respected but regarded as somewhat formal. He was nicknamed The Stiff'un by the Board's staff. He tried to keep involved in all aspects of the Board and insisted that those who were too infirm or too old should retire. He was described as having \\"a stony gaze and a sepulchral voice\\".

History and naming of the island The name \\"Orcas\\" is a shortened form of Horcasitas, or Juan Vicente de G√ºemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the Viceroy of Mexico who sent an exploration expedition under Francisco de Eliza to the Pacific Northwest in 1791. During the voyage, Eliza explored part of the San Juan Islands. He did not apply the name Orcas specifically to Orcas Island, but rather to part of the archipelago. In 1847, Henry Kellett assigned the name Orcas to Orcas Island during his reorganization of the British Admiralty charts. Kellett's work eliminated the patriotically American names that Charles Wilkes had given to many features of the San Juans during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838‚Äì1842. Wilkes had named Orcas Island \\"Hull Island\\", after Commodore Isaac Hull. Other features of Orcas Island named by Wilkes include \\"Ironsides Inlet\\" for East Sound and \\"Guerrier Bay\\" for West Sound. One of the names Wilkes gave remains: Mount Constitution. Wilkes' names follow a pattern: Isaac Hull was the commander of \\"Old Ironsides\\" (the ') and won fame after capturing the British warship Guerriere in the War of 1812. The islands were first claimed by Spain, then by Britain, who agreed that all below the 49th parallel was part of the US, in the treaty signed after the War of 1812. The Oregon territory, which then included Washington state and this island, was used jointly by the US and Britain until 1848, but border disputes specifically concerning the San Juan Islands, including the Pig War (1859), were not settled until 1871. The similarity to the name of the orca, which is popularly associated with coastal Washington state, is coincidental. Geography With a land area of 57.3 square miles (148.4 km¬≤) and a population of 5,387 (2010 census), Orcas Island is slightly larger, but less populous, than neighboring San Juan Island. Orcas is shaped like a pair of saddlebags, separated by fjord-like Eastsound, and 2 prominent bays, Westsound and Deer Harbor, on the southwest side. At the northern end of the island is the village of Eastsound, the largest population center on Orcas and the second largest in San Juan County. Other, smaller hamlets on the island include Orcas Landing (where the inter-island/mainland ferry lands), West Sound (with Eastsound addresses), Deer Harbor, Rosario (with Eastsound addresses), Olga and Doe Bay. There are a number of former settlements that no longer exist, which were mostly built up around the lime kiln and fruit growing industries. Island access The state supports island access through the Washington State Ferries system. In addition, the island can be accessed through a variety of air, seaplane and sea charter services. Private watercraft can use public docks located near the villages around the island, and various public shoreline access points. During the summer season, there is an island shuttle van that runs from the ferry landing to Eastsound and other points. Museums * The Orcas Island Historical Museum is located down town Eastsound and is the only object-based, interpretive heritage facility for the island, with a permanent collection containing approximately 6000 objects, paper documents and photographs. *Crow Valley School Museum is a one-room school house built in 1888, open by appoint only. * Orcas Island is also home to three historic camps: Camp Orkila, Four Winds Westward Ho and Camp Indralaya. Public services The Orcas Island School District operates three schools on a single campus: Orcas Island Elementary School housed in the island's historic Nellie S. Milton school building; Orcas Island Middle School; and Orcas Island High School. All of the island's public schools are located in Eastsound. The Orcas Island Public Library is located in Eastsound and serves a population of approximately 6,000 card holders. The Orcas Island Library District is a junior-taxing district that funds the Orcas Island Public Library's operating budget through property taxes. The annual Library Fair sells books donated by Orcas Island residents and visitors, the proceeds of which are donated back to the Library's operating budget. In 2018 Orcas Island Voters approved the creation of San Juan County Public Hospital District #3 (OIHCD) and later elected five Commissioners to the board. OIHCD funds local health care services ensuring care services to locals.  Parks  =Village Green= The Village Green is located in the center of Eastsound village.

The United States obtained Shaw Island and the rest of the San Juan archipelago by treaty in 1855, but Lummi retained certain cultural and resource rights, including fishing. The Wilkes Expedition, in 1841, named the island after John Shaw, a United States Naval Officer. According to Bill Tsilixw James, hereditary chief of the Lummi Nation, the Lummi know the island as Sq'emenen. A San Juan Island resident proposed to the state Board of Geographic Names in 2015 that Squaw Bay be renamed Sq'emenen Bay; that proposal generated a compromise proposal from the Shaw Island Historical Society to rename the bay Reef Net Bay, in recognition of the reef net fishing historically and currently done there.

Tourism Businesses pertaining to tourism are required to maintain the character of the island as a small-scale, rural, and agricultural community through the Shaw Subarea Plan of Washington State's Growth Management Act. These include commercial recreational facilities; transient accommodations by themselves or in combination with any commercial use, food service facilities, and transient moorage and dry storage facilities. Nuns There have been three Catholic religious institutes of nuns on Shaw Island. Benedictine nuns established a monastery on in the 1970s; while the Sisters of Mercy have owned an unofficial retreat on the island since the 1980s. Nuns of the Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist ran the island's only store and the ferry terminal for almost 3 decades, until 2004, relocating elsewhere . Historical structures Shaw Island School District #10, has an operational historic one-room school (although a second room was later added), with classes for kindergarten through eighth grade students.

This area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to Middle Harbour and north to the entrance of Broken Bay. The area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country. The Northern Beaches district is governed on a local level by the Northern Beaches Council, which was formed in May 2016 from Warringah Council (est. 1906), Manly Council (est. 1877), and Pittwater Council (est. 1992). History =Early history= Barrenjoey Head Lighthouse, Palm Beach, New South Wales, Australia The traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the land now known as the Northern Beaches were the Kuringgai people of the Eora nation. Within a few years of European settlement, the Kuringgai had mostly disappeared from this area mainly due to an outbreak of smallpox in 1789. Much evidence of their habitation remains especially their rock etchings in Kuring-gai Chase National Park which borders northern beaches's north-western side. The northern beaches region was explored early on in the settlement of Sydney, only a few weeks after the arrival of the First Fleet. However, it remained a rural area for most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, with only small settlements in the valleys between headlands. While it was geographically close to the city centre, to reach the area over land from Sydney via Mona Vale Road was a trip of more than . Since those days, urban growth proceeded slowly until the 1960s when development accelerated because of improved roads and a general increase in living standards in the regions.https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/historic-buildings- places/barrenjoey-lighthouse In 1906, the Warringah Shire council was formed the NSW Government Gazette, along with 132 other new Shires within New South Wales. It ran roughly from Broken Bay in the north to Manly Lagoon to the south, and by Middle Harbour Creek and Cowan Creek in the west. Pittwater was incooperated as the \\"A Riding\\" of Warringah Shire, however for many years there existed a sentiment held by some in A Riding, the northern Riding and the largest in Warringah, taking up more than 40% of Warringah's land area, that they were being increasingly ignored and subject to what they considered inappropriate development and policies for their area. http://www.pittwater.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/pittwater_secession This culminated in 1991 when a non-compulsory postal poll of the residents of A Riding was taken over the question of a possible secession. This resulted in a 73.5% vote in favour of secession, however only 48.18% of residents took part in this vote. This vote was, however, 600 short of the total majority required. Over time, the Northern Beaches was often divided by the \\"Lower Northern Beaches\\", referring to the southern end of the region, and the \\"Upper Northern Beaches\\", referring to the northern end of the region (North Narrabeen to Palm Beach). In 2016, the Local Government (Council Amalgamations) Proclamation 2016 insisted that the Northern Beaches region councils of Manly, Warringah and Pittwater become the Northern Beaches Council. This was effective from the 12th of May 2016.https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/regulations/2016-242.pdf Today, the Northern Beaches is very well part of the Sydney metropolis, however maintains an isolated environment from the other regions of Sydney including the neighboring North Shore region.

Over the 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth, tectonic upheavals and colliding plates have raised great mountain ranges while the forces of erosion and weathering worked to tear them down. Even after many millions of years, records of Earth's great upheavals remain imprinted as textural variations and surface patterns that define distinctive landscapes or provinces. The diversity of the landscapes of the United States can be easily seen on the shaded relief image to the right. The stark contrast between the ‚Äòrough' texture of the western US and the ‚Äòsmooth' central and eastern regions is immediately apparent. Differences in roughness (topographic relief) result from a variety of processes acting on the underlying rock. The plate tectonic history of a region strongly influences the rock type and structure exposed at the surface, but differing rates of erosion that accompany changing climates can also have profound impacts on the land. There are twelve main geological provinces in the United States: Pacific, Columbia Plateau, Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, Rocky Mountains, Laurentian Upland, Interior Plains, Interior Highlands, Appalachian Highlands, Atlantic Plain, Alaskan, and Hawaiian. Each province has its own geologic history and unique features. This article will describe each province in turn. Pacific Province This region is one of the most geologically young and tectonically active in North America. The generally rugged, mountainous landscape of this province provides evidence of ongoing mountain-building. The Pacific Province straddles the boundaries between several of Earth's moving plates:the source of the monumental forces required to build the sweeping arc of mountains that extends from Alaska to the southern reaches of South America. This province includes the active and sometimes deadly volcanoes of the Cascade Range and the young, steep mountains of the Pacific Border and the Sierra Nevada. =Sierra Nevada= deep underground. Although the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range form a nearly continuous barrier along the western edge of the United States, the two ranges really have very little in common. They have been and continue to be formed by quite different geological forces and processes. The rocks that form the backbone of the Sierra Nevada are mostly granitic rocks that formed during the Mesozoic Era, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. At that time, an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes, similar to the present-day Cascade volcanic arc, erupted where the Sierra Nevada now stands. Rising through older Paleozoic rock, molten rock erupted at the surface as lava, but most solidified deep within the earth, forming the gray granitic rocks familiar to any Sierra traveler. Although from a distance the Sierran rock looks quite similar, it is actually made up of many individual rock bodies that formed from repeated intrusions of magma over many millions of years. Even as they grew, erosion was wearing away these Mesozoic Era volcanoes. By Late Cretaceous time, about 70 million years ago, the once-deep granitic rocks began to be exposed at the Earth's surface. By a few tens of millions of years ago, so much of the upper part had worn away that the surface of the ancient range had a low relief of just a few thousand feet. It wasn't until quite recently, geologically-speaking, that the Sierra Nevada range as we know it today began to grow. During the Miocene Epoch, less than 20 million years ago, the continental crust east of the Sierra Nevada began to stretch in an east‚Äìwest direction. The crust broke into a series of north‚Äìsouth-trending valleys and mountain ranges: the beginning of the Basin and Range province. The height of the Sierra Nevada is caused by a fault on the eastern side of the mountains. Less than five million years ago, the range that we now know as the Sierra Nevada began to rise along its eastern margin. Through a combination of uplift of the Sierran block and down-dropping of the area to the east, the Sierra rose upward. Rising far more steeply to the east than the west, the entire Sierra Nevada can be thought of as an enormous tilted fault block with a long, gentle slope westward to California's Central Valley and steep eastern slope. Not long after the Sierra uplift began, the Earth cooled, marking the beginning of the Pleistocene (Ice Age) Epoch. Glaciers grew in the Sierra highlands and made their way down former stream channels, carving U-shaped valleys. The sheer walls and hanging valleys of Yosemite National Park are a product of this chilly past. =Cascades Volcanic Province= Where the Sierra Nevada ends a chain of explosive volcanic centers, the Cascade volcanoes, begins. The Cascades Province forms an arc-shaped band extending from British Columbia to Northern California, roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline. Within this region, 13 major volcanic centers lie in sequence like a string of explosive pearls. Although the largest volcanoes like Mount St. Helens get the most attention, the Cascades is really made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes that dominate the landscape. The Cascades volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. As if volcanic hazards were not enough, the Ring of Fire is also infamous for its frequent earthquakes. In order to understand the origins of this concentrated band of Earth hazards, we have to slice deep into the Earth. The Cascade Range is formed by an active continental margin A slice of the Earth from the Pacific Ocean through the Pacific Northwest might look something like the adjacent image. Beneath the Cascades, a dense oceanic plate plunges beneath the North American Plate; a process known as subduction. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Range) above the subduction zone. Geological map of the Cascade Range. Yellow indicates earthquakes, black lines indicate faults A close-up look at the Cascades reveals a more complicated picture than the simple subduction zone shown in the image on theleft. Not far off the coast of the North Pacific lies a spreading ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where new ocean crust is created. On one side of the spreading ridge new Pacific Plate crust is made, then moves away from the ridge. On the other side of the spreading ridge the Juan de Fuca Plate and Gorda Plate move eastward. There are some unusual features at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca Plate sinks beneath the North American Plate there is no deep trench, seismicity (earthquakes) are fewer than expected, and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American Plates. These two plates converge at 3‚Äì4 centimeters per year at present. This is only about half the rate of convergence of 7 million years ago. The small Juan de Fuca Plate and two platelets, the Explorer Plate and Gorda Plate are the meager remnants of the much larger Farallon oceanic plate. The Explorer Plate broke away from the Juan de Fuca about 4 million years ago and shows no evidence that it is still being subducted. The Gorda platelet split away between 18 and 5 million years ago and continues to sink beneath North America. The Cascade Range made its first appearance 36 million years ago, but the major peaks that rise up from today's volcanic centers were born within the last 1.6 million years (during the Pleistocene). More than 3000 vents erupted during the most recent volcanic episode that began 5 million years ago. As long as subduction continues, new Cascade volcanoes will continue to rise. Columbia Plateau The Columbia Plateau covers part of three states The Columbia Plateau province is enveloped by one of the world's largest accumulations of lava. Over of the Earth's surface is covered by it. The topography here is dominated by geologically young lava flows that inundated the countryside with amazing speed, all within the last 17 million years. Over of basaltic lava, known as the Columbia River basalts, covers the western part of the province. These tremendous flows erupted between 17 million years ago. Most of the lava flooded out in the first 1.5 million years: an extraordinarily short time for such an outpouring of molten rock. A map of the Snake River Plain, showing its smooth topography The Snake River Plain stretches across Oregon, through northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and ends at the Yellowstone Plateau in Wyoming. Looking like a great spoon scooped out the Earth surface, the smooth topography of this province forms a striking contrast with the strong mountainous fabric around it. The Snake River Plain lies in a distinct depression. At the western end, the base has dropped down along normal faults, forming a graben structure. Although there is extensive faulting at the eastern end, the structure is not as clear. Like the Columbia River region, volcanic eruptions dominate the story of the Snake River Plain in the eastern part of the Columbia Plateau Province. The earliest Snake River Plain eruptions began about 15 million years ago, just as the tremendous early eruptions of Columbia River Basalt were ending. But most of the Snake River Plain volcanic rock is less than a few million years old, Pliocene age (5-1.6 million years ago) and younger. In the west, the Columbia River Basalts are just that-almost exclusively black basalt. Not so in the Snake River Plain, where relatively quiet eruptions of soupy black basalt lava flows alternated with tremendous explosive eruptions of rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock. Cinder cones dot the landscape of the Snake River Plain. Some are aligned along vents, the fissures that fed flows and cone-building eruptions. Calderas, great pits formed by explosive volcanism, and low shield volcanoes, and rhyolite hills are also part of the landscape here, but many are obscured by later lava flows. Geologists usually associate volcanic eruptions with the boundaries between colliding or diverging plates. However, the focus of volcanism at Yellowstone in the Columbia Plateau Province is far inland from the subduction zone that lies along the Oregon and Washington coast. Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province, at the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth's moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau, and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas. Mammoth Hot Springs is evidence of Yellowstone thermal activity A probable explanation is that a hot spot, an extremely hot plume of deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. We know that beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at the boundary between the core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth. When the hot plume arrives at the base of the lithosphere, some of the lighter rock of the lithosphere rapidly melts. It is this molten lithosphere that becomes the basalt lavas that gush onto the surface to form the Columbia River and Snake River Plain basalts. The track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to Yellowstone National Park. The steaming fumaroles and explosive geysers are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hot spot is stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a record of the rate and direction of plate motion. Basin and Range The Basin and Range Province includes much of western North America. In the United States, it is bordered on the west by the eastern fault scarp of the Sierra Nevada and spans over to its eastern border marked by the Wasatch Fault, the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande Rift. The Basin and Range Province extends north to the Columbia Plateau and south as far as the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico, though the southern boundaries of the Basin and Range are debated. The Basin and Range province has a characteristic topography that is familiar to anyone who ventures across it. Steep climbs up elongate mountain ranges alternate with long treks across flat, dry deserts. This basic topographic pattern extends from eastern California to central Utah, and from southern Idaho into the state of Sonora in Mexico. The forces which created this distinct topography lie deep beneath the surface. The Basin and Range province, in central Nevada, as seen from space. Within the Basin and Range Province, the Earth's crust (and upper mantle) has been stretched up to 100% of its original width. The entire region has been subjected to extension that thinned and cracked the crust as it was pulled apart, creating large faults. Along these roughly north‚Äìsouth-trending faults mountains were uplifted and valleys down-dropped, producing the distinctive alternating pattern of linear mountain ranges and valleys of the Basin and Range province. Although there are other types of faults in the Basin and Range province, the extension and crustal stretching that have shaped the present landscape produce mostly normal faults. The upthrown side of these faults form mountains that rise abruptly and steeply, and the down-dropped side creates low valleys. The fault plane, along which the two sides of the fault move, extends deep in the crust, usually an angle of 60 degrees. In places, the relief or vertical difference between the two sides is as much as . As the rocky ranges rise, they are immediately subject to weathering and erosion. The exposed bedrock is attacked by water, ice, wind and other erosional agents. Rock particles are stripped away and wash down the mountain sides, often covering young faults until they rupture again. Sediment collects in the adjacent valleys, in some places burying the bedrock under thousands of feet of rock debris. Clarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an \\"army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico\\", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with The Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage). =Great Basin= The Great Basin is the geographical and hydrological region comprising most of Nevada, southern Oregon and Idaho, western Utah, and a little of eastern California. Characterized by internal drainage, this region's surface water sources evaporate or percolate before they can flow to the ocean. The Basin and Range province's dynamic fault history has profoundly affected the Great Basin's water drainage system. Most precipitation in the Great Basin falls in the form of snow that melts in the spring. Rain that reaches the ground, or snow that melts, quickly evaporates in the dry desert environment. Some of the water that does not evaporate sinks into the ground to become ground water. The remaining water flows into streams and collects in short-lived lakes called playas on the valley floor and eventually evaporates. Any water that falls as rain or snow into this region does not escape out of it; not one of the streams that originate within this basin ever find an outlet to the ocean. The extent of internal drainage, the area in which surface water cannot reach the ocean, defines the geographic region called the Great Basin. The Great Basin's internal drainage results from blockage of water movement by high fault-created mountains and by lack of sufficient water flow to merge with larger drainages outside of the Great Basin. This internally-drained area occupies approximately , including most of Nevada, a large part of Utah, and portions of Idaho, California, and Oregon. Much of the present-day Great Basin would drain to the sea, just as it did in the recent Ice Ages, if there were more rain and snowfall. Colorado Plateau The Colorado Plateau is roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. The sculptured beauty and brilliant colors of the Colorado Plateau's sedimentary rock layers have captured the imaginations of countless geologists. This is a vast region of plateaus, mesas, and deep canyons whose walls expose rocks ranging in age from billions to just a few hundred years old. Ancient Precambrian rocks, exposed only in the deepest canyons, make up the basement of the Colorado Plateau. Most are metamorphic rocks formed deep within the Earth while continental collision on a grand scale produced the nucleus of the North American continent well over a billion years ago. Igneous rocks injected millions of years later form a marbled network through parts of the Colorado Plateau's darker metamorphic basement. Cedar Mesa Sandstone forms the Druid Arch, in Canyonlands National Park These deeply-formed rocks were uplifted, eroded, and exposed for eons. By 600 million years ago, North America had been beveled off to a remarkably smooth surface. It is on this crystalline rock surface that the younger, more familiar layered rocks of the Colorado Plateau were deposited. Throughout the Paleozoic Era, the Colorado Plateau region was periodically inundated by tropical seas. Thick layers of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale were laid down in the shallow marine waters. During times when the seas retreated, stream deposits and dune sands were deposited or older layers were removed by erosion. Over 300 million years passed as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated. Crossbedded Navajo Sandstone in Zion National Park It was not until the upheavals that coincided with the formation of the supercontinent Pangea began about 250 million years ago that deposits of marine sediment waned and terrestrial deposits dominate. The Mesozoic Era sedimentary deposits are striking. Great accumulations of dune sand hardened to form sweeping arcs in cross-bedded sandstone. Eruptions from volcanic mountain ranges to the west buried vast regions beneath ashy debris. Short-lived rivers, lakes, and inland seas left sedimentary records of their passage. One of the most geologically intriguing features of the Colorado Plateau is its remarkable stability. Relatively little rock deformation (e.g., faulting and folding) has affected this high, thick crustal block within the last 600 million years or so. In contrast, the plateau is surrounded by provinces that have suffered severe deformation. Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth-stretching tension created the Basin and Range Province to the west and south. Although the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau may seem to have little in common, their geological stories are intimately intertwined. In the early part of this Era (Paleogene Period), both regions had low elevations of probably less than 1 kilometer. Geologists are still gathering evidence and debating what came next. Colorado and Green rivers Beginning about 20 million years ago, during the Miocene Epoch, both the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau regions were uplifted as much as 3 kilometers. Great tension developed in the crust, probably related to changing plate motions far to the west. As the crust stretched, the Basin and Range Province broke up into a multitude of down-dropped valleys and elongate mountains. Yet for some reason not fully understood, the neighboring Colorado Plateau was able to preserve its structural integrity and remained a single tectonic block. Eventually, the great block of Colorado Plateau crust rose a kilometer higher than the Basin and Range. As the land rose, the streams responded by cutting ever deeper stream channels. The most well-known of these streams, the Colorado River, began to carve the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago. The forces of erosion have exposed the vivid kaleidoscope of rock layers that make the Colorado Plateau a mecca for rock lovers. Rocky Mountain System Cathedral Group, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming The Rockies form a majestic mountain barrier that stretches from Canada through central New Mexico. Although formidable, a look at the topography reveals a discontinuous series of mountain ranges with distinct geological origins. The rocks making up the mountains were formed before the mountains were raised. The cores of the mountain ranges are in most places formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old. In the south, an older mountain range was formed 300 million years ago, then eroded away. The rocks of that older range were reformed into the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains took shape during a period of intense plate tectonic activity that formed much of the rugged landscape of the western United States. Three major mountain-building episodes reshaped the west from about 170 to 40 million years ago (Jurassic to Cenozoic Periods). The last mountain building event, the Laramide orogeny, (about 70-40 million years ago) the last of the three episodes, is responsible for raising the Rocky Mountains. During the last half of the Mesozoic Era, the Age of the Dinosaurs, much of today's California, Oregon, and Washington were added to North America. western North America suffered the effects of repeated collision as slabs of ocean crust sank beneath the continental edge. Slivers of continental crust, carried along by subducting ocean plates, were swept into the subduction zone and scraped onto North America's edge. About 200‚Äì300 miles inland, magma generated above the subducting slab rose into the North American continental crust. Great arc-shaped volcanic mountain ranges grew as lava and ash spewed out of dozens of individual volcanoes. Beneath the surface, great masses of molten rock were injected and hardened in place. For 100 million years the effects of plate collisions were focused very near the edge of the North American plate boundary, far to the west of the Rocky Mountain region. It was not until 70 million years ago that these effects began to reach the Rockies. The growth of the Rocky Mountains has been one of the most perplexing of geologic puzzles. Normally, mountain building is focused between 200 and 400 miles inland from a subduction zone boundary, yet the Rockies are hundreds of miles farther inland. Although geologists continue to gather evidence to explain the rise of the Rockies, the answer most likely lies with an unusual subducting slab. At a 'typical' subduction zone, an oceanic plate typically sinks at a fairly high angle (see above). A volcanic arc grows above the subducting plate. During the growth of the Rocky Mountains, the angle of the subducting plate may have been significantly flattened, moving the focus of melting and mountain building much farther inland than is normally expected. The Laramide orogeny was caused by subduction at an unusually shallow angle. It is postulated that the shallow angle of the subducting plate greatly increased the friction and other interactions with the thick continental mass above it. Tremendous thrusts piled sheets of crust on top of each other, building the extraordinarily broad, high Rocky Mountain range. As of 60 million years ago, the Rockies were like Tibet: a high plateau, probably above sea level. Since then, erosion stripped away the high rocks, revealing the ancestral rocks beneath, and forming the current landscape of the Rockies. Periods of glaciation occurred from the Pleistocene Epoch (1.8 million‚Äì70,000 years ago) to the Holocene Epoch (fewer than 11,000 years ago). The ice ages left their mark on the Rockies, forming extensive glacial landforms, such as U-shaped valleys and cirques. Laurentian Upland Every continent has a core of very ancient metamorphic rocks. The Superior Upland Province is the southern extension of the Laurentian Upland Province, part of the nucleus of North America called Canadian Shield. The basement rocks of the Laurentian Upland Province were metamorphosed about 2500 million years ago in a mountain-building collision of tectonic plates called the Kenoran Orogeny. The rocks of the Superior Upland are mostly Precambrian metamorphic rocks and overlying Paleozoic rocks (Cambrian) covered by a thin veneer of glacial deposits left behind when glaciers melted at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age. If we could strip away all of the younger rocks deposited on top of buried Precambrian basement, you would see a landscape of low relief. The topography of the Precambrian rocks is very subdued, with barely 500 feet difference between the highest point and the lowest. Clearly, this region was exposed to a very long period of erosion in the very distant past which beveled the original mountainous surface to a gently undulating surface. The present surface is not much different. Hills rise just a few hundred feet above the surrounding countryside. The highest of these, such as Rib Hill, Wisconsin, are made up mostly of resistant quartzite or granite. The north shore of Lake Superior showing lava that erupted more than 1 billion years ago The structure of Superior Upland rock is quite complex. Folds and faults, most dating back to Precambrian time, record several episodes of mountain-building. The plate collisions that formed the core of our continent left behind a striking structural trend. Ridges and valleys are strongly aligned along this northeast‚Äìsouthwest trend. Lake Superior is an example of this northeast‚Äìsouthwest structural trend. Ridges of erosion-resistant rock rise above valleys and carved into weaker rock units. The effects of repeated glaciation have left their mark on the Superior Upland. The present glacial topography is the product of the most recent glaciation that ended just 10,000 years ago. During the Late Wisconsin, the last glaciation of the Pleistocene Epoch, a massive continental ice sheet grew first in the north, then gradually expanded southward. Several thick finger- like lobes of glacial ice engulfed the region as they moved through the Superior basin. Rocks of all sizes were plucked and scoured from farther north and carried along by the icy mass. When the continental ice sheets melt, they left behind an assortment of rock called glacial drift that covers much of the Superior Upland landscape. Interior Plains The Interior Plains is a vast region that spreads across the stable core of North America. This area had formed when several small continents collided and welded together well over a billion years ago, during the Precambrian. Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks now form the basement of the Interior Plains and make up the stable nucleus of North America. With the exception of the Black Hills of South Dakota, the entire region has low relief, reflecting more than 500 million years of relative tectonic stability. Throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras the mostly low-lying Interior Plains region remained relatively unaffected by the mountain-building tectonic collisions suffered by the western and eastern margins of the continent. Prairie and low hills in the Oglala National Grassland, Nebraska During much of the Mesozoic Era, the North American continental interior was mostly well above sea level, with two notable exceptions. During part of the Jurassic (208-144 million years ago), rising seas flooded the low-lying areas of the continent. Much of the Interior Plains eventually lay submerged beneath the shallow Sundance Sea. Sediments eroding from the rising Rocky Mountains to the west washed into the sea and deposited as layered wedges of fine debris. As sand, mud, and clays accumulated, the Sundance Sea retreated northward. Preserved within the multi- hued sandstones, mudstones, and clays that made up the shoreline, are the remains of countless dinosaurs that roamed the Sundance coast. The fossil assemblages concealed within the sedimentary layers of the Morrison Formation are among the world's richest. In some areas, bones of many dinosaurs are concentrated in a very small area, indicating that they were carried during floods, then deposited together beside a stream. Once again, during the Cretaceous Period (144-65 million years ago), record high sea levels flooded the continental interior with shallow seas. The Interior Plains continued to receive deposits from the eroding Rocky Mountains to the west and Appalachian and Ozark/Ouachita Mountains to the east and south throughout the most recent Era, the Cenozoic. The flatness of the Interior Plains is a reflection of the platform of mostly flat-lying marine and stream deposits laid down in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. Appalachians, Interior Highlands, and Atlantic Plains Paleogeographic reconstruction showing the Appalachian Basin area during the Middle Devonian period. The rocks of the Appalachian, Ouachita, Ozark Mountains are old and share a common origin. They largely consist of sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age that were deposited on the sea floor and are presently folded and faulted. The Appalachians also have volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient sea floor. These mountains were once part of a mighty uplifted mountain range that stretch from the Appalachian Highlands through Texas. During the earliest Paleozoic Era, the continent that would later become North America straddled the equator. The Appalachian region was a passive plate margin, not unlike today's Atlantic Coastal Plain Province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallows seas. Thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock was deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated. During the middle Ordovician Period (about 440‚Äì480 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once quiet, Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. Animation of Pangea breaking up This was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians. Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years (Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghenian orogenies). The Pangean supercontinent began to take shape. Microplates, smaller bits of crust too small to be called continents, were swept in, one by one, to be welded to the growing mass. By about 300 million years ago (Pennsylvanian Period) Africa was approaching North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the Ozark-Ouachita region and through the Marathon Mountains of Texas. Continent vs. continent collision raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to lofty, Himalayan-scale ranges. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic Era (Permian Period) when Africa (Gondwana) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the core. From about 280-230 million years ago, (Late Paleozoic Era until the Late Triassic) the continent we now know as North America was continuous with Africa, South America, and Europe. During the Late Triassic, Pangea began to be torn apart when a three-pronged fissure grew between Africa, South America, and North America. Rifting began as magma welled up through the weakness in the crust, creating a volcanic rift zone. Volcanic eruptions spewed ash and volcanic debris across the landscape as these severed continent-sized fragments of Pangea diverged. The gash between the spreading continents gradually grew to form a new ocean basin, the Atlantic. The rift zone known as the mid-Atlantic ridge continued to provide the raw volcanic materials for the expanding ocean basin. North America was slowly pulled westward away from the rift zone. The thick continental crust that made up the new east coast collapsed into a series of down-dropped fault blocks that roughly parallel today's coastline. At first, the hot, faulted edge of the continent was high and buoyant relative to the new ocean basin. As the edge of North America moved away from the hot rift zone, it began to cool and subside beneath the new Atlantic Ocean. This once-active divergent plate boundary became the passive, trailing edge of westward moving North America. In plate tectonic terms, the Atlantic Plain is known as a classic example of a passive continental margin. During the rifting, South America tore away from North America and headed southward. The ocean flooded into the opening between the two continents, forming the Gulf of Mexico. A record of this rifting event remains as an indelible mark on the landscape called Mississippi Embayment. It is this embayment that ripped the dramatic gap between the southern Appalachians and the Ouachita-Ozark Highlands. Weathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away. By the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian-Ouachita Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain. Sediments eroded from these highlands were carried east and southward by streams and gradually covered the faulted continental margin, burying it under a wedge, thousands of feet thick, of layered sedimentary and volcanic debris. Today most Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rock layers that lie beneath much of the coastal plain and fringing continental shelf remain nearly horizontal or tilt gently toward the sea. During the Cenozoic, the geology of the different regions diverged. The Appalachians started to uplift, while the Ouachita and Ozarks did not. The uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures. Alaska Most of Alaska consists of terranes accreted by collisions with island arcs carried in over the last 160 million years. These terranes were caused by the subduction of the Farallon, Kula, and Pacific plates sequentially. Currently, the Pacific plate is subducting beneath Alaska, producing the Aleutian arc series of volcanoes through the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands. One of the sutures left by terrane addition is the Denali Fault, which curves through south-central Alaska. The Denali Fault bends just north of Denali. The combination of the subduction of the Pacific plate and the bend in the Denali Fault causes Denali to be the highest mountain in North America. Hawaii The State of Hawaii consists of a chain of islands, or archipelago. The archipelago developed as the Pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at a rate of approximately per million years. Thus, the southeast island (Hawaii) is volcanically active whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods. From this study and others, it is estimated that the northwesternmost island, the Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while Hawaii, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on Hawaii and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Loihi. Almost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaii are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.

It is 37 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council, in the Northern Beaches region. The area was previously called Avalon, with the name Avalon Beach being assigned during a change in boundaries and names in the Pittwater region in 2012.  History  The Pittwater and Northern Beaches area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country. = European settlement = Avalon was named after the mythical Avalon, a legendary island in Celtic languages mythology. According to legends, Avalon was an earthly paradise and the final resting place of King Arthur.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 13 The first land grant in the area was to John Farrell in 1827. In 1833 a land grant was made to Australia's first Catholic priest, John Joseph Therry, by Governor Bourke. A further grant of 280 acres made in 1837 meant that Therry's holdings covered most of the peninsula from Newport to Whale Beach. He built a church in this area but his plans for a settlement never eventuated. Therry fought hard for the recognition of the Catholic Church in the colony. After he died, the land was left to the Jesuit order and was then sold to help finance the rebuilding of St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. In the 1920s, the area was still known as 'Priest's Flat'. Arthur J Small handled a subdivision in 1921 and chose the name Avalon. Lots were sold for ¬£100 each and included two year's free membership in the local golf club. Significant housing developments took place during the 1920s. The architect Alexander Stewart Jolly designed a number of houses that were built in the Avalon area in that period. Loggan Rock was a flamboyant log cabin combined with a stone tower; the combination of logs and rocks gave rise to the name. The house is heritage-listed.State Heritage Website Careel House is a bungalow made of stone that was quarried in the area. Nowadays it is on the Whale Beach side of the boundary. It is also heritage-listed.State Heritage Website Hy Brasil, located near Clareville, was built in 1936, but was originally known as The Gem. Later it was bought by Ted Herman, son of the painter Sali Herman, who changed the name, using the name of a mythical island west of Ireland. It is heritage-listed.State Heritage Website A sandstone cottage known as Wickham, designed by Walter Burley Griffin, was unfortunately demolished with council approval in 1994. Another significant development was the creation of Ruskin Rowe in 1950. This street was designed as an estate by the architect Harry Ruskin Rowe, son of the architect Thomas Rowe. Rowe created covenants to preserve the character of the estate, but they have been ignored to an extent over the years. Nevertheless, the estate is heritage-listed because of its historic significance, as well as its scientific significance in preserving the bushland environment of the area.State Heritage Website = Early subdivision plans = File:Avalon Beach Estate Plateau Rd, Park Reserve, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Beach Estate Plateau Rd, Park Reserve, 1921-1926 File:Avalon Beach Central Estate, Avalon Pde, Barrenjoey Rd, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Beach Central Estate, Avalon Pde, Barrenjoey Rd, 1921-1926 File:Avalon Beach Estates, Central Rd, Plateau Rd, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Beach Estates, Central Rd, Plateau Rd, 1921-1926 File:Avalon Sanctuary Estate, Park Ave, 1921-1926.jpgAvalon Sanctuary Estate, Park Ave, 1921-1926 Heritage listings Avalon Beach has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 32 Plateau Road: Walter Burley Griffin Lodge * 111 Whale Beach Road: Loggan Rock Demographics According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 9,905 residents in Avalon Beach. 73.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 9.6%, New Zealand 2.0% and United States of America 1.1%. 90.2% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 43.0%, Catholic 19.4% and Anglican 18.6%.  Commercial areas  Avalon Beach features an RSL club, a surf club, bowling and sailing clubs; a golf club, a supermarket, shops, offices, cafes and a cinema. Cuisines include French, Vietnamese, Italian, Mexican, American Diner, Japanese, Thai and other Asian. There is a book shop, hairdresser, artisan bakery, petrol station, Red Cross Shop, bottle shop, many real estate agents, hardware store, florists and many homewares and dress shops. It is unique in that this large commercial centre is separated from the beach only by the road, a fact which until recently was used to argue against commercialisation of the beach side buildings themselves as restaurants and cafes were already so close to the beach.  Sport and recreation  Avalon Beach is a surfing beach and has a 25-metre salt water rock pool at the south end. Avalon Beach SLSC members patrol Avalon Beach. Several former surfing world champions are also past or current Avalon residents; including Ben Player. Avalon Soccer Club, established 1982, has over 80 teams and 1000 registered players. Avalon Junior Rugby League Club has contributed several players active in the Australian National Rugby League. Avalon also has a small nine-hole golf course. Pittwater Council has created the Bangalley Headland Walk, which goes through part of the Careel Headland Reserve. The track starts at Whale Beach Road and goes to Marine Parade. St Michaels Cave is an interesting coastal feature.  Schools  * Barrenjoey High School * Avalon Public School * Maria Regina Catholic Primary School * Montessori public school on the former grounds of Barrenjoey Highschool  Culture/politics  An episode of the American television show Baywatch was shot at Avalon Beach in the late 1990s. Producers of the show, seeking to relocate from their Californian base due to cost constraints, proposed a full relocation to Avalon and promised an upgrading of the SLSC in return, painting a huge sign saying \\"Avalon Beach\\" across the surf club. However, following complaints from residents (supported by former world surfing champion and local property owner Mark Warren), the series moved instead to Hawaii. The anti-Baywatch supporters were led by former Pittwater mayor Alex McTaggart, who was subsequently elected to NSW State Parliament for two years. In 2011-13 there was a move by the Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving club officials, led by Christine Hopton, to replace the existing surf club. The development went ahead despite opposition from local residents in the land and environment court.
