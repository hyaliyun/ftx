Life and career Jerrick was raised in Wichita, Kansas, and attended Chaplain Kapaun Memorial High School, a Jesuit-run boys' school (now defunct; merged to become Kapaun Mount Carmel Catholic High School). The Wichita native started his career at Topeka's WIBW-TV in Kansas (when fellow colleague Steve Doocy was doing the weather at WIBW's crosstown rival, KSNT-TV). Jerrick's boyish looks and charisma soon took him to WNYW in New York as a producer and later host, before moving to San Francisco's KPIX-TV.

He was associated with a number of movies, including Goddess (1922), The Light of Asia (1925), Shiraz (1928), A Throw of Dice (1929) and Karma (1933). He was married to actress Devika Rani Chaudhuri (1908‚Äì1994). Biography Born into an aristocratic Bengali family, he spent several years in Santiniketan for his schooling. After obtaining a law-degree from Kolkata, he went to London to become a barrister. There, he met a playwright and screenwriter Niranjan Pal. That association led to the making of a film, The Light of Asia, which he co- directed with Franz Osten. Rai was also one of the main actors in this film. While making his third film, Prapancha Pash, he met and fell in love with Devika Rani, a great-grandniece of the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Before this film was complete, he married her. Bombay Talkies Devika Rani kissing Himanshu Rai in Karma (1933) At Bombay Talkies studio, Rai partnered with Sashadhar Mukherjee, and Mukherjee's brother in law worked as a technician in the studio. Due to suspected romantic liaisons between his wife and the leading man in one film, Himanshu sacked the leading man and cast the gawky, awkward-looking and reluctant brother-in-law Ashok Kumar as the leading man. Kumar went on to have a successful career in films. After Rai's death, there was a struggle for studio control. His widow Devika Rani was in conflict with Sashadhar Mukherjee. Eventually there was dual control and alternate production of films by the two camps. During this era Mukherjee produced the studio's biggest hit Kismet in 1943. Then Mukherjee broke away to form Filmistan Studio in partnership, and Devika Rani, fully in charge of the studio, did not have as much success. In 1945, Devika Rani married Svetoslav Roerich and moved away from Bombay and films. Ashok Kumar and Mukherjee made a bid to revive Bombay talkies and produced one big hit in Mahal. Eventually the studio shut down and is now a decrepit property in Malad.

The film is an unofficial sequel to his 1989 film Roadkill; although focusing on different characters, it centres on a road trip beginning in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where the road trip depicted in the earlier film ended. Synopsis The film stars Don McKellar as Pokey Jones, an orphaned barber in a small town near Thunder Bay, who dreams of becoming a jazz musician. One morning, Jones discovers a frozen corpse (Steve Fall) in his backyard, and soon meets Jackie Bangs (Valerie Buhagiar), a tough and mysterious roadie who claims the dead man is her brother. Jackie's real intention is to use the body, a vagrant unknown to anyone in town, to smuggle stolen drugs into the United States. She convinces Pokey to use his parents' car, which has not been driven in decades, to drive her to New Orleans to bury her brother. So Jackie and Pokey set out along Highway 61, coffin strapped to the top of the car, and follow Bob Dylan's famous U.S. Highway 61 south through the heart of the United States. They are pursued by Mr. Skin (Earl Pastko), who believes he is Satan and wants to claim the body because the dead man sold Mr. Skin his soul. Peter Breck is fourth- billed as Mr. Watson, the \\"stage-mom\\" father of three girls: Mississippi (Missy), Minnesota (Minnie), and Louisiana (Louise). The film also includes cameo appearances by Tav Falco, Jello Biafra, and Art Bergmann. The film's soundtrack album includes songs by Bourbon Tabernacle Choir, Rita Chiarelli, Nash the Slash, Acid Test, Jellyfishbabies, and Tom Jones.

The Japp-Klingemann reaction The hydrazone products of the Japp‚ÄìKlingemann reaction are most often used as intermediates in syntheses of more complex organic molecules. For example, a phenylhydrazone product can be heated in the presence of strong acid to produce an indole via the Fischer indole synthesis. The Japp-Klingemann reaction used to synthesize indoles Reaction mechanism To illustrate the mechanism, the Japp-Klingemann ester variation will be considered. The first step is the deprotonation of the Œ≤-keto-ester. The nucleophilic addition of the enolate anion 2 to the diazonium salt produces the azo compound 3. Intermediate 3 has been isolated in rare cases. However, in most cases, the hydrolysis of intermediate 3 produces a tetrahedral intermediate 4, which quickly decomposes to release the carboxylic acid 6. After hydrogen exchange, the final hydrazone 7 is produced.

Illustration dates from the early nineteenth century. Parachute of Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin Garnerin releases the balloon and descends with the help of a parachute, 1797. Illustration from the late 19th century. Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin (31 January, 1769 ‚Äì 18 August, 1823) was a French balloonist and the inventor of the frameless parachute. He was appointed Official Aeronaut of France. Biography Garnerin was born in Paris. He was captured by British troops during the first phase of the French Revolutionary Wars 1792‚Äì1797, turned over to the Austrians and held as a prisoner of war in Buda in Hungary for three years. Balloons and parachutes =Ballooning= Garnerin, a student of the ballooning pioneer professor Jacques Charles, was involved with the flight of hot air balloons, and worked with his older brother Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Garnerin (1766‚Äì1849) in most of his ballooning activities. Eventually he was appointed Official Aeronaut of France. Garnerin began experiments with early parachutes based on umbrella-shaped devices and carried out the first frameless parachute descent (in the gondola) with a silk parachute on 22 October 1797 at Parc Monceau, Paris (1st Brumaire, Year VI of the Republican calendar). Garnerin's first parachute was made of white canvas with a diameter of approximately 23 feet (7 m).Techno Science ‚Äì Profile Andre Garnerin The umbrella was closed before he ascended, with a pole running down its center and a rope running through a tube in the pole, which connected it to the balloon. Garnerin rode in a basket attached to the bottom of the parachute; at a height of approximately he severed the rope that connected his parachute to the balloon. The balloon continued skyward while Garnerin, with his basket and parachute, fell. The basket swung violently during descent,In 1804 J√©r√¥me Lalande introduced a vent in the canopy to eliminate violent oscillations. then bumped and scraped when it landed, but Garnerin emerged uninjured. Garnerin went on to stage regular tests and demonstrations at Parc Monceau, Paris, on 22 October, 1797, which became a cause c√©l√®bre when he announced in 1798 that his next flight would include a woman as a passenger. Although the public and press were in favour, he was forced to appear in front of officials of the Central Bureau of Police to justify his project. They were concerned about the effect that reduced air pressure might have on the organs of the delicate female body and loss of consciousness, plus the moral implications of flying in such close proximity. Unsatisfied with Garnerin's responses, the police issued an injunction against him, forbidding the ascent on the grounds that the young woman was committing herself to the venture without any idea of the possible outcome. After further consultation with both the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of the Police the injunction was overturned on the grounds that \\"there was no more scandal in seeing two people of different gender ascend in a balloon than it is to see them jump into a carriage.\\" They also agreed that the decision of the woman showed proof of her confidence in the experiment and a degree of personal intrepidity. Citoyenne Henri had already been chosen, so when the ban was lifted Garnerin was ready to proceed. He advertised the ascent in L'Ami des Lois (a Parisian newspaper published from 1795‚Äì1798Gutenberg ‚Äì Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, Hanley) : On 8 July 1798 a large number of spectators gathered in the Parc Monceau to witness the ascent. By all accounts Citoyenne Henri was young and beautiful, and she and Garnerin took several turns around the park to the applause of the crowd before she was assisted into the basket of the balloon by the astronomer, J√©r√¥me Lalande. The balloon trip passed without incident and the journey ended at Goussainville about to the north of Paris. Touring England Andr√©-Jacques held the position of Official Aeronaut of France, so with his wife Jeanne Genevi√®ve he visited England in 1802 during the Peace of Amiens and the couple completed a number of demonstration flights. In the evening of 21 September, 1802, Andr√©-Jacques ascended in his hydrogen balloon from the Volunteer Ground in North Audley Street, Grosvenor Square and made a parachute descent to a field near St Pancras.History Today Volume: 52 Issue: 9 2002 ‚Äì Monsieur Garnerin Drops In by John Lucas This gave rise to the English popular ballad: :Bold Garnerin went up :Which increased his Repute :And came safe to earth :In his Grand Parachute.Flights of Fancy He also made his second English balloon ascent with Edward Hawke Locker on 5 July, 1802 from Lord's Cricket Ground, travelling the 17 miles (27.4 km) from there to Chingford in just over 15 minutes and carrying a letter of introduction signed by the Prince Regent to give to anyone should he crash land.Image of the second ascent However, when the war between France and Great Britain resumed they were forced to pack up and return to the continent where, on 3‚Äì4 October 1803, he covered a distance of 245 miles (395 km) between Paris and Clausen, Germany, with his balloon.

It currently has a capacity of 17,500 with terracing and a members area holding 750, though capacity was capped at 10,000 for Fremantle AFLW games.https://thewest.com.au/sport/aflw/dockers-go-down-to-brisbane-as- womens-footy-arrives-in-wa-ng-b88384240z Fremantle Oval was originally used for cricket, but in 1895 hosted its first game of Australian rules football and Australian Football quickly became the main attraction leading to the development of the ground. It is located between the Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle Markets and the Fremantle Prison. South Fremantle Football Club train and play their home WAFL matches at the ground and are one of the few sporting organisations in Western Australia to own their club rooms freehold, rather than on a long-term lease. Additionally, the oval is the primary home ground of the Fremantle Dockers women's team. The ground was also the training and administrative home of the Fremantle Football Club until February 2017, and has also hosted pre-season matches featuring Fremantle.  History  Originally known as Barracks Green Field, the area was used by the Pensioner Guards who were used primarily as guards for Fremantle Prison which house convict and ticket of leave prisoners. In 1861 Manning raised a Volunteer defence force, who used the ground for manoeuvers, parades with volunteer bands providing entertainment. As Australian Rules Football developed in the late 19th century the ground became the base for the Fremantle Football Club and hosted many early WAFL as well as interstate games. Facilities remained relatively basic until 1897 when the Victoria Pavilion was built. The large stately structure provided seating for 500 people as well as club rooms located in the basement. By 1901 South Fremantle Football Club and East Fremantle Football Club were established as regular cotenants of Fremantle Oval. The oval also hosted Fremantle Cricket Club and a cycling track that was in regular use throughout the year. In March 1907 Western Australia hosted New South Wales in the oval's only recorded first-class cricket match. New South Wales had three players (Warren Bardsley, Charles Macartney, and Roy Minnett) who had represented Australia in Test cricket whilst Western Australia had one (Ernie Jones). Western Australia won by 5 runs.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/546054.html East Fremantle Football Club vacated the ground in 1950, moving to new premises, located at Moss Street in East Fremantle. In 1954 the oval was used for a ceremonial parade as part of Queen Elizabeth II's first visit to Fremantle. The Cycling Track and Cricket Pitch were removed in the 1960s due to the increasing demands of WAFL football. The ground remained relatively unchanged until 1968 when the South Fremantle Football Club acquired a portion of land freehold at the hospital end of the ground for the construction of social club, members pavilion and players changerooms. Further improvements were made to the ground with the growing demands of larger WAFL crowds in the 1960s and 1970s. These included a shelter behind the goals at the prison end of the ground and a large one at the hospital end of the ground named the Doig Pavilion. A three level press box was constructed adjacent to the Victoria Pavilion. The eastern outer area of the ground was also fully terraced with concrete kerbing so as to allow for greater crowd capacity. Statue of John Gerovich's spectacular mark in the 1956 WAFL preliminary final. Fremantle Oval's 1890s Victoria Pavilion is in the background. The late 1970s witnessed a peak in crowd attendance at Fremantle Oval with over 23,000 people attending the Foundation Day Derby in 1979. Large crowds continued to flock to the ground into the early 1980s with the WAFL proving to be the most popular spectator sport in the State. From 1980 to 1985 the oval hosted Motorcross racing during the summer. Noise complaints from nearby Fremantle Hospital and the availability of more suitable venues lead to the racing moving. In 1986 the ground underwent its most dramatic structural change with the works related to the Parry Street extension, demolishing the historic Henderson Street and South Terrace entrance gates as well reducing the capacity of the ground on the western side. New entrance gates were built on Parry Street, however the South Terrace gates were never replaced. In 1987, the entry of the West Coast Eagles into the expanded VFL competition lead to a dramatic decline in WAFL attendances. In 1995 this was compounded by the entry of the Fremantle Dockers into the AFL. Attendances dropped from an average of 8000 in the early 1980s to 3000 in the early 90s and 2000 in 1999. The Fremantle Dockers established a base at the oval and in 1999 constructed a new training facility. This required the demolition of the Doig Pavilion and the levelling of the historic hospital end hill area that had once been one of the most popular positions for the general public to watch football matches from. In 2017, the Dockers AFLW team began playing most home games at the oval. The oval also continues to host WAFL matches as well as AFL pre season games. It is also used a venue for conferences, rock concerts (including the Big Day Out) and exhibitions. Record crowd 23,109, when South Fremantle beat East Fremantle on 4 June 1979.

During cooling, however, wafer temperatures must be brought down slowly to prevent dislocations and wafer breakage due to thermal shock. Such rapid heating rates are often attained by high intensity lamps or lasers. These processes are used for a wide variety of applications in semiconductor manufacturing including dopant activation, thermal oxidation, metal reflow and chemical vapor deposition. Temperature Control One of the key challenges in rapid thermal processing is accurate measurement and control of the wafer temperature. Monitoring the ambient with a thermocouple has only recently become feasible, in that the high temperature ramp rates prevent the wafer from coming to thermal equilibrium with the process chamber. One temperature control strategy involves in situ pyrometry to effect real time control. Used for melting iron for welding purposes. Rapid Thermal Anneal Rapid thermal anneal (RTA) is a subset of Rapid Thermal Processing. It is a process used in semiconductor device fabrication which consists of heating a single wafer at a time in order to affect its electrical properties. Unique heat treatments are designed for different effects. Wafers can be heated in order to activate dopants, change film-to-film or film-to-wafer substrate interfaces, densify deposited films, change states of grown films, repair damage from ion implantation, move dopants or drive dopants from one film into another or from a film into the wafer substrate. Rapid thermal anneals are performed by equipment that heats a single wafer at a time using either lamp based heating, a hot chuck, or a hot plate that a wafer is brought near. Unlike furnace anneals they are short in duration, processing each wafer in several minutes. To achieve short annealing times and quick throughput, sacrifices are made in temperature and process uniformity, temperature measurement and control, and wafer stress. Recently, RTP-like processing has found applications in another rapidly growing field‚Äîsolar cell fabrication. RTP-like processing, in which an increase in the temperature of the semiconductor sample is produced by the absorption of the optical flux, is now used for a host of solar cell fabrication steps, including phosphorus diffusion for N/P junction formation and impurity gettering, hydrogen diffusion for impurity and defect passivation, and formation of screen-printed contacts using Ag-ink for the front and Al-ink for back contacts, respectively.

The overwhelming majority of the so-called half-Jews were legally classified as \\"first-degree Jewish hybrids\\" during the National Socialist era. Occasionally, the term was used even before the National Socialist era. Within Judaism the term half Jew is unusual, since it only knows \\"whole\\" Jews, namely born into the cultural community (\\"Jewish is he who has a Jewish mother\\") or converted by Giyur.  Situation within the German Reich  During the National Socialist era, half-Jews was not a legal term. The term was not used in the Nuremberg Race Laws and the related ordinances. In 1941 the keyword half-Jew was included in the Duden for the first time: The group of \\"Jewish half-breeds\\" was further divided into \\"Jewish half-breeds of the first degree\\" with two Jewish grandparents and \\"Jewish half-breeds of the second degree\\" with one Jewish grandparent. However, first- degree hybrids were classified in different categories, despite the assumption of the same \\"biological-racial ancestry\\": They were not regarded as \\"hybrids\\" but as \\"full Jews\\" if they belonged to the Jewish religious community, were married to a Jew or married a Jew after 1935. The term \\"Geltungsjude\\" was later coined for this group of \\"half-Jews\\". This differentiated classification, which is blurred by the term \\"Halbjude\\", was of existential importance for those affected. If they were classified unfavourably, they were not admitted to university; they were forced to work at an early stage or were refused a marriage permit. During the Second World War, in marital union with a \\"full Jew\\", \\"half-Jews\\" classified as \\"Jews of Geltungsjuden\\" were deported with their spouses to ghettos or extermination camps. This danger also threatened \\"half-Jewish\\" children if the non-Jewish spouse had converted to the Jewish faith, and even if the spouses separated again to spare the children persecution. This is meticulously documented using the example of a family from the Weimar-Apolda-Jena region. National Socialists tried - as discussed at the Wannsee Conference - to classify all \\"half-Jews\\" legally as \\"full Jews\\" and to deport them. The fact that many \\"half-Jews\\" were also \\"half-Christians\\" was always ignored.  Situation in the Occupied Territories  In the occupied Eastern territories, \\"half-Jews\\" were included in the extermination process indiscriminately like \\"full Jews\\". The Jewish Department at the Reich Main Security Office attempted to influence the controversial decision-making process within the Reich by also creating facts in the Western occupation areas. In August 1941 Adolf Eichmann, in agreement with Arthur Sey√ü-Inquart, decided to equate the \\"half-Jews\\" living in the Netherlands with the \\"full Jews\\" and to deport them. As of May 1942, \\"half-Jews\\" were also obliged to wear the Jewish star there.  Term after 1945  The term \\"Halbjude\\" was used by various people even after the war. Therefore Ignaz Bubis criticized 1999: The use of the term Halbjude has also established itself in the English-speaking world as \\"half-Jewish\\" or \\"part-Jewish\\", whereby the more scientific term \\"Beta Gershom\\" is already mentioned in the Bible. In other languages, the word \\"Father-Jew\\", introduced by Andreas Burnier in 1995, has since spread, marking the fact that the father is a Jew, but not the mother. This term is related to the provisions of the Halakha, according to which Jewish religious affiliation is usually derived by birth from a Jewish mother.  Earlier history of the term  There are few places where the term \\"Halbjude\\" is used historically. The unpopular ruler Herod was insulted as a \\"half-Jew\\" because his family came from Idum√§a, an area that had been forcibly converted to Judaism. Since he was crowned king of Judea by Rome, the term \\"half-Jewish\\" can be interpreted as a vague, derogatory term for \\"Jew, but not serving Jewish interests\\", similar to later in other contexts \\"house-negro‚Äù as opposed to \\"field-negro\\" in Malcolm X. In 1881, the anti-Semite Eugen D√ºhring clearly used the term The Jewish Question as a question of race, morals and culture as a derogatory hereditary biological term in his writing \\"Die Judenfrage\\".

Wyant worked during his teens as a sign painter in nearby Port Washington. In 1857 he was impressed with some paintings by George Inness at an exhibition in Cincinnati and soon left for New York to meet Inness. After returning to Cincinnati, Wyant secured the support of Nicholas Longworth and went to study in New York in 1860. He went on a trip that started in Paris in 1860 where he saw Corot and Dupr√©'s works before moving on to Germany.Press Company Frontier Press Company. (2004) Masters of Achievement, Kessinger Publishing. p. 929. . After an interlude of two years in Cincinnati, he moved back to New York City in 1863. He exhibited for the first time at the National Academy of Design in 1864 and was elected an associate there in 1868 and an academician in 1869. Wyant went abroad in 1865, studying for a few months with the Norwegian painter Hans Gude in D√ºsseldorf and Karlsruhe, Germany, and making brief stops in England and Ireland before settling again in New York. After 1866 Wyant gradually shifted toward a more fluid handling of paint, with increasing reliance on a palette emphasizing shades of white, gray, and the earth colors. From 1867 he exhibited his watercolors almost annually and was instrumental in the founding of the American Watercolor Society in 1878. A partial stroke while on a government expedition to Arizona and New Mexico in 1873 led to paralysis of his right arm. Between 1874 and 1880 he worked in his studio in New York City, teaching himself to paint with his left hand. After his marriage in 1880, he began to spend most of his time in Keene Valley, New York. He moved in 1889 to Arkville, New York (in the Catskills). He frequently painted in the Adirondacks as well as in the Catskills. He died in 1892 in New York City shortly after completing Arkville Autumn Landscape, his last painting. He was only moderately appreciated during his lifetime, though after his death his works were eagerly sought for. Career Tennessee, Alexander H. Wyant, Metropolitan Museum of Art Wyant's signature style was developed slowly and not without several false starts along the way. Special contributions came from his initial contact with Inness shortly after that artist's sojourn in France; the startling revelations disclosed to Wyant by his study of John Constable and J. M. W. Turner and his stroke in 1873, which accelerated the artist's movement away from the sort of detailed examination of natural facts that one finds, for example, in his well-known, Mohawk Valley, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In his later years Wyant's solitary, introspective mood came to blend more closely than ever with his landscapes, especially those from the Arkville area at the Pakatakan Artists Colony, where a kindred spirit, J. F. Murphy, also worked. He was a member of the Century Association and the National Academy of Design, to which he was elected in 1869. Exhibitions included the following venues: National Academy of Design, 1865‚Äì1892; Brooklyn Art Association, 1867‚Äì1892; Boston Art Club, 1877‚Äì1882; Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, 1879‚Äì1881; Art Institute of Chicago; and Metropolitan Museum of Art.

It is in the city's West End, facing Glossop Road and close to the main campus of University of Sheffield and the Collegiate Crescent campus of Sheffield Hallam University. The hospital is run by the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital, which replaced both the Sheffield Royal Hospital and the Sheffield Royal Infirmary, was designed by Adams, Holden and Pearson and built in two phases; the first phase, a three-storey out-patients department was completed in 1971. The second phase, the main building, was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1978. The main building was designed as three main interlinked buildings, the most significant being the monolithic 21-storey concrete structure, which remains the third highest in Sheffield after St Paul's Tower and the Arts Tower. It was designed with the rear part of the building overhanging a service road. Operation of the hospital was transferred from the Sheffield Health Authority (dissolved on 1 April 1992) to the newly-created Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust on 1 November 1991. On 1 April 2001, the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust merged with the Northern General Hospital NHS Trust to create the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, which was later awarded Foundation status on 1 July 2004. The Jessop Wing, which replaced the Jessop Hospital for Women as a provider of maternity and gynecology services, was designed by the George Trew Dunn Partnership and opened by the Earl of Scarbrough, Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire in 2001.

He soon became involved in the conflict before the Civil War known as Bleeding Kansas, when abolitionist and slavery forces battled to control the territory. During a confrontation with the pro-slavery territorial government in 1857, Blunt joined a force including Jim Lane and abolitionist John Brown.Collins, 2005, pp. 19-21 Blunt was a key member of the Wyandotte constitutional convention that framed the Kansas state constitution in 1859, and served as chair of the committee on militia.Collins, 2005, pp. 25-26 Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Blunt was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry, a part of James Lane's Kansas Brigade, an irregular partisan force not accepted into the Union Army until reorganized in April 1862.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964. . pp. 37-38.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p.135. In April 1862, Blunt was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and given command of the Department and Army of Kansas. He ordered Colonel William Weer to lead the \\"Indian Expedition\\" in 1861 which succeeded in occupying Fort Gibson and arming three regiments of Native Americans. Blunt's forces were defeated in the First Battle of Newtonia, and the Army of Kansas was incorporated into the Army of the Frontier as the 1st Division. Blunt led his division of Cherokee and Kansas volunteers to victory at the Battle of Old Fort Wayne. In December 1862, Blunt's division was joined by the 2nd Division under Francis J. Herron. The combined forces met Confederates under Thomas C. Hindman at the Battle of Prairie Grove. While tactically a draw, the battle was a strategic victory for the Union. Blunt was appointed major general of volunteers on March 16, 1863.Warner, Ezra, Generals in Blue, LSU Press, 2002, page 38 He was the only officer from Kansas to achieve that rank during the war.Collins, Robert, General James G. Blunt: Tarnished Glory, Pelican Publishing, 2005, page 11 He established Fort Baxter (also known as Fort Blair) in May 1863 near Baxter Springs, Kansas. Blunt was appointed to command the District of the Frontier. He campaigned for control of the Indian Territory and won a victory at the Battle of Honey Springs, bringing much of the Indian Territory into Union control. In October 1863, while moving his headquarters from Fort Scott to Fort Smith, Blunt and his detachment were attacked by a Confederate force under William C. Quantrill. At the Battle of Baxter Springs Quantrill's Raiders routed and killed over 80 of Blunt's 100 escorts, including his adjutant Major Henry Curtis, son of Major General Samuel Curtis. These actions led to Blunt's removal from command of the District of the Frontier. In 1864, Blunt was able to redeem himself. Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price began an invasion of Missouri and Blunt took command of the 1st Division of Army of the Border. He and the cavalry under Alfred Pleasonton fought delaying actions until Samuel R. Curtis brought the full strength of the army together and inflicted a defeat on Price at the Battle of Westport. Blunt's division inflicted the final defeat to Price at the Second Battle of Newtonia. Blunt commanded the District of South Kansas when the war ended. Post-war life and death James G. Blunt in a post-war portrait After the war, Blunt settled with his family in Leavenworth, Kansas and resumed his medical practice; he also was admitted to the Kansas bar as a lawyer. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1869 where he practiced his new profession.Collins, 2005, p. 218 In 1873, Blunt was accused by the Department of Justice of conspiracy to defraud the government and a body of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina. Earlier he had been cited in the 41st Congress's investigation of the Department of Indian Affairs, for charging Western tribes exorbitant (40% to 50%) lobbying fees for payments due them. Blunt's behaviour became erratic in 1879 when he was 53, and he was committed to an asylum. He died two years later, with the cause of death given as \\"softening of the brain.\\" His body was returned to Leavenworth and is buried in the Mount Muncie Cemetery.Collins, 2005, pp. 220-222 In popular culture James Blunt features briefly in Rifles for Watie, a novel by Harold Keith about a young Union soldier from Kansas fighting the Civil War in Indian Territory and the surrounding states. It includes a description of the Battle of Prairie Grove.

It is largely based on the conversion of fibre into yarn, yarn into fabric. These are then dyed or printed, fabricated into clothes which are then converted into useful goods such as clothing, household items, upholstery and various industrial products. Different types of fibres are used to produce yarn. Cotton remains the most important natural fibre, so is treated in depth. There are many variable processes available at the spinning and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the finishing and colouration processes to the production of a wide range of products. History Processing of cotton Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre. In the year 2007, the global yield was 25 million tons from 35 million hectares cultivated in more than 50 countries. There are six stages: * Cultivating and Harvesting * Preparatory Processes * Spinning * Weaving or Knitting * Finishing * Marketing =Cultivating and harvesting= Cotton is grown anywhere with long, hot dry summers with plenty of sunshine and low humidity. Indian cotton, Gossypium arboreum, is finer but the staple is only suitable for hand processing. American cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, produces the longer staple needed for machine production. Planting is from September to mid-November and the crop is harvested between March and June. The cotton bolls are harvested by stripper harvesters and spindle pickers that remove the entire boll from the plant. The cotton boll is the seed pod of the cotton plant; attached to each of the thousands of seeds are fibres about 2.5 cm long. *Ginning ::The seed cotton goes into a cotton gin. The cotton gin separates seeds and removes the \\"trash\\" (dirt, stems and leaves) from the fibre. In a saw gin, circular saws grab the fibre and pull it through a grating that is too narrow for the seeds to pass. A roller gin is used with longer staple cotton. Here, a leather roller captures the cotton. A knife blade, set close to the roller, detaches the seeds by drawing them through teeth in circular saws and revolving brushes which clean them away. The ginned cotton fibre, known as lint, is then compressed into bales which are about 1.5 m tall and weigh almost 220 kg. Only 33% of the crop is usable lint. Commercial cotton is priced by quality, and that broadly relates to the average length of the staple and the variety of the plant. Longer staple cotton (2¬Ω in to 1¬º in) is called Egyptian, medium staple (1¬º in to ¬æ in) is called American upland, and short staple (less than ¬æ in) is called Indian. The cotton seed is pressed into a cooking oil. The husks and meal are processed into animal feed, and the stems into paper. =Preparatory processes ‚Äì preparation of yarn= *Ginning, bale-making and transportation is done in the country of origin. *Opening and cleaning Platt Bros. Picker ::Cotton is shipped to mills in large 500-pound bales. When the cotton comes out of a bale, it is all packed together and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes, called an opener. To fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker or a similar machine. In a picker, the cotton is beaten with a beater bar to loosen it up. It is then fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap. *Blending, Mixing and Scutching Scutching refers to the process of cleaning cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber. *Carding Carding machine A Combing machine :In the carding process, the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow). The cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver: a large rope of fibres. :Note: In a wider sense carding can refer to these four processes: Willowing- loosening the fibres; Lapping- removing the dust to create a flat sheet or lap of cotton; Carding- combing the tangled lap into a thick rope of 1/2 inch in diameter, a sliver; and Drawing- where a drawing frame combines 4 slivers into one, repeated for increased quality. *Combing is optional, but is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn. *Drawing the fibres are straightened ::Several slivers are combined. Each sliver will have thin and thick spots, and by combining several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. Since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres, directly after being combined the slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process. ::Generally speaking, for machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. ::*Drawing frame: Draws the strand out ::*Slubbing Frame: adds twist, and winds onto bobbins ::*Intermediate Frames: are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn. ::*Roving frames: reduces to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube. =Spinning ‚Äì yarn manufacture= *Spinning ::Most spinning today is done using Break or Open-end spinning, this is a technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces. This method has replaced the older methods of ring and mule spinning. It is also easily adapted for artificial fibres. ::The spinning machines takes the roving, thins it and twists it, creating yarn which it winds onto a bobbin. ::In mule spinning the roving is pulled off a bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several different speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause a break in the yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a \\"cop\\", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled ring spinning. ::*The mule was an intermittent process, as the frame advanced and returned a distance of 5ft. It was the descendant of 1779 Crompton device. It produces a softer less twisted thread that was favoured for fines and for weft. ::*The ring was a descendant of the Arkwright Water frame 1769. It was a continuous process, the yarn was coarser, had a greater twist and was stronger so was suited to be warp. Ring spinning is slow due to the distance the thread must pass around the ring, other methods have been introduced. ::Sewing thread, was made of several threads twisted together, or doubled. *Checking ::This is the process where each of the bobbins is rewound to give a tighter bobbin. *Folding and twisting ::Plying is done by pulling yarn from two or more bobbins and twisting it together, in the opposite direction that in which it was spun. Depending on the weight desired, the cotton may or may not be plied, and the number of strands twisted together varies. *Gassing :: Gassing is the process of passing yarn, as distinct from fabric very rapidly through a series of Bunsen gas flames in a gassing frame, to burn off the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There is a loss of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.

This is coarser than 40 count cotton where 40x840 yards are needed. In the United Kingdom, Counts to 40s are coarse (Oldham Counts), 40 to 80s are medium counts and above 80 is a fine count. In the United States ones to 20s are coarse counts. *Hank: A length of 7 leas or 840 yards (the worsted hank is only 560 yd) *Thread: A length of 54 in (the circumference of a warp beam) *Bundle: Usually 10 lb *Lea: A length of 80 threads or 120 yards *Denier: this is an alternative method. It is defined as a number that is equivalent to the weight in grams of 9000m of a single yarn. 15 denier is finer than 30 denier. *Tex: is the weight in grams of 1 km of yarn. =Weaving-fabric manufacture= The weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads are known as the warp, and the cross way threads are known as the weft. The warp, which must be strong, needs to be presented to loom on a warp beam. The weft passes across the loom in a shuttle, that carries the yarn on a pirn. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence. *Winding ::After being spun and plied, the cotton thread is taken to a warping room where the winding machine takes the required length of yarn and winds it onto warpers bobbins *Warping or beaming A Warper ::Racks of bobbins are set up to hold the thread while it is rolled onto the warp bar of a loom. Because the thread is fine, often three of these would be combined to get the desired thread count. *Sizing ::Slasher sizing machine needed for strengthening the warp by adding starch to reduce breakage of the yarns. *Drawing in, Looming ::The process of drawing each end of the warp separately through the dents of the reed and the eyes of the healds, in the order indicated by the draft. *Pirning (Processing the weft) ::Pirn winding frame was used to transfer the weft from cheeses of yarn onto the pirns that would fit into the shuttle *Weaving ::At this point, the thread is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage anywhere from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked for such things as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker. ::: A Draper loom in textile museum, Lowell, Massachusetts :::The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up. ::::*Shedding: The operation of dividing the warp into two lines, so that the shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds-\\"open\\" and \\"closed.\\" Open Shed-The warp threads are moved when the pattern requires it-from one line to the other. Closed Shed-The warp threads are all placed level in one line after each pick. ::::*Picking:The operation of projecting the shuttle from side to side of the loom through the division in the warp threads. This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best for heavy or slow looms. ::::*Beating-up: The third primary movement of the loom when making cloth, and is the action of the reed as it drives each pick of weft to the fell of the cloth. ::: The Lancashire Loom was the first semi- automatic loom. Jacquard looms and Dobby looms are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A Northrop Loom was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet looms and rapier looms. Measurements * Ends and Picks: Picks refer to the weft, ends refer to the warp. The coarseness of the cloth can be expressed as the number of picks and ends per quarter-inch square, or per inch square. Ends is always written first. For example: Heavy domestics are made from coarse yarns, such as 10's to 14's warp and weft, and about 48 ends and 52 picks. Associated job titles *Piecer *Scavenger *Weaver *Tackler *Draw boy Issues When a hand loom was located in the home, children helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to help their older sisters, and laws have to be made to prevent child labour becoming established. =Knitting ‚Äì fabric manufacture= A circular knitting machine. Close-up on the needles. Knitting by machine is done in two different ways; warp and weft. Weft knitting (as seen in the pictures) is similar in method to hand knitting with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of yarn or multiple spools depending on the size of the machine cylinder (where the needles are bedded). In a warp knit there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the cotton yarn. Warp knits do not stretch as much as a weft knit, and it is run- resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but stretches more. This is especially true if spools of spandex are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more flexibility and making it less prone to having a 'baggy' appearance. The average t-shirt is a weft knit. =Finishing ‚Äì processing of textiles= Main article: Finishing (textiles) Finishing is a broad range of physical and chemical processes/treatments that complete one stage of textile manufacturing and may be preparing for the next step. And makes the product more receptive to the next stage of manufacturing. Finishing adds value to the product and makes it more attractive, useful and functional for the end-user. Improving surface feel, aesthetics and addition of advanced chemical finishes are some examples of textile finishing. The woven cotton fabric in its loom- state not only contains impurities, including warp size, but requires further treatment to develop its full textile potential. Furthermore, it may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes. *Desizing ::Depending on the size that has been used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes may be used to break down the size. *Scouring ::Scouring, is a chemical washing process carried out on cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and is considered to be a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required. *Bleaching ::Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential. *Mercerising ::A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with caustic soda solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching. ::Many other chemical treatments may be applied to cotton fabrics to produce low flammability, crease resist and other special effects but four important non-chemical finishing treatments are: *Singeing ::Singeing is designed to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce smoothness. The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames. *Raising ::Another finishing process is raising. During raising, the fabric surface is treated with sharp teeth to lift the surface fibres, thereby imparting hairiness, softness and warmth, as in flannelette. *Calendering ::Calendering is the third important mechanical process, in which the fabric is passed between heated rollers to generate smooth, polished or embossed effects depending on roller surface properties and relative speeds. *Shrinking (Sanforizing) ::Finally, mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal. *Dyeing ::Finally, cotton is an absorbent fibre which responds readily to colouration processes. Dyeing, for instance, is commonly carried out with an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. For improved fastness to washing, rubbing and light, other dyes such as vats and reactives are commonly used. These require more complex chemistry during processing and are thus more expensive to apply. *Printing ::Printing, on the other hand, is the application of colour in the form of a paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. It may be considered as localised dyeing. Printing designs onto already dyed fabric is also possible. =Economic, environmental and political consequences of cotton manufacture= Production of cotton requires arable land. In addition, cotton is farmed intensively and uses large amounts of fertilizer and 25% of the world's insecticides. Native Indian varieties of cotton were rainwater fed, but modern hybrids used for the mills need irrigation, which spreads pests. The 5% of cotton-bearing land in India uses 55% of all pesticides used in India. The consumption of energy in form of water and electricity is relatively high, especially in processes like washing, de-sizing, bleaching, rinsing, dyeing, printing, coating and finishing. Processing is time consuming. The major portion of water in textile industry is used for wet processing of textile (70 per cent). Approximately 25 per cent of energy in the total textile production like fibre production, spinning, twisting, weaving, knitting, clothing manufacturing etc. is used in dyeing. About 34 per cent of energy is consumed in spinning, 23 per cent in weaving, 38 per cent in chemical wet processing and five per cent in miscellaneous processes. Power dominates consumption pattern in spinning and weaving, while thermal energy is the major factor for chemical wet processing. Cotton acts as a carbon sink as it contains cellulose and this contains 44.44% carbon. However, due to carbon emissions from fertiliser application, use of mechanized tools to harvest the cotton, ... cotton manufacture tends to emit more CO2 than what it stores in the form of cellulose.Cutting cotton carbon emissions -Findings from Warangal, India The growth of cotton is divided into two segments i.e. organic and genetically modified. Cotton crop provides livelihood to millions of people but its production is becoming expensive because of high water consumption, use of expensive pesticides, insecticides and fertiliser. Genetically modified products aim to increase disease resistance and reduce the water required. The organic sector was worth $583 million. Genetically modified cotton, in 2007, occupied 43% of cotton growing areas. Before mechanisation, cotton was harvested manually by farmers in India and by African slaves in America. In 2012 Uzbekistan was a major exporter of cotton and uses manual labour during the harvest. Human rights groups claim that health care professionals and children are forced to pick cotton.Doctors and nurses are forced to pick cotton Processing of other vegetable fibres =Flax= Flax is a bast fibre, which means it comes in bundles under the bark of the Linum usitatissimum plant. The plant flowers and is harvested. :*Retting :*Breaking :*Scutching :*Hackling or combing It is now treated like cotton. =Jute= Jute is a bast fibre, which comes from the inner bark of the plants of the Corchorus genus. It is retted like flax, sundried and baled. When spinning a small amount of oil must be added to the fibre. It can be bleached and dyed. It was used for sacks and bags but is now used for the backing for carpets. Jute can be blended with other fibres to make composite fabrics and work continues in Bangladesh to refine the processes and extend the range of usage possible. In the 1970s, jute-cotton composite fabrics were known as jutton fabrics.Daily Star Magazine 1 October 2003, accessed 20 May 2010 =Hemp= Hemp is a bast fibre from the inner bark of Cannabis sativa. It is difficult to bleach, and is used for making cord and rope. :*Retting :*Separating :*Pounding =Other bast fibres= These bast fibres can also be used: kenaf, urena, ramie, nettle. =Other leaf fibres= Sisal is the main leaf fibre used; others are: abac√° and henequen. Processing of wool and silk =Wool= Traditional spinner in her family's house in Old Bagan, Myanmar (2019). Wool comes from domesticated sheep. It forms two products, woolens and worsteds. The sheep has two sorts of wool and it is the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been recovered from rags. Shoddy is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics. The fleece is cut in one piece from the sheep. This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. It is graded into long wool where the fibres can be up to 15 in, but anything over 2.5 inches is suitable for combing into worsteds. Fibres less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or carding wool. At the mill the wool is scoured in a detergent to remove grease (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically in the opening machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using sulphuric acid (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and sodium carbonate. The wool is oiled before carding or combing. :*Woollens: Use noils from the worsted combs, mungo and shoddy and new short wool :*Worsteds :::Combing: Oiled slivers are wound into laps, and placed in the circular comber. The worsted yarn gathers together to form a top. The shorter fibres or noils remain behind and are removed with a knife. :*Angora =Silk= The processes in silk production are similar to those of cotton but take account that reeled silk is a continuous fibre. The terms used are different. *Opening bales. Assorting skeins: where silk is sorted by colour, size and quality, scouring: where the silk is washed in water of 40 degrees for 12 hours to remove the natural gum, drying: either by steam heating or centrifuge, softening: by rubbing to remove any remaining hard spots. *Silk throwing (winding). The skeins are placed on a reel in a frame with many others. The silk is wound onto spools or bobbins. :*Doubling and twisting. The silk is far too fine to be woven, so now it is doubled and twisted to make the warp, known as organzine and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with each other with a light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'. :*Stretching. The thread is tested for consistent size. Any uneven thickness is stretched out. The resulting thread is reeled into containing 500 yd to 2500 yd. The skeins are about 50 inches in loop length. :*Dyeing: the skeins are scoured again, and discoloration removed with a sulphur process. This weakens the silk. The skeins are now tinted or dyed. They are dried and rewound onto bobbins, spools and skeins. Looming, and the weaving process on power looms is the same as with cotton. *Weaving. The organzine is now warped. This is a similar process to in cotton. Firstly, thirty threads or so are wound onto a warping reel, and then using the warping reels, the threads are beamed. A thick layer of paper is laid between each layer on the beam to stop entangling. =Environmental consequences of wool and silk manufacture= Both wool and silk require farmland. Whereas silkworms require mulberry leaves, sheep eat grass, clover, forbs and other pasture plants. Sheep, like all ruminants emit CO2 via their digestive system.MEASUREMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION IN SHEEP BY ISOTOPE DILUTION. Also, their pastures may sometimes be fertilisedUse of nitrogen fertiliser to boost winter pasture growth which further increases emissions. =Synthetic fibres= Synthetic fibres are the result of extensive development by scientists to improve upon the naturally occurring animal and plant fibres. In general, synthetic fibres are created by forcing, or extruding, fibre forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, thus forming a thread. Before synthetic fibres were developed, cellulose fibres were made from natural cellulose, which comes from plants. The first artificial fibre, known as art silk from 1799 onwards, became known as viscose around 1894, and finally rayon in 1924. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibres, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Although these artificial fibres were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s. Nylon, the first synthetic fibre, made its debut in the United States as a replacement for silk, and was used for parachutes and other military uses. The techniques used to process these fibres in yarn are essentially the same as with natural fibres, modifications have to be made as these fibres are of great length, and have no texture such as the scales in cotton and wool that aid meshing. Unlike natural fibres, produced by plants, animals or insects, synthetic fibres are made from fossil fuels, and thus require no farmland.Do Synthetic Fabrics Harm the Environment See also * Clothing technology * Wet processing engineering * Spinning (textiles) * Dref Friction Spinning * Fashion design * Textile from algae * Glossary of textile manufacturing * Textile design * Textile manufacture during the British Industrial Revolution *Textile manufacturing by pre-industrial methods * Timeline of clothing and textiles technology References Bibliography   * External links *Cotton Year Book 1910 (Textile Mercury) Descriptions and calculations for purchasing all cotton processing machines. *1921 John Hetherington & Sons Catalogue Descriptions and illustrations of principal machines. * Category:Textile industry ","title":"Textile manufacturing"},{"id":"2162740","text":"\\"Mary Hamilton\\", or \\"The Fower Maries\\" (\\"The Four Marys\\"), is a common name for a well-known sixteenth-century ballad from Scotland based on an apparently fictional incident about a lady-in-waiting to a Queen of Scotland. It is Child Ballad 173 and Roud 79. In all versions of the song, Mary Hamilton is a personal attendant to the Queen of Scots, but precisely which queen is not specified. She becomes pregnant by the Queen's husband, the King of Scots, which results in the birth of a baby. Mary kills the infant ‚Äì in some versions by casting it out to sea or drowning, and in others by exposure. The crime is seen and she is convicted. The ballad recounts Mary's thoughts about her life and her impending death in a first-person narrative. Versions of the ballad have been recorded by a number of artists, including Joan Baez, The Corries, and Angelo Branduardi. Sources of the ballad Illustration by Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale: She had Mary Seaton, and Mary Beaton, And Mary Carmichael, and me Most versions of the song are set in Edinburgh, but Joan Baez set her version, possibly the best known, in Glasgow, ending with these words: :: Last night there were four Maries; :: Tonight there'll be but three: :: There was Mary Beaton and Mary Seton :: And Mary Carmichael and me. This verse suggests Mary Hamilton was one of the famous Four Maries, four girls named Mary who were chosen by the queen mother and regent Mary of Guise to be companion ladies-in-waiting to her daughter, the child monarch Mary, Queen of Scots. However their names were Mary Seton, Mary Beaton, Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston. Mary Stuart could not be a real life source for the ballad in any of its current forms as these are in conflict with the historical record. She and the Four Maries lived in France from 1547 to 1560, where Mary was dauphine and then queen as the wife of King Francis II. Mary later returned home to Scotland (keeping the French spelling of her surname, Stuart). She married her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in July 1565, and he was murdered 20 months later. So there was not much time for Darnley to have got one of the four Maries (or any other mistress) pregnant, and there is no record of him having done so. Also the song refers to \\"the highest Stuart of all\\" ‚Äì which between 1542 and 1567 was a woman not a man.E. Henry David Music Publishers, The Four Marys . Retrieved 14 February 2012. The ballad could contain echoes of James IV or James V, who both had several illegitimate children, but none of their mistresses were executed or tried to dispose of a baby. =Mary Hamilton in Russia= The story may have been transferred from a wholly different context. It has been noted that it most closely matches, rather than any event in Scotland, the legend of Maria Danilova Gamentova, daughter of an expatriate branch of the Clan Hamilton established in Russia by Thomas Hamilton during the reign of Tsar Ivan IV (1547‚Äì1584). A lady in waiting to Tsarina Catherine, second wife of Tsar Peter I \\"The Great\\" (who later succeeded him as Catherine I), Mary Hamilton was also the Tsar's mistress. She bore a child in 1717, who may have been fathered by the Tsar but whom she admitted drowning shortly after its birth. She also stole trinkets from the Tsarina to present them to her lover Ivan Orlov. For the murder of her child, she was beheaded in 1719. Mary's head was preserved and displayed in the Kunstkamera, a palace holding natural and scientific \\"curiosities\\". At that time, Charles Wogan was in Russia on a mission for James Francis Edward Stuart, and through him news of the incident might have reached Scotland.Andrew Lang. The Valet‚Äôs Tragedy and Other Stories, online- literature.com. In many versions of the song, the queen is called \\"the auld Queen\\". This would normally indicate a Queen Dowager or Queen Mother, but in this context suggests a queen consort who was an older woman, and married to a king of comparable age. If the reference is limited to Queens named Mary, another candidate would be Mary of Guelders (1434‚Äì1463), queen to James II, King of Scots.  Field Recordings  Dozens of traditional versions of the ballad have been recorded. James Madison Carpenter recorded several versions in Scotland in the early 1930s, which can be heard online via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library. Peter Kennedy recorded two Scottish versions in the mid-1950s, sung by Jeannie Robertson of Aberdeen and Ethel Findlater of Dounby, Orkney, and another version sung by Mary Taylor of Saxby-All-Saints, Lincolnshire, England. Fred Hamer recorded Fred Jordan of Ludlow, Shropshire singing 'The Four Marys' in 1966. The song made its way to the United States, where Alan Lomax recorded Texas Gladden of Virginia singing a version in 1941, and traditional singer Almeda Riddle of Arkansas performed a version in 1972. Jean Ritchie and her sister Edna were filmed in their hometown of Viper, Kentucky performing a rendition passed down through their family. Many versions have also been found in Canada, including several recorded by Helen Creighton in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario.  \\"Mary Hamilton\\" in A Room of One's Own  Mary Hamilton Before Execution, St. Petersburg by Pavel Svedomskiy, 1904 In her highly influential text A Room of One's Own, author Virginia Woolf alludes to the characters in the ballad. She refers by name to Mary Beton, Mary Seton, and Mary Carmichael as recurrent personae, leaving only Mary Hamilton, the narrator of the ballad, unmentioned. Mary Beton plays the prominent role in Woolf's extended essay, as she serves as the speaker. According to her narrator in A Room of One's Own, \\"'I' is only a convenient term for somebody who has no real being.\\" A few sentences later, the narrator returns to the concept of identity and subjectivity and invokes the subjects of the ballad for the first time: \\"Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please ‚Äì it is not a matter of importance)...\\"Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own (Annotated). 1929. Reprint. New York: Harvest Books, 2005. Print. 4‚Äì5. Mary Beton serves as the narrator throughout A Room of One's Own. The six chapters of the essay follow Mary Beton's walks through Oxbridge grounds and London streets, and her mental explorations of the history of women and fiction. The name reappears in the character of the narrator's aunt, who serves as both the namesake and benefactor of Mary Beton.Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own (Annotated). 1929. Reprint. New York: Harvest Books, 2005. Print. 37. Woolf is able to detach herself from the narrative voice of the essay through the use of Beton. Mary Seton is a friend of Mary Beton at the fictitious Fernham College (modelled after Cambridge's Newnham and Girton Colleges). It is partially through her conversations with Seton that Beton raises questions about the relationship between financial wealth and the opportunities for female education. Speaking of Mary Seton's mother, the narrator states, \\"If she had left two or three hundred thousand pounds to Fernham, we could have been sitting at our ease tonight and the subject of our talk might have been archaeology, botany, anthropology, physics, the nature of the atom, mathematics, astronomy, relativity, geography.\\"Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own (Annotated). 1929. Reprint. New York: Harvest Books, 2005. Print. p.21. Mary Carmichael plays the role of a fictitious author referenced by the narrator in A Room of One's Own.Woolf, 1929. p.78. Her fabricated novel, Life's Adventure, allows Woolf to introduce the concept of female relationships. Mary Carmichael may also evoke the idea of the real author and birth-control activist Marie Carmichael (pseudonym for Marie Stopes) and her novel Love's Creation.

The open method rests on soft law mechanisms such as guidelines and indicators, benchmarking and sharing of best practice. This means that there are no official sanctions for laggards. Rather, the method's effectiveness relies on a form of peer pressure and naming and shaming, as no member state wants to be seen as the worst in a given policy area. The OMC works in stages. Firstly, the Council of Ministers agrees on (often very broad) policy goals. Secondly, Member states then transpose guidelines into national and regional policies. Thirdly, specific benchmarks and indicators to measure best practice are agreed upon. Finally, results are monitored and evaluated. However, the OMC differs significantly across the various policy areas to which it has been applied: there may be shorter or longer reporting periods, guidelines may be set at EU or member state level and enforcement mechanisms may be harder or softer. The OMC is more intergovernmental in nature than the traditional means of policy-making in the EU, the so-called community method. Because it is a decentralised approach through which agreed policies are largely implemented by the member states and supervised by the Council of the European Union, the involvement of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice is very weak indeed. Formally, at least, the European Commission has primarily a monitoring role; in practice, however, there is considerable scope for it to help set the policy agenda and persuade reluctant Member States to implement agreed policies. Although the OMC was devised as a tool in policy areas which remain the responsibility of national governments (and where the EU itself has no, or few, legislative powers) it is sometimes seen as a way for the Commission to \\"get a foot in the door\\" of a national policy area. The OMC was first applied in EU employment policy, as defined in the Amsterdam Treaty of 1997, although it was not called by this name at the time. It was officially named, defined and endorsed at the Lisbon Council for the realm of social policy. Since then it has been applied in the European employment strategy, social inclusion, pensions, consumer care, immigration, asylum, education and culture and research, and its use has also been suggested for health as well as environmental affairs. The OMC was also frequently debated in the European Convention. Historically, the OMC can be seen as a reaction to the EU's economic integration in the 1990s. This process reduced the member states' options in the field of employment policy. But they were also weary of delegating more powers to the European institutions and thus designed the OMC as an alternative to the existing EU modes of governance. In the following, the OMCs in the areas of employment and social protection will be analysed because they are usually considered the most developed ones. A brief introduction to the \\"upcoming\\" OMC in health is also given. However, bear in mind that the open method seems to become more and more widespread, including areas such as immigration and asylum which are not discussed here.  Development of the OMC: from EMU to the EES  EMU and in particular the Stability and Growth Pact as well as the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (which were introduced as an instrument to realise the goals set down in the Lisbon Agenda) can be considered a sort of ‚Äúproto-OMC‚Äù with comparatively hard sanctioning mechanisms. As a reaction to the economic integration of Europe, the European Employment strategy (EES) evolved in the 1990s with the rationale of rebalancing monetary and economic integration. The original EES thus consisted in more or less replicating the EMU process with mid-term objectives, indicators and pressure for convergence. Legitimised through the Amsterdam treaty, the EES then became a process in its own right. As mentioned above, its principles were generalized and christened ‚ÄúOpen Method of Coordination‚Äù at the Lisbon Summit (2000). Finally, the third phase of the EES began with the five year review in 2003 where the EES was repoliticised, due to the growing dominance of right wing governments in the EU. Nowadays the EES is a political compromise aimed to exclude both pure neo- liberal and social democratic approaches.  The OMC in social inclusion  The social inclusion OMC, by contrast, was not directly linked to the EMU debate. Social inclusion was for many years a controversial topic to address at the European level due to the subsidiarity concept. In 1999 the Commission finally adopted a communication for a concerted strategy on social protection, proposing a Social Protection Committee which was made official in the Nice Treaty. Said committee was responsible for the initial standard setting exercise. Next, each member state was asked to benchmark its situation by producing a two year national action plan (NAP or NAPincl), presenting national-level strategies for improving the situation. These were made available in June 2001. 18 months later the EU released a joint report on social inclusion where the member state‚Äôs approaches were compared and contrasted and recommendations were given. While the NAPs form a first level of action, the Community Action Programme to combat poverty and social exclusion, which aims to improve cooperation between the member states, can be considered the second level of action. In the social inclusion OMC some funds were made available for NGOs and consequently its \\"inclusive\\" approach to civil society has been favourably commented upon. However, this is not necessarily the case for other OMCs. According to FEANTSA (2005), the Pensions OMC is more closed and involves mainly the Commission and national civil servants.  Comparing the employment and social inclusion OMC  When comparing the EES and social inclusion OMC, Pochet (2005: 43) notes that the first seems to go more in a direction of centralization, naming and shaming without any broad discussion about the content on the European level (top- down). The second process goes more towards an experimental dynamic with the involvement of local and regional actors (bottom-up). However, the author also notes that this is probably an over-generalization with tensions between centralization and decentralization being present in both forms. Due to their different nature the impact of those two OMCs can be quite diverse as well. Ferrera and Sacchi (2004) analyse the impact of the EES and the Social Inclusion OMC in Italy. They conclude that the autonomous impact of the OMC has been relatively significant in the case of employment and relatively insignificant in the case of social inclusion. One key difference was the treaty status of the employment OMC which forced the Italian authorities to comply - this component was lacking for social inclusion. Furthermore, the issue of unemployment and labour market reform was simply more salient than social inclusion.  Health  As member states increasingly face common concerns in healthcare (such as demographic ageing), the application of the OMC has been discussed. In March 2004 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of the OMC in health and long term care. The April 2004 Communication by the Commission recommended to apply the OMC to the development and modernization of health care provision and funding. As potential advantages the Commission pointed to: * greater consistency with existing social protection mechanism * closer coordination with other political processes such as the EES (in particular regard to the ageing workforce), As a result, the issues of health should better reflect the Lisbon strategy * involving the many actors in the sectors, particularly the social partners, the health care profession and patient representatives Further steps have been taken to start the introduction of the OMC.  Indicators and streamlining  The choice of indicators is of vital consequence for the OMC and critics have argued that, for instance in the Social Protection OMC, the quality of the indicators is not high enough or oriented too much on economic criteria and not social ones. Also, for health the comparability of national data has been doubted. In the social protection field the Commission is preparing to streamline the methods used in the different OMCs (social inclusion, pensions etc.). In this context, critics fear that the number of indicators will be too much reduced.

In most contexts, it refers to policies and legislation that aim to abolish or curb parole so that convicts serve the period to which they have been sentenced. Truth in sentencing advocates relate such policies in terms of the public's right to know; they argue, for example, that it is deceptive to sentence an individual to \\"seven to nine years\\" and then release the individual after he or she has served only six years. In some cases, truth in sentencing is linked to other movements such as mandatory sentencing (in which particular crimes yield automatic sentences regardless of the extenuating circumstances) and habitual offender or \\"three strikes\\" laws in which state law requires the state courts to hand down mandatory and extended periods of incarceration to persons who have been convicted of a criminal offense on multiple occasions. Canada In Canada, the Truth in Sentencing act, or Bill C-25http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?Language=E&ls;=c25&source;=library_prb&Parl;=40&Ses;=2 came into effect on Monday, February 22, 2010.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/02/23/nicholson-truth- sentencing.html This bill amends s.719 of the Criminal Code of Canada, limiting the discretion of a sentencing judges to give credit to individuals who have spent time incarcerated prior to conviction. Until then, as discussed by Justice Arbour in R v. Wust,http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc18/2000scc18.html, [2000] S.C.R. 455 credit for pre-sentencing custody was not determined by a 'mathematical formula', but many judges frequently granted a two-for-one credit. That is justified by the quantitative and qualitative differences between pre-and post-sentencing incarceration. Most individuals who are incarcerated will not serve the full length of their sentence, and because time spent incarcerated pre-sentence does not count towards remission time, if a lengthy pre-sentence incarceration is credited equally to post-sentencing incarceration, the convicted individual will serve a longer sentence compared to an individual who is given the same sentence without a lengthy period of pre-sentencing incarceration. Arbour also points out that pre-sentence incarceration is typically served in detention, in harsher circumstances than the sentence will ultimately call for and without access to educational, rehabilitative and vocational programs. Bill C-25 creates three changes in the Criminal Code;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/C-46.pdf now under s.719(3), generally the maximum credit a judge can give is 1:1. Under s.719(3.1) and 719(3.2) a judge can give a credit of 1.5:1 only \\"if the circumstances justify it.\\" Under s.719(3.1), the sentencing judge cannot give greater than 1:1 credit if the reason for pre-sentencing incarceration is either that person's criminal record or if that individual has breached bail conditions. The constitutionality of this bill was challenged under s.7, s.13 and s.15 of The Charter in the Ontario Court of Justice by Marvin Johnson.http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2011/2011oncj77/2011oncj77.html, R v. Johnson 2011 ONCJ 77 The court found that the amendment survivor Charter scrutiny if the phrase if the circumstances justify it is interpreted in a manner that does not limit the granting of a 1.5:1 credit to such a high standard \\"that mandates a level of exceptionality that goes well beyond the ordinary experience of \\"dead time\\" or the penal disparities that typically flow from such pre-sentence custody.\\" In this case, Johnson who was sentenced to 18 months for the sale of $20 of cocaine to an undercover officer, was given a 1.5:1 credit for the 12 months that he had spent in pre-sentence custody and was released two days after his sentencing hearing to a one year period of probation. United States The first law requiring truth in sentencing in the United States was passed by Washington State in 1984. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act created the Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing program, which awarded grants to states so long as they passed laws requiring that offenders convicted of Part 1 violent crimes must serve at least 85% of the sentence for qualifying crimes before becoming eligible for parole. As of 2008, the District of Columbia and 35 of the 50 states qualify for this additional funding. Australia In New South Wales, \\"truth in sentencing\\" was brought in with the '1989 Sentencing Act'. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, since the enactment of the legislation, life imprisonment \\"has meant life\\". The term \\"truth in sentencing\\", which was commonly used to refer to the legislation, was endorsed by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The first murderer to be sentenced under the legislation was Matthew Webster, who was convicted of the murder of Leigh Leigh. In 1990 Webster received 14 years with an additional six-year parole period; he remained in prison for 14¬Ω years. If he had received a 'life sentence' under the previous legislation, it is likely that he would have only served nine years due to his age.

Life He was a son of Sir Robert Wotton of Boughton Malherbe, Kent, and a descendant of Sir Nicholas Wotton, Lord Mayor of London in 1415 and 1430, who was Member of Parliament for the City from 1406 to 1429. Soon after ordination Wotton was granted the benefices of Boughton Malherbe and of Sutton Valence, and later of Ivychurch, Kent. Desirous of a more worldly career, he entered the service of Prince-Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall, then Bishop of London. Having helped to draw up the Institution of a Christian Man, Wotton in 1539 went to arrange the marriage between Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves and the union of Protestant princes which was to be the complement of this union. Wotton crossed over to England with the new royal bride but, unlike Thomas Cromwell, he did not lose the royal favour when the king repudiated Anne. In 1541, having already refused the bishopric of Hereford, he became the first post-Reformation dean of Canterbury and in 1544 dean of York. In 1543 he went on diplomatic business to the Netherlands, and for the next year or two he had much intercourse with the Emperor Charles V He helped to conclude the Treaty of Ardres between England and France in 1546, and was Ambassador resident in France from 1546 to 1549. Henry VIII made Wotton an executor of his Will and left him ¬£300, and in October 1549, under Edward VI the post of Minister of State lay vacant; he held the post for about a year until succeeded by the unimpeachable Protestant Sir William Cecil. In 1550 Wotton was again sent as Royal Envoy to the Holy Roman Emperor and as Ambassador to France during the reign of Mary, doing valuable work in that capacity securing the peace. He left France in 1557, but in 1558 he was again in that kingdom, helping to arrange the preliminaries of the Peace of Cateau Cambr√©sis. In 1560 he signed the Treaty of Edinburgh on behalf of Elizabeth I, and he had again visited the Netherlands before his death in London. He is buried in the Trinity Chapel of Canterbury Cathedral.www.british-history.ac.uk Relatives His brother Sir Edward Wotton was made Treasurer of Calais in 1540, and was one of those who took part in the overthrow of the Lord Protector Somerset.

The show was created by producer Michael E. Uslan, who considered it a \\"hairbrained idea\\". A total of 65 episodes were made for the show's first-run syndication, but it only lasted one season. There were originally plans by Galoob to release a Dinosaucers toyline, and prototype figures were produced; however, the line was scrapped after the show was canceled. The toys included Stego, Bronto-Thunder, Allo, Bonehead, Plesio, Quackpot, Ankylo, and Genghis Rex. In 2018, Uslan joined with publisher Lion Forge Comics to revive Dinosaucers as a comic book. Description The show follows the Dinosaucers and their battles against the evil Tyrannos. Each group is composed of intelligent anthropomorphic dinosaurs or other prehistoric saurian species. The Dinosaucers are also allied with four humans known as the Secret Scouts. The two groups originally come from a planet in a counter-Earth orbit known as Reptilon. Most of the characters are named after the type of prehistoric animal they are based on, or some pun of the name. Both groups have a central base of operations. The Dinosaucers' base is called Lava Dome and is located in a mountain area, in a dormant volcano. The Tyrannos' base is located under a tar pit. Each of the groups' members save for Teryx and Terrible Dactyl‚Äìwho can themselves fly‚Äìhave flying ships in which they can travel and do battle. Most ships actually resemble the personae of their respective owners. Along with their individual ships, both groups have a large mothership of sorts as well. =Dinovolving= All the Dinosaucers have a button on the front of their uniforms which instantly devolves them to their primitive ancestors dinosaur state, while retaining their intelligence and speech capacity. This special ability is called Dinovolving and initially appeared to be a significant element of the series, as both Allo and Bronto Thunder Dinovolved in the first episode. Despite the apparent technological advantage, most of the later episodes did not feature any Dinovolving. Teryx was the only Dinosaucer who would never Dinovolve throughout the series, while Allo, Tricero, Bonehead and Bronto Thunder would use the ability in more than one episode. The Tyrannos don't have the secret of Dinovolving, and a few episodes even revolve around their plans to steal the technology somehow. However, they do possess a special raygun called a devolver. Blasting a living creature with this weapon has the same \\"devolving\\" effect as Dinovolving, but reduces the victim's intelligence to that of the devolved form. For those from Reptilon the form is that of a normal dinosaur while humans get reverted to primitive cavemen. In any case, the device often winds up being used against them, to much comedic effect, rather than on the Dinosaucers. In this fashion, Genghis Rex, Ankylo, Quackpot and Brachio were all changed into primitive dinosaurs at various times in the series. The Tyrannos also possess a weapon called a \\"fossilizer\\", which is capable of turning its target into stone, as well as reversing the condition. The Dinosaucers were also shown to have access to this particular type of weapon in one episode, though it may have been on loan from the Tyrannos, as both factions had united to battle a group of anthropomorphic Sabertooth Tigers, who also hailed from Reptilon. These creatures possessed fossilizers as well, and also had a device which could disrupt the equivalent weapons belonging to the Dinosaucers and Tyrannos while leaving their own in perfect working order. Characters =Dinosaucers= *Allo is an evolved Allosaurus and the leader of the Dinosaucers. Allo is calm, collected and serious. He wears blue and teal armor, a teal helmet, and goes barefooted and has brown skin. He has a wife named Vera, a daughter named Alloetta and even a maid named Gatormaid (a play on Gatorade). He is the nephew of the Dinosorceror and Dinosorceress (rulers of Reptilon). His address on Reptilon is \\"where Palmer Avenue meets Emerson and Lake\\". He can Dinovolve into a 40-foot Allosaurus. *Dimetro is another member of the Dinosaucers and Allo's assistant. Dimetro is the scientist/mechanic of the group. He wears brown and red armor, a blue mask on his head, has aqua green skin and speaks with a slight Scottish accent. Dimetro is an evolved Dimetrodon, which is a basal synapsid or proto-mammal, rather than a dinosaur. He can Dinovolve into a large Dimetrodon. *Bronto Thunder is an evolved Apatosaurus, despite his name suggesting he's a Brontosaurus. Bronto Thunder has a girlfriend back on Reptilon named Apatty Saurus, and was a \\"rep\\" for a ceramic tile shop before he became a Dinosaucer. Bronto Thunder's name is an example of a tautology, as \\"bronto\\" means \\"thunder\\" in Ancient Greek. Physically considered the strongest of the Dinosaucers. He can Dinovolve into an 80-foot Apatosaurus. *Stego is an evolved Stegosaurus and a rather dim-witted recruit when compared to the rest of the team. He tries to be brave, but is prone to panic attacks and general cowardice. However he often manages to get through this and has come to the rescue of his friends, particularly in the episode Trouble in Paradise. Stego can pull his head inside his Dinosaucers' uniform, much like a turtle. Stego also has an armored space ship similar to his race of Stegosaurs. Stego is a very powerful hand-to-hand combatant who doesn't realize his own strength. He can Dinovolve into a 30-foot Stegosaurus, though he was never seen doing so in the series. *Tricero is an evolved Triceratops. He had a history for doing investigative work back on Reptilon, and provides a voice of calm reason. Tricero was a member of the law-enforcing Tricerocops on Reptilon before he became a Dinosaucer. Tricero has a vibrational super power that emanates from his 2 brow horns. He is a mortal enemy to Styraco. He can Dinovolve into a 30-foot Triceratops. *Bonehead is Allo's nephew and, as his name suggests, is not particularly bright. However, he sometimes does display intelligence though in a mostly literal way. He has a baby brother named Numbskull (Nummy). Mother Bonehilda is a famous scientist, and Allo's sister. Bonehead is an evolved Pachycephalosaurus. He is good natured and innocent, without a doubt the stupidest Dinosaucer, even though he has great combat ability as a Pachycephalosaurus. He can Dinovolve into a 25-foot Pachycephalosaurus. *Ichy, whose name is pronounced \\"Icky\\", is an evolved Ichthyosaurus, a prehistoric aquatic reptile. He has a pointed beak, a tail with fins or flukes, grey skin and wears green armor. He also wears dark green flippers on his feet, rather than boots. Ichy (and Plesio) can talk to sea creatures. Throughout the series, though oblivious at first of her mutuality, he forms a couple with Teryx since the episode For the Love of Teryx. This is heavily implied because since then his love is reciprocal and he becomes very distressed when Teryx is approached by Genghis Rex, who also possess feelings for her, though these are not corresponded. He can Dinovolve into a 30-foot Ichthyosaurus. *Teryx is the only female Dinosaucer. She is an evolved Archaeopteryx, which is a derived theropod dinosaur, considered to be the first \\"true\\" bird. She is therefore either half-bird, half-reptile or an avian reptile. She has white, blue, and salmon-colored plumage and unlike the other Dinosaucers, wears a simple backpack in lieu of armor. She can understand and talk to birds. Teryx has a crush on Ichy, but fears it won't work out because she is a flying creature, while Ichy is aquatic, though she comes around it and gains confidence in herself as the series progresses, even forming a pair with Ichy since the episode For the Love of Teryx. At the same time, Teryx completely denies Genghis Rex's advances. Despite doing so, she understands him and despite stating she has no feelings for Rex in the episode Scales of Justice, she does seem to feel pity towards him. However, her feminine charms have been used against Genghis Rex, since his affection for her prevents him from harming her or even plotting against the Dinosaucers at times. Teryx used to be an actress on Reptilon's daytime television before she became a Dinosaucer. She can Dinovolve into a large Archaeopteryx, though she is never shown doing so during the course of the series. Teryx was turned into a human during the episode Cindersaurus, as the group had developed a technology called the Dinotransformatter that would allow them to transform into humans‚Äî ironically created seemingly for sole the purpose of allowing Teryx to attend a masquerade ball with Sara due to her having developed an interest in human courting rituals‚Äî and briefly had an attraction to a human at Sara's school named Douglas. Returned to normal by the episode's end, the character has since had no romantic interest in humans and the plot point of the Dinosaucers having a technology that would allow them to take on human form was forgotten. Presumably, they still possess the device, but it has become a forgotten piece of their arsenal. This episode was aired after the episode For the Love of Teryx, but may take place before it chronologically, as Teryx did seem to have a genuine attraction to Douglas, something which would contradict the fact of her relationship with Ichy, established fifteen episodes prior, barring an off-screen breakup that may not have been mentioned. Alternatively, her attraction may have been caused by the alteration from Dinosaucer to human, though if this is so, it may have some lingering effect, as Teryx is shown at the end of the episode to still find the time spent with Douglas to be apparently a brief period of genuine romance. =Secret Scouts= The Secret Scouts are four teenage humans who help the Dinosaucers as allies. According to the opening credits they met them when they first arrived and gained powers through magic rings they were given. They are some of the closest friends the Dinosaucers have while they are on Earth. The Secret Scouts. (From left to right) Sara, Paul, Ryan and David *Ryan Spencer is a blond haired male teenager who is apparently the smartest and most athletic of the group; this, in the while, implies that he is the leader of the Scouts. He doesn't seem to get into as much trouble as his three friends do. He is Sara's older brother. *Sara Spencer is a blond haired female teenager and the only girl of the Scouts. She is quite athletic and informative, often teaching the Dinosaucers (albeit confusing to them) Earth-related notions. With her ring power, she can strongly boost her physical abilities a little more than that of an Olympic athlete, allowing her to jump at amazing heights, run faster, and be more agile. She has a pet cat named Missy. She often goes on adventures with Bronto Thunder and relates very well to the only female Dinosaucer, Teryx. She is Ryan's younger sister. *Paul (surname unknown/not given) is a brainy African- American male teenager who wears glasses. He seems to find the Dinosaucers thrilling and fun. He also has a pet dog named Charlie, who sometimes causes a lot of trouble for the Dinosaucers in various episodes. His Scout ring lets him run at enhanced speed over long distances. He generally spends a lot of time with Dimetro. *David (surname unknown/not given) is a black haired teenage male and the wild one of the Scouts. He often gets into trouble and making matters worse by getting the Dinosaucers involved in his \\"act-first and think-second\\" tactics. He is strong and athletic, and although he doesn't quite have the sharp intellect of Paul or Ryan, he is creative and a quick thinker. He is often involved with various adventures with Stego and Bonehead. His ring can increase his strength allowing him to lift objects weighing several hundred pounds. =Tyrannos= The Evil Tyrannos. (From left to right) Styraco, Plesio, Genghis Rex, Quackpot, Brachio, Ankylo and Terrible Dactyl The Tyrannos are the forces of \\"evil\\" in the series and, like the Dinosaucers, have a total of 8 members in their group. The picture above does not show Princess Dei, as she does not appear at the presentation of the series and is only introduced later as a means to balance the difference in numbers and power of the two opposing factions. During the course of the series, Plesio, Terrible Dactyl and Quackpot would all betray Genghis Rex at least once over matters of conscience. Nevertheless, they would eventually return to Rex's side out of loyalty to his cause. *Genghis Rex, usually referred to as simply \\"Rex\\", is the leader of the Tyrannos, as well as Allo's evil counterpart. He is an evolved Tyrannosaurus, has red skin and wears orange, blue armor and goes barefooted. His first name is based on Genghis Khan the famous Mongol. Living up to his species' reputation, he is brutal and tyrannical, and has a violent temper. He appears in every episode except for episode 13 (Trick or Cheat) and episode 59 (The Babysitter), in which Quackpot was the sole Tyranno to appear, and episode 35 (Fine-Feathered Friends) and episode 51 (Dinosaur Dundy), in which none of the Tyrannos appear. Typically, Rex will insult his compatriots with plays on dinosaur words or names, such as idiot-tops or tail- for-brains, whenever things do not go according to his plans. In exchange, Rex endures being called many flattering and important sounding names by the other Tyrannos, such as Bossasaur and Your Scaliness. A running gag throughout the series is that Rex strongly objects to the use of the term Chiefasaur when addressing him (a reference to the \\"don't call me 'Chief'\\" running gag of Perry White from the 50s Superman show). As a villain, he tends to be staggeringly inept, always losing to the Dinosaucers in the end. Genghis Rex has deep feelings for Teryx and even attempted to kidnap and marry her, but she resisted since she was in love with Ichy and objected to his ways. Rex also has an equally evil sister residing on Reptilon, named Princess Dei. Despite being evil, Rex does display respect and honor towards others at times and his relationship with Allo and the Dinosaucers implies they are more like rivals than enemies. *Princess Dei is an evolved Deinonychus with yellow-green skin who is Genghis Rex's older sister and the only female Tyranno. She appears a few times in episodes where the cast returns to Reptilon. It is generally believed that she is the leader of the Tyrannos' movement on Reptilon. Almost as strong as her younger brother, but more intelligent and agile, she demonstrates considerable skill in battle. She also constantly scolds her brother when things go wrong, something no other Tyranno has the courage to do. She appears less than the others due to still being partially tied with her matters at Reptilon. Her name is a reference to Princess Diana. *Ankylo, an evolved Ankylosaurus, is Genghis Rex's dimwitted, sycophantic assistant and is another member of the Tyrannos. Ankylo bears a resemblance to a warthog and exhibits porcine characteristics, often snorting when he speaks. He wears grey armor, has red skin and has a special weapon called the Anklebuster which creates a chain made out of energy, often used to disable the Dinosaucers. He is the most loyal Tyranno to Genghis Rex and constantly gives him advice about his schemes and tells him to back off about his feelings for Teryx, although in the latter case, his suggestions fall on deaf ears due to the intensity of Rex's emotions. *Quackpot is an evolved Hadrosaurus. Quackpot is the practical joker of the group, much to the ire of the other Tyrannos. Like Ankylo, Quackpot is red with white on his bill, neck and belly. He wears grey, blueish armor and goes also goes barefoot. Quackpot makes a quacking sound like a duck in comparison to his appearance. In episode 63, Quackpot was the star of a children's television show back on Reptilon called Duckbill's Playhouse, under the stage name T.B. Duckbill. Therefore, he objects to harming children and even protects and cares for them at times. *Brachio is an evolved Brachiosaurus. Brachio is the archetypal thug of the gang and is purple. Brachio is the evil counterpart of Bronto Thunder. Physically the strongest among the Tyrannos, Brachio nevertheless follows Genghis Rex's orders to the letter and is not very bright though not at the same degree of stupidity as Bonehead. *Styraco is an evolved Styracosaurus. Styraco is the evil counterpart of Tricero. He is orange and wears yellow armor and goes barefoot. Styraco was formerly a dentist working at the office of Pinchem, Pullem & Yankem before joining Genghis Rex on Earth. He is intelligent and sometimes works with machines though not as often as Plesio. Like Ankylo, he is extremely loyal to Rex. He is sensitive to mental pressure and can behave in a deranged way when pushed to the brink of his sanity. He likes to eat, and really hates water. *Plesio is an evolved Plesiosaurus, a prehistoric aquatic reptile. Plesio is cunning and shifty, looks like a pink dragon, and is the \\"evil\\" counterpart of Ichy. Like Ichy, Plesio can talk to sea creatures. Plesio used to work for Slither, Slither & Shark, Attorneys at Law on Reptilon before becoming a Tyranno. He once had a romantic relationship with the Loch Ness Monster. He serves as the scientist/inventor of the group. He does understand marine creatures and became obsessed in freeing some at the episode Age of Aquariums, though he only wanted to have an army of his own. Plesio seems to be most distant from Genghis Rex than the rest of the Tyrannos. *Terrible Dactyl is the flying member of the Tyrannos and the evil counterpart of Teryx. He speaks with a British accent. He wears a pilot mask, purple armor, and a white scarf and has orange skin. Terrible Dactyl is an evolved Pteranodon, a pterosaur which is commonly referred to as a Pterodactyl. In a large proportion of the episodes, Terrible Dactyl begins the conflict between the Dinosaucers and Tyrannos by observing some \\"suspicious\\" activity and reporting it to Genghis Rex. Unlike a true Pteranodon, Terrible Dactyl has teeth and a long rhamphorhynchoid - style tail. He has a soft spot for baby Pteranodon and even once helped the Dinosaucers protect some in the episode Eggs Marks the Spot, showing there is some good on this mostly evil- willed being after all. Additionally, he is of a more sporting nature than the other Tyrannos and will sometimes leave a conflict voluntarily if his side has an unfair advantage in numbers. =Minor characters= *The Dinosorcerer and Dinosorceress are the leaders of Reptilon. He is a Megalosaurus and she is a Plateosaurus, They prefer to rule at arm's length, staying out of the squabbles of the Dinosaucers and Tyrannos as parents would their children. They are very powerful, as shown in episodes where they levitate objects and heal deadly diseases. In addition, they are also Allo's uncle and aunt. They possess a \\"Book of Reptilonian Wisdom\\" which predicts the future. *Apatty Saurus is an evolved Apatosaurus and is Bronto Thunder's girlfriend on Reptilon. She is an expert swamp boater and became a partner at the Color Rep- Tiles tile shop, where Bronto Thunder once worked, sometime after Bronto left for Earth. *Major Clifton appears in a couple episodes, although it is never revealed when he and the Dinosaucers first met. He is portrayed as a U.S. Air Force officer who is trying to discover the truth about the Dinosaucers, at the expense of his reputation. He knows the Secret Scouts know about the Dinosaucers and confides in them about his theories, although the scouts do their best not to verify them. He currently is the caretaker of a large undersea creature that latched onto him the way newborn animals do when they hatch. *The Furballs, Ugh and Grunt, are balls of fur who are equivalent to quite-intelligent pets on Reptilon. They get into trouble more often than not in each episode in which they appear, but end up saving the day for the Dinosaucers since Tyrannos are allergic to them. They are brave and daring despite their size and seemingly frail appearance. They either have arms or legs, but not both. They're also able to talk and are afraid of ghosts. *Captain Sabretooth and Smilin'Don: Evolved Smilodon. They are space pirates with advance weapons that rivals Reptilon's, like a device that naturalizes the Dinosaucers' and Tyrannos' Fossilizers. They're part of a group called the 'Sabretooths' it is said that were invaders of Reptilon, according to the Dinosaucers, but both Captain Sabretooth and Smilin' Don seem to state that Reptilon was their home. Either way, it took all of Reptilon to get and keep the Sabretooths off the planet. They can be fended off with cat nip, a little gift Sara gives to the Dinosaucers and Tyrannos in order to keep them away afterwards. *Nessie: Known as the Loch Ness Monster, she is a female Elasmosaurus. Upon meeting Plesio, she falls in love with him and though Genghis Rex plans to turn her a member of the Tyrannos, Plesio loves her to the point of denying Rex's command and even defossilize the Dinosaucers to help free her. Even though she is offered to become a Dinosaucer, she declines. She became a close friend to Teryx due to both being females and kept her love to Plesio despite his evil roots. She is currently an ally and friend to the Dinosaucers. She debuted in the episode Lochs and Bay Gulls. *Dinosaur Dundy (Joseph Dunderback): An Australian human scientist obsessed with studying biology. He once studied the lifeforms on a swamp but changed his focus and started to study dinosaurs. Due to some radioactive material leaking while he was transporting them some of the creatures in the swamp mutated, gained intelligence (about level of Bonehead) and the ability to talk. The mutated creatures on the swamp felt his uninterest and started to behave wildly or strangely in order to draw his attention. Crocodiles, turtles and snakes are his closest friends. In the end, he resumes his original quest and becomes an ally and friend to the Dinosaucers alongside his reptilian comrades. He debuted in the episode named after him. He likes to drive watercrafts in order for his reptilian friends to ski in the swamp. He is based on Paul Hogan's movie character, Crocodile Dundee. *Turtleback and Shellhead: Two mutated Earthling turtles which are some of Dinosaur Dundy's closest friends. They have cheerful personalities and good will. Dundy refers to them as \\"two of the slipperies characters he has ever met\\". They also relate well with the Dinosaucers due to them all being reptiles. Though initially hostile and mischievous, they eventually learn the error of their ways and begin enjoying life for what is worth it. They made their debut in the episode Dinosaur Dundy. They love to ski in the swamp. *Crockpot: A mutated Earthling crocodile whom Dinosaur Dundy has cared since it was a hatchling. He became aggressive after Dinosaur Dundy forgot about him and only reverted when he gave up his obsession and returned to the passion of studying the creatures of the swamps. All he wanted was attention and notice from his old human friend after all. He began to enjoy life alongside his human and reptile friends. He was introduced to the series in the episode Dinosaur Dundy. He takes a liking to skiing since then. *Marty and Snake Eyes: Two mutated Earth snakes which are friends to Dinosaur Dundy. They are also close to the other mutated reptiles on the swamp. They are left to guard Sara by Crockpot but tag along with Sara after getting bored. They are very sympathetic, docile and friendly. They debuted in the episode Dinosaur Dundy and Sara states them to be musicians. They learn how to ski and greatly enjoy adventure.

Life  He was born at Enkhuizen. He studied at the University of Groningen, Leiden, and Utrecht. He was ordained in the ministry, becoming the pastor of Westwoud in 1656 and afterwards at Wormer, Goes, and Leeuwarden. He became professor of divinity successively at the University of Franeker in 1675 and at the University of Utrecht in 1680. Witsius became Chancellor of Utrecht University in 1686. In 1698 he was appointed to the University of Leiden as the successor of the younger Friedrich Spanheim. He died in Leiden.  Views  While in his theology Witsius aimed at a reconciliation between the reigning orthodoxy and Covenant Theology (also known as federalism), he was first of all a Biblical theologian, his principal field being systematic theology. His chief work is entitled The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man (originally published in Latin: De oeconomia foederum Dei cum hominibus, Leeuwarden, 1677). He was induced to publish this work by his grief at the controversies between Voetians and Cocceians. Although himself a member of the federalistic school, he was in no way blind to the value of the scholastically established dogmatic system of the Church.

Gannex raincoats were worn by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, a friend of his. Kagan was sent to prison for ten months in 1980 for tax evasion. Early life He was born Juozapas Kaganas into a Litvak family in Lithuania. His parents Benjamin and Miriam Kagan had built up a successful textile business in Kaunas. He first came to England in 1933 to study at the University of Leeds but returned to Lithuania where he was trapped on the outbreak of the Second World War in Kaunas. His father was away when the Soviets invaded in 1940, and escaped bound for Britain, (Benjamin, his father, was the second oldest man in Britain when he died at the age of 109.) Unusually, Kagan was allowed to retain the family's woollen factory leading to (unproven) suspicions he was an agent of the Russian security services. The Nazis invaded Lithuania during summer 1941 and Kagan was interned by them. He married Margarita Shtromaite (later Lady Kagan) in the Kaunas Ghetto. The newlyweds and Kagan's mother, Mira managed to survive over three years in this ghetto. First, they were ordinary inmates, but when Kagan realised there was no chance of their surviving unless they escaped, he organised a hiding place for himself, his new wife and his mother in a factory just outside the ghetto walls. The three lived in a small box in the factory attic for nine months, kept alive by the efforts of a Lithuanian non-Jew, Vytautas Rinkevicius, who risked his and his family's life to save them. Life in England When the Nazis were ousted from Lithuania, Joseph and Margaret Kagan made their way to Bucharest and from there, to Britain. From 1946 he settled in Huddersfield and began work as a blanket weaver. He founded Kagan Textiles Ltd. at a small factory opposite Elland Town Hall. In 1951, Kagan invented Gannex leading to his firm' expansion and its move to a larger mill in Dewsbury Road. After the then opposition trade spokesman, Harold Wilson, wore a Gannex coat on a world tour in 1956, the raincoats became fashion icons, and were worn by world leaders such as Lyndon Johnson, Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev, as well as by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh. In addition they were worn by Arctic and Antarctic explorers, Himalayan climbers, the armed services and police forces in Britain and Canada. The success of the new fabric made Kagan a multi-millionaire and a series of mergers, takeovers and outright purchases put Kagan Textiles in control of one of the most efficient combines in the textile and clothing industries. In 1967, he bought Barkisland Hall, Barkisland as accommodation for visitors to his company. Huddersfield was the home town of Harold Wilson, later Leader of the Opposition in 1963, and Kagan became close to Wilson and provided funding for his private office. In Wilson's first resignation honours list in 1970, Kagan was given a knighthood. In 1971, a defecting KGB agent, Oleg Lyalin, relayed accounts of Kagan boasting of his connection to Wilson, leading to MI5 placing him under surveillance, but finding no evidence of spying. =Fall from grace= When Wilson resigned as Prime Minister in March 1976, Kagan was made a life peer as Baron Kagan, of Elland in the County of West Yorkshire, in the 1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours, taking the Labour Party whip. Kagan was later charged with tax evasion, though the formal charges were styled as \\"theft\\" (of barrels of indigo dye) from his, by then, former company and \\"false accounting\\", to comply with extradition treaties which did not cover tax offences. After a stay in Tel Aviv, he was arrested in Paris and extradited to Britain. On 12 December 1980, he was convicted of four counts of theft. He was fined ¬£375,000 and served a ten-month sentence, first in Armley, then in Rudgate open prison, Yorkshire. He lost his knighthood, but his peerage could not be forfeited. It was also revealed around this time that Kagan had been friendly with Richardas Vaygauskas, a former official at the Russian embassy, who was known to be a KGB agent. However, Tam Dalyell in his 1995 obituary of Kagan, believed that he had maintained such contacts to assist relatives in Vilnius; Vaygauskas was also from Lithuania. After his release from custody, Kagan returned to the House of Lords and spoke on prison reform. In 1994 his health deteriorated, and he died peacefully in his London apartment the following year.

Whilst most white Americans enjoy legally or socially sanctioned privileges and rights, these same privileges and rights can be denied to members of other races and minority groups. European Americans, particularly affluent white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, are said to have enjoyed advantages in matters of education, immigration, voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure throughout American history. Groups which were especially impacted by racism included non-Protestant immigrants from Europe, including the Irish, Poles, and Italians, who were often subjected to xenophobic exclusion and other forms of ethnically-based discrimination in American society until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Historically, Hispanics have continuously experienced racism in the United States despite the fact that many of them have European ancestry. Middle Eastern groups such as Jews, Arabs, and Iranians have continuously faced discrimination in the United States, and as a result, some people who belong to these groups do not identify as, and are not perceived to be, white. African Americans faced restrictions on their political, social, and economic freedoms throughout much of United States history. Native Americans have experienced genocide, forced removals, massacres, and discrimination. In addition, East, South, and Southeast Asians along with Pacific Islanders have also been discriminated against. Major racially and ethnically structured institutions and manifestations of racism have included genocide, slavery, segregation, Native American reservations, Native American boarding schools, immigration and naturalization laws, and internment camps. Formal racial discrimination was largely banned by the mid-20th century and over time, it came to be perceived as being socially and morally unacceptable. Racial politics remains a major phenomenon, and racism continues to be reflected in socioeconomic inequality.Henry, P. J., David O. Sears. Race and Politics: The Theory of Symbolic Racism. University of California, Los Angeles. 2002. In recent years research has uncovered extensive evidence of racial discrimination in various sectors of modern U.S. society, including the criminal justice system, business, the economy, housing, health care, the media, and politics. In the view of the United Nations and the U.S. Human Rights Network, \\"discrimination in the United States permeates all aspects of life and extends to all communities of color.\\" Some Americans saw the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, who served as president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and was the nation's first black president, as a sign that the nation had entered a new, post-racial era. The election of President Donald Trump in 2016, who was a chief proponent of the racist birther movement in the US (which argued that Obama was not born in the United States) and ran a racially tinged campaign, has been viewed by some commentators as a racist backlash against the election of Barack Obama. Before and after the election, Trump has had a history of speech and actions that have been widely viewed as racist or racially charged. During the mid-2010s, American society has seen a resurgence of high levels of racism and discrimination. One new phenomenon has been the rise of the \\"alt- right\\" movement: a white nationalist coalition that seeks the expulsion of sexual and racial minorities from the United States. Since the mid-2010s, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have identified white supremacist violence as the leading threat of domestic terrorism in the United States. Racism Racism is a systematized form of oppression which is developed by members of one race in order to persecute members of another race. Prejudicial attitudes existed between races for thousands of years, but systematized racial oppression first arose in the 1600s along with capitalism; the confluence of the two, capitalism and racial oppression, was deemed racial capitalism. Before this period, racism did not exist and in many cultures, slaves were usually taken as a result of military conquest. But when European traders discovered that their superior technology gave them a tremendous advantage in Africa, including their sailing ships and firearms, they began to plunder Africa's wealth and take slaves. Slavers and slave owners both tried to justify the practice of slavery by convincing themselves that before their African slaves were captured and enslaved, they had no previous culture and lived like savages, a totally false assumption. White European Americans who participated in the slave industry tried to justify their economic exploitation of black people by creating a \\"scientific\\" theory of white superiority and black inferiority. One such slave owner was Thomas Jefferson, and it was his call for science to determine the obvious \\"inferiority\\" of blacks that is regarded as \\"an extremely important stage in the evolution of scientific racism.\\" He concluded that blacks were \\"inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind.\\"Paul Finkelman (November 12, 2012). \\"The Monster of Monticello\\". The New York Times. Retrieved July 14, 2020. Anti-miscegenation laws, which forbade marriage and even sex between whites and non-whites (which typically covered blacks but in some cases also Indians and Asians), existed in most of the states well into the 20th century, even after emancipation and even in states that advocated the abolition of slavery. Such anti-miscegenation laws existed in many states until 1967, when the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Loving v. Virginia that such laws were unconstitutional. Citizenship The Naturalization Act of 1790 set the first uniform rules for the granting of United States citizenship by naturalization, which limited naturalisation to \\"free white person[s]‚Äù, thus excluding from citizenship Native Americans, indentured servants, slaves, free blacks and later Asians. Citizenship and the lack of it had special impact on various legal and political rights, most notably suffrage rights at both the federal and state level, as well as the right to hold certain government offices, jury duty, military service, and many other activities, besides access to government assistance and services. The second Militia Act of 1792 also provided for the conscription of every \\"free able-bodied white male citizen\\".second Militia Act of 1792 Tennessee's 1834 Constitution included a provision: ‚Äúthe free white men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common defence.‚Äù The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, made under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, allowed those Choctaw Indians who chose to remain in Mississippi to gain recognition as US citizens, the first major non-European ethnic group to become entitled to US citizenship. During the American Civil War, as a war necessity, the Militia Act of 1862, for the first time, allowed African-Americans to serve in the Union militias as soldiers and war laborers. By such enrolment, these blacks and their families were freed from slavery, if their owner was a rebel. However, black members were discriminated against in pay, with black members being paid half of white members. Besides discrimination in pay, colored units were often disproportionately assigned laborer work, rather than combat assignments.James McPherson, \\"The Negro's Civil War\\". General Daniel Ullman, commander of the Corps d'Afrique, remarked \\"I fear that many high officials outside of Washington have no other intention than that these men shall be used as diggers and drudges.\\"Official Record Ser. III Vol. III p. 1126 Black members were organised into colored regiments. By the end of that war, in April 1865, there were 175 colored regiments constituting about one-tenth of the Union Army. About 20% of colored soldiers died, about 35% higher than that of white Union troops. The 1862 Militia Act, however, did not open military service to all races, only to black Americans. Non-whites were not permitted to serve in the Confederate army, except sometimes for camp labor. The Naturalization Act of 1870 extended naturalization to black persons, but not to other non-white persons, but revoked the citizenship of naturalized Chinese Americans. The law relied on coded language to exclude \\"aliens ineligible for citizenship\\" which primarily applied to Chinese and Japanese immigrants. Native Americans were granted citizenship in a piece-meal manner until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which unilaterally bestowed on them blanket citizenship status, whether they belonged to a federally recognized tribe or not, though by that date two- thirds of Native Americans had already become US citizens by various means. The Act was not retroactive, so that citizenship did not extend to Native Americans born before the effective date of the 1924 Act, or outside of the United States as an indigenous person. Even Native Americans who gained citizenship under the 1924 Act were not guaranteed voting rights until 1948. According to a survey by the Department of Interior, seven states still refused to grant Indians voting rights in 1938. Discrepancies between federal and state control provided loopholes in the Act's enforcement. States justified discrimination based on state statutes and constitutions. Three main arguments for Indian voting exclusion were Indian exemption from real estate taxes, maintenance of tribal affiliation and the notion that Indians were under guardianship, or lived on lands controlled by federal trusteeship. By 1947, all states with large Indian populations, except Arizona and New Mexico, had extended voting rights to Native Americans who qualified under the 1924 Act. Finally, in 1948, a judicial decision forced the remaining states to withdraw their prohibition on Indian voting. Further changes to racial eligibility for citizenship by naturalization were made after 1940, when eligibility was extended to \\"descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere,\\" \\"Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent,\\" \\"Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent,\\" and \\"persons of races indigenous to India.\\" The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 prohibits racial and gender discrimination in naturalization. Citizenship, however, did not guarantee any particular rights, such as the vote. Black Americans, for example, who gained formal US citizenship by 1870, were subjected to Black Codes and were soon disenfranchised in the Southern states by various strategies, as well as being persecuted and otherwise discriminated against in those states and beyond.  African Americans  = Pre-Civil War = Slavery, as a form of forced labor, has existed in many cultures, dating back to early human civilizations. Slavery is not inherently racial per se. In the United States, however, slavery became racialized by the time of the American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783), when slavery was widely institutionalized as a racial caste system which was based on African ancestry and skin color.  Atlantic slave trade  Reproduction of a handbill advertising a slave auction in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1769. The Atlantic slave trade prospered, with more than 470,000 slaves having been forcibly transported from Africa between 1626 and 1860 to what is now the United States. Prior to the Civil War, eight serving presidents owned slaves, a practice which was protected by the U.S. Constitution. Providing wealth for the white elite, approximately one in four Southern families held slaves prior to the Civil War. According to the 1860 U.S. census, there were about 385,000 slave owners out of a white population of approximately 7 million in the slave states.Alonzo L. Hamby, George Clack, and Mildred Sola Neely. \\"Outline of US History\\" . US Department of State. Groups of armed white men, called slave patrols, were formed to monitor enslaved African Americans. First established in South Carolina in 1704 and spread to other slave states, their function was to police slaves, especially runaways. Slave owners feared slaves might organize a revolt or rebellion, so state militias were formed to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols to detect, encounter, and crush any organized slave meetings that might lead to revolt or rebellion.Loewen, James W. Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong. The New Press, 2013. Print.  Steps toward the abolition of slavery  Scars of a whipped slave, April 2, 1863, Baton Rouge, Louisiana During the 1820s and 1830s, the solution of the American Colonization Society (ACS) to the presence of free blacks was to persuade them to emigrate to Africa. In 1821, the ACS established the colony of Liberia, and persuaded thousands of former slaves and free black people to move there. Some slaves were manumitted (set free) on condition that they emigrate. The slave states made no secret that they wanted to get rid of free blacks, who they believed threatened their investment, the slaves, encouraging escapes and revolts. The support for the ACS was primarily Southern. The founder of the ACS, Henry Clay of Kentucky, stated that because of \\"unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country.

Advertisement by a slave trader offering various amounts for slaves in Lexington, Kentucky, 1853 Although the ‚Äúimportation‚Äù of slaves into the United States was outlawed by federal law from 1808, the domestic trade in slaves continued to be a major economic activity. Maryland and Virginia, for example, would \\"export\\" its surplus slaves to the south. (See Franklin and Armfield Office.) Enslaved family members could be split up (ie., sold off) never to see or hear of each other again. Between 1830 and 1840, nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines. In the 1850s, more than 193,000 were transported, and historians estimate nearly one million in total were traded. Slavery itself was abolished in the 1860s. Ashley's Sack is a cloth that recounts a slave sale separating a mother and her daughter.

Rose filled the sack with a dress, braid of her hair, pecans, and \\"my love always\\" The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the \\"Second Middle Passage\\", because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the Middle Passage (the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America).

Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families who had been in the U.S. for many generations. =Emancipation= Slaves Waiting for Sale: Richmond, Virginia. 1853 President Lincoln‚Äôs Emancipation Proclamation, which came into effect on January 1, 1863, marked a change in the federal government's position on slavery. (Up to that time, the federal government had never even taken a limited pro-emancipation stance, and it could only do so in 1862 because of the 1861 departure of almost all of the Southern members of Congress). Though the proclamation was welcomed by abolitionists, its application had limitations. It did not apply, for example, to the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and the new state of West Virginia, and it also did not apply in those portions of some states which were loyal to the Union, such as Virginia. In those states, slavery remained legal until abolished by state action, or by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865. Lincoln believed that the federal government did not have the authority to abolish slavery; that would violate states' rights. But he was also Commander of the Armed Forces. An action against states which were in rebellion, a step towards their defeat, was entirely appropriate. The South interpreted it as a hostile act. This allowed Lincoln to abolish slavery to a limited extent, without igniting resistance from anti-abolitionist forces in the Union. None of the slaves who lived outside the border areas were immediately affected, and it was the invading Northern armies which enforced the prohibition. While personally opposed to slavery (see Abraham Lincoln and slavery), Lincoln believed that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to end it, stating in his first Inaugural Address that he \\"had no objection to [this] being made express and irrevocable\\" via the Corwin Amendment. On social and political rights for blacks, Lincoln stated, \\"I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people, I as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race.\\"Abraham Lincoln, \\"Speeches and Writings 1832‚Äì1858: Speeches, Letters, and Miscellaneous Writings : the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Volume 1\\". p. 638. Library of America, 1989 The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to areas which were loyal to, or controlled by, the Union. Slavery was not actually abolished in the U.S. until the passage of the 13th Amendment which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.XIII ‚Äì Slavery Abolished The Avalon Project About four million black slaves were freed in 1865. 95% of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of its total population, while only 5% of blacks lived in the North, comprising only 1% of its total population. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15 Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of males who were aged 13 to 43 died in the Civil War, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South. Though the Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States, some black Americans became subjected to revised forms of involuntary labor, particularly in the South, such as Black Codes that restricted African Americans' freedom, and compelled them to work for low wages. They were also subject to white supremacist violence, and selective enforcement of statutes. = Reconstruction Era to World War II =  Reconstruction Era  lynching of Will James, Cairo, Illinois, 1909. A crowd of thousands watched the lynching. After the Civil War, the 13th amendment which was passed in 1865, formally abolishing slavery, was ratified. Furthermore, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which broadened a range of civil rights and granted them to all persons who were born in the United States. Despite this, the emergence of \\"Black Codes\\", sanctioned acts of subjugation against blacks, continued to bar African-Americans from exercising their due civil rights. The Naturalization Act of 1790 only granted U.S. citizenship to whites, and in 1868 the effort to broaden civil rights was underscored by the passage of the 14th amendment which granted citizenship to blacks. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 followed, which was eliminated in a decision that undermined federal power to thwart private racial discrimination. Nonetheless, the last of the Reconstruction Era amendments, the 15th amendment promised voting rights to African-American men (previously only white men of property could vote), and these cumulative federal efforts, African-Americans began taking advantage of enfranchisement. African-Americans began voting, seeking office positions, utilizing public education. By the end of Reconstruction in the mid 1870s, violent white supremacists came to power via paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts and the White League and imposed Jim Crow laws which deprived African-Americans of voting rights by instituting systemic and discriminatory policies of unequal racial segregation. Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with the passage and enforcement of Jim Crow laws, along with the posting of signs which were used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat.Leon Litwack, Jim Crow Blues, Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004) For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with.

We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.‚Äù The new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Throughout the post Civil War period, racial stratification was informally and systemically enforced, in order to solidify the pre-existing social order. Although they were technically able to vote, poll taxes, pervasive acts of terrorism such as lynchings (often perpetrated by hate groups such as the reborn Ku Klux Klan, founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as grandfather clauses kept black Americans (and many Poor Whites) disenfranchised particularly in the South. Furthermore, the discrimination was extended to state legislation which \\"allocated vastly unequal financial support\\" for black and white schools. In addition to this, county officials sometimes redistributed resources which were earmarked for blacks to white schools, further undermining educational opportunities. In response to de jure racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.Kwame Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., eds.

During the 1921 Tulsa race riot thousands of whites rampaged through the black community, killing men and women, burning and looting stores and homes. Up to 300 blacks were killed. This era is sometimes referred to as the nadir of American race relations because racism, segregation, racial discrimination, and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including race riots such as the Atlanta Race riot of 1906 and the Tulsa race riot of 1921. The Atlanta riot was characterized as a \\"racial massacre of negroes\\" by the French newspaper Le Petit Journal.\\"Un lynchage monstre\\" (September 24, 1906) Le Petit Journal The Charleston News and Courier wrote in response to the Atlanta riots: \\"Separation of the races is the only radical solution of the negro problem in this country.

Within Chicago, for example, between 1910 and 1970, the percentage of African-Americans leapt from 2.0 percent to 32.7 percent. The demographic patterns of black migrants and external economic conditions are largely studied stimulants regarding the Great Migration. For example, migrating blacks (between 1910 and 1920) were more likely to be literate than blacks who remained in the South. Known economic push factors played a role in migration, such as the emergence of a split labor market and agricultural distress which resulted from the boll weevil destruction of the cotton economy. housing project erected this sign. Detroit, 1942. Southern migrants were often treated in accordance with pre-existing racial stratification. The rapid influx of blacks into the North and West disturbed the racial balance within cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white residents in the two regions. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans in most Northern and Western cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. In 1900 Reverend Matthew Anderson, speaking at the annual Hampton Negro Conference in Virginia, said that \\"...the lines along most of the avenues of wage earning are more rigidly drawn in the North than in the South. There seems to be an apparent effort throughout the North, especially in the cities to debar the colored worker from all the avenues of higher remunerative labor, which makes it more difficult to improve his economic condition even than in the South.\\" Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of \\"targeted violence, restrictive covenants, redlining and racial steering\\".

The Creek were originally from the Alabama region. Native Americans have lived on the North American continent for at least 10,000 years and millions of Native Americans were living in what is today the United States at the time European settlers first arrived on it.Mann, Charles C., 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, Vintage Books, 2006, c.2005, p. 18 During the colonial and independent periods, European settlers waged a long series of conflicts, often with the objective of obtaining the resources of Native Americans. Through wars, forced displacement (such as the Trail of Tears), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken. The loss of land often resulted in hardships for Native Americans. In the early 18th century, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws. After the creation of the United States, the idea of Indian removal gained momentum. However, some Native Americans chose or were allowed to remain and avoided removal whereafter they were subjected to official racism. The Choctaws in Mississippi described their situation in 1849, \\"we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died.\\" Joseph B. Cobb, who moved to Mississippi from Georgia, described the Choctaws as having \\"no nobility or virtue at all,\\" and in some respect he found blacks, especially native Africans, to be more interesting and admirable, the red man's superior in every way. The Choctaw and Chickasaw, the tribes he knew best, were beneath contempt, that is, even worse than black slaves. The Ghost Dance ritual. The Natives believed the dance would reunite the living with the spirits of the dead, bring the spirits of the dead to fight on their behalf, make the white invaders vanish, and bring peace, prosperity, and unity to Indian peoples throughout the region In the 1800s, ideologies such as Manifest destiny, which held the view that the United States was destined to expand from coast to coast on the North American continent, fueled U.S. attacks against, and maltreatment of, Native Americans. In the years leading up to the Indian Removal Act of 1830 there were many armed conflicts between settlers and Native Americans.Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Stephen Aron, Stephen Kotkin, Suzanne Marchand, Gyan Prakash, Michael Tsin, W.W.

An egregious attempt occurred with the California gold rush, the first two years of which saw the death of thousands of Native Americans. Under Mexican rule in California, Indians were subjected to de facto enslavement under a system of peonage by the white elite. While in 1850, California formally entered the Union as a free state, with respect to the issue of slavery, the practice of Indian indentured servitude was not outlawed by the California Legislature until 1863.Castillo, Edward D.

Notable conflicts in this period include the Dakota War, Great Sioux War, Snake War and Colorado War. In the years leading up to the Wounded Knee massacre the U.S. government had continued to seize Lakota lands. A Ghost Dance ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, led to the U.S. Army's attempt to subdue the Lakota. The dance was part of a religion founded by Wovoka that told of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering of Native Americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the Ghost Dance properly, the European American invaders would vanish, the bison would return, and the living and the dead would be reunited in an Edenic world. On December 29, 1890, at Wounded Knee, gunfire erupted, and U.S. soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women and children. During the period surrounding the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, author L. Frank Baum wrote two editorials about Native Americans. Five days after the killing of the Lakota Sioux holy man, Sitting Bull, Baum wrote, \\"The proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by the law of conquest, by a justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.\\" Full text of both, with commentary by professor A. Waller Hastings Following the December 29, 1890, massacre, Baum wrote, \\"The Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extermination [sic] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.

Many Native Americans were moved to reservations‚Äîconstituting 4% of U.S. territory. In a number of cases, treaties signed with Native Americans were violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a residential school system which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy.Ward Churchill, Kill the Indian, Save the Man, 2006. The basis for this theory was that inside every native person, there was a repressed white person screaming to come to the surface. Abuse both physical and psychological was common in these schools, and often their objective of 'compulsory whiteness' was not even ultimately achieved, with many of the Indians who later returned to the reservations afterwards not at all 'becoming white', but instead simply becoming heavy alcoholics and displaying signs of permanent psychological distress, and even mental illness. Further, these individuals were often either totally unemployable or only marginally employed, as it was sensed by those around them that on the one hand, they had not successfully assimilated into 'white society', nor were they any longer acceptable to the Indian societies from which they had originated.

America's first president, George Washington, formulated a policy to encourage the \\"civilizing\\" process. The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited citizenship to whites only. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans. Prior to the passage of the act, nearly two-thirds of Native Americans were already U.S. citizens. The earliest recorded date of Native Americans becoming U.S. citizens was in 1831 when the Mississippi Choctaw became citizens after the United States Legislature ratified the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Under article XIV of that treaty, any Choctaw who elected not to move to Native American Territory could become an American citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification.

They mandated \\"separate but equal\\" status for blacks. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those which were provided to whites. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks.

For example, in February 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four young African-American college students entered a Woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service. The men had learned about non-violent protest in college, and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter, pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes. After this, many sit- ins took place in order to non-violently protest against racism and inequality. Sit-ins continued throughout the South and spread to other areas. Eventually, after many sit-ins and other non-violent protests, including marches and boycotts, places began to agree to desegregate.Carol Berkin, Christopher Miller, Robert Cherny, James Gormly (2011). \\"Making America: A History of the United States, Volume 2: From 1865\\". p. 749.

The practice was fought first through passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities. Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms. Up until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called \\"the Negro market\\" was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. with advertising focused on whites. Blacks were also denied commercial deals. On his decision to take part in exhibition races against racehorses in order to earn money, Olympic champion Jesse Owens stated, \\"People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.\\" On the lack of opportunities, Owens added, \\"There was no television, no big advertising, no endorsements then. Not for a black man, anyway.\\"Entine, Jon (2000). Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and why We are Afraid to Talk about it. PublicAffairs. p. 187. In the reception to honor his Olympic success Owens was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the Waldorf Astoria New York and instead forced to travel up to the event in a freight elevator. The first black Academy Award recipient Hattie McDaniel was not permitted to attend the premiere of Gone with the Wind with Georgia being racially segregated, and at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles she was required to sit at a segregated table at the far wall of the room; the hotel had a strict no-blacks policy, but allowed McDaniel in as a favor. Her final wish to be buried in Hollywood Cemetery was denied because the graveyard was restricted to whites only. As the civil rights movement and the dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern U.S, a Republican Party electoral strategy ‚Äì the Southern strategy ‚Äì was enacted in order to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans.Carter, Dan T. From George Wallace to Newt Gingrich: Race in the Conservative Counterrevolution, 1963‚Äì1994. p. 35. Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party. In 1971, angered by African delegates at the UN siding against the U.S. in a vote, then Governor of California Ronald Reagan stated in a phone call to president Nixon, \\"To see those... monkeys from those African countries - damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!\\"\\"Ronald Reagan called Africans at UN 'monkeys', tapes reveal\\". BBC. Retrieved July 31, 2019 The perception that the Republican Party had served as the \\"vehicle of white supremacy in the South\\", particularly post 1964, made it difficult for the Party to win back the support of black voters in the South in later years.  1980s to the present  The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where nine black church-goers, including the pastor, were killed by a white man in the 2015 Charleston church shooting. The church had been rebuilt after one of its co-founders, Denmark Vesey, was suspected of planning a slave rebellion in Charleston in 1822; 35 people, including Vesey, were hanged and the church was burned down. While substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment, black poverty and lack of education continued in the context of de-industrialization.Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America (New York: Little, Brown & Co., 1993), 400‚Äì414. Despite gains made after the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, some violence against black churches has also continued ‚Äì 145 fires were set to churches around the South in the 1990s, and a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina was committed in 2015 at the historic Mother Emanuel Church. From 1981 to 1997, the United States Department of Agriculture discriminated against tens of thousands of black American farmers, denying loans that were provided to white farmers in similar circumstances. The discrimination was the subject of the Pigford v. Glickman lawsuit brought by members of the National Black Farmers Association, which resulted in two settlement agreements of $1.06 billion in 1999 and of $1.25 billion in 2009. During the 1980s and '90s, a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities. The 1980 Miami riots were catalyzed by the killing of an African-American motorist by four white Miami-Dade Police officers. They were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering. Similarly, the six-day 1992 Los Angeles riots erupted after the acquittal of four white LAPD officers who had been filmed beating Rodney King, an African-American motorist. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the Director of the Harlem-based Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture has identified more than 100 instances of mass racial violence in the United States since 1935 and has noted that almost every instance was precipitated by a police incident. Politically, the \\"winner-take-all\\" structure that applies to 48 out of 50 states in the electoral college benefits white representation, as no state has voters of color as the majority of the electorate. This has been described as structural bias and often leads voters of color to feel politically alienated, and therefore not to vote. The lack of representation in Congress has also led to lower voter turnout. As of 2016, African Americans only made up 8.7% of Congress, and Latinos 7%. Many cite the 2008 United States presidential election as a step forward in race relations: white Americans played a role in electing Barack Obama, the country's first black president.White Americans play major role in electing the first black president, Los Angeles Times In fact, Obama received a greater percentage of the white vote (43%), than did the previous Democratic candidate, John Kerry (41%). Racial divisions persisted throughout the election; wide margins of Black voters gave Obama an edge during the presidential primary, where 8 out of 10 African-Americans voted for him in the primaries, and an MSNBC poll found that race was a key factor in whether a candidate was perceived as being ready for office. In South Carolina, for instance, \\"Whites were far likelier to name Clinton than Obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief, likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the White House in November. Blacks named Obama over Clinton by even stronger margins‚Äîtwo- and three-to one‚Äîin all three areas.\\" Sociologist Russ Long stated in 2013 that there is now a more subtle racism that associates a specific race with a specific characteristic.Long, Russ. \\"How to Think about Racial and Ethnic Inequality\\" . In a 1993 study conducted by Katz and Braly, it was presented that \\"blacks and whites hold a variety of stereotypes towards each other, often negative\\". The Katz and Braley study also found that African-Americans and whites view the traits that they identify each other with as threatening, interracial communication between the two is likely to be \\"hesitant, reserved, and concealing\\". Interracial communication is guided by stereotypes; stereotypes are transferred into personality and character traits which then have an effect on communication. Multiple factors go into how stereotypes are established, such as age and the setting in which they are being applied. For example, in a study done by the Entman-Rojecki Index of Race and Media in 2014, 89% of black women in movies are shown swearing and exhibiting offensive behavior while only 17% of white women are portrayed in this manner.Orbe, Mark P., and Tina M. Harris. \\"Interracial Communication: Theory Into Practice.\\"Google Books. Sage Publications, n.d. Web. February 2, 2014 In 2012, Trayvon Martin, a seventeen-year-old teenager, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, claimed that Martin was being suspicious and called the Sanford police to report him. Between ending his call with police and their arrival, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin outside of the townhouse he was staying at following an altercation. Zimmerman was injured in the altercation and claimed self-defense. The incident caused national outrage after Zimmerman was not charged over the shooting. The national coverage of the incident lead Sandford police to arrest Zimmerman and charge him with second-degree murder, but he was found not guilty at trial. Public outcry followed the acquittal and created an abundance of mistrust between minorities and the Sanford police. In 2014, the police shooting of Michael Brown, an African American, in Ferguson, Missouri led to widespread unrest in the town. In the years following, mass media has followed other high profile police shootings of African-Americans, often with video evidence from police body-worn cameras. Amongst 15 high-profile police shooting deaths of African-Americans, only one officer faced prison time. High-profile shooting deaths of African-Americans led to the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement. The U.S. Justice department launched the National Center for Building Community Trust and Justice in 2014. This program collects data concerning racial profiling to create change in the criminal justice system concerning implicit and explicit racial bias towards African-Americans as well as other minorities. In August 2017, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued a rare warning to the US and its leadership to \\"unequivocally and unconditionally\\" condemn racist speech and crime, following violence in Charlottesville during a rally organized by white nationalists, white supremacists, Klansmen, neo-Nazis and various right-wing militias in July. White women calling the police on blacks has become more publicized in recent years. In a 2020 article in The New York Times titled How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror, black columnist Charles M. Blow wrote, ‚Äúhistorically, white women have used the violence of white men and the institutions these men control as their own muscle. Untold numbers of lynchings were executed because white women had claimed that a black man raped, assaulted, talked to or glanced at them. This exercise in racial extremism has been dragged into the modern era through the weaponizing of 9-1-1, often by white women, to invoke the power and force of the police who they are fully aware are hostile to black men‚Äú. One such example that went viral occurred in May 2020, when a white woman called the police on a black man bird-watching in Central Park, New York. After he had asked her to put her dog on a leash (as per the rules in an area of the park to protect other wildlife), she approached him, to which he responded ‚ÄúPlease don't come close to me\\", before she yelled, \\"I'm taking a picture and calling the cops. I'm going to tell them there's an African American man threatening my life.\\" During her phone call, with the man standing a distance away from her and recording her, she spoke in an audibly distraught voice, \\"There's a man, African American, he is.. threatening me and my dog. Please send the cops immediately!\\". Other examples of white women calling the police on blacks include reporting an eight-year-old girl for selling bottles of water without a permit in San Francisco, reporting a black family barbecuing in a park in Oakland, California, blocking a black man from entering an apartment building in St. Louis, Missouri where he is a resident before calling the police, and a woman accusing a boy of groping her in a store in Brooklyn, New York, which was disproven by surveillance. On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis Police Department officer, Derek Chauvin, who forced his knee on Floyd's neck for a total of 8 minutes and 46 seconds.‚Äú8 Minutes and 46 Seconds: How George Floyd was killed in Police Custody‚Äù.

Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder, and the other three officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Floyd‚Äôs death sparked a wave of protests across the US, beginning in Minneapolis. The official postmortem report on June 1, 2020, confirmed that the death was a homicide.  Asian Americans  A World War II anti-Japanese propaganda poster utilizing the \\"Jap\\" slur and depicting the Japanese as rats, after they conquered parts of Alaska. Asian Americans, including those of East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian descent, have experienced racism since the first major groups of Chinese immigrants arrived in America. The Naturalization Act of 1790 made Asians ineligible for citizenship. First-generation immigrants, children of immigrants, and Asians adopted by non-Asian families are still impacted by discrimination. During the Industrial Revolution in the United States, labor shortages in the mining and rail industries were prevalent. Chinese immigrant labor was often used to fill this gap, most notably with the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad, leading to large-scale Chinese immigration. These Chinese immigrants were seen as taking the jobs of whites for cheaper pay, and the phrase Yellow Peril, which predicted the demise of Western Civilization as a result of Chinese immigrants, gained popularity. =Anti-Chinese legislation= In 1871, one of the largest lynchings in American history was committed against Chinese immigrants in Los Angeles, California. It would go on to become known as the Chinese massacre of 1871. The 1879 Constitution of the California prohibited the employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, as well as by businesses that were incorporated in California. Also, the 1879 constitution delegated power to local governments in California to remove Chinese people from within their borders.Article XIX of the Constitution of the State of California of 1879James Whitman, \\"Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law\\" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017), p. 35 The federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned immigration of Chinese labourers for ten years after thousands of Chinese immigrants had come to the American West. Several mob attacks against Chinese people took place, including the Rock Springs massacre of 1885 in Wyoming in which at least 28 Chinese miners were killed and 15 injured, and the Hells Canyon massacre of 1887 in Oregon where 34 Chinese miners were killed. =Anti-Asian legislation in the late 19th century= A political cartoon from 1882 ridiculing the Chinese Exclusion Act, showing a Chinese man, surrounded by benefits of Chinese immigration, being barred entry to the \\"Golden Gate of Liberty\\", while other groups, including Communists and \\"hoodlums\\", are allowed to enter. The caption reads sarcastically, \\"We must draw the line somewhere, you know.\\" The 1879 Constitution of California prohibited the employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, as well as by businesses which were incorporated in California. Also, the 1879 constitution delegated the local governments of California the power to remove Chinese people from the borders of their localities. The Chinese Exclusion Act banning immigration of Chinese people was enacted on the national level in 1882, while the immigration of people from Asian countries in addition to China was banned by the sweeping Immigration Act of 1917, also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which also banned homosexuals, people with intellectual disability, and people with an anarchist worldview. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first time that a law was passed to exclude a major ethnic group from the nation. Several massacres of Chinese people, including the Rock Springs massacre of 1885 and the Hells Canyon massacre of 1887 further exemplified deep American racist animus against Chinese people. Denver's anti-Chinese riot in 1880 Local discriminatory laws were also enacted to stifle Chinese business and job opportunities; for example, in the 1886 Supreme Court case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, a San Francisco city ordinance requiring permits for laundries (which were mostly Chinese-owned) was struck down, as it was evident the law solely targeted Chinese Americans. When the law was in effect, the city issued permits to virtually all non-Chinese permit applicants, while only granting one permit out of two hundred applications from Chinese laundry owners. When the Chinese laundries continued to operate, the city tried to fine the owners. In 1913, California, home to many Chinese immigrants, enacted an Alien Land Law, which significantly restricted land ownership by Asian immigrants, and extended it in 1920, ultimately banning virtually all land ownership by Asians. Japanese immigrants, who were unaffected by the Chinese Exclusion Act, began to enter the United States in large numbers in 1907, filling jobs that were once filled by Chinese workers. This influx also led to discrimination and President Theodore Roosevelt restricted Japanese immigration. Later, Japanese immigration was closed when Japan entered into the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 to stop issuing passports to Japanese workers intending to move to the U.S. During World War II, the Republic of China was an ally of the United States, and the federal government praised the resistance of the Chinese against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, in an attempt to reduce anti-Chinese sentiment. In 1943, the Magnuson Act was passed by Congress, repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act and reopening Chinese immigration. However, at the time, the United States was actively fighting the Empire of Japan, which was a member of the Axis powers. Anti-Japanese racism, which spiked after the attack on Pearl Harbor, was tacitly encouraged by the government, which used slurs such as \\"Jap\\" in propaganda posters and even interned Japanese Americans, citing possible security threats. American soldiers in the Pacific theater often dehumanized their enemy, leading them to mutilate Japanese war dead. The racist nature of this dehumanization is apparent in the inconsistency of the treatment of corpses in the Pacific and the European theaters. Apparently some soldiers mailed Japanese skulls home as souvenirs, while none of them mailed German or Italian skulls home. This prejudice continued to exist for some time after the end of the war, and anti- Asian racism also affected U.S. policy during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, even though Asians fought on both sides during those wars as well as during World War II. Some historians have alleged that a climate of racism, with unofficial rules like the \\"mere gook rule\\", allowed a pattern to exist in which South Vietnamese civilians were treated as if they were less than human and war crimes became common. Prior to 1965, Indian immigration to the U.S. was small and isolated, with fewer than 50,000 Indian immigrants in the country. The Bellingham riots in Bellingham, Washington, on September 5, 1907, epitomized the low tolerance in the U.S. for Indians and Hindus. While anti- Asian racism was embedded in U.S. politics and culture in the early 20th century, Indians were also racialized, with U.S. officials casting them as \\"Hindu menaces\\" and pushing for Western imperial expansion abroad. In the 1923 case, United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, the Supreme Court ruled that high caste Hindus were not \\"white persons\\" and were therefore racially ineligible for naturalized citizenship. The Court argued that the racial difference between Indians and whites was so great that the \\"great body of our people\\" would reject assimilation with Indians.Zhao, X. & Park, E.J.W. (2013). Asian Americans: An Encyclopedia of Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political History_. Greenwood. pp. 1142. It was after the Luce‚ÄìCeller Act of 1946 that a quota of 100 Indians per year could immigrate to the U.S. and become citizens. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European and Germanic groups, and as a result, it would significantly, and unintentionally, alter the demographic mix in the U.S. On the U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965, sociologist Stephen Klineberg stated the law \\"declared that Northern Europeans are a superior subspecies of the white race.\\" In 1990, Asian immigration was encouraged when nonimmigrant temporary working visas were given to help with the shortage of skilled labor within the United States. Burned buildings in Los Angeles after 1992 Los Angeles riots. Civilians, mainly Korean American, non-Korean Asian Americans and some other communities, acting as vigilantes in combating rioters and looters In modern times, Asians have been perceived as a \\"model minority\\". They are categorized as more educated and successful, and are stereotyped as intelligent and hard-working, but socially inept. Asians may experience expectations of natural intelligence and excellence from whites as well as other minorities. This has led to discrimination in the workplace, as Asian Americans may face unreasonable expectations because of this stereotype. According to the Journal of Organizational Behavior, in 2000, out of 1,218 adult Asian Americans, 92 percent of those who experienced personal discrimination believed that the unfair treatment was due to their ethnicity. These stereotypes can also obstruct career paths; because Asians are seen as better skilled in engineering, computing, and mathematics, they are often encouraged to pursue technical careers. They are also discouraged from pursuing non-technical occupations or executive occupations requiring more social interaction, since Asians are perceived to have poor social skills. In the 2000 study, forty percent of those surveyed who experienced discrimination believed that they had lost hiring or promotion opportunities. In 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported that Asians make up 10 percent of professional jobs, while 3.7 percent of them held executive, senior level, or manager positions. Other forms of discrimination against Asian Americans include racial profiling and hate crimes. The FBI noted that in 2015, 3.2 percent of all hate crimes involved anti-Asian bias. In 2016, the Seattle Police Department reported that there was a 40 percent increase in race-based crimes against Asian-Americans, both criminal and non-criminal.Kebba, Michael T. Bias Crimes and Incidents Synopsis. Seattle: Seattle Police Department Memorandum, 2016. Print. Research shows that discrimination has led to more use of informal mental health services by Asian Americans. Asian Americans who feel discriminated against also tend to smoke more. There have been widespread incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans. = Anti-Japanese sentiment and legislation =  European Americans  Various European American immigrant groups have been subjected to discrimination on the basis of their religion (see Religious discrimination in the United States and Anti-Catholicism in the United States), immigrant status (which is known as \\"Nativism\\") or ethnicity (country of origin). Philadelphia Nativist riots. New York Times, 1854 ad, reading \\"No Irish need apply.\\" In the 19th century, this was particularly true because of anti-Irish prejudice, which was based on anti-Catholic sentiment, and prejudice against the Irish as an ethnicity. This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-19th century; the large number of Irish (both Catholics and Protestants) who settled in America in the 18th century had largely (but not entirely) escaped such discrimination and eventually blended into the white American population. During the 1830s in the U.S., riots over control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labor teams whose members were from different parts of Ireland, and riots also broke out between Irish and local American work teams which were competing for construction jobs.Prince, Carl E. (1985) \\"The Great 'Riot Year': Jacksonian Democracy and Patterns of Violence in 1834.\\" Journal of the Early Republic 5(1): 1‚Äì19. examines 24 episodes including the January labor riot at the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, the New York City election riot in April, the Philadelphia race riot in August, and the Baltimore & Washington Railroad riot in November. The Native American Party, commonly called the Know Nothing movement was a political party, whose membership was limited to Protestant men, that operated on a national basis during the mid-1850s and sought to limit the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. There was widespread anti-Irish job discrimination in the United States and \\"No Irish need apply\\" signs were common.Fried, Rebecca A.

Anti-Catholic sentiment, which appeared in North America with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers in New England in the early 17th century, remained evident in the United States up to the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy, who went on to become the first Catholic U.S. president in 1961. The 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe (notably Italian Americans and Polish Americans), partly from anti-Catholic sentiment (as well as discrimination against Irish Americans), and partly from Nordicism. The primary spokesman for Nordicism was the eugenicist Madison Grant. His 1916 book, The Passing of the Great Race, or the Racial Basis of European History about Nordicism was highly influential among racial thinking and government policy making in the U.S. Several Germans in an internment camp at Fort Douglas during World War I An advocate of the U.S. immigration laws that favored Northern Europeans, the Klansman Lothrop Stoddard wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by \\"colored\\" peoples to white civilization, with his most famous book The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy in 1920. Nordicism led to the reduction in Southern European, along with Slavic Eastern European and Russian immigrants in the National Origins Formula of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924, whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans. According to the U.S. Department of State the purpose of the act was \\"to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\\". The racial term Untermensch originates from the title of Stoddard's 1922 book The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man. It was later adopted by the Nazis (and its chief racial theorist Alfred Rosenberg) from that book's German version Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen (1925). There was also discrimination against German Americans and Italian Americans due to Germany and Italy being enemy countries during World War I (Germany) and World War II (Germany and Italy). This resulted in a sharp decrease in German- American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of German in the United States following World War I, which had hitherto been significant, and the internment of German and Italian Americans during World War II; see also World War I anti-German sentiment. Beginning in World War I, German Americans were sometimes accused of having political allegiances to Germany rather than the United States.Hugo M√ºnsterberg's obituary. The Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917‚Äì18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort.The War Department: Keeper of Our Nation's Enemy Aliens During World War I by Mitchell Yockelson. 1998. Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty. The Red Cross barred individuals with German last names from joining in fear of sabotage. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched. Questions of German American loyalty increased due to events like the German bombing of Black Tom island and the U.S. entering World War I, many German Americans were arrested for refusing allegiance to the U.S. War hysteria led to the removal of German names in public, names of things such as streets,Kathleen Doane. \\"Anti-German hysteria swept Cincinnati in 1917\\" .

Schools also began to eliminate or discourage the teaching of the German language.CCNY Archival Finding Aid, p. 81. Years later during the Second World War, German Americans were once again the victims of war hysteria discrimination. Following its entry into the Second World War, the US Government interned at least 11,000 American citizens of German ancestry. The last to be released, a German-American, remained imprisoned at Ellis Island until 1948, three and a half years after the cessation of hostilities against Germany. Specific racism against other European-American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s, being replaced by a bi-racialism of black/white, as described and predicted by Lothrop Stoddard, due to numerous causes. The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non-Nordic ethnicities; the Great Migration (of African-Americans out of the South) displaced anti-white immigrant racism with anti-black racism.  Latino Americans  A rally is held for victims of Hurricane Maria in protest against the U.S. government's response to it and the Political status of Puerto Rico. Americans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as \\"Hispanic\\" or Hispanic and Latino Americans) come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. As a result, not all Latinos are distinguishable as members of a single racial minority. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), the United States annexed much of the current Southwestern region from Mexico. Mexicans who resided in that territory were subjected to discrimination. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 (this is a conservative estimate due to the fact that there was a lack of records when many reported lynchings were committed). Between 1880 and 1930, Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 people. This lynching statistic is second only to the statistic within the African American community, which suffered an average of 37.1 lynchings per 100,000 people during the same period. Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 people. Hispanic protest against California immigration policy. Todos somos ilegales ‚Äì We are all Illegals. During the Great Depression, the U.S. government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico, however, many were forcibly removed against their will. In total, up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported, approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U.S. citizens. The Zoot Suit riots were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g., Mexican-Americans) in Los Angeles in 1943. Naval servicemen who were stationed in a Latino neighborhood clashed with youths who lived in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified and erupted into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing zoot suits, a distinctive and exaggerated style of fashion which was popular among members of that age group.Richard Griswold del Castillo, \\"The Los Angeles \\"Zoot Suit Riots\\" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives,\\" Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, Vol. 16, No. 2. (Summer, 2000), pp. 367‚Äì391. For several days, the disturbances continued unchecked , and the local police even participated in them before base commanders declared downtown Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off-limits to servicemen.Arthur C.

School children of Mexican American descent were subjected to racial segregation in the public school system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved Mexican American defendants. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies. During the 1960s, Mexican American youth formed the Chicano Civil Rights Movement.  Middle Eastern and South Asian Americans  Assyrian church after it was vandalized in Detroit (2007).Although they are not Arabs and are mostly Christians, Assyrians often face a racist backlash in the US because of their Middle Eastern background. People of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States. Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were \\"white\\" immigrants as required by naturalization law. By 1923, courts had vindicated a \\"common-knowledge\\" standard, concluding that \\"scientific evidence\\", including the notion of a \\"Caucasian race\\" including Middle Easterners and many South Asians, was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a \\"performance-based\\" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.John Tehranian, \\"Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America,\\" The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 109, No. 4. (Jan. 2000), pp. 817‚Äì848. = Arab Americans = Racism against Arab Americans and racialized Islamophobia against Muslims have risen concomitantly with tensions between the American government and the Islamic world. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, discrimination and racialized violence has markedly increased against Arab Americans and many other religious and cultural groups. Scholars, including Sunaina Maira and Evelyn Alsultany, argue that in the post-September 11 climate, the markers of the racialization of Muslim Americans are cultural, political, and religious rather than phenotypic.\\"While African-Americans, Asians, and Native Americans are racialized according to phenotype, Arab- Americans are often racialized according to religion and politics. Religious racialization conflates Arabs and Islam, and consequently positions all Arabs as Muslim; represents Islam as a monolithic religion erasing diversity among Arabs and Muslims; and marks Islam as a backwards, fanatical, uncivilized, and a terroristic belief system\\" (p. 127). \\"Whereas before September 11, Arab- and Muslim-Americans were not included in discourses on race and racism in the United States, a public discourse emerged after September 11 on whether Arabs and Muslims were being treated fairly or being subjected to racism with the rise in hate crimes and government measures targeting Arabs and Muslims\\" (p. 141). \\"'Muslim' identity has certainly congealed as a marker of exclusion and marginalization, in relation to white or mainstream America, which is subjected to similar processes of racialization, and racism, that operate for racial minority groups.\\" Arab Americans in particular were most demonized after the September 11 attacks, which led to hatred towards Middle Easterners living in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world. There have been attacks against Arabs not only on the basis of their religion (Islam), but also on the basis of their ethnicity; numerous Christian Arabs have been attacked based on their appearances.Attacks on Arab Americans (PBS) In addition, other Middle Eastern peoples (Persians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Jews, Turks, Yazidis, Kurds, etc.) who are mistaken for Arabs because of perceived similarities in appearance have been collateral victims of anti-Arabism. Non-Arab and non-Muslim Middle Eastern people, as well as South Asians of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as \\"Arabs\\" and racialized in a similar manner. The case of Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a white supremacist for \\"looking like an Arab terrorist\\" (because of the turban, a requirement of Sikhism), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for \\"being Muslims\\" have achieved prominence and criticism following the September 11 attacks. Those of Middle Eastern descent who are in the United States military face racism from fellow soldiers. Army Spc Zachari Klawonn endured numerous instances of racism during his enlistment at Fort Hood, Texas. During his basic training, he was made to put cloth around his head and play the role of terrorist. His fellow soldiers had to take him down to the ground and draw guns on him. He was also called things such as \\"raghead\\", \\"sand monkey\\", and \\"Zachari bin Laden\\". According to a 2004 study, although official parameters encompass Arabs as part of the \\"white American\\" racial category, some Arab American adolescents do not identify as white. Racial profiling is a growing problem for Arab Americans following the September 11 attacks. Particularly in airports, Arab Americans are often subject to heightened security screening, pre-boarding searches and interrogations, and are sometimes denied passage \\"based solely on the belief that ethnicity or national origin increases passengers' flight risk.\\" Originally, passenger profiling was introduced in the 1960s to identify potential hijackers that fit the \\"profile\\" of a person who is \\"likely to be a terrorist.\\" However, this practice was discontinued in 1972 due to inefficiencies and was replaced by checkpoints and x-ray security. The Department Of Justice released a statement in 1997 claiming that automated passenger screenings would not have a \\"disparate impact on any group of passengers.\\" The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) believes that \\"profiling, even under the best circumstances, provides an opportunity for the prejudices and stereotypes held by law enforcement and other officials to be expressed through discriminatory application of profiles. At worst, they are simply a recipe for bigoted behavior.\\" = Jewish Americans = Protesters at the Unite the Right rally carrying Confederate flags, Gadsden flags, and a Nazi flag Antisemitism has also played a role in the history of the United States. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Jews escaped the pogroms in Europe. They boarded boats which left ports that were located on the Baltic Sea as well as ports that were located in Northern Germany, and they largely arrived at Ellis Island, New York.Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America (New York: Little, Brown & Co., 1993), 277‚Äì283. It is suggested by Leo Rosten, in his book The Joys of Yiddish, that as soon as they left their boats, they were subjected to racism by the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term kike was adopted in reference to Jews (because most of them could not write and as a result, they may have signed their immigration papers with circles ‚Äì or kikels in Yiddish).Rosten, Leo (1968) The Joys of Yiddish Efforts were also made by the Asiatic Exclusion League to bar Jewish immigrants (along with other Middle Eastern ethnic groups, like Arabs, Assyrians, and Armenians) from naturalization, nevertheless, they (along with Assyrians and Armenians) were granted US citizenship, despite being classified as Asians.\\"Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League\\" Asiatic Exclusion League. San Francisco: April 1910. Pg. 7. \\"To amend section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States be, and the same is hereby, amended by adding thereto the following: And Mongolians, Malays, and other Asiatics, except Armenians, Assyrians, and Jews, shall not be naturalized in the United States.\\" Beginning in the 1910s, Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, which objected to Jewish immigration, and often used \\"The Jewish Banker\\" caricature in its propaganda. In 1915, Leo Frank was lynched in Georgia after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death by hanging (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that \\"everyone knew the identity of the lynchers\\" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, \\"They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or ... see a man on the job and talk to him,\\" and an unidentified lyncher as saying \\"The organization of the body was more open than mysterious.\\" This event was a catalyst in the re-formation of the new Ku Klux Klan. Events in Nazi Germany also attracted attention in the United States. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the isolationists, amongst whom was Father Charles Coughlin, a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading the United States into the war.Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891‚Äì1971) By Richard Sanders, editor, Press for Conversion! He preached weekly, overtly anti-Semitic sermons and, from 1936, he began the publication of a newspaper, Social Justice, in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as those which are contained in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Mary Christine Athans, \\"A New Perspective on Father Charles E. Coughlin,\\" Church History, Vol. 56, No. 2. (June 1987), pp. 224‚Äì235, American Society of Church History A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the Nation of Islam anti-Semitic. Specifically, they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the role of Jews in the African slave trade. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) alleged that the NOI's Health Minister, Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus, an allegation that Muhammad and The Washington Post have refuted. Although Jews are often considered white by mainstream American society, the relationship between Jews and the concept of whiteness remains complex, with some of them preferring not to identify themselves as white.Seth Korelitz, \\"The Menorah Idea: From Religion to Culture, From Race to Ethnicity,\\" American Jewish History 1997 85(1): 75‚Äì100. 0164‚Äì0178Peter Novick, The Holocaust in American Life (1999); Hilene Flanzbaum, ed.

The Village Voice. XXXVIII (20). pp. 33‚Äì34. Prominent activist and rabbi Michael Lerner argues, in a 1993 Village Voice article, that \\"in America, to be 'white' means to be the beneficiary of the past 500 years of European exploration and exploitation of the rest of the world\\" and that \\"Jews can only be deemed white if there is massive amnesia on the part of non-Jews about the monumental history of anti-Semitism\\". African-American activist Cornel West, in an interview with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, has explained:  New Antisemitism  In recent years, some scholars have advanced the concept of New antisemitism, coming simultaneously from the far left, the far right, and radical Islam. This concept tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the State of Israel, and it also argues that the language of Anti-Zionism and criticism of Israel are both used to attack Jews more broadly. According to this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute these criticisms to antisemitism.Sources for the following are: * Bauer, Yehuda. , 2003, retrieved April 22, 2006. * Chesler, Phyllis.

Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism, Random House 2004, p. 272. Yehuda Bauer, Professor of Holocaust Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has argued that the concept of a \\"new antisemitism\\" is essentially false since it is in fact an alternative form of the old antisemitism of previous decades, which he believes remains latent at times but recurs whenever it is triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israel-Palestine situation; if a compromise making ground in the Arab-Israeli peace process were achieved, he believes that antisemitism would once again decline but not disappear. Noted critics of Israel, such as Noam Chomsky and Norman Finkelstein, question the extent of new antisemitism in the United States. Chomsky has written in his work Necessary Illusions that the Anti-Defamation League casts any question of pro-Israeli policy as antisemitism, conflating and muddling issues as even Zionists receive the allegation. Finkelstein has stated that supposed \\"new antisemitism\\" is a preposterous concept advanced by the ADL to combat critics of Israeli policy. On October 27, 2018, Robert D. Bowers opened fire in a synagogue in Pittsburgh with an AR-15-style assault rifle while shouting anti-Semitic racial slurs. This attack resulted in 11 dead and 6 wounded, leaving the assailant charged with 29 criminal counts, one of which was the obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel have commented on the event, condemning the attack. = Iranian Americans = A man holding a sign that reads \\"deport all Iranians\\" and \\"get the hell out of my country\\" during a protest of the Iran hostage crisis in Washington, D.C. in 1979. The November 1979 Iranian hostage crisis of the U.S. embassy in Tehran precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the new Islamic regime and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations. Since the 1980s and especially since the 1990s, it has been argued, Hollywood's depiction of Iranians has gradually shown signs of vilifying Iranians.See detailed analysis in: The U.S. Media and the Middle East: Image and Perception. Praeger, 1997; Greenwood, 1995. Hollywood network productions such as 24,Los Angeles Times: Essay: Iranians moving past negative depictions in pop culture: \\"Iranians, left outside of the 9/11 conversation, began to leak fairly seamlessly into the best and worst of pop culture. In 2003, veteran Iranian actress Shohreh Aghadashloo starred in The House of Sand and Fog, for which she became the first Iranian nominated for an Academy Award (although two years later the pendulum swung back when she played a member of a terrorist family on the hit TV show 24).\\" June 27, 2010. John Doe, On Wings of Eagles (1986), Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper (1981), and JAG almost regularly host Persian speaking villains in their story lines. = Indian Americans = In the United States, Indian Americans have sometimes been mistaken for Arabs or Muslims, and thus, many of the same prejudices which have been experienced by Arab Americans have also been experienced by Indian Americans, regardless of their actual religious or ethnic background. In the 1980s, a gang known as the Dotbusters specifically targeted Indian Americans in Jersey City, New Jersey with violence and harassment. Studies of racial discrimination, as well as stereotyping and scapegoating of Indian Americans have been conducted in recent years. In particular, racial discrimination against Indian Americans in the workplace has been correlated with Indophobia due to the rise in outsourcing/offshoring, whereby Indian Americans are blamed for US companies offshoring white-collar labor to India.Indophobia: Facts versus Fiction, Arvind Panagariya, Columbia University archives of The Economic TimesWorries about technical-job losses, discrimination , by Amy Yee, The Financial Times Ltd., 2004 According to the offices of the Congressional Caucus on India, many Indian Americans are severely concerned of a backlash, though nothing serious has taken place yet. Due to various socio-cultural reasons, implicit racial discrimination against Indian Americans largely go unreported by the Indian American community. Numerous cases of religious stereotyping of American Hindus (mainly of Indian origin) have also been documented. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been scattered incidents of Indian Americans becoming mistaken targets for hate crimes. In one example, a Sikh, Balbir Singh Sodhi, was murdered at a Phoenix gas station in a hate crime. This happened after September 11, and the murderer claimed that his turban made him think that the victim was a Middle Eastern American. In another example, a pizza deliverer was mugged and beaten in Massachusetts for \\"being Muslim\\" though the victim pleaded with the assailants that he was in fact a Hindu. In December 2012, an Indian American in New York City was pushed from behind onto the tracks at the 40th Street-Lowery Street station in Sunnyside and killed. The police arrested a woman, Erika Menendez, who admitted to the act and justified it, stating that she shoved him onto the tracks because she believed that he was \\"a Hindu or a Muslim\\" and she wanted to retaliate for the attacks on September 11, 2001.  Antiziganism  The Roma population in America has blended more-or-less seamlessly into the rest of American society. In the United States, the term \\"Gypsy\\" has come to be associated with a trade, a profession, or a lifestyle more than with the Romani ethnic/racial group. Some Americans, especially those who are self- employed in the fortune-telling and psychic reading businesses, use the term \\"Gypsy\\" to describe themselves or their enterprises, despite the fact that they have no ties to the Roma people. This practice is motivated by misperceptions and ignorance regarding the term rather than any expression of bigotry against Romani people which is called anti-ziganism.Sutherland, Anne (1986). Gypsies: The Hidden Americans. Waveland Press. p. 86.  Consequences  Historian Matthew White estimates that 3.3 million more non-white people died from 1900 up to the 1960s than they would have if they had died at the same rate as white people. = Developmental = Using The Schedule of Racist Events (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination, Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and as a result, it is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms.The Schedule of Racist Events: A Measure of Racial Discrimination and a Study of Its Negative Physical and Mental Health Consequences Journal of Black Psychology, Vol. 22, No. 2, 144‚Äì168 (1996) A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being. The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term \\"stereotype threat.\\" Quite similarly, another example of the psychosocial consequences of discrimination have been observed in a study sampling Mexican-origin participants in Fresno, California. It was found that perceived discrimination is correlated with depressive symptoms, especially for those less acculturated in the United States, like Mexican immigrants and migrants. Along the vein of somatic responses to discrimination, Kennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites. Some researchers also suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that segregation would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of racial disparities in mortality. Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation. Researchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, mortality risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death. Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang et al. 1998). Stephanie A. Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and access to health insurance and medical providers.THE CONCEPT OF NEIGHBORHOOD IN HEALTH AND MORTALITY RESEARCH Moreover, segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US. Much research has been done on the effects of racism on adults, but racism and discrimination also affects children and teens. From infancy to adolescence, studies document a children's growth in understanding of race from being aware of race to later understanding how race and prejudice affects their life, the lives of others‚Äô, and society as a whole. The comprehensive literature review of 214 published articles with key words related to the topic, such as discrimination, racism, and prejudice for adolescents aged 10-20 years (Benner et al., 2008) highlighted a link between teens' experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination and \\"their socioemotional distress, academic success, and risky health behaviors‚Äù. This study chose larger sample sized and peer reviewed studies, over smaller sampled and non-peer reviewed studies. In this review, researchers showed links between racial discrimination and lower socioemotional, academic, and behavioral outcomes. The socioemotional variable included depression, internalized symptoms, self-esteem, and positive well being; academics included achievement, engagement, and motivation; and behavioral outcomes included externalized behaviors, substance abuse, deviant peer associations, and risky sexual behaviors. Researchers examined the links between discrimination and other demographic variables such as race, age, and country of residence. When looking at the impact of race/ethnicity, results show that Asian and Latino youth show greater socioemotional distress and Latino youth show lower academic outcomes. Younger teens (10 to 13 years) experience more socioemotional distress than those in middle or late teens. Furthermore, when looking at county of residence, teens in the United States have a much stronger link to socioemotional distress than other countries included in the review. As early as 1866, the Civil Rights Act provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The Civil Rights Act of 1871 applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited. = Societal =  Schemas and stereotypes  This racist postcard from the 1900s shows the casual denigration of black women. It states \\"I know you're not particular to a fault / Though I'm not sure you'll never be sued for assault / You're so fond of women that even a wench / Attracts your gross fancy despite her strong stench\\" Media Popular culture (songs, theater) for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of blackface. Directly related to this was the institution of minstrelsy. Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat, dark-skinned \\"mammy\\" and the irrational, hypersexual male \\"buck\\". In recent years increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that rap music videos commonly utilize scantily clothed African-American performers posing as thugs or pimps. The NAACP and the National Congress of Black Women also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television. Julian Bond said that in a segregated society, people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music.Felicia R. Lee, \\"Protesting Demeaning Images in Media\\" New York Times November 5, 2007Marissa Newhall, \\"Channeling Their Discontent, 500 Gather at Executive's D.C. Home to Protest Stereotypes,\\" Washington Post, September 16, 2007 In 1899 Uncle Sam balances his new possessions which are depicted as \\"savage\\" children. The figures are Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Cuba, Philippines and \\"Ladrone Is.\\" (the Mariana Islands). In a similar vein, activists protested against the BET show, Hot Ghetto Mess, which satirizes the culture of working- class African-Americans. The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to We Got to Do Better. It is understood that representations of minorities in the media have the ability to reinforce or change stereotypes. For example, in one study, a collection of white subjects were primed by a comedy skit either showing a stereotypical or neutral portrayal of African- American characters. Participants were then required to read a vignette describing an incident of sexual violence, with the alleged offender either white or black, and assign a rating for perceived guilt. For those shown the stereotypical African-American character, there was a significantly higher guilt rating for black alleged offender in the subsequent vignette, in comparison to the other conditions. While schemas have an overt societal consequence, the strong development of them have lasting effect on recipients. Overall, it is found that strong in-group attitudes are correlated with academic and economic success. In a study analyzing the interaction of assimilation and racial-ethnic schemas for Hispanic youth found that strong schematic identities for Hispanic youth undermined academic achievement. Additional stereotypes attributed to minorities continue to influence societal interactions. For example, a 1993 Harvard Law Review article states that Asian-Americans are commonly viewed as submissive, as a combination of relative physical stature and Western comparisons of cultural attitudes. Furthermore, Asian-Americans are depicted as the model minority, unfair competitors, foreigners, and indistinguishable. These stereotypes can serve to dehumanize Asian-Americans and catalyze hostility and violence.  Formal discrimination  Formal discrimination against minorities has been present throughout American history. Leland T. Saito, Associate Professor of Sociology and American Studies & Ethnicity at the University of Southern California, writes, \\"Political rights have been circumscribed by race, class and gender since the founding of the United States, when the right to vote was restricted to white men of property. Throughout the history of the United States race has been used by whites ‚Äì a category that has also shifted through time ‚Äì for legitimizing and creating difference and social, economic and political exclusion.\\"Leland T. Saito (1998). \\"Race and Politics: Asian Americans, Latinos, and Whites in a Los Angeles Suburb\\". p. 154. University of Illinois Press Within education, a survey of black students in sixteen majority white universities found that four of five African-Americans reported some form of racial discrimination. For example, in February 1988, the University of Michigan enforced a new anti discrimination code following the distribution of fliers saying blacks \\"don't belong in classrooms, they belong hanging from trees\\". Other forms of reported discrimination were refusal to sit next to black in lecture, ignored input in class settings, and informal segregation. While the penalties are imposed, the psychological consequences of formal discrimination can still manifest. Black students, for example, reported feelings of heightened isolation and suspicion. Furthermore, studies have shown that academic performance is stunted for black students with these feelings as a result of their campus race interactions.  Minority-minority racism  Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of power in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power so it can be imposed upon others.For example, Catherine A. Hansman, Leon Spencer, Dale Grant, Mary Jackson, \\"Beyond Diversity: Dismantling Barriers in Education,\\" Journal of Instructional Psychology, March 1999 Yet discrimination and racism has also been noted between racially marginalized groups. For example, there has been ongoing violence between African American and Mexican American gangs, particularly in Southern California.Andrew Blankstein And Joel Rubin. L.A.'s top cops at odds: William Bratton, Lee Baca disagree on role of race in gang violence. Los Angeles Times, June 13, 2008. There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against Mexican Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by African Americans, and vice versa. According to gang experts and law enforcement agents, a longstanding race war between the Mexican Mafia and the Black Guerilla Family, a rival African American prison gang, has generated such intense racial hatred among Mexican Mafia leaders, or shot callers, that they have issued a \\"green light\\" on all blacks. This amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia. There have been several significant riots in California prisons where Mexican American inmates and African Americans have targeted each other particularly, based on racial reasons. Conflict has also been noted between recent immigrant groups and their established ethnic counterparts within the United States. Rapidly-growing communities of African and Caribbean immigrants have come into conflict with American blacks. The amount of interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and American blacks is, ironically, debatable. One can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation are not ordinarily based on skin color, but are instead based on shared or common, cultural experiences and beliefs.  Interpersonal discrimination  In a manner that defines interpersonal discrimination in the United States, Darryl Brown of the Virginia Law Review states that while \\"our society has established a consensus against blatant, intentional racism in the decades since Brown v Board of Education and it has also developed a sizeable set of legal remedies to address it\\", our legal system \\"ignores the possibility that 'race' is structural or interstitial, that it can be the root of injury even when it is not traceable to a specific intention or action\\" Unlike formal discrimination, interpersonal discrimination is often not an overt or deliberate act of racism. For example, in an incident regarding a racial remark which was made by a professor at Virginia Law, a rift was created by conflicting definitions of racism. For the students who defended the professor's innocence, \\"racism was defined as an act of intentional maliciousness\\". Yet for African Americans, racism was broadened to a detrimental influence on \\"the substantive dynamics of the classroom\\". As an effect, it is argued that the \\"daily repetition of subtle racism and subordination in the classroom can ultimately be, for African Americans, even more reductive of stress, anxiety and alienation than blatant racist acts can be.\\" Moreover, the attention which is given to these acts of discrimination diverts energy from academics, becoming a distraction that white students do not generally face.  Ethnic-racial socialization  Ethnic-racial socialization refers to the transfer of knowledge about various aspects of race and/ or ethnicity through generations. Parents of color use ethnic-racial socialization to transfer cultural knowledge to their children in order to protect them from potential biases which they may face as a result of their ethnicity and/or race. However, how parents choose to socialize their children regarding issues of ethnicity and race may affect children differently. For example, when parent's socialization efforts focus on positive aspects of their race/ethnicity, children of color tend to report higher self-esteem. On the other hand, if the focus of socialization mainly revolves around mistrust about interracial or inter-ethnic relations, children‚Äôs self-concept, or how children view themselves might suffer. Promotion of socialization that centers on mistrust is especially harmful when parents present it without also teaching positive coping skills. Wang et al. (2020) conducted a meta-analytic review of 334 articles examining the effects of ethnic-racial socialization on children of color‚Äôs psychosocial adjustment. Researchers evaluated the stage of children‚Äôs development in which the effects of ethnic-racial socialization would be most prominent. Their findings using their systematic review process showed a positive relationship between parental ethnic-racial socialization and psychosocial well-being measures, including self-perception, confidence, and interpersonal relationships. The effects of age varied based on the psychosocial well-being measure a study used. Results showed that the link between positive self-perception and ethnic-racial socialization was most effective when it occurred in childhood and early adolescence. On the other hand, children who reported positive relationships between their interpersonal relationships and ethnic-racial socialization showed this paper in middle to late adolescence. The effects of ethnic-racial socialization also varied based on children's race/ethnicity. Self-perception and ethnic-racial socialization are related more positively among African Americans, suggesting that parents used ethnic-racial socialization to buffer against the deep-rooted stigma and biases African Americans face in the United States. Contrary to the experiences of African Americans, ethnic-racial socialization was related to low self-perception among Asian Americans. Extensive research is required to better understand the connection of ethnic-racial socialization for Asian American children‚Äôs psychosocial well-being. In order to better understand the effects of ethnic-racial socialization and psychological development, research should take into account known moderating factors similar to stereotype threat. It is important to note that the research findings were correlational and as such does not imply causality. = Institutional racism = Institutional racism is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and the established institutions in society disadvantage some racial groups, although not with an overtly discriminatory mechanism.What is Institutional and Structural Racism? ERASE RACISM There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals). In his article, Peter Kaufman describes three instances in which institutional racism has contributed to current views of race. These are: # The mis- and Missing Education of Race, in which he describes problems the educational system has in discussing \\"slavery, race, racism, and topics such as white privilege\\". He goes on to say that schools are still segregated based on class and race, which also contributes to race relations # Residential Racial Segregation. According to Kaufman, the reason that schools are still segregated is due to towns and cities being largely segregated still. # Media Monsters. This describes the role in which the media has in the portrayal of race. Mass media tends to play on \\"depictions of racialized stereotypes in the mass media [which are] ubiquitous, and such caricaturized images shape our perceptions of various racial groups\\". An example of this is the stereotyping of Blacks as criminals.*  Immigration  Access to United States citizenship was restricted by race, beginning with the Naturalization Act of 1790 which excluded \\"non-whites\\" from citizenship. Institutionalized prejudice existed against white practitioners of Roman Catholicism who immigrated from countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy and France.Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center Other efforts include the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 National Origins Act.Immigration Act of 1924 HistoricalDocuments.com The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. By limiting the immigration of non-Northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, the purpose of the 1924 act was \\"to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\\". Following the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the racist preference for white immigrants which dated back to the 18th century was ended, and in response to this change, white nationalism grew in the United States as the conservative movement developed in mainstream society.\\"Black Politics are in a Black Hole\\", Newsday (New York, January 14, 2005) Political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argues that it developed in reaction to the perceived decline in the essence of America's identity, an identity which was believed to be European, Anglo-Saxon Protestant and English-speaking.\\"Bush and Kerry Show Opposing Faces of Two Different Americas. Business Day (South Africa: October 21, 2004) In conjunction with immigration reform in the late 1980s (the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986), IRCA-related instances of discriminatory behavior towards Hispanics with regard to employment have been documented within the United States. Because the measure made it unlawful to hire immigrants to work in the United States without authorization, avoidant treatment of \\"foreign- appearing workers\\" increased when employers avoided the risk of sanctions by bypassing the required record-keeping process. Nazi Germany's use of the American racist model Hitler and other Nazis praised America's system of institutional racism and believed that it was the model which should be followed in their Reich. In particular, they believed that it was the model for the expansion of German territory into the territories of other nations and the elimination of their indigenous inhabitants, as well as the model for the implementation of racist immigration laws which banned some races, and laws which denied full citizenship to blacks, which they also wanted to implement against Jews. Hitler's book Mein Kampf extolled America as the only contemporary example of a country with racist (\\"v√∂lkisch\\") citizenship statutes in the 1920s, and Nazi lawyers made use of American models when they crafted their own laws in Nazi Germany. U.S. citizenship laws and anti- miscegenation laws directly inspired the two principal Nuremberg Laws‚Äîthe Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. Establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany, Hitler admiringly wrote: \\"The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races.\\"\\"American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners\\". Times of Israel. Retrieved August 1, 2019  Sectors of American society  = Business = A 2014 meta-analysis of racial discrimination in product markets found extensive evidence of minority applicants being quoted higher prices for products. A 1995 study found that car dealers \\"quoted significantly lower prices to white males than to black or female test buyers using identical, scripted bargaining strategies.\\" A 2013 study found that eBay sellers of iPods received 21 percent more offers if a white hand held the iPod in the photo than a black hand. A 2014 study in the Journal of Economic Growth found that anti-black violence and terrorism, as well as segregation laws, reduced the economic activity and innovation of African Americans. African-Americans have historically faced discrimination in terms of getting access to credit. = Criminal justice system = Racial disparities in the share of prisoners, police officers, people shot by police, and judges in the United States in the late 2010s Research suggests that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas which are populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in a disproportionately high number of crime suspects who are members of racial minority groups.Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2008/09, p. 8., 22 Research also suggests that discrimination is practiced by the judicial system, which contributes to the fact that a high number of convictions and unfavorable sentences are imposed on members of racial minority groups. A 2012 study found that \\"(i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member.\\" Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where \\"black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences.\\" In-group bias has also been observed when it comes to traffic citations, because black and white cops are more likely to cite out-groups. A 2014 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that 9% of the black-white gap in sentencing could not be accounted for. The elimination of unexplained sentencing disparities would reduce \\"the level of black men who are in federal prisons by 8,000‚Äì11,000 men [out of a black male prison population of 95,000] and save $230‚Äì$320 million in direct costs per year.\\" The majority of the unexplained sentencing disparity appears to occur at the point when prosecutors decide to bring charges which carry \\"mandatory minimum\\" sentences. A 2018 paper by Alma Cohen and Crystal Yang of Harvard Law School found \\"that Republican-appointed judges give substantially longer prison sentences to black offenders versus observably similar non-black offenders compared to Democratic-appointed judges who serve within the same district court.\\" A 2018 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that bail judges in Miami and Philadelphia were racially biased against black defendants, because white defendants had higher rates of pretrial misconduct than black defendants did. A 2018 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that black and Hispanic men were far more likely to be killed by police than white men were. A 2019 study by Roland G. Fryer, Jr. found that while there are no racial differences in the lethal use of police force, blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely to experience non-lethal use of force. A 2019 paper by Princeton University political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks who were included in Fryer's data are not similar. Reports by the Department of Justice have also found that police officers in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, systemically stop, search (in some cases strip-search) and harass black residents. A January 2017 report by the DOJ also found that the Chicago Police Department had \\"unconstitutionally engaged in a pattern of excessive and deadly force\\" and the report also found that the police \\"have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.\\" A 2018 study found that police officers more likely to use lethal force on blacks. A 2019 study in the Journal of Politics found that police officers were more likely to use lethal force on blacks, but that this \\"most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force.\\" A 2019 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives are more likely to be killed by police than whites, and that Latino men are more likely to be killed than white men. According to the study, \\"for young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death.\\" A separate Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study found that there were no racial disparities in police shootings by white police; the findings of the study were disputed by Princeton University scholars who argued that the study's method and dataset made it impossible for the authors to reach that conclusion. The authors of the original PNAS study corrected their article following the criticism by the Princeton scholars. A study by Texas A&M; University economists, which rectified some problems of selection bias identified in the literature above, found that white police officers were more likely to use force and guns than black police, and that white officers were five times as likely to use gun force in predominantly black neighborhoods. A 2020 American Political Science Review study estimated that 39% of uses of force by police against blacks and Hispanics in New York City was racially discriminatory. A 2020 study in the journal Nature found that black drivers were stopped more often than white drivers, and that the threshold by which police decided to search black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for whites (judging by the rate at which contraband was found in searches). In criminal sentencing, medium to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans. When a white victim is involved, those with more \\"black\\" features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment. A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research experiment found that law students, economics students and practicing lawyers who watched 3D Virtual Reality videos of court trials (where the researchers altered the race of the defendants) showed a racial bias against minorities. According to a 2011 ProPublica analysis, \\"whites are nearly four times as likely as minorities to win a pardon, even when the type of crime and severity of sentence are taken into account.\\" A 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that blacks were \\"3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession,\\" even though \\"blacks and whites use drugs, including marijuana, at similar rates.\\" A 2014 study on the application of the death penalty in Connecticut over the period 1973‚Äì2007 found \\"that minority defendants who kill white victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities... There is also strong and statistically significant evidence that minority defendants who kill whites are more likely to end up with capital sentences than comparable cases with white defendants.\\" A 2016 analysis by the New York Times \\"of tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York.\\" Blacks and Latinos were sent more frequently to solitary and held there for longer durations than whites. The New York Times analysis found that the disparities were the greatest for violations where the prison guards had much discretion, such as disobeying orders, but smaller for violations that required physical evidence, such as possessing contraband. A 2016 report by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites. Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first- degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases and 30 percent of battery cases. For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences. A 2017 report by the Marshall Project found that killings of black men by whites were far more likely to be deemed \\"justifiable\\" than killings by any other combination of races. A 2017 report by the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) found, \\"after controlling for a wide variety of sentencing factors\\" (such as age, education, citizenship, weapon possession and prior criminal history), that \\"black male offenders received sentences on average 19.1 percent longer than similarly situated White male offenders.\\" A 2018 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that tall young black men are especially likely to receive unjustified attention by law enforcement. The authors furthermore found a \\"causal link between perceptions of height and perceptions of threat for Black men, particularly for perceivers who endorse stereotypes that Black people are more threatening than White people.\\" A 2018 study in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics found that judges gave longer sentences, in particular to black defendants, after their favorite team lost a home game. Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men. The study found that whites who were searched were more likely to carry contraband than blacks and Hispanics. A 2018 study in the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies found that law enforcement officers in Texas who could charge shoplifters with two types of crimes (one more serious, one less so) due to a vaguely worded statute were more likely to charge blacks and Hispanics with the more serious crime. A 2019 study, which made use of a dataset of the racial makeup of every U.S. sheriff over a 25-year period, found that \\"ratio of Black‚Äêto‚ÄêWhite arrests is significantly higher under White sheriffs\\" and that the effects appear to be \\"driven by arrests for less‚Äêserious offenses and by targeting Black crime types.\\" A 2019 audit study found that lawyers are less likely to take on clients with black-sounding names than white-sounding names. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that facial-recognition systems were substantially more likely to misidentify the faces of racial minorities. Some ethnic groups, such as Asian-Americans and African-American, were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men. = Education = In 1954, Brown vs. the Board of Education ruled that integrated, equal schools be accessible to all children unbiased to skin color. Currently in the United States, not all state funded schools are equally funded. Schools are funded by the \\"federal, state, and local governments\\" while \\"states play a large and increasing role in education funding.\\" \\"Property taxes support most of the funding that local government provides for education.\\" Schools located in lower income areas receive a lower level of funding and schools located in higher income areas receiving greater funding for education all based on property taxes. The U.S. Department of Education reports that \\"many high- poverty schools receive less than their fair share of state and local funding, leaving students in high-poverty schools with fewer resources than schools attended by their wealthier peers.\\" The U.S. Department of Education also reports this fact affects \\"more than 40% of low-income schools.\\" Children of color are much more likely to suffer from poverty than white children. A 2015 study using correspondence tests \\"found that when considering requests from prospective students seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions.\\" Through affirmative action, elite colleges consider a broader range of experiences for minority applicants. A 2016 study in the journal PNAS found that blacks and Hispanics were systemically underrepresented in education-programs for gifted children where teachers and parents referred students to those programs; when a universal screening program based on IQ was used to refer students, the disparity was reduced significantly. The phrase \\"brown paper bag test,\\" also known as a paper bag party, along with the \\"ruler test\\" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.Kerr, A. E. (2006). The paper bag principle: Class, colorism, and rumor in the case of black Washington, DC. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press. Spike Lee's film School Daze satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities.Spike Lee, \\"School Daze,\\" 40 Acres & A Mule Filmworks, Columbia Pictures Corporation Along with the \\"paper bag test,\\" guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the \\"comb test\\" and \\"pencil test,\\" which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the \\"flashlight test,\\" which tested a person's profile to make sure their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race. A 2013 study used spectrophotometer readings to quantify skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those having darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin. This precise and repeatable test of skin color revealed that white women experience skin color discrimination in education at levels consistent with African-Americans. White men are not affected in this way. In August 2020, the US Justice Department argued that Yale University discriminated against Asian candidates on the basis of their race, a charge the university denied. = Health = A 2019 review of the literature in the Annual Review of Public Health found that structural racism, cultural racism, and individual-level discrimination are \\"a fundamental cause of adverse health outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities and racial/ethnic inequities in health.\\" A 1999 study found that doctors treat black and white patients differently, even when their medical files were statistically identical. When shown patient histories and asked to make judgments about heart disease, the doctors were much less likely to recommend cardiac catheterization (a helpful procedure) to black patients. A 2015 study found that pediatricians were more likely to undertreat appendicitis pain in black children than white children. A 2017 study found that medical staff treating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries perceived black collegiate athletes as having higher pain tolerance than white athletes. A study by University of Toronto and Ohio State University economists found substantial evidence of racial discrimination against black veterans in terms of medical treatment and awarding of disability pensions in the late 19th and early 20th century; the discrimination was substantial enough to account for nearly the entire black- white mortality gap in the period. A 2019 study in Science found that one widely used algorithm to assess health risks falsely concluded that \\"Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients\\", thus leading health care providers to provide lower levels of care for black patients. A 2018 ProPublica analysis found that African Americans and Native Americans were underrepresented in clinical trials for new drugs. Fewer than 5% of patients were African-American, even though they make up 13.4% of the total US population. African-Americans were even underrepresented in trials involving drugs intended for diseases that disproportionately affect African-Americans. As a result, African-Americans who had exhausted all other treatments have weaker access to experimental treatments. Studies have argued that there are racial disparities in how media and politicians act when faced with drug addiction where the victims are primarily black rather than white, citing the examples of how society responded differently to the crack epidemic than the opioid epidemic. There are major racial differences in access to health care as well as major racial differences in the quality of the health care which is provided to people. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: \\"over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same quality of care as whites\\". The key differences which they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate insurance, poor service, and reluctance to seek care. A history of government- sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Study has left a legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.\\"The History of Black 'Paranoia, ch. 3 of Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press, London: Verso, 1998. Inequalities in health care may also reflect a systemic bias in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed to members of different ethnic groups. A University of Edinburgh Professor of Public Health, Raj Bhopal, writes that the history of racism in science and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and he warns of dangers that need to be avoided in the future. A Harvard Professor of Social Epidemiology contended that much modern research supported the assumptions which were needed to justify racism. She writes that racism underlies unexplained inequities in health care, including treatments for heart disease, renal failure, bladder cancer, and pneumonia. Bhopal writes that these inequalities have been documented in various studies and there are consistent findings that black Americans receive less health care than white Americans‚Äîparticularly where this involves expensive new technology. The University of Michigan Health study found in 2010 that black patients in pain clinics received 50% of the amount of drugs that other patients who were white received. Black pain in medicine links to the racial disparities between pain management and racial bias on behalf of the health professional. In 2011, Vermont organizers took a proactive stand against racism in their communities to defeat the biopolitical struggles faced on a daily basis. The first and only universal health care law was passed in the state. Two local governments in the US have issued declarations stating that racism constitutes a public health emergency: the Milwaukee County, Wisconsin executive in May 2019, and the Cleveland City Council, in June 2020. = Housing and land = A 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of racial discrimination in the American housing market. Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties. Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remains significant. A 2003 study found \\"evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood (redlining). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas (steering); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination).\\" Historically, there was extensive and long-lasting racial discrimination against African-Americans in the housing and mortgage markets in the United States, as well as against black farmers whose numbers declined massively in post-WWII America due to anti-black local and federal policy. According to a 2019 analysis by University of Pittsburgh economists, blacks faced a two-fold penalty due to the racially segregated housing market: rental prices increased in blocks when they underwent racial transition whereas home values declined in neighborhoods that blacks moved into. A report by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development where the department sent African-Americans and whites to look at apartments found that African-Americans were shown fewer apartments to rent and houses for sale. A 2017 study found that \\"that applications [for Airbnb housing] from guests with distinctively African American names are 16 percent less likely to be accepted relative to identical guests with distinctively white names.\\" A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities \\"created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity.\\" However, \\"when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s\\" whites started \\"lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances.\\" As a result, cities passed ordinances which \\"prohibited members of the majority racial group on a given city block from selling or renting property to members of another racial group\\" between 1909 and 1917. A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining‚Äîthe practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods‚Äîhad a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010. Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates). Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned. A 2019 analysis estimated that predatory housing contracts targeting African- Americans in Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s cost black families between $3 billion and $4 billion in wealth. A 2017 study in Research & Politics found that white supporters of Donald Trump became less likely to approve of federal housing assistance when they were shown an image of a black man. A 2018 study in the American Sociological Review found that housing market professionals (real estate agents, housing developers, mortgage appraisers and home value appraisers) held derogatory racial views about black and Latino individuals and neighborhoods whereas white individuals and neighborhoods were beneficiaries of widely shared, positive racial beliefs. A 2018 experimental study by University of Illinois and Duke University economists found that real estate agents and housing providers systematically recommended homes in neighborhoods with higher poverty rates, greater pollution, higher crime rates, fewer college educated families, and fewer skilled workers to minority individuals who had all the same characteristics as white individuals except ethnic differences. A 2018 study in the American Political Science Review found that white voters in areas which experienced massive African-American population growth between 1940 and 1960 were more likely to vote for California Proposition 14 (1964) which sought to enshrine legal protections for landlords and property owners who discriminated against \\"colored\\" buyers and renters. A 2018 study in the Journal of Politics found extensive evidence of discrimination against blacks and Hispanics in the New York City rental market. A 2018 study in the journal Regional Science and Urban Economics found that there was discrimination against blacks and Arab males in the U.S. rental market. A 2018 study in the Journal of Regional Science found that \\"black households pay more for identical housing in identical neighborhoods than their white counterparts... In neighborhoods with the smallest fraction white, the premium is about 0.6%. In neighborhoods with the largest fraction white, it is about 2.4%.\\" = Labor market = Several meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the American labor market. A 2017 meta-analysis found \\"no change in the levels of discrimination against African Americans since 1989, although we do find some indication of declining discrimination against Latinos.\\" A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests ‚Äì tests where identical CVs for stereotypically black and white names were sent to employers ‚Äì in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North America. These correspondence tests showed that equivalent minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates. A study that examine the job applications of actual people provided with identical r√©sum√©s and similar interview training showed that African-American applicants with no criminal record were offered jobs at a rate as low as white applicants who had criminal records. A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found evidence of racial bias in how CVs were evaluated. A 2020 study found that there is not only discrimination towards minorities in callback rates in audit studies, but that the discrimination gets more severe after the callbacks in terms of job offers. Research suggests that light-skinned African American women have higher salaries and greater job satisfaction than dark-skinned women. Being \\"too black\\" has recently been acknowledged by the U.S. Federal courts in an employment discrimination case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In Etienne v. Spanish Lake Truck & Casino Plaza, LLC the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, determined that an employee who was told on several occasions that her manager thought she was \\"too black\\" to do various tasks, found that the issue of the employee's skin color rather than race itself, played a key role in an employer's decision to keep the employee from advancing. A 2018 study found evidence suggesting discrimination towards immigrants with darker skin colors. A 2019 experimental study found that there was a bias against blacks, Latinos and women in hirings of postdocs in the fields of biology and physics. A 2008 study found that black service providers receive lower tips than white service providers. Research shows that \\"ban the box\\" (the removal of the check box asking job applicants if they have criminal records) leads employers to discriminate against young, black low-skilled applicants, possibly because employers simply assume these applicants have checkered pasts when they are not able to confirm it. = Media = A 2017 report by Travis L. Dixon (of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that major media outlets tended to portray black families as dysfunctional and dependent while white families were portrayed as stable. These portrayals may give the impression that poverty and welfare are primarily black issues. According to Dixon, this can reduce public support for social safety programs and lead to stricter welfare requirements. A 2018 study found that media portrayals of Muslims were substantially more negative than for other religious groups (even when controlling for relevant factors). A 2019 study described media portrayals of minority women in crime news stories as based on \\"outdated and harmful stereotypes.\\" African Americans who possess a lighter skin complexion and \\"European features,\\" such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter-skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features. A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that features animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances. Concerning African American males in the media, darker-skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men. Colorism was and still is very much evident in the media. An example of this is shown in the minstrel shows that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in black face portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint to and over lined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people. When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals. White people wanted to keep this narrative going that black people were forever in debt to them because they essentially rescued blacks from themselves and made them humans instead of savages. This is seen in the \\"mammy\\" role that black women often played. The highlights of this role included black women being the loyal servant to the master and taking care of and loving his kids more than her own. Even though black people were allowed to be on TV, they still couldn't be too black. They had to pass the color tests and if they were dark, they were usually playing a humiliating role. That trend is something that follows into present day especially for women. There is a huge absence of dark black women in the media and when they are shown, they are typically portraying the angry black woman stereotype but have a light-skinned character to balance them out. Darker women are rarely the protagonist that isn't troubled by drugs, or caught up in the legal system. = Politics = A 2011 study found that white state legislators of both political parties were less likely to respond to constituents with African- American names. A 2013 study found that in response to e-mail correspondence from a putatively black alias, \\"nonblack legislators were markedly less likely to respond when their political incentives to do so were diminished, black legislators typically continued to respond even when doing so promised little political reward. Black legislators thus appear substantially more intrinsically motivated to advance blacks' interests.\\" Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans. Voter ID laws have brought on accusations of racial discrimination. In a 2014 review by the Government Accountability Office of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout whereas two studies found no significant impact. Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups. Studies have also analyzed racial differences in ID requests rates. A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs. Precinct differences also confound the data as black and Hispanic voters tended to vote at black and Hispanic- majority precincts. A 2010 study of the 2006 midterm election in New Mexico found that Hispanics were more likely to incur ID requests while early voters, women, and non-Hispanics were less likely to incur requests. A 2009 study of the 2006 midterm election nationwide found that 47% of white voters reported being asked to show photo identification at the polls, compared with 54% of Hispanics and 55% of African Americans.\\" Very few were however denied the vote as a result of voter identification requests. A 2015 study found that turnout among blacks in Georgia was generally higher since the state began enforcing its strict voter ID law. A 2016 study by University of California, San Diego researchers found that voter ID laws \\"have a differentially negative impact on the turnout of Hispanics, Blacks, and mixed-race Americans in primaries and general elections.\\" Research by University of Oxford economist Evan Soltas and Stanford political scientist David Broockman suggests that voters act upon racially discriminatory tastes. A 2018 study in Public Opinion Quarterly found that whites, in particular those who had racial resentment, largely attributed Obama's success among African-Americans to his race, and not his characteristics as a candidate and the political preferences of African- Americans. A 2018 study in the journal American Politics Research found that white voters tended to misperceive political candidates from racial minorities as being more ideologically extreme than objective indicators would suggest; this adversely affected the electoral chances for those candidates. A 2018 study in the Journal of Politics found that \\"when a white candidate makes vague statements, many [nonblack] voters project their own policy positions onto the candidate, increasing support for the candidate. But they are less likely to extend black candidates the same courtesy... In fact, black male candidates who make ambiguous statements are actually punished for doing so by racially prejudiced voters.\\" A 2018 study found evidence of racial-motivated reasoning as voters assessed President Barack Obama's economic performance. The study found that \\"Whites attributed more responsibility to Obama under negative economic conditions (i.e., blame) than positive economic conditions (i.e., credit)... Whites attributed equal responsibility to the President and governors for negative economic conditions, but gave more responsibility to governors than Obama for positive conditions. Whites also gave governors more responsibility for state improvements than they gave Obama for national ones.\\" A 2018 study examining \\"all 24 African American challengers (non-incumbents) from 2000 to 2014 to white challengers from the same party running in the same state for the same office around the same time\\" found \\"that white challengers are about three times more likely to win and receive about 13 percentage points more support among white voters. These estimates hold when controlling for a number of potential confounding factors and when employing several statistical matching estimators.\\" A 2019 study found that whites are less supportive of welfare when they are told that blacks are the majority of recipients (as opposed to whites). However, when informed that most welfare recipients eventually gain jobs and leave the welfare program, this racial bias disappears. An analysis by MIT political scientist Regina Bateson found that Americans engage in strategic discrimination against racial minority candidates out of a belief that they are less electable than white male candidates: \\"In the abstract, Americans consider white men more \\"electable\\" than equally qualified black and female candidates. Additionally, concerns about winning the votes of white men can cause voters to rate black and female Democratic candidates as less capable of beating Donald Trump in 2020.\\" A 2019 paper found, using smartphone data, that voters in predominantly black neighborhoods waited far longer at polling places than voters in white neighborhoods. It is argued that the racial coding of concepts like crime and welfare has been used to strategically influence public political views. Racial coding is implicit; it incorporates racially primed language or imagery in order to allude to racial attitudes and thinking. For example, in the context of domestic policy, it is argued that Ronald Reagan implied that linkages existed between concepts like \\"special interests\\" and \\"big government\\" and ill-perceived minority groups in the 1980s, using the conditioned negativity which existed toward the minority groups in order to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns. In a study which analyzes how Spolitical ads prime attitudes, Valentino compares the voting responses of participants after they are exposed to the narration of a George W. Bush advertisement which is paired with three different types of visuals which contain different embedded racial cues in order to create three conditions: neutral, race comparison, and undeserving blacks. For example, as the narrator states \\"Democrats want to spend your tax dollars on wasteful government programs\\", the video shows an image of a black woman and her child in an office setting. Valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies, like opposition to affirmative action and welfare spending. Ian Haney L√≥pez, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, refers to this phenomenon as dog- whistle politics, which, he argues, has pushed middle class white Americans to vote against their economic self-interest in order to punish \\"undeserving minorities\\" which, they believe, are receiving too much public assistance at their expense. According to L√≥pez, conservative middle-class whites, convinced that minorities are the enemy by powerful economic interests, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime, but inadvertently they also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, busting unions, cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas which they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.Full Show: Ian Haney L√≥pez on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I.

A book released by the former attorney of Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, in September 2020, Disloyal: A Memoir described Trump of routinely referring to Black leaders of foreign nations with racial insults, and that he was consumed with hatred for Barack Obama. Cohen in the book explained that ‚Äúas a rule, Trump expressed low opinions of all Black folks, from music to culture and politics‚Äù. Besides, he also called Nelson Mandela ‚Äúno leader‚Äù. = Religion = = Sports = A 2018 study found evidence that nonblack voters in Heisman Trophy voting were biased against nonblack players. A 2019 study found that after controlling for objective measures of performance, broadcast commentators were \\"more likely to discuss the performance and mental abilities of lighter-skinned players and the physical characteristics of darker-skinned players\\" in the Men‚Äôs Division I Basketball Tournament.  Wealth  Large racial differentials in wealth remain in the United States: between whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of twenty. An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, \\"The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it's also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States.\\"\\"Census report: Broad racial disparities persist\\", November 14, 2006. Differentials applied to the Social Security Act (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector which then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after World War II. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.George Lipsitz, \\"The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the \\"White\\" Problem in American Studies,\\" American Quarterly, Vol. 47, No. 3. (September 1995), pp. 369‚Äì387.  Contemporary issues  = Hate crimes and terrorism = In the United States, most crimes in which victims are targeted on the basis of their race or ethnicity are considered hate crimes. (For federal law purposes, crimes in which Hispanics are targeted because of their identity are considered hate crimes based on ethnicity.) Leading forms of bias which are cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings include: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005.Hate Crime Statistics, 2004. Hate Crime Statistics, 2005. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, whites, blacks, and Hispanics had similar rates of violent hate crime victimization between 2007 and 2011.Hate Crime Reported by Victims and Police , Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911. However, from 2011 to 2012, violent hate crimes against Hispanic people increased by 300%. When considering all hate crimes, not just violent ones, African Americans are far more likely to be victims than other racial groups. The New Century Foundation, a white nationalist organization founded by Jared Taylor, argues that blacks are more likely to commit hate crimes than whites, and it also argues that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as \\"white\\".The Color of Crime, 1999. Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the mainstream criminological view that \\"Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors.\\"Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, Coloring Crime . NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.Tim Wise, \\"The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science,\\" 2004.Southern Poverty Law Center, Coloring Crime . The first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the murder of Vincent Chin, an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by two white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent, but the assailants testified in the criminal court case that he \\"looked like a Jap\\", an ethnic slur that is used to describe Japanese and other Asians, and they were angry enough to beat him to death. = Hateful views = Continuing antisemitism has remained an issue in the United States and the 2011 Survey of American Attitudes Toward Jews in America, released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has found that the recent world economic recession increased the expression of some antisemitic viewpoints among Americans. Most of the people who were surveyed expressed pro-Jewish sentiments, with 64% of them agreeing that Jews have contributed much to U.S. social culture. Yet the polling also found that 19% of Americans answered \\"probably true\\" to the antisemitic canard that \\"Jews have too much control/influence on Wall Street\\" (see Economic antisemitism) while 15% of Americans concurred with the related statement that Jews seem \\"more willing to use shady practices\\" in business than other people do. Reflecting on the lingering antisemitism of about one in five Americans, Abraham H. Foxman, the ADL's national director, has argued, \\"It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public.\\" An ABC News report which was released in 2007 recounted that past ABC polls which were conducted over a period of several years have tended to find that \\"six percent have self- reported harboring prejudice against Jews, 27 percent have self-reported harboring prejudice against Muslims, 25 percent have self-reported harboring prejudice against Arabs,\\" and \\"one in 10 have conceded harboring at least a little bit of prejudice \\" against Hispanic Americans. The report also stated that a full 34% of Americans reported harboring \\"some racist feelings\\" in general as a self-description. An Associated Press and Yahoo News survey of 2,227 adult Americans in 2008 found that 10% of white respondents stated that \\"a lot\\" of discrimination still exists against African-Americans while 45% of white respondents stated that only \\"some\\" discrimination still exists against African Americans compared to 57% of black respondents who stated that \\"a lot\\" of discrimination still exists against African Americans. In the same poll, more whites applied positive attributes to black Americans than negative ones, with blacks describing whites even more highly, but a significant minority of whites still called African Americans \\"irresponsible\\", \\"lazy\\", or other such things. In 2008, Stanford University political scientist Paul Sniderman remarked that, in the modern U.S., racism and prejudices are \\"a deep challenge, and it's one that Americans in general, and for that matter, political scientists, just haven't been ready to acknowledge fully.\\" In 2017, citizens gathered in the college community of Charlottesville, Virginia to attend the Unite the Right rally. One woman was killed and dozens of other people were injured when a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. Vice President Mike Pence condemned the violence by stating, \\"We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\\"  Alleviation  There is a wide plethora of societal and political suggestions to alleviate the effects of continued discrimination in the United States. For example, within universities, it has been suggested that a type of committee could respond to non-sanctionable behavior. It is also argued that there is a need for \\"white students and faculty to reformulate white-awareness toward a more secure identity that is not threatened by black cultural institutions and can recognize the racial non- neutrality of the institutions which whites dominate\\" (Brown, 334). Paired with this effort, Brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members, so the embedded white normative experience begins to fragment. Within the media, it is found that racial cues prime racial stereotypic thought. Thus, it is argued that \\"stereotype inconsistent cues might lead to more intentioned thought, thereby suppressing racial priming effects.\\" Social psychologists, such as Jennifer Eberhardt, have done work that indicates such priming effects subconsciously help determine attitudes and behavior toward individuals regardless of intentions. These results have been incorporated into training, for example, in some police departments. It has also been argued that more evidence-based guidance from psychologists and sociologists is needed in order for people to learn what is effective in alleviating racism. Such evidence- based approaches can reveal, for example, the many psychological biases to which humans are subject, such as ingroup bias and the fundamental attribution error, which can underlie racist attitudes. Psychologist Stuart Vyse has argued that argument, ideas, and facts will not mend divisions but there is evidence, such as that which is provided by the Robbers Cave Experiment, that seeking shared goals can help alleviate racism.

It is the sequel to The Sentinel by Geoff Crammond and features 651 levels, a multiplayer mode and a soundtrack (titled \\"Earth/Air\\") composed by John Carpenter and arranged by Gary McKill. The PC version has native support limited to a software display mode and an accelerated Glide mode, because in 1998, 3DFX cards were the de facto standard for gaming 3D graphics. However, modern computers can run the game in accelerated mode with the wrappers nGlide,nGlide on zeus-software.com dgVoodoo,dgVoodoo site OpenGlideOpenGlide site or zeckensack's Glide wrapper,zeckensack.de site which translate Glide calls respectively into Direct3D or OpenGL calls. This game looks very different from its predecessor. While in The Sentinel the levels were bright and colorful, in Sentinel Returns they are dark and gloomy, with flashes of light being emitted when an object is created or absorbed, and the mouse pointer dynamically lighting the world. The game has a general \\"hallucinated\\" look: the skies are made out of contrasting streaks of color; the trees are white; the boulders pulsate as if breathing; the sentinels and sentries are hybrids of flesh and metal; the sentinel stands are covered with skin and have four vertebral columns protruding from the corners; the \\"specimen\\" representing the living part of the synthoid resembles a hydatidiform mole, and it squirms and lets out a shriek when injected with a needle.  Game mechanics  Controlling Synthoids that are standing at a higher level is fundamental to the game, because only the objects which occupy a visible square can be interacted with (the player may absorb or create objects on a boulder if the sides can be seen). While doing so, the player must watch for the rotation of the Sentinel and be careful not to stand in an area which the Sentinel can see, or else it will start absorbing energy from the Synthoid, and when the energy is gone, the game is over. Height is gained by placing a boulder on any visible square, and putting a Synthoid on the boulder. The player may then transfer consciousness to the new Synthoid, and absorb the old one. Stacks of boulders of any height may be created, if the player has enough energy. In order to absorb the Sentinel, the player must create a stack of boulders of sufficient height that the Synthoid on top can look down on the Sentinel's platform. A level is won by absorbing the Sentinel off its platform, creating a new Synthoid in the place of the Sentinel, transferring the consciousness to it and hyperspacing to a new level. The number of levels that are skipped between two that are played depends on the amount of energy the player has accumulated when he jumps into hyperspace: absorbing less than 50% of the total energy present in a level will skip a level; absorbing between 50% and 69% will skip two; absorbing between 70% to 89% will skip three; absorbing between 90% and 100% will skip four. Once the Sentinel is absorbed, the player may no longer absorb any energy from the landscape, although objects may be created as normal. This enables particularly troublesome levels to be skipped, by returning to a previous level, and finishing it with a different amount of energy than before. In later levels, the Sentinel is assisted by a number of Sentries. They behave exactly like the Sentinel, but absorbing them is not necessary to complete the level. Unlike the Sentinel, the Sentries do not stand on a platform but on ordinary squares. The rotation of the Sentinel and the Sentries is slow and predictable. However, if there are many Sentries, there will be few safe locations anywhere on the landscape. If either the Sentinel or the Sentries see a square with more than 1 unit of energy (boulders or a synthoid), their rotation stops while they absorb the energy, one unit at a time. They must be able to see the square on which the energy is located for absorption to take place. Meanwhile, to keep the total energy of the landscape constant, a tree is created randomly on the landscape for each absorbed unit of energy. Thus, in general terms, absorption is simply the transplanting of energy to another location on the game field. Attention must also be paid to nearby trees: if the Sentinel or Sentry can see a Synthoid or a boulder, but not the square it is standing on, and there are trees in the vicinity, it will transform one of them into a Meanie, which will start rotating. If the player is in a Synthoid when the Meanie turns to face them, and the Meanie can see the square the Synthoid is standing on, it will force the Synthoid to hyperspace and lose 3 units of energy. If the Meanie itself cannot see the player's square after a full rotation, it will turn back into a tree and the Sentinel or Sentry will resume rotation. If the player chooses, they may perform a Hyperspace. This will use 3 units of energy to create a new Synthoid at a random location on the playfield. This location is at the same height or lower than the players current height. While performing a hyperspace can be advantageous if the immediate area is fully in the gaze of the Sentinel and/or Sentries, by way of possibly taking you far away from the danger zone, it is generally used as a last resort due to its unpredictable nature. This is because it may take you into a deep ravine from which you may not be able to build up enough boulders to escape from. Also, hyperspacing without the required 3 units of energy (either by player invocation or Meanie) will result in the player losing. List of objects that can exist in the Sentinel world: * Tree (1 unit of energy) * Meanie (1 unit of energy) * Boulder (2 units of energy) * Synthoid (3 units of energy) * Sentry (3 units of energy) * Sentinel (4 units of energy)  Game mechanics differences from the predecessor  * The action is faster and the movements (rotating the synthoid and transferring the consciousness from a synthoid to another) happen in real time. This allows the player to move much more quickly across the landscape and to complete a level in far less time. To counterbalance this, the Sentinels and Sentries (which have a FOV of 28 degrees) are able to absorb energy from the synthoid at a much greater rate. * By absorbing a sentry, a tree is created in a random square in the level. * There are \\"only\\" 651 single player levels, while there were 10,000 in the first episode. For this reason, it is only possible to skip up to 4 levels when one is finished. * A multiplayer mode is present. To start a multiplayer match on the PC version, the host needs to set up the random creation of a level, choose a DirectPlay service provider, type a host name and a player name, and finally select \\"Host a Session\\". Every guest needs to select the same service provider and select \\"Join a Session\\". The goal of multiplayer mode is to race each other to the Sentinel; every player can teleport each other's synthoid to lower levels. The supported DirectPlay service providers are IPX, TCP/IP, modem and serial. * The game has two endings. To see the first one, the player must beat the 651st level. To see the second one, the player must beat every level, or \\"achieve 100% orchid\\", as this is expressed in the game.  Graphical differences between PC and PlayStation version  PlayStation version PC version Although their gameplay is almost identical, the two versions have several differences in their graphical look. * The level selection and level loading screens are fully polygonal in the PC version, while they are made out of 2D elements in the PS1 version. * The 3D models have more polygons in the PC version than in the PS1 version. * The PC version has colored lights (although only with the hardware accelerated rendering), the PS1 version does not. * The levels have different architectures in the two versions. * The checkerboard patterns are more evident in the PS1 version, which has also rougher-looking slopes than the PC version. * The skies have orbiting planets in the PS1 version, they do not in the PC version. * When an object is created in the PC version, it appears abruptly. In the PS1 version, a seed (when a tree is created) or 2/3 \\"energy clusters\\" (when a boulder or a synthoid is created) fly to the selected square, while rotating polygons assemble into the object. * When an object is absorbed in the PC version, it disappears abruptly and generates a number of \\"energy rings\\" which quickly disappear. In the PS1 version, it disassembles into rotating polygons, while a seed (when a tree is absorbed) or 2/3 \\"energy clusters\\" (when a boulder, a synthoid or a sentry is absorbed) fly to the player's POV. * The explosion of the sentinel is seen from the player's point of view in the PC version and as a non-interactive scene in the PS1 version. * After a level has been beaten in the PC version, a vortex made of a spiral and a number of triangles appears above the sentinel stand; in the PS1 version it does not, but is mentioned anyway in the manual. * In the level-ending hyperspace scene, in the PC version the POV looks up into the vortex, while it looks down toward the synthoid in the PS1 version. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Those who have fond memories of the original or who crave a new PlayStation experience should rent before buying. It's definitely an acquired taste.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1998 video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Psygnosis games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games ","title":"Sentinel Returns"},{"id":"2162859","text":"Jean Mathieu de Chazelles (24 July 1657 - 16 January 1710), French hydrographer, was born in Lyon.

He competed in the Southeastern United States, winning titles in several promotions, including World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Professional wrestling career =National Wrestling Alliance (1986‚Äì1988)= Champion started wrestling in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1986, making his debut in a match against Ivan Koloff on an NWA Worldwide taping that April. He gained his first televised victory only a month later when he pinned The Golden Terror (Thunderfoot) on the May 24 edition of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. However Champion was used primarily as a jobber, until he was sent to the Central States territory to team with D.J. Peterson to develop his skills. He and Peterson captured the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship by defeating The Thunderfoots (Joel Deaton and Dave Deaton) on November 7, 1986. They held the title for almost two months before dropping it to The MOD Squad (Mack and James Jefferson) on January 2, 1987. Champion made a full-time return to Jim Crockett Promotions in April 1987. He teamed with Denny Brown to defeat The Mulkey Brothers in the first round of the 1987 Crockett Cup. The duo would then lose to The Giant Baba & Isao Takagi in the second round. In his second year he experienced more success, winning matches against The Thunderfoots, The Italian Stallion, and John Savage. On June 6, 1987 edition of NWA Pro Champion earned a title shot against NWA Television Champion Tully Blanchard but was unsuccessful. While continuing to be an enhancement talent, Champion teamed frequently with Italian Stallion, Denny Brown, and Lazer Tron throughout the year. He finished his run in November 1987. =World Wrestling Federation (1988)= On March 9, 1988, Champion wrestled in a dark match at a WWF Superstars of Wrestling taping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He defeated Barry Horowitz in the encounter. =All Japan Pro Wrestling, Mexico (1989‚Äì1991)= In 1989, Champion wrestled in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling. He made his debut on August 19, 1989 when he teamed with Terry Gordy in an unsuccessful effort against The Great Kabuki & Yoshiaki Yatsu. Ten days later he and Gordy defeated John Tenta & Shunji Takano. Champion then wrestled in Mexico as KGB, where he continued to develop his skills. =World Championship Wrestling (1991‚Äì1992)= A now seasoned Todd Champion returned to the United States in July 1991 and formed a tag team called The Patriots with Firebreaker Chip in World Championship Wrestling. They were billed as hailing from \\"WCW Special Forces\\", with Todd Champion wearing military fatigues and Firebreaker Chip wearing a fireman's helmet and coat. They feuded with The Fabulous Freebirds and The Young Pistols. The Patriots won the WCW United States Tag Team Championship by defeating the Freebirds on August 12, 1991 and defended the title before losing it to the Young Pistols on November 5. The team disbanded and Champion left the promotion after facing The Super Invader (Hercules Hernandez) at WrestleWar on May 17, 1992. =United States Wrestling Association (1992)= Champion went to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), where he feuded with Butch Reed and Jerry Lawler over their top title. He won the title, the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Reed on October 17, 1992. He held the title belt for sixteen days before dropping it to Lawler on November 2. =World Wrestling Federation (1993)= Champion wrestled a dark match on March 8, 1993, in North Charleston, South Carolina at a WWF Superstars taping, defeating Rikki Nelson. =World Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1994, 1995, 1997)= On the November 14, 1993 edition of WCW Main Event Champion made his return to WCW when he defeated Rip Rogers. He was then interviewed by Tony Schiavone, where he challenged WCW Television Champion Lord Steven Regal. The following week he wrestled Regal to a draw. On the November 28 edition Champion then beat Regal by disqualification. The two would have yet another match, this time on the February 12, 1994 edition of WCW Worldwide where Regal finally emerged victorious. He next appeared at Bash at the Beach 95 when he attempted to save Alex Wright from a postmatch attack by Vader. On December 15, 1997 Champion reunited with Curtis Thompson for a Monday Nitro dark match against Samula Anoa'i and Sam Fatu (Samoan Swat Team). Now dubbed \\"The American Patriots\\", Champion and Thompson emerged victorious. =Later years (1995‚Äì2002)= Champion went on to wrestle in the independent circuit.

In 1922, he received a BA and in 1924 a JD from the University of California at Berkeley. Career Crum started his career as a teacher of English and International Law at UC/Berkeley. =Neylan and Hearst= In the 1920s, Crum worked for John Francis Neylan whose major client was media magnate William Randolph Hearst (here ) In 1924, Crum joined the law offices of John Francis Neylan, chief attorney for newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. As a Hearst lawyer, Crum helped defend Clarence Darrow in 1933. \\"Darrow taught me more law than I had known before,\\" Crum said later. In 1934, Neylan, \\"along with Bartley Crum, a young associate who functioned as an administrative aide,\\" called newspaper publishers together to take a stand against the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike and accompanying San Francisco General strike. According to ex-Popular Front, liberal journalist Sidney Roger, Neylan was the \\"mastermind\\" for the shipping industry to break the strikes by convincing Bay area newspapers of a \\"Communist plot,\\" during which time Crum \\"became a strong supporter of the longshore union and Harry Bridges.\\" =Kenny and NLG= Crum helped defend against the deportation of his friend Harry Bridges in 1939 In 1938, Crum left Neylan and set up a law office with Philip Ehrlich and David A. Silver. In 1938 or 1939, he joined the National Lawyers Guild as an organization of progressive and Communist lawyers to counter the conservative National Bar Association (NLG), probably at the behest of friend and fellow liberal Republican Robert W. Kenny. In 1939, Crum helped defend Harry Bridges in one of his deportation hearings. He also criticized the US policy during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. In 1942, Crum was a vice president of NLG's local chapter. In 1943, Crum served as president of the NLG's San Francisco chapter. In 1943‚Äì1944, Crum sponsored American Youth for Democracy. =Wendell Willkie= For the 1940 and 1944 presidential elections, Crum supported Wendell Willkie (here, on the cover of Time magazine, July 31, 1939 Crum worked in the 1940 and 1944 campaigns of U.S. presidential candidate Wendell Willkie. In 1941, he became chairman for the Western US of \\"Fight for Freedom, Inc.,\\" an group favoring intervention in World War II (in alignment with Wilkie). In 1943, Crum served as special counsel on FDR's Fair Employment Practices Committee. He also served as WilIke's liaison to FDR via David Niles. When Wilkie failed to get the nomination, Crum helped form \\"Independent Republicans for Roosevelt\\" and campaigned for FDR, occasionally with Harry S. Truman. In October 1944, Crum served as an attorney for Harry Bridges. In November 1944, Crum sent a letter to the Civil Service Commission on behalf of Larry Resner on the subject of loyalty charges. On March 18, 1945, Crum signed a statement issued by the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, advertised in the Daily Worker. In September 1945, Crum chaired a rally of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee (JAFRC), which featured an overseas call from Harold Laski. By year end, Crum's clients included Owl Drug, United Drug, and Borden's Milk. He was national vice president of the NLG, national co-chair of the CIO-PAC, and California chair of United China War Relief. Rumor had it that he would succeed Harold L. Ickes as United States Secretary of the Interior. =Anglo- American Committee of Inquiry= Crum served on the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry (here, future president of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, testifies before the committee) On January 1, 1946, Crum accepted an invitation to join the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry on Palestine (AACIP) that advised President Harry Truman to support the opening of the British Mandate of Palestine to unrestricted Jewish immigration and to ease restrictions on Jewish land purchases. On February 17, 1946, Crum announced in Vienna, Austria, that he expected to see \\"mass suicides\\" if European Jews did not receive permission to emigrate to Palestine. His book, Behind the Silken Curtain a Personal Account of Anglo-American Diplomacy in Palestine and the Middle East was published by Simon & Schuster in 1947. \\"He charged the British were up to their traditional divide-and-conquer policies.\\" When Clifford Clarke succeeded the issue of Israeli independence from David Niles, he received \\"advice and assistance\\" from Crum, Eliahu Epstein, and Max Lowenthal. Israeli State Archives show that on May 11, 1948, Crum visited President Harry S. Truman: \\"Crum [Bartley Crum] saw President yesterday, returned fairly optimistic.\\" Crum became chairman of the national council of Americans for Haganah, whose director was David Wahl. =Hollywood Ten= Robert W. Kenny (undated), 21st California Attorney General, was a long-time friend and colleague of Crum As vice president of the NLG's state chapter and with Kenny as president, Crum entered into increasing prominent issues involving civil rights of left-leaning people. In 1946, Crum answered Paul Robeson in his \\"crusade call\\" and endorsed the American Crusade Against Lynching (ACAL) organization. The ACAL had been accused of socialist and communist motives; which led to the organization, including Crum, coming under close watch by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and shadowed him constantly. In 1946, Crum was a member of the national board of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP), which also had a large branch in California, the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. On July 9, 1946, Crum appeared on a radio program called \\"What's On Your Mind About Russia?\\" In 1946‚Äì1947, Crum was vice chairman and a sponsor of the National Committee to Win the Peace, which joined another group that Crum sponsored called the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy. At the end of 1946, as ICCASP merged with National Citizens Political Action Committee to form the Progressive Citizens Association (PCA), Crum became the PCA's national vice chairman. In 1947, Crum served as attorney for some of the so-called \\"Hollywood Ten\\" (originally the \\"Unfriendly Nineteen\\"), subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee. National Lawyers Guild members formed the core team, originally Charles Katz and Ben Margolis, followed by Crum and Robert W. Kenny, followed by Martin Popper in Washington and Sam Rosenwein in New York. During pre-hearing preparation, the Nineteen and their lawyers negotiated and agreed to a strategy of unanimity as well as a please to cite the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. His daughter recalled: > I first learned about the Hollywood blacklist on Nov. 24, 1947. I remember > the exact moment. I was standing with my father, Bartley Crum, by a phone > booth near Union Square in San Francisco, feeding him nickels and dimes > while he made a series of intense phone calls to Dore Schary, who was the > head of MGM. > If you're wondering why he had to make those calls from a pay phone, it's > because our home phone was bugged by the F.B.I. At that point I was too > young to quite grasp the significance of those bugged calls, but I did know > that my father had been one of six lawyers who had just defended the > Hollywood 10 in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) > in Washington. She also recorded differences between Communist and non-Communist lawyers (in which latter camp Crum was), contrary to other accounts of greater unity among lawyers. =New York Star= PM with Joseph Fels Barnes from Marshall Field III (here, 1919) and renamed it New York Star In 1948, due to blowback from the HUAC Hollywood hearings, Crum moved his family from the San Francisco Bay area to New York City. In 1948, Crum's name appeared as a member of the board of directors of the California Labor School, listed as a subversive organization by US Attorney General Tom C. Clark in December 1947 on the AGLOSO. In May 1948, Joseph Starobin, foreign news editor of the Daily Worker, referred in print to Crum's \\"unquestionably progressive career.\\" In early June 1948, Crum appeared before the American Russian Instititute and expressed his \\"Soviet sympathy\\" (according to the FBI)> In June 1948, Crum bought a major interest in the dying PM newspaper with Joseph Fels Barnes from Marshall Field III, who maintained a minority interest. On June 23, 1948, they renamed PM as the New York Star. Also in the 1948 United States presidential election, he supported Harry S. Truman (Democrat) over Thomas E. Dewey (Republican) or Henry A. Wallace (Progressive). In January 1949, the Star folded (and helped undermine Crum's personal finances). During that year, Crum joined Hays, Podell, Algase, Crum & Feuer with offices at 39 Broadway. =Continued politics= In 1950, Crum's name came up in Congress during investigation into Truman crony Max Lowenthal. On September 15, 1950, Lowenthal appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee AKA \\"HUAC\\" (two of whose members were Mundt and Nixon‚Äìof the Mundt-Nixon Bill). Already in August 1950, HUAC had re-subpoenaed four witness who had been part of Whittaker Chambers's Ware Group: Lee Pressman, Nathan Witt, Charles Kramer and John Abt. The committee had asked both Pressman and Kramer whether they knew Lowenthal; both confirmed. Lowenthal brought former U.S. Senator Burton K. Wheeler as counsel. After reviewing his curriculum vitae, the committee tried to link him with known Communist Party members and organizations, some of which he confirmed, others not, all without admitting any wrongdoing. Names mentioned included: Crum, Alger Hiss, Donald Hiss, David Wahl, Martin Popper, Allan Rosenberg, Lee Pressman, the Russian-American Industrial Corporation, the Twentieth Century Fund, and the International Juridical Association. In the 1952 United States presidential election, Crum supported Adlai E. Stevenson (Democrat) over Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican). In 1953, syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler wrote of Crum: > I telephoned Bartley Crum, a California lawyer with offices in New York and > a Red record so bad that he hangs his head in shame, and asked whether > Lowenthal had had any real connection with the Hollywood Reds and their > friends, the so-called Hollywood Committee on the First Amendment... > Incidentally, he became counsel for Drew Pearson in one of his dragging > suits against me but finally came into my lawyer's office to say that he had > never forsaken his Catholicism and that he was ashamed of his Red record. > During the examination of the Hollywood Reds, Crum consulted Lowenthal > because he regarded the man as an expert on the procedures and the authority > of congressional committees. Crum says Lowenthal told him the best course > was to tell the committee frankly whether this or that one was a member of > the Communist Party. By contrast with this advice Lowenthal himself in his > appearance before the House committee was remarkably vague on many matters. > However, on careful review of his old testimony I conclude that my early > impression was incorrect that he positively withheld the names of > \\"organizations\\" which arranged for his appointment to a job on Gen. Clay's > staff in Germany just after the war. He said there were five such > \\"organizations\\" and named one, but the committee wandered off and did not > press him to identify the others. It was not up to him to volunteer the > information and I know the committee regarded the subject as a hot potato. > He did admit knowing a number of the most notorious Reds of the movement but > his voluntary estimate of the political character of his friend, Crum, is > laughable in view of Crum's own admission to my attorneys and to Alfred > Kohlberg, one of the most effective Red-baiters in the country, that he was > ashamed of his activity in the Red movement, Lowenthal said: \\"I had > confidence in his true Americanism.\\" Thus, Lowenthal's notion of true > Americanism is peculiar or his knowledge of Crum's activities up to then was > faulty. =Teamsters involvement= Shortly before his suicide, Crum became embroiled in an issue with Jimmy Hoffa of the \\"Teamsters\\" In 1958, Crum became involved in a controversy with Jimmy Hoffa, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\\"Teamsters\\"). He had been trying to collect $210,000 in legal fees from the Teamsters for a client (lawyers represented by Godfrey P. Schmidt). He testified in before the United States Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field. Death In 1947 (prior to the HUAC hearings), Crum first took a combination of alcohol and barbiturates, from which he was revived. In the early hours of February 9, 1949, a few days after the New York Star folded, Crum made a second suicide attempt, again with pills and alcohol. Doctors who treated him included Gregory Zilboorg, a psychiatrist who also treated Lillian Hellman. By the late 1950s, long labeled a subversive, Crum had lost most of his clients. Unable to cope with stress from the harassment, he successfully committed suicide on December 9, 1959, by washing down an entire bottle of seconal with whisky. His wife discovered his body at their home at 165 East Eightieth Street, New York City. Personal life Crum married Anna Gertrude Bosworth, an author of novels and (later) a cookbook. They had two children. The younger, son Bartley Crum, Jr., committed suicide in 1953 by shooting himself with his grandfather's gun in his freshman year at Reed College. The older, daughter Patricia Bosworth, became first a successful actress and then even more successful writer. In 1997, she wrote a family memoir, Anything Your Little Heart Desires, reminiscing about her father. In 2017, she wrote a second memoir about her father, brother, and husbands, called The Men in My Life: Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan. She died from complications of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. In 1941, Crum moved his family from Berkeley to 763 Bay Street, San Francisco. In 1945, they moved again to 2626 Green Street, San Francisco. In 1948, they moved to New York City, where they lived at several addresses. Legacy In their obituary of Crum in 1959, the New York Times quoted Crum's stance on outlawing the CPUSA: > It is unconstitutional and utterly stupid for government to attempt to > prevent people from thinking or believing as they wish... As a non- > Comnunist, I think the most effective answer to the Marxists is to make our > democracy work by providing equality and job opportunities for all, > strengthening the trade unions, and raising the standard of living. Assessing his daughter's 1997 memoir, the New York Times wrote that she remembered him as: > a hero-daddy who championed just causes, the doughty fighter for civil > rights who defended the Hollywood Ten; the politically connected lawyer, > friend of Harry S. Truman and Wendell L. Willkie; the member of the Anglo- > American Committee of Inquiry Into Palestine in 1946 who told the world > about the plight of the Jewish death-camp survivors in displaced-persons > camps and fought for their safe passage to Palestine against British and > Arab double-dealing... [Yet his] addiction to political causes and big legal > retainers exercised a centrifugal pull away from the family he certainly > loved. She also admitted, \\"My father informed on two colleagues already known to be Communists.\\" In 1978, during an interview regarding who came up with the idea of arguing the First over Fifth Amendment in October 1947, Carey McWilliams said: > I don't know exactly. As I said, the Hollywood Ten were represented by > brilliant lawyers: Bob Kenny and Bartley Crum and Charles Katz. They > certainly explained to them, I'm sure, that they could plead the Fifth > Amendment. But they didn't want to. They didn't want to. They were a notably > independent group of people; and I would say in some cases more than > independent: stubborn!--like John Howard Lawson, who was a hard man to push > around. They were determined to take this position, and it was a correct > position to take. The problem was that they did not succeed, in my judgment, > in getting across what their real position was. It wasn't their fault that > they couldn't get it across. There was shouting, and the hearings were > confused, and all the rest of it. But they had a sound position. As of late 1999, Boston University houses many of Crum's papers in the archive of his daughter. In 2014, Larry Ceplair and Christopher Trumbo (son of Dalton Trumbo) criticized the portrait of Crum by daughter Patricia Bosworth in her memoir Anything Your Little Heart Desires over the issue of \\"unanimity\\" demanded among the Nineteen and their lawyers. They argue that Crum must have known about their strategy of unanimity, whereas Bosworth claimed he only learned later. Crum was no \\"innocent dupe,\\" nor was his client Dmytryk. They support their critique by citing Crum's long-term membership in the National Lawyers Guild, with its strong Communist partisans. Works Crum's book was the \\"President's favorite\\" (referring to Truman). Albert Kahn of the Worker also endorsed the book, as did the New Masses and American Youth for Democracy. * Behind the Silken Curtain: A Personal Account of Anglo-American Diplomacy in Palestine and the Middle East (1947) See also * Patricia Bosworth * Harry Bridges * Robert W.

Biography Athanasios Christopoulos A statue in Kastoria Christopoulos was born in Kastoria in Macedonia. He studied at Buda and Padua, and became tutor to the children of Alexander Mourousis, Prince of Wallachia. After the fall of that prince in 1811, Christopoulos was employed by John Caradja, who had been appointed hospodar of Walachia, in drawing up a code of laws for that country. On the removal of Caradja, Christopoulos retired into private life and devoted himself to literature promoting the Demotiki (of the people) form of Greek language. He wrote drinking songs and love ditties which were very popular among the Greeks. He is also the author of a tragedy, of Politika Parallela (a comparison of various systems of government), of translations of Homer and Heraclitus, and of some philological works on the connection between ancient and modern Greek. His Hellenika Archaiologemata (Athens, 1853) contains an account of his life. Thomas K.

Life Winzet was born in Renfrew, Scotland, and was probably educated at the university of Glasgow. He was ordained priest in 1540, and in 1552 was appointed master of the grammar school of Linlithgow, from which town he was later \\"expellit and schott out\\" by the partisans of Dean Patrick Kinlochy, \\"preacher\\" there. He had also enjoyed the office of Provost of the Collegiate Church of St Michael in that town. He retired to Edinburgh, where the return of Mary, Queen of Scots, from France had given heart to the Catholics. There he took part in the pamphlet war which then raged, and entered into conflict with John Knox and other leading reformers. He appears to have acted for a time as confessor to the queen. In July 1562, when engaged in the printing of his Last Blast, he narrowly escaped the vengeance of his opponents, who had by that time gained the upper hand in the capital, and he fled, on 3 September, with the nuncio Gouda to Leuven. He reached Paris in 1565 and became a member of the \\"German Nation\\" of the university. At Queen Mary's request he joined Bishop Leslie on his embassy to Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, and remained with the bishop after his removal by Elizabeth's orders to ward at Fenny Staunton, Huntingdonshire. When further suspicion fell on Leslie and he was committed to the Tower, Winzet was permitted to return to Paris. There he continued his studies, and in 1574 left for Douai, where in the following year he became a licentiate. He was in residence at Rome from 1575 to 1577, and was then appointed by Pope Gregory XIII abbot of the Benedictine monastery of St James, Regensburg. There he died on 21 September 1592. Winzet's works are almost entirely controversial. He justified his literary activity on the side of Catholicism on the double plea of conscience and the inability of the bishops and theologians to supply the necessary arguments (hies' Tractate, ed. STS, i. p. so). \\"We may nawayis langer contene vs,\\" he writes, \\"hot expresse on al sydis as we think, referring Jur iugement to the haly Catholik Kirk.\\" In his first work, Certaine Tractates (three in number), printed in 1562, he rates his fellow clergy for negligence and sin, invites replies from Knox regarding his authority as minister and his share in the new ecclesiastical constitution, and protests against the interference with Catholic burgesses by the magistrates of Edinburgh. The Last Blast, which was interrupted in publication, is an onslaught on heretics and a falsely ordained clergy. In his Bake of Four Scoir Thee Questions (1563), addressed to the \\"Calviniane Precheouris,\\" in which he treats of church doctrine, sacraments, priesthood, obedience to rulers, free- will and other matters, he is dogmatic rather than polemical. He translated the Commonitorium of Vincentius Lirinensis (1563), and wrote, in Latin, a Flagellum sectarionum and a Velitatio in Georgium Buchananum (1582). Works Winzet's vernacular writings have been edited by J. Hewison for the Scottish Text Society (2 vols, 1888, 1890). The Tractates were printed, with a preface by David Laing, by the Maitland Club (1835).

He currently hosts \\"Brick at Night With JT the Brick\\" on Sirius XM Satellite Radio's Mad Dog Sports Radio, a show on KRLV in Las Vegas, and various programs for the Las Vegas Raiders including the team's radio pregame show. Tournour graduated from SUNY Geneseo in 1987 with a degree in Speech Communication. He was also president of Delta Kappa Tau fraternity and a member of the rugby team. Career Tournour, a former stockbroker, got his start in sports radio after becoming a frequent caller to The Jim Rome Show. After winning the inaugural \\"Smack-Off\\" in 1995, Tournour was offered a job hosting a late-night Sunday show at KMAX-Los Angeles. From there, Tournour moved his show to KFMB-San Diego, where he only spent a few weeks before being offered a show on the now-defunct Las Vegas-based Sports Fan Radio Network. Tournour's late-night show lasted five years, until the network's demise in 2001. While working in Las Vegas, he called the very first game of the original XFL featuring the Las Vegas Outlaws over local radio. During this time, he also hosted an afternoon show on San Francisco-based radio station KNBR. At one time, KNBR had Tournour for his local show, his four-hour national show, and an overnight replay of at least a portion of that national show before the next broadcast day began. In June 2001, Tournour landed at the upstart Fox Sports Radio, hosting an afternoon show. He was later moved to the evening, hosting a late-night syndicated sports show on SportsFan Radio Network. The show was shifted to 3 pm Pacific, 6 pm Eastern, in 2012. Tournour also hosted, until the end of the 2005 season, a Sunday night show, Fox Sunday Game Time React, where he discussed the football games of the day with Bryan Cox. This was eventually replaced by a similar show hosted by John Fricke and Chris Landry. He previously hosted a show that aired weekdays from 5pm to 8pm Pacific time (8pm to 11pm Eastern) on Fox Sports Radio. The primary focus of his Fox Sports Radio program was the NFL, and, on Friday nights during the season and playoffs, he called for at least one caller from every NFL team (during the playoffs, those in the playoffs) to answer his \\"NFL Roll Call\\". Fox Sports announced on Sept. 11, 2018 that Tournour and producer Steve Gorman were let go by the network.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/170474/steve- gorman-jt-the-brick-out-at-fox-sports-radio/ JT The Brick Out at Fox Sports Radio Tournour made a guest appearance on CNBC's The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch on June 26, 2006, to discuss the feud between Chicago Sun-Times columnist Jay Mariotti, and Chicago White Sox skipper Ozzie Guill√©n. =The JT the Brick Show= Tomm Looney, the voice of The Best Damn Sports Show Period, works alongside Tournour on the show. Looney is best known for providing the two-times-hourly sports updates and for hosting the entertainment segment of the show which is called \\"Pop Looney.\\" In addition to his hosting duties, Tournour was for a time regular sports columnist for MSNBC.com. = Brick at Night with JT The Brick = On October 8, 2019 JT began hosting his own late night show, \\"Brick at Night With JT the Brick.\\" on Sirius XM‚Äòs Mad Dog Sports Radio. The show airs Sunday through Thursday nights at 11PM - 3AM eastern (8 PM - 12 AM Pacific). Origin of nickname The nickname \\"the Brick\\" comes from his time as a caller to The Jim Rome Show. A \\"brick\\" is a common slang term in basketball for a shot that bounces off the backboard. Rome often referred to Tournour's favorite team, the New York Knicks, as the \\"Bricks\\". Relationship with Jim Rome Tournour made himself available for an extensive interview in Alan Eisenstock's 2001 book, Sports Talk (Rome declined numerous requests for an interview for the same book). In the interview, Tournour details his decision to leave a six-figure income as a stockbroker to chase his dream of talking sports for a living. He also weighs in on his relationship with Rome: On July 4, 2019, Tournour guest hosted for Jim Rome for the first time ever.  Family  Tournour purchased a residence in Summerlin, Nevada with his wife Julie and his two sons on January 7, 2010.

The opening and closing theme is \\"Lust for Life\\" by Iggy Pop, and the show also uses \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses The program usually begins with headlines, when Rome highlights the main sports news of the day with his thoughts and opinions. Rome refers to his listeners as \\"Clones\\". One of the main parts of the program is Rome reading emails and Tweets on air. He usually comments positively or negatively depending on the message. Ones he does not like are crumpled and thrown in the garbage. Many emails and Tweets are \\"smack talk\\", where the messenger is putting down someone in sports, pop culture, or even other listeners. Rome takes calls and ask callers to call in, though many times he does not take any of the calls at all. Rome's rules for calls is \\"have a take, don't suck.\\" Calls that are good in his opinion will be racked, which means they will be saved for future use. Bad calls get buzzed and cut off, followed usually by humiliation from Rome. Some calls get neither and usually will be followed by brief analysis or thoughts by Rome. The final segments of the show usually include e-mail and Twitter contests. Sometimes these contests include gift cards from one of Rome's sponsors, O'Reilly Auto Parts. Friday episodes include the week rewind, known as \\"Alvin Delloro's Week that Was\\", which is a compilation of show highlights over the past week alongside a mix of music. From February 11 to March 11, 2009, all of Rome's shows contained an interview with an individual with the given name Rex. The Smack-Off The Smack-Off is an annual competition on the show. It differs from every other show during the year in that there are no scheduled guests or takes from Rome. The entire show features the best callers on the show and serves as a way of determining the best caller in a given year. The event is invite only. Callers may qualify in a number of ways: *past winners (along with some other long-time veteran callers) receive a life-time invite (they are allowed to go the entire year or even years without calling and would still be allowed to call that day) *building a body of work over a given year (there is no specific criteria but this typically involves getting numerous racked calls leading up to that year's event) *one-great call that blows Rome away (this is referred to as \\"ripping a golden ticket\\") *from 2010 to 2012, the winner of the Hack-Off received an automatic invitation However, making a bad call could lose someone their invitation. Also, receiving an invite does not guarantee the caller will be able to get on the air. The Smack-Off is known as the most important day of the year in The Jungle. It is typically held in spring or early summer and is always on a Friday. It has been held annually since 1995. In addition to receiving the prestige of being the best caller in that given year, recent winners have also received a prize package. The 2015 and 2016 winner received a $5,000 grand prize. While receiving input from the listeners, the winner is picked solely by the XR4TI and is announced in the last segment of the show. There is no strict time limit, but Rome will run a caller if they start rambling too long. The winning criteria is subjective, as there are no set rules or criteria. However, the winning call is typically the person who comes up with some original smack for the other top callers, mixes in some sports takes, and brings something new to the event. The Hack-Off In 2010, as a complement to his annual show entitled The Smack-Off (which features the best callers on the show), Rome instituted The Hack-Off (which features the worst callers on the show). It was typically held a week before The Smack-Off, with the winner earning an automatic entry into that event. It was initially referred to as the \\"Eddie in Boise Invitational\\". Some of the more popular callers included Vinnie Mac, Matt in Cleveland (aka Tarzan), Eddie in Boise, Ryan in Wichita, Ray Ray in Tampa, Jolene in Farmington, and Jason (the star- linebacker) in Ottawa. It is still unclear if the winner of the event was the \\"worst of the worst\\" or the \\"best of the worst\\". Much to everyone's disappointment, Rome decided to cancel the Hack-off after the 2013 event. Despite the efforts of numerous clones, Rome has maintained his stance that the event will not return. Past Winners: *2010: Vinnie Mac in Des Moines *2011: Ray Ray in Tampa *2012: Jolene in Farmington *2013: No Winner Guest hosts At length he announces when he is going to be \\"in the basement\\" (on vacation) and for how long. He justifies his frequent absences to the Clones by proclaiming, \\"I take a lot of vacation because I get a lot of vacation\\" (a parody of a comment made by Patrick Ewing during the 1998 NBA lockout). To ensure live content on days when Rome is absent, The Jim Rome Show is hosted by a rotating stable of guest hosts, including: * KLAC/Fox Sports Radio radio personalities Petros Papadakis and Matt \\"Money\\" Smith. The pair, who host an afternoon show for the sports-talk radio station and Jim Rome Show affiliate, filled in for Rome on Presidents Day 2007 and during Fourth of July week that same year. They now fill at least one day each time Rome takes a week of vacation. They have also appeared on Jim Rome Is Burning. * Comedian Jay Mohr. Mohr also occasionally calls in to Rome's show. He participated in the 2007 Smack-Off and finished in 7th place. When he appears in The Jungle, Mohr is referred to as \\"Slam Man\\". As of 2010, Mohr has become the most frequent guest host. He is now the host of a Fox Sports Radio program, Jay Mohr Sports, competing in the time slot of The Jim Rome Show. * Pop culturists Randy and Jason Sklar (of the ESPN Classic program Cheap Seats), whose subject matters are rather random. Randy is also a frequent panel guest on Rome's ESPN program Jim Rome Is Burning. The Brothers Sklar often date themselves with their frequent discussions on 1980s athletes of professional tennis, professional wrestling and the St. Louis Cardinals. Bumper music when the Sklars host tends to be of the indie rock variety. In 2010 the Sklars became more frequent guest hosts as they launched a podcast with a similar format to their hosting of the Jim Rome Show. They call clones who are fans of theirs \\"sklones\\". * Author and columnist John Feinstein. Feinstein's appearances are usually low-key in tone and dominated by interviews. He also appears frequently on the show as the subject of a Rome interview. * Sportswriter Skip Bayless. When Bayless hosts, the show generally has a recurring theme, typical examples being his belief that the Ohio State Buckeyes stole the 2003 BCS Championship, his self- proclaimed addiction to Diet Mountain Dew, and his obsession with the beach volleyball scene in Top Gun (which Rome shares). Bayless also actively debates callers, as opposed to Rome, who rarely does so. Bayless is a polarizing and unpopular guest host, and many Clones call him \\"Skip Clueless.\\" Rome, for his part, has no problem with Bayless and occasionally needles the Clones with the news that Bayless will be guest-hosting. Bayless has hosted the show less frequently since joining the cast of Cold Pizza/ESPN First Take. * Former ESPN anchor and current NFL Network personality Rich Eisen. Eisen once commented that he had always thought the show's email address was \\"rome@habitate.com\\" until he guest-hosted. (The actual address is rome@haveatake.com, but Rome tends to say \\"haveatake\\" quickly.) * Roger Lodge, host of Blind Date and a frequent interview guest on The Jim Rome Show. Lodge is also a frequent panel guest on Rome's ESPN program Jim Rome Is Burning. On both of Jim's shows, Lodge has taken to making the guarantee to shave his head, should a specific outcome occur. This is a guarantee that Lodge has always failed to follow through on. * Former WDFN radio personalities Mike \\"Stoney\\" Stone and Bob \\"Wojo\\" Wojnowski. The pair, who hosted an afternoon show for the Detroit sports-talk radio station and Jim Rome affiliate, filled in for Rome on July 13, 2007. Stone has also appeared occasionally as a subject of Rome interviews. * Kansas City Star sportswriter Jason Whitlock, who has also appeared as a subject of Rome's interviews. * Grant Napear, play-by-play announcer for the Sacramento Kings and sportscaster for KHTK-AM in Sacramento. Former guest hosts of the show include: * Boxing/Olympic analyst Jim Lampley. Lampley has been known to blast emailers for poor grammar and overall stupidity. Rome sometimes resets a Lampley rant in which he ridiculed the \\"media-driven hype\\" surrounding the year 2000 and how it was erroneously referred to as the beginning of the new millennium. Lampley has not hosted the show since being arrested in January 2007. * Fox Sports Radio personality Andrew Siciliano (from Gametime Live). On May 12, 2006, while Siciliano was guest-hosting, a caller coined the term \\"teammateship\\" (referencing Barry Bonds as an example of bad \\"teammateship\\"). Andrew is referred to as \\"Van Whack\\", \\"Substitute Jim\\", or \\"Rome Junior\\" by many of the Clones, and as \\"Deep Dish\\" by Randy and Jason Sklar. Siciliano now hosts his own show with ex-Laker great Mychal Thompson on L.A's KSPN 710 (AM), which competes with the show, so he no longer has fill-in duty. However, Siciliano is a frequent panel guest on Rome's ESPN program Jim Rome Is Burning. * Actors Jerry Ferrara and Kevin Connolly from HBO's Entourage hosted the show on August 15, 2007. The idea for Ferrara to host the show came about in an interview two weeks prior to Ferrara's guest-hosting, when Rome offered Ferrara a guest-host spot next time he goes on vacation, and Ferrara indicated his willingness to fill in as host. * Fox Sports Radio personality Steve Czaban. He hosted several consecutive days in 2001 when Rome's son Jake was born, but no longer guest-hosts. * Former author, journalist, and columnist Ralph Wiley also guest hosted shows for Rome before he died in 2004. On holidays, the show airs \\"The Best of the Jim Rome Show\\", a retrospective episode of memorable interviews and segments. Future of the show Since its inception, The Jim Rome Show has always been offered on terrestrial radio, and has not been offered on satellite radio. The show is, however, offered on streaming and podcast through the official web site. On May 6, 2003, Rome made a return to television with Jim Rome Is Burning on ESPN, and occasionally hinted about switching the radio program to satellite, or abandoning the radio program altogether, in favor of television full-time. Rome is often quite vocal about his frequent displeasures with affiliates, specifically those who do not carry the entire three hours, air the show on tape delay, or frequently pre-empt the broadcast. Rome has openly admitted that he is intrigued by the idea of satellite radio and broadcasting the program free of affiliates' interference. However, he is also aware of some listeners' problems with paying for satellite radio, and has received numerous phone calls and e-mails from terrestrial radio listeners who have said that the humor of the show has brought them through difficult times or keeps them entertained at work. On April 27, 2006, Rome stated that he will keep the radio program going, but initially made no commitment to satellite or terrestrial. On July 11, 2006, Rome announced that he signed a multi-year deal with Premiere Radio Networks to keep the show on terrestrial radio. In addition, he stated that the show may be simulcast on satellite radio in the future. Clear Channel provides content exclusively to XM Satellite Radio, including the entire Fox Sports Radio network. In January 2013, the show moved to the CBS Sports Radio network. In October 2017, CBS Sports Network announced that it would add a simulcast of The Jim Rome Show to its afternoon lineup beginning January 2, 2018.

During his career he is best known for his appearances with Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Aston Villa and was capped twice for England. Charles was most recently the manager of Nuneaton Town. Playing career Born in Newham, London, Charles started his career at Clapton F.C., but first came into notability at Nottingham Forest, when he became a regular alongside Roy Keane, making his debut on 7 November 1987. Due to his colour and skills, he was dubbed the Brazilian. His manager at Forest, Brian Clough, commented on his dribbling abilities by saying: \\"When he plays a one-two he goes like a gazelle. It's so effortless that at first it looks as if he's not moving, yet he's 40 yards up the field. In June 1991, he made his debut for England, playing two friendlies, against New Zealand on 8 June and Malaysia on 12 June. Only a few days earlier, Charles was famously fouled by Paul Gascoigne in the 1991 FA Cup Final. This was the challenge that caused Gascoigne's cruciate ligaments to tear, forcing him out of the game for several months. On 29 March 1992, he made the squad that won the Full Members Cup against Southampton. On 29 July 1993, he made a ¬£750,000 move to Derby County, appearing 76 times for them during a two-year spell, which included honours for PFA Team of the Year in 1993‚Äì94. On 6 January 1995, he signed with Aston Villa for a fee close to ¬£1.4m, and assumed a regular starting role, although he was frequently injured, being out for two seasons recovering from a serious ankle injury. He appeared in 80 league matches in three and half years with the Villans, winning one League Cup. On 14 January 1999, Charles moved abroad, joining Benfica in Portugal, for a fee of ¬£1m. He was the back- up choice after the failed bid for Oleh Luzhny. However, in Portugal, his problem with injuries remained; on 22 January, just six days after arriving, he sustained a sprain in his right hock with rupture of the joint capsule of his knee, being sidelined for two months. He finally made his debut on a 3‚Äì0 home loss against Boavista on 14 March 1999, and played in three more games, scoring one goal, before being sidelined again on late April, due to a pubalgia. Spending the entire summer recovering from injury, he was put on the transfer list by Jupp Heynckes, so he made a move to his boyhood team West Ham United on 5 October 1999 for ¬£1.2m. During the three seasons with the Hammers, he was constantly out by injuries so he opted to end his professional career on 29 July 2002. Coaching career In October 2011, Charles joined Lincoln City as Assistant Manager alongside manager David Holdsworth, but has since become the Director of Football at the University of Nottingham. On 29 March 2018 it was announced that he had accepted the manager's position at National League North side Nuneaton Town. In June 2018, he was replaced as manager at Nuneaton by Nicky Eaden. Personal life After the end of his playing career, Charles struggled with alcoholism. He however overcame these difficulties and has attained his UEFA A Coaching licence. In 2018, Charles was reported as being a recovering alcoholic with a business providing care to people who are experiencing depression and alcohol and drug dependency.

Media career After the war, Webster emigrated to Canada. He covered the labour beat for the Vancouver Sun newspaper. In 1953, he began to work on commercial radio in the talk radio format, which had its origins in British Columbia before it spread to the United States. Webster made his mark broadcasting shorthand transcripts of testimony during a probe into corruption on Vancouver's police force. His City Mike show on CJOR achieved some fame covering the issue. He left CJOR and moved his show to CKNW. In the 1960s, he had 186,000 daily listeners and a $100,000 salary. In 1963, prisoners at the BC Penitentiary were foiled in an escape attempt and took hostages. At the prisoners' request, Webster acted as a mediator between hostage-holding prisoners and the authorities and helped resolve the stand-off. In 1972, Jim Pattison lured Webster back to CJOR. Then in 1979, at the age of 60, Webster moved his radio show to television, where his familiar expression '9 am prrre-cisely' became his trademark. His hour- long TV interview program Webster!, which was seen weekdays at 9 am on BCTV and then-sister CHEK-TV and from 1986, at 5pm proceeding the nightly news hour on BCTV, frequently dealt with British Columbia politics. Shortly after the final BCTV show aired in April 1987, Webster and the TV station donated the videos for all nine years of his shows to the BC Archives. In 1990, Webster joined the long-running CBC TV program Front Page Challenge as its permanent fourth panelist until the show's cancellation in 1995. Recognition In 1987, he was inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame. In 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 2017, the 150th anniversary of Canada, Webster was profiled in Vancouver newspapers as one of the most notable 150 British Columbians. Jack Webster Foundation In 1986, more than 1000 people attended a salute to Webster upon his retirement. This event resulted in the creation of the Jack Webster FoundationJack Webster Foundation to promote and honour excellence in journalism in British Columbia. Each year, journalists judged to have outstanding work receive a Jack Webster Award (known as a \\"Webster\\"), a glass statue and a cash prize that has become the hallmark of journalistic excellence in British Columbia. The awards have grown from a single \\"Reporter of the Year\\" in 1987 to thirteen awards today for best news, best feature and best community news reporting (print, radio, and TV awards in each of the three categories) as well as recognition for excellence in the categories of business reporting, science reporting, commentary, legal journalism, Chinese-language news, and the Bruce Hutchison Lifetime Achievement Award. The Foundation also awards fellowships and six annual student reporting awards.

Life He was the son of a clergyman and was sent to Harrow. His first attempts at acting were badly received, and it was to his wonderful gift of mimicry that he owed his success. His imitations, however, naturally gave offence to the important actors and managers whose peculiarities he hit off to the life. Garrick, Peg Woffington, Samuel Foote and Sheridan, after being delighted with the imitations of the others, were among the most angry when it came to their turn, and threatened never to forgive him. Garrick never did. As an actor, Wilkinson was most successful in Foote's plays, but his list of parts was a long one. In Shakespearian characters he was very popular in the provinces. In 1766 he became a partner of Joseph Baker in the management of several Yorkshire theatres, and married about 1768. He became sole manager after his partner's death in 1770 of a number of theatres on what was then called the Yorkshire Circuit, and he was both liberal and successful. The Theatre, Leeds, built to his order in 1771, was part of the circuit.Leodis, Discovering Leeds: The Theatre Retrieved 17 December 2013 In 1769 he took over York Theatre Royal, where he also had living quarters. An engraving of him in the role of Mr Popeseye was made; copies can be found in the Murray collection within the York City Archive held at the central York Library. Wilkinson directed with excellent judgment and prosperity for over 30 years.

It is operated as a private non-profit organization, which leased the site from the city in the early 1960s. Stephen D. Bloom has been the chief executive officer of the Portland Japanese Garden since 2005.  Features  The Portland Japanese Garden is composed of eight garden spaces and a Cultural Village. * The Strolling Pond Garden is the largest and contains multiple areas. A creek flows under a moon bridge to connect the upper and lower ponds. The lower pond is home to many koi and a viewpoint for the beautiful Heavenly Falls. There is a 100-year-old five-tiered pagoda lantern, a gift from Portland's sister city of Sapporo with ornamental rocks forming the shape of Hokkaid≈ç island and a red stone for Sapporo. * The Natural Garden has multiple ponds, waterfalls, and streams. Trees, shrubs, ferns, and mosses grow in their natural state. * The Sand and Stone Garden contains weathered stones rising from rippled sand suggestive of the water. The tranquil rake patterns are often present in karesansui (Japanese rock gardens). * The Flat Garden is typical of a daimy≈ç (feudal lord)'s villa garden, and its Pavilion is reminiscent of the Kamakura period architectural style. Raked white sand represents water and vividly contrasts with maple trees, moss, evergreens, and azaleas. * The Tea Garden has two areas, each devoted to enhancing the tea ceremony: an outer waiting area and an inner garden surrounding the authentic tea house, constructed in Japan by Kajima Construction Company and assembled onsite in 1968. In 2017, the Cultural Crossing expansion added three new Garden spaces. * The Entry Garden is home to a series of cascading ponds welcome visitors. The garden continues along a zigzagged walk up a terraced stone pathway through towering firs and cedars growing naturally along the hillside. * The Ellie M. Hill Bonsai Terrace provides a space for the Garden to showcase seasonal bonsai specimens. The Garden partners with local bonsai practitioners in Portland and from around the region, giving visitors a chance to see a variety of bonsai examples and techniques. * The Tsubo-Niwa is a modern Japanese garden style. This tiny \\"vignette\\" garden incorporates the essential elements of a Japanese garden ‚Äì stone, water, and plants ‚Äì while placing nature as a central focus of the surrounding Cultural Village. The Garden Pavilion was built in 1980 in Japanese style by local builders: it has a tiled roof, wooden verandas, and Sh≈çji sliding doors. It is the center of several Japanese cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and other events. The west veranda faces the Flat Garden, and the east veranda overlooks downtown Portland and Mount Hood, which resembles Mount Fuji. Dozens of stone lanterns are present throughout the garden. The lower entrance features a 100-year-old temple gate, a 1976 gift of the Japanese Ancestral Society of Portland Oregon. As a Japanese garden, the desired effect is to realize a sense of peace, harmony, and tranquility and to experience the feeling of being a part of nature. Three of the essential elements used to create the garden are stone, the \\"bones\\" of the landscape; water, the life-giving force; and plants, the tapestry of the four seasons. Japanese garden designers feel that good stone composition is one of the most important elements in creating a well-designed garden. Secondary elements include pagodas, stone lanterns, water basins, arbors, and bridges. Japanese gardens are asymmetrical in design and reflect nature in idealized form. Traditionally, human scale is maintained throughout so that one always feels part of the environment and not overpowered by it.  History and awards  In 1958, Portland became a sister city of Sapporo, Japan. This inspired Portland business leaders and public officials to create a Japanese garden in Portland. On June 4, 1962, the city council created a commission to establish the garden in Washington Park. The Japanese Garden is built into a forested hillside in Washington Park on land that was previously the site of Portland's zoo until 1959. The garden was designed by Professor Takuma Tono of the Tokyo University of Agriculture. The garden was dedicated and design began in 1963; the garden opened to the public in 1967. In a study conducted in 2013 by the Journal of Japanese Gardening, it was deemed the finest public Japanese garden in North America out of more than 300 such gardens surveyed by Japanese garden experts. The former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, said in 1988 that the garden was ‚Äúthe most beautiful and authentic Japanese garden in the world outside Japan.‚Äù In April 2017, the Garden unveiled its Cultural Crossing expansion project. This $33.5 million expansion added 3.4 acres to the Garden. The addition included three new garden spaces and a Cultural Village, designed by world-renowned architect Kengo Kuma. The Village is home to the Jordan Schnitzer Japanese Arts Learning Center, the Garden House, and the Umami Cafe by Ajinomoto. The new space is used for additional educational and artistic programming and to make room for the 350,000 guests the Garden sees each year. In the Tateuchi courtyard, one can admire a 185-ft-long castle wall traditionally built by a 15th-generation Japanese master stonemason.  Logistics  The Japanese Garden is close to Washington Park's main entrance, at the top of Park Place, just above and a short walk from the International Rose Test Garden. Parking inside Washington Park costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day. TriMet bus route 63-Washington Park stops nearby and runs every day. The Washington Park Shuttle, a free service which connects MAX light rail at the Washington Park station to the Japanese Garden, operates seven days a week from April through October, and on weekends from November through March. Once at the garden, there is a shuttle that runs up the hill frequently. Because the Portland Japanese Garden is a non-profit organization which receives no funding from the city of Portland, there is an admission fee: * Adult $18.95 * Senior (65+) $16.25 * College $15.25 * Youth (6-17) $13.50 * Child (5 and under) Free Members get free admission among other benefits.

Gaston was married to Princess Isabel, heiress to the Brazilian throne.  Early years  Gaston d'Orl√©ans, Count of Eu, at the age of five Gaston was born Louis Philippe Marie Ferdinand Gaston of Orl√©ans (Portuguese: Lu√≠s Filipe Maria Fernando Gast√£o de Orle√£es) on 28 April 1842 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, at the Ch√¢teau de Neuilly. He was the eldest son of Louis, the Duke of Nemours and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His paternal grandparents were King Louis Philippe I, King of the French, and Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies, and his maternal grandparents were Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Princess Maria Antonia von Koh√°ry. A member of the French royal family, Gaston belonged to the House of Orl√©ans, a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, that in turn belonged to the Capetian Dynasty. A Prince of Orl√©ans, he was titled Count of Eu (comte d'Eu) at birth by his grandfather, King Louis Philippe. He was a first cousin once removed of both the British Monarch Queen Victoria and of her husband Albert, Prince Consort, through his mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The prince received a refined education under Julio Gauthier and the historian Auguste Trognon. He learned several foreign languages, which included Latin, English, German and Portuguese. His grandfather abdicated during the Revolution of 1848. Only five years old at the time, Gaston followed the king and his family who went into exile in Great Britain, establishing themselves in an old mansion at Claremont, in the southern region of England. In 1855, at the age of 13, Gaston began his military career in an artillery course, concluding in the Military School of Segovia, Spain, where he became a captain. He had moved to Spain, after following his uncle, Antoine, the Duke of Montpensier's orientation. The Duke had lived there since his marriage to Infanta Luisa Fernanda, sister of Queen Isabel II of Spain.  Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil  Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, c. 1870 After years with problems on the border with Morocco caused by constant attacks on Spanish cities by Moroccan pirates, Spain declared war on Morocco. The young Gaston was sent as a subordinate officer to participate in the conflict on the side of the Spanish forces. The Spanish military consisted of more than 40,000 soldiers, while the Moroccan troops numbered about 140,000 men. The Count participated in all of the battles, and after the end of the conflict he returned to Spain with a reputation for his military prowess. A few years later, his uncle, King Ferdinand II of Portugal proposed that he should marry one of the two daughters of the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. He agreed to accept the proposal, but only after meeting the princesses. The Emperor's sister, Princess Francisca, who was married to the Count's uncle, the Prince of Joinville, wrote a letter to her brother describing the Count. \\"If you could grab this one for one of your daughters it would be excellent. He is robust, high, handsome, good natured, very amiable, much instructed, studious, and in addition, he possesses now a small military fame.\\" Gaston d'Orl√©ans, 1865 Gaston arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 2 September 1864 in the company of his double first cousin, Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and went directly to the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o to meet the Brazilian imperial family. However, Gaston was less than enthusiastic about the two princesses, whom he considered unattractive. Initially, the young Count was promised to Princess Leopoldina and his cousin to Princess Isabel. However, after getting to know them better, the Emperor decided to invert the pairs. Gaston became attached to Isabel. They were married on 15 October 1864. Earlier, Gaston was awarded the Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross and a few days later accepted the honorary presidency of the Brazilian Geographic and Historical Institute. In 1892, Alfredo d'Escragnolle, the viscount of Taunay, gave his opinion regarding the two cousins when they first arrived in Brazil. He said that the duke of Saxe \\"had only interest in spending his life in a lazy and amusing way, he liked a lot of hunting and appreciated a lot the many joys that existed in Europe, while the comte d'Eu with all the defects that I can point at him, cared sincerely and a lot for Brazil and, believe it or not, he still loves it today with intensity and no second intention.\\"  Paraguayan War  War against Paraguay: The Emperor of Brazil with his two sons-in-law, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Count of Eu, in Alegrete, southern Brazil (L'Illustration journal universel, Vol. XLVL, n¬∫ 1.186, 1865). Gaston and Isabel were travelling in Europe on their honeymoon when Paraguayan forces invaded the Brazilian provinces of Mato Grosso and Rio Grande Do Sul. From the city of Uruguaiana in the southern region of Brazil, Pedro II sent a letter to the couple requesting Gaston's presence in Brazil, directing the Count to join him and the Brazilian army, together with the Duke of Saxe. Uruguaiana had been conquered by the Paraguayan army. The Conde d'Eu, and the Emperor, Pedro II of Brazil, joined President Bartolom√© Mitre of Argentina in the Siege of Uruguaiana, which ended 18 September 1865.Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, In his memoirs, the Visconde of Taunay wrote of his experience in the Paraguayan War, along with observances of his fellow soldiers. \\"While Gaston showed in all occasions a great interest for the things of Brazil, observing, asking, visiting all the places and going after correct and accurate information, while the other [August Luis, duke of Saxe] did not show anything except for indifference and lack of ambition.\\" He was later nominated general commander of the artillery and president of the Commission of Improvements of the Army on 19 November 1865. On two occasions throughout the conflict, Gaston sent requests to the Emperor asking him to authorize his participation in the war against Paraguay. The Council of State declined his request. The rationale was a strategic act, believing that the presence of a prince in the conflict would escalate the desire to conquer their country's territories. Additionally, it was unacceptable for the husband of the heiress of the throne to subordinate to a Brazilian military officer, who, at this time, was Luis Alves de Lima and Silva, the Marquis of Caxias, the just-nominated allied commander-in-chief. Gaston d'Orl√©ans, Count of Eu, at the age of 28 On 22 March 1869, Gaston was assigned to lead as commander- in-chief of the allied armies, after the Marquis of Caxias renounced that position. This delegation of authority was based on the prestige as an officer of high rank, as well as his reputation and well-known capacity in military action. The choice of Gaston as the new commander-in-chief, at the age of 27, brought joy to the Brazilian public. During this time, the opinion of a great number of Brazilian citizens believed that the conflict and continued hunt for Francisco Solano L√≥pez the Paraguayan dictator, was futile and unnecessary. Gaston shared this belief. When he arrived at Paraguay, he reorganized the Brazilian army and fired the officers accused of pillage in enemy territory. He used diversified tactics to deceive the Paraguayan army about how and where the allied army would carry its attacks. In the opinion of the Viscount of Taunay, Gaston showed \\"great strategical ability, cool temper, patience of an experienced leader and unquestionable courage.\\" He also participated actively in the battles that occurred, in the Battle of Acosta √ëu, where he suffered great risk of life. It was the Count's idea to definitively extinguish the slavery of approximately 25,000 individuals in Paraguay, many of whom were obliged to fight in the war against the Triple Alliance. Gaston suffered heavy criticism after he discovered that the brigadier Jo√£o Manuel Mena Barreto had died in the battle that resulted in the conquest of the village of Piribebuy (Battle of Piribebuy) which at that time was named \\"the third capital of Paraguay\\" after the occupation of Asunci√≥n and Luque earlier in 1868. He was also criticized for ordering the decapitation of commander Pedro Pablo Caballero and Patricio Marecos, head politician of the village. In September, the Count became greatly depressed, due to the high number of deaths caused by the conflict. Until the end of the war on 1 March 1870, he participated nominally in the action of the allied army. When he returned to Brazil on 29 April 1870, he was received as a war hero. He was also nominated as a member of the Council of State on 6 July of the same year. = Modern critics to Gaston d'Orl√©ans in the war = The painting represents the moment when the Count of Eu is unable to continue the attack against the Paraguayans by his aide-de-camp, Captain Almeida Castro, who holds the reins of the horse ridden by Gaston. After the 1960s, revisionist historians appeared, portraying the Gaston d'Orl√©ans as a bloodthirsty mass murderer. Some historians, like J√∫lio Jose Chiavenato, accuse him of having committed war crimes and being most interested in engaging in war, if only to pursue L√≥pez. Revisionist historians also accuse Gaston of having ordered a grass fire, in order to asphyxiate wounded Paraguayan soldiers who were still in the field after the battle of Acosta √ëu. Chiavenato uses as a source, the memoirs of the Viscount of Taunay. Recently, it has been found that the memoirs say something completely different. \\"There were bullets that still blew up in the field because of the fire in the grass that was started in the beginning of the battle by the Paraguayans to occult their tactical movement.\\" There is a mention of an episode, where Gaston ordered the troops to set fire in a hospital full of wounded Paraguayan soldiers that resulted in the death of more than a hundred victims. However, the hospital may have been collateral damage caused by allied bombardment at the beginning of the battle, directed on the Paraguayan military defense and not as the result of a deliberate desire of killing defenseless people.  Family life  From left to right: Gaston, Pedro, Antonio, Isabel and Lu√≠s Although initially disillusioned with the seeming lack of beauty of his wife, Gaston came to love her until the last days of his life, a feeling returned by Isabel. The birth of their son, Pedro, on 15 October 1875, brought much happiness for the couple, who for almost ten years had been unable to conceive. The arrival of their son also served to lighten the pain of the loss of their first child, Luisa Victoria, who died due to complications of childbirth on 28 July 1874. Although crippled by a defect in the left arm caused by problems in childbirth, Pedro was a very healthy child and would be affectionately called \\"Baby\\" by his parents, even as a young adult. The Count always treated his wife with patience, pleasantness and determination to help her pass through the depression she suffered from, presuming that she somehow could have avoided Pedro's birth defect. His happiness became visible in the letter that he wrote to his father soon after the birth of his third child, in which he stated, \\"We are really happy, grateful and glad. Having two healthy children after so many misfortunes that made me lose any hope of becoming a father, exceeds what I dared myself to expect.\\" Their third child was a son, Luiz de Orl√©ans e Bragan√ßa, born 26 January 1878 and named after Gaston's father. Some years later, this child became Isabel's heir, after his elder brother renounced his succession to the throne. Antonio was the fourth and last son, born on 9 August 1881 in Paris, where the couple had lived for three years. Antonio was nicknamed \\"Tot√≥\\" by his family. The Count was a very simple person and tried to pass this characteristic on to his children. He had a complete aversion to the lifestyle of European nobility and royalty, which he called \\"futile\\" and \\"stupid\\". In 1882, Gaston chose Benjamin Franklin Ramiz Galv√£o, a professor at the School of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro and headmaster of the National Library, to educate his children. The prince recognized the professor's merit and did not care that Benjamin was a republican. Gaston and his wife provided their children with a simple education, allowing them to study at the father Moreira's school in Petropolis, and later at the school Pedro II.  Life as Prince-Consort  Gaston d'Orl√©ans, the count of Eu, surrounded by a crowd on his arrival to the northern region of Brazil. Following his marriage to Isabel, Gaston participated actively in the Brazilian government, making commentaries and offering advice about the development of the country. The idea of living as a mere shadow to his wife deeply dissatisfied him. However, Pedro II never allowed either Gaston nor Isabel to participate in the decisions of the government, and refused to discuss state matters with the couple in any form. This line of demarcation created serious discord between Gaston and his father-in-law, almost to the point of disruption had not Isabel interceded. She attempted to mediate the misunderstandings between the emperor and her husband. As time passed, Gaston became used to the idea of not having any power. It was 1889, before he was able to constructively discuss politics with his father-in-law for the first time. Gaston's exclusion from the Brazilian political arena necessitated the pursuit of alternate activities. He and his wife turned their attention toward philanthropic endeavors, choosing to support several charities and social institutions. Jos√© Avelino, who participated in the first Brazilian republican constituent, years after the end of the monarchy made several remarks about the Count of Eu. :Whatever was possible to make him earn the title of Brazilian he made it: regulations, projects of law for better organization of the Army and perfecting of its material of war; schools, libraries, orphanages for the abandoned children; everything that could help the unprotected or the diverse groups of the society, he planned or executed for the most part. Gaston visited almost all of the provinces of the country, more than any other member of the Imperial Family. He travelled to the southern region, as well as the northeast and the far north of Brazil. By the end of the Empire, he made a great trip to the north of Brazil being very well received by all, showing that the monarchy was still popular. After he returned from the Paraguayan War as Marshal-of-the- Army, he became a member of several foreign and Brazilian associations. He was decorated with the medal of the Surrender of Uruguaiana; the Military Merit; the Campaign of Africa and the grand-crosses of Ernest Pious of Saxony; the Orders of the Tower and Sword of the Value, Loyalty and Merit of Christ and of Saint Bento of Avis of Portugal; the order of Leopold of Belgium; the Order of the Red Eagle of Mexico; and was made a knight of the Order of Saint Fernando of Spain.  Later years  = End of the Brazilian monarchy = Military training, 1888. The Count of Eu (mounted, at the middle) was incapable of putting any effective resistance to the republican coup that occurred on 15 November 1889, despite the support of loyal Army officers. Little did Gaston (first roll, third from left to right) know that the Republican leader, Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca (to his left), blamed him for the crisis between the government and insubordinate officers.

Gaston was one of the few eyewitnesses of the military coup d'Et√°t that overthrew the Empire who left written memoirs of it. His three letters ‚Äì written while he was still in Rio and later aboard the ship that was taking the Imperial family to exile ‚Äì gives a detailed account of the coup and are one of the main primary sources used by historians. At the night of 14 November 1889 Gaston was in Rio de Janeiro in his home making the preparations to a reception in honor of Chilean Navy officers visiting the city. A Brazilian major came to warn him of something important, but being too busy and not told of how grave the matter was, Gaston did not meet him. At 8 am of the next day, 15 November, he went to ride with his sons in Botafogo (a neighborhood in Rio) \\"with no preoccupation at all\\", in his own words. Upon his return, he read all Rio's newspapers and only one mentioned that apparently a mutiny had occurred in the Military Academy and the Cabinet had met to deal with the matter. Little did Gaston know that a rebellion among the Army corps ‚Äì led by Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca ‚Äì had removed from power by force the Cabinet the night before. Around 9h30 and 10h a.m. Gaston was told by two officers of what had happened. Soon others, including military officers, arrived \\"with confusing news\\". Upon hearing, Gaston commented: \\"In this case, the monarchy has ended.\\" Nonetheless, he dressed himself in his uniform of Marshal of the Army, hoping that it could make the rebels change theirs minds upon seeing their former commander-in-chief in Paraguay. But soon changed back to his civilian clothes when others around him suggested that it would be useless. Senator Manuel Pinto de Sousa Dantas, a former prime minister, later appeared and told him not to worry and gave his support to the monarchy. Lieutenant Andr√© Rebou√ßas, embraced him and told of a plan he had envisioned with Major Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay, to leave to the nearby city of Petr√≥polis where they could resist the coup. Gaston agreed and tried to reach the telegraph central by telephone to request it to tell Emperor Pedro II to stay in Petr√≥polis. At that point, however, the republicans had taken control of the telegraph central. Nonetheless, a telegraph message informed them that the Emperor was arriving in Rio. Gaston sent his children to Petr√≥polis where he believed they would be safe. Gaston, his wife Isabel and many others, met Pedro II in the City Palace, located in Rio downtown. It was already afternoon and Deodoro da Fonseca as well as the other rebels had returned to their homes. Unbeknownst to Gaston, Deodoro had not overthrown the Emperor, but only the Cabinet and the rebellion seemed to be all over. Pedro II told the prince that he was going to dissolve the rebel battalions. Gaston, far more realistic, complained that the rebels would not simply put their arms down by themselves. He also urged the monarch to form a new cabinet, since the country was effectively without a government. Pedro II did not bother, and told him that he would wait for the prime minister Viscount of Ouro Preto. \\"But the ministers are prisoners of the rebels: how does Your Majesty wants them to able to continue to govern?\\", asked the Prince. No matter what Gaston or the politicians and army officers told him, Pedro II did nothing nor allowed anyone to do anything during those precious hours. Tired of waiting, Gaston requested the presence of all Counselors of State to discuss the present and serious situation. As the Emperor refused to meet them, some of the counselors simply gave up and departed. The ones who stood agreed to send an envoy to Deodoro to make peace with him. A major was sent and met with the rebel leader in his home at 3 am of 16 November, lying down in his bed, very sick. Deodoro told him that now was too late and he had made his mind and that the monarchy was over. And he also accused Gaston of being the one responsible for what the rebels regarded as harassment from the government against the Army. That revealed how successful had been the republican propaganda against the prince, who held absolutely no influence or power in the government. The Imperial family was banished and departed to Europe on 17 November. Despite the lack of any will to resist from Pedro II, there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the empire, which was thoroughly repressed. = Exile = On 15 November 1889 the Republic was proclaimed in Brazil. The Imperial family was forced into exile, first in Portugal and later in Normandy, at the Ch√¢teau d'Eu. In 1891, Emperor Pedro II died in Paris and his daughter became Empress \\"Isabel I of Brazil\\" to the Brazilian Monarchists while, at the same time, the Count of Eu then became Emperor consort. But these titles had little weight and both spouses remained banished from their country. = Return to Brazil and death = It was only in 1921 already as a widower that the Count of Eu could finally set foot back in Brazil. At this occasion he retrieved the bodies of his parents-in-law to bury in the Imperial Mausoleum of the Cathedral of Petr√≥polis. The following year, the Count of Eu eventually died a natural death out at sea on the coast of Brazil on August 28, 1922 during a journey that would take him back to Brazil to celebrate the first centenary of independence. His body and that of Princess Isabel returned to Brazil together on 7 July 1953, to be buried in the Imperial Mausoleum of the Cathedral of Petr√≥polis on 12 May 1971.

Italy is considered to be part of the wine belt of Europe. Nevertheless, beer, particularly mass-produced pale lagers, are common in the country. It is traditionally considered to be an ideal accompaniment to pizza; since the 1970s, beer has spread from pizzerias and has become much more popular for drinking in other situations. In the seventh century BC in Sicily, the Phoenicians traded and consumed beer. In Piedmont, Pombia, Province of Novara, an archaeological investigation found tombs from the Golasecca culture, including a tomb from 560 BC containing traces of beer. Ancient Rome knew of beer and produced small amounts, but the systems of production were destroyed in various barbarian invasions. The first medical school, the Schola Medica Salernitana, praised the substance stating that it \\"supports old age, flows through the veins, increases well-being, and strengthens the blood.\\" On the occasion of his wedding, Ludovico Sforza distributed beer freely to the Milanese. At this time, it was referred to in Florence as \\"barley wine\\". The first brewery in Italy, according to Hermes Zampollo, was \\"Spluga\\" in Chiavenna, which opened in 1840. However, the company W√ºhrer stated that its brewing commenced in Brescia in 1829. The first person in Italy to cultivate hops for beer brewing was Gaetano Pasqui in 1847. In 1983, the country consumed 12 million hectoliters of beer. As of 2010, Italy has a beer consumption of 30 litres per capita per year.

It is located to the west of downtown and bordered by the Ottawa River to the north, the O-Train Trillium Line to the east, Scott Street to the south, and Parkdale Avenue to the west. East of Mechanicsville is LeBreton Flats, Tunney's Pasture is directly west, and Hintonburg is to the south. The total population of the neighbourhood as of the 2011 Census was 2,205.Population calculated by combining Dissemination Areas 35060389, 35060388, 35060387, 35060385 and 35060386 History Plan of subdivision was prepared and certified by Robert Sparks, P.L.Surveyor in 1872, it being the property of Mrs T.M. Blasdel & A.H.Baldwin Esq, and certified as a true copy of plan 35A, 7 June 1976 by the Assistant Examiner of surveys. The Village of Mechanicsville being part of Lot 36 Concession A of Nepean. The limits were (Burnside) to the north and running down to the Ottawa River at the Sluce cutting; First street on the east (Stonehurst Avenue); Road allowance and the Canada Central Railway to the south (Scott Street); Fifth Street (Parkdale Avenue) to the west. The first modest houses were probably built about 1875. They were of wood balloon frame covered with 1x12 inch planks inside and out with wood or other siding, with the foundations projecting four inches beyond the edge of the finished frame to take a brick finish as people became able to afford this luxury. The area was annexed to the city of Ottawa in 1911. Some sources suggest that the name Mechanicsville arose after this annexation because it became home to blue collar workers, especially those who worked in the rail yards, or lumber and paper mills who had been displaced by the Great Fire of 1900. In fact, Mechanicsville was known by that name as early as 1879 when it was shown in Belden's Historical Atlas of Carleton County in Nepean Twp., being part of Lot 36 in Concession A, Ottawa Front. Mechanicsville in 1879 was considerably smaller than the present day Ottawa neighbourhood. Its western boundary was then the present-day Parkdale Avenue. In the 1950s and 1960s, when what is now known as the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway (formerly the Ottawa River Parkway) was being developed by the National Capital Commission, large sections of the neighbourhood along the river were expropriated and demolished. While this created green space, the parkway and on and off-ramps at Parkdale Avenue have also created a barrier to the waterfront. In the 1970s and 1980s, expansion of Scott Street, and the development of the Transitway along the old rail line on Scott has served to cut off the area from the area south of Scott, which was at one time, considered part of the Mechanicsville neighbourhood. Area character The area is mostly residential, of wood-frame/wood siding 1900s era homes on grid streets. Along Parkdale Avenue, there are several newer highrise apartment buildings. To the east is an older industrial area along Bayview. The neighbourhood has good bus access and has experienced infilling of town homes in recent years. These include both low and high income housing. In 2007 a serious fire affected some high density social housing and the neighbourhood helped the victims of this fire. Prominent landmarks include the Protection of the Holy Virgin Memorial Church and the Embassy of Indonesia.

It is the only law school in the state and was founded in 1973 by Robert H. Rines as the Franklin Pierce Law Center, named after the 14th President of the United States and New Hampshire native. The school is particularly well known for its Intellectual Property Law program. On April 27, 2010, Franklin Pierce Law Center formally signed an agreement to affiliate with the University of New Hampshire. (Press release.) History The school was originally named for Franklin Pierce, 14th US president. The University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law was founded in 1973 as the Franklin Pierce Law Center, becoming the first law school in New Hampshire. On April 27, 2010, Franklin Pierce Law Center formally signed an affiliation agreement with the University of New Hampshire. The school was renamed the University of New Hampshire School of Law when the affiliation became effective. At the alumni reception during the INTA Annual Meeting in 2019, Dean Carpenter announced the incorporation of \\"Franklin Pierce\\" back into the school's name. The school was renamed the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law. As of 2018, among all ranked law schools in the United States, UNH Law is 85th. The school has been among the top 10 intellectual property law schools in the United States for the past 25 years. In its 2019 ranking of \\"America's Best Intellectual Property Law Programs\\", U.S. News & World Report ranked UNH Law's program 5th in the nation in the intellectual property specialty rankings. Most recently, the school was ranked 48th by Above the Law's 2018 rankings which are outcome (i.e. bar passage rate and employment results) oriented.

Canada Under Part II of the Canadian Criminal Code (Offences Against Public Order),\\"An unlawful assembly is an assembly of three or more persons who, with intent to carry out any common purpose, assemble in such a manner or so conduct themselves when they are assembled as to cause persons in the neighbourhood of the assembly to fear, on reasonable grounds, that they (a) will disturb the peace tumultuously; or (b) will by that assembly needlessly and without reasonable cause provoke other persons to disturb the peace tumultuously.\\" England By the 19th century, unlawful assembly, a term used in English law, described a gathering of three or more people with intent to commit a crime by force, or to carry out a common purpose (whether lawful or unlawful), in such a manner or in such circumstances as would in the opinion of firm and rational men endanger the public peace or create fear of immediate danger to the tranquillity of the neighborhood. A reform commission in 1879 believed that what underlay the first on-point legislation of 1328, outlining when such a crime was recognised nationally (still to adjudged by or via a justice of the peace) was certain landed proprietors at loggerheads employing a band of violent armed retainers, above the traditional manorial bailiffs. In the Year Book, a legal text, of the third year of Henry VII's reign, assemblies were expressed as not punishable unless in terrorem: populi domini regis, a threat to the people, God or the King. In 1882 it was ruled that, on balance, an unlawful assembly would need to be more than participants knowing beforehand of likely formal opposition and the mere prospect of a breach of the peace; by this date a quiltwork of cases had identified certain rights to orderly, lawful protest. All people may, and must if called upon to do so, assist in dispersing an unlawful assembly. An assembly which was lawful could not be rendered unlawful by (court) proclamation unless it were one authorized by statute. Cementing the English Bill of Rights 1689 banning private armies, meetings for training or drilling, or military movements, were from 1820 unlawful assemblies unless held under lawful authority from the Crown, the Lord-lieutenant, or two justices of the peace. An unlawful assembly which had made a motion towards its common purpose was termed a rout, if it carried out all or part of its end purpose, e.g., beginning to demolish an enclosure, it became a riot. All three offences were misdemeanours in English law, punishable by fine and imprisonment. The first of these three offences was abolished by the Public Order Act 1986 for two parts of the UK, the most recent major reform of public order offences, the other two parts having similar legislation. The common law as to unlawful assembly extended to Ireland, subject to special legislation. The law of Scotland included unlawful assembly under the same head as rioting. Hong Kong The Public Order Ordinance (chapter 245 of the laws of Hong Kong) defines \\"unlawful assembly\\" (¬ß18) as an assembly of three or more people conducting themselves in a \\"disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative manner intended or likely to cause a person reasonably to fear that the people so assembled will conduct a breach of the peace or will by such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace\\". people taking part in unlawful assemblies can be punished with up to five years' imprisonment (if indicted) or a level 2 fine (HK$5000) and imprisonment for three years (on summary conviction). India Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of 1973 empowers an executive magistrate to issue orders in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. Though the scope of Section 144 is wider, it is often used to prohibit assembly of one or more persons when unrest is anticipated. Section 129 of the CrPC grants Executive Magistrates and Police officers in charge of a police station and above the power to order dispersal of, disperse and cause to be dispersed any unlawful assembly. Section 130 authorizes an Executive Magistrate to obtain the aid of the Armed Forces to disperse any such assembly, and Section 131 grants any Gazetted Officer of the Armed Forces the power to use his troops to disperse a manifestly dangerous assembly even without command from a Magistrate (he must, however, contact an Executive Magistrate as soon as possible and then follow his instructions while taking any further actions). The definition of 'unlawful assembly', according to Indian law, is laid down in Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code. According to this section, an assembly of five or more persons becomes unlawful when its purpose is or becomes: # To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the Central or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State, or any public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public servant; # To resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process; # To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence; # By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any person, to take or obtain possession of any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right; # By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do. # # # # Section 146 defines 'rioting' is defined as the offence every member of an unlawful assembly commits, when that assembly or any member of such assembly uses force or violence in pursuit of their common intent. According to Sections 141-149 of the IPC, the maximum punishment for engaging in rioting is rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and/or fine. Every member of an unlawful assembly can be held responsible for a crime committed by the group. Obstructing an officer trying to disperse an unlawful assembly may attract further punishment. In about 1861, Officer Raj-Ratna E.F. Deboo IPS was the designer and architect of section 144, which reduced overall crime in that time in the state of Baroda. He was recognized for his initiative and awarded a gold medal by the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda for putting Section 144 in place and reducing overall crime. Northern Ireland The offence of unlawful assembly in Northern Ireland applies if a person is a member of an assembly of three or more persons which is either causing a disturbance or giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of a breach of the peace. United States In New York State in the United States, a person is guilty of unlawful assembly when he \\"assembles with four or more other persons for the purpose of engaging or preparing to engage with them in tumultuous and violent conduct likely to cause public alarm, or when, being present at an assembly which either has or develops such purpose, he remains there with intent to advance that purpose.\\"  See also  *Curfew *Freedom of assembly Notes References See also: http://law.jrank.org/pages/11014/Unlawful- Assembly.html Category:Crimes Category:Freedom of assembly Category:Criminal Procedure Code Sections ","title":"Unlawful assembly"},{"id":"2163007","text":"Trader may refer to: * Merchant, retailer or one who attempts to generally buy wholesale and sell later at a profit * The owner of a trading post, where manufactured goods were exchanged with native peoples for furs and hides. * Trader (finance), someone who buys and sells financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc. * Trader Classified Media, classified advertisement company * Trader Media East, largest classified advertising company in Central and Eastern Europe * Trader (comics), the name of two separate fictional characters in the Marvel Comics universe * \\"The Trader\\", a song by The Beach Boys from their album Holland * A merchant vessel, a boat or ship that transports cargo or carries passengers for hire.

January 1856) was a French sculptor, medalist and active freemason.Initiated in \\"\\"Le P√®re de famille\\"\\" Lodge in Angers He adopted the name David d'Angers, following his entry into the studio of the painter Jacques-Louis David in 1809 as a way of both expressing his patrimony and distinguishing himself from the master painter. Biography David's Wounded Philopoemen in the Louvre He was born in Angers in 1788. His father was a wood carver and ornamental sculptor, who had joined the volunteer Republican army as a musketeer, fighting against the Chouans of La Vend√©e. He studied in the studio of Jean-Jacques Delusse and in 1808 traveled to Paris to study in the studio of Philippe-Laurent Roland. While in Paris he did work both on the Arc de Triomphe and the exterior of the Louvre. In 1810 he succeeded in taking the second place prize at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts for his Othryades. In 1811 David's La Douleur won the √âcole's competition for t√™te d'expression followed by his taking of the Prix de Rome for his Epaminondas in the same year. He spent five years in Rome, during which time he frequented the studio of Antonio Canova and made small trips around Italy to Venice, Naples and Florence. Returning from Rome around the time of the restoration of the Bourbons and their accompanying foreign conquerors and returned royalists, David d'Angers would not remain in the neighborhood of the Tuileries, opting instead to travel to London. Here John Flaxman and others took him to task for the political sins of David the painter, to whom he was erroneously supposed to be related. With great difficulty he made his way to Paris again, where a comparatively prosperous career opened before him. His medallions and busts were in much request, as well as orders for monumental works. One of the most famous of these was that of Gutenberg at Strassburg; but those he himself valued most were the statue of Barra (Joseph Bara), a drummer boy who purportedly continued to beat his drum until the moment of death in the war in La Vend√©e, and the monument to the Greek liberator Markos Botsaris. Monument to General Gobert (P√®re Lachaise) David's busts and medallions were very numerous, and among his sitters may be found not only the illustrious men and women of France, but many others both of England and Germany countries which he visited professionally in 1827 and 1829. His medallions number over 500. David's fame rests firmly on his pediment of the Pantheon, his marble Wounded Philopoemen in the Louvre and his equestrian monument to General Jacques- Nicolas Gobert in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. In addition to that of Gobert, he did sculptures for seven other tombs at P√®re Lachaise, including the bronze busts of the writer, Honor√© de Balzac and physician Samuel Hahnemann. In the Mus√©e David in Angers is an almost complete collection of his works either in the form of copies or in the original moulds. As an example of his benevolence of character may be mentioned his rushing off to the sickbed of Rouget de Lisle, the author of the Marseillaise Hymn, modelling and carving him in marble without delay, making a lottery of the work, and sending to the poet in the extremity of need the proceeds. Of Reviving Greece, his monument to the Greek liberator Markos Botsaris, showing a Greek child reading his name, Victor Hugo said, \\"It is difficult to see anything more beautiful in the world; this statue joins the grandeur of Pheidias to the expressive manner of Puget.\\"  Museums  * David d'Angers gallery, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Angers * Mus√©e Carnavalet, Paris * Mus√©e de la Vie romantique, Paris Selected works Image:The Greek child of David d'Angers reads the name of Botzaris.jpgReviving Greece, his monument to the Greek liberator Markos Botsaris Image:ArmandDeBricqueville.jpgBust of Armand de Bricqueville, Cherbourg-Octeville Image:Janbart.jpgStatue of Jean Bart in Dunkerque Image:P√®re-Lachaise - Division 48 - Balzac 07.jpgBust of Honor√© de Balzac, cimeti√®re du P√®re-Lachaise Image:Cuvier David d'Angers Louvre RF3957.jpgBust of Georges Cuvier, mus√©e du Louvre Image:Balzac by P J David d Angers 1843.jpgPortrait of Honor√© de Balzac Image:David_de_Pury_Neuchatel.jpgStatue of David de Pury Image:Xavier Bichat par David D'Anger.jpgStatue de Xavier Bichat, Paris Descartes University Image:Gutenberg (Paris - 15 eme).jpgStatue of Gutenberg, Imprimerie nationale, Paris File:PL David d'Angers.jpgTomb of David d'Angers - P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Image:Angers - Abbaye Toussaint (1).jpgThe Mus√©e David d'Angers, in the former Toussaint Abbey, Angers Notes References ;Attribution * See also * Pierre-Jean David d'Angers (French Wikipedia) External links * Category:1788 births Category:1856 deaths Category:People from Angers Category:Politicians from Pays de la Loire Category:French republicans Category:Members of the 1848 Constituent Assembly Category:19th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors Category:French Freemasons Category:Prix de Rome for sculpture Category:Members of the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:Artists of the Boston Public Library Category:19th- century male artists ","title":"David d'Angers"},{"id":"2163039","text":"George Henry Burns (January 31, 1893 ‚Äì January 7, 1978), nicknamed \\"Tioga George\\", was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for five American League (AL) teams from 1914 to 1929. One of the league's top right-handed batters of the 1920s, he was named the AL Most Valuable Player in 1926 with the Cleveland Indians after batting .358 and setting a major league record with 64 doubles. A career .307 hitter, he retired with 2,018 hits, then the third-highest total by an AL right-handed hitter. His 1,671 games at first base were the most by an AL right-handed player until 1940; he still ranks third in league history. Career Born in Niles, Ohio, Burns was a line drive hitter and a solid defensive first baseman who hit .300 or better in all but one of his full seasons between 1918 and 1927. After four unremarkable seasons with the Detroit Tigers (1914‚Äì17), he was acquired by the Philadelphia Athletics in 1918. In his first season with the team he hit .352, surpassed only by the .382 of Detroit's Ty Cobb, and led the AL in hits (178) and total bases (236) while also setting a league record with 109 double plays at first base (Earl Sheely surpassed the mark three years later). After slipping to .296 in 1919, he was sent to the Indians in May 1920. During the 1920 regular season, Burns was stuck behind regular first baseman Doc Johnston; but his play revived in the World Series, in which he and Johnston were platooned by manager Tris Speaker. Burns started Game 6, and with the Indians up 3‚Äì2 in the Series and no score in the sixth inning, Burns doubled home Speaker with the only run of the game as the Indians edged the Brooklyn Dodgers 1‚Äì0 to take a 4‚Äì2 lead in the nine-game series. Cleveland won again the next day, capturing the first Series title for the franchise. During the season, after shortstop Ray Chapman died one day after being hit by a pitch, Burns had welcomed newly acquired Joe Sewell by giving him one of his own bats; Sewell went on to use the same bat, which he called \\"Black Betsy\\", throughout a 14-year career in which he struck out only 114 times. After the 1921 season, in which he and Johnston again competed for playing time, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox, and batted .306 and .328 in 1922 and 1923, finishing second in the league in doubles the latter year. He got the first hit ever in Yankee Stadium in 1923, and on September 14 of that year against the Indians, Burns turned an unassisted triple play ‚Äì only the fourth in major league history, and the first by a first baseman. In the second inning, he caught Frank Brower's line drive, tagged Walt Lutzke off first base and actually ran to second base, sliding in before Riggs Stephenson could return from third. The following January, he was traded back to the Indians ‚Äì notably, in a deal which involved Bill Wambsganss, who had turned the only unassisted triple play in World Series history as Burns' teammate in 1920. Back with Cleveland, Burns hit over .300 in each of the next four seasons and was regularly among the league leaders in doubles. In 1926 he broke Speaker's 1923 major league mark of 59 doubles; his record was broken in 1931 by Earl Webb, though Burns still retains a share of the mark for right-handed hitters, along with Joe Medwick. Burns also led the league in hits (216) for the second time, and was second in the league in runs batted in (RBIs), behind Babe Ruth. For his accomplishments that year he was named the MVP, becoming the first Cleveland player to be so honored, and in May 1927 he was presented with an automobile and a silver bat containing $1,150 during a day honoring him. In 1928 he broke Stuffy McInnis's AL record of 1,608 games at first base, though Joe Judge passed him later that year; his AL mark for right-handed players was broken in 1940 by Jimmie Foxx, and he still trails only Foxx and George Scott in league history. After being sent to the New York Yankees in late 1928, Burns appeared in only 13 games for the team before rejoining the Athletics in 1929. He ended his career with an unusual pinch-hitting appearance in the 1929 World Series, in which he won his second championship. In the fourth game, he was sent in to bat for the pitcher with the Athletics down 8‚Äì3, and was retired twice in a 10-run inning that resulted in a victory. In his 16-season career, Burns hit 72 home runs with 954 RBIs in 1866 games played. With 2,018 hits, he then trailed only Nap Lajoie (2,523) and Harry Heilmann (2,499) in AL history among right-handed hitters; his 444 career doubles ranked eighth in major league history among right-handers, and fifth among all AL players. With 110 times being hit by a pitch, he ranked second in the AL to Kid Elberfeld. Following his major league career he played for five seasons in the Pacific Coast League, leading the league in RBIs in 1932, and managed in the minors until 1939. He left baseball to become a deputy sheriff in the Seattle area (King County) until his retirement in 1967. Burns died in early 1978 at Evergreen Hospital in Kirkland at age 84, and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Seattle.

It is considered the cardinal religious mosque in the country, where a million people offer Eid prayers twice a year. It is located near the Mahmud Khan bridge and National Stadium in the eastern part of the city, in the Shar-e-barq of Kabul, which is one of the wealthier areas of the city. The \\"Id Gah\\" or \\"Eid Gah\\" refers to an open space where people congregate during national and religious celebrations. The open grounds of Id Gah are also used as a parking lot for trucks that transport goods to and from Peshawar. In most references Babur, a Muslim warrior at the time had just invaded and devastated India and ordered a Mosque be built to glorify Islam, he had his warriors bring back precious stone from the Punjab, Sindh and surrounding areas and had Persian architects build a structure for his Kabul subjects. It has been the scene of religious festivals, religious ceremonies, state functions such as coronations and priestly religious ceremonies attended by Kings and Amirs. It was from this mosque that the then Amir Habibullah made his historic announcement of his country's independence, in 1919. The Id Gah Mosque was stated to be a target of attack when two suspects were arrested on February 10, 2006 with their vehicle found loaded with 8 kg of explosives. History Interior of the mosque. The dramatic series of arches internally along its considerable length can be seen. Id Gah Mosque was commissioned by Babur the ruler of the Mughal empire before being renovated on a large scale by King Abdur Rahman Khan in 1893 or before. Another story relates to Jahangir being the original builder of this mosque, using local quarries and materials as Kabul was a key mughal city works of art were often commissioned here. Afghan history records indicate that in 1901, the then Emir of Afghanistan, the head of the state, publicly performed the priestly functions by celebrating the Id at Id Gah Mosque. The chief priest of Kabul immediately proclaimed Habibullah to be the successor of Mohamed, whereupon the Emir of Afghanistan delivered an address inspired by an \\"intolerant ecclesiasticism\\". Among other things the Amir passed a dictum that a fine of up to ten Kabuli Rupees would be levied on all who did not offer prayers in the mosques. A register of the daily attendance of all individuals was to be kept in various places and a ‚Äúbox of justice‚Äù was to be kept into which secret reports could be dropped reporting on people who had not obeyed this dictum of compulsory attendance for religious prayers at the mosques. In 1914‚Äì15, the bitter feud between Britain and Afghanistan assumed the proportions of a holy war or jihad, even though the new ruler Emir Habibullah had initially opposed this approach of the mullahs. After his ascension to the throne in 1919, he aligned with the mullahs to attack British bases. Before he launched a war on May 15, 1919, the Emir made a speech at the Id Gah Mosque in Kabul urging his countrymen to wage jihad against the British. After the Third Anglo-Afghan War, on August 19, 1919, Emir Amanullah announced Afghanistan's independence from this mosque. On September 21, 2010 a demonstration took place at the mosque. Architecture Id Gah Mosque is located in an affluent part of Kabul and reflects the rich Muslim architecture and heritage. It attracts pilgrims from far-afield to visit this holy place. The mosque is painted in beige and white and has four minarets at the front, two flanking the higher central arch and then one either side of the arched sections on either side of the central arch. There are in turn four minarets assembled in the same fashion on the other side and a single smaller minaret of a different color in the centre of the roof. The mosque is a very long building and narrow in width. Excluding the prominent central beige painted area of 3 archways, the mosque has 18 dark archways either side along its length. The courtyard area, known as Eid Gah Square, is vast and is capable of holding massive populations of Muslims who attend the mosque during the prayer season.

The oldest Muslim political party in Afghanistan, it was originally formed as a student political society at Kabul University. The majority of the party are ethnic Tajiks of northern and western Afghanistan. It has a communitarian ideology based on Islamic law. During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War and the following Afghan Civil War against the communist government, Jamiat-e Islami was one of the most powerful of the mujahideen groups. Burhanuddin Rabbani led the party (including its predecessors) from 1968 to 2011, and served as President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan from 1992 to 2001 (in exile from 1996).mirror History = Early years = Jamiat \\"emerged\\" in 1972 from among \\"the informal Islamist groupings that had existed since the 1960s\\". Led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, a professor of Islamic theology at Kabul University, it was inspired by Abul A'la Maududi and his Jamaat-e- Islami Pakistan. When Rabbani's arrest was ordered by Mohammad Daoud Khan in 1973, it was to Pakistan that Rabbani fled, and Jamaat-e-Islami who initially hosted him there. (Later Jamait lost the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami to the more purist Hezb-i Islami.) In Pakistan, Professor Rabbani gathered important people and continued to build the party. Sayed Noorullah Emad, who was then a young Muslim at Kabul University became its general secretary and, later, its deputy chief. Some of its prominent commanders included Ustad Zabihullah, Ahmad Shah Massoud, Ismail Khan, Atta Muhammad Nur, Mullah Naqib and Dr. Fazlullah. Ahmad Shah Massoud directed the military wing of the party. = Massoud‚ÄìHekmatyar split = Ahmad Shah Massoud and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar were both early followers of Rabbani, being Kabul University students at the time. Hekmatyar broke away from Jamiat in 1976 to found his own party: Hezb-e Islami. The two groups formed the two main tendencies of the Islamist movement in Afghanistan, and after the April 1978 coup and the brutality of the invading Soviet Army, the two strongest Afghan mujahideen groups in the 1980s.  Jamiat  Rabbani and the Jamiat advocated \\"building of a widely based movement that would create popular support\\", a gradualist strategy of infiltration of society and the state apparatus to gain power. Jamiat was dominated by Tajiks but had a greater \`tribal and regional cross section\` than other groups, and was willing to seek \\"common ground\\" with non-Islamists. It gained prominence because of the battlefield success of Ahmad Shah Massoud.  Hezb-i Islami  Hezb-i Islami was overwhelmingly Ghilzai Pashtun, and backed by Pakistan president Zia ul-Haq. Its leader, Hekmatyar, was \\"implacably hostile to any form of compromise\\" favouring violent armed conflict. As a result, Hezb-i Islami, and not Jamiat, gained the support of the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, and Saudi Arabian networks. = Soviet invasion = After the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan in 1979, Massoud organised a mujahideen group in Parwan Province to fight against the Communist government and their Soviet allies. This group grew to control multiple provinces and include thousands of fighters. The Soviet Army launched a series of major offensives to attempt to destroy their forces, but they were unable to engage most of Massoud's men. = Battles between Jamiat and Hezb-i Islami = After the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in 1989, the mujahideen groups continued to wear down government forces. However they also fought among each other: in June 1990, battles between Jamiat and Gulbuddin's Hezb in Logar and Parwan caused hundreds of casualties on each side. = 1992‚Äì2001 = In 1992 the communist government collapsed entirely. Jamiat's forces were among the first to enter Kabul. Meanwhile, a peace and power-sharing agreement among the leadership of the Afghan political party leaders led to a tentative agreement to appoint Burhanuddin Rabbani, who had spent the civil war in exile, as interim president. The peace agreement was called the Peshawar Accords. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar however, did not support the peace agreement despite the fact that he was repeatedly offered the position of prime minister. Subsequently his Hezb-i Islami attacked the new interim government and the capital of Kabul with tens of thousands of rockets. As Hezb-i Wahdat and Ittihad-i Islami started a second war in 1992 and Dostum's Junbish-i Milli joined Hekmatyar in 1994, Kabul witnessed a gruesome war with massive civilian casualties and destruction of much of the city. In 1995 the Islamic State of Afghanistan government also with Jamiat forces retained control of Kabul, pushing back a coalition of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami, the Hizb-i-Wahdat and Abdul Rashid Dostum's Jumbish-i-Milli Islami. By 1995, the Taliban, which had seized control of much of southern Afghanistan with comparative ease the previous year, were advancing on Kabul. Jamiat rejected Taliban demands that they surrender, and the Taliban rejected Jamiat's offer to join a peaceful political process leading towards a general election. In March 1995, Massoud handed the Taliban their first major loss, however, with the aid of Saudi and Pakistani backing, they regrouped and launched and offensive in mid-1996. Massoud ordered the retreat of his troops among them Jamiat to avoid another bloodbath. Following the capture of Kabul by the Taliban, the major mujahideen factions put aside their feuds and formed the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (the United Front), commonly known in the west as the Northern Alliance, with Rabbani, officially becoming its political leader. Other Jamiat members took up senior positions within the United Front government: Yunus Qanuni served as Interior Minister and Dr. Abdullah became Foreign Minister, for example. On 9 September 2001, just two days before the September 11 attacks in the United States, Massoud was assassinated by two suicide bombers, probably at the instigation of al-Qaeda. Immediately afterwards Taliban forces launched a major offensive against United Front positions. Mohammed Qasim Fahim was chosen to succeed Massoud as leader of Jamiat's military wing and repulsed the Taliban offensive. With extensive assistance from an American-led coalition in October and November 2001 (see War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent)), United Front forces recaptured most of Afghanistan. Jamiat's founder and leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani, was assassinated in 2011.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8776911/Former- Afghanistan-president-Burhanuddin-Rabbani-killed-in-Kabul-blast.html His son, Salahuddin Rabbani, has since led the party.

The film was directed by James Parrott. Laurel and Hardy play dual roles as their own children. It also inspired a helper group for the Michigan tent for The Sons of the Desert, which is composed of all the child members of the tent. This is the first of only three films where the boys each play a dual role: the second is Twice Two and the third and last is Our Relations. Plot Laurel and Hardy are spending a night in with the kids. The fathers are playing checkers and pool, but are constantly distracted by their own incompetence and by their children, who are constantly bullying each other and trying to stay up late. The film begins with Stan and Ollie playing a game of checkers, and Stan Jr. and Ollie Jr. playing with blocks. They smash a vase and are sent to bed. Ollie Jr. is pushed into a full bath and chases Stan Jr. out (leaving the taps and the shower on), but slips on the soap causing part of the ceiling to crash onto the pool table. Stan and Ollie are furious and rush upstairs, only to find their junior versions in bed pretending to be asleep. When both boys ask for a drink of water, Oliver opens the door to the by-now flooded bathroom, and the water gushes out from the bathroom in a torrent, bowling them over in a drenched heap as the film ends. Cast * Stan Laurel * Oliver Hardy Production Brats was one of four Laurel and Hardy sound shorts reissued in 1937. At that time, new background music scores by Leroy Shield that were used in many 1937 Hal Roach films were added. The films reissued that way were Blotto, County Hospital and Perfect Day. Additionally, Brats' introductory title (\\"Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy remained at home to take care of the children---\\"/\\"Their wives had gone out for target practice--\\") was eliminated from the reissue prints. This is one of just two shorts to feature only Stan and Ollie in the cast; the other is the 1928 silent Early to Bed. It is also the only film in which they play natural fathers. The illusion of Laurel and Hardy as children was achieved using oversized furniture. Each room of the house was re-created in large scale to achieve the effect of both duos being in the same house. Doors and staircases had to be duplicated to appear as though the \\"children\\" were child-size. The \\"children\\" are as tall as a doorknob and a sink and Stan Jr must use a stepstool to reach the tub's taps, the tub seeming more like a small pool. Ollie Jr's bulk causes him to crash through some dresser drawers. The mouse that Stan Jr. nearly shoots with a pellet gun was animated.

History =Origins: St Winifred‚Äôs Schools for Girls (1907‚Äì1941)= =Rebirth: Redhill School (1941‚Äì1949)= In 1941, Catherine Hill became the Headmistress with a bold vision to completely transform and revitalise the school's image, both physically and in the name. ‚ÄúSt Winifred‚Äôs School for Girls‚Äù became ‚ÄúRedhill School‚Äù, named for the Headmistress and the vibrant colour of the new uniforms. It was here that the ‚ÄúRedhill Family‚Äù with the new ‚ÄúFree to Build‚Äù motto, was born. The ‚Äònew‚Äô school had a total of 68 pupils, 34 in each of the junior and high schools, later rising to 129 with the support of Director, Mr L Guittard, staff, parents and pupils. Towards the end of 1941, when many young mothers went to work during the war effort, Redhill opened a Nursery School, which was soon to become the first independent nursery school that was up to government standards in those days. As a result of financial difficulties, Catherine Hill sought out more affordable premises for the school, finally settling on a group of rondavels in Morningside. To raise funds, Redhill School was registered as a company on 6 April 1946, and it was at this time that many parents agreed to serve on the board of directors. =Dorothy Thompson at the Helm (1949‚Äì1968)= Amidst crippling financial troubles, Catherine Hill (who had remarried to become Catherine Rodda) handed over the reins of leadership to Deputy Principal, Dorothy Thompson. Despite these difficulties, this was also a time of optimism for the school as pupil numbers continued to increase and educational standards improved vastly. Elements of the curriculum could be seen as almost revolutionary, given the times and the conservative nature of education under the National Party. Despite the restricted quota system on pupils of colour, to qualify for a government grant, the school was not prepared to impose this quota and claimed to be an ‚Äúundenominational school‚Ä¶ that endeavours to build religious tolerance and mutual respect among individuals and groups with differing points of view‚Äù. =The Damelin Years (1968‚Äì1979)= As financial difficulties continued, the governors approached Dr Isaac Kriel, the principal and majority shareholder of the Damelin Group, to take over the ownership and management of the school, and in 1968, Redhill School officially came under the guidance of the Damelin Group in a widely publicised deal worth R300 000. From that point, Redhill underwent fundamental changes under the leadership of these dedicated educationists. From a girls‚Äô school of 150 pupils, the numbers would increase over the next ten years to 630, including boys. Major progress would be made towards achieving academic excellence through a more traditional and rigorous approach to education. Dr Kriel and Mr Witt brought some excellent new teachers to Redhill from Damelin. Change was constant at Redhill during this time, and while stricter, more formal policies were put into place, many of the core values would remain deeply entrenched. In 1969, Margaret Landers became the new Headmistress and brought with her some much- needed stability to the changing school dynamic with a stricter and more formal approach to education. During this time, Dr Kriel and Mr Witt recognised that co-education was ‚Äúin keeping with modern educational principles, and enjoyed worldwide acceptance‚Äù, and so in 1974, the first boys entered the Primary School. In January 1975, the school year opened under the leadership of William Harrison, who was the first Headmaster in the school's history. =Towards a Progressive Ideal (1979‚Äì1989)= Following a decision by Dr Kriel and Mr Witt to depart from Redhill, the school came under the care of a Trust, which was registered in July 1979, and a Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of Mr PB Oertel came into being. During this time, continuity in leadership created problems for the school until Jeremy Barnes was appointed as Headmaster in 1984 and the school came under the control of a truly dedicated and forward-thinking educationist. Roger Briggs was appointed in 1983 as the Principal of the Preparatory School and Jenny Stead took on the leadership of the nursery school. This core of dedicated leaders was well placed to take Redhill through the next decade of change. During the course of the 1980s, a number of black students were admitted into Redhill and a scholarship scheme was established to provide scholarships for them despite laws restricting black children from attending what was considered by the government as a ‚Äòwhites only‚Äô school. Another crucial cornerstone of Redhill's progressive educational philosophy was the notion of religious tolerance. =‚ÄúFree to Build‚Äù: Modernising the Campus (1991‚Äì2003)= After the departure of Roger Briggs and Jeremy Barnes, Ben Brooks was appointed as the new Headmaster, with Brian Mitchell taking over as the Principal of the Preparatory school, inheriting Redhill at a time when the country was about to enter the most significant period of change in its history. As a result of a period of sustained stability, over the next decade, the school would be significantly remodelled in the most extensive and sustained building programme in its history. One of the key decisions made under Ben Brooks was to replace the state exam with the new IEB exam. Architecture The park like campus is dominated by red-brick buildings with green corrugated iron roofing. The oldest buildings on the campus are a set of thatched rondavels in a typical African style.

He has also worked in ESPN in Singapore, and hosts a wide variety of Cantonese sports programmes, including football, basketball, baseball, American football, tennis and boxing. He is famous for his odd catchphrases during programmes, such as: :There are only two possibilities for penalty: it's either going to go in or not. :Who're the best friends of goalkeepers in the match? Of course the posts and the bars are :Which team scores first in this match has a greater chance to win the match. :Gary Neville has 3 weaknesses: no pace, running slow, not fast enough. :This match can be put in the fridge now. (meaning the result is unlikely to change) Such catchphrases are often use by other Cantonese-speaking sports commentators. He is a very controversial football commentator in Hong Kong, many find his commentating style being senseless but he has also many supporters thinking he is very entertaining. His catchphrases and quotes in his shows has once been quoted in an email on the internet, named \\"101 golden football quotes of Peter Wong\\", which was then widely circulated. He also teaches English, Spanish, French and Italian languages during a football match to Hong Kong audiences. His best partner is Simon Kong (Ê±üÂø†Âæ∑), who said they have co-operated for 15 years in a UEFA Champions League commentary. Wong also writes football gambling tips in famous Hong Kong newspapers, and he is noted for the low accuracy rate of his predictions. It has been recorded that Wong had 23 failures out of 33 predictions about consecutive matches.http://hk.sports.yahoo.com/050416/42/1bnje.htm In internet forums like HKGolden, he is glorified and nicknamed as Kwai Sun (Kwai God, Ê°ÇÁ•û) for being so reliable that gamblers can nearly always win by going against his predictions. Peter Wong is a Liverpool fan, as he wrote in one famous sentence: I tip Liverpool in feelings, but I tip AC Milan in sense, in a newspaper before the final of the 2005 UEFA Champions League. In addition, it can be obviously seen that Peter Wong is so excited during the commentary of Liverpool matches. Peter Wong has a wide interpersonal connection, he has a lot of celebrity friends as he mentioned in his programmes. And he often said that the legendary English football commentator, Martin Tyler is one of his mentors. Peter Wong is also very interested in singing Louis Koo's songs. His personal favourite is ÂÉèÊàëÈÄô‰∏ÄÁ®ÆÁî∑‰∫∫. It was discovered that when he sings this song, he could not put down the microphone. Despite his entertaining performance during programmes, Peter Wong had a sad life. His father, a Hong Kong tycoon, was kidnapped and killed in 1959. The kidnap case was known as the Three Wolves Case (‰∏âÁãºÊ°à) and is considered one of the most famous crime in the Hong Kong history. His wife also died in a plane crash while travelling alone in the United States in 1982. He was the former coach of Eastern AA, South China AA and Tsuen Wan. In the 1982-83 season, South China AA, under Peter Wong, was relegated to second division, the first time in the club's history, and finally retained due to request of Hong Kong Football Association. He is described as a commentator, who integrates Latin and English styles of football commentary, together with Hong Kong local color.

He only produced two etchings, one of which dates from 1513 ‚Äì the earliest known etching for which a date has been established. However, his woodcuts are considered of greater significance, particularly as he is attributed with the invention of the white-line woodcut technique, where white lines create the image on a black background. He also produced a few engravings, including copies of works by Martin Schongauer and Albrecht D√ºrer.Arthur M. Hind. A History of Engraving and Etching. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1923 (in US), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. He produced innovative drawings intended as finished works of art rather than just studies. Biography Graf learned goldsmithing first from his father, Hugo Graf, then from a goldsmith in Z√ºrich. He continued to work as a goldsmith and a few pieces survive. He initially earned money as a designer of woodcut book illustrations and by assisting a stained glass painter. In 1512, he bought citizenship in Basel and became a member of the goldsmiths' guild. He quickly came into conflict with the law for abusing his wife and consorting with prostitutes, culminating in accusations of attempted murder which caused him to flee the city in 1518. He was allowed to return to Basel the following year, where he continued working, but after 1527 his life becomes unclear. Given his frequent employment as a soldier of fortune it is possible he was present at the sack of Rome.P. Murray & L. Murray, 'The Penguin Dictionary of Art & Artists' (p.198 section G) Harmondsworth, 1959 (1982 revision) Christiane Andersson noted that, \\"When and where he died are unknown: his wife remarried in October 1528 but an autograph drawing is dated 1529\\".Andersson Like many Swiss men of his day, Graf was known to have worked as a mercenary for considerable periods. His artistic output, arising from the tradition of Albrecht D√ºrer and Hans Baldung, includes a wide range of subjects, depicting social, erotic, military, political, and criminal images (e.g., Two Prostitutes Beating a Monk), as well as strong religious feelings which emerge in some works.

Wyndham's Theatre in London is named after him, and he also built the New Theatre (now the No√´l Coward Theatre) nearby. Wyndham's family intended him for a medical career, and he studied medicine while enthusiastically engaging in amateur theatricals in his spare time. Torn between medicine and the stage, he spent three years in the US as a surgeon in the Union army in the American Civil War and on two occasions acted unsuccessfully on the New York stage. After returning to Britain and establishing himself as an actor he made further trips to the US between 1882 and 1910, playing in theatres all around the country. In London, Wyndham became known for his comic skills, both in light comedy and farce. He took over the management of the Criterion Theatre in 1876 and remained in charge there for more than 20 years. \\"Criterion farce\\" became a familiar feature of the West End theatre, usually risqu√© French pieces toned down to avoid shocking the Victorian British audience. Later, Wyndham was known for his appearances in period costume dramas, most of all T. W. Robertson's David Garrick, which he revived frequently. Among the authors who wrote for him were W. S. Gilbert, F. C. Burnand and Henry Arthur Jones. Oscar Wilde wrote The Importance of Being Earnest with Wyndham in mind, but circumstances prevented him from playing in it. Wyndham commissioned two London theatres, both designed by W. G. R. Sprague: Wyndham's, opened in 1899, and the New, which opened four years later. He retired in 1913, and died at his London house in 1919, aged 81. Life and career =Early years= Wyndham as a teenager Wyndham was born in Liverpool on 23 March 1837, the second son of Major Richard Culverwell (c. 1820‚Äì1860) and his wife, Mary Ann. He had one brother, who did not survive childhood, and three sisters. Biographies published in Wyndham's lifetime state that Culverwell was a doctor,Pemberton, p. 1Shore, p. 1 but in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2011) Michael Read writes: Wyndham went to boarding-schools in England, Scotland, Germany and France. In Scotland he acquired the taste for amateur theatricals, and in Paris he frequented the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal. The former was known for its classical style and the latter had a long tradition of farce; both were a formative influence on his acting. He studied medicine at King's College, London, and at the College of Surgeons and the Peter Street Anatomical School in Dublin, and despite the counter-attractions of amateur acting and theatre-going he qualified as MRCS in 1857 and took his Doctor of Medicine degree at the University of Giessen in 1859. In 1860 he married Emma Silberrad (c. 1837‚Äì1916), a member of a German family that was both aristocratic and affluent. Read comments, \\"By marrying into this house of merchant princes Wyndham was spared the fear of destitution that plagued other actors\\". In February 1862 Wyndham, who had by then adopted his stage surname, made his professional debut at the Royalty Theatre as the juvenile lead opposite the young, but already experienced, Ellen Terry. Her acting was praised; his was not.\\"Public Amusements\\", Lloyd's Illustrated Newspaper, 9 February 1862, p. 8; and \\"The Theatrical and Musical Examiner\\", The Examiner, 15 February 1862, p. 9 At the time, it was the practice of some London theatre managers to engage amateurs to appear in prominent roles in otherwise professional companies, and The Examiner took Wyndham for such an amateur.\\"The Theatrical and Musical Examiner\\", The Examiner, 15 February 1862, p. 9 He remained in the Royalty's company for six months, and after his inauspicious debut he began to attract excellent reviews. In the farce Grandfather Whitehead he won praise from the theatrical newspaper The Era, which found him \\"a very promising Light Comedian\\" and his playing \\"as easy, natural and perfect as it need be\\".\\"The Theatres\\", The Era, 2 March 1862, p. 11 In a later review during the season The Era said: As a military surgeon in the American Civil War Still undecided between a theatrical and medical career, but too adventurous in spirit to relish the idea of becoming a family doctor,Pemberton, p. 7 Wyndham travelled to the US later in 1862, determined to become a medical officer in the Union army in the American Civil War. The military authorities hesitated to sign him up, but he successfully persisted and served until the war was nearly over.\\"Death of Sir Charles Wyndham\\", The Times, 13 January 1919, p. 11 During breaks from his military service he made two unsuccessful appearances on the stage in New York, first in a company led by John Wilkes Booth (later the assassin of Abraham Lincoln),Child, H.

Retrieved 16 August 2020 and then in Mrs John Wood's troupe.Pemberton, pp. 26‚Äì28 =Professional advance, 1865‚Äì1873= In 1865 Wyndham returned to England. He resumed his British stage career in a leading role in a play he had written, My Lady's Guardian, which opened at the Theatre Royal, Manchester in July. The local correspondent of The Era was moderately complimentary about the play and said that Wyndham \\"possesses innate talent as a light comedian\\".\\"Provincial Theatricals\\", The Era, 9 July 1865, p. 12 When Wyndham took the production to Liverpool the same paper described him as \\"one of the most accomplished actors we have seen for a long time\\".\\"Mr. Charles Wyndham in Her Ladyship's Guardian\\", The Era, 6 August 1865, p. 10 His success in this and other provincial productions enabled him to gain a West End engagement the following year.Pemberton, p. 35 Wyndham joined the company of the Royalty in May 1866 under the management of Patty Oliver. He played Sir Arthur Lascelles in Maddison Morton's well-known play, All That Glitters Is Not Gold, given as a supporting piece to a new extravaganza.Pemberton, p. 36 Of his later roles during the season, the most prominent was as the smuggler, Hatchett, in F. C. Burnand's new and immensely popular burlesque on Douglas Jerrold's nautical comedy, Black-Eyed Susan, with Oliver and Nelly Bromley. Burnand was impressed by Wyndham ‚Äì his dancing as much as his acting.Burnand, p. 302 Everard, Wyndham, Dyas, John Clayton and Hodson; and sitting: Toole, Brough and Irvingalt=Stage photograph showing group of 3 women and five men in everyday Victorian clothes In 1867 Wyndham joined the company at the St James's Theatre, where he acted with Henry Irving for the first time. In September and October of the same year he appeared at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester, in Kate Terry's farewell season, in which his roles included Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Claudio in Much Ado About Nothing, the clown Modus in James Sheridan Knowles's The Hunchback, and Laertes in Hamlet.Parker, Gaye et al, pp. 2638‚Äì2641 Before returning to the West End, he went to his home town, Liverpool, to create the role of Roberto in W.S.Gilbert's extravaganza La Vivandi√®re. The Liverpool Mercury said, \\"In acting, singing and dancing he fairly carried the audience with him\\".\\"The new burlesque company at St James's Hall\\", The Liverpool Mercury, 17 June 1867, p. 5 Returning to London, Wyndham was then engaged for the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, and there in October and November 1867 ‚Äì as the gallant Dujardin in The Double Marriage and the seducer Hawksley in Still Waters Run Deep ‚Äì he once again partnered Ellen Terry. The company at the Queen's also included Irving, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, Henrietta Hodson, Harriett Everard and Ada Dyas, who all appeared with Wyndham in January 1868 in H. J. Byron's Dearer Than Life, given in a double bill with the London production of La Vivandi√®re, in which Wyndham's former role was played by Brough. \\"La Vivandi√®re\\", Pall Mall Gazette. 28 January 1868, p. 11 In 1868 Wyndham made his first venture into management, when he took the Princess's Theatre, presenting a season of three plays, but the undertaking was not successful. He returned to the US and appeared at Wallack's Theatre in 1869, playing Charles Surface in The School for Scandal, a role he made particularly his own. After several more New York productions, and having established a reputation as a light comedian, he started an American touring company of his own, opening with The Lancers in Washington DC in March 1871. He continued to tour all over the US until 1873, with a repertory of 20 plays, mostly comedies. =Farce and the Criterion, 1873‚Äì1881= The Pink Dominos, 1877 Wyndham returned to England in 1873 and appeared for various managements including the Bancrofts, in new plays and revivals of classics (as Jack Rover in Wild Oats and Charles Surface again). At the Court Theatre in May 1874, he played Bob Sackett in a new farce, Brighton; Who's Who in the Theatre records, \\"his success in that play was very great, and the play remained a trump card In his repertory for many years\\". The Times later described the play as \\"the founder of his fortunes, [which] set him off upon a theatrical course in which he was unrivalled\\". In September 1874 Wyndham inaugurated a series of matin√©es at the Crystal Palace in which, over three years, he presented nearly a hundred plays, and acted in many of them, in roles including Bassanio in The Merchant of Venice, and Mephistopheles in Faust and Marguerite; he staged but did not appear in Sophocles' Antigone and Oedipus at Colonus. Wyndham made his first appearance at the Criterion Theatre, in December 1875 in Brighton, and the following year he took over the management of that theatre, which he retained for more than 20 years. The Times described the Criterion under Wyndham as \\"the home of farce and Wyndham its unequalled performer and stage manager\\". Many of the plays he presented were adaptations from the French, in which the precision and speed of the Palais-Royal productions of his youth were a considerable influence on his staging. Some Palais-Royal material required judicious modification for a respectable English audience of the 1870s, but The Times said, \\"His grace and vivacity were enchanting, and his lightness of touch relieved liveliness of offence\\". Read writes: Wyndham did not always play in his own productions; he starred in James Albery's The Pink Dominos (1877, 555 performances) but did not appear in Burnand's Betsy (1879, 408 performances).Gaye, pp. 1528 and 1536 A rare failure was Gilbert's farce Foggerty's Fairy (1881), in which Wyndham appeared with his former employer, Mrs John Wood; it opened on 15 December and closed on 6 January.\\"Criterion Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 16 December 1881, p. 3; and \\"Notices\\", The Times, 6 January 1882, p. 6, and 7 January 1882, p. 8 =Costume drama, 1882‚Äì1899= Mary Moore, in She Stoops to Conquer, 1890alt=young white woman, sitting, older white man standing, both in 18th-century costume In 1882 Wyndham again visited the United States, where he remained for eighteen months. His Criterion company was the first English troupe to reach America's west coast. On his return to London he successfully continued with modern-dress farce for some years, before turning to period pieces, first in a revival of Wild Oats in May 1886, and later in the same year in T. W. Robertson's David Garrick, a piece with which he became closely associated, playing the title role hundreds of times, including a production in German (in his own translation) which he toured in Europe in 1888, appearing in St Petersburg before Tsar Alexander III and his court. David Garrick remained Wyndham's principal period-costume role, but he presented several more over the next decade, including Dion Boucicault's London Assurance (as Dazzle, 1890), and 18th-century comedies by Goldsmith, Sheridan, and O'Keeffe. Despite his considerable success in these plays, Read writes that many thought his finest achievement of all was \\"the portrayal of mellow, titled men of the world, cynical but tender\\", in plays written for him by Henry Arthur Jones: Lord Clivebrook in The Bauble Shop (1893), Sir Richard Kato QC in The Case of Rebellious Susan (1894), Dr Carey in The Physician (1897), Colonel Sir Christopher Deering in The Liars (1897) and Sir Daniel Carteret in Mrs Dane's Defence (1900). Wyndham missed the chance to create one of Oscar Wilde's leading roles. Wilde modelled John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earnest on Wyndham's stage persona, and Wyndham accepted the play for production. Before it could be put into rehearsal, his fellow actor-manager George Alexander had a sudden crisis when a production failed and he had no play with which to follow it. At Wilde's request, Wyndham released the rights, and Alexander staged The Importance in February 1895. Wilde promised his next play to Wyndham, but that did not materialise, as later in 1895 Wilde was disgraced and imprisoned, and his career came to an end.Wilde, pp. 418‚Äì419Edwards, Owen Dudley. \\"Wilde, Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills (1854‚Äì1900), writer\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 August 2020 In 1897 Wyndham separated from his wife. His partner for the rest of his life was the actress Mary Moore, widow of James Albery; she had become Wyndham's leading lady, in 1885, and his business partner in 1896. In November 1899 Wyndham opened a new theatre, to which he gave his name, in Charing Cross Road. Wyndham's Theatre, designed by W. G. R. Sprague, had a deeper and wider stage than the Criterion, and the auditorium had a 20 per cent larger capacity.\\"Wyndham's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 16 November 1899, p. 6 Wyndham opened his new theatre with a revival of David Garrick, donating the first night's takings of ¬£4,000 to charity. =Later years, 1900‚Äì1919= In April 1900 Wyndham played the title role in Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac. Read suggests that lack of early experience in provincial repertory had left Wyndham technically struggling with a part so different from his usual roles, but the reviews were friendly,\\"Mr. Wyndham in Cyrano De Bergerac\\", London Evening Standard, 20 April 1900, p. 5;\\"The Week at the Play\\", The Outlook, 28 Apr 1900, pp. 406-406; and \\"Cyrano de Bergerac at Wyndham's Theatre\\", Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 2 June 1900, p. 5 and it was the play that did not attract audiences. He reverted to his recognised speciality, modern-dress comedy. Wyndham's grave in Hampstead Cemetery In the 1902 Coronation Honours Wyndham was knighted.\\"The Coronation Honours\\", The Times, 26 June 1902. p. 5 In 1903 he opened another theatre, the New (later called the Albery, and since 2006 the No√´l Coward Theatre), in St Martin's Lane, backing onto Wyndham's. In the same year, he and his company appeared before Edward VII and his court at Windsor Castle, in David Garrick; in a second command performance at Windsor, in 1907, Wyndham played John Mildmay in Taylor's Still Waters Run Deep, in which he had first played (in another role) at the Queen's forty years earlier. He continued to act in the US, appearing there in 1904, 1909, and 1910. His memory began to fail, and in 1913 he retired, after a final run of David Garrick.

Zlatko Gall is known as an advocate for rock music as an expression of urban culture and liberal values. He sees rock music as the antithesis of turbo folk which was associated with rural culture, conservative values, extreme nationalism and right-wing politics in former Yugoslavia. He often criticises pop and rock musicians who add elements of folk and turbo folk to their repertoire in order to make their music more accessible to the public. For example, in Slobodna Dalmacija he famously wrote an article lambasting the Ivan Zajc theatre in Rijeka for the decision to hire popular musician and advocate of turbo folk Severina Vuƒçkoviƒá for a production of the popular musical Karolina Rijeƒçka in 2003.

He has also been a speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter and editor of The New Republic, and is the author of ¬°Ob√°manos! The Rise of a New Political Era and Politics: Observations & Arguments. In 2009, Forbes named Hertzberg one of the \\"25 Most Influential Liberals in the U.S. Media,\\" placing him at number seventeen. Background and education Hertzberg was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Hazel Manross (n√©e Whitman), a professor of history and education at Columbia University, and Sidney Hertzberg, a journalist and political activist. His father was Jewish (and had become an atheist); his mother was a Quaker with a Congregationalist background and of English descent, also a great-grandniece of Walt Whitman. Hertzberg was educated in the public schools of Rockland County, New York, and Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1965. Career =Early years= Hertzberg graduated from Suffern High School in Suffern, New York, after a semester as an exchange student in Toulouse, France. He began his writing career at The Harvard Crimson and eventually served as managing editor including writing on local and national politics. In addition, he was president of the Liberal Union, had a jazz program on WHRB, and belonged to the Signet Society. Consumed by his Crimson duties, Hertzberg landed on academic probation for a semester, which required him to withdraw from all extracurricular activities. He managed to continue to write Crimson pieces anyway, under the pseudonym Sidney Hart. William Shawn, the editor of the New Yorker, invited Hertzberg to talk about writing for the magazine. Shawn was familiar with Hertzberg's writing because his son‚Äîthe actor Wallace Shawn‚Äîwas a classmate of Hertzberg's at Harvard. Hertzberg declined the invitation and after graduating from Harvard in 1965 he took a draft-deferred position as editorial director for the U.S. National Student Association. The following year he joined the San Francisco bureau of Newsweek as a reporter. Hertzberg covered the rise of the hippies, the emergence of rock groups such as the Grateful Dead, Ronald Reagan's successful campaign for governor of California, and The Beatles' last concert. In 1967 he enlisted in the United States Navy and became an officer posted in New York City. By late 1968 due to his growing opposition to the Vietnam War he requested conscientious-objector status, which was denied. He was discharged at the end of his commitment in 1969. From 1969 to 1977 Hertzberg was a staff writer for the New Yorker;New Yorker bio of Hendrik Hertzberg Spy magazine characterized him during this period of his career as a \\"lothario.\\" =Politics= During the 1976 election, Hertzberg wrote speeches for Governor Hugh Carey of New York. After the election, he was recruited to join Carter's speech writing team by James Fallows. After Fallows departed in 1979, Hertzberg became Carter's chief speechwriter. Hertzberg was an author of President Jimmy Carter's July 15, 1979, speech on energy conservation, widely known as the \\"Malaise Speech\\" and critiqued as one of the most ineffective pieces of political rhetoric in American history.Daniel Dale. \\"The worst speech of all time,\\" TheStar.com \\"This is a speech I consider one of the worst speeches in the history of the presidency,\\" says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \\"There are many pedestrian speeches. You can say, \`Well, they're just bad speeches.' No, they're pedestrian speeches; they're not bad, they're just ordinary. This speech actually has serious inherent rhetorical failures. Usually speechwriters protect a president from that.\\" \\"Malaise or Maligned? Jimmy Carter‚Äôs Address to the Nation on July 15, 1979 \\" by Elvin T. Lim Department of Political Science University of Tulsa Prepared for delivery at the 2005 Meeting of the Western Political Science Association, March 16 ‚Äì 19, Oakland, California. \\"President Jimmy Carter‚Äôs ‚ÄúEnergy and National Goals Address to the Nation‚Äù on July 15, 1979, better known as infamous ‚Äúmalaise‚Äù speech The reaction by some Americans, who were suffering from high unemployment and an American industrial economy in severe recession, was that President Carter blamed them for the economic problems they were facing when they believed that Carter himself was ineffective in alleviating the recession. Others, however, point out that calls and letters to the White House were overwhelmingly positive, and that Carter's approval rating in polls climbed 11 points. Vice President Walter Mondale predicted that the speech would not be well received. Hertzberg's personal favorite speech is Carter's farewell address of January 14, 1981. It opens with Carter declaring that he leaves the White House \\"to take up once more the only title in our democracy superior to that of President, the title of citizen.\\"President Jimmy Carter's Farewell Address, January 14, 1981 As a liberal author,Granick, Jennifer and Sprigman, Christopher (2013-06-27) The Criminal N.S.A., The New York Times he also expostulates on the necessity of humanism and secularism in democratic societies and critiques the Conservative Revolution. Hertzberg believes that America‚Äôs system of winner-take-all elections, federalism, and separation of powers is out of date and damaging to political responsibility and democratic accountability. Hertzberg is a frequent guest on television programs, such as Democracy Now!. In 2004, Hertzberg contributed $2,000 to John Kerry. =Later career= Hertzberg was twice editor of The New Republic, from 1981 to 1985 and then from 1989 to 1992, alternating in that job with Michael Kinsley. In between his stints as editor he wrote for that and other magazines and was a fellow at two institutes at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government: the Institute of Politics and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy.

First Edition. (New York City: Vintage Books (a Division of Random House, 2004), p. 40. Family Cornelius May is said to be from the city of Hoorn but may have been born in the small village of Schellinkhout, just east of Hoorn, as he appears to have been the brother of Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout, after whom the island of Jan Mayen is named.Samuel Muller Geschiedenis van de Noordsche Compagnie., Gebr van der Post, 1874, footnote on page 167 Both brothers were the cousin of, in his day, a far more famous sailor, Jan Cornelisz May,Gerben Kazimier History of Schellinkhout 1601-1650 who led several expeditions to explore the Northeast passage and between 1614 and 1617 circumnavigated the world with Joris van Spilbergen. 1614 to 1616 expeditions to New Netherland May sailed first in the Mauritius River or \\"Hudson's river\\" (so referred to first by Adriaen Block in 1613) in 1614 where an agreement was made among various competing traders. On October 11, 1614, May became a party to the New Netherland Company which received an exclusive patent from the States General for four voyages to be undertaken for three years to territories discovered between the 40th and 45th parallels at the exclusion of all other Dutch (until January 1618). From August until November 1616, the company tried unsuccessfully to obtain a new patent for a territory situated between the 38th and 40th parallels (i.e., the Delaware Bay area) which in 1614, and 1615 had been surveyed by Cornelis Hendricksz from Monnikendam on the ship Onrust. In 1616 Cornelis Hendricksen, sailed the Onrust up the Zuyd Rivier (literally \\"South River,\\" today known as the Delaware River) from its bay to its northernmost navigable reaches, on a voyage to ransom three fur traders taken from Fort Nassau on the North River.Wheeler, Edward Smith. Scheyichbi and the Strand, J.B. Lippincott & Company, Philadelphia, 1876 On behalf of the successor company of the New Netherland Company, Cornelius Jacobsen May had explored and surveyed the Delaware Bay on the ship named Blijde Boodschap (en. \\"Joyful Message\\") from which he carried on trade with the Indians there in 1620. In 1621, he ordered the construction of factorij of Fort Nassau at the mouth of the Big Timber Creek. Two of the six business partners of the ships Blijde Boodschap and Bever which focused on exploration and trade in the Zuidt Rivier or Delaware River, were Thijmen Jacobsz Hinlopen and Samuel Godijn. Cape Hinlopen, now spelled Cape Henlopen in Delaware is named after the former. Cape Hinlopen was New Netherland's most southern border on the 38th parallel. Samuel Godyn had Godyn's Bay named after him, now renamed Delaware Bay. Also spelled Godijn or Godin, he was one of the first patroons in New Netherland as well as a director of the West India Company and of the Northern Company. First colonists to New Netherland May was unable to trade in the South River (Delaware River) to the exclusion of competing Dutch companies. Though the competing Dutch companies were eventually able to reach agreement in New Netherland, discord arose again which was settled, finally, by a judgment of arbitrators at Amsterdam on December 23, 1623. The 38th and 39th parallels region came under the final jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company with the delivery of the first settlers to New Netherland in 1624, mostly Walloon and Flemish families.\\"Cornelius Jacobsen Mey\\", New Netherland Institute May was the captain of the ship New Netherland who delivered the first boat load of colonists to New Netherland, first at Fort Orange, the trading post near present-day Albany, and then on Governors Island, in present-day NYC, that year. In the spring of 1624, Cornelius Jacobsen May returned to New Netherlands in command of the Nieu Nederlandt, with the first group of settlers, mostly young Walloon families. Some were sent to company lands in Connecticut, while two families and eight single males took a sloop to the Zuidt (South) River, now the Delaware River, and established Fort Wilhelmus. Eight men were also left on Nut Island to promote the fur trade, and the remaining eighteen families proceeded upriver to Fort Orange.Klein, Milton M., The Empire State, Cornell University Press, 2005 Having so transformed the New Netherland territory to a province, he was named the province's first director.

Located at Salisbury Road, it was built by the former Urban Council and, since 2000, has been administered by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. A wide variety of cultural performances are held here. Location The centre is located on the southwestern tip of Tsim Sha Tsui, on the former location of the Kowloon Station of the Kowloon-Canton Railway. Adjacent to the centre on the west is the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier of the Star Ferry, while to the east are the Hong Kong Space Museum and Hong Kong Museum of Art. The historic Clock Tower stands between the centre and the pier. History As early as 1970, the Urban Council pressed for construction of a new cultural venue in Kowloon of the same modern standard as the City Hall in Central. The cultural centre project was formally announced in 1974 to be planned on the site of the former Kowloon Station. At this time, construction was expected to begin in 1975. However, the project faced financial constraints and was delayed. It was reexamined in 1978 and given top priority by the Urban Council, but cost estimates rose from $190 million to $474 million and the project was again shelved for some time. When construction finally began, the demolition of the historic railway station occupying the site was extremely controversial. The centre was designed by then-Public Works Department chief architect Jos√© Lei. Originally operated by the Urban Council, the venue was officially opened in a ceremony on 8 November 1989 officiated by Charles, Prince of Wales and Princess Diana, who unveiled a commemorative plaque. The $10 million Rieger Orgelbau organ was installed from August to November in 1989 and involved the complicated installation of 8,000 pipes. The cultural centre opened with the International Celebration of the Arts, a special programme that ran from 5 November to 6 December and showcased Hong Kong musicians, Kunju opera, Cantonese music, and performances by a range of international artists including the Cologne Opera, the Alban Berg Quartett, Sadao Watanabe, and the first Hong Kong appearance of guitarist John Williams. Facilities * The Concert Hall, with 2,019 seats, is an oval two-tiered auditorium finished with high quality oak, and includes an adjustable acoustic canopy and curtains. It is the home of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. It houses an 8,000-pipe pipe organ, the largest in Asia, built by Austrian firm Rieger Orgelbau. It has been recorded by Christopher Herrick on Organ Fireworks VIII. * The Grand Theatre, with 1,734 seats in three tiers, was designed for large scale opera, ballet, and musicals. The Hong Kong Film Award presentation ceremony also takes place there. * The Studio Theatre, with 300 to 496 seats depending upon the set-up, can accommodate smaller-scale theatre and performance works. * Exhibition Gallery * 4 foyer exhibition areas. * 11 rehearsal and practice rooms. Transport The centre is adjacent to the Star Ferry Pier and the Star Ferry bus terminus served by Kowloon Motor Bus. It is also within walking distance to Tsim Sha Tsui Station and East Tsim Sha Tsui Station, which serve the Tsuen Wan Line and West Rail Line respectively.

John started working on Sarfarosh in 1992. Seven years were spent on the research, pre-production and production till it finally released in 1999. The film deals with an Indian police officer's quest to stop cross-border terrorism. The film was released just before the Kargil conflict when tensions between India and Pakistan were high. On release, the film was both, critically and commercially, successful. The movie received praise, for the cast performances, especially Khan, Shah and Rishi. Its technical aspects, music and story were also praised. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film, and was screened at the International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Sathyameva Jayathe with Devaraj and in Telugu as Astram (2006) with Vishnu Manchu and Anushka Shetty.  Plot  Arms trafficking is taking place in India. An arsenal enters Indian territory via the state of Rajasthan, which makes its way to interior of India with help of many middlemen. Bala Thakur, a gun handler in Chandrapur, provides the arms to Veeran, a forest dwelling brigand. Later, Veeran and his gang attack a wedding bus, mercilessly gunning down every person in it which includes women and children. The government appoints a Special Action Team in Mumbai to trace the roots behind the attack. The team learns about Bala Thakur, but thanks to his informants, Thakur flees before he can be apprehended. Meanwhile, ACP Ajay Singh Rathore (Aamir Khan), a resident of Mumbai, is attending a concert by the famed ghazal singer Gulfam Hassan (Naseeruddin Shah), a Muhajir, where he spots a familiar face, Seema (Sonali Bendre). Ajay had a crush over Seema when they were studying in Delhi, but never got the courage to propose to her. The duo are happy to meet each other again and gradually fall in love. Gulfam, on the other hand, is Indian by birth, but had to move to Pakistan as a child during partition. Deeply scarred due to the experience, he is still happy that the Government allows him to live in his palatial residence whenever he comes to India. Gulfam finds a huge fan in Ajay, who used to attend his programs as a child. Despite the age difference, the two bond. Inspector Salim (Mukesh Rishi) a Muslim inspector is taken off from the Special Action Team when a notorious gangster Sultan(Pradeep Rawat) escapes his clutches and he is severely reprimanded by his superior for this failure and for causing the death of three other officers in the attempt. Despite being an honest and upright police officer with the best intelligence gathering network in the force, Salim is rueful that he is being given second class treatment because he is a Muslim and is being perceived as having let Sultan escape because he was a Muslim as well. His anger at the system doesn't lessen when Ajay, though an IPS officer but younger and inexperienced, is told to head the team. Ajay wants Salim on the team unofficially as he has good network of informants, but Salim refuses. It is revealed that Ajay's father was going to testify against some terrorist who had threatened him not to testify, but in an attempt to stop them from doing so, Ajay's elder brother was killed. Ajay's father was kidnapped and by the time the terrorists spared him, the man had lost his voice. This motivated Ajay to join the police force. Unknown to Ajay, Gulfam is also working for the Pakistani intelligence which is attempting to create havoc in India and indulge in a proxy war with India. Since Gulfam likes Ajay, he sees to it that nothing untoward happens to him. Here, Salim finds the location of Bala Thakur along with the information that Sultan, the man who escaped from his clutches, will also be there. Salim gives the information to Ajay who makes peace with Salim and convinces him to join the team again. An encounter at the criminals' rendezvous results in the death of Bala Thakur and Ajay is seriously injured. Though Sultan and his right-hand man Shiva manage to escape, the operation is deemed a success as the team is able to intercept a large consignment of lethal arms and ammunition meant for terrorist Veeran and his terrorist acts around the country. Sultan is later assassinated on Gulfams orders because of his failure and false information is leaked that he has escaped to Pakistan. While recuperating, Ajay has an epiphany which leads the team to Bahid in Rajasthan and to \\"Mirchi Seth\\" Rambandhu Gupta(Akhilendra Mishra). The investigative team save for Ajay and Salim camp in Bahid and gather all possible information on Mirchi Seth. Ajay comes over to Bahid to investigate and meets Gulfam who is temporarily staying in his ancestral manor near Bahid. Gulfam attempts to derail the investigation through political means and ordering an assault on Ajay to subvert the investigation, but of no avail. The repeated failures on Gulfam's part displease the senior officers in Pakistani Intelligence, who dispatch Major Aslam Baig to take care of the business. Here, Ajay goes through the information collected so far and realises that he has seen many key suspects near Gulfam, but fails to make the connection. The investigative team prepares for a final assault on the gun-running operation and in the pursuit of Mirchi Seth land up at Gulfam's mansion. Ajay feels betrayed when he learns of Gulfam's treachery, but is aware of lack of substantial evidence to indict Gulfam for his crimes. He goads and tricks Gulfam into killing Baig and arrests him for the offence. After realising what happened, Gulfam reveals how the incidents that happened during the partition embittered him and why he did those deeds. In retaliation, Ajay makes him realise that his actions are not benefiting people of any religion. After Ajay makes him see the error in his ways, Gulfam, unable to stand the humiliation and guilt, commits suicide. Gulfam's suicide is hushed up and the team returns triumphant to Mumbai to much accolades for busting the terrorist racket. At Mumbai Airport, Salim is tipped on the whereabouts of Veeran and Ajay embarks on another investigation with his team.

Naseeruddin Shah was specially praised for his role of a Muhajir. The reviewer for Filmfare rated the film four stars out of five and wrote, \\"What makes this film so exceptional is its carefully thought out characterization and brilliant performances. Although this is his first film, director John Mathew Matthan draws perfectly crafted outputs from his entire cast. Aamir brings the role of A.C.P. Rathod to a never-before-seen dimension of reality.\\" He further added, \\"Sarfarosh succeeds in connecting with the audiences, as it manages to transcend its medium and do a great deal more than just entertain.\\" Suparn Verma of Rediff.com felt that the film \\"manages to marry serious cinema with the commercial variety\\" and wrote that the \\"script has this no-nonsense look to it, clearly and succinctly establishing the protagonist's past ...\\" In addition to commending the acting performances of Naseeruddin Shah, Aamir Khan and Sonali Bendre, he lauded the departments of direction, music, choreography, and called the camerawork \\"good in parts but lack[ing] technical finesse\\".

He studied at Vanderbilt University and wrote his doctoral thesis under the Southern Agrarian and Fugitive Poet Donald DavidsonGordon, David (2010-04-01) Southern Cross: The meaning of the Mel Bradford moment , The American Conservative (whose biography Bradford was wrapping up at the time of his sudden death at age 58), and thus was admitted to the succession of this movement to recover the Southern tradition. Bradford was first and foremost a literary scholar and a student of rhetoric. He was known in literary circles for his work on William Faulkner, where Bradford stressed the importance of the Southern setting and the primacy of community in understanding the action of Faulkner's novels and stories. He \\"had no truck with critical efforts to portray Faulkner as alienated from the South. To the contrary, he saw the novelist as thoroughly embedded within his native region.\\" Outside of literature he wrote extensively on the subjects of history and culture. Bradford specialized in the history of the American founding and Southern history in the United States. Bradford also advocated the constitutional theory of strict constructionism. \\"The original understanding of the Constitution, Bradford maintained, conformed much more closely to the Southern position than to Lincoln's acts of usurpation.\\" Bradford also frequently wrote for Modern Age, Chronicles magazine and Southern Partisan magazine. Biography Bradford was born in Fort Worth, Texas and grew up there. He studied English at University of Oklahoma and completed his bachelor's and master's degrees. He then continued his education at Vanderbilt University and graduated with a Ph.D. He stayed in academia and taught at several institutions of higher education, including United States Naval Academy, Northwestern State University of Louisiana, and, primarily, the University of Dallas from 1967 until his death.Michael M. Jordan, Bradford, M. E., 03/10/10 In U.S. presidential elections Bradford campaigned for Barry Goldwater in 1964, George C. Wallace in 1972, Ronald Reagan in 1976 and 1980, and Pat Buchanan in 1992. He was for a time the President of the Philadelphia Society. He died in 1993 after undergoing heart surgery.https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/obituaries/melvin- bradford-58-conservative-theorist.html?pagewanted=1?pagewanted=1 NEH Nomination In 1980, Dr. Bradford was initially tapped by President-elect Ronald Reagan for chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. According to David Gordon, \\"Reagan's wish to elevate him to the prestigious post did not stem solely from Bradford's academic credentials. The president and he were acquaintances, and he had worked hard in Reagan's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Influential conservatives such as Russell Kirk and Sen. Jesse Helms also knew and admired Bradford.\\" The selection met with intense objections from neoconservative figures, centering partly on Bradford's criticisms of President Abraham Lincoln. They circulated quotes of Bradford calling Lincoln \\"a dangerous man,\\" and saying, \\"The image of Lincoln rose to be very dark\\" and \\"indeed almost sinister.\\"Briefing, The New York Times, October 22, 1981. He was even accused of comparing Lincoln to Adolf Hitler. \\"Bradford rejected Lincoln because he saw him as a revolutionary, intent on replacing the American Republic established by the Constitution with a centralized and leveling despotism.\\" Another issue was Bradford's support for the 1972 presidential campaign of George C. Wallace.\\"Melvin Bradford, 58, Conservative Theorist\\", The New York Times, March 9, 1993. The neoconservative choice, William Bennett, was substituted for Bradford on November 13, 1981.Scholar Chosen as Humanities Chief, The New York Times, November 14, 1981. A letter supporting Bradford's nomination, sent to President Reagan during the controversy, was signed by John East, Jesse Helms, John Tower, Strom Thurmond, Orrin Hatch, Jeremiah Denton, Dan Quayle and James McClure and eight other Republican senators. Gerhart Niemeyer, Russell Kirk, Jeffrey Hart, William Buckley, M.

The people of Kufa called upon Husayn to overthrow the Umayyad dynasty who was on his way to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage. He wanted to confirm the loyalty of the people of Kufa, so he sent his cousin and his ambassador, Muslim ibn Aqeel, a famous warrior, to Kufa to observe the situation. He sent a letter to Hussain confirming their loyalty, before knowing that the 30,000 followers that he gained would all betray him for their lives. He was executed by the newly installed governor, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, on the 9th of Zilhaj, 60 AH,http://www.hujjat.org/index.php?option=com_content&id;=142:hadhrat-muslim- ibn-aqeel-a&catid;=28&Itemid;=100013 and is buried at the back of Great Mosque of Kufa. Journey to Kufa = Letters from Kufa= Hussain ibn Ali received thousands of letters from people of Kufa stating that they were rejecting their governor and asking him to come and serve as their Imam. One letter in particular contained these words: \\"We invite you to come to Kufa as we have no Imam to guide us. Through you Allah will unite us on the path of truth\\". A few days later, the people of Kufa sent an emissary, a special messenger, to Husayn ibn Ali to persuade him to go to Kufa. There followed hundreds of other letters and many special emissaries from the people of Kufa to Hussain ibn Ali. Receiving so many petitions and messages from Kufa, Husayn ibn Ali decided to send Muslim ibn Aqeel, who was a famous warrior, as his emissary to Kufa to study the situation there and report to Hussain ibn Ali.Rogerson, Barnaby. The Heirs of Muhammad. Woodstock, NY: The Overlook Press, 2006. =Muslim's Assignment= He wrote a letter to the people of Kufa and gave it to Muslim ibn Aqeel. In this letter Husayn ibn Ali said, \\"I am sending my cousin and one of the most trusted ones from my family, Muslim ibn Aqeel, to report to me about your affairs. If his report agrees with what you have written I will soon be with you. You must be clear of the fact that the Imam is the only one who follows the book of Allah, and serves Allah in all matters and affairs with justice, honesty and truth\\".Jafri, Syed Husian Mohammad. The Origins and Early Development of Shi'a Islam. Oxford: Orxford UP, 2000. Husayn ibn Ali also told Ibn Aqeel: \\"Muslim, the whole world knows that you are one of the bravest warriors. It is just possible that seeing you in Kufa some people may think that our intention is to fight Yazid. Take your two sons Muhammad and Ibrahim with you. When they see you with such young children, they will know that our intentions are peaceful\\". According to reports, Muslim ibn Aqeel's sons were so young, that they could not even tie up the buttons of their shirts. Husayn sent three people with Muslim: Qays Ibn Mash'ar, 'Imarah Ibn 'Abdullah al-Saluli, and 'Abdul Rahman Ibn 'Abdullah al-Azd, in addition to the messenger from Kufa.Kitab al-Irshad. Excerpts from al-Islam.org =Traveling to Kufa= This group set off from Mecca on the 15th of Ramadan. His first destination was Medina, where he left his family and hired two people to guide him on his way. The guides, however, lost their way in the desert and were too weak from lack of water to continue on. But in their weakened physical state, they managed to show Muslim the right direction before they both died of thirst. In Kufa = Kufans' Pledge of Allegiance= Muslim arrived in Kufa on 5 Shawwal 60 AH/ 9 July 680. He went first to the house of al-Mukhtar ibn Abu 'Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who was highly liked by his people and who later became the person who ordered the murder of Ibn Ziyad.Wellhausen, Julius. The Religio-Political Factions in Early Islam. New York: U of Hull, 1975. More than 18,000-30,000 people appeared before Muslim ibn Aqeel and enthusiastically pledged their allegiance to Husayn ibn Ali as their Imam and pledged to support Husayn even with their lives.Tabari. Excerpts from Al-Islam.org. Muslim ibn Aqeel, encouraged by this response, reported to Husayn ibn Ali by letter that he should proceed to Kufa. The governor of Kufa, al-Nu'man Ibn Bashir, was told of Muslim's arrival, but refused to attack him. Bashir was a mild man and did not want to harm the members of the family of the Prophet, so he did nothing to stop Muslim.Ayoub, Mahmoud. Redeptive Suffering in Islam. London: U of Toronto, 1978. Many of the supporters of Yazid saw this lack of action as a sign of weakness and encouraged the caliph to replace Bashir with a stronger man. Yazid then deposed Bashir and replaced him with Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Ibn Ziyad was a resourceful and often cruel politician who spared nothing in order to attain political ends. His strong and ruthless character was exactly what the caliph was looking for in order to gain control in Kufa. Yazid wrote to him, \\"Go to Kufa, capture Muslim ibn 'Aqil and see what is appropriate to imprison him, send him to exile or kill him.\\"Kohlberg, E. \\"Muslim B. Akil B. Ali Talib\\" The Encyclopedia of Islam. 2nd ed. Online. =Governor's Warning= The morning of his arrival in Kufa, Ibn Ziyad gathered the people at the grand mosque. There he delivered a speech warning them against mutiny and promised them generous rewards for conforming. He said, \\"Anyone found to be sheltering one of those who scheme against the authority of the commander of the faithful and who does not hand him over will be crucified on the door of his own house\\". =Searching for Muslim= During this time, Ibn Ziyad was working diligently to discover the hiding place of Muslim. He knew that the people of Kufa were meeting secretly, but he was not able to figure out the location. Ibn Ziyad decided that the best way to find Muslim would be to infiltrate his inner circle. He called upon his servant, Ma'qil, to meet him. He gave Ma'qil three thousand dirhams and ordered him to meet with the Shi'as. He was to tell them that he was a Syrian slave who has just arrived in the country and wanted to hand deliver a donation to Muslim. Ma'qil entered the grand mosque and was introduced to Muslim. Ma'qil then delivered the money and swore allegiance to him. This servant continued to meet with Muslim in the coming days. No secrets were kept from him, so he kept gathering information, which he then reported back to Ibn Ziyad in the evenings. =Hani's Arrest= With the information from Ma'qil, Ibn Ziyad was able to figure out that Muslim was staying at the house of Hani. The governor gathered some of the friends of Hani and asked why he had not visited in quite a while. They made excuses for him, saying that he had been sick and other similar things. Hani was then summoned by the governor who accused him of harboring Muslim in his house. Hani denied this claim and things got heated. Ibn Ziyad then called in Ma'qil and had him corroborate the story that Ibn Ziyad was trying to paint. At this point, Hani was arrested, beaten in the face with an iron-tipped cane, and thrown into prison and was later executed with Muslim ibn Aqeel. Muslim reported to Husayn through Abis ibn Shabib that most of the people in Kufa were ready to receive him as their Imam and advised that Husayn should proceed to Kufa (Tareekh-e-Tabri, Vol.6, Page211). Amongst the people of Kufa there were many spies employed by Yazid to report to him directly. When Yazid heard from them of the invitations to Hussain and the arrival in Kufa of Muslim he was filled with fury. He sent a message to his Governor in Basrah, Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, to go to Kufa and take over the position of Nu'amaan ibne Basheer. Ibn Ziyad was also told to arrest Muslim and murder him and do all that was necessary to suppress the Shiahs in Kufa. Ibn Ziyad was a shrewd man. He kept his journey from Basra to Kufa a secret and just before entering Kufa he covered his face with a black scarf so that he could not be recognized. He had a few horsemen in front of him and a few behind him as he entered Kufa. The people of Kufa had been waiting for the arrival of Imam Hussain anxiously and they presumed that the Imam had arrived. Soon people started gathering around him and singing welcoming songs. Ibn Ziyad kept observing the people and memorizing faces as the crowd grew and soon it was difficult for his convoy to proceed swiftly. One of his guards, Muslim bin Amr Bahili, shouted \\"Clear the way, this is the Amir Ubaidullah ibn Ziyad\\". Hearing this, people started running away quickly and when Ibn Ziyad reached the Dar-al-Amara only a handful people had been left. Ibn Ziyad arrived in Kufa on the evening of 2nd Dhul-Hajj. On the following day he went to the mosque and addressed the people of Kufa. He first announced his appointment as Yazid's governor. He then threatened any one who was engaged in any activity against the government with immediate death, and ordered them to surrender Muslim to him. Ibn Ziyad sealed Kufa in such a way that no one could go in or out of the city without the governor's permission. Death Since several people knew that he was staying with Mukhtar Thaqafi, Muslim decided to move from there as a measure of precaution and protection. At the invitation of Hani ibn Urwah, another leading member of the Shia community, he moved to Hani's house. This was done secretly and except for a few people no one knew where Muslim was. Through a spy, Maaqal, who pretended to be a Shia, Ibn Ziyad found out where Muslim was. Since ibn Ziyad had prior relations with Hani, he called him by trick to his palace and got him arrested and thrown into prison. Muslim got the news of Hani's arrest and not wishing to further endanger the lives of his friends, Muslim and his two sons left Hani's house. He left the children with Shurayb, a judge, and went into the desert to try to get back to Husayn to warn him not to go to Kufa. This was the 7th of Dhul-Hajj. That whole day and the following day Muslim tried to get out of the city. He found all the exits sealed and guarded by Ibn Ziyad's soldiers. = Muslim at the House of Tuwaa = On the 7th, late in the evening, tired, hungry and exhausted, Muslim knocked on the door of a house on the outskirts of the city. A lady named 'Tuwaa\\" opened the door. Muslim requested for a little water to quench his thirst. The lady gave him water. When she learnt who he was, she invited him in and offered him shelter for the night. She gave Muslim food and water and took him to a room where he spent the night. Late that night Tuwaa's son came home. When he learned that the man Ibn Ziyad was looking for was in his mother's house, he felt that he would be rewarded by the governor if he got Muslim arrested. Unknown to his mother he slipped out in the darkness of the night and gave the information to a captain in Ibn Ziyad's army. Early the next morning, five hundred soldiers under the leadership of Mohammad bin Ashas surrounded the house of Tuwaa and demanded Muslim's surrender. Muslim came out holding his sword. Three times he drove the enemy away and killed 150 men. Twice Ibn Ziyad had to send in reinforcements. While Muslim was fighting, some soldiers went up the rooftops and began throwing stones and lighted torches at him. Others dug a trench in the path of Muslim and covered it with grass. Ibn Ziyad told his commanders to trick Muslim otherwise it would not be possible to capture him. Although badly wounded and totally exhausted, Muslim kept on fighting. As a trick, soldiers of Ibn Ziyad offered peace and protection to Muslim but he rejected the offer. He was deeply wounded in this tough fight and finally fell into the trench. He was pounced upon, chained and dragged to the court of Ibn Ziyad. =Execution= Historians narrate that Muslim was badly wounded when he entered the court of Ibn Ziyad. His teeth were broken and blood was flowing from all over. Still he entered the court like a 'Lion'. Someone in the court told him to pay respect to Ibn Ziyad because he is the \\"Amir\\" (Ruler). Muslim refused and replied that his Amir was only Husayn. Ibn Ziyad told Muslim that he would be killed and asked him if he had any last wishes. Muslim replied saying, \\"I owe a debt which should be discharged by selling off my sword and armour. Secondly I want my body to be given a proper burial. Thirdly I want a message sent to Hussain advising him not to come to Kufa.\\" Ibn Ziyad agreed to the first request but refused to do anything about the second and third requests. He then ordered Muslim to be taken to the roof of the palace to be executed and his body thrown to the ground. Muslim was calm and composed as he was dragged up the steps. He was reciting \\"Allahu Akber\\" until the last moment. Then there was an absolute silence followed by a thud as the head of Muslim was chopped and his body fell to the ground. This was on the 9th of Dhul-Hujja. Immediately after Muslim was killed, Hani ibn Urwah as well was dragged to the roof top and executed. Ibn Ziyad ordered Muqair Ibn Obran-e- Ahmari to take him to the palace's roof. They went to the top of the fortress, Muslim was decapitated in front of the people, his head was thrown down first and then followed by his body. Hani was also executed. They were executed in this way in order to intimidate the populace. Ibn Ziyad ordered that the bodies of these two men be dragged by their feet through the streets and marketplaces in Kufa. Muslim's body was then crucified upside down and the heads of Muslim and Hani were sent to Yazid to be displayed on the streets of Damascus. Muslim bin Aqeel's two sons, Mohammad and Ibrahim, were also killed in Kufa. He Was Then Buried By Hani Ibn Urwas Tribe Alongside Him =Muslim is made a Shaheed= Muslim called on the people of Kufa for assistance and narrations say that approximately 40,000 people accompanied him to the government building. By then, Ibn Ziyad had placed the leaders of Kufa on the roof top of the building and threatened to kill them if they did not leave Muslim bin Aqeel. Within a short while, not one person from the 40,000 was with Muslim. Muslim was later taken by the soldiers of Ibn Ziyaad and was martyred. Later, the two sons of Muslim were also martyred. These were two young children who accompanied their father, thinking that they were journeying to a place that was filled with true followers of the Ahle Bait. =Husayn departs for Kufa= On receiving the letter of Muslim, Hussain departed from Makkah and left for Kufa. When this group of the Ahlul Bayt left Makkah, every person and every child stood watching them with sadness as they left. Their eyes filled with tears and their hearts heavy with sadness. On his way, he received news of the death of Muslim and his children. Hussain was also informed of the betrayal of the people of Kufa. He was very sad when he heard this news and read In'na lil'laahi Wa in'na ilaihi Raaji'oon. He then comforted the family members and gave them hope. When the Ahlul Bayt reached a place called Thaa'lba, Hussain rested for a while. He awoke with tears in his eyes. His beloved sister, Zainab asked the reason for this, and he said, \\"I dreamt of our grandfather, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wa‚Äôaleh Wasallam. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wa‚Äôaleh Wasallam was crying and he said \\"O Hussain! You are soon to come and meet with me.\\" On hearing this, Ali Akbar the son of Hussain said, \\" O my dear father! Are we not on Haq (truth)?\\" Hussain replied, \\"verily we are on Haq and Haq is with us.\\" Then Ali Akbar said, \\"why then should we fear death, O my father? We all must pass from this world one day. I am seeing the gardens of Shahaadat and a mansion better than that of the world and bounties even greater than that of this world are before us.\\" Legacy While Muslim was not killed at Karbala, he is counted as one of the martyrs of the battle.Dorraj, Manochehr. \\"Symbolic nd Utilitarian Political Value of a Tradition: Martyrdom in the Iranian Political Culture\\" The Review of Politics. Summer 1997:511. JSTOR. The Shi'ite recommend visiting his grave in Kufa and there are certain prayers that are to be recited there. On the other hand, there is the mausoleum of Ruqayyah bint Ali (Wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel) located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.[1] Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies (one is Ruqqayah herself and others are Muslim's sisters) from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt). Today, Muslim ibn Aqeel's descendants go by the surname \\"Uqaili\\" and are found in Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq.

It was both developed and published by Konami. The game is a 3D aerial combat simulation, featuring many jet fighter aircraft. The game is single player only and has been compared to Ace Combat by GameSpy and GameSpot. At the time of the game's release, Airforce Delta was the only combat flight simulation game available for the Dreamcast. A Game Boy Color version of Airforce Delta was also released in 2000. A sequel, called Airforce Delta Storm in North America (Airforce Delta II in Japan and Deadly Skies in Europe), was also released for the Xbox platform in 2001 and for Game Boy Advance in 2002. The Game Boy Advance version, while having the same name as the sequel, has a plot based mostly on the previous game in the series, Airforce Delta. A second sequel, called Airforce Delta Strike in North America (Airforce Delta: Blue Wing Knights in Japan and Deadly Skies III in Europe), was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. A third sequel, called Airforce Delta Alternative, was released for Mobile Phones in 2007 in Japan only.  Game features  =Story= Players take control of a mercenary that has been contracted to complete a number of strategic military missions. Each mission completed earns the player money, and the more money that is accumulated, the more sophisticated aircraft the player can purchase. Players select from a myriad of fighters and take to the skies to defend a newly independent Republic of Laconia from its many enemies‚Äîfor fame, for glory, and most of all: for a price. The first mission involves a preemptive strike against numerous fighter planes that are planning to bomb the Laconian capital city of Naxos. The game centers around the Federated Republic of Dzavailar. Ethnic tension and religious debate have caused the Republic to split into independent states. The defenseless Republic of Laconia is in dire need of military support. Rebels from the former Federated Republic of Dzavailar have decided to reunite a territory long divided by ethnic conflict. After years of civil war, Laconia is the only republic left standing and has asked a mercenary defense organization to help keep it from falling to the dreaded unification movement. As a commissioned lieutenant assigned to the Delta Squadron, you are about to embark on a series of over 20 missions in very hostile territories. You have been brought on board because you are the best in the business: a crack pilot who can take out multiple bogeys without batting an eyelash. It is your aerial experience that Laconia is banking on, since you will be alone throughout the campaign. Airforce Delta takes place on the fictitious continent of Dzavailar. A radical government called the \\"People's Federation of Dzavailar\\" is intent on conquering all of former Federated Republic of Dzavailar territories, and they already have most of its newly independent provinces under siege. The last remaining free republic has called upon Airforce Delta, an elite group of mercenary fighter jet pilots, to defeat the People's Federation and liberate the continent. You are the newest recruit in AFD, and you are given a series of 20 missions to carry out. Before each mission, you are given a briefing which gives details on destroying a certain number of targets. =Gameplay= Airforce Delta features simplistic controls with an emphasis on arcade-style action rather than accurate flight simulation. The mission briefings are complete with an illustrated step-by- step guide which shows you your designated targets and the ideal path to take. After completing a mission, players are awarded with money that can later be used to purchase superior aircraft. Variables such as mission completion time and the number of enemies you have disposed of dictate the amount of money you will receive. When making a buying decision, choosing an aircraft most appropriate for the job is of the utmost importance. The most expensive does not necessarily mean the most practical. Missions typically involve either seeking out and destroying the enemy or escorting friendly craft to a certain destination. The enemies encountered in Airforce Delta are diverse and range from air to ground and water capabilities and from offensive to defensive situations. Mission maps are based on fictional locations. Airforce Delta features over thirty aircraft to take for a test flight. They are all based on real life aircraft both in looks and in handling. Some of the planes available for these missions include the F-4 Phantom, F-14 Tomcat, A-10 Thunderbolt, Mig 29, Su-27 and the F-22 Raptor. Reception The Dreamcast version of the game received average reviews, while the Game Boy Color version received unfavorable reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version a score of 31 out of 40.

The zip code is 92328, the elevation is , and the population is fewer than 4. Death Valley Junction is home to the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel, where resident Marta Becket staged dance and mime shows from the late 1960s until her last show in February 2012. Becket died in 2017. The hotel is still operating next to the opera house, but beyond these maintained areas, the town is in a state of disrepair. There is no gas station, and only one restaurant, the Amargosa Cafe. The town is owned by the non-profit Amargosa Opera House Inc. which runs the Opera House, Hotel, and cafe The community's location, east-southeast of Furnace Creek, on the east side of Death Valley is south of Nevada's Amargosa Valley and near Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge. East/South East, 27 miles, is Pahrump, Nevada. South on SR127 is the town of Shoshone, California. The closest straight-line distance to the Nevada state line is roughly five miles northeast. Government documents show an effort by the Timbisha Shoshone tribal government to acquire about in the area during 1999 to 2000. This includes areas for residences and the official federal sanction to use some government lands for traditional ceremonies. In 2017 the tribe constructed a cannabis grow facility on the land. History The town was created in 1907 when the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad was constructed through the Amargosa Valley and a spur from their main line was built to the Lila C. borax mine in the hills to the west. The town was originally owned by Robert Tubb, who operated a saloon, store, and brothel. The town first appears on the 1910 Furnace Creek Quandrangle USGS topographic map. In 1914, the Death Valley Railroad started operating between Ryan, California and Death Valley Junction. It carried borax until 1928, when operations ceased. From 1923 to 1925 the Pacific Coast Borax Company constructed buildings in the town, hiring architect Alexander Hamilton McCulloch to design a Spanish Colonial Revival whistle stop centered at the hotel, theater and office complex building, now known as the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel. The town began to decline in the mid-20th century. However, in 1967 dancer and actress Marta Becket happened to visit due to an automobile repair. She became enamored with the theater, and with help from benefactors, she leased, then purchased, the hotel and theater complex. The Death Valley post office opened in 1908 and transferred to Furnace Creek Ranch in 1961. The Amargosa post office opened in 1962, changed its name to Death Valley Junction in 1968. In 1980 the town was included in the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Death Valley Junction Historic District.\\" When the Death Valley Railroad was established in 1914, it used of tracks belonging to the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad east-southeast of Death Valley Junction to Horton. =Telephone history= The bottom instruction card of Death Valley Junction #2, a non-dial Western Electric 1A1 coin collector located at the Amagosa Opera House.

The following research into seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and mild depression is a relatively new possibility which has not previously been claimed by advocates of ionisation. Perhaps understandably the mainstream scientific community consider this particular application to be pseudoscience.  Research  For SAD, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing high (4.5x1014 ions/second) and low (1.7x1011 ions/second) flow rate negative air ionization with bright light therapy found that post-treatment improvement results were 57.1% for bright light (10,000 lux) compared with high-density ions, 47.9%; and low-density ions, 22.7%. An older RCT conducted by the same authors also found air ionization effective for SAD at 2.7x106 ions/cm3. A 2007 review considers this therapy \\"under investigation\\", and suggests that it may be a helpful treatment for SAD. An RCT comparing the short-term effects of bright light, an auditory stimulus, and high- and low-density negative ions on mood and alertness in mildly depressed and non-depressed adults found that the three first (active) stimuli, but not the low-density placebo, reduced depression on the Beck Depression Inventory scale; the auditory stimulus, bright light and high- density ions all produced rapid mood changes--with small to medium effect sizes--in depressed and non-depressed subjects. , the negative ion generators used are still undergoing multicenter phase II clinical trials. A separate randomized placebo-controlled study published in May 2010 found that the difference between high-density ion therapy and placebo (dim red light and low-density ions) was not statistically significant. The conclusion of this study was that bright white light therapy was significantly more effective than negative ion therapy for treating Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

It details the experiences that Corbett had in the Kumaon region of India from the 1900s to the 1930s, while hunting man-eating Bengal tigers and Indian leopards. One tiger, for example, was responsible for over 400 human deaths. Man-Eaters of Kumaon is the best known of Corbett's books and contains 10 stories of tracking and shooting man-eaters in the Indian Himalayas during the early years of the twentieth century. The text also contains incidental information on flora, fauna and village life. Seven of the stories were first published privately as Jungle Stories. Book contents * Introduction by Sir Maurice Harld * Preface by Lord Linlithgow * Authors Note: Causes of Man- eating in Tigers and Leopards * Champawat Man-eater: The story of the first man-eating tiger shot by Corbett in 1907. Reportedly the man-eater claimed 436 human victims in Nepal and India * Robin: Stories of Corbett's hunting companion Robin, his faithful spaniel. * The Chowgarh tigers: The first of three man-eaters Corbett was to shoot on government request at a 1929 district conference. It turned out to be a pair of two tigers, a mother and its grown cub, which had together killed 64 people between 1925-1930. The cub was shot in April 1929 and the mother on 11 April 1930. * The Bachelor of Powalgarh: The exciting tale of how Corbett shot the much sought after trophy tiger (non man-eater) in 1930. * The Mohan Man-eater: The second of the three man-eaters Corbett was requested to shoot at the 1929 conference.

Shot in 1933. * The Pipal Pani Tiger: Corbett traces 15 years of history of a local tiger (non man-eater), from its tracks in the mud as a cub, up until its death 15 years later * The Thak Man-eater: The last man-eater Corbett shot in November 1938 (aged 63) * Just Tigers: Corbett talks about the importance of conservation and his love of photographing tigers in the place of shooting them Origins After much prompting by friends and family in 1935 Corbett finally put to paper seven accounts of his jungle encounters. These were then made into a small book and 100 copies were privately published under the title Jungle Stories and distributed amongst friends. The stories were titled, \\"Wild Life in the Village: An Appeal,\\" \\"The Pipal Pani Tiger,\\" \\"The Fish of My Dreams,\\" \\"A Lost Paradise,\\" \\"The Terror that Walks by Night,\\" \\"Purnagiri and Its Mysterious Lights,\\" and \\"The Chowgarh Tigers.\\" In 1943, whilst Corbett was wheelchair bound recovering from typhus fever, his close friend (R.E. Hawkins) and manager of India's branch of Oxford Press convinced him to write a book for publishing. Using the 1935 Jungle Stories as a basis, Corbett wrote Man- Eaters of Kumaon (10 stories) which was first published by Oxford University Press in 1944.Jim Corbett, My Kumaon: Uncollected Writings (India: Oxford University Press, 2012), vii, xv.

A villager by the name of Todal was found dead in the forest on 19 September 1949. The police's theory was that the accused conspired to murder the victim as he was in love with his wife, the defense was that the victim was killed by a man-eating tiger. Thus the defense produced Corbett's book and read passages relating relevant wounds and circumstances of an attack. The accused was later found not guilty.Jim Corbett, My Kumaon: Uncollected Writings (India: Oxford University Press, 2012),137-140. =Film adaptations= In 1946 Universal Pictures brought the rights to the book and made the film Man-Eater of Kumaon (1948). The movie bore no relation to the book and centred on an American played by Wendell Corey who wounds a tiger and is later killed by it. Corbett saw the movie and claimed that the best actor was the tiger.Martin Booth, Carpet Sahib; A Life of Jim Corbett (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 230. In 1986, the BBC produced a docudrama titled Man-Eaters of India with Frederick Treves in the role of Jim Corbett.

The piece was written for and performed by actor and monologist Bransby Williams.Williams, Bransby Bransby Williams by Himself Hutchinson, London (1954) pg 47 It has often been misattributed to Rudyard Kipling, who classed its author as being among his many imitators, and often parodied, most famously by Billy Bennett as The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog.The Green Tie on the little Yellow Dog by Billy Bennett. Accessed 2011-12-10 The opening lines are still very well known: It is set in Nepal (\\"to the north of\\" Kathmandu), and tells the tale of a wild young officer known as \\"Mad Carew\\", who steals the \\"green eye\\" of a \\"yellow god\\" (presumably an emerald in a gold statue) in order to impress his beloved. He is wounded in the course of the robbery, and later murdered, presumably by a devotee of the god for the theft, who returns the jewel to the idol. Hayes's account In his book My Brother Evelyn and Other Profiles, Waugh, Alec (1967) ,'My Brother and Other Profiles', Cassell London Alec Waugh gives Hayes's account of the writing of the poem: Location Bajrayogini Temple Hayes was inaccurate in the conflation of Nepal with India. While Britain achieved colonial control of India between 1858 and 1947, it never did so over Nepal. The political and military agreements between the two countries were therefore quite different. Any British officer in Nepal on official business at the time might have belonged to one of the Gurkha regiments, which recruited from Nepal. However, beyond the statement that \\"he was worshipped in the ranks\\" we are told little about Mad Carew's military background. He may have simply been on cross-border leave from India. In December 2011, the BBC radio programme From Our Own Correspondent broadcasthttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b018ft5h/From_Our_Own_Correspondent_24_12_2011/ a piece by journalist Joanna Jolly in which she detailed a trip she made to Sankhu, a village to the north-east of Kathmandu. On a hill near the village is the Bajrayogini Temple in which there is a gold-plated statue of the Tantric goddess Bajrayogini, who is worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists. In the Newar community the goddess is called Mhasu Khwa Maju (Yellow Faced Mother Goddess). The statue has silver eyes which are only put in during festivals. Although there is no evidence that Hayes ever visited the area, the temple is mentioned in written sources dating back at least 200 years, so it is entirely plausible that he could have heard stories of this statue and the unusual practices regarding its eyes from returning colonial military personnel and wove these elements into his dramatic monologue. References in popular culture Charles Laughton and Vivien Leigh recite this poem in the film Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martins Lane (1938). A Music Hall sketch named \\"Me'em Sahib\\" features a performer trying to recite this, and keeps getting heckled by two British colonial officers sitting in a box seat, who have just returned and \\"update\\" him on the circumstances. In an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs, Mr. Hudson recites the opening lines at a seaside holiday outing by the staff of 165 Eaton Place on the last day of peace before World War I began. In the episode \\"The Fear of Wages\\" of the long-running radio comedy The Goon Show, characters trying to come up with excuses frequently answer along the lines of; \\"Well, it's a long story. You see...\\", and then quoting the opening lines (or variations) of the poem dramatically. In \\"The Shifting Sands\\", Bloodnok distorts it again, with \\"There's a little green-eyed idol to the north of Kathmandu... but the wind blew up the chimney just the same\\". John Lennon uses the opening line in the posthumously released song \\"Nobody Told Me\\" (changing \\"one-eyed\\" to \\"little\\"). In Doctor Who, the Doctor uses the opening lines on regaining consciousness in the 4th Doctor story \\"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\\", although he misattributes them to music hall comic Harry Champion. Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine use part of the opening in their song \\"Perfect Day to Drop the Bomb\\", which starts \\"To the north of Kathmandu there's tiny children sniffing glue\\". The poem is parodied in Series 2 of Danger Mouse in the episode \\"Bad Luck Eye of the Little Yellow God.\\" Tony Randall reads the poem on the episode of The Muppet Show on which he guest stars. In an episode of the BBC sitcom Kiss Me Kate, the character Craig Chapman played by Darren Boyd begins reciting the poem with actions, but is prevented from completing it when Chris Langham's Douglas Cameron character refuses to cooperate. Steptoe and Son actor Harry H. Corbett used this poem as the B-side to his 1963 Pye Records release \\"Like The Big Guys Do\\" In I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again the spoof serial \\"Curse of the Flying Wombat\\" is based on the search for the \\"Green eye of the little yellow dog\\" in Kathmandu. In an episode of Duty Free, the British couples enter a talent contest in their hotel. One of their number attempts to recite the poem to the non- English speaking audience, who mistake his earnest performance for a comedy routine. Their laughter is unappreciated, making him retort: \\"It's not funny! The poor bugger's dead!\\" Biggles and the Little Green God (1969) has Biggles seeking a jade statuette believed by South American Indians to be the god Ata- Hua. The poem is directly referenced at the start of the book and occasionally thereafter. The poem also has a number of references in the 1986 computer game Dizzy - The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure in which various lines of the poem are displayed in banners, where they serve as cryptic clues as to how to solve certain puzzles. In \\"The Adventure of the Six Maledictions\\" by Kim Newman, Mad Carew flees to England with the emerald, pursued by the yellow god's devotees, and turns to the criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty for protection. The story was first published in Gaslight Arcanum, and was subsequently collected with Newman's other Moriarty crossover stories in Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles. In the Masterpiece Theater production of \\"My Mother and Other Strangers,\\" most of the poem is wonderfully performed in Episode 3. In the video game VVVVVV, one of the room titles is \\"Tomb of the Mad Carew.\\" In her autobiographical book, Moving Mountains, Claire Bertschinger mentions having memorized this poem.

The game is in the same style as the Virtua Cop series or The House of the Dead series, with support for one or two players. The game was developed by Sega's Hitmaker development team and first released in 2000. Its plot is of the same vein as James Bond and Mission: Impossible. Despite it also having an arcade release, it never enjoyed the popularity of the Virtua Cop nor The House of the Dead series, which were also produced by Sega. Plot A group of terrorists have stolen the World's Coalition's satellite. The Confidential Mission Force (CMF) sends two of its agents, Howard Gibson and Jean Clifford, to investigate. They first infiltrate a museum, where they find out \\"Agares\\" is behind the plot of stealing the satellite. As soon as they grab the disc with the information, one of the Agares leaders prevent them from getting the disc. After they retrieve the disc, they are sent to a train traveling through the mountains. There, they find out that Agares has kidnapped satellite programmer Irina Mikhailova and forced her to reprogram the satellite. Howard and Jean manage to rescue Irina but are stopped by the General, whom they eventually defeat in a fierce firefight. With the help of Irina, CMF locates Agares Headquarters, where the satellite control is being transported to a submarine. Howard and Jean manage to make it through the base and find the Agares Ringleader, who plans to use the satellite to destroy the CMF's headquarters. After being defeated, the leader uses a self-destruct sequence on Agares's base and escapes in a submarine. If the player succeeds in the final quick time event, the two agents manage to use the satellite to destroy the submarine and deep- six the Ringleader. Howard and Jean then escape, thus saving the rest of the CMF from being destroyed. Gameplay Hitmaker ported this game to the Dreamcast console direct from the arcade. The idea of the mission is to infiltrate enemy headquarters using a combined assortment of weapons and gadgets. Gameplay using a regular Dreamcast controller moving an on-screen cursor is available. Hardware Confidential Mission was developed using the Sega System-16 NAOMI GD-ROM model arcade board. It was available in the arcades in 4 configurations: Cabinet Deluxe, Sitdown, Normal and Upright. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Confidential Mission on their January 15, 2001 issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. Confidential Mission received generally positive to mixed reviews from critics. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 31 out of 40.„Éâ„É™„Éº„É†„Ç≠„É£„Çπ„Éà - „Ç≥„É≥„Éï„Ç£„Éá„É≥„Ç∑„É£„É´ „Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2.

Michel Zevaco (also written as Z√©vaco) (1 February 1860, Ajaccio - 8 August 1918, Eaubonne) was a French journalist, novelist, publisher, film director, and anti-clerical as well as anarchist activist. Michel Zevaco founded the anarchist weekly magazine Gueux (French, Beggars) on 27 March 1892. A month later he was jailed for 6 months and fined for praising Pini and Ravachol. Afterwards he wrote for S√©bastien Faure's journal, Libertaire, as well as for the anarchist newspaper La Renaissance. In 1898, he edited l'Anticl√©rical, for the Anticlerical League of France and was involved in supporting Alfred Dreyfus during the eponymous Dreyfus Affair. Zevaco's famous cloak and dagger novels, Les Pardaillan, began to be serialized in the daily newspapers in 1900 to great popular success. Yet he is today quite unknown, in spite of the new interest aroused by popular literature. A former school teacher, then an officer, he became a militant journalist, who wrote for various revolutionary newspapers, of anarchist tendency. He became famous mainly for the part he played in the anti-clerical struggles at the end of the 19th century. Then, as a writer of serial novels, he published works which had a great success in Jean Jaur√®s' daily La Petite R√©publique, and he became appointed serial writer for Le Matin from 1906 to his death. His already well- established popularity was made even greater by his promising beginnings as a film-director in 1917. His novels first published by Fayard and Tallandier were republished several times and adapted for the screen; the latest paperback edition only gives a mutilated version, and is impaired by many cuts. He is remembered as the author of Les Pardaillan, Le Capitan, Le Pont des soupirs (Bridge of Sighs), Borgia, Buridan, L'H√©ro√Øne, l'H√¥tel Saint Pol and Nostradamus, his most famous historical novels, but also published novels related to his times. Some of his serials have not yet been published. Zevaco's novels, including the Les Pardaillan series, were translated into Persian as part of the great interest in historical novels in Iran. The publisher was Gutenberg Publishers, a joint project of the famous Soviet Mir Publishing House and an Iranian publisher. Following the success of the translations of the novels of Alexandre Dumas in Iran, many translators sought similar novels to translate. Among these were Zabihollah Mansouri and Manuchehr Motiei, the latter even attempting to write similar novels set in an Iranian environment. Among the novels translated were the Les Pardaillan, Fausta the Female Pope, Nostradamus, Buridan, and many other works of Zevaco. In Persian, due to a mistake, his name sometimes is written as Z-W-A-G-O which can be read as Zewago or Zouago and has caused problems. leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has also read some novels of Zevaco and recommended them to the youths : > I do not want to introduce too many books and novels to the youths, but I > may name some authors. For instance, there is a well-known French author > called Michel Zevaco who has written many books. I have read most of his > novels in the past. In the 1960s, many of Zevaco's historical novels were translated to Hebrew and published with considerable success by the M. Mizrahi (◊û. ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô) publishing house in Tel Aviv ◊û. ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô. The 1963 translation of Le Capitan was by Yehoshua Kenaz, a well-known Israeli writer.Mentioned in the online list of Kenaz works However, these Hebrew translations are long out of print, and Zevaco is virtually unknown to later generations of Hebrew readers. Zevaco is well known in Turkey; his most important books have been translated and published in Turkish. Borgia was translated in 1909 into Ottoman language, and printed by Hilal Matbaasƒ±. The Les Pardaillan series have appeared in many different editions, printed by ≈ûems Matbaasƒ± in 1910s, by ƒ∞NKILAP VE AKA in 1940s, by G√úVEN BASIM VE YAYINEVƒ∞ in 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, by Baskan and Olu≈ü in 1970s.

It is named in honor of Lala Lajpat Rai, also known the Lion of Punjab, and is today most known for the Lajpat Nagar Central Market. Situated Close to Sector 16A Noida U.P the area has traffic in office hours.This area is not to be confused with the Lajpat Nagar in Ghaziabad in the NCR region. Overview Delhi areas The area is divided into four parts: Lajpat Nagar I, II, III (north of the Ring Road) and IV (south of the Ring Road). Housing colonies like Amar Colony, Dayanand Colony, Double Storey (also known as Nirmal Puri), National Park and Vikram Vihar are also located in it. Lajpat Nagar is famous for its Central Market, a popular shopping destination, and also is known for the garments and textiles which are sold there. The area falls partially under the Kasturba Nagar Constituency and part of it is in the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. History Lajpat Nagar was developed in the 1950s and most of its early residents were Hindus and Sikhs moving east from newly formed Pakistan following the partition of India in 1947. As such, many of these individuals are Multanis and Sindhis.. One part of Lajpat Nagar IV (Dayanand Colony) was named after Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati, by Mr. B.N. Puri in 1957. Initially, refugee camps were set up in Purana Quila, and refugees were allotted plots in areas like Lajpat Nagar, Patel Nagar, Rajendra Nagar. The plots were of 15x60 feet constructed like army barracks. The houses were all single story, with asbestos roofs, in the beginning, but now most of the houses are multi-storeyed in this neighborhood. The colony also housed a refugee camp for Bengali widows, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, known as Kasturba Ashram. In 1960, Servants of the People Society (founded by Lala Lajpat Rai in 1921 in Lahore) after functioning for many years since Partition of India, shifted from the residence of MP Lala Achint Ram to a new building known as Lajpat Bhawan. In the recent years, Lajpat Nagar has become a preferred residential neighborhood for tourists and certain refugees from various countries, including Afghanistan, who often travel to New Delhi as medical tourists, owing to the presence of affordable quality health care in the capital. It is common to see individuals from different parts of India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and many African countries in this neighborhood. Accessibility Lajpat Nagar is well connected by Delhi Transport Corporation bus services and the Delhi Mass Rapid Transit System. Route number 543 connects Anand Vihar in East Delhi to Lajpat Nagar, and Teevr Mudrika connects Lajpat Nagar to Rohini in North Delhi and Punjabi Bagh in West Delhi. The Lajpat Nagar Station of the Delhi Metro has elevated platforms lying on Delhi Metro‚Äôs Violet Line and underground platforms on Delhi Metro's Pink Line. The station was opened to the public in 2010 along with the first section of the Violet Line. A new underpass connection has been opened in 2014 below Defence Colony-Lajpat Nagar flyover between Lajpat Nagar and Jangpura for easy access to areas like Jangpura Extension, Bhogal, and Nizamuddin. The area is also connected to the Delhi Suburban Railway with the Lajpat Nagar railway station * Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) is 23 km from Lajpat Nagar. * 15 minutes from Central Secretariat (Delhi Metro) station via the Delhi Metro * 5 Minutes from Kalkaji via Nehru Place station Delhi Metro * 15 minutes from Sarita Vihar (Delhi Metro) station via the Delhi Metro * 15 minutes from Nizamuddin Railway Station * 35 minutes from New Delhi Railway Station * 10 minutes from the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium * 25 minutes from Connaught Place via Rajiv Chowk station Delhi Metro. * 10 minutes from Kalka Mandir metro station via Delhi Metro.

Ubayd Allah is primarily remembered for his role in the killings of members of Ali ibn Abi Talib's family including Husayn ibn Ali, and he has become infamous in Muslim tradition. He virtually inherited the governorships from his father Ziyad ibn Abihi after the latter's death in 673. During Ubayd Allah's governorship, he suppressed Kharijite and Alid revolts. In the ensuing Battle of Karbala in 680, Husayn and his small retinue were slain by Ubayd Allah's troops, shocking many in the Muslim community. Ubayd Allah was ultimately evicted from Iraq by the Arab tribal nobility amid the revolt of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. He made it to Syria where he persuaded Marwan I to seek the caliphate and helped galvanize support for the flailing Umayyads. Afterward, he fought at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684 against pro-Zubayrid tribes and helped reconstitute the Umayyad army. With this army he struggled against rebel Qaysi tribe in the Jazira before advancing against the Alids and Zubayrids of Iraq. However, he was slain and his forces routed at the Battle of Khazir by Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar, the commander of the pro-Alid al-Mukhtar of Kufa. Origins Ubayd Allah was the son of Ziyad ibn Abihi whose tribal origins were obscure; Ziyad was born out of wedlock and his father was not known, while his mother was a Persian concubine named Murjanah.Robinson, p. 763. Ziyad served as the Umayyad governor of Iraq and the lands east of that province, collectively known as Khurasan, during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661‚Äì680).Hasson 2002, p. 519. Governor of Iraq and Khurasan Umayyad Caliphate coin imitating Sasanid Empire ruler Khosrau II. Coin of the time of Mu'awiya I ibn Abi Sufyan. BCRA (Basra) mint; \\"Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, governor\\". Dated AH 56 = 675/6 CE. Sasanian style bust imitating Khosrau II right; bismillah and three pellets in margin; c/m: winged creature right / Fire altar with ribbons and attendants; star and crescent flanking flames; date to left, mint name to right. Ubayd Allah's father prepared Ziyad to succeed him as governor, and indeed, after Ziyad's death in 672/673, Ubayd Allah became governor of Khurasan. A year or two later, he was also appointed to the governorship of Basra. According to historian Hugh N. Kennedy, Ubayd Allah was \\"more hasty and given to the use of force than his father, but a man whose devotion to the Umayyad cause could not have been doubted\\".Kennedy 2004, p. 74. In 674 he crossed the Amu Darya and defeated the forces of the ruler of Bukhara in the first known invasion of the city by Muslim Arabs.Gibb 2007, pp. 17‚Äì19. From at least 674 and 675, Ubayd Allah had coins struck in his name in Khurasan and Basra, respectively. They were based on Sasanian coinage and written in Pahlavi script. The mints were located in Basra, Darabjird, Maysan, Narmashir, Jayy and, to a lesser extent, Kufa. The latter was attached to Ubayd Allah's governorship in 679/680, giving him full control of Iraq. =Suppression of the Shia of Ali= Mu'awiya died in 680 and was succeeded by his son Yazid I. Mu'awiya's designation of his son was an unprecedented act and shocked many in the Muslim community, particularly the Arab nobility of Kufa.Kennedy 2004, p. 77. They long sympathized with Caliph Ali, Mu'awiya's former rival, and Ali's family. One of Ali's sons, Husayn dispatched his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to Kufa to set the stage for Husayn's accession to the caliphate.Donner 2010, p. 178.Wellhausen 1927, pp. 146‚Äì147. Ibn Aqil garnered significant support and was hosted by a prominent pro-Alid nobleman. Ubayd Allah became aware of Ibn Aqil's activities, prompting the latter to launch a premature assault against the governor. Ubayd Allah was holed up in his palace, but thirty men from his shurta (security forces) fended off Ibn Aqil's partisans, allowing Ubayd Allah to escape.Kennedy 2001, p. 13. He then persuaded many Kufan noblemen to back him against Ibn Aqil, who was abandoned by his supporters and slain on 10 September 680.Crone 1980, p. 32. Husayn had already been en route to Kufa from Medina when he received news of Ibn Aqil's execution. Ubayd Allah was prepared for Husayn's arrival and sent troops to intercept him. They prevented Husayn and his small retinue from reaching the watered areas of the province. The two sides negotiated for weeks, but Ubayd Allah refused Husayn entry into Kufa while Husayn refused to recognize Yazid's caliphate or return to Arabia. In the end, a short battle was fought at Karbala on 10 October 680, in which Husayn and nearly all of his partisans were slain. Husayn had never received the expected backing of his Kufan sympathizers, but the latter's resentment festered as a result of his death. The slaying of Husayn, a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, perturbed many Muslims. Role in Umayyad succession The death of Yazid in 683 led to a major leadership crisis in the caliphate, and \\"the power of his house seemed to collapse everywhere\\", in the words of Orientalist Julius Wellhausen.Wellhausen 1927, p. 169. Ubayd Allah initially neglected to support Yazid's son and designated successor, Mu'awiya II and secured oaths of allegiance to himself from the Basran Arab nobility. In a speech addressed to them, he emphasized his connection to Basra and promised to maintain the wealth of the city's inhabitants.Kennedy 2004, p. 78. Nonetheless, the Basrans turned against him, forcing him to abandon his palace.Madelung 1981, p. 301. He was replaced by Abd Allah ibn al-Harith, a member of the Banu Hashim. Ubayd Allah took refuge with the Azdi chieftain Mas'ud ibn Amr in late 683 or early 684. He plotted to restore his governorship by encouraging Mas'ud to form an alliance of the Yamani and Rabi'a tribes against his opponents from the Banu Tamim and Ibn al-Harith.Madelung 1981, p. 303. Mas'ud took to the pulpit of Basra's mosque to stir up the revolt, but Tamimi tribesmen, under Ibn al- Harith's direction, stormed the building and killed Mas'ud. After Mas'ud's death, Ubayd Allah fled the city practically alone in March 684, taking the Syrian desert route to Hawran or Palmyra.Wellhausen 1927, p. 175. In his rush to escape, he left his wife and family behind. When Ubayd Allah arrived in Syria, he found it in political disarray; Caliph Mu'awiya II had died weeks into his rule and a power vacuum ensued with many Syrian noblemen, particularly from the Qaysi tribes, switching allegiance to the rival, Mecca- based caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The latter had expelled the Umayyads from the Hejaz and among the exiles to Syria was Marwan ibn al-Hakam, an Umayyad elder.Kennedy 2004, pp. 78‚Äì79. Ubayd Allah persuaded Marwan, who was preparing to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr's sovereignty, to enter his candidacy as Mu'awiya II's successor.Kennedy 2004, p. 79. The Umayyads' principal Syrian allies, the Banu Kalb, had sought to maintain Umayyad rule and nominated Mu'awiya II's half-brother Khalid as caliph. However, the other pro-Umayyad Syrian tribes viewed Khalid as too young and inexperienced, and rallied around Marwan, who was ultimately chosen as caliph. Military campaigns in Syria and Jazira Ubayd Allah fought for Marwan and his tribal allies against the Qaysi tribes led by al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, the governor of Damascus, at the Battle of Marj Rahit in August 684. The Qays were routed and al-Dahhak killed. Ubayd Allah was put in command of Marwan's army which, during Marj Rahit, consisted 6,000 men from a handful of loyalist tribes.Kennedy 2001, p. 32. According to Kennedy, Ubayd Allah \\"clearly intended to rebuild the Syrian army which had served Mu'awiya and Yazid I so well\\". In the aftermath of Marj Rahit, Ubayd Allah oversaw campaigns against rebel Qaysi tribes for Marwan and his son and successor Abd al-Malik (r. 685‚Äì705) in the Jazira. However, Marwan's forces were too little to assert Umayyad rule throughout the caliphate. Thus, Ubayd Allah expanded recruitment to include various Qaysi tribes. He placed Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni of Kindah as his second-in- command, and Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l-Kila' of Himyar, Adham ibn Muhriz of Bahila, al-Rabi'a ibn Mukhariq of Banu Ghani and Jabala ibn Abd Allah of Khath'am as deputy commanders. Other than Husayn ibn Numayr, all the other commanders were either Qaysi or had earlier supported al-Dahhak against Marwan. In January 685, as Ubayd Allah was in Manbij preparing for the Umayyad reconquest of Iraq, Husayn ibn Numayr defeated the pro-Alid Penitents at the Battle of Ayn al-Warda.Wellhausen 1927, p. 185. Ubayd Allah had been promised by Marwan the governorship over all of the lands he could conquer from the Alids and Ibn al- Zubayr, and he may have been sanctioned to plunder Kufa. For the following year, Ubayd Allah was bogged down in battles with the Qaysi tribes of Jazira led by Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi. By 686, Ubayd Allah's army numbered some 60,000 troops. By the time Ubayd Allah's army approached Mosul toward Iraq, the Zubayrids under Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr had established themselves in Basra while al-Mukhtar ibn Ubayd took control of Kufa in the name of the Alid Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya.Kennedy 2004, p. 81. Al-Mukhtar dispatched Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar and an army composed largely of non-Arab freedmen to confront Ubayd Allah. The latter fended off the first wave of al-Mukhtar's troops, and proceeded to face off Ibn al-Ashtar at the Khazir River. In the ensuing Battle of Khazir, the Umayyad army was routed and Ubayd Allah was slain by Ibn al- Ashtar. His commanders Husayn, Shurahbil and al-Rabi'a were also killed. With Ubayd Allah's death, Caliph Abd al-Malik halted further advances against Iraq until 691. Death At the Battle of Khazir, Ubayd was eventually decapitated, and his severed head was brought to a royal gathering of the people of al- Mukhtar. On seeing the decapitated head, people started screaming in terror, for a snake suddenly appeared and entered the skull of Ubayd, entering through the nostril and resided inside for a while. It exited and then did the same thing twice more.(Sunan-ut-Tirmidhi, vol. 5, pp. 431, Hadeeth 3805) See also *Hani ibn Urwa *Shemr ibn Thul-Jawshan References Bibliography    * External links *Umayyad Governors of al-Basra and al- Kufa *Muhammad and Islamic Conquest Category:686 deaths Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Generals of the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Umayyad governors of Iraq Category:Umayyad governors of Khurasan Category:Medieval Arabs killed in battle Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People of the Second Fitna Category:Banu Thaqif Category:Umayyad governors of Basra Category:7th-century Umayyad people ","title":"Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad"},{"id":"2163346","text":"M protein may refer to: * M protein (Streptococcus), a virulence factor of the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes * Another name for viral matrix protein, non structural protein linking the viral envelope with the virus capsid * Myeloma protein, also called paraprotein, an abnormal protein in the urine or blood, often seen in multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance * MYOM2 (Myomesin-2), a protein composing the M-line of muscle cell sarcomeres * Protein M in Mycoplasma genitalium which is different from the above-mentioned M protein ","title":"M protein"},{"id":"2163351","text":"Abu al-Mughira Ziyad ibn Abihi (; ‚Äì 673), also known as Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan (), was an administrator and statesman of the successive Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates in the mid-7th century. He served as the governor of Basra in 665‚Äì670 and ultimately the first governor of Iraq and virtual viceroy of the eastern Caliphate between 670 and his death. Ziyad's parentage is obscure, but he was raised among the Banu Thaqif in Ta'if and arrived with his adoptive tribesmen in Basra upon its foundation in 636 as the Muslim Arabs' springboard for the conquest of the Sasanian Empire. He was initially employed by the city's first governor, Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini, and was kept on as a scribe or secretary by his successors. Caliph Ali () appointed Ziyad to Fars to suppress a local rebellion and he maintained his loyalty to Ali's caliphate after the latter's assassination in 661 and the subsequent rule of Ali's enemy, Mu'awiya I (). The latter ultimately overcame Ziyad's opposition, formally recognized him as his own paternal half-brother and appointed him governor of Basra. Ziyad's inaugural speech, in which he announced his carrot- and-stick policies to the city's turbulent population, is celebrated in Arab history for its eloquence. After the death of Kufa's governor, Ziyad's mentor al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, Mu'awiya made Ziyad the first governor of a unified Iraqi province. He administratively reorganized the garrison cities and minted Sasanian-style silver dirhams in his own name. He firmly established Arab power and recommenced conquests in the Caliphate's easternmost province of Khurasan by relocating there 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Iraq and dispatching expeditionary forces against Tukharistan, Balkh and Quhistan. Though the mass resettlement improved Iraq's economic and political conditions by siphoning off Arab tribal soldiers from the overcrowded garrisons and creating new opportunities for war spoils, the move had major ramifications for the Caliphate as the descendants of these Khurasani Arab troops formed the army that toppled the Umayyads in 750. Ziyad died near Kufa in 673, but his sons Ubayd Allah, Abd al-Rahman, Salm, Abbad and Yazid went on to hold posts as governors or deputy governors of Iraq, Khurasan and Sijistan. Ziyad was the subject of early Arabic biographies and is remembered in Arab history as one of the four great wise men of his era and as a highly skilled administrator and orator. His administration in Iraq served as a model for his successors. Origins Ziyad was likely born in Ta'if in 622 or 623/24. His precise parentage is obscure, hence his frequent name in the sources as ZiyƒÅd ibn Abƒ´hi (\\"Ziyad son of his father\\"). He was the illegitimate son of a certain Sumayya, his father being unknown. The origins of Sumayya are also obscure. The 9th-century historians al-Baladhuri and Awana ibn al-Hakam both relate that she had been a slave living in Kashkar, though the former asserts she belonged to a member of the Banu Yashkur, a branch of the Arab tribe of Banu Bakr, and the latter states she belonged to a Persian dehqan (landowning magnate). In the narrative of al-Baladhuri, Sumayya's Yashkuri owner embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca seeking to cure his illness and was subsequently treated in Ta'if by al-Harith ibn Kalada, a physician from the Thaqif clan resident in the city; as a reward for his services, Ibn Kalada was gifted Sumayya. In Awana's narrative, Sumayya was given to Ibn Kalada by the Persian dehqan after he treated him. In any case, she was ultimately given to Ubayd, a Greek or Syrian slave belonging to Ibn Kalada's wife. Though Ziyad alludes to his Persian origin in a poem, his family claimed that Sumayya was not a slave, but the daughter of a certain al-A'war from the Zayd Manat clan of the Arab tribe of Banu Tamim. Early career in Basra A creek in Basra in the early 20th century. Ziyad began his career in Basra in 636 and served as its governor between 665 and his death in 673 During the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr (), Ziyad embraced Islam, which \\"opened the world to him\\", according to historian Julius Wellhausen. He later became one of the first settlers of the Arab garrison town of Basra. Before the city's founding in 638, the Muslim troops fighting on the Iraqi front used as their military camp the ruined Persian village on the site. Ziyad arrived there with the sons of Ibn Kalada, Nafi and Abu Bakra Nufay. The latter's family gained preeminence in the city, having acquired large landholdings there. Abu Bakra's brother-in-law Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini had established the initial camp at Basra in 635 and was the founder and first governor of the city. The administrative skills of Ziyad became apparent from the time of his adolescence and Utba charged him with minor tasks in the Basran dƒ´wƒÅn (bureaucracy) during the reign of Caliph Umar (). In 635, Utba tasked him with distributing to the Arab troops the war spoils from the capture of al-Ubulla (Apologos), a town immediately east of Basra. According to the modern historian Isaac Hasson, Ziyad \\"distinguished himself as an intelligent and open-minded secretary, who was devoted to his master and to public service ... he showed an unusual aptitude for accounting and had an excellent command of epistolary art\\". His skills and his assignment by Basra's military governor Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as his acting replacement while he was on a military campaign gained the attention of Caliph Umar. He brought Ziyad to Medina, the center of the nascent Muslim state, where he further tested his skills; Ziyad's performance earned him a reward of 1,000 silver dirhams by Umar, which he used to purchase the freedom of his mother or his stepfather Ubayd. Soon after his return to Basra, Ziyad was made Utba's kƒÅtib (scribe or secretary). After Utba's death, Ziyad continued his service as kƒÅtib under his successors Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, a member of the Thaqif who became Ziyad's mentor. When al-Mughira was recalled by Umar to Medina in 638 due to charges of adultery by three accusers, including Abu Bakra Nufay and a certain Shibl ibn Ma'bad al-Bajali, both of whom were Ziyad's maternal half-brothers, Ziyad was also recalled to give his own testimony. His statement was partial toward al-Mughira and as a result, the charges were dismissed and the accusers were flogged. During the reign of Caliph Uthman (), Ziyad served the caliph's appointee to Basra, Abd Allah ibn Amir. Uthman's successor Ali () appointed Abd Allah ibn Abbas governor of Basra and entrusted Ziyad with collection of the province's kharƒÅj (land tax) and supervision of the treasury. According to Hasson, \\"Ali's appreciation of Ziyad's talents were so great\\" that he mandated Ibn Abbas heed Ziyad's counsel. When Ibn Abbas left Basra in 657 to accompany Ali at the Battle of Siffin against the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, he left Ziyad as his acting governor. During this period, he stamped out an uprising by the Banu Tamim, a major military tribal faction in the city, with critical assistance from another Basran faction, the Azd. After Ali returned from Siffin, his appointee to the district of Fars, Sahl ibn Hunayf, was ousted by its inhabitants, after which he dispatched Ziyad. The people of Fars were satisfied with Ziyad's leadership and he was able to collect the district's kharƒÅj. He remained in Fars through the remainder of Ali's rule, which ended with the caliph's assassination in 661 and the foundation of the Umayyad Caliphate under Mu'awiya. Afterward, he remained headquartered in a fortress in the vicinity of Istakhr. Of Ali's appointees, he held out the longest from recognizing Mu'awiya's caliphate. Mu'awiya's agent, Busr ibn Abi Artat, pressured Ziyad by capturing and threatening to kill three of his sons in Basra. Ziyad's half-brother Abu Bakra interceded with Mu'awiya and Ziyad's sons were released. He finally surrendered to Mu'awiya's rule in 662/63 after the intercession of al-Mughira, who Mu'awiya had appointed governor of Kufa, the other main Arab garrison town of Iraq. In the deal reached, the revenues from Fars owed to the caliphal treasury were split between Ziyad and al- Mughira, which Mu'awiya ignored. Ziyad moved to Kufa and maintained intimate ties with al-Mughira and his family. Governor of Basra Map of medieval Basra, showing Ziyad's divisions of the city into fifths along Arab tribal factional lines: Abd al-Qays, Tamim, Ahl al-Aliya, Bakr and Azd Mu'awiya formally recognized Ziyad as a son of his father Abu Sufyan. The motion was initiated when Ziyad sought clarification from the caliph about rumors of Abu Sufyan's biological paternity. According to Wellhausen, Mu'awiya summoned Ziyad to Damascus and recognized him as his paternal half-brother, \\"so as to bind him in this way absolutely to himself and to his family\\". The decision was seen as scandalous by the Umayyad ruling family. Mu'awiya's son Yazid and members from other branches of the clan, namely the extended family of Marwan ibn al-Hakam in Medina and Abd Allah ibn Amir, the governor of Basra, protested or threatened action against the decision. Ibn Amir and the Marwanids were silenced as a result of threats of force or bribes. Yazid's relations with Ziyad remained strained and satirical poetic verses about the event were spread by Marwan's brother Abd al-Rahman. Muslim scholars generally viewed the episode as one of Mu'awiya's most disreputable actions. Realizing that Ziyad \\"had both the abilities and the all-important local connections to be his right-hand man in Basra\\", Mu'awiya appointed him governor of the province, according to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy. He entered office in June or July 665, issuing an inaugural carrot-and-stick speech to Basra's restless population. According to Hasson it was \\"considered a masterpiece of eloquence\\". Wellhausen describes it as \\"celebrated\\" and the one which was called a \\"[speech] without a preface\\" because it skipped the traditional introductions praising God and blessing the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The speech is translated as follows: > Ye are putting relationship before religion, ye are excusing and sheltering > your criminals, and tearing down the protecting laws sanctified by Islam. > Beware of prowling by night; I will kill every one who is found at night in > the streets. Beware of the arbitrary summons of relationship; I will cut out > the tongue of every one who raises the cry. Whoever pushes anyone into the > water, whoever sets fire to another's house, whoever breaks into a house, > whoever opens a grave, him will I punish for it. I make every family > responsible for those belonging to it. Hatred towards myself I do not > punish, but only crime. Many who are terrified at my coming will be glad of > my presence, and many who are building their hopes upon it will be > undeceived. I rule you with the authority of God and care for your > maintenance out of the wealth of God. From you I demand obedience, and ye > can demand from me justice. In whatsoever I fall short, three things there > are in which I shall not be lacking: at any time I shall be ready to listen > to anyone; I shall pay you your pension at the proper time, and I shall not > send you to war too far away or keep you in the field overlong. Do not let > yourselves be carried away by your hatred and wrath against me ; it would go > ill with you if ye did. Many heads do I see tottering; let each man see to > it that his own remains on his shoulders! A number of punitive measures along the lines of those cited in his speech were taken by Ziyad at the start of his term and largely gained for him the Basrans' respect. He established unprecedented levels of security in the city, its Iranian dependencies to the east, i.e. Fars and Kerman, and the Arabian Desert to the south. The Kharijites of Basra, many of whom were concerned more with banditry than politics, submitted to his authority. Under Ziyad, Basra began to take shape as a proper Islamic city. His rule saw the crude mud bricks of the city's homes replaced by more durable baked bricks and he built a congregational mosque and residential palace. In the words of the historian Charles Pellat, Ziyad, \\"to a certain degree, [may] be considered as the artisan of the town's prosperity\\". His effective rule cemented Mu'awiya's confidence in him. In the same year that Ziyad was appointed to Basra, the province of Bahrayn (eastern Arabia) and its dependency, the Yamama (central Arabia), were attached to Ziyad's governorship. Viceroy of Iraq and the east After the death of al-Mughira in 670, Kufa and its dependencies were attached to Ziyad's governorship, making him the practical viceroy over Iraq and the eastern half of the Caliphate. He was the first to serve as the dual governor of Kufa and Basra and divided his residence between the two towns. In the winter he stayed in Basra and left Amr ibn Hurayth as his deputy in Kufa, while he resided in Kufa in the summer, leaving Samura ibn Jundab as his deputy in Basra. His strong grip in Kufa marked a shift from al-Mughira's hands-off approach. A source of disturbance for him in Kufa was the agitation of the Alids, partisans of Caliph Ali, led by Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi, who disapproved of Umayyad rule and led the first open calls for the caliphate to be held by Ali's progeny. Though al-Mughira tolerated Hujr, Ziyad issued a number of dire warnings to cease his open dissent. He succeeded in turning most of Hujr's supporters among the Kufan troops against him. In 671, he had Hujr and thirteen of his loyalists arrested and sent to Damascus for punishment, where six, including Hujr, were executed in Adra for their refusal to renounce support for the Alids. One of the men, Abd al-Rahman ibn Hassan al-Anazi, who was spared by Mu'awiya later insulted the caliph after refusing his invocation to condemn Ali and was sent back to Ziyad, who had him buried alive as punishment. To end the chaos in the am·π£ar (garrisons) of Basra and Kufa, Ziyad administratively reformed the two towns. From the reign of Caliph Umar, their garrisons consisted of soldiers from different tribes who were grouped together for the distribution of military stipends. There were seven such tribal groups in Kufa and Basra and at the head of each group was a chieftain chosen by its members who served as their representative to the government. Gradually, this system had become economically inefficient and politically turbulent. There was no control on Arab immigration into the am·π£ar, resulting in overpopulation and in turn, increased competition over fewer resources. Ziyad thus resolved to form larger divisions by unifying related clans and personally appointing their leader, which resulted in Kufa's reorganization into quarters and Basra into fifths. This measure enabled easier control of the two towns' inhabitants. Ziyad undertook further reforms in Kufa and Basra, including regularizing the timely payment of stipends, embarking on agricultural development schemes, including canal digging, and minting Sasanian-style dirhams that bore his name as \\"Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan\\". =Consolidation of Khurasan= Map of early medieval Central Asia with Khurasan, where Ziyad settled 50,000 Arab troops and their families, and Balkh and Tukharistan, where Ziyad's general led expeditions Ziyad's authority extended to Khurasan and Sijistan, the far eastern regions of the Caliphate which were considered dependencies of the Basra garrison. The Arab conquests of these areas in the 640s and 650s were akin to raids and did not firmly establish the Caliphate's power. Moreover, the political instability of the final years of Uthman's caliphate and the First Muslim Civil War saw local revolts which further weakened Arab authority. In 655, the Sasanian prince Peroz III, backed by the army of Tukharistan, attempted to reassert Persian power. Under previous caliphs, the vast region had been experimentally divided into separate provinces under the leadership of Arab tribal chiefs. Governance was largely left to local princes. Fearing a Persian resurgence, which a fragmentary division of Khurasan could afford, Ziyad centralized the administration of the province in the small Arab garrison at Merv. To relieve Basra's fiscal pressures, Ziyad recommenced the Muslim conquests in Central Asia. He organized the Arab military presence in Khurasan. In 667, he dispatched an army to the region under his lieutenant general al-Hakam ibn Amr al-Ghifari. The latter conquered lower Tukharistan and Gharchistan and temporarily crossed the Oxus river into Transoxiana, forcing Peroz to withdraw into Tang China. Meanwhile, Ziyad's removal of dead soldiers and input of new recruits to the Iraqi army registers led to numerous tribesmen being taken off the payrolls. He dispatched 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Basra and Kufa to permanently settle in the Merv oasis of Khurasan. The resettlement of these troops may have been a means \\"to defuse possibly dangerous developments\\" relating to the Arab tribal influx in the two garrison towns, according to the historian Gerald Hawting. As a result, the Merv oasis became home to the largest concentration of Muslims outside of the Fertile Crescent. Al-Hakam's successor, Ghalib ibn Abd Allah al-Laythi, was less successful in subduing Tukharistan and Ziyad sent another of his lieutenants, Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi, to stamp out the revolts in the conquered areas in 670/71. Rabi proceeded to secure the capitulation of Balkh, whose inhabitants had revolted against Arab rule, in a treaty and then destroyed the army of the Hepthalite princes in Quhistan. In 673, Rabi's son Abd Allah extended Arab rule to the western banks of the Oxus and established tributary agreements with the fortress towns of Amul and Zamm. To solidify the territorial gains and supply the manpower for further conquests Ziyad intended for the Arab troops, initially concentrated in the Merv oasis, to colonize other parts of Khurasan. They were ultimately distributed between five regional garrisons under Ziyad's successors. Legacy and assessment Ziyad died in the village of al-Thawiyya near Kufa on 23 August 673. He was buried in a cemetery there that contained the graves of several Qurayshites and left an inheritance of 10,000 silver dirhams. During his governorship of Kufa in 675‚Äì678, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al- Fihri visited Ziyad's grave and recited an elegy: > If nobility and Islam ever immortalized a human being, > They would certainly immortalize you. A year after his death, Mu'awiya appointed Ziyad's son Ubayd Allah as governor of Khurasan and then Basra. Under Mu'awiya's son and successor, Caliph Yazid I (), the governorship of Kufa was also handed to Ubayd Allah. Ziyad's sons Abd al-Rahman and Salm served successively as governors of Khurasan in 678‚Äì680 and 680‚Äì683/84, and two other sons, Abbad and Yazid, served successively as governors of Sijistan in 673‚Äì680/81 and 680/81. The Thaqif, which had maintained close ties with the Umayyads since the pre-Islamic era and played an integral role in the Muslim conquest of Iraq, provided the Umayyad dynasty with a series of viceroys in Iraq, including al-Mughira, Ziyad, Ubayd Allah and al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (), and the Muslim traditional sources devote more attention to them than the caliphs on whose behalf they ruled. Along with his mentor al-Mughira, Ziyad and his family were part of what \\"some must have seen as a Thaqafi mafia\\" controlling Iraq and the east, according to Kennedy. Among \\"the most gifted governors of the Umayyad era\\", Ziyad \\"had a good understanding of his task as governor, and had a great influence on his successors concerning the conception of the duties of rulers\\", according to Hasson. According to Kennedy, Ziyad's settlement of Iraqi Arab troops in Khurasan had \\"extremely important consequences for Islamic history\\" as the descendants of those settlers, who were known as ahl KhurƒÅsƒÅn, ultimately destroyed the Umayyad Caliphate as part of the Abbasid army in 750. The execution of Hujr and his six partisans, all of whom had been prominent men in their own right, also led to deep-seated resentment among their Kufan kinsmen. The incident would serve as a harbinger for future pro-Alid risings. The death of Hujr represented the first political execution in Islamic history, and he and his companions are viewed as martyrs by Shia Muslims. Ziyad was alleged to have ordered cruel acts against some Alid partisans, including crucifixions. Interest in Ziyad's biography emerged early on among the traditional Muslim historians, with works written about him by Abu Mikhnaf (d. 774), Hisham ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819) and Abd al-Aziz ibn Yahya al-Jaludi (d. 943). He is considered a highly skilled orator among Arabs, with his inaugural speech and fragments of other speeches and sayings cited in Islamic literature and Arabic rhetoric, polemics and histories. He is counted alongside Mu'awiya, al-Mughira and Amr ibn al-As, the conqueror and governor of Egypt, as one of the four duhƒÅt (i.e. \\"shrewds\\") among the Arab statesmen of his era. According to the medieval Syrian historian Ibn Asakir (d. 1176), Ziyad had expert knowledge of the Qur'an, its tenets and Islamic jurisprudence. A medieval Basran historian, Muhammad ibn Imran al-Abdi, related that Ziyad respected and enjoyed listening to the hadiths about Umar and proclaimed about them: \\"This is the truth we hear! This is the sunna!\\" Ziyad is credited by a number of sources for transmitting sayings by the Islamic prophet Muhammad through Umar as the original transmitter. In 777 the Abbasid authorities stripped Ziyad's descendants of their status as official members of the Quraysh (the tribe to which the Umayyads and Abbasids belonged) in the dƒ´wƒÅn rolls, which entitled them to relatively high pensions, and declared them part of Thaqif, whose members were paid less. At some point afterward, they were reinstated as Quraysh as a result of bribing government officials. Family Ziyad had numerous wives and ummahat awlad (slave women who bore children; sing. umm walad). He had twenty sons and twenty-three daughters, most of whom were the children of ummahat awlad. From his first wife Mu'adha bint Sakhr of the Banu Uqayl tribe Ziyad had four sons, including Muhammad and Abd al-Rahman, who respectively married daughters of Caliph Mu'awiya I and the latter's brother Utba. His other Arab wives were Lubaba bint Awf al-Harashiyya, the daughter of a Basran noble, whose brother Zurara was a prominent Muslim jurist and one- time qadi (Islamic head judge) of Basra on Ziyad's behalf; an unnamed daughter of al-Qa'qa ibn Ma'bad ibn Zurara, a chieftain of the Darim clan of the Banu Tamim tribe who was credited for leading his tribe's first delegation to the Islamic prophet Muhammad; an unnamed daughter of Muhajir ibn Hakim ibn Taliq ibn Sufyan, a fifth-generation descendant of the Umayyad clan's progenitor Umayya ibn Abd Shams; and an unnamed woman from the Khuza'a tribe. Ziyad was also married for a time to a Sasanian Persian princess, Marjana (or Manjana), who mothered his son Ubayd Allah; she later remarried a Persian commander of Ziyad called Shiruyah al-Uswari. Ziyad's daughter Ramla was a wife of the Umayyad prince Umayya, son of Ziyad's deputy governor of Fars province or its Ardashir-Khurrah district and later his deputy governor of Kufa, Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, who led Ziyad's funeral prayers and served as Kufa's governor until 675. Ziyad had successively appointed Umayya as the deputy governor of Khuzistan and al-Ubulla. Ziyad's daughter Sakhra was married to a noble of the Qurayshite Makhzum clan, Ubaydallah ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith, a great- grandson of Hisham ibn al-Mughira.

Mumbo Jumbo has remained in print for 45 years, since its first edition, and has been published in French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and British editions, with a Chinese translation currently in production.\\"Complete Bibliography\\" at Ishmael Reed website. Text Set in 1920s New York City, the novel depicts the elderly Harlem houngan PaPa LaBas and his companion Black Herman racing against the Wallflower Order, an international conspiracy dedicated to monotheism and control, as they attempt to root out the cause of and deal with the \\"Jes Grew\\" virus, a personification of ragtime, jazz, polytheism, and freedom. The Wallflower Order is said to work in concert with a still- existentKnights Templar order was in fact disbanded in 1312. Knights Templar Order to prevent people from dancing, to end the dance crazes spreading among black people. The virus is spread by certain black artists, referred to in the novel as \\"Jes Grew Carriers\\" or \\"J.G.C.s.\\" Historical, social, and political events mingle freely with fictional inventions. The United States' occupation of Haiti, attempts by whites to suppress jazz music, and the widespread belief that president Warren Harding had black ancestry are mingled with a plot in which the novel's hero, PaPa LaBas, searches for a mysterious book that has disappeared with black militant Abdul Sufi Hamid (whose name reflects that of the Harlem streetcorner radical preacher Sufi Abdul Hamid, a.k.a. Eugene Brown, an early black convert to Islam), as a group of radicals plans to return museum treasures looted from ancient Egypt to Africa, and the Atonists within the Wallflower Order are trying to locate and train the perfect \\"Talking Android,\\" a black man who will renounce African-American culture in favor of European American culture. One of the supporting characters, an ally of Papa La Bas, is Black Herman (Bejamin Rucker, 1892‚Äì1934), an actual African-American stage magician and root doctor. Another touch of realism is the inclusion of a mysterious ocean liner that is part of the Black Star Line, a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey, who organized the United Negro Improvement Association. Portions of the action take place at the \\"Villa Lewaro\\" mansion built by Madame C. J. Walker overlooking the Hudson River and at the Harlem townhouse of her daughter A'Lelia Walker, known as \\"The Dark Tower\\", located at 136th Street near Lenox Avenue. Other famous people who appear in the novel include the dance instructor Irene Castle, and the Harlem renaissance authors James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, W. E. B. Du Bois, and a veiled reference to Malcolm X. Additionally, in his project of blending the \\"real\\" and the \\"invented,\\" Reed, through Papa LaBas, recites a counter history of The Bible, whose content transforms the normative understanding of Judeo-Christian roots. Featuring Osiris, Seth, Moses and other important figures in both Egyptian and Judeo- Christian mythology, Reed re-imagines an entirely alternate past, evidenced by the Templar conflict that takes place in the novel. Magical elements Given that the protagonists of the novel are Voodoo practitioners, the novel itself contains a great deal of Voodoo terminology. In the novel, Voodoo is an effective art: PaPa LaBas practices from his Mumbo Jumbo Kathedral, and at one point his assistant is taken over by a loa whom she has neglected to feed. Voodoo itself is traced back to sharing a common ancestor with Judeo- Christianity in ancient Egypt, with Osiris as the first recipient of Jes Grew, whose effects and powers are interchangeable with that of Voodoo. Moses steals the Petro aspect of the Voodoo secrets from Isis. Other classic mythological figures include Dionysus, who is portrayed as a follower of Osiris, and Faust, who receives his magic not through a deal with the devil but through connections with black Voodoo practicitioners. Techniques of reading There are a variety of ways to approach Mumbo Jumbo as a reader. Of course, there is the conventional methodology: treat it as any other novel would be treated. However, given that Reed describes his own work as a form of poetic conjuring through \\"Neo-HooDoo,\\" it is possible to approach the text as a spiritual artifact, a relic imbued with spiritual powers within the tradition of Neo- HooDoo. In order to investigate these modes of relating to the text spiritually, it is suggested that readers educate themselves about Nkisi and Mojo bags, two possible models of sacred objects within African-derived religions. Background Mumbo Jumbo draws freely on conspiracy theory, hoodoo, and voodoo traditions, as well as the Afrocentric theories of Marcus Garvey and the occult author Henri Gamache, especially Gamache's theory that the Biblical prophet Moses was black. The book's title is explained by a quote from the first edition of the American Heritage Dictionary deriving the phrase from Mandingo mƒÅ-mƒÅ-gyo-mb≈ç meaning a \\"magician who makes the troubled spirits of ancestors go away.\\" Format The format and typography of Mumbo Jumbo are unique and make allusion to several typographic and stylistic conventions not normally associated with novels. The text begins and ends as if it were a movie script, with credits, a fade-in, and a freeze-frame followed by the publication and title pages which occur after chapter one. This is followed by a closing section that mimics a scholarly book on social history or folk magic by citing a lengthy bibliography. In addition, the tale is illustrated with drawings, photographs, and collages, some of which relate to the text, some of which look like illustrations from a social-studies book on African-American history, and some of which seem to be included as a cryptic protest against the Vietnam War. Mumbo Jumbo both depends on and fosters the disorientation of the reader. Rather than stick to any semblance of a novel's conventions, Reed supplies us with a hodgepodge of hand-written letters, radio dispatches, photographs, various typefaces, drawings, and even footnotes. With the first and second chapters interrupted by copyright and title pages, we even get the sense we're looking at a cinematic title screen. This is all to say that Reed is constantly blurring the lines of those things traditionally understood as distinct‚Äîin this case, form. In this vein he seems adamant to defamiliarize the familiar. Literary criticism Scholars such as Alondra Nelson have considered Reed's text as an Afrofuturist text because of the synchronization of voodoo tropes and technology which contributes to its unique form. \\"Reed's synchronous model defies the progressive linearity of much recent technocultural criticism\\" (Nelson 8). The non-linear narration, which is cinematic, plays on Afrofuturism's relationship between technology, black magic, and race‚Äîto whit: Also, Nelson deals with Reed's use of technology and its functionality in the text. The \\"‚Ä¶technologies from the setting's future and the author's present inhabit a story situated in the past,\\" in Mumbo Jumbo allows for the emergence of African diasporic technologies in the text. This \\"anachronistic\\" nature of Mumbo Jumbo troubles widely accepted conceptualizations of technology, especially in thinking about \\"when\\" cultural innovations were created and by \\"whom.\\" James A. Snead sees the novel's structure as engaged of the African-American musical and rhetorical trope of \\"the cut\\", an interruption that disrupts the linear temporality of the work, looping back to an earlier textual moment.Snead, James A. \\"On Repetition in Black Culture.\\" Black American Literature Forum, No. 15, Vol. 4, Black Textual Strategies, Vol. 1: Theory (Winter 1984). 146‚Äì54. Neil Schmitz's investigates the Reed's experimentation with Neo Hoodoo where the writer does not use it as a literary form but as a \\"characteristic stance, a mythological provenace, a behavior, a complex, of attitudes, the retrieval of an idiom...\\" (Schmitz 127). Analyzing Mumbo Jumbo as a \\"signifying pastiche of Afro-American narrative tradition\\"Gates, Henry Louis, Jr., \\"The 'Blackness of Blackness': A Critique of the Sign and the Signifying Monkey\\", Critical Inquiry, Vol. 9, No. 4 (June 1983), pp. 685‚Äì723. Henry Louis Gates posits that Reed's novel opens up a narrative space in which the intricate relationship between black and Western literary forms and conventions are critiqued. Pushing Gates' notion of \\"signifying pastiche\\" into the realm of the Afrofuturism, Alondra Nelson holds that Mumbo Jumbo imagines a version of African Diaspora that refuses to detach from tradition as it navigates modernity. For instance, PaPa LaBas make sense of the nuances of black modernity through his use of Haitian \\"Hoodoo\\" practices. As such, Reed mobilizes a \\"future-primitive perspective\\",Nelson, Alondra. \\"Introduction Future Texts\\", Social Text, 71 (Vol. 20, Number 2), Summer 2002, pp. 1‚Äì15. which animates the past through the future. Themes = Reclaiming history = Throughout the novel, Reed seeks to deconstruct the fundamental foundations upon which white, western civilization rests. This is exemplified by the Mu'tafika, an organization whose sole purpose is to steal historical artifacts from Western museums and return them to their place of origin. Additionally, the primary manifestation of this occurs in Papa LaBas' 30-page story of The Work (the original practice emanating from the text from which Jes Grew came) and its Egyptian roots. Reed uses this history to explicitly undermine the legitimacy of the monotheistic religions on which Western civilization rest. More important, though, is the fact that it does not matter whether or not the reader believes the tale to be true; what matters instead, for Reed, is the fact that an entire population was denied the right to hear his history and the right to choose to believe it. With the framework of Jes Grew already established as a real phenomenon in the novel, Reed's 30-page history imagines a powerful origin and meaning that has, in the course of the African-American slavery experience, been strategically precluded. = Jes Grew = In Mumbo Jumbo, Reed speaks of the creation of an intrinsically \\"black text\\", which is manifested in \\"Jes Grew\\". \\"Jes Grew\\", Reed's \\"virus\\", alludes to the dissemination of uniquely African-American culture in the 1920s that \\"traversed the land in search of its Text: the lost liturgy seeking its litany\\".Ishmael Reed, Mumbo Jumbo, 1972, p. 211. The \\"Jes Grew\\" virus influences people to listen to music, dance, and be happy. In many ways Jes Grew is like the funk. The infectious virus ultimately gets suppressed at the end of the plot of the novel. However, at the end of the novel, when Papa Labas is speaking to a college classroom in the 1970s, he talks about how the '70s are like the '20s again.Reed, Mumbo Jumbo 1972, p. 218. He believes this is the time for Jes Grew to rise. In this instance Papa Labas taps into a similarity between the styles of music that Jes Grew needs to grow; '20s jazz and '70s funk share an aesthetic that calls people to dance. Jes Grew needs the physical expression of music to grow. Influence The ZBS Foundation dramatized the novel for a 1980 radio drama of the same name directed by Thomas Lopez. Parliament-Funkadelic leader George Clinton has cited Mumbo Jumbo as a primary source of inspiration for his P-Funk mythology.Vincent, Rickey (1996), Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, p. 177. In Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel Gravity's Rainbow, a remark by the narrator places Reed in the heart of postmodern intertextuality, saying: \\"Well, and keep in mind where those Masonic Mysteries came from in the first place. (Check out Ishmael Reed. He knows more about it than you will ever find here.)\\"Pynchon, Thomas, Gravity's Rainbow, London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 588.

It debuted in arcades in 1999 and was later ported for the Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 in 2000. Several enhanced editions of the game were released, including the updates Dead or Alive 2 Millennium and Dead or Alive 2 Hardcore. Dead or Alive 2 improved upon the graphics engine of its predecessor by using Sega NAOMI hardware and on the gameplay system by including many new features, leading to critical acclaim and strong sales. In 2004, DOA2 was remade for the Xbox as part of Dead or Alive Ultimate. Gameplay Kasumi and Leifang in DOA2 on the Dreamcast The gameplay of Dead or Alive 2, and all subsequent DOA fighting games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds. The other defining feature of the game, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. Many attacks can inflict a stun on the opponent; those stunned cannot attack or guard, however they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi- tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \\"Danger Zone\\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage (the first game to implement this feature was SNK's Samurai Shodown 64), and upon completing the game, presenting the player with (sometimes ambiguous) endings for each character using the game's standard engine. Characters Dead or Alive 2 features a total of 14 playable fighters, plus the unplayable Kasumi X. Two of them are unlockable and cannot be used in story mode or in the arcade version. The ten returning veterans from the first DOA game are Ayane, Bass Armstrong, Bayman (unlockable), Gen Fu, Jann Lee, Kasumi, Leifang, Ryu Hayabusa, Tina Armstrong, and Zack. The four newcomers are Ein, Helena Douglas, Leon, and Tengu (unlockable boss). =New= *Ein, a merciless karateka with serious amnesia, now cannot remember his past life and aims to find answers to his self-discovery through participation in the second tournament. *Helena Douglas, a French opera singer, piguaquan practitioner, and the illegitimate daughter of the founder and former DOATEC leader, Fame Douglas, whose recent assassination has pulled Helena into despair. Her mother, while accompanying her daughter on stage at the Opera House, took a bullet meant for Helena. Helena vowed to seek revenge on the assassin. Discovering that the murder of both her parents is somehow related to DOATEC, she joins the second tournament, determined to find the assassin. *Leon, an Italian mercenary soldier and Russian martial arts practitioner who wanders all over the world. His lover Rolande, a thief who worked the Silk Road, died in his arms murmuring that he the man she loves is the strongest man in the world. In order to fulfill the last words of Rolande, Leon aspires to be the strongest man on earth. *Tengu (unlockable), real name Gohyakumine Bankotsubo; an evil tengu of the tengu world who murdered his leader, Kuramasan Maouson. He enters the human world to create chaos and make it reign over the world. =Returning= *Ayane *Bass Armstrong *Bayman (unlockable) *Gen Fu *Jann Lee *Kasumi *Leifang *Ryu Hayabusa *Tina Armstrong *Zack Plot Fame Douglas, founder and CEO of DOATEC was killed at the end of the 20th century. He was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. After his death, the world began to become chaotic. In the middle of the chaos, it was announced that the second Dead or Alive World Combat Championship will be held. The purpose and significance of the tournament changed after Douglas' death. The promoter of the second Dead or Alive Championship, who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the strong, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter, Victor Donovan, is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament began to bring a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous tengu disaster. Set less than a year later after the original tournament, a tengu known as Gohyakumine Bankotsubo, or just Tengu, threatens the human world's peace and stability. Kasumi, who won the first tournament was captured by the DOATEC Super-human Development project. Kasumi escapes, but her clone \\"Kasumi X\\" was created while she was being held captive. Kasumi's brother Hayate, previously injured by Raidou, was also captured and returns from being an unwilling subject of DOATEC's bio-weapon experiment Epsilon left to die in the esoteric Black forest of Germany as \\"Ein\\" after the experiment was a failure. Ryu Hayabusa (from Ninja Gaiden) enters the tournament vowing to seek and destroy the evil tengu. Though a dangerous, suicidal task for any ordinary man, Hayabusa owes it to himself and to mankind to confront his fate. Hayabusa tries to warn other competitors like Jann Lee about the dangers of the tournament but finds them unwilling to backdown so he proceeds to knock them out of the tournament. He meets Ein, who is actually the missing Hayate suffering from amnesia. During their fight, Hayabusa defeats him and restores some semblance of his memory. Eventually, Hayabusa comes face to face with the evil Tengu. He defeats Tengu, winning the tournament. Development and release The graphics and gameplay were enhanced and based on a better game engine than the one used in the first game, which allowed the characters and stages to appear less angular and more detailed. A popular and commonly discussed feature, one credited to Tomonobu Itagaki, was the level of graphical detail Tecmo put into the animated breasts of the female characters, as Tecmo went so far as to create a physics engine dedicated entirely to the animation of the female characters' breasts. Dead or Alive 2 used the song \\"Exciter\\" by Bomb Factory in its opening sequence. Also used as a background track was \\"Deadly Silence Beach\\" and \\"Clumsy Bird\\". Both tracks can be found on the self-titled mini-album Bomb Factory and on the Dead or Alive 2 Soundtrack. Two soundtrack CDs were released in 2000 by Wake Up in Japan: Dead or Alive 2 Original Sound Trax (KWCD-1001) and Dead or Alive 2 Original Sound Trax (KWCD-1004). Several Japanese guide books for the game were published by SoftBank (Dead or Alive 2 Perfect Guide, Dead or Alive 2 Perfect Guide Dreamcast Ban, Dead or Alive 2 Hard Core Perfect Guide) and Dengeki (Dead or Alive 2 K≈çshiki K≈çryaku Guide, Dead or Alive 2 K≈çshiki K≈çryaku & Girls, Dead or Alive 2 Hard Core K≈çshiki K≈çryaku Guide). =Home versions= Nine different versions (excluding DOA2 Ultimate on Xbox and the two PSN releases) of Dead or Alive 2 were released: two for the arcade market, and the others were home versions. Tomonobu Itagaki and Team Ninja were constantly enhancing the game for both the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 as they worked towards their vision of the \\"ultimate fighting game\\". The Dreamcast port was first released in North America on February 29, 2000. It was identical to the arcade Millennium update release, but added the usual Versus and Sparring modes, as well as Team Battle Mode. This version also featured a simplified hold system, which would become standard for the rest of the series. Unlike home ports of the first Dead or Alive game, there were no unlockables in this release. Dead or Alive 2 was the only game that Tecmo published on the Dreamcast. Dead or Alive 2 was released on March 30, 2000 as a launch title for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. This version added new stages (Crimson, Koku An and Prairie) and new unlockable costumes. The game engine ran using Field Rendering instead of Frame Rendering, thus it appeared much more aliased than the Dreamcast ports. This version was buggy and prone to lock up in Versus mode. Itagaki and his team were only given two months initially to produce the first PlayStation 2 port. At the end of this, one of his managers asked to borrow a copy to play, but instead sent in to a production factory. Itagaki was upset by not being able to finish the game on his own terms and fell into a depression during which he briefly considered quitting the industry. The European Dreamcast version was released on May 26, 2000. This version included the costumes from the Japanese PlayStation 2 version, but not the new stages. It also added new costumes for Zack and Tina, which pay homage to The Shadow Man and his love interest from the Shadow Man series. Acclaim developed the Shadow Man video game and published Dead or Alive 2 in Europe. The Japanese Dreamcast version (known as the Limited Edition) was released on September 28, 2000. Cover art featured Kasumi and Ayane, along with a standard cover art version with Kasumi, Ayane and Leifang. The most notable addition was that Bankotsubo and Bayman were now unlockable, playable in all but Story Mode. The new stages from the PlayStation 2 version were not included, in favor of new versions of Burai Zenin and L's Castle stages from the first game. This version also added Sparring mode for Tag Battle, Watch Mode, the User Profile System, online play, more costumes to unlock, and a Gallery Mode with character renders. On October 25, 2000, Tecmo released DOA2: Hardcore for the PlayStation 2 in America and Europe, which was based on the Japanese second update of Dead or Alive 2 for Dreamcast. This version was featuring new playable characters, new stages, extra costumes and introduced the \\"Gallery\\" option. The Hard*core release was finally the complete game Itagaki had envisioned at the time, featuring many changes compared to its predecessor: Characters, pictures and moves were altered to appear more realistic, lessening the anime-look. Some fighting animations were elaborated upon, while others were cut. New stages were added (8 more than the Dreamcast update). More character outfits were added. Survival Mode now only took place in the \\"Danger Zone\\" arena. Overall gameplay speed was increased, and the entire game (including cutscenes) now ran at a full 60 frames-per- second (in the Dreamcast version, the game ran at 60fps, while cutscenes ran at 30). A special \\"Items Collection\\" feature and menu section was added to appeal to video game collectors. New artworks were added, and a CG Gallery section featuring renders of the female characters was added. The player history files were enhanced, and now included statistics on how often the player used each character, and tag battle pairing. Several special moves were added, but left undocumented. English voiceovers were added in addition to the original Japanese voice overs. Kasumi can be unlocked as a trainable 'monster' in Monster Rancher 4 by going to the Shrine, and inserting the DOA2: Hardcore disk in the PS2. Tecmo followed up on the release of Hardcore in the US and Europe with the release of DOA2: Hard*Core in Japan. This last version saw some minor updates, including new cutscenes, a few new costumes, and a new turbo speed option. This was the last Dead or Alive game to be released for a Sony system as well as the last one to be released for the arcades, as the series became exclusive to the Xbox until the release of Dead or Alive Paradise, Dead or Alive: Dimensions, and Dead or Alive 5 respectively. In August 2012, a software emulated version of DOA2: Hard*Core was made available as a downloadable game on the Japanese PlayStation Network. The North American version was released to PlayStation Network in March 2015. Reception Dead or Alive 2 brought more than $2 million profit in sales.. As of 2020, DOA2 is considered one of the best Fighting games in the genre in terms of gameplay and expanded game modes . In Japan, Game Machine listed Dead or Alive 2 on their December 15, 1999 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year.. At console release, the Dreamcast version was met with critical acclaim, while the PlayStation 2 version received positive reviews. Both versions were praised for its graphics, cutscenes and gameplay, however the PS2 version was criticised (much like other English dub Japanese video games) for the bad English voices. Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"You'd have to be Dead and Buried not be enjoy Dead or Alive 2. Gorgeous graphics, excellent gameplay, and some beautiful characters put this square in the running against Namco's Soul Calibur as the best Dreamcast fighting game.\\" Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is a tremendous game and a must-have, but if you can choose between the two versions, PS2 enjoys an edge thanks to all the extras ‚Äì just get used to squinting at the too-bright lights and nasty jaggies.\\" Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of DOA 2: Hardcore for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is the best-looking, most full- featured, most packed-with-extras version of one of the best fighting games ever made. Buy it, period.\\" GamesRadar+ included the game on their list of best Dreamcast games, stating that \\"Dead or Alive's first sequel used separate graphics engines for its fighting and cut-scenes, allowing for unprecedented graphical fidelity.\\" In 2010, UGO.com ranked it as the ninth top fighting game of all time, \\"perhaps most important for introducing Itagaki's famous breast physics engine.\\"Top 25 Fighting Games of All Time , UGO, July 11, 2010. Remake Dead or Alive Ultimate is a remake of DOA and DOA2 for the Xbox with a greatly improved graphics engine. As it was created after Dead or Alive 3, it takes elements and mechanics from both its original iteration and successor. The action of 3D-axis movement is as free-formatted as DOA3, and Hitomi, as well as Tengu are now playable characters (albeit outside story mode), but other elements have been kept intact from DOA2. The biggest set of changes instituted in Dead or Alive Ultimate are online play over Xbox Live and the inclusion of slopes, which are a type of environmental hazard.

The motifs associated with his depiction on Cop√°n monuments have a distinct resemblance to imagery associated with the height of the Classic-era center of Teotihuacan in the distant northern central Mexican region, and have been interpreted as intending to suggest his origins and association with that prestigious civilization. One of the most commonly cited motifs for this interpretation is the \\"goggle-eyed\\" headdress with which Yax K ºuk º Mo º is commonly depicted; this is seemingly an allusion to the northern central Mexican rain deity known as Tlaloc by later peoples, such as the Aztecs. However, modern strontium isotope analysis of the human remains recovered from the tomb attributed to him indicate that K ºinich Yax K ºuk º Mo º spent his formative years much closer to Cop√°n, at Tikal, and had not himself lived at Teotihuacan.

The skeleton exhibited a number of traumas including healed fractures of the arm, sternum, and shoulder which have been surmised to have resulted from ball court matches. Analysis of strontium in the teeth of the skeleton indicates that the individual spent his early years near Tikal in the Pet√©n Basin region and then at some point between Tikal and Cop√°n, and the isotopic signature did not match with a Teotihuacan origin. Chronologically and epigraphically, however, much evidence points to the general ascension of rulers who were sent into the lowland Maya region either as invaders or envoys from Teotihuacan during the late 4th century; particularly the widely known and powerful Yax Nuun Ayiin I of Tikal, son of Teotihuacan lord Spearthrower Owl.see Stuart (1998) The implication of this, regardless of K ºinich Yax K ºuk º Mo's physical point of geographic origin, is that later Cop√°n rulers, in particular K ºak º Yipyaj Chan K ºawiil and Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat retrospectively sought to attribute Teotihuacano heritage to the  ºfounding º ruler of their dynasty as a means of legitimising the dynastic claim.See Skidmore (n.d.) for summary of recent research.

It was originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998, and was later ported to the Dreamcast in 2000 and released worldwide. An Android version was released in Korean in 2014, it came out worldwide on both Android and iOS in 2016. The arcade game was also included in Gunbird Special Edition for the PlayStation 2. A version was released on Nintendo Switch in June 2018. Gameplay A screenshot of Tavia battling the Queen Pirates in the USA stage There are seven stages in each game loop (two loops total). The first three stages are randomly chosen from possible four. At the second loop, enemies fire denser bullet patterns moving at faster speeds. Stage 2-1 takes place at the only stage not available in 1st loop, instead of the 1-1 counterpart. After completing the first loop with only one player, player can choose one of two choices for a wish with magic potion, with unique ending for each choice. If 1st loop is completed with two players, a combination-specific ending is played. This was the first Psikyo shooter to feature medal-chaining: picking up 2000 point medals (when they flash) repeatedly results in a slight point increase and a coin chain, recorded separately from the score. This was later featured in Strikers 1945 III/Strikers 1999. The arcade game supports both English and Japanese languages, chosen via arcade board dip switch settings. The language setting is Japanese if dip switches are set to Japanese, English otherwise. Two exclusive playable characters in the Sega Dreamcast port of Gunbird 2, released in 2000, includes Morrigan Aensland from the Darkstalkers series and Aine from the Samurai Aces series.

Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you want a ridiculously high level of pure twitch-response challenge, look no further. If you don't, well, move along.\\" Gunbird 2 received mostly positive reviews. The Dreamcast version received scores of 8.5/10 from both Gaming Target and Planet Dreamcast, while Game Revolution graded it a B-. It also scored an 80% from French Consoles + while the three reviewers from Dreamcast Magazine each gave it a 7/10. IGN's Anthony Chau gave it an 8.4/10, stating: \\"I hope that most of you that decide to get Gunbird 2 are those that know the excitement of weaving between enemy fire, appreciate 2D artistry, and respect classic gameplay that never gets old.

Carroll (born September 17, 1960) is an American evolutionary developmental biologist, author, educator and executive producer. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. His studies focus on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements in the regulation of gene expression in the context of biological development, using Drosophila as a model system. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, of the American Philosophical Society (2007), of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for Advancement of Science, as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Biography Carroll was born in Toledo, Ohio. He has stated that, as a kid, he would flip over rocks looking for snakes, and at age 11 or 12, he started keeping snakes. This activity led him to notice the patterns on the snakes and wonder how those form. Carroll got his B.A. in Biology at Washington University in St. Louis, his Ph.D. in immunology from Tufts University and did post-doctoral work at the University of Colorado Boulder. Career Carroll is at the forefront of a field known as evolutionary developmental biology (also known as \\"evo-devo\\"), studying how gene changes control the evolution of body parts and patterns. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and an investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 1987, Carroll set up a laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \\"focused on understanding how genes get used in different ways to generate the diversity of form that we see\\". The Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology lists Carroll's interests as \\"Genetic control of body pattern in fruit flies, butterflies, and other animals\\". Carroll's team has shown, in a series of papers, how the activation of genes during the embryonic stages of the Drosophila fruit fly control the development of its wings, and has been searching for the butterfly's counterparts of these genes. In 1989, he received the Shaw Scientist Award from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation. In 2006, Carroll was interviewed by PBS as part of the NOVA documentary \\"The Family That Walks on All Fours\\", about a family in Turkey that has members who walk on their hands and feet. In this interview, he discusses the possible genetic underpinnings of this family's condition. From September 2009 to March 2013, he wrote a column for The New York Times called \\"Remarkable Creatures\\", where he would discuss findings in animal evolution. In 2010, he was named vice-president for science education of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 2011, the HHMI launched a documentary film initiative to produce science features for television, to which Carroll was appointed as one of the executive producers. In 2012, one such film, called The Day the Mesozoic Died, retracing the investigation that led to the discovery of the asteroid collision that triggered the mass extinction at the end of that Era, was introduced by Carroll at a National Teacher's Conference. In 2010, Carroll received the Stephen Jay Gould Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution. In 2012, he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science from the Franklin Institute \\"for proposing and demonstrating that the diversity and multiplicity of animal life is largely due to the different ways that the same genes are regulated rather than to mutation of the genes themselves.\\" In 2016, he was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize at the Rockefeller University. Carroll is a proponent of the extended evolutionary synthesis. Since 2013, Carroll has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.

It‚Äôs not just a painless way to learn, it‚Äôs positively fun.\\" The documentary film, The Serengeti Rules, was released in 2018 and is based on Carroll's book. Louise S. Mead, reviewing The Making of the Fittest for the National Center for Science Education, notes that Carroll provides \\"some of the overwhelming evidence for evolution provided in DNA\\", using different lines of inquiry such as DNA sequences that code for genes no longer in use, and evidence of evolutionary change. Mead notes that evolutionary theory has predictive power, as with icefish whose ancestors had haemoglobin, but no longer needing it in icy water, they have lost it. Douglas H. Erwin, reviewing Endless Forms Most Beautiful for Artificial Life, remarks that life forms from Drosophila to man have far fewer genes than many biologists expected ‚Äì in man's case, only some 20,000, which is about the same as a fly. He notes the \\"astonishing morphological diversity\\" of animals coming from \\"such a limited number of genes\\". He praises Carroll's \\"insightful and enthusiastic\\" style, writing in a \\"witty and engaging\\" way, pulling the reader into the complexities of Hox and PAX-6, as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms, and much else.

They were introduced by Ulisse Dini who studied continuous but nondifferentiable functions, for which he defined the so-called Dini derivatives. The upper Dini derivative, which is also called an upper right-hand derivative, of a continuous function :f:{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R}, is denoted by and defined by :f'_+(t) = \\\\limsup_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}, where is the supremum limit and the limit is a one-sided limit. The lower Dini derivative, , is defined by :f'_-(t) = \\\\liminf_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t) - f(t - h)}{h}, where is the infimum limit. If is defined on a vector space, then the upper Dini derivative at in the direction is defined by :f'_+ (t,d) = \\\\limsup_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t + hd) - f(t)}{h}. If is locally Lipschitz, then is finite. If is differentiable at , then the Dini derivative at is the usual derivative at . Remarks * The functions are defined in terms of the infimum and supremum in order to make the Dini derivatives as \\"bullet proof\\" as possible, so that the Dini derivatives are well-defined for almost all functions, even for functions that are not conventionally differentiable. The upshot of Dini's analysis is that a function is differentiable at the point on the real line (), only if all the Dini derivatives exist, and have the same value. * Sometimes the notation is used instead of and is used instead of . * Also, :D^{+}f(t) = \\\\limsup_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h} and :D_{-}f(t) = \\\\liminf_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t) - f(t - h)}{h}. * So when using the notation of the Dini derivatives, the plus or minus sign indicates the left- or right-hand limit, and the placement of the sign indicates the infimum or supremum limit. * There are two further Dini derivatives, defined to be :D_{+}f(t) = \\\\liminf_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h} and :D^{-}f(t) = \\\\limsup_{h \\\\to {0+}} \\\\frac{f(t) - f(t - h)}{h}. which are the same as the first pair, but with the supremum and the infimum reversed. For only moderately ill-behaved functions, the two extra Dini derivatives aren't needed.

Squire was an executive with the Standard Oil Company and former mayor of Wickliffe, Ohio. Squire's earliest known residence was at 1729 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. In 1905, Squire moved to 7809 Euclid Avenue. Squire completed work in 1902 on Cobblestone Garth, a Victorian mansion located in Wickliffe, Ohio. The Squires moved from their Euclid Avenue home into Cobblestone Garth in 1910. About 1890, Squire purchased of forest land near what is now Willoughby Hills, Ohio, east of Cleveland. He called it River Farm Estate, and planned to turn it into an English country estate complete with manor house. About 1895, Squire began construction on a gatekeeper's house in the Romanesque Revival style. The structure, which was exceedingly rustic (lacking electricity, natural gas, running water, or sewer) was completed about 1897. The outer walls are of locally-quarried Euclid bluestone, a form of bluish-colored sandstone found throughout the greater Cleveland area. The structure originally had a ground floor, two upper floors, and a basement. Its windows were of leaded glass. Use of the structure Feargus B. Squire Squire abandoned plans for a manor house after encountering difficulty obtaining building materials and labor. Squire and his daughter used the gatekeeper's house as an occasional weekend country home (even spending most of the summer of 1903 there). But Squire's wife disliked the house, and Squire rarely visited it after 1908. He sold the estate and gatekeeper's house to developers in 1922. After the developers went bankrupt, the estate was seized by a local bank. The Cleveland Park Board (precursor to Cleveland Metroparks) purchased most of the land from the bank in 1925. The park board began calling the structure \\"Squire's Castle\\". Cleveland Metroparks removed the upper floors and filled in the basement. Squire's Castle was heavily vandalized over the years, with vandals removing the leaded glass windows and stripping the interior of almost all architectural and decorative details. The structure was somewhat restored in 1995. Urban myth On December 26, 1876, Squire married Louisa Christiana Braymaier of Cleveland. She died on October 29, 1927, at Cobblestone Garth in Wickliffe.; A myth about the structure grew up over the years. The details varied, but the essential story was that Louisa Squire woke one night during a storm and went downstairs to investigate. Startled by lightning (which illuminated the stuffed heads of animals in the structure's trophy room), she fell down the stairs and broke her neck. According to this legend, her ghost may be seen floating through Squire's Castle. The myth is false, as Louisa Squire did not die in the building.

It is located between the southeast coast of India and Sri Lanka. Palk Bay is located between 8¬∞ 50‚Ä≤ and 10¬∞ North latitudes and 78¬∞ 50‚Ä≤ and 80¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ East longitudes. The width of Palk Bay ranges from 57 to 107 km and the length is around 150 km. Palk Bay is considered to be one amongst the major sinks for sediments along with Gulf of Mannar . Sediments discharged by rivers and transported by the surf currents as littoral drift settle in this sink. Few scientists have tried to understand the wave characteristics within the Palk Bay. In the southern regions close to Dhanushkodi, wind seas dominate. The northern Eastern region of Palk Bay is exposed to the Bay of Bengal through shallow Palk Strait and hence the swells can enter the PB through this opening. To the south of Palk Bay, Adam's Bridge separates Palk Bay from Gulf of Mannar. Despite being a very shallow channel, Wave effects are transmitted to a small extent through the Adam's Bridge passage. It is interesting to notice that, despite the visible block along the Adam's Bridge, the passage of Wind wave and Ocean current (to a very small extent) from Gulf of Mannar to the bay is evident. Meanwhile, even with wide and broader opening along the north-eastern borders of the bay, facing Bay of Bengal, the Wind wave and Ocean current fluxes are less significant here.  Ramayana and Palk Bay  Palk Bay is associated with an ancient Sanskrit epic (Ramayana) popular over the Indian Subcontinent, which follows Prince Rama's quest to rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of Ravana with the help of an army of monkeys. It is traditionally attributed to the authorship of the sage Valmiki and dated to around 500 BCE to 100 BCE. The epic describes how Prince Rama and his followers managed to cross the Palk Bay to reach Lanka (Sri Lanka), to save Sita.

In the 1990s Banjawarn was owned by the Aum Shinrikyo, and following the Tokyo subway attack was the subject of an Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigation. Banjawarn is one of the seventy largest stations in Australia. Description It is situated 350 km (220 miles) north of Kalgoorlie and 800 km (500 miles) north east of Perth, on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert in the community of Leonora. It covers an area of . The land is a mix of Wanderrie, mulga, saltbush and grasslands that support both annual and perennial grasses. Gum trees and mulga follow the four main creeks and other watercourses. Several waterholes and lake systems are also found on the property. History The station was established in 1903 and has had several owners. In 1928 Banjawarn was owned by the Warren brothers and was supporting a flock of 1,000 sheep. It was owned for a year in 1993 by the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult. In 2010 the leasees were Colvin and Adele Day. The property was carrying a herd of about 2,500 head of droughtmaster, shorthorn and Brahman cattle. Aum Shinrikyo Aum Shinrikyo was a Japanese doomsday cult responsible for a range of criminal and terrorist acts. In April 1993 they purchased Banjawarn and built a facility there. The Chairwoman for the Aboriginal community living near the sheep station, Phyllis Thomas, said that she and other Aborigines saw about five people wearing full-length suits and helmets on the remote site in late August 1993. The suited sect members were standing by a twin engine airplane and others were in the plane. In September 1993 a team of Aum scientists arrived in Australia with mislabeled hydrochloric acid among other chemicals. The Aum group traveled with chemicals and mining equipment on which they paid over $20,000 in excess baggage fees. According to the Australian Federal Police report, among the baggage was a mechanical ditch digger, picks, petrol generators, gas masks, respirators, and shovels. A customs duty of over $15,000 was paid to import these items. Because of the large amount of excess baggage being brought in by the group, Australian Customs searched the entire group. This search revealed four liters of concentrated hydrochloric acid, including some in containers marked as hand soap. Among the other chemicals that Australian customs officials found were ammonium chloride, sodium sulphate, perchloric acid, and ammonium water. All of the chemicals and some of the laboratory equipment were seized by Australian authorities. New chemicals were purchased in Australia, and a research facility of unknown purpose was established at the site. When raided by the Australian government in 1995, it contained computers and laboratory equipment. The Australian government, finding that the wells in the region were not operating properly, demanded that a manager be hired to take care of the sheep. The Aum group complied. In early 1994 the research equipment was removed and replaced with sheep farms. The Aum group demanded that they would be the only ones to shear the sheep. 2000 sheep were shorn and sold to a slaughterhouse. \\"The manager did not witness any experiments or mineral exploration.\\" The site was sold in October 1994. On 20 March 1995, the Aum group released toxic sarin gas into part of the Tokyo subway system, killing 12 people and injuring over 1000. In the subsequent investigation, it was revealed that they had purchased the Banjawarn Station, and so the AFP examined the site. The site also contained a number of sheep carcasses that showed signs of exposure to sarin. The soil in the area contained traces of methylphosphonic acid, a residue of sarin use. The conclusion was that Banjawarn had been used as a test site for chemical weapons use. Seismic event On the night of 28 May 1993 a mysterious seismic disturbance was detected in Western Australia and found to have emanated from south of Banjawarn. The event sent shock waves through hundreds of miles of desert but was witnessed only by a few long-distance truck drivers and gold prospectors. They reported seeing a fireball in the sky and hearing a protracted low- frequency sound. The cause of the event remained a mystery, however. An asteroid impact would have left a large crater, perhaps across, none of which was found. Alternatively, a bolide, or air burst, caused by a stony asteroid of up to some tens of meters in diameter, would not have reached the surface but likely would have exploded in the atmosphere, creating a large shock wave but not an impact crater. This option, the possibility of which was driven home by the widely observed February 2013 Russian meteor event, would have led to measurements and observations that are entirely consistent with data and eyewitness reports, far more so than a seismic disturbance, which would be difficult to reconcile with fireball sightings. A mine explosion was unlikely, as it was 170 times more powerful than the largest mining explosion known in Australia up to that time. The Urban Geoscience Division of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation determined that the seismic traces of the event \\"showed similar characteristics consistent with typical seismic activity for Western Australia\\", and that the event was most likely an earthquake.\\"Did the Aum Shinrikyo cult detonate an atom bomb in Australia?\\" Cecil Adams, The Straight Dope, 17 August 2001 Following the revelation that Banjawarn was owned by the Aum, there was also speculation in 1997 that this event might have been the result of a test explosion of a nuclear device they had built. The event was determined to have had the strength of \\"a small nuclear explosion, perhaps equal to up to 2,000 tons of high explosives\\". It was known that Aum were interested in developing nuclear as well as chemical weapons, as they had recruited two nuclear engineers from the former Soviet Union and had been mining uranium at Banjawarn.William J. Broad, \\"Seismic Mystery in Australia: Quake, Meteor or Nuclear Blast?\\", The New York Times, 21 January 1997 However, the AFP investigation found no evidence of this or of any equipment that might indicate such research, and the Aum cult members were believed to not be in the country at the time of the event.

The round and flat variation is often called a millstone collar after its resemblance to that object. Elizabeth Lace ruffles in the early 17th century History goffering iron, for ironing lace and making ruff collars. Long rod to the right, curved stand for the rod to the left. From York Castle Museum The ruff, which was worn by men, women and children, evolved from the small fabric ruffle at the drawstring neck of the shirt or chemise. They served as changeable pieces of cloth that could themselves be laundered separately while keeping the wearer's doublet or gown from becoming soiled at the neckline. The stiffness of the garment forced upright posture, and their impracticality led them to become a symbol of wealth and status. Ruffs were primarily made from linen cambric, stiffened with starch imported from the Low Countries. Later ruffs were also sometimes made entirely from lace. However, lace was expensive since it was a new fabric, developed in the early sixteenth century. The size of the ruff increased as the century went on. \\"Ten yards is enough for the ruffs of the neck and hand\\" for a New Year's gift made by her ladies for Queen Elizabeth in 1565,Mary S. Lovell, Bess of Hardwick, Empire Builder 2005:184. but the discovery of starch allowed ruffs to be made wider without losing their shape. Later ruffs were separate garments that could be washed, starched, and set into elaborate figure-of-eight folds by the use of heated cone-shaped goffering irons. Ruffs were often coloured during starching, vegetable dyes were used to give the ruff a yellow, pink or mauve tint.Picard, Liza. Elizabeth's London (2003) A pale blue colour could also be obtained via the use of smalt, although Elizabeth I took against this colour and issued a royal prerogative: \\"Her Majesty's pleasure is that no blue starch shall be used or worn by any of her Majesty's subjects, since blue was the colour of the flag of Scotland ...\\"Forbes, T. R. Chronicle from Aldgate (1971) Setting and maintaining the structured and voluminous shape of the ruff could be extremely difficult due to changes in body heat or weather. For this reason, they could be worn only once before losing their shape. At their most extreme, ruffs were a foot or more wide; these cartwheel ruffs required a wire frame called a supportasse or underpropper to hold them at the fashionable angle. Ruffs could make it difficult to eat during mealtimes, similar to the cangue. By the start of the seventeenth century, ruffs were falling out of fashion in Western Europe, in favour of wing collars and falling bands. The fashion lingered longer in the Dutch Republic, where ruffs can be seen in portraits well into the seventeenth century, and farther east. It also stayed on as part of the ceremonial dress of city councillors (Senatoren) in North German Hanseatic cities and of Lutheran clergy in those cities and in Denmark, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. The ruff was banned in Spain under Philip IV (orchestrated by Gaspar de Guzm√°n, Count-Duke of Olivares). =Today= A priest in the Church of Denmark wearing a ruff (2015) Ruffs remain part of the formal attire of bishops and ministers in the Church of Denmark (including Greenland) and the Church of the Faroe Islands and are generally worn for services. The Church of Norway removed the ruff from its clergy uniform in 1980, although some conservative ministers, such as B√∏rre Knudsen, continued to wear them. Ruffs are optional for trebles in Anglican church choirs. The judges of the Constitutional Court of Italy wear a robe with an elementar ruff in the neck. Underground artist Klaus Nomi used a ruff as part of his concert attire toward the end of his life, both to complement the Renaissance-era music he focused on during his late career, and to hide the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions on his neck. In the twentieth century, the ruff inspired the name of the Elizabethan collar for animals.

He is universally referred to by rebetiko writers and fans simply by his first name, M√°rkos. The great significance of Vamvakaris for the rebetiko is also reflected by his nickname: the \\"patriarch of the rebetiko\\".Vamvakaris, 1978. Biography Vamvakaris was born on 10 May 1905 in Ano Syros (or Ano Khora), Syros, Greece. He was the first of six children, while his family belonged to the sizeable Roman Catholic community of the island, the \\"Francosyrians\\", a name deriving from the colloquial Greek reference to West Europeans collectively as \\"the Franks\\". At the age of twelve, in the false belief that he was wanted by the police, Vamvakaris fled Syros for the port of Piraeus. He worked as a stevedore, a pit-coal miner, a shoe-polisher, a paperboy, a butcher, and other odd jobs. He heard a bouzouki player playing, and vowed that if he did not learn to play the instrument in six months he would chop off his own hand with a cleaver (he was working in the public abattoirs at the time). He learned bouzouki, becoming an innovative virtuoso player, and began to write songs of his own. At first he often played in clandestine hashish- smoking establishments known as tek√©s; later he and his band, which included Giorgos Batis, Anestis Delias and Stratos Pagioumtzis played in more legitimate clubs and taverns. They were extremely popular, and Markos made many recordings. His initial nickname among the rebetes was \\"the Frank\\" (Fragos). Spyros Peristeris, a well-educated musician and repertory manager and orchestra leader for several recording companies, persuaded Vamvakaris to record his songs sung with his own voice. Vamvakaris recorded his first rebetiko disc, Na'rch√≥souna re magka mou (ŒùŒ± 'œÅœáœåœÉŒøœÖŒΩŒ± œÅŒµ ŒºŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫Œ± ŒºŒøœÖ) in 1932. Among other songs in that period, he wrote the classic love song \\"Frankosyriani\\" (Œ¶œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒøœÉœÖœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩŒÆ). After the liberation of Greece from the occupation of Nazi Germany, difficult times persisted, but his kind of music was no longer fashionable. He also suffered badly with arthritis in his hands which crippled his bouzouki playing, and from asthma that hampered his singing. The slump in his fortunes lasted until the early 1960s when, after initiatives by Vassilis Tsitsanis, many of his old songs were revived and sung by singers including Grigoris Bithikotsis, and Stratos Dionysiou. Vamvakaris died on 8 February 1972 at the age of 66. Markos' composing style was utterly simple: minimal orchestration, melodic lines stripped of any embellishment, and lyrics as devoid of ornamentation as possible. His strophic masterpiece \\"Your eyelashes shine\\" is a typical example of his art. It consists of just three short couplets, each sung twice to the same melodic phrase, with clauses reversed for the second time, and with a single instrumental phrase interspersed between them: > :Your eyelashes shine ::like the flowers of the meadow. :Your eyes, sister, > ::make my little heart crack. :Search till you're blind: ::you won't find > another like me. As the years pass, his towering contribution to Greek music emerges. All other Greek composers, of his time and afterwards, revere him as their master teacher, and Mikis Theodorakis remarked: \\"We all, we are but branches of a tree. Markos is that tree\\". Discography Markos may be heard on many of the anthology CDs listed in the rebetiko discography. CDs of his own which may be available in English language countries include: * Markos Vamvakaris Bouzouki Pioneer: 1932‚Äì1940 Rounder Select, 1998. * Rembetika 5-Master of Rembetika 1932-193 [Box set] (4 discs) Jsp Records, 2010. * The Road to Rembetica Trad.

After their divorce (for which he wrote a song), he married his second wife, Evangelia, with a Greek Orthodox marriage. He had three sons: Vasilis, Stelios (a musician also) and Dominikos. In popular culture Stavros Xarchakos and Nikos Gatsos wrote a song called Gramma sto Marko Vamvakari (Letter to Markos Vamvakaris, Greek: ŒìœÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ± œÉœÑŒø ŒúŒ¨œÅŒ∫Œø ŒíŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±Œ∫Œ¨œÅŒ∑), sung by George Dalaras and actress Despo Diamantidou.

A panel consists of a single drawing depicting a frozen moment. When multiple panels are present, they are often, though not always, separated by a short amount of space called a gutter. Newspaper daily strips typically consist of either four panels (Doonesbury, For Better or For Worse) or three panels (Garfield, Dilbert). These panels may all be of the same size, but many skilled cartoonists, such as Bill Waterson, Danny Vasquetto, Leonard Waldstein, Humphrey Powell, and Ginny Thomas vary the size and number of panels in each daily strip. The horizontal newspaper strip can also employ only a single panel, as sometimes seen in Wiley Miller's Non Sequitur.Go Comics In Asia, a vertical four-panel arrangement (yonkoma) is common in newspapers, such as with Azumanga Daioh. In a comic book or graphic novel, the shapes of panels and the number of panels on a page may vary widely. The word panel may also refer to a cartoon consisting of a single drawing; the usage is a shortened form of \\"single-panel comic\\". In contrast to multi-panel strips, which may involve extended dialogue in speech balloons, a typical panel comic has only one spoken line, printed in a caption beneath the panel itself. Many panel comics are syndicated and published daily, on a newspaper page with other syndicated cartoons that are collectively known as comic strips. Major comic strips in panel format include The Far Side, Dennis the Menace, The Family Circus, Ziggy, Herman and Ripley's Believe It or Not. In this context, panels are contrasted with the more common comic strip format, which consists of an actual \\"strip\\" of multiple drawings that tell a story in sequence. Form There are two major styles used in newspaper comics, single panels and strips. Single panels are usually not broken up (though this is not always the case), and thus lack continuity. The popular Dennis the Menace, The Far Side, and The Family Circus are all single panels. Strips, on the other hand, are generally longer and shaped into a rectangle. Strips include Calvin & Hobbes, Peanuts, and Garfield. J. R. Williams' long-run Out Our Way continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip, Out Our Way with the Willets. Jimmy Hatlo's They'll Do It Every Time was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation. Early daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high.Newspaper Archive Initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. By the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. Over decades, the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller; until by the year 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip.WebCite: Comic Strip Project NEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip, Star Hawks, but after a few years, Star Hawks dropped down to a single tier.Toonopedia In Flanders, Belgium, the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily by:david Spike and Suzy and Nero.

The granite spires of the group are a popular mountaineering destination. The Bugaboos are protected within Bugaboo Provincial Park. Geography The Bugaboos are located in the northwestern extreme of the Purcells in the Columbia Mountains, in the south-east of the province. The nearest towns are Radium and Golden. They are commonly subdivided into four divisions: the Bugaboo Glacier Peaks, and the Eastern, Central, and Western Spires. The nearby Vowell and Conrad Groups are usually considered separate from the Bugaboos. Geology Located in the snow- and rain-heavy \\"Columbia Wet Belt\\", this section of the Purcells is subject to heavy erosion and large, active glaciers. Originally covered in weaker rock, glaciation eventually revealed the granodiorite batholiths which form the group's distinctive spires. The surrounding rock is approximately 600 million to 1 billion years old, while the Bugaboo intrusion dates to 135 million years ago. The igneous intrusion cooled slowly, forming the crystalline structure of the hard granite found today. History Conrad Kain Originally named the \\"Nunataks\\", the Bugaboo spires were first noted by a surveying expedition in the late 1800s. Mining brought the first Europeans to the region with a small, ill-fated gold rush occurring in 1895 and 1896 near Bugaboo Falls. The area was prospected and staked, but the meager deposits turned out to be mostly pyrite and galena. The name \\"Bugaboo\\" originated from this rush; the term was used by prospectors for a \\"dead-end\\". Climbers became interested in the group shortly after. In 1910, an expedition led by Thomas Longstaff and surveyor Arthur Oliver Wheeler entered the area. They were guided by renowned European climber Conrad Kain. Kain would return to the area six years later and pioneer many difficult climbing routes. The Austrian climber described his route up Bugaboo Spire as his most difficult Canadian ascent, more challenging than his celebrated route up Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. Along with Albert and Bess McCarthy and others, Kain would pioneer first ascents of North Howser, Marmolata, and Crescent Spires. Logging in the area resulted in road construction in the 1950s and 60s. This led to a new influx of climbers. Fred Beckey and Yvon Chouinard (founder of the Patagonia clothing company) established new routes on several spires. The growing popularity of the area led the BC government to establish Bugaboo Glacier Provincial Park and the Bugaboo Alpine Recreation Area in 1969. The Alpine Club of Canada constructed a large hut in 1972 to reduce environmental damage to the fragile alpine meadows below the spires. Climbing and recreation The Bugaboos have several internationally known rock climbing routes. The Beckey-Chouinard (South Howser Spire), West Ridge (Pigeon Spire), Northeast Ridge (Bugaboo Spire), Snowpatch and Surf's Up (Snowpatch Spire) attract world-class climbers. There are both bolted and free routes throughout the group. Climbers and hikers often use the 40-person Conrad Kain hut, maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada. Located near Snowpatch Spire, the hut replaced the original fibreglass igloos placed by BC Parks. The Bugaboo Lodge, constructed in 1967, is near the eastern boundary of the park. Heli-skiing and heli-hiking are conducted from the lodge into the park. Ski touring is also popular in the group during the winter.

Biography Nixon was born in 1947 in Detroit, Michigan. Influenced by the photographs of Edward Weston and Walker Evans, he began working with large-format cameras. Whereas most professional photographers had abandoned these cameras in favor of shooting on 35 mm film with more portable cameras, Nixon preferred the format because it allowed prints to be made directly from the large format negatives, retaining the clarity and integrity of the image. Nixon has said \\"When photography went to the small camera and quick takes, it showed thinner and thinner slices of time, [unlike] early photography where time seemed non-changing. I like greater chunks, myself. Between 30 seconds and a thousand of a second the difference is very large.\\" His first solo exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art curated by John Szarkowski in 1976. Nixon‚Äôs early city views taken of Boston and New York in the mid-seventies were exhibited at one of the most influential exhibitions of the decade, New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape at the George Eastman House in 1975. In the late nineties, Nixon returned to this subject matter to document Boston‚Äôs changing urban landscape during the Big Dig highway development project. In 1976, 1980, and 1987, Nixon was awarded National Endowment for the Arts Photography Fellowships. In 1977 and 1986, he was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships. Nixon's subjects include schoolchildren and schools in and around Boston, people living along the Charles River near Boston and Cambridge as well as cities in the South, his family and himself, people in nursing homes, the blind, sick and dying people, and the intimacy of couples. Nixon is also well known for his work People With AIDS, begun in 1987. Nixon recorded his subjects with meticulous detail in order to facilitate a connection between the viewer and the subject. In 1975, Nixon began his project, The Brown Sisters consisting of a single portrait of his wife, Bebe, and her three sisters each year, consistently posed in the same left to right order. As of 2014, there are forty portraits altogether. The series has been shown at the St. Louis Art Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth the National Gallery of Art, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. In 2010, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston organized the exhibition \\"Nicholas Nixon: Family Album\\" which included \\"The Brown Sisters\\" series among other portraits of his wife Bebe, himself and his children Sam and Clementine. Nixon gained a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1969 and an M.F.A from the University of New Mexico in 1975. He worked as a part-time professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design from 1975 until March 2018. Allegations of inappropriate behavior On March 22, 2018, Nixon retired from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in mid-semester just after an investigation into alleged inappropriate behavior was announced. The investigation focuses on whether his conduct violated Title IX rules. The Boston Globe has also been investigating the professor since the beginning of 2018 for claims of sexual harassment interviewed more than a dozen former students who claimed the photographer asked undergraduate students to pose nude for him and made vulgar remarks in a classroom setting. On April 12, 2018, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston decided to close an exhibition of Nixon's photographs ten days early after the museum earlier said they would keep the exhibition on view following the report by the Boston Globe. The ICS also created an internet forum for patrons and staff to discuss the allegations, but closed the forum after a few days. Nixon asked the museum to cancel the exhibit immediately.

Part of the California State Park System, the beach lies just west of the intersection of California State Route 1 and State Route 84. Geography San Gregorio Creek widens to form a small freshwater lagoon in the park behind a sand berm, or barrier beach, which typically blocks the mouth of the creek, forcing the creekwaters to flow underfoot as they seep into the Pacific Ocean. During the rainy season the creek often cuts through the sand berm and flows directly into the ocean. Historically the creek was a coho salmon spawning site, and the Department of Fish and Game is considering restocking it with coho to improve the salmon fisheries south of San Francisco. It is one of the cleanest beaches in the state.Bay Area beaches grade well for safe swimming, May 27, 2010 by Carolyn Jones, San Francisco Chronicle Amenities Park facilities include restrooms and picnic tables. Dogs are not permitted on the beach, as it has been identified as an itinerant nesting habitat for the locally underpopulated western snowy plover. It is considered a self-registered fee area, although there is a kiosk which is staffed during summer months. North of the main beach is a nude beach on private property.

Linzer torte is a very short, crumbly pastry made of flour, unsalted butter, egg yolks, lemon zest, cinnamon and lemon juice, and ground nuts, usually hazelnuts, but even walnuts or almonds are used, covered with a filling of redcurrant, raspberry, or apricot preserves. Unlike most tortes, it is typically single layered like a pie or tart. It is covered by a lattice of thin dough strips placed atop the fruit. The pastry is brushed with lightly beaten egg whites, baked, and garnished with nuts. Linzer torte is a holiday treat in the Austrian, Hungarian, Swiss, German, and Tirolean traditions, often eaten at Christmas. Some North American bakeries offer Linzer torte as small tarts or as cookies Linzer cookies (, \\"Linzer eyes\\") or Linzer tarts are a sandwich cookie version, topped with a layer of dough with a characteristic circle shaped cut-out exposing the fruit preserves, and dusted with confectioner's sugar. History The Linzer torte is said to be the oldest cake ever to be named after a place. For a long time a recipe from 1696 in the Vienna Stadt- und Landesbibliothek was the oldest one known. In 2005, however, Waltraud Fai√üner, the library director of the Upper Austrian Landesmuseum and author of the book Wie mann die Linzer Dortten macht (\\"How to make the Linzer Torte\\"), found an even older Veronese recipe from 1653 in Codex 35/31 in the archive of Admont Abbey. The invention of the Linzer torte is subject of numerous legends, claiming either a Viennese confectioner named Linzer (as given by Alfred Polgar) or the Franconian pastry chef Johann Konrad Vogel (1796‚Äì1883), who started mass production of the cake in Linz around 1823. The Austrian migrant Franz H√∂lzlhuber claimed to have introduced the Linzer torte to Milwaukee in the 1850s. References Further reading * Marshall Faye: Now that's a Linzertorte. Stowe, Vt. 2007, .

Someone who is said to \\"live in cloud cuckoo land\\" is a person who thinks that things that are completely impossible might happen, rather than understanding how things really are. It also hints that the person referred to is naive, unaware of realities or deranged in holding such an optimistic belief. In the modern world, a \\"cloud cuckoo lander\\" is defined as someone who is seen as \\"crazy\\" or \\"strange\\" by most average people, often doing or saying things that seemingly only make sense to themselves, but also exhibit cleverness at times in ways no one else would think of.Cloudcuckoolander. Retrieved 30 September 2017. Cockaigne, the land of plenty in medieval myth, can be considered the predecessor to the modern day cloud cuckoo land. It was an imaginary place of extreme luxury and ease where physical comforts and pleasures were always immediately at hand and where the harshness of medieval peasant life did not exist. Literary sources Aristophanes, a Greek playwright, wrote and directed a drama The Birds, first performed in 414 BC, in which Pisthetaerus, a middle-aged Athenian persuades the world's birds to create a new city in the sky to be named Nubicuculia or Cloud Cuckoo Land (, '), thereby gaining control over all communications between men and gods. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer used the word (German ') in his publication On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason in 1813,On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason ¬ß 34, p. 133. as well as later in his main work The World as Will and RepresentationThe World as Will and Representation Vol. I, Part 4, ¬ß 53, p. 352. and in other places. Here, he gave it its figurative sense by reproaching other philosophers for only talking about Cloud-cuckoo-land. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche refers to the term in his essay \\"On Truth and Lying in a Nonmoral Sense.\\" Author Edward Crankshaw used the term when discussing the Deak-Andrassy Plan of 1867 in his 1963 book The Fall of the House of Habsburg (Chapter 13, \\"The Iron Ring of Fate\\"). Uses in politics The phrase has been used by British and United States politicians as well as writers. Margaret Thatcher famously used this phrase in the 1980s: \\"The ANC is a typical terrorist organisation... Anyone who thinks it is going to run the government in South Africa is living in cloud-cuckoo land.\\" Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's spokesman, who, when asked if the ANC might overthrow the government of South Africa by force, replied: \\"It is cloud-cuckoo land for anyone to believe that could be done\\". Ann Widdecombe, British MP used the phrase in a debate on drug prohibition with a representative of Transform Drug Policy Foundation: \\"...it is cloud cuckoo land to suggest that [people who don't currently use heroin would not start using it if it became legal]\\". Newt Gingrich referred to Barack Obama's claim that algae could be used as a fuel source as cloud cuckoo land. Henry A. Wallace, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (later U.S. Vice President in Franklin D. Roosevelt's third term) used the term to describe the unrealistically inflated value of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange just before the crash of 1929 that signaled the onset of the Great Depression. In his 1936 book, Whose Constitution? An Inquiry into the General Welfare, Wallace describes a cartoon in a popular weekly magazine which \\"pictured an airplane in an endurance flight refueling in mid-air, and made fun of the old fashioned economist down below who was saying it couldn't be done. The economic aeroplane was to keep on gaining elevation indefinitely, with the millennium just around a cloud\\" (p. 75). Wallace wrote that Wall Street's practice of lending money to Europe after World War I \\"to pay interest on the [war reparations] debts she owed us and to buy the products we wanted to sell her ... was the international refueling device that for 12 years kept our economic aeroplane above the towering peaks of our credit structure and the massive wall of our tariff, in Cloud-Cuckoo Land\\". Paul Krugman used the phrase referring to inadequate German economic politics toward failing members of the European Union: \\"Basically, it seems that even as the euro approaches a critical juncture, senior German officials are living in Wolkenkuckucksheim‚Äîcloud-cuckoo land.\\" (June 9, 2012). Yuri N. Maltsev, an Austrian economist and economic historian,Yuri N. Maltsev. Mises Institute. Retrieved 30 September 2017. uses the term to describe the lack of promised results in the communist states in his forward to 1920 essay by Ludwig von Mises: \\"Today, the disastrous consequences of enforcing the utopia on the unfortunate populations of the communist states are clear even to their leaders. As Mises predicted, despite the cloud-cuckoo lands of their fancy, roasted pigeons failed to fly into the mouths of the comrades.\\" Other uses The phrase has been used in poetry, music, film and by writers. Cloudcuckooland, a poetry collection by Simon Armitage. Cloudcuckooland, the first album by the Lightning Seeds, released in 1990. In 2002, electronic music producer Sasha released a track called \\"Cloud Cuckoo\\" on his album Airdrawndagger. Cloud Cuckooland is the name of the eighth world found in the video game Banjo-Tooie. Cloud Cuckoo Land is the name of a magical realm, hidden inside a cloud featured in The Lego Movie. Radiohead uses the term in the lyrics of their song Like Spinning Plates. Publisher and editor Gary Groth uses the term in the title of his review of Scott McCloud's book Reinventing Comics. Cloud Cuckoo Land has been used as a stand-in for Hollywood as in Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm. Dorothy Sayers, in the Author‚Äôs Note to her novel Gaudy Night (1936), explains that the story, while set in Oxford, is entirely fictitious, concluding that ‚Äú...the novelist‚Äôs only native country is Cloud-Cuckooland, where they do but jest, poison in jest: no offense in the world.‚Äù (The final words are a reference to Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 2.) ‚ÄúMagical Christmas Land‚Äù is a slang term frequently used by players of the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering that appears to be synonymous with Cloud Cuckoo Land.

The canal is part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Located in Beauharnois-Salaberry Regional County Municipality within the cities of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Beauharnois, Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, and Saint-Stanislas-de-Kostka, the canal connects Lake Saint-Francis to the west (upstream) with Lake Saint-Louis to the northeast (downstream), bypassing a series of rapids on the Saint Lawrence River. History Construction on Beauharnois Canal in 1930 The original Beauharnois Canal opened in 1843, and measured 15 nmi () in length and was built on the south side of the St. Lawrence River. It replaced the Coteau-du- Lac canal. The canal became obsolete and was superseded by the Soulanges Canal in 1899 which ran on the north side of the St. Lawrence River. The present Beauharnois Canal was built between 1929-1932 on the south side of the St. Lawrence River, measuring in length, with a minimum depth of and width of . This canal was built as part of a hydroelectric development at Beauharnois which saw a dam and power house built to take advantage of the drop between Lake St. Francis and Lake St. Louis. Some of the electricity is used to power a large aluminum smelter in Beauharnois. In the 1950s, the Beauharnois Canal had 2 locks added as part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway project, which were inaugurated in 1959. This in turn superseded the Soulanges Canal. The locks enable ships up to 27,000 tons to travel between the two lakes.

Along with Stanis≈Çaw Wigura, he won the international air contest Challenge 1932. He was born in Sventiany, near Vilnius in Lithuania (at that time part of the Russian Empire) and attended school in Vilnius. During World War I, he volunteered for the Russian Army, graduated from an officer school in Irkutsk, and served in infantry, fighting against the Germans. He was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 4th class. In 1917, he joined the Polish corps of Gen. J√≥zef Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki, formed in Russia. After the corps was disbanded in 1918, he enlisted in Gen. Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. He completed an air observer course. After the Bolsheviks' victory in the war in 1921, ≈ªwirko fought his way to Poland across the Soviet-Polish border. In Poland, he completed an aviation school in Bydgoszcz in November 1923, and a higher pilotage school in GrudziƒÖdz. He became a fighter pilot in the 18th Fighter Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment, with a rank of porucznik pilot (flying lieutenant). He also became active in sports aviation. ≈ªwirko distinguished himself as a very skilled and calm pilot. In August 1927, flying a Breguet 19 military plane, he took the 2nd place in the 1st air contest of the Little Entente and Poland in Yugoslavia, and the 1st place in its rally part. From 1929 he was assigned as a liaison officer in the University Aeroclub (Aeroklub Akademicki) in Warsaw. Thanks to his new post, he could increase his sporting activity, meeting young aviation enthusiasts - mostly students of Warsaw University of Technology. He especially made friends with young engineer Stanislaw Wigura, one of the designers of the RWD team. They often flew together from then, Wigura as a mechanic and second pilot. Between 9 August and 6 September 1929, ≈ªwirko and Wigura flew the RWD-2 prototype across Europe, on Warsaw-Paris- Barcelona‚ÄìMilano‚ÄìWarsaw 5000 km route, and on October 6 they won in the 1st Rally of South-Eastern Poland. On October 16, 1929, ≈ªwirko and Antoni Kocjan set an international FAI altitude record of 4,004 m (13,136 ft) in the light tourist plane class (below 280 kg or 616 lb empty weight) on that plane. Symbolic grave of ≈ªwirko in Cierlicko, in the place of his fatal crash. In July 1930, ≈ªwirko and Wigura took part in the International Tourist Plane Competition Challenge 1930, flying the RWD-4, but they had to withdraw on July 25 due to engine failure, after an emergency landing in Spain. In September and October 1930, they won two contests in Poland (the 2nd Rally of South- Eastern Poland flying RWD-2 and the 3rd Light Aircraft Contest, flying RWD-4), and in October 1931 they won the 4th Touring Planes Contest, flying on a prototype RWD-5. On August 7, 1931, ≈ªwirko and Stanis≈Çaw Prauss tried to break another altitude record, on RWD-7, climbing at 5,996 m (19,672 ft), but it was not recognized by the FAI due to a non-standard recording device. In December 1931, ≈ªwirko was assigned a training escadre commander in an aviation school in Dƒôblin. In April 1932 he was selected for the Polish team for the International Tourist Plane Competition Challenge 1932, taking place between August 20-August 28, 1932, and he chose Wigura as his crewmate. They won the competition, over favourite German and other teams, flying the new RWD-6, and became heroes in Poland. The success was brought by ≈ªwirko's pilotage skills and high quality of the plane, designed among others, by Wigura. On 11 September 1932, flying to an air meeting to Prague, ≈ªwirko and Wigura fatally crashed in their RWD-6 in the forest at Cierlicko near Cieszyn in Czechoslovakia, when the wing broke in a heavy storm. The two men were buried in the Avenue of the Meritorious in PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw. Honours and awards On 14 September 1932, the President of Poland posthumously awarded ≈ªwirko the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta \\"for his contribution in the field of propaganda in the international aviation\\" and, on March 12, 1933, he received a posthumous promotion to the captain with seniority from 1 January 1933.

Coeducation was not revived at the College for another 182 years.\\" In July 1789, Franklin College ran into financial difficulty as its annual tuition of four pounds was not enough to cover operating costs. Enrollment began to dwindle to just a few students and eventually the college existed as nothing more than an annual meeting of the Board of Trustees. In an effort to help the ailing school, an academy was established in 1807. For the next three decades, Franklin College and Franklin Academy managed to limp along financially, with instructors supplementing their income with private tutoring. =Marshall College (19th century)= Having grown from a Reformed Church academy, Marshall College opened in 1836 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. The school was named for the fourth Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, who had died the previous year. It was founded with the belief that harmony between knowledge and will was necessary to create a well-rounded person. During its first year, 18 students were taught by Frederick Augustus Rauch and his assistant, Samuel A. Budd. Rauch, an acclaimed young scholar and theologian from Germany who authored the first American textbook in psychology, also served as the college's president. The school's small but brilliant faculty grew in both size and status with the addition of John Williamson Nevin and another German scholar, church historian Philip Schaff. Nevin became the college's president upon Rauch's sudden death in 1841. Life at Marshall College was well- regimented. Students were required to attend morning prayers‚Äîsometimes as early as 5 a.m.‚Äîand were expected to study in their rooms for six hours a day. In addition, they were forbidden to associate with people of questionable moral character. Marshall College quickly gained national recognition and attracted students from a large geographical area, with some coming as far away as the West Indies. However, despite being initially well-funded, Marshall College began to experience financial difficulties of its own. By the late 1840s, financial support and enthusiasm among the local community had virtually disappeared and the school was in danger of closing its doors for good. In 1835, the school's Debating Society was renamed Diagnothian Literary Society at the suggestion of seminary student Samuel Reed Fisher. That June, Diagnothian was divided into two friendly rivals to encourage debate. Diagnothian retained its original name, while the new society was named Goethean, in honor of German philosopher and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The two organizations sponsored orations and debated politics, philosophy and literature. They merged in 1955, but became separate entities again in 1989. The Diagnothian Society is the oldest student organization on campus. =Merger= On December 6, 1849, Franklin College and Marshall College began to explore the possibility of a merger as a method to secure the future of both institutions. Three years later, on June 7, 1853, the combined college was formally dedicated at Lancaster's Fulton Hall. The merger created an all- male Reformed Church institution that combined the resources of both schools. James Buchanan, four years shy of becoming the 15th President of the United States, was named president of the first Franklin & Marshall board of trustees. The college's first two presidents, Emanuel Vogel Gerhart, a Marshall College graduate, and Nevin struggled to keep the young school afloat with an inadequate endowment. The hope of creating a reputable liberal arts institution fueled their efforts to push on. \\"No second- or third-rate school will do,\\" said Nevin at the formal dedication of the united college. \\"We must either have no college at all or else have one that may be in all respects worthy of the name.\\" The citizens of Lancaster agreed to donate $25,000 towards the construction of a building for the new college. A site on the east end of the city was proposed near where the new Lancaster County Prison was constructed in 1851. Two parallel streets in the area were renamed, one for Franklin and one for Marshall. However, Buchanan ultimately rejected this idea saying \\"I do not think the best location for a literary institution should be between a court house and a jail.\\" Instead, Buchanan and the board selected a site at the northwestern end of Lancaster. Known locally as \\"Gallows Hill,\\" it was the former site of Lancaster's public executions and the highest point of ground in city. At the laying of the building's cornerstone in 1853, Henry Harbaugh, a Marshall College graduate and pastor of the Reformed Church of Lancaster noted that the city's lowest point was the prison. Harbaugh stated: \\"Thank God! The College stands higher than the jail. Education should be lifted up and let crime sink to the lowest depths!\\" The distinctive, tall- towered structure, designed in the Gothic Revival style, was dedicated on May 16, 1856, as \\"Recitation Hall.\\" Recitation Hall came to be known as \\"Old Main\\" and the ground as \\"College Hill\\". Franklin and Marshall College took as its motto the Latin phrase Lux et Lex, which translates in English to \\"Light and Law\\". This was the reverse of the Marshall College motto Lex et Lux. While legend has it that the switch was the result of an error by an engraver, it was more likely a deliberate decision to pair the words with its namesakes Benjamin Franklin (\\"light\\") and John Marshall (\\"law\\"). The college seal depicts the profiles of Franklin and Marshall, both looking to the left. It has been often suggested that this represented the two leaders looking westward towards the (then) future expansion of the United States. Despite the fact that his name comes second, John Marshall is shown on the left of the seal and Benjamin Franklin is on the right. But Franklin's full head is shown, while Marshall's profile is cut off and far in the background. Some say that this shows the college's unspoken tendency to favor Franklin's legacy over Marshall's. Recently this preference became more than simply unspoken, as the school actively promoted recognition of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday while ignoring John Marshall's 250th birthday, which occurred during consecutive semesters of the 2005-2006 academic year. The school recognized Marshall's milestone birthday only after a petition was circulated by then seniors Ryan Corbalis and Patrick Godfrey and signed by a significant portion of the students and faculty of the college. Old Main, Goethean Hall, and Diagnothian Hall were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. =Late 19th century= In 1872, the Franklin and Marshall Academy, an all-male prep school, opened on campus. When it closed in 1943, it was the last prep school in America to be directly affiliated with a private college or university. The academy's first building, East Hall, was constructed in 1872. A second and larger building, Hartman Hall, replaced it in 1907. Both buildings were used by the college for various purposes after the academy folded. Hartman Hall was demolished in 1975 and East Hall followed in 1978. College Days, the first student newspaper, began publication in 1873. Later student newspapers included The College Student (1881‚Äì1914), The F&M; Weekly (1891‚Äì1915), The Student Weekly (1915‚Äì1964), The Blue and The White (1990‚Äì1992), and The College Reporter (1964‚Äìpresent). Oriflamme, the Franklin and Marshall College yearbook, was established in 1883. In 1887, the centennial celebration of Franklin College was held at the school. By then, over 100 students were enrolled at F&M.; 1899 saw the formation of the college's first theatre group, the Franklin & Marshall Dramatic Association. The next year, it was renamed the Green Room Club. The club performed plays at Lancaster's Fulton Opera House. Because the college admitted only men, the female roles were played by local actresses. In 1937, the Green Room Theatre opened on campus. F&M; alumni who have performed on the Green Room stage include Oscar-winning film director Franklin J. Schaffner and actors Roy Scheider and Treat Williams. =20th century= Old Main, Franklin & Marshall College, c. 1910 The college began a rapid period of growth after World War I. Enrollment rose from around 300 students in 1920, to over 750 by 1930. In 1924, the architectural firm of Klauder and Day presented a master campus plan in the Colonial Revival style. Dietz-Santee dormitory, Meyran-Franklin dormitory, the Mayser Physical Education Center, and Hensel Hall were all completed within three years. Two additional dormitories were planned at that time, but never constructed. The sesquicentennial celebration of Franklin College was held in mid-October 1937. Student enrollment at that time was 800. A commemorative plaque celebrating the sesquicentennial of Franklin College and the signing of the United States Constitution was presented to the college by the Lancaster County Historical Society. In 1939, the school began an aviation program in the new Keiper Liberal Arts Building. The Aeronautical Laboratory eventually became a government-sponsored flight school with 40 faculty members. Two airplanes were disassembled, moved into the building and reassembled on the third floor where they were used as flight simulators. During World War II, Franklin and Marshall College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. By 1945, with the majority of young men fighting in World War II, the college population dwindled to just under 500 students and 28 faculty members. The end of the war brought many new students who decided to pursue their education under the G.I. Bill. By 1946, enrollment had swelled to over 1,200 students (including four women permitted to study in the pre-med program), and there was a sudden critical shortage of faculty members. The 1950s and 1960s brought more college expansion and construction, including North Museum (1953); Marshall-Buchanan Residence Hall (1956), Appel Infirmary (1959), Schnader Residence Hall (1959), Mayser Physical Education Center (1962), Benjamin Franklin Residence Halls (1964), Pfeiffer Science Complex (now Hackman Physical Science Laboratory) (1967), Grundy Observatory (1967), Whitely Psychology Laboratory (1968), and Thomas Residence Hall (1968). Like other academic institutions in the 1960s, Franklin and Marshall experienced during the decade a series of student protests that were based on important social issues, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. In April 1961, students rioted in front of the President's house and Hensel Hall, burning effigies and college property in protest of administration policies. Martin Luther King Jr. visited the campus on December 12, 1963, just three weeks after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and spoke about civil rights before an over-capacity audience of more than 4,000 in Mayser Center, the school's gymnasium. In 1965 Robert Mezey, a 30-year-old visiting English instructor and poet, spoke on campus against the Vietnam War, and traveled to Washington, DC to march against the conflict. When someone accused him of urging students to burn their draft cards, he was suspended with pay for a month while the college investigated. The incident caused widespread controversy in the local press, with some residents ordering him to \\"get the hell out of Lancaster\\" and \\"go to Russia.\\" Though Mezey was later reinstated, he left the college the following spring. This became known as the \\"Mezey Affair.\\" In the spring of 1969, black students protested the final examination of the history course \\"The Black Experience in America.\\" Demanding an apology from the faculty for exploitation and an \\"A\\" in the course, the students argued that no white man can test them on their \\"blackness.\\" The day before the exam, the professors agreed to the apology, but still insisted that the students take the final exam. On May 22, the day of the exam, 40 black students‚Äîmany of whom were not enrolled in the course‚Äîblocked the entrance to the exam room in Old Main. The professors attempted to hand out the exam to the other students in the class, but the protesters confiscated them. Retreating to Goethean Hall next door, the professors and staff met to evaluate the situation. The protesters followed them to the building, blocked all doors and exits and held them hostage, declaring that they would not release the faculty members until they received an apology and immunity from punishment. The standoff lasted until midnight, when the professors agreed to allow the students to grade themselves. The students relented and released the hostages. However the college's Professional Standards Committee later overturned the decision, declaring that the professors would, in fact, have to grade the students after all. In 1969, Franklin and Marshall College ended its formal affiliation with the United Church of Christ, becoming a secular school. Franklin College enrolled female students during its first few years in the eighteenth century, but it was an academy for teenagers. Franklin and Marshall College was an all-male institution. Women were permitted to attend summer school classes at F&M; beginning in 1942. Continuing a trend in single-sex schools across the country, the Board of Trustees announced on January 17, 1969, that it had voted to admit women to F&M;, a decision that was supported by male students. In the fall of 1969, 82 freshman women and 34 female transfer students were enrolled in F&M;'s first coeducational class. In 1970, F&M; students protested the administration's failure to rehire popular sociology instructor Anthony Lazroe and history instructor Henry Mayer. The protest, known as the \\"Lazroe- Mayer incident,\\" culminated in the East Hall sit-in on April 30, where students took over the building for several hours. On September 17, 1970, the Herman Art Center (named after Jacob Leon Herman, Class of 1916) was dedicated as part of Convocation, during which painter Jim Dine and sculptor Chaim Gross were awarded honorary degrees. The building was designed by Fisher, Nes and Campbell of Baltimore, MD, for the studio art program, but, unfortunately, only half of the original plan was ever constructed due to lack of funds. In 1976, the Steinman College Center was constructed. The building‚Äîdesigned by Minoru Yamasaki, architect of New York's World Trade Center‚Äîoriginally housed the campus bookstore. Today it houses the College Reporter, the Oriflamme Yearbook, the College Entertainment Committee, the Phillips Museum of Art, Pandini's (a restaurant), the campus radio station WFNM, and a post office. On April 29, 1976, the Green Room Theatre staged the world premiere of the John Updike play Buchanan Dying, about former President James Buchanan, a Lancaster resident and former President of the Board of Trustees. The production was directed by Edward S. Brubaker and starred Peter Vogt, an F&M; alumnus. After the premiere, a reception was held at Wheatland, Buchanan's Lancaster residence. On March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in nearby Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, experienced a partial meltdown, forcing the college to close for a short time. The 1980s were a prosperous time for the college. Construction projects initiated during the decade included Hartman Green (1982); French House (1984); Murray Arts House (1984); Ice Rink (1984); Spaulding Plaza (1985); the Other Room Theatre (1985); major renovations and expansions of Fackenthal Library (1983, renamed Shadek-Fackenthal Library), which currently houses approximately 513,942 volumes; Stahr Hall (1985, renamed Stager Hall, 1988); the Black Cultural Center (1986); and Weis Residence Hall (1989). On June 6, 1987, Franklin and Marshall College celebrated its bicentennial. The 1990s brought a major expansion to the north side of campus with the construction of College Square in 1991. The multi-use complex houses a new bookstore, laundromat, video store, restaurants and a food court. Other buildings from the decade include International House (1990), Martin Library of the Sciences (1990) (which currently houses approximately 61,170 volumes), and the Alumni Sports and Fitness Center (1995). =21st century= Around the start of the 21st century, the college continued to grow with the addition of the Barshinger Center for Musical Arts in Hensel Hall (2000); President's House (built 1933; purchased by the college in 2002); Roschel Performing Arts Center (2003); Writer's House (2004); College Row Apartments (2007) which included apartment style living for upper- classmen with retail space on ground floors; the newly renovated Klehr Center for Jewish life (2008); and a new academic building for Life Sciences and Philosophy, the Ann & Richard Barshinger Life Sciences & Philosophy Building (2007). In 2003, the National Park Service created the Franklin and Marshall College Campus Historic District, listing 14 buildings (including Old Main, Goethean Hall, and Diagnothian Hall, previously listed in 1975) and three architectural features. On January 19, 2006, the college celebrated the tricentennial of Benjamin Franklin's birth. Among other activities, noted Franklin scholar Walter Issacson gave a lecture, and a full-page ad praising Franklin and advertising the college was purchased in The New York Times. On March 10, 2010, it was announced that then current president John Fry would be leaving the college to become the president of Drexel University on August 1, 2010. The college began its search for a new president for the fall semester immediately. Alumnus John Burness took a one-year leave from his job at Duke University as senior vice president for public affairs and government relations to head the college as interim president. On November 16, 2010, it was announced that Daniel R. Porterfield would become the new president of the college, effective March 1, 2011. Porterfield came to F&M; from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he served as a senior vice president. He is the 15th president in the college's history.F&M; Names New President ‚Äì Pennsylvania News Story ‚Äì WGAL The Susquehanna Valley . Wgal.com (2010-11-16). Retrieved on 2010-12-10. Since 2011 hundreds of talented, underserved high school students from across the country have taken part in F&M; College Prep, a summer immersion program that offers an introduction to all aspects of college life. Each of these participants have gone on to college, and more than 90% have gone on to enroll at four-year colleges, including Harvard, Brown, Stanford, Georgetown, and Bucknell universities, the University of Texas-Austin, Pomona College, Trinity College, Spelman College, and Franklin & Marshall. The Office of Student and Post-Graduate Development‚Äîwhich offers life skills workshops, job-search boot camps for seniors and recent grads, more on-campus recruiting and more programming for alumni‚Äîopened in 2012 and enjoys wide support from students and alumni. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded F&M; a $700,000 grant for its Faculty Center, which was launched in 2013 to improve support for faculty in their roles as researchers and educators. On May 1, 2014 Franklin & Marshall College was named as one of the 55 colleges by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights under review or investigation for their policies or practices for handling sexual assault reports. Prior to the public announcement, President Porterfield sent an email to address the impending OCR \\"fact-finding investigation.\\" =Presidents= Franklin College: *Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1787‚Äì1815) *Operated as an academy by Board of Trustees (1816‚Äì1853) Marshall College: *Frederick Augustus Rauch (1836‚Äì1841) *The Rev.

Many of the teams compete in the Centennial Conference. Men's intercollegiate competition is in fourteen sports: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, squash, swimming, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, wrestling, and rowing. Women's intercollegiate competition is in fourteen sports: basketball, rowing, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, squash, swimming, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, and volleyball. F&M; competes in NCAA Division III for all varsity sports except wrestling, which is Division I, and men's and women's squash, which are nondivisional. The wrestling program competes for the Rupp Cup against local rival Millersville University. In 1866, the student-run Alpha Club sponsored the college's first baseball game. In 1887, the first football team was organized by Seminary student Miles O. Noll. Franklin and Marshall College was defeated 9‚Äì0 by the York YMCA. Later that year, the program played a re-match and lost again, this time by score of 6‚Äì4. Frank Mount Pleasant became the head football coach in 1910. Distler House, the school's first gymnasium, was constructed in 1891 and contained a bowling alley, indoor running track, and gymnastic equipment. Sponaugle-Williamson Field was constructed in 1895 with the assistance of $1,500 from Henry S. Williamson. It was later renamed \\"Williamson Field.\\" A concrete grandstand was added in 1922 at a cost of $10,000. In 1900 the first basketball game was played. The opposing team was Millersville Normal School. Professor Charles W. Mayser founded the F&M; wrestling team in 1923, and early 1924 saw the college's first wrestling match as the Blue & White defeated Western Maryland College 24‚Äì5. The Diplomat grapplers finished their maiden season with a 4‚Äì1 record. F&M; wrestling competes in the EIWA and is the only Division III school to compete in Division I wrestling. Mayser Physical Education Center, the college's second gymnasium, was opened in 1927. In 1992, F&M; became a charter member of the Centennial Conference, an athletic conference of 11 mid-Atlantic institutions that compete in 22 sports in the NCAA's Division III. The other founding members of the conference are Bryn Mawr College, Dickinson College, Gettysburg College, Haverford College, Johns Hopkins University, Muhlenberg College, Swarthmore College, Ursinus College, Western Maryland College, (renamed McDaniel College) and Washington College. In 1995, the Alumni Sports and Fitness Center, the school's third gymnasium, opened on the site of the college's former ice rink. In 2007, the F&M; women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Division III championship with an undefeated season record of 21‚Äì0. The women's lacrosse team took back the NCAA Division III championship in 2009, for the second time in three years with a 21‚Äì1 record. It marked the third consecutive year that the women's lacrosse team played in the championship game. The men's basketball team has reached the NCAA Division III Final Four on five occasions (1979, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2009), appearing in the national championship game in 1991. The men's basketball team has been nationally ranked on a frequent basis since the late 1970s, including No. 1 in Division III at some point during seven different seasons. Head coach Glenn Robinson is the career leader in wins in Division III. Robinson has been listed as one of the top 100 college basketball coaches of all-time. Other successful athletic teams at F&M; include men's soccer, men's and women's swimming, baseball, and squash. They all traditionally compete for conference championships and have been ranked high nationally. In 2008, the men's swimming team won the Centennial Conference championships and the women's swimming team placed second. At that championship, Thomas Anthony Grabiak Jr. of F&M; set Centennial Conference championship meet records in the 100 and 200 yd breaststroke events. Men's squash consistently maintains a Top-10 Division I national ranking, having finished No. 8 in the past two seasons. In 1988, the men's lacrosse team finished the season 13-3 and played all the way until the USILA national semifinals. =Club sports= F&M; also boasts several student-run clubs, most notably men's and women's rugby, both of which have become serious contenders for regional, and national championships each season and which compete in the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union. Ultimate frisbee is also a popular club sport on campus, fielding both a men's and a women's team. In 2009, the college water polo team was revived and currently competes in the American Water Polo League and the Collegiate Water Polo League. =Sponaugle‚ÄìWilliamson Field= Sponaugle‚ÄìWilliamson Field is a stadium for the outdoor athletic teams of the college. It was built in 1920 as Williamson Field, named after S. Woodrow Sponaugle, who coached football and basketball and was the athletic director at F&M; for 15 years. He shares the stadium's dedication with Henry S. Williamson, who was a trustee of the college from 1894 to 1917. =Shadek Stadium= Shadek Stadium is used for football and lacrosse. Construction began in the fall of 2016 and ended in the fall of 2017. The stadium was named after the Shadeck family, a family prominent at the school. The turf field in the stadium, Gilburg Field, is named after football player and former F&M; coach Tom Gilburg. In the first football game played in the stadium, the Diplomats defeated Centennial Conference rivals Dickinson College 56-0. Greek system Chi Phi, founded on December 1, 1854, remains the only fraternity at F&M; with a fraternity house actually on the campus grounds. In 1929, through a special lease agreement with the college, the chapter built its house at 603 Race Avenue. The house was dedicated and opened in 1929, during the chapter's 75th anniversary celebration. During World War II, with school and fraternity attendance down, the house was converted to a temporary infirmary. In 1998, due to a series of disagreements with the college, the lease was terminated and the fraternity was evicted. On February 7, 2001, after three years, Chi Phi renegotiated a new lease with F&M.; They reoccupied the house the following August. In 1978, the school's first sorority, Sigma Sigma Sigma, was chartered. In 2005, the chapter became inactive. In April 1988, the College's Board of Trustees voted to no longer officially recognize the school's fraternities and sororities. This was known as \\"derecognition.\\" At the time, three of the school's fraternities had recently lost their national charters due to various offenses. In an effort to repair the system, the college administration proposed eight specific reforms to the Greek Council, which were ultimately rejected by all of the organizations. The result was derecognition. This was highly unpopular with the student body, but it served to remove the college from any liability associated with hazing and underage alcohol abuse, issues that were in the national public eye at that time. The Greek system continued, albeit without financial or administrative support from the college. After several years, a small number of fraternities struggled with health code violations, fires, and one accidental alcohol-related death. Owing to several factors, including dwindling financial support from fraternity and sorority alumni and legitimate concerns about student academics, health and safety, the college announced on May 19, 2004, that it would reinstate a new, revised Greek system beginning on September 1, 2004, after a 16-year absence. As part of the new agreement between the school's Greek organizations and the administration, fraternity and sorority houses are required to submit to weekly \\"life safety\\" inspections by school officials, and inspections by the local fire department, police department, and office of public health conducted once per semester. An Inter- Fraternity Council consisting of representatives from all fraternities and advised by a member of the faculty, as well as a Greek Council consisting of members of all Greek organizations (male and female), similarly advised by a faculty member, were re-established to deal with issues facing the Greek community and advising the administration on Greek issues. As recently as the fall of 2008, relations between the administration and the Greek system were strained. The administration placed a month-long moratorium on all Greek social events. During this period, the Interfraternity Council revised protocols governing parties, and the revisions were approved by the administration resulting in the lifting of the moratorium, but the administration committed to more sternly enforcing the newly agreed-upon rules. There were also tensions between some members of the Greek system and Lancaster City, arising chiefly from incidents of crime. Concerns over the condition of Greek housing has led the administration and Greek organizations to examine different possibilities for improving the quality of housing options in order for such houses to receive continued support and approval from the college. In some cases, the result has been the temporary closure of Greek housing until the buildings can be brought up to school and town safety standards. Greek life is a major part of F&M;'s community. As of the spring of 2014, 43.7% of the F&M; student body are members of the Greek Community. =List of fraternities= * ŒßŒ¶ Chi Phi, Zeta Chapter, fall of 1854 (currently inactive) * Œ¶ŒöŒ£ Phi Kappa Sigma, Zeta Chapter, October 13, 1854 * Œ¶ŒöŒ® Phi Kappa Psi, Penn Eta Chapter, 1860 :* ŒîŒ§Œî Delta Tau Delta, Tau Prime Chapter, 1874‚Äì1895 (currently inactive) :* Œ¶Œ£Œö Phi Sigma Kappa, Pi Chapter, 1903‚Äì1983 (currently inactive) :* ŒîŒ£Œ¶ Delta Sigma Phi, Upsilon Chapter, 1915‚Äì2015 (currently inactive) :* ŒõŒßŒë Lambda Chi Alpha, Alpha Theta Chapter, 1917‚Äì1980 (currently inactive) :* Œ£Œ† Sigma Pi, Nu Chapter, 1918-2017 (currently inactive) * Œ¶ŒöŒ§ Phi Kappa Tau, Xi Chapter, 1921 (currently inactive) * ŒöŒ£ Kappa Sigma, Delta Rho Chapter, 1929 * ŒñŒíŒ§ Zeta Beta Tau, Alpha Tau Chapter, 1931‚Äì1988, existed as Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Chapter, 1996-1998, ZBT 2016‚Äìpresent :* Œ†ŒõŒ¶ Pi Lambda Phi, Tau Chapter, 1947, (currently inactive) * Œ¶Œ£Œ† Phi Sigma Pi, Zeta Beta Chapter, 2010 =List of sororities= * ŒëŒ¶ Alpha Phi, Zeta Sigma Chapter, 1982-19xx, 2008 * ŒëŒîŒ† Alpha Delta Pi, Theta Lambda Chapter, 2011 * ŒëŒûŒî Alpha Xi Delta, Iota Psi Chapter, 2014 * ŒßŒ© Chi Omega, Phi Lambda Chapter, 1987 * ŒöŒî Kappa Delta, Eta Lambda Chapter, 2008 :* ŒöŒíŒì Kappa Beta Gamma, Nu Chapter, 2002‚Äì2008, currently inactive :* Œ£Œ£Œ£ Sigma Sigma Sigma, Delta Nu Chapter, 1978‚Äì2005, currently inactive * ŒîŒ£Œò Delta Sigma Theta, Lambda Gamma, 2017 * Œ£ŒõŒì Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority Inc., 2019 Notable alumni Notable alumni of Franklin & Marshall College include Edwin R.

Clothing company In 1999, a company based in Verona, Italy began producing items of clothing in a vintage 1950s collegiate-style with the words \\"Franklin and Marshall\\" on them. F&M; alumni began to report seeing F&M; merchandise for sale in Europe, which puzzled the college. In 2001, Tim McGraw posed for publicity photos wearing a \\"Franklin Marshall Wrestling\\" T-shirt, one of which was included in the CD booklet for his album Set This Circus Down. When many asked Franklin & Marshall College about its nonexistent connection to the singer, the college investigated and discovered that the Franklin Marshall Clothing company was using its name without permission. In 2003, the college licensed the name to the company so it could sell its products, many of which omit Franklin & Marshall's ampersand, in the United States. The clothing company has stated in news reports that its designs are \\"inspired by the American Vintage College spirit, as exemplified by Franklin & Marshall College.\\" Most of its products are made in Italy and are much more expensive than the Champion-produced licensed apparel sold by the college's bookstore. the company has stores in six cities: Athens, Dubai, Milan, Tokyo, and Paris, and also sells through high-end stores like Harrods in Britain. Although it no longer sells its products in the United States due to poor sales, in 2010 the company pledged to donate $130,000 to the college's scholarship fund. In 2013 Franklin & Marshall became a sponsor of Hellas Verona, a football (soccer) team in the Italian Serie A.

The regiment saw service in the Second Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korean War. In 1968 the Royal Ulster Rifles was amalgamated with the other regiments of the North Irish Brigade, the Royal Irish Fusiliers (Princess Victoria's), and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers to create the Royal Irish Rangers. History =Early years= Monument to the men of the Royal Irish Rifles who died in the Second Boer War in the grounds of Belfast City Hall The regiment's history dates backs to the reign of King George III. In 1793 the British Army expanded to meet the commitments of the war with the French First Republic. As part of that expansion it raised two new regiments of foot, the 83rd and the 86th. In 1881, under the Childers Reforms, the 83rd and 86th were amalgamated into a single regiment, named the Royal Irish Rifles, one of eight infantry regiments raised and garrisoned in Ireland. It was the county regiment of Antrim, Down, Belfast and Louth, with its depot located at Victoria Barracks, Belfast. Militarily, the whole of Ireland was administered as a single command within the United Kingdom with Command Headquarters at Parkgate (Phoenix Park) Dublin, directly under the War Office in London.Harris, pp. 2‚Äì3 The regiment suffered serious losses at the Battle of Stormberg in December 1899 during the Second Boer War. In October 1905, a memorial was erected in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in memory of the 132 who did not return. Field Marshal Lord Grenfell unveiled the memorial while the Times reported the event. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had three Reserve but no Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), the 4th Battalion (Special Reserve) and the 5th Battalion (Special Reserve). =First World War= Infantry of the Royal Irish Rifles during the Battle of the Somme in the First World War Regular Army The 1st Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 25th Brigade in the 8th Division in November 1914 for service on the Western Front. It saw action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915,Roe, p. 23 the Battle of Fromelles in July 1915 and the Battle of Loos in September 1915 before taking part in the Battle of the Somme in September 1916.Roe, p. 24 The 2nd Battalion landed at Rouen as part of the 7th Brigade in the 3rd Division in August 1914 and in the remainder of that year saw action at the Battle of Mons, Battle of Le Cateau, First Battle of the Marne, First Battle of the Aisne, Battle of La Bass√©e and the Battle of Messines. By September 1914, only 6 officers and 200 men of the Battalion's original 1,100 men were still in active service. By October the battalion had been further reduced to two officers and 46 men and by the end of 1914, 97 per cent of the original battalion had been killed, injured or taken prisoner. New Armies pioneer battalion of the 36th (Ulster) Division, moving to the frontline 20 November 1917. The 6th (Service) Battalion landed at Anzac Cove as part of the 29th Brigade in the 10th (Irish) Division in August 1915 but moved to Salonika in October 1915 and to Egypt for service in Palestine in September 1917. The 7th (Service) Battalion, which absorbed a company of the Royal Jersey Militia, landed at Le Havre as part of the 48th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion (East Belfast), 9th (Service) Battalion (West Belfast) and 10th (Service) Battalion (South Belfast) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 107th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 11th (Service) Battalion (South Antrim), 12th (Service) Battalion (Central Antrim) and 13th (Service) Battalion (1st County Down) landed at Boulogne-sur- Mer as part of the 108th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 14th (Service) Battalion (Young Citizens) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 109th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 15th (Service) Battalion (North Belfast) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 107th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 16th (Service) Battalion (2nd County Down) (Pioneers) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as pioneer battalion for the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. Some 7,010 soldiers from the regiment were killed in action during the First World War. =Between the world wars= After the First World War the War Office decided that Ulster should be represented on the Army List as Connaught, Leinster and Munster already had their own regiments and so, in 1920, a new name was proposed for the Royal Irish Rifles. From 1 January 1921 the regiment became the Royal Ulster Rifles. The regiment moved to St Patrick's Barracks in 1937. In 1937 the already close relationship with the London Irish Rifles was formally recognised when they were incorporated into the Corps while still retaining their regimental identity as a territorial battalion. Two years later the London Irish formed a second battalion. =Second World War= Regular Army Riflemen of the Royal Ulster Rifles, 6 Airlanding Brigade, aboard a jeep and trailer, driving off Landing Zone N past a crashed Airspeed Horsa glider on the evening of 6 June 1944. When war was declared the 1st Battalion was serving in India, with the 31st Independent Brigade Group, which was trained in mountain warfare. When the brigade returned to the United Kingdom, it was decided that, with its light scale of equipment, the brigade could be converted into a glider-borne unit. 31st Infantry Brigade, which also included the 1st Border Regiment, 2nd South Staffs and 2nd Ox and Bucks, was renamed 1st Airlanding Brigade and trained as glider infantry.Ferguson, p. 6 They were assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, part of the British Army's airborne forces. The battalion, along with the 2nd Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, were later transferred to join the 12th Devonshire Regiment in the 6th Airlanding Brigade as part of the newly raised 6th Airborne Division which was actually only the second of two airborne divisions created by the British Army in World War II. Carried in Horsa gliders, the battalion took part in Operation Mallard, the British glider-borne landings in the later afternoon of 6 June 1944, otherwise known as D-Day. They served throughout the Battle of Normandy employed as normal infantry until August 1944 and the breakout from the Normandy beachhead where the entire 6th Airborne Division advanced 45 miles in 9 days. They returned to England in September 1944 for rest and retraining until December 1944 when the 6th Airborne was then recalled to Belgium after the surprise German offensive in the Ardennes which is now known as the Battle of the Bulge where the division played a comparatively small role in the mainly-American battle. They then took part in their final airborne mission of the war known as Operation Varsity, which was the airborne element of Operation Plunder, the crossing of the River Rhine by the 21st Army Group in March 1945. The 6th Airborne was joined by the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, and both divisions suffered heavy casualties. Sir Bernard Montgomery talking to Company Sergeant Major Kelly of Aldershot during a visit to 2nd Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles near Portsmouth in the run-up to D-Day. The battalion had previously served in his division earlier in the war. The 2nd Battalion was part of the 9th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division serving with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France from 1939-1940.Joslen, p. 247 The division was commanded by the then Major General Bernard Montgomery who would eventually lead the Anglo-Canadian forces as commander of the 21st Army Group in the North West Europe Campaign. The 3rd Infantry Division took part in the Battle of Dunkirk, where it gained a decent reputation and earned the nickname of \\"Monty's Ironsides\\", and had to be evacuated from Dunkirk with the rest of the BEF. The battalion returned to Europe for the D-Day landings in June 1944 and fought in the Battle of Normandy, specifically in Operation Charnwood where they were the first British troops to enter the city of Caen, which had previously seen bitter fighting in the British attempt to capture it.Williams, p. 24 Hostilities-only The 6th (Home Defence) Battalion was raised in 1939 from No. 200 Group National Defence Companies and consisting of older men with previous military experience who were unfit for active service. On 24 December 1940 the battalion was redesignated as the 30th Battalion, dropping the Home Defence from its title, and converted to a regular infantry battalion. It was disbanded in Northern Ireland in May 1943. The 7th (Home Defence) Battalion was raised on 29 June 1940, joining the 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The battalion served in Ulster until leaving for Great Britain in September 1942. On 24 December 1941, the battalion was redesignated the 31st Battalion and dropped the Home Defence title. The 8th Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles was also raised in 1940, and joined 203rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). In early 1942 the battalion was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 117th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The regiment served with Home Forces until November 1942 when it was sent overseas to North Africa to fight in the final stages of the North African Campaign as part of the British First Army. In September 1943 the regiment landed in Italy shortly after the initial invasion, now as part of the British Eighth Army, and served on the Italian Front until June 1944, when the regiment was broken up and the men were retrained as infantrymen, due to a severe shortage of infantrymen, particularly in Italy. Many of the men retrained were sent to the 2nd, 7th and 10th battalions of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), another rifle regiment, in 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade, part of 6th Armoured Division.Joslen, p. 297 The 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed on 12 September 1940 at Holywood from the younger soldiers of the 6th and 7th battalions and volunteers of the ages of 18 and 19 who were too young for conscription. The battalion spent most of its time guarding airfields and aerodromes before moving to Great Britain in October 1941. =Post-war= The Korean War memorial, at Belfast City Hall In 1947 the Royal Ulster Rifles were grouped with the other two remaining Irish regiments, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Royal Irish Fusiliers, into the North Irish Brigade.Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471 In 1948, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd and 86th), thus retaining the history of both of the previous regiments of foot. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles disembarked at Pusan in early November 1950 as part of the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group for service in the Korean War. They were transported forward to Uijeongbu, where under the direct command of the Eighth United States Army they were directed against guerrilla forces swept past by the rapid progress of the United Nations Army. By mid December 1950 a defensive line was being prepared on the south bank of the River Han on the border with North Korea protecting the approach to Seoul, the capital of South Korea. As the New Year started, the Fiftieth Chinese Communist Army engaged the United Nations troops focusing on 29 Brigade, who were dispersed over a very wide front (12 miles). The Royal Ulster Rifles fighting with 1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers were able to hold their position in their first major action at the Battle of Chaegunghyon and the Communist Army's progress was halted, at least temporarily. The Battle of the Imjin River began on 22 April 1951 with the goal of taking Seoul. By 25 April 1951, the Brigade was ordered to withdraw as the Communist forces were threatening to encircle it. With virtually no cover and seriously outnumbered, the Royal Ulster Rifles came under heavy fire as they withdrew to a blocking position. The Brigade was able to hold its position, despite fierce fighting, and neutralized the effectiveness of the Sixty-fourth Chinese Communist Army. Although the enemy's offensive had come within 5 miles of Seoul, the capital had been saved. At the time, the Times reported the Battle of Imjin River concluding with: The fighting 5th wearing St George and the Dragon and the Irish Giants with the Harp and Crown have histories that they would exchange with no one. As pride, sobered by mourning for fallen observes how well these young men have acquitted themselves in remotest Asia. The parts taken by the regiments may be seen as a whole. The motto of the Royal Ulster Rifles may have the last word Quis Separabit (who shall separate us). As a result of this action, members of the Royal Ulster Rifles were awarded two Distinguished Service Orders, two Military Crosses, two Military Medals, and three men were Mentioned in Despatches. When the area was recaptured, a memorial was erected to the 208 men killed or missing after the battle. It stood over-looking the battlefield until 1962 when Seoul's growth threatened to consume it, and it was carried by HMS Belfast back to Ireland where it was the focus of St Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena. When the barracks closed in 2008, the Imjin River Memorial was again moved, this time to the grounds of the Belfast City Hall. The Regiment continued to accept recruits from the rest of Ireland; for example, almost 50% of personnel in the 1st Battalion who arrived in Korea in 1950 were Irish nationals. In July 1968 the Royal Ulster Rifles amalgamated with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Royal Irish Fusiliers to form the Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd and 87th).

It is a categorical analogue of a collection of open subsets of a fixed open set in topology. In a Grothendieck topology, certain sieves become categorical analogues of open covers in topology. Sieves were introduced by in order to reformulate the notion of a Grothendieck topology. Definition Let C be a category, and let c be an object of C. A sieve S\\\\colon C^{\\\\rm op} \\\\to {\\\\rm Set} on c is a subfunctor of Hom(‚àí, c), i.e., for all objects c‚Ä≤ of C, S(c‚Ä≤) ‚äÜ Hom(c‚Ä≤, c), and for all arrows f:c‚Ä≥‚Üíc‚Ä≤, S(f) is the restriction of Hom(f, c), the pullback by f (in the sense of precomposition, not of fiber products), to S(c‚Ä≤); see the next section, below. Put another way, a sieve is a collection S of arrows with a common codomain that satisfies the condition, \\"If g:c‚Ä≤->c is an arrow in S, and if f:c‚Ä≥->c‚Ä≤ is any other arrow in C, then gf is in S.\\" Consequently, sieves are similar to right ideals in ring theory or filters in order theory. Pullback of sieves The most common operation on a sieve is pullback. Pulling back a sieve S on c by an arrow f:c‚Ä≤‚Üíc gives a new sieve f*S on c‚Ä≤. This new sieve consists of all the arrows in S that factor through c‚Ä≤. There are several equivalent ways of defining f*S. The simplest is: :For any object d of C, f*S(d) = { g:d->c‚Ä≤  fg ‚àà S(d)} A more abstract formulation is: :f*S is the image of the fibered product S√óHom(‚àí, c)Hom(‚àí, c‚Ä≤) under the natural projection S√óHom(‚àí, c)Hom(‚àí, c‚Ä≤)->Hom(‚àí, c‚Ä≤). Here the map Hom(‚àí, c‚Ä≤)‚ÜíHom(‚àí, c) is Hom(f, c‚Ä≤), the pullback by f. The latter formulation suggests that we can also take the image of S√óHom(‚àí, c)Hom(‚àí, c‚Ä≤) under the natural map to Hom(‚àí, c). This will be the image of f*S under composition with f. For each object d of C, this sieve will consist of all arrows fg, where g:d‚Üíc‚Ä≤ is an arrow of f*S(d). In other words, it consists of all arrows in S that can be factored through f. If we denote by ‚àÖc the empty sieve on c, that is, the sieve for which ‚àÖ(d) is always the empty set, then for any f:c‚Ä≤‚Üíc, f*‚àÖc is ‚àÖc‚Ä≤. Furthermore, f*Hom(‚àí, c) = Hom(‚àí, c‚Ä≤). Properties of sieves Let S and S‚Ä≤ be two sieves on c. We say that S ‚äÜ S‚Ä≤ if for all objects c‚Ä≤ of C, S(c‚Ä≤) ‚äÜ S‚Ä≤(c‚Ä≤). For all objects d of C, we define (S ‚à™ S‚Ä≤)(d) to be S(d) ‚à™ S‚Ä≤(d) and (S ‚à© S‚Ä≤)(d) to be S(d) ‚à© S‚Ä≤(d). We can clearly extend this definition to infinite unions and intersections as well. If we define SieveC(c) (or Sieve(c) for short) to be the set of all sieves on c, then Sieve(c) becomes partially ordered under ‚äÜ. It is easy to see from the definition that the union or intersection of any family of sieves on c is a sieve on c, so Sieve(c) is a complete lattice. A Grothendieck topology is a collection of sieves subject to certain properties. These sieves are called covering sieves. The set of all covering sieves on an object c is a subset J(c) of Sieve(c). J(c) satisfies several properties in addition to those required by the definition: *If S and S‚Ä≤ are sieves on c, S ‚äÜ S‚Ä≤, and S ‚àà J(c), then S‚Ä≤ ‚àà J(c). *Finite intersections of elements of J(c) are in J(c). Consequently, J(c) is also a distributive lattice, and it is cofinal in Sieve(c).

To be considered atomic, upon reading back a just written-to portion of the disk, the storage subsystem must return either the write data or the data that was on that portion of the disk before the write operations. Most computer disk drives are not considered stable storage because they do not guarantee atomic write; an error could be returned upon subsequent read of the disk where it was just written to in lieu of either the new or prior data.  Implementation  Multiple techniques have been developed to achieve the atomic property from weakly atomic devices such as disks. Writing data to a disk in two places in a specific way is one technique and can be done by application software. Most often though, stable storage functionality is achieved by mirroring data on separate disks via RAID technology (level 1 or greater). The RAID controller implements the disk writing algorithms that enable separate disks to act as stable storage. The RAID technique is robust against some single disk failure in an array of disks whereas the software technique of writing to separate areas of the same disk only protects against some kinds of internal disk media failures such as bad sectors in single disk arrangements.

It is named after Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier (1832-1913), a French army officer, and Yom Tov Lipman Lipkin (1846-1876), a Lithuanian Jew and son of the famed Rabbi Israel Salanter. Until this invention, no planar method existed of converting exact straight-line motion to circular motion, without reference guideways. In 1864, all power came from steam engines, which had a piston moving in a straight-line up and down a cylinder. This piston needed to keep a good seal with the cylinder in order to retain the driving medium, and not lose energy efficiency due to leaks. The piston does this by remaining perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, retaining its straight-line motion. Converting the straight-line motion of the piston into circular motion was of critical importance. Most, if not all, applications of these steam engines, were rotary. The mathematics of the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage is directly related to the inversion of a circle. Earlier Sarrus linkage There is an earlier straight-line mechanism, whose history is not well known, called the Sarrus linkage. This linkage predates the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage by 11 years and consists of a series of hinged rectangular plates, two of which remain parallel but can be moved normally to each other. Sarrus' linkage is of a three-dimensional class sometimes known as a space crank, unlike the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage which is a planar mechanism. Geometry Geometric diagram of a Peaucellier linkage In the geometric diagram of the apparatus, six bars of fixed length can be seen: OA, OC, AB, BC, CD, DA. The length of OA is equal to the length of OC, and the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal forming a rhombus. Also, point O is fixed. Then, if point B is constrained to move along a circle (for example, by attaching it to a bar with a length half way between O and B; path shown in red) which passes through O, then point D will necessarily have to move along a straight line (shown in blue). On the other hand, if point B were constrained to move along a line (not passing through O), then point D would necessarily have to move along a circle (passing through O). Mathematical proof of concept =Collinearity= First, it must be proven that points O, B, D are collinear. This may be easily seen by observing that the linkage is mirror-symmetric about line OD, so point B must fall on that line. More formally, triangles BAD and BCD are congruent because side BD is congruent to itself, side BA is congruent to side BC, and side AD is congruent to side CD. Therefore, angles ABD and CBD are equal. Next, triangles OBA and OBC are congruent, since sides OA and OC are congruent, side OB is congruent to itself, and sides BA and BC are congruent. Therefore, angles OBA and OBC are equal. Finally, because they form a complete circle, we have :‚à†OBA + ‚à†ABD + ‚à†DBC + ‚à†CBO = 360¬∞ but, due to the congruences, angle OBA = angle OBC and angle DBA = angle DBC, thus :2 √ó ‚à†OBA + 2 √ó ‚à†DBA = 360¬∞ :‚à†OBA + ‚à†DBA = 180¬∞ therefore points O, B, and D are collinear. =Inverse points= Let point P be the intersection of lines AC and BD. Then, since ABCD is a rhombus, P is the midpoint of both line segments BD and AC. Therefore, length BP = length PD. Triangle BPA is congruent to triangle DPA, because side BP is congruent to side DP, side AP is congruent to itself, and side AB is congruent to side AD. Therefore, angle BPA = angle DPA. But since angle BPA + angle DPA = 180¬∞, then 2 √ó angle BPA = 180¬∞, angle BPA = 90¬∞, and angle DPA = 90¬∞. Let: : x = \\\\ell_{BP} = \\\\ell_{PD} : y = \\\\ell_{OB} : h = \\\\ell_{AP} Then: :\\\\ell_{OB}\\\\cdot \\\\ell_{OD}=y(y+2x)=y^2+2xy :{\\\\ell_{OA}}^2 = (y + x)^2 + h^2 (due to the Pythagorean theorem) :{\\\\ell_{OA}}^2 = y^2 + 2xy + x^2 + h^2(same expression expanded) :{\\\\ell_{AD}}^2 = x^2 + h^2 (Pythagorean theorem) :{\\\\ell_{OA}}^2 - {\\\\ell_{AD}}^2 = y^2 + 2xy = \\\\ell_{OB} \\\\cdot \\\\ell_{OD} Since OA and AD are both fixed lengths, then the product of OB and OD is a constant: :\\\\ell_{OB}\\\\cdot \\\\ell_{OD} = k^2 and since points O, B, D are collinear, then D is the inverse of B with respect to the circle (O,k) with center O and radius k. =Inversive geometry= Thus, by the properties of inversive geometry, since the figure traced by point D is the inverse of the figure traced by point B, if B traces a circle passing through the center of inversion O, then D is constrained to trace a straight line. But if B traces a straight line not passing through O, then D must trace an arc of a circle passing through O. Q.E.D. =A typical driver= Slider-rocker four-bar acts as the driver of the Peaucellier‚ÄìLipkin linkage Peaucellier‚ÄìLipkin linkages (PLLs) may have several inversions. A typical example is shown in the opposite figure, in which a rocker-slider four-bar serves as the input driver. To be precise, the slider acts as the input, which in turn drives the right grounded link of the PLL, thus driving the entire PLL. =Historical notes= Sylvester (Collected Works, Vol. 3, Paper 2) writes that when he showed a model to Kelvin, he ‚Äúnursed it as if it had been his own child, and when a motion was made to relieve him of it, replied ‚ÄòNo! I have not had nearly enough of it‚Äîit is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.‚Äô‚Äù Cultural references A monumental-scale sculpture implementing the linkage in illuminated struts is on permanent exhibition in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

It is situated in the Laurentian Highlands north of the Saint Lawrence River, into which it drains via the Saguenay River through the Chicoutimi and Aux-Sables Rivers. The lake is fed by dozens of small rivers coming from the Laurentian Highlands. The three principal being the Pikauba, Cyriac and Aux-Ecorces Rivers. The towns on its shores include Lac-K√©nogami, and H√©bertville station. The area around the lake is served on the east side by route 175 (boulevard Talbot); on the north side by the K√©nogami road, the Route des B√¢tisseurs and the Saint-Dominique street in Jonqui√®re.

Sequence from. thumb300pxThree dimensional structure of almost the same pseudoknot from telomerase RNA. (A) sticks (B) backbone. The pdb-file is based on . Colors: A U C G __NOTOC__ A pseudoknot is a nucleic acid secondary structure containing at least two stem-loop structures in which half of one stem is intercalated between the two halves of another stem. The pseudoknot was first recognized in the turnip yellow mosaic virus in 1982. Pseudoknots fold into knot-shaped three-dimensional conformations but are not true topological knots. Prediction and identification The structural configuration of pseudoknots does not lend itself well to bio-computational detection due to its context-sensitivity or ‚Äúoverlapping‚Äù nature. The base pairing in pseudoknots is not well nested; that is, base pairs occur that \\"overlap\\" one another in sequence position. This makes the presence of pseudoknots in RNA sequences more difficult to predict by the standard method of dynamic programming, which use a recursive scoring system to identify paired stems and consequently, most cannot detect non-nested base pairs. The newer method of stochastic context-free grammars suffers from the same problem. Thus, popular secondary structure prediction methods like Mfold and Pfold will not predict pseudoknot structures present in a query sequence; they will only identify the more stable of the two pseudoknot stems. It is possible to identify a limited class of pseudoknots using dynamic programming, but these methods are not exhaustive and scale worse as a function of sequence length than non-pseudoknotted algorithms.Rivas E, Eddy S.

Paper presented at the ICALP. Biological significance Several important biological processes rely on RNA molecules that form pseudoknots, which are often RNAs with extensive tertiary structure. For example, the pseudoknot region of RNase P is one of the most conserved elements in all of evolution. The telomerase RNA component contains a pseudoknot that is critical for activity, and several viruses use a pseudoknot structure to form a tRNA-like motif to infiltrate the host cell.  Representing pseudoknots  Many types of pseudoknots exist, differing by how they cross and how many times they cross. To reflect this difference, pseudoknots are classed into H-, K-, L-, M-types, with each successive type adding a layer of step intercalation. The simple telomerase P2b-P3 example in the article, for example, is an H-type pseudoknot. RNA secondary structure is usually represented by the dot-bracket notation, with pairing round brackets \`()\` indicating basepairs in a stem and dots representing loops. The interrupted stems of pseudoknots mean that such notation must be extended with extra brackets, or even letters, so that different sets of stems can be represented. One such extension uses, in nesting order, \`([{<ABCDE\` for opening and \`edcba>}])\` for closing.

It is considered to be the birthplace of the Southern English goth subculture as it had already been established in Northern England, in particular Leeds and Manchester, and in Belfast, though when the culture was being developed in the North it was commonly known as \\"alternative\\" before being given the goth moniker. As one of the most famous meeting points for early goths, it lent its name to the term Batcaver, used to describe fans of the original gothic rock music, who would adorn themselves in Batwing coffin necklaces to distinguish themselves from other less prolific goth clubs. The Batcave opened every Wednesday at the Gargoyle Club in Soho from 21 July 1982. Originally specialising in new wave and glam rock, it later focused on gothic rock. Olli Wisdom,Lowey, Nick. In The Batcave With Mr & Mrs Fiend: Alien Sex Fiend On Goth & Marriage TheQuietus.com. 8 September 2010 the lead singer in the house band Specimen, ran the night with Specimen's guitarist Jon Klein as art director, and initially with the assistance of production manager Hugh Jones. Famous regulars at the Batcave who came for meeting friends and having a drink, included musicians and singers such as Nick Cave, Robert Smith of the Cure, Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin, the members of Bauhaus, Marc Almond and the members of Foetus. An array of bands would play live, alongside 4-hour sets from their resident DJ Hamish MacDonald, with a guest DJ upstairs when the club-night transferred to the Subway club in Leicester Square in February 1983, with a US Army jeep parked by the bar. (The Batcave later decamped to Fooberts in Soho). The bands involved included electronic leading act Alien Sex Fiend, the host's band Specimen who took influence from 1970s glam rock, Hamish's band Sexbeat, and Sex Gang Children, who would go on to prove influential in the gothic rock, dark cabaret and deathrock movements. The club also showed 8mm films in the Gargoyle's old theatre and occasionally featured unusual cabaret such as Mr Swing the Fakir and mud-wrestling. Olli Wisdom told The Face: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt suck our cheeks, we have fun.‚Äù In an interview for Mick Mercer's Gothic Rock, Jonny (Slut) Melton said of the Batcave: > \\"It was a light bulb for all the freaks and people like myself who were from > the sticks and wanted a bit more from life. Freaks, weirdos, sexual deviants > ... There's people around who'll always be attracted by something shiny, > glittering, exciting.

It was more Gotham City than Aleister Crowley.\\" As the terms \\"new punks\\" and \\"goth\\" became interchangeable, much of the image and fashion adopted by the subculture can be traced back to the bands that played at the Batcave. In 1983, a vinyl record entitled The Batcave: Young Limbs And Numb Hymns was released on the London Records label.

Its two rules: 'No Funk, No Disco' set it apart from the norm of club music in the early-80s. It was the first club specifically geared to provide a dance floor for punk, rock, rockabilly, glam, reggae, garage, and psychedelia. Within months, the DJ setlist was being quoted in The Face and Sounds, and the club began setting a soundtrack for the mid-1980s. In 2008, Specimen played live at a 25th Anniversary Batcave party hosted by Club Antichrist in London. The show was recorded as a live album, Specimen Alive at the Batcave and released on Eyeswideshut/Metropolis Records. In 2009, Specimen's Jonny Slut and Jon Klein appeared at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology following the exhibition 'Gothic Dark Glamour', which featured Jon Klein's 1983 'Pigeon Shit' DIY stage outfit alongside high fashion designers such as Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen. The Fashion Symposium acknowledged the Batcave as a major influence on prevailing high fashion.

He was founder and president of the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), a think tank on European and international issues. He was president of the Ireland China Institute, an independent think tank based in Dublin, Ireland, which was officially launched in October 2019. His career spanned Irish public sector bodies and work in the private sector. At various times he was General Secretary of the Labour Party, a Teachta D√°la (TD), a Senator, and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Early life and education Halligan was born in Dublin in 1936. He grew up in Rialto and was educated at St James's Christian Brothers School, Dublin. He studied in Dublin Institute of Technology and became a chemical analyst in the CI√â depot in Inchicore. He and three friends decided to go to university and formed a co- operative and worked at various jobs in London to fund their studies. In 1959, he began a economics and law degree at University College Dublin. There he was influenced by lecturers including George O‚ÄôBrien, Patrick Lynch and Garrett FitzGerald. He received a master‚Äôs degree in economics from UCD in 1964. Career Following an early career as an economist, working with the Irish Sugar Company until 1967, he became involved in politics. In that year, he became General Secretary of the Labour Party. The party leader, Brendan Corish, relied on Halligan's intellectual and political skills in his new role. Under Halligan, the party underwent an energetic reorganisation. New structures and policies were put in place, coinciding with the party's leftward policy shift and an acute anti-coalition stance. He strongly supported both approaches, but was instrumental in securing the party's eventual, somewhat unwilling, reversal of its anti-coalition stance after its disappointing result in the 1969 general election. The 1973 general election resulted in a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government coming to power. Halligan was appointed to Seanad √âireann in 1973; three years later, he won a by-election in Dublin South-West, and thus became a TD. After boundary changes, he stood in the new Dublin Finglas at the 1977 general election, but was not elected. Halligan stood again in the revived Dublin North-West constituency at the 1981 and November 1982 general elections, but again was not elected. He continued to serve as General Secretary of the party until 1980, and was appointed a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1983 until 1984, replacing Frank Cluskey, where he specialised in economic affairs and energy policy. In 1980, Halligan set up CIPA, his own public affairs consultancy based in Dublin, and became a lecturer in Economics at the University of Limerick. He was also chairman of European Movement Ireland during the late 1980s. In 1985, he was appointed as Chairman of B√≥rd na M√≥na, the Irish Peat Development Authority, a position he held for ten years. In 1989 he founded the Institute of European Affairs (IEA), which later became the IIEA. He was Director of CIPA until 2014. Resulting from his keen interest and experience in energy policy and renewable energy, Halligan served as Chair of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland from 2007 until 2014. He was President of the IIEA, and he was also a Board Member of Mainstream Renewable Energy. In later years he also worked on the foundation and development of the Ireland China Institute, which, with its maxim bridging the gap between knowledge and understanding, seeks to strengthen Irish-Chinese diplomatic relations, developing cultural links and fostering a deeper understanding of the respective cultural norms and values between the two nations. He was also President of ICI. Death Halligan died on 9 August 2020 after a long illness. Upon his death, Taoiseach M√≠che√°l Martin described him as ‚Äúa man who gave his life to politics and the public service with a deep commitment to the institutions of the state‚Äù. European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan stated that ‚ÄúBrendan was a committed European to his fingertips.

They fought south west of the Gulf of C√°diz on 18 August and to the east of the small Portuguese port of Lagos, after which the battle is named, on 19 August. La Clue was attempting to evade Boscawen and bring the French Mediterranean Fleet into the Atlantic, avoiding battle if possible; he was then under orders to sail for the West Indies. Boscawen was under orders to prevent a French breakout into the Atlantic, and to pursue and fight the French if they did. During the evening of 17 August the French fleet successfully passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, but was sighted by a British ship shortly after it entered the Atlantic. The British fleet was in nearby Gibraltar, undergoing a major refit. It left port amidst great confusion, most ships not having their refurbishments completed, with many delayed and sailing in a second squadron. Aware that he was pursued, La Clue altered his plan and changed course; half his ships failed to follow him in the dark, but the British did. The British caught up with the French on the 18th and fierce fighting ensued, during which several ships were badly damaged and one French ship was captured. The British, who greatly outnumbered the remaining six French ships, pursued them through the moonlit night of 18‚Äì19 August, during which a further two French ships made their escape. On the 19th the remnants of the French fleet attempted to shelter in neutral Portuguese waters near Lagos, but Boscawen violated that neutrality, capturing a further two French ships and destroying the other two. Background The endemic ill feeling between France and Great Britain during the 18th century turned into open warfare in 1754 and 1755. In 1756 what become known as the Seven Years' War broke out across Europe, pitting France, Austria and Russia against Britain and Prussia. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against Prussia, and launched what it saw as its main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive against Britain. By the beginning of 1759 neither alliance had the advantage, in either the land or sea campaigns, and both were having serious problems financing the war. In 1759 more than 60 per cent of French revenue went to service its debt, causing numerous shortages. The French Navy in particular was overstretched and suffered from the lack of a coherent doctrine, exacerbated by the inexperience verging on incompetence of the secretary of state for the navy, Nicolas Ren√© Berryer, a former chief of police. Meanwhile, Britain's war effort up to early 1757 had been a failure, with setbacks in Europe, North America, India and at sea. From June it came under the control of the assertive new secretary of state for the southern department (foreign minister), William Pitt, who imposed a coordinated strategy. By early 1759 this was beginning to bear fruit. In response to the British successes, the ministers of the French king, Louis XV, planned a direct invasion of Britain, which, if successful, would have decided the war in their favour. An army of 17,000 was collected at Vannes, in the south east of Brittany, and nearly 100 transports were assembled near Quiberon Bay. In its final form the French plan required these transports to be escorted by the French navy. However, at the best of times the French struggled to crew their full fleet with experienced mariners; landsmen could be used, but even a small deficiency in ship handling translated into a marked handicap in combat. Three years into the war, thousands of French seamen were held as prisoners by the British; many more were engaged in speculative, and occasionally lucrative, privateering careers; and the unhealthy conditions, onerous onboard discipline and poor wages, paid late, were a strong disincentive to service. The transports also required at least a cadre of skilled men. The French possessed 73 ships of the line, the largest warships of the time: 30 serving abroad and 43 in home waters. The latter were split between the Atlantic port of Brest (22 ships) and the Mediterranean port of Toulon, with a small number at two ports on the Bay of Biscay: Lorient and Rochefort. In total these ships required an aggregate complement of about 25,000 men; they were more than 9,000 short of this. The British had 40 ships of the line in home waters, and a further 15 in their Mediterranean Fleet, which was based in Gibraltar. =Prelude= alt=An oil painting of a man in 18th-century attire against a background of the sea In May 1759 Edward Boscawen took command of the British fleet in the Mediterranean. As well as 15 ships of the line he also had 12 frigatessmaller and faster than ships of the line and primarily intended for raiding, reconnaissance and messaging. He was tasked with harassing the French, protecting British merchant shipping, and ensuring the safety of the British outpost and naval base at Gibraltar. By late July the ships of the British fleet were low on supplies and in urgent need of maintenance after their prolonged period at sea, during which some ships had been damaged by enemy action. The fleet retired to Gibraltar, arriving on 4August. There they began the difficult process of scraping the bottoms of the ships free of barnacles and seaweed, repairing and replacing their rigging and replacing spars. While this refurbishment was under way, fresh orders arrived, alerting Boscawen to the likelihood that the French Mediterranean Fleet would attempt to join up with their Atlantic Fleet, probably at Brest, and instructing him to prevent it. He ordered the first two of his frigates to be ready for sea to patrol to the east, where the Mediterranean narrowed to the bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar, to give warning if the French were to attempt to break out. Earlier in the year, an aspect of the British strategy had played out in the West Indies. In February, 4,000 British soldiers landed on the French West Indian possession of Guadeloupe. This island's immense sugar production was supposed to exceed that of all the British Leeward Islands combined. After great difficulties in preparing them for sea, nine French ships of the line, under Maximin de Bompart, were despatched to relieve the island. They arrived the day after the French governor surrendered to the British on 1May. News of this disaster was passed back to Paris, where after deliberation it was decided to reinforce Bompart's force with the Mediterranean Fleet. Orders to sail reached its commander, Admiral Jean-Fran√ßois de La Clue-Sabran, at the end of July, and it left Toulon on 5August. It consisted of twelve ships of the line and three frigates. La Clue intended to pass the Strait of Gibraltar by night, in order to keep the British in ignorance of his absence from the Mediterranean. He anticipated this might scatter his fleet, and he had ordered his ships to rendezvous off the Spanish port of Cadiz. During the late evening of 17 August the French passed through the strait, but were observed shortly afterwards by the British frigate HMS Gibraltar. The French were aware they had been spotted, and realising by now that the British fleet was in Gibraltar, anticipated a prompt pursuit. alt=A map showing the locations of the main named locations near where the battle took place The approach of the Gibraltar, firing her guns to indicate that the enemy had been sighted, took the British by surprise. There was a scramble to get under way. Most captains and many crew were ashore; some, including Boscawen, were dining several miles away. Most ships sailed without their captains, some under the command of junior officers. Their seniors followed on as best they couldthe flagship, HMS Namur, sailed with three captains and the admiral on boardand sorted themselves out as circumstances allowed. Many officers and men were left ashore. Several ships were barely seaworthy. The process of fitting, or \\"bending\\", sails to the masts of the large warships of the time was a complicated one, and most British ships were forced to do this as they got under way, in the dark, undermanned and with few officers. Some were also fitting spars or even stepping in their topmasts. Ships were cluttered with material for their refits and with unstowed stores. HMS Prince had so many casks on one of her gun decks as to be unable to operate that deck's guns; the crew of HMS America threw large amounts of loose material overboard. Despite these difficulties, by 11:00 pm, within three hours of Gibraltar appearing, eight British ships of the line had warped out of the harbour and were heading for the Atlantic. Several ships were left behind, under Vice-Admiral Thomas Brodrick, with orders to sail as soon as they could be made fit for sea. Ships sailing at night usually displayed lanterns from their sterns and masts, so as to avoid collisions and to allow groups of ships to maintain contact. Wishing to be as inconspicuous as possible, the French ships probably did not follow this practice. The French ships had all been issued with sealed orders, which they were to open on passing the Strait of Gibraltar; these instructed them that the fleet was to rendezvous at C√°diz. Knowing they had been observed by the British, La Clue changed his plan. Instead of heading for C√°diz, where he feared he could be easily blockaded by the British, he decided to sail more westerly, to clear Cape St. Vincent and head into the North Atlantic. However, the French navy did not have an effective system of night signalling. So at about midnight La Clue had his flagship, Oc√©an, light her stern lantern, turn to port (left, or westward) and reduce her speed. Normally, such actions would be accompanied by firing a cannon to draw attention. The naval historian Sam Willis suggests it is possible that La Cluewho had been ordered to avoid battle at all costsknowing the entire fleet was relatively close and not wishing to advertise his manoeuvre to the British, omitted to do this. Battle =At sea= alt=an oil painting showing several 18th-century warships fighting Eight of the fifteen ships in the French fleet continued on to C√°diz. It is not clear if this was because they did not observe the flagship's change of course, because they did not understand its implications, or because they felt their freshly opened orders took precedence. At dawn on 18 August La Clue could see only six other ships. He ordered them to rally on the flagship and heave to and await the anticipated appearance of the rest of the fleet. At about 6:00 am a group of large ships came into view and La Clue remained stationary, believing them to be the missing component of his fleet. It was only when the topsails of the nine ships of the second British squadron, the stragglers under Brodrick, were sighted farther back that it was realised all these ships were British. The seven French ships sailed at the speed of their slowest member, the Souverain. Boscawen ordered his ships to maintain formation, to avoid his fastest ships reaching and engaging the French squadron individually and being defeated in detail. The British ships proved to be faster, and were slightly favoured by variable winds, allowing them to gradually overhaul the French by the afternoon of 18 August. Boscawen repeatedly signalled to his ships to \\"Make more speed\\". Several of the British ships were hampered by their newly warped sails splitting, or their newly fitted spars breaking loose, as they were overstrained by crews eager to catch the French. At 1:00 pm the French ships hoisted their battle ensigns and opened fire at long range. Ships of the line had most of their guns mounted in their sides, to allow them to fire broadsides, but had a small number of lighter guns mounted in their sterns, able to fire to their rears. It was not possible to effectively fire ahead of such ships. The French were thus able to fire at the British as they grew closer, while the British were unable to offer much reply. The French attempted to disable the British ships' sails and rigging, but with little effect. alt=An oil painting of a large 18th-century warship At 2:30 pm the British Culloden engaged the rearmost French ship, the Centaure; they were evenly matched, each being equipped with 74 heavy guns, 37 on each side. By this time the French had formed a line ahead formation, with their flagship in the centre. Boscawen claimed he wished his leading, and therefore his fastest, ships to engage the first French ships they encountered; then, as the next British ship arrived, bypass this fight to attack the next French ship in line. Any bypassed French ships could, he believed, be safely left to Brodrick's squadron. However, only his own flagship adopted this approach, and only four of the seven French ships were engaged. Centaure was attacked by five British ships, fighting on for five hours and seriously delaying the British pursuit before surrendering after being battered into a wreck and having more than a third of her crew killed or wounded. Meanwhile, Boscawen had pressed on in his 90-gun flagship, determined to engage the largest ship in the French fleet, La Clue's flagship, the 80-gun Oc√©an. Namur passed three French ships, receiving a broadside from each; Boscawen ordered that there be no return fire, instead having his crew lie down, to minimise casualties. By 4:00 pm Namur was close enough to Oc√©an to open fire and a short, sharp fight developed. Oc√©an had nearly 200 men killed or wounded, with La Clue among the latter; while Namur had one of her three masts shot away, together with the topsail yards of both remaining masts. With Namur unable to manoeuvre, Oc√©an, also badly damaged, fled. Boscawen transferred his flag to . As the sun set, the six surviving French ships continued to flee to the north west, with those British ships not slowed by battle damage close behind them. There was sufficient moonlight to allow the British ships to keep in touch, although the two fastest French ships, Souverain and Guerrier, slipped away into the Atlantic during the night. The naval historian Nicholas Tracey suggests La Clue sailed an incorrect course, failed to weather Cape St. Vincent, and became trapped against a lee shore. The badly wounded La Clue now had command only over his flagship and three other ships of the line, Redoutable, T√©m√©raire and Modeste, none of which had yet been engaged. Despairing of escape, he led the remnants of his fleet to a small river west of Lagos in Portugal. Portugal was neutral and it would be illegal for Boscawen to attack him there. There was also a small Portuguese fort overlooking the anchorage and La Clue may have hoped this would be some deterrent. =Off Lagos= upright=0.8 As Boscawen approached in Newark, the Portuguese opened fire and he hove to outside of cannon range and selected several ships to attack the French \\"without any regard to the laws of neutrality.\\" The British America attacked Oc√©an, firing a broadside from short range and demanding her surrender. The French, who had been in the process of abandoning ship, struck their colours. The British were unable to tow Oc√©an off as she had been run ashore with some force in order to prevent this. So they evacuated those left of the crew and set fire to her; several hours later, around midnight, the fire reached her magazine and she exploded. Three ships from Brodrick's rear squadron were sent in after the Redoutable. HMS Prince fired repeatedly into her and then boarded her. She was also firmly beached and so, like Oc√©an, she was torched, and also exploded several hours later. Having observed Oc√©an and Redoutable set alight and seeing HMS Jersey sailing towards them the crew of Modeste fled or surrendered and she was towed out, little damaged, to the British fleet; Jersey was fired on by the Portuguese forts during this operation. The last French ship, T√©m√©raire, was attacked by Warspite at 2:45 pm, but her crew refused to surrender. Warspite manoeuvred so as to be able to fire into T√©m√©raires stern, where the French could do little to fire back, and after an hour T√©m√©raire also struck her colours and was towed out. Aftermath The French had 500 men killed, wounded or captured; against 56 British fatalities and 196 wounded. La Clue, seriously wounded, was carried ashore before the British arrived and survived; five years later he was promoted to lieutenant-general. The battle had no effect on the French plans to invade Britain. The two French ships which escaped from the battle eventually reached Rochefort. The five French ships in Cadiz were blockaded by Boscawen's second-in-command, Admiral Brodrick. They were instructed to head for French Atlantic ports if they were able to break this blockade, with a view to reinforcing the fleet in Brest. But by the time they evaded Brodrick during a winter storm in January 1760, the French Atlantic Fleet had been destroyed at the Battle of Quiberon Bay, and they returned to Toulon instead. Hearing the news of the victory, the notoriously nervous British prime minister, the Duke of Newcastle, said \\"I was afraid of invasion till now.\\" Boscawen's violation of Portuguese neutrality was fully supported by his government, which placated the Portuguese by persuading them that it was an inadvertent result of Boscawen's general chase order. Three years later, the Spanish and French governments used this breach of neutrality as one of their pretexts for declaring war on and invading Portugal. Boscawen, his captains and their crews were f√™ted in Britain. After completing their interrupted refits, several of Boscawen's victorious ships were transferred to Admiral Edward Hawke's fleet off Brest, and five were with Hawke when he destroyed the Brest fleet in Quiberon Bay in November. The historian Sarah Kinkel describes the Battle of Lagos as a \\"definitive\\" victory. The historian Geoffrey Blainey describes Boscawen as perhaps the most successful naval commander of the 18th century, \\"when inconclusive battles at sea were normal.\\" The battle was one of a series of British victories in 1759 which caused the year to be known as an annus mirabilis (Latin for \\"year of wonders\\"). The three captured French ships went on to serve in the British navy as HMS Centaur, Modeste and Temeraire. Serving on board Oc√©an as a junior officer was Pierre Andr√© de Suffren, who was later to gain fame as an admiral leading a French fleet in the Indian Ocean. A young slave named Olaudah Equiano, who would later become a prominent abolitionist in England, participated in the engagement on the British side. He included an account of the battle in his autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.

It is located in Bagerhat District in the southwestern part of the country; and lies north of the Bay of Bengal coastline. Mongla is one of the major ports of the Bengal delta. Mongla is located from the city of Khulna, which is a regional industrial center. Due to increasing congestion in Bangladesh's largest port in Chittagong, many international shipping companies have turned to Mongla as an alternative. Mongla is a gateway for tourist ships traveling to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the region, including the Sundarbans and the Mosque City of Bagerhat. The port also hosts the Mongla Export Processing Zone (Mongla EPZ). History Straddle carrier at work in Mongla The port was founded in 1950 to serve the southwestern region of East Bengal. It was originally known as Chalna Port. Geography It was formerly located at Chalna, about upstream on the Pasur River but it is now located 48 km south of Khulna city, as established on 11 December 1954. The Port is surrounded and protected by the Sundarban mangrove forest.Mongla Port Authority - Other Information The port is situated at the confluence of the Pasur River and the Mongla River. It lies about north of the Bay of Bengal. Port infrastructure The port has 11 jetties and 8 warehouses. It uses 12 swinging moorings in deeper sections in the river. The port is connected by the Bangladesh Railway to the Khulna Metropolitan Area. Ship services In 2015-16, 636 ships used Mongla port. Mongla is connected to most major ports in the world, particularly Asian ports. Hundreds of ships use the port each year, most of which come via Singapore, Hong Kong and Colombo. Mongla is also connected to most inland ports in Bangladesh, including the Port of Dhaka and the Port of Narayanganj. Following a coastal shipping agreement with India, Mongla has a direct shipping route with the Port of Kolkata in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal. A coastal shipping agreement has also been signed with Thailand. Trade Rupsha Bridge connects Khulna and Mongla The port is open for 24 hours and up to 225 metre long ships can enter into the port for discharging cargo. A constraint free large channel is available for anchorage and loading/unloading facilities on both sides for 33 ships at a time.

' and ', also known as the Enchin and Ennin factions, respectively, were rival branches of the Tendai sect of Buddhism created in the 9th century and based on Mount Hiei just outside Kyoto.Jimon's head temple was Mii-dera, at the foot of Mount Hiei, while the Sanmon sect was based at Enryaku-ji, at the summit of the mountain. The origins of the schism began with a rivalry between the lineages of two disciples of the founder of Tendai Buddhism, Saicho, named Ennin and Enchin, over who would be the of Enryaku-ji temple, rather than based on differing opinions on dogma or doctrine. Following the deaths of Enchin in 891, this rivalry only deepened, and by 923, the 18th abbot, Ry≈çgen, further enflamed this rivalry, as he sought to solidify the Ennin lineages hold not just on Enryaku-ji, but as the sole representatives of the Tendai sect at the Imperial court. For example, in the ≈åwa Debate of 963, the Tendai side of the debate included Ry≈çgen and his close associates in the same lineage, despite more qualified and eminent monks from the Tendai sect being available. Subsequent conflicts were often the result of a monk from one faction becoming appointed Abbot (zasu) of the other faction's temple, or of one faction not being invited to events, conferences, or festivals held by the other. For example, in 981, the Imperial court appointed one Yokei (Enchin lineage) as abbot of Hossh≈ç-ji temple, which led to a protest by the Ennin lineage. 160 monks of Ennin's lineage marched on the Chancellor's mansion threatening violence if the appointment was not rescinded. In 993 fighting broke out between the factions. Monks of the Enchin lineage were driven out of Enryaku- ji and moved down the mountain to Mii-dera forming the faction, while the monks of the Ennin lineage who remained at Enryaku-ji formed the faction. Along with other major temples in the capitol, both sects formed the first standing armies of warrior monks, called s≈çhei. When the Genpei War broke out in 1180, the warrior monks of the two sects found themselves on opposing sides, the Enryaku-ji Sanmon monks supporting the Taira clan while Mii-dera's Jimon monks supported the Minamoto clan. Only after the end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate did the conflicts between the two sects settle down. However, the division and disagreement lasted several centuries longer, until both temples were destroyed by the forces of Oda Nobunaga at the end of the 16th century. Though it is unclear when the names Jimon and Sanmon fell out of use, and when the two temples ceased fighting, the destruction of both temples by a greater, larger outside force brought a definite end to their quarrels.

Between 1936 and 1941, the subcommittee published exhaustive hearings and reports on the use of industrial espionage, private police agencies, strikebreaking services, munitions in industrial warfare, and employers' associations to break strikes and to disrupt legal union activities in other ways. Robert M. La Follette, Jr., a Republican and Progressive Party Senator from Wisconsin, chaired the committee. The Committee investigated the five largest detective agencies: the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, the National Corporation Service, the Railway Audit and Inspection Company, and the Corporations Auxiliary Company. Most of the agencies subpoenaed, including the Pinkerton Agency, attempted to destroy their records before receiving the subpoenas, but enough evidence remained to \\"piece together a picture of intrigue\\". It was revealed that Pinkerton had operatives \\"in practically every union in the country\\". Of 1,228 operatives, there were five in the United Mine Workers, nine in the United Rubber Workers, seventeen in the United Textile Workers, and fifty-five in the United Auto Workers that had organized General Motors.The Eye That Never Sleeps, A History of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, Frank Morn, 1982, pp. 186‚Äì187. The Committee reported that as late as 1937, its census of working labor spies from 1933 to 1937 totaled 3,871 for the period. Private security firms like the Pinkerton National Detective Agency and Burns were employed to infiltrate labor unions. The Committee concluded that espionage was \\"the most efficient method known to management to prevent unions from forming, to weaken them if they secure a foothold, and to wreck them when they try their strength.\\"From Blackjacks To Briefcases -- A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xvi. The committee also reported: > Such a spy system ... places the employer in the very heart of the union > council from the outset of any organizing effort. News of organizers coming > into a town, contacts the organizers make among his employees, the names of > employees who join the union, all organization plans, all activities of the > union‚Äîthese are as readily available to the employer as though he himself > were running the union. Although the inquiry by the Committee achieved minor legal resolutions, it failed to achieve any effective regulatory legislation that might have curtailed the worst practices of strike-breaking agencies. Despite this, the revelations enraged the public as it brought more attention to the grievances of laborers. History The La Follette Committee was created after the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. In an effort to employ the best suited labor management system between unions and employers, the National Labor Relations Act established the National Labor Relations Board. Heber Blankenhorn, of the NLRB, began the La Follette Committee and was its conspirator for four years.Gall, J.

Labeled \\"Son of the Wild Jackass,\\" and with a prominent politician as a brother, the reputation of La Follette Jr.'s family preceded him.Auerbach, Jerold S. \\"The La Follette Committee and the C.I.O.\\". Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 48, no. 1 (Autumn, 1964): 3-20. As the newly appointed chairman to the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, La Follette's committee consisted of pro-Republican staff members. La Follette's gifted team of researchers, investigators, attorneys, and writers arose as a prominent governmental team supporting mass labor during the New Deal administration. Initial grievances of the committee From 1936 to 1937, the La Follette Committee began its assessment of four prominent anti-union practices which suppressed the advancement of organized laborers. The committee's intentions lay in preserving the rights of the worker when denied by employers, and in 1937, found industrial espionage to be a common tool employed against unions. From \\"motion-picture producers to steel makers,\\" the enormous number of companies resorting to espionage, reported the La Follette Committee, prevented the practice of collective bargaining between companies and employees. Spies of corporations befriended victims into creating reports which they used to forewarn employers of potential strikes and assemblies. Spying, the La Follette Committee declared, weakens unions and \\"incites to violence, preaches strikes, inflames the hot-headed and leads the union to disaster\\". Detective agencies and those utilizing industrial espionage resorted to the protection against radicalism, exposure of theft, deterrence of sabotage, and improvement of labor-management relations as justification of their actions. The Federal Union of Automobile Workers, consisting of 26,000 members in the General Motors plant in 1934, was reported as having at least several spies in the union's executive board. Within two years, membership of the union dropped to merely 120. The Committee affirmed that through the employment of espionage, employees became subjugated to private corporations and were denied constitutional rights. The Committee revealed that when espionage failed to prevent unionism, employers also exploited workers through the use of munitions in anticipation of labor trouble. With the threat of communism sweeping the nation and employers utilizing it as a scapegoat to deter unionization, munitions companies distributed various forms of deterrence. Machine guns, tear gas bombs, and clubs were a few of the hindrances wielded to prevent and disperse union meetings. The Committee declared the use of these munitions as the demise of \\"labor relations,\\" based upon the companies' lack of acknowledgment toward unions and only in their best economic interests. By preventing workers from freely gathering in public spaces, employers who opposed them with the use of munitions and other forms of physical coercion denied them their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly. Strikebreakers were reported to be the third form of anti-union oppression utilized by employers. The Committee reported many being convicted criminals, and the animosity of the strikers held towards these men creates \\"violence and bloodshed.\\" The La Follette Committee confirmed the accounts of former strike breakers who described to them their role in promoting violence in an effort to display the wrongdoings of strikers. Private police agencies offered employers the last form of union oppression. This form of industrial coercion proved to be clear by constitutional protection as the men employed by the corporations were not held accountable to anyone but their employers. Witnesses in industrial communities revealed to the committee the abusive power of private police; their constant harassment and use of physical violence repressed the First Amendment rights of citizens. Like espionage, munitions utilization, and strikebreaking, private police agencies testified to the incompatibility of industrial tyranny over the liberties of industrial workers. La Follette Committee and California On behalf of the National Labor Relations Board, the committee made preliminary investigations in California in 1936 and 1938. Paul Taylor, one of the left- liberal staff members appointed by La Follette and his Marine Corps friend, urged him to investigate the West Coast; without the necessary funding though, the committee's chairman was doubtful. With a lack in financial stability, the committee's future seemed tentative; support from the La Follette's administration, left-sided Californians, and various worker based organizing groups, however, allowed for the committees continued existence. In 1939, with an allocation of $50,000 presented by a newly appointed California senator and with the books, The Grapes of Wrath and Factories in the Field, exposing California's working conditions to the country, the La Follette Committee was given further incentive to investigate the West Coast. The results were testimonies being held in newly opened offices in the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Despite La Follette urging his investigative team to search for infringements on constitutional rights of workers rather than the political affiliations of employers, his work became deemed as a backing to Communism and became resented by those harboring anti-union ideals. Aside from employers, local law enforcement agencies, and growers showing a lack in intimidation from the committee, Republican attorney general Earl Warren demonstrated strong opposition by supporting law enforcement in resisting subpoenas. Despite strong resentment to the committee's efforts, it succeeded in depicting the premise of the Violations: California laborers of the 1930s were being denied constitutional rights by employers and anti-union officials. The committee found the West Coast region under the control of a convoluted array of employer controlled associations. The premise of the committee's California study, \\"the existence of the National Labor Relations Act, the reaction of employee or employer organizations to its application, and their long struggle to realize or frustrate benefits which it promised,\\" proved as a significant aspect of the committee's investigation. With its findings from the West Coast investigation, the committee found the economic interests of the employers to be guiding their actions in denying constitutional rights to their employees. As a result, the Committee appealed to the government to intervene in the nation's economic existence in order to \\"preserve these [constitutional] rights and provide a foundation for their exercise,\\" and claimed, \\"that a person possess certain rights of free speech and assembly under the Constitution which must be observed, regardless of his political affiliations, no matter how strongly these political affiliations may be proved\\".Senate Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor, Hearings, Oppressive Labor Practices Act, Senate, 76 Cong., 8-10, 97-102 In an effort to utilize the federal government in defending civil liberties, La Follette introduced S.1970 inn an effort to remove the four oppressive labor practices noted during the investigation. The California investigations paved the way for the La Follette Committee's effort in fighting for American laborers with senate bills opposing oppressive labor practices. La Follette Committee and CIO At the start of the La Follett Committee's investigations, the Congress of Industrial Organizations launched its campaign to organize the mass production of the steel, automotive, and mining industries. By calling witnesses to the stand in an effort to expose American Industrial relations, the Committee supported the CIO, as both organizations strove to achieve a common goal of mass unionization. The ability of both organizations to operate in harmony allowed for their shared successes. When Myron Taylor of United States Steel publicly announced that his company would make a legal arrangement with the CIO, the La Follette Committee received wide spread acknowledgment and credit. Although it brought massive amounts of testimony which linked the succumbing of constitutional rights to anti-union policy, the findings of the La Follette Committee had already been previously noted by the Industrial Relations Commission's investigations predating World War I and the Interchurch World Movement analysis in 1919. Despite this, the committee's success and notoriety exceeded previous investigative organizations because of its affiliations with the CIO. However, its continued existence was not guaranteed and its affiliations with a larger, more well known association, such as the CIO, was necessary for its accomplishments. Similarly, the CIO had no way of securing itself a victory over oppressive labor practices, and the mutually beneficial associations shared among the two organizations proved vital. General Motors investigation The La Follette Committee's handling of General Motors (GM) exemplifies the struggles of workers whose intent of organizing made the company infringe upon their civil liberties. With word of oppressive practices, most notably espionage, reaching the founders of the committee before its official establishment, the decision to examine the events in Flint, Michigan, was a unanimous one. With intentions of bringing the tyrannical practices of the company to the attention of the public, the Committee obtained first hand reports of anti-union organizations in Flint. Reports obtained by the committee also confirmed the involvement of local law enforcement, as they maintained their own espionage system set to infiltrate sit-down strikes in the state. The La Follette Committee began its hearings of General Motors on February 15, with intentions of bolstering public opinion of the United Automobile Workers' (UAW) strikes (Auerbach 14). Accounts of spies infiltrating the UAW were disclosed at the hearing, as fifty-two members were reported as spies, relaying unionization efforts to those they worked for. Although word of the approval of the La Follette's investigation motivated the GM labor-relations director to hide all traces of the company's involvement with the union, mainly by erasing the evidence, the automobile company reported spending $839,764.41 in labor detective services, between 1934 and 1936. The hearings called for the testimony of rebellious spies and UAW organizers, such as Joseph B. Ditzel, to express their disapproval of GM labor policy and their negation of constitutional rights: \\"[Ditzel] could not rent a hall in Saginaw to address the automobile workers; a gang of toughs in Bay City forcibly detained him in his hotel room; he was trailed constantly in Flint before his car was sideswiped and three organizers were sent to the hospital with serious injuries\\". The committee's hearings uncovered the expenses of GM's espionage, its scrutiny of labor policies, and its mistreatment of workers, which publicly demonstrated the injustices toward the union. Congressional disputes resulted from the hearings as the La Follette Committee found legal success with a resolution by Key Pittman of Nevada; referring to the findings of the committee, Joseph Robinson added an amendment that rebuked any attempts at denying collective bargaining by employers and denounced their utilization of unfair labor practices. With the newly added amendment, a 75‚Äì3 vote approved the Pittman resolution by the Senate.

Once the canvas is mounted to the wall, pressure is exerted with rubber hand rollers to smooth the canvas and remove any bubbles. Uses =Conservation= In art conservation, the word can be term of art meaning the removal of the painted surface from its underlying support, usually a stretched canvas. The process is more typically called transferring and can cause significant damage. Twenty-first century conservators seldom need to resort to this technique. Murals Intended murals are normally painted on large canvas in the studio and attached to the wall on site, using a starch based glue (applied to the wall only), the murals can then be moved (by a professional) and re-instated elsewhere if required. The damage caused to the painting if removed using this technique is minimal. References *Mayer, Ralph.

The building housed the CBS Radio Network's West Coast facilities, as well as CBS's original Los Angeles radio stations, KNX and KCBS-FM. KNXT-TV, Channel 2 (now KCBS-TV) moved into the complex in 1960, and the CBS Television Network's West Coast operations were based there until it moved to the larger CBS Television City in November 1952. After its purchase by CBS in 2002, KCAL-TV moved to the Square from studios adjacent to CBS's corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Between 2004 and 2007 all of these operations moved to other facilities in the Los Angeles area. Architecture and dedication Columbia Square was built for KNX and as the Columbia Broadcasting System's West Coast operations headquarters on the site of the Nestor Film Company, Hollywood's first movie studio. The Christie Film Company eventually took over operation of Nestor Studios and filmed comedies on the site, originally the location of an early Hollywood roadhouse. Prior to moving to Columbia Square, KNX had been situated at several Hollywood locations. Columbia Square was designed by Swiss-born architect William Lescaze in the style of International Modernism and built over a year at a cost of two million dollars ‚Äî more money than had ever been spent on a broadcasting facility. Lescaze's sweeping streamline motifs, porthole windows and glass brick were true to Modernist design, though CBS President William Paley insisted the Square's form follow function. In his dedicatory speech, he remarked, \\"It is because we believe these new Hollywood headquarters, reflecting many innovations of design and acoustics and control, will improve the art of broadcasting that we have built them and are dedicating them here tonight.\\" Columbia Square opened April 30, 1938, with a full day of special broadcasts culminating in the star-studded evening special, \\"A Salute to Columbia Square\\" featuring Bob Hope, Al Jolson and Cecil B. DeMille. Crowds thronged Sunset Boulevard and a blimp bathed in searchlights hovered overhead as the program was carried coast-to-coast on the Columbia Broadcasting System, beamed to Europe via short wave, and carried across Canada on the CBC. On that premiere broadcast, Hope joked that Columbia Square looked like \\"the Taj Mahal with a permanent wave.\\" Jolson quipped, \\"It looks like Flash Gordon's bathroom.\\" The Square's original configuration included eight studios. Studios 1 through 4 were to the left of the main entrance. Upstairs were Studios 5 through 7 and at the rear of the forecourt was the large auditorium referred to as the \\"Columbia Playhouse\\" that seated 1050. In 1940, two new audience theatres were added to the east of the auditorium called \\"Studio B\\" and \\"Studio C\\" each seating approximately 350 people. Shows such as Jack Benny's Lucky Strike Program and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet originated from Studio B. Lucille Ball's My Favorite Husband, Blondie, and Dr. Christian are a few of the shows that broadcast from Studio C. When B and C were built, the Columbia Playhouse then took the letter designation of \\"Studio A\\". Studio A was home to The Silver Theatre, The Swan Show starring George Burns and Gracie Allen, The Lady Esther Screen Guild Players and countless others. The complex included Brittingham's Radio Center Restaurant, a men's clothing store, and a branch of the Bank of America. Tours of the studios cost 40 cents and passed by a glass-windowed control room housing Columbia's West Coast master control. \\"Columbia Square was one of the glories of radio. It was somewhat sacred to those in the industry. There was nothing comparable to its splendor in New York\\" says writer-producer Norman Corwin whose most famous broadcast, On a Note of Triumph, originated from the Square on VE Day, 1945. In early 2009, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission and the City Council designated CBS Columbia Square Studios as a historic-cultural monument. Programs Columbia Square became home to some of the best-known comedies of radio's golden age. Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton, Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks), Jack Oakie and Steve Allen sparked to the airways from the Square. Dramas included Suspense; Gunsmoke; and Man Behind the Gun, written, directed and produced by William N. Robson; Dr. Christian, \\"The Whistler\\", Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, The CBS Radio Workshop, where author Aldous Huxley introduced a production of Brave New World and Columbia Presents Corwin ‚Äî dramas produced by Norman Corwin. Musical acts that performed at Columbia Square included Eddie Cantor, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby and Gene Autry. Composer Bernard Hermann frequently scored and conducted Columbia Square broadcasts. Through the facilities of KNX, the Columbia network broadcast big band music from nearby ballrooms including the Hollywood Palladium and the Earl Caroll Theater. When The Bing Crosby Show moved to CBS in 1949 it took over space on the second floor of the east side of Columbia Square. A tape recording and editing facility also was built there to support the show. It was first facility of its kind to support a national radio show. The recording sessions and the audience shows were usually held in the CBS theater at 1615 Vine Street just north of Hollywood Boulevard. With the new three recorder facility, the radio show evolved from a cut and splice operation into one that was created from many different recording sessions with audience reactions incorporated. It was new territory explored by the Crosby team.https://ethw.org/First-Hand:The_Evolution_of_the_Bing_Crosby_Radio_Show In the late 1940s and early 1950s Columbia Square also served as a CBS television facility. In 1948, the first West Coast-based variety program, The Ed Wynn Show, was produced on Stage A. Lucille Ball's first national TV appearance took place on The Ed Wynn Show in December 1949 (aired on the East Coast just after New Year). Within the year Stage A would be the location of the shooting of the pilot episode of I Love Lucy. In the 2005 KNX broadcast, A Salute to Columbia Square, announcer George Walsh recalled crowds jamming the Square's forecourt for tickets to live broadcasts. (Ushers would sometimes walk down Sunset Boulevard to NBC's studios at Vine Street to urge audience members to watch a Columbia Square broadcast instead.) After their on-air appearances, actors would dash to the Radio Actors Telephone Exchange in the Square's lobby to check with their agents about their next bookings. Bob Crane was a top-rated KNX deejay at Columbia Square in the 1960s and James Dean worked as an usher. Some of the Square's once-luxurious radio theaters were converted to recording studios for Columbia Records where Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand and many other top stars recorded albums. Adaptive reuse KNX moved into new studios in the Miracle Mile neighborhood on L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard which it shares with Entercom Radio stations KFWB, KTWV, and KRTH. KNX, the last radio station to operate in Hollywood, moved after 67 years of operation at the Square just after 11:00 p.m. August 12, 2005, following a farewell broadcast from its Columbia Square studios. On April 21, 2007, KCBS- TV and KCAL-TV left the building and moved their operations to the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, thus ending Columbia Square's status as a broadcast facility, one of a very few remaining in Hollywood. The Square fell into disrepair during the years in which Laurence Tisch chaired CBS, and asbestos problems were cited as a reason to demolish the venue. Sungow Corp acquired Columbia Square in 2003 for $15 million. Las Vegas-based developer Molasky Pacific LLC, acquired the property in August 2006 for $66 million. It planned to redevelop the complex to continue to attract entertainment industry tenants and is considering options that would add some residential units to the office and broadcasting facility. The project is valued at $850-million and is the largest development project in Hollywood, California. The redevelopment of the historic CBS Studios on Sunset was approved in 2009 with a controversial 28-story tower. Developer Kilroy Realty Group acquired the project in 2012 and changed plans ‚Äî when completed the new Columbia Square will feature a 20-story residential tower with 200 apartments, of retail, three renovated historic structures, two new office buildings with an additional of space, and four and a half levels of underground parking. The development is currently under construction as of 2014. In fall 2007, producer Viacom, owner of CBS until 2006, chose the site for MTV's The Real World: Hollywood. The National Trust for Historic Preservation and Los Angeles Conservancy have been actively engaged in efforts to preserve the Hollywood landmark.

He lost his mother at age four, worked on his father's farm and went to school in the winter. Foss attended the Tilton Seminary, now Tilton School, before attending and graduating from Brown University in 1882. He would eventually be considered illustrious enough to warrant having his name inscribed on the mace. Beginning in 1898, he served as librarian at the Somerville Public Library in Massachusetts. He married a minister's daughter, with whom he had a daughter and son. Foss used to write a poem a day for the newspapers, and his five volumes of collected poetry are of the frank and homely ‚Äúcommon man‚Äù variety. Foss is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 114) along New Hampshire Route 43 in Candia. Influence For many years the opening lines from Foss's The Coming American (\\"Bring me men to match my mountains / Bring me men to match my plains / Men with empires in their purpose / And new eras in their brains\\") were inscribed on a granite wall at the United States Air Force Academy to inspire cadets and officers, but they were removed in 2003 after the Air Force Academy became coeducational. The poem is currently engraved and displayed at Epcot in Orlando, Florida, and also inscribed onto the Rocky Mountain Cup trophy, which is contested annually between Major League Soccer teams Real Salt Lake and Colorado Rapids. The first line of the poem is displayed prominently on the south facade of the Jesse M. Unruh State Office Building in Sacramento, California. Singer Lamya's song \\"Empires (Bring Me Men)\\" takes its opening lyrics from The Coming American, and the poem serves as inspiration for the rest of the song. Longtime baseball announcer Ernie Harwell alluded to Foss's The House by the Side of the Road whenever he described a batter taking a called third strike: \\"He stood there like the house by the side of the road and watched it go by.\\" A recitation of Foss's Two Gods provides the lyrics to the song \\"A Greater God\\" by MC 900 Ft.

Retrieved 26 January 2020 was an English television and radio presenter, racing driver, pilot and businessman. He died on 1 August 2014 from complications of a heart failure following major heart surgery. During the 1980s, he co-hosted BBC TV's Breakfast Time and was among rotating presenters of the music show Top of the Pops, broadcast on BBC One. Radio career Smith began his broadcasting career at Chelmsford Hospital Radio, before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1975 as a freelance producer and presenter. His work included promotions and production work for the Radio 1 Roadshow, Quiz Kid and most daytime network shows. As a standby DJ, Smith occasionally broadcast when live outside broadcasts failed. He joined London's Capital Radio in June 1978 and presented a variety of shows until July 1980, when he became the breakfast show presenter. He moved back to BBC Radio 1 in 1982, presenting the weekday early show from 6 to 7 am and a Saturday-morning show. In 1983, Smith took over the weekday lunchtime show from 11.30 am‚Äì2 pm until March 1984, when he briefly left to present BBC Breakfast Time. He returned to Radio 1 in May 1986, taking over from Mike Read on The Radio 1 Breakfast Show from 7.00 to 9.30 am, where he remained until almost exactly two years later when he left Radio 1 for good in 1988. Smith admitted to Chris Moyles in a BBC documentary aired in May 2010, When Moyles met The Radio 1 Breakfast DJs, he really missed being on the radio, but not television. Television career Smith's career as a television presenter included Thames TV's CBTV, BBC1 entertainment magazine and music chart shows Top of the Pops (1982-1988) Show Business (1983) and Friday's People (1985‚Äì87), Noel Edmonds' The Late, Late Breakfast Show (1984‚Äì86), That's Showbusiness (1989‚Äì96), and Julian Clary's Trick or Treat for ITV. Smith was one of BBC TV's presenters at Live Aid in 1985. He helped found Comic Relief and presented several of the charity's TV shows. Smith presented BBC TV's Railwatch, which was broadcast live for five days in February 1989. Other large outside broadcasts included Hospital Watch, Airport Watch and the BBC coverage of the Royal Tournament. Smith decided not to sign the licence extension that would allow the BBC to repeat the Top of the Pops episodes that he presented, with the BBC continuing to respect his wishes following his death. As a result, episodes featuring Smith have been omitted from the repeat run on BBC Four. Pilot Smith was a qualified helicopter pilot. He and his girlfriend (later his wife) Sarah Greene were injured on 10 September 1988 when the Robinson R22 Beta helicopter he was piloting (bearing the personal registration G-SMIF) crashed in Gloucestershire. Smith reported apparent unrecoverable loss of engine power whilst circling to reconnoitre an unfamiliar landing site. Both passengers survived, although Greene broke both legs and an arm, and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch neither criticised nor exonerated Smith in relation to the crash (it being beyond its remit to do so), concluding simply that \\"examination of the helicopter [including flight control, fuel, engine control, dynamic systems and the engine itself] revealed no failure or unserviceability that could have resulted in a loss of rotor speed.\\" Aerial filming company In 2004 Smith founded Flying TV, a company providing aerial filming services to broadcasters. As well as being Managing Director, Smith often acted as an aerial cameraman. Motor racing Driving from the age of 8, Smith raced at the age of 14 in grasstrack events, building his own cars. In 1972, aged 17, he passed his test and took up motorsports in racing, rallying and rallycross. In 1976, he progressed to Formula Ford 2000 with the Patrick Head-designed Sark. Smith was also a motorsport commentator, mainly at Brands Hatch where he also, age 21, ran the marketing operation. It was through that during this time he became interested in broadcasting. While still broadcasting Smith raced in several British Touring Car Championship races as well, driving a newly homologated Sierra Cosworth in 1987, and then alongside Frank Sytner in 1988 with whom he often clashed in a BMW M3. He also won the Willhire 24 Hour at Snetterton in 1986, driving a Ford Escort RS Turbo. Veteran commentator Murray Walker remarked that Smith \\"guaranteed action by the bucket-load\\". In 1989, Smith established a BTCC team known as Trakstar with Robb Gravett and Malcolm Swetnam. They ran two Sierra Cosworths, which had been imported from the Australian Touring Car stable of Dick Johnson. Gravett went on to become runner up in Group A, but Smith struggled with his recovery from the helicopter crash. However, loss of a major sponsor in 1990 meant that only one car could be run, which was raced by Robb Gravett who became champion. Smith never raced competitively again. Personal life Smith attended Ballyholme Primary School in Bangor, Northern Ireland during the early 1960s due to his father being relocated to Belfast by his employer, the Ford Motor Company. Having spent a short period at Bangor Grammar School, Smith attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, where he was the resident DJ at the school Friday night sixth form disco. He married Sarah Greene in 1989, soon after their 1988 helicopter crash. Smith died on 1 August 2014 from complications following major heart surgery. His wife of 25 years, TV presenter Sarah Greene, survives him.

The plot follows a college student who must make it from his campus in Los Angeles, California to his family's home in Larchmont, New York in time for Christmas dinner in order to win his father's Porsche. It stars Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Jessica Biel, Adam LaVorgna, Sean O'Bryan and Gary Cole and was released on November 13, 1998. Plot Jake Wilkinson (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), an 18-year-old attending the (fictional) in California boarding school, has not been home to Larchmont, New York for any holidays since his mother died and his father remarried 10 months later. A few days before Christmas Eve, his father offers to give him his vintage 1957 Porsche 356 if he is home by 6:00 PM Christmas Eve for Christmas dinner. Initially, Jake had traded in his airline ticket to New York City for two tickets to Cabo San Lucas to take his girlfriend Allie Henderson (Jessica Biel), who is also from New York. When she declines, Jake reconsiders his father's deal and retrades the tickets back to New York. Allie agrees to ride with him. With his trio of goons, Eddie Taffet (Adam LaVorgna), Jake's nemesis and rival for Allie's affections, leaves Jake in the desert dressed as Santa Claus to punish him for not getting an exam cheat sheet (a deal they had that Eddie secretly sabotaged on purpose). While Jake is stuck in the California desert, Eddie ends up giving a reluctant Allie a ride to New York after she thinks Jake bailed on her again. Jake has only three days to get to Larchmont if he wants the car. He stumbles upon Nolan (Andrew Lauer), a simple-minded thief who is driving stolen kitchen goods to his dealer near New York. A police officer named Max (Sean O'Bryan) pulls them over in Red Cliff, Colorado for speeding, so Jake lies that Nolan is his elf, Snowpuff, and they're donating the goods to the children's hospital. The officer invites them to accompany him to North Platte, Nebraska to help him win back his wife Marjorie (Lesley Boone). Meanwhile, Allie convinces Eddie to stay the night at a novelty hotel in a Bavarian village, the Amana Colonies in Amana, Iowa. They are unknowingly standing beneath mistletoe when a news anchor is reporting live. Jake sees them kiss while he's waiting at the bus station in Nebraska and develops a scheme to convince the bus driver to drop him off at the Bavarian village. He obtains a cooler and a slab of meat, writes Allie's name and address on the cooler, and convinces the whole busload that the cooler needs to be delivered to a little girl at the hospital in the Bavarian village for a transplant. After Allie lets Jake into her and Eddie's room, Eddie walks out of the shower only clad in a towel and Jake assumes he and Allie have slept together. Jake and Allie make up until Jake blurts out that Eddie prevented him from getting home by 6 PM. Upset that Jake cares more about the car than about her, Allie storms onto the bus and takes Jake's seat. Jake and Eddie drive off. Eddie suddenly becomes jealous realizing that Jake will get Allie and the Porsche if he makes it home, and throws Jake out of his car somewhere in Wisconsin. Jake decides to enter a Santa Claus race for a chance to win the $1,000 prize to buy an airline ticket to New York. Eddie is arrested after insulting (and possibly doing more) two policemen dressed as Christmas trees patrolling the race. While registering for the race, Jake meets a nice man named Jeff Wilson, whom he barely beats in the race. But en route to the airport, the taxi driver informs Jake that Jeff is actually the mayor of the town; he usually wins the race every year and uses the prize money to buy food for the impoverished. Jake feels bad and gives the money to the Mayor. Jake talks to his sister, who arranges for an airline ticket for him from Madison, Wisconsin. The airline doesn't let him board because he has no photographic identification, so he stows away in a dog kennel on a cargo aircraft with a large dog named Ringo. From the airport he hides on a train, tries to hitch a ride in a car, then steals a one-horse open sleigh from the local parade. When he reaches his street, he apologizes to Allie and they make up. Jake rides the sleigh home, arrives at 5:59 PM, and intentionally waits a few minutes to go inside so he isn't in time to get the Porsche. When his father offers it to him anyway, he refuses. He also finally accepts his stepmother. The Wilkinsons and Allie get into the sleigh just as the parade arrives and join the procession.

It lies along former U.S. Route 66 (now a county road west of the junction of Route 266 and Route 96), four miles (6 km) west of Halltown. Paris Springs Junction started as a few businesses on Route 66 and, with the decommissioning of that highway, has now become only homes. It was so named because of a former town named Paris Springs to the north. That town was founded in 1855 and survived until the time of Route 66's decommissioning. Paris Springs Paris Springs is located on Section 29 in Ozark Township at . The settlement was first known as Johnson's Mills. Clover Creek was used in the 1850s by the firm of Cherry & Johnson, J.R. Johnson and W.F. Likens for mill power, and turned out flour and meal from each of their mills. The mill distributed their products over a large trade area. Later there was O.P. Johnson's saw mill and woolen mill, also E.L. Davis chair factory. In the 1880s O.P. Johnson was postmaster. Paris Springs was a popular resort in the early part of the 1900s. The creek, was fed by several \\"chalybeate\\" or iron rich springs. A spring house sat in the middle of town, the ruins of which can still be found. It was about 20 x in size, with small stone walls laid out around the spring in a square. The spring house has a timber roof on a post and beam support. Not far from Paris Springs, is a large cave system, closed by the State of Missouri, to preserve its natural beauty and wildlife. Elbridge Basswell Scott, was the Pastor of the Methodist Church. The church is one of the last public buildings left standing in the old town site. Pastor Scott was a general contractor and is said to have built the church in Paris Springs, Butterfield, and several other communities. Making his home in Paris Springs, he was a \\"Circuit Rider,\\" was a pastor who traveled throughout an area or \\"Circuit.\\" This system allowed for churches to be active in villages that would normally be too small to support a regular pastor or church. Pastor Scott died in a construction accident in Purdy, Missouri. Hundreds of people from around the region attended his funeral. Little remains of the old town since the closing of Route 66.

STCW was adopted in 1978 by conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London, and entered into force in 1984. The Convention was significantly amended in 1995. The 1978 STCW Convention was the first to establish minimum basic requirements on training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers on an international level. Previously the minimum standards of training, certification and watchkeeping of officers and ratings were established by individual governments, usually without reference to practices in other countries. As a result, minimum standards and procedures varied widely, even though shipping is extremely international by nature. The Convention prescribes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers which countries are obliged to meet or exceed.IMO Model Courses The Convention did not deal with manning levels: IMO provisions in this area are covered by regulation 14 of Chapter V of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, whose requirements are backed up by resolution A.890(21) Principles of safe manninghttp://www.imo.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/Assembly/Documents/A.890(21).pdf, adopted by the IMO Assembly in 1999, which replaced an earlier resolution A.481(XII)http://www.imo.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/Assembly/Documents/A.481(12).pdf adopted in 1981 and has since been itself replaced by resolution A.1047(27) Principles of Minimum Safe Manninghttp://www.imo.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/Assembly/Documents/A.1047(27).pdf, adopted by the IMO Assembly in 2011. One especially important feature of the Convention is that it applies to ships of non-party States when visiting ports of States which are Parties to the Convention. Article X requires Parties to apply the control measures to ships of all flags to the extent necessary to ensure that no more favourable treatment is given to ships entitled to fly the flag of a State which is not a Party than is given to ships entitled to fly the flag of a State that is a Party. The difficulties which could arise for ships of States which are not Parties to the Convention is one reason why the Convention has received such wide acceptance. By 2018, the STCW Convention had 164 Parties, representing 99.2 per cent of world shipping tonnage. 1995 revision On 7 July 1995, the IMO adopted a comprehensive revision of STCW. It also included a proposal to develop a new STCW Code, which would contain the technical details associated with provisions of the Convention. The amendments entered force on 1 February 1997.International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Full implementation was required by 1 February 2002. Mariners already holding certification had the option to renew the certificates in accordance with the old rules of the 1978 Convention during the period ending on 1 February 2002. Mariners entering training programs after 1 August 1998 are required to meet the competency standards of the new 1995 Amendments. The most significant amendments concerned: *a) enhancement of port state control; *b) communication of information to IMO to allow for mutual oversight and consistency in application of standards, *c) quality standards systems (QSS), oversight of training, assessment, and certification procedures, **The Amendments require that seafarers be provided Manila Amendments The IMO Convention on Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping of Seafarers adopted a new set of amendments in Manila in 2010 called \\"The Manila Amendments\\". These amendments were necessary to keep training standards in line with new technological and operational requirements that require new shipboard competencies. The Manila Amendments were effective as of 1 January 2012. There is a transition period until 2017 when all seafarers must be certified and trained according to the new standards. Implementation is progressive, every year a modified set of requirements comes into force. The most significant amendments are: * New rest hours for seafarers * New grades of certificates of competency for able seafarers in both deck and engine * New and updated training, refreshing requirements * Mandatory security training * Additional medical standards * Specific Alcohol limits in blood or breath. STCW-F Convention On 7 July 1995, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel was adopted as a separate treaty as part of the comprehensive revisions to STCW. It applies the principles of STCW to fishing vessels from ratifying states that are 24 metres in length and above. STCW-F came into force on 29 September 2012.STCW-F Convention, imo.org.

produce a flat but rough (matte) finish, in which the glass is in small sharp fragments. Ground glass surfaces have many applications, ranging from ornamentation on windows and table glassware to scientific uses in optics and laboratory glassware. Uses =Photography= In photography, a sheet of ground glass is used for the manual focusing in some still and movie cameras; the ground-glass viewer is inserted in the back of the camera, and the lens opened to its widest aperture. This projects the scene on the ground glass upside down. The photographer focuses and composes using this projected image, sometimes with the aid of a magnifying glass (or loupe). In order to see the image better, a dark cloth is used to block out light, whence came the image of the old-time photographer with his head stuck under a large black cloth. A ground glass is also used in the reflex finder of an SLR or TLR camera. In motion-picture cameras, the ground glass is a small, usually removable piece of transparent glass that sits between the rotary disc shutter and the viewfinder. The ground glass usually contains precise markings to show the camera operator the boundaries of the frame or the center reticle, or any other important information. Because the ground glass is positioned between the mirror shutter and the viewfinder, it does not interfere with the image reaching the film and is therefore not recorded over the final image, but rather serves as a reference for the camera operator. Ground glasses commonly serve as a framing reference for a desired aspect ratio. Because most films shot with spherical lenses are shot full-frame and later masked during projection to a more widescreen aspect ratio, it is important not only for the operator to be able to see the boundaries of that aspect ratio, but also for the ground glass to be properly aligned in the camera so that the markings are an exact representation of the boundaries of the image recorded on film. =Lighting= Ground or frosted glass is widely used as a weather- and heat- proof light diffuser in ambient lighting, namely on glass covers or enclosures for lamp fixtures, and sometimes on incandescent bulbs. Its functions include reducing glare and preventing retinal damage by direct sight of the lamp filament. This hides unsightly details of the lamp and fixture without blocking its light, yielding a softer illumination without giving hard shadows. =Chemistry= Ground glass surfaces are often found on the glass equipment of chemical laboratories. Glass flasks, stoppers, valves, funnels, and tubing are often connected together by ground glass joints, matching pairs of conical or spherical surfaces that have been ground to a precise shape. Flasks and test tubes often have a small ground-glass label area on the side. (Pencil writing on ground glass is largely inert, rub-proof and waterproof, but can be easily erased.) =Technical optics= An optical microscope may include a ground- or frosted-glass diffuser to evenly illuminate the field behind the specimen. Microscope slides are often ground on the sides and beveled on the corners to soften the edges for safer handling. Poison Popular belief for many centuries is that ground-up glass (i.e., glass broken into tiny fragments) can kill if swallowed. In fact, this is a myth, as it is largely ineffective. The Guy de Maupassant short story \\"La Confession\\" concerns a jealous girl who poisons her older sister's suitor by inserting ground-up glass into cake.

The oriflamme can be seen on the top left. The Oriflamme (from Latin aurea flamma, \\"golden flame\\") was the battle standard of the King of France in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the Abbey of St. Denis, a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the Hundred Years War, no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.Robert Southey (1841) Joan of Arc: a poem, Longman et autres. p. 280 In French, the term \\"oriflamme\\" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends, by association with the form of the original. Legendary origin The Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the Chanson de Roland (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called Romaine and then Montjoie. According to legend, Charlemagne carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the Saracens. This suggests that the lance was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.Heraldica.org  History  The Oriflamme was first used by Louis VI in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,Richard W. Barber (1984) The Penguin guide to medieval Europe, Penguin Books. p. 224 though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century. Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by King Dagobert. Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the Comte de Vexin, who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it into combat. It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns: *Bouvines 1214 *Seventh Crusade 1248 *Mons-en- P√©v√®le 1304 *Cr√©cy 1346 *Poitiers 1356 *Roosebeke 1382 *Agincourt 1415 The Oriflamme was lost at least four times during its medieval history; Mons-en- P√©v√®le,DeVries, Kelly (2006) : Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century. Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, p.40 Cr√©cy, Poitiers, and during the campaigns of the Seventh Crusade under King Louis IX.Edward Cowan (2012) The Wallace Book, Birlinn Although the Oriflamme has often been depicted as present at the battle of Agincourt, modern historians have disputed this. The banner was given to Guillaume de Martel by Charles VI on September 10 1415, and carried by Martel from Paris to Rouen. Barker (2005) This was likely an attempt to raise French morale and rally troops, however there is no evidence that the Oriflamme was then taken on campaign and unfurled at Agincourt.Curry, Anne. The Battle of Agincourt: Sources and Interpretations (2000) p.353 Modern historians agree that the Oriflamme was not carried by Martel at Agincourt, as the king was not present at the battle in person.Strickland, Matthew, in Curry, A. Mercer, M. (eds) The Battle of Agincourt (2015) pp.36-7 Cooper, Stephen. Agincourt: Myth and Reality, 1915-2015 (2014) pp.37-8  Appearance  The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.Slater (2002), p.33 According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded St. Denis. The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the \\"Chronicle of Flanders\\" (fourteenth century), in the \\"Registra Delphinalia\\" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.  Significance on the battlefield  When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield, it indicated that no quarter was to be given: its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity. Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of St. Martin of Tours) strewn with gold fleur-de-lis remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of Joan of Arc became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field. Porte oriflamme The bearer of the standard, the porte-oriflamme, became an office (like that of Marshal or Constable) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle. If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die, rather than relinquish his charge. Froissart vividly describes porte-oriflamme Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage: > There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his > fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him > because he was carrying the king‚Äôs sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also > had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many > English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open > the king‚Äôs battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and > Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] > gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in > his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.Jean Froissart; trans > Geoffrey Brereton, Chronicles ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. > 247 = Notable Bearers of the Oriflamme = *Geoffroi de Charny - 14th-century knight and author of several works on chivalry. He first bore the Oriflamme during the failed attempt to relieve Calais in 1347 and died at Poitiers defending it.Green (2004), p.56 *Arnoul d'Audrehem - 14th-century former Marshal of France. He held the office from 1368 to his death in 1370 but never carried the banner in action. *Guillaume de Martel - Seigneur de Bacqueville. He carried the Oriflamme at Agincourt and died there.Barker (2005), p.323 *Sir Pierre de Villiers carried the Oriflamme at the Battle of Roosebeke against the Flemish rebels of Ghent led by Philip van Artvelde in 1382.  The Oriflamme in literature  In canto XXXI of Paradiso, Dante describes the Virgin Mary in the Empyrean as pacifica oriafiamma (Musa's translation, \\"oriflame of peace\\") The 19th-century poet Robert Southey refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem Joan of Arc The 20th-century Martiniquais poet and politician, Aim√© C√©saire (1913-2008) invokes the Oriflamme in his poem \\"Your Hair\\" (\\"Chevelure\\"). By invoking the Oriflamme, C√©saire also invokes the French Colonial Empire, war, and oppression. The poem is included in The Collected Poetry of Aim√© C√©saire. An excerpt reads:  The Oriflamme in popular culture  In the television series \\"Vikings\\", in series 3, episode 8 (\\"To the gates!\\"), the Oriflamme is raised during the siege of Paris.

Horne and supervised by Leo McCarey from a McCarey (uncredited) and H. M. Walker script. The film, largely about tit-for-tat vandalism between Laurel and Hardy as Christmas tree salesmen and the man who rejects them, was deemed culturally significant and entered into the National Film Registry in 1992.  Plot  Stan and Ollie play door-to-door Christmas tree salesmen in California ‚Äì in the summer. They end up getting into an escalating feud with grumpy would-be customer James Finlayson. He, goaded by their repeated attempts to sell him a Christmas tree, destroys it with hedge-clippers. Laurel & Hardy retaliate by damaging the man's doorframe with a knife. Finlayson then goes to work on their clothes, and this escalates, with his home and their car being destroyed in the melee (after Finlayson has run out of Christmas trees to mangle). A police officer (Tiny Sandford) steps in to stop the fight (after vases are thrown out and smashed, and one hits him on the foot) and negotiates a peaceful resolution. Stan and Ollie give the homeowner a cigar as a peace offering. However, as the pair make their escape, the trick cigar promptly explodes in his face.  Production  Producer Hal Roach bought a vacant house at 10281 Dunleer Drive, Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles from a studio worker so he could destroy it in the film. According to Roach, a mistake was made regarding the address‚Äîand the cast and crew demolished the house next door instead. The owners of that home happened to be away on vacation and returned just as filming was wrapping up. Stan Laurel later said that Roach's story was a fabrication. However, Roach, at age 100, repeated the story as factual during a 1992 guest appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

An example of this is the writings of Hasan and Husayn, two grandchildren of Muhammad by the calligrapher Kazasker Mustafa ƒ∞zzed Effendi with Islamic calligraphy in Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, Turkey. Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ TƒÅlib (, 599 ‚Äì 661 ACE) was an early Islamic leader. Ali is revered by Sunni Muslims as the fourth Rightly Guided Caliphs, and as a foremost religious authority on the Qur'an and Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). Shi'a Muslims consider him the First Imam appointed by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the first rightful caliph. Ali was the cousin of Muhammad, and after marriage to Fatimah he also became Muhammad's son-in-law. His descendants through Fatimah are revered today in Shia and Sunnis as Sayyids. His father was Abu Talib and his mother was Fatima bint Asad, but he was raised in the household of Muhammad, who himself was raised by Abu Talib, Muhammad's uncle. When Muhammad reported receiving a divine revelation, Ali was the first child to accept his message and first to convert to Islam at the age of 12, dedicating his life to the cause of Islam. In Muslim culture, Ali is respected for his courage, knowledge, belief, honesty to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies, and therefore is central to mystical traditions in Islam such as Sufism. Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought. Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders which trace their lineage through him to Muhammad. Ali's influence has been important throughout Islamic history.

The Sri Chakra, frequently called the Sri Yantra. The Saundarya Lahari () meaning \\"The waves of Beauty\\" is a famous literary work in Sanskrit believed to be written by sage Adi Shankara. Some believe the first part \\"Ananda Lahari\\" was etched on mount Meru by Ganesha himself (or by Pushpadanta). Sage Gaudapada, the teacher of Shankar's teacher Govinda Bhagavadpada, memorised the writings of Pushpadanta which was carried down to Adi Shankara. Its hundred and three shlokas (verses) eulogize the beauty, grace and munificence of Goddess Parvati / Dakshayani, consort of Shiva. W. Norman Brown translated it to English which was published as volume 43 of the Harvard Oriental Series in 1958. History Saundarya Lahari originated in Kashmir. Tantra \\"textbook\\" The Saundarya Lahari is not only the collection of holy hymns, but also a tantra textbook, giving instructions Puja on Sri-Yantra and worshiping methods, 100 different hymns, 100 different yantra, almost one to each shloka; describes the appropriate tantra method of performing devotion connected to each specific shloka; and details the results ensuring therefrom. There are many interpretations and commentaries but best of these are arguably those that provide word-to-word translations, as also the yantra, the devotion to be performed and the results of the devotion. Two parts It is once said that Adi Shankara visited Kailash to worship Shiva and Parvati. There, the Lord gave him a manuscript containing 100 verses which described the many facets of the Goddess, as a gift to him. While Shankara was returning after visiting Kailash, Nandi stopped him on the way. He snatched the manuscript from him, tore it into two, took one part and gave the other to Shankara. Shankara, desolate, ran to Shiva and narrated the incident to him. Shiva, smiling, commanded him to retain the 41 verses with him as the initial part of the 100 verses and then, write an extra 59 verses in praise of the Goddess himself. Thus, verses 1 - 41 are the original work of Lord Shiva, shedding great light on the ancient rituals of Tantra, Yantra and various powerful Mantra. Verses 1 - 41 describe the mystical experience of the union of Shiva and Shakti and related phenomena. In fact, it opens with the assertion that Only when Shiva is united with Shakti does he have the power to create. The remaining verses, i.e. 42-100 are composed by Adi Shankara himself, which mainly focuses on the appearance of the Goddess. All the 100 verses are collectively known as 'Soundarya Lahari'. The Soundarya Lahari is not only a poem. It is a tantra textbook, giving instructions on Puja and offerings, many yantra, almost one to each shloka; describing the tantra technique of performing devotion connected to each specific shloka; and details the results ensuing therefrom. There are many interpretations and commentaries but best of these are arguably those that provide word-to-word translations, as also the yantra, the devotion to be performed and the results of the devotion. Verses 42-100 are more straightforward; they describe the physical beauty of the Goddess and are sometimes referred to as the Soundarya Lahari itself. Many scholars, however, refer to the entire text with one name, namely, Soundarya Lahari. =Concept of Kundalini= First 41 verses cover the detailed account of internal worship of the Mother. It consists of systematic exposition of the concept of kundalini, Sri Chakra, mantra (verses 32, 33). This depicts the Supreme Reality as non-dual but with a distinction between Shiva and Shakti, the power holder and Power, Being and Will. The Power, that is, the Mother or Maha Tripura Sundari, becomes the dominant factor and the power holder or Shiva becomes a substratum. The first verse itself clearly describes this idea. \\"United with Shakti, Shiva is endowed with power to create; or otherwise, he is incapable of even a movement.\\" The same idea is brought out in verse 24, \\"Brahma creates the universe, Vishnu sustains, Rudra destroys, and Maheshwar absorbs every thing and assimilates into Sadashiva. On receiving mandate from thy creeper like brows, Sadasiva restores everything into activity as in the previous cycle.\\" Such dominance of the Mother can be seen in verses 34 and 35 also. =Legend= There are several legends about this work. One legend says that, once Adi Shankara visited Kailash to worship Shiva and Parvati. There, the Lord gave him a manuscript containing 100 verses which described the many facets of the Goddess, as a gift to him. While Shankara was returning after visiting Kailash, Nandi stopped him on the way. He snatched the manuscript from him, tore it into two, took one part and gave the other to Shankara. Shankara, desolate, ran to Shiva and narrated the incident to him. Shiva, smilingly, commanded him to retain the 41 verses with him as the initial part of the 100 verses and then, write an extra 59 verses in praise of the Goddess himself. Thus, verses 1 - 41 are the original work of Lord Shiva, shedding great light on the ancient rituals of Tantra, Yantra and various powerful Mantra. The remaining verses, i.e. 42-100 are composed by Adi Shankara himself, which mainly focuses on the appearance of the Goddess. Yet another legend says that once when Adi Shankara was visiting Kailash, Lord Shiva was writing about the beauty of Goddess Parvati on the walls of their home. Shiva rubbed what he wrote as he didn't want Adi Shankara who was an outsider reading about the beauty of his wife. But Adi Shankara had seen some part of the writings and with his superior mind recollected the rest. Thus, he composed the Soundarya Lahari(waves of beauty of the Devi). =Commentaries= There are more than 36 commentaries on the Soundarya Lahari in Sanskrit itself. Among the better known are commentaries by Lakshmidhara, Kameshvarasuri (viz. Arunamodini), Kaivalyashrama (viz. Sowbagyavardhini) and Dindima. =Translations= Saundarya Lahari was translated into Tamil in the 12th century by Virai Kaviraja Pandithar. He titled the book Abhirami Paadal. There are many English translations with commentaries on Soundarya Lahari done by various authors. * Pandit S.

Founded in 1997 by Jamie Hyneman, it specialized in producing props for movies and television. Following the conclusion of filming the Mythbusters series, it became a research and development firm.  History  In 1997, Jamie Hyneman took over the Colossal Pictures workshop, using it to establish M5 Industries.http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/mythbusters3.htm \\"MythBusters\\" Shop: M5 Industries, HowStuffWorks The company originally produced special effects props for film, including animatronic puppets, such as those seen in James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas. M5 Industries has produced special effects for many commercials, such as a motorized 7 Up soft drink vending machine that shoots soda cans at people and a remote-controlled shoe for Nike. The facilities were used extensively for the production of the television show MythBusters, with the M5 Industries workshop used as the primary shooting location for the first season. During the second season, when a second team of MythBusters was introduced, a second space located at 2200 Jerrold Avenue in San Francisco, dubbed \\"M7\\" was leased for them. Many of the people who appear on MythBusters were originally employees of M5, notably Kari Byron. Since the end of production for Mythbusters, the company no longer does special effects for movies and television, now focusing on research and development, like a tank against wildfire. The workshop does not offer tours or allow visits from the public because of insurance issues.  Name  The company's name was suggested by Adam Savage. He intended to suggest the name of either the branch of the British secret service which built gadgets in James Bond fiction (Q Branch) or British secret service itself (MI6), but was mistaken as to the correct name, and suggested M5.

History  Sprint originally appeared as the \\"FinalWord\\" application, developed by Jason Linhart, Craig Finseth, Scott Layson Burson, Brian Hess, and Bill Spitzak at Mark of the Unicorn - a company (headquartered in Cambridge, MA) which is now better known for its music software products. At the time MOTU sold MINCE and SCRIBBLE, a text editor package based on Emacs. As The FinalWord, the package met with some success: for example, the manuals of the Lotus software package were written on it, as was Marvin Minsky's book The Society of Mind. FinalWord II was renamed Sprint when it was acquired by Borland, which added a new user interface, new manuals, and features to the application. The editor speed was considered blazing at the time, running with no delays on machines as slow as 8 megahertz. This was the time of European development for Borland: Sidekick and Turbo Pascal had been founded in Denmark; and the management of the European subsidiary comprised former Micropro France managers (Micropro was at the time the world leader in Word processing software with the famous WordStar line-up. They had success with the launch of WordStar 2000 - the first word processor package with a spelling dictionary in French.) This is why the development and marketing of the product was conducted in France. Sprint is one of the very few major products from an American software publisher that had a French version shipped before the American version. Sprint v1.0 shipped in France with notable initial success, capturing a 30 percent market share and getting the jump on competing word processors. MicroPro was weakening with old Wordstar products and still-new WordStar 2000; WordPerfect was having problems with the translation and the user interface; and MS-Word was a decent but less polished or powerful product, and was also DOS and text-based. The lack of beta-test combined with pressure to ship for back-to-school time resulted in a Sprint 1.0 which had a number of minor glitches and bugs that had to be corrected with version 1.01 and a whole new set of diskettes for every single registered user. Version 1.0 (equivalent of French 1.01) shipped a few months later in the US and rest of world, with a mixed reception from customers. Traditional Borland fans who bought Sprint were happy with the editor, but wondered why the package included a sophisticated formatter, while business users who wanted a word processor just to write their memos and letters wondered what to do with the heavy manual and powerful features of the formatter language. In any event, word processing was shifting to WYSIWYG. Version 1.5 did ship with a number of new features and real stability in France, but never made it elsewhere, although a number of localized versions had been built for various European countries. At this time, Borland Scandinavia had gone bankrupt, while Borland France had to be saved by massive financial help from the US. The developers who once worked in Europe had to move to the Scotts Valley CA premises. Version 1.5 was a reasonable success in France for some years, but Microsoft Word and Windows gained momentum and obscured all the other products. In North America, Sprint never really gained traction in the marketplace, as it was overshadowed by WordPerfect and then Microsoft Word. It built up a small, but loyal and often enthusiastic, following among professional writers, researchers, academics, and programmers who appreciated its power, speed, and ability to handle large documents. Borland did not believe that there was enough of a market to warrant updating the product, and it eventually stopped supporting it.  Features  Crash-recovery: Sprint had incremental back-up, with its swap file updated every 3 seconds, enabling full recovery from crashes. At trade shows, demos were made with one person pulling out the power cord, and the typist resuming work as soon as the machine restarted. Spell-as-you-type: With this feature, Sprint could beep at you in real time when detecting a typo. Multilingual editing: Sprint included dictionary switching, support for hyphenation, and spelling and thesaurus dictionaries that have yet to be matched by the competitors. Separate formatter and programmable editor: These have been useful features for corporate environments aiming at standardizing documents or building \\"boilerplate\\" contracts. In France, for example, applications were built for Banques Populaires (loan contracts) or Conseil d'Etat, while some local government agencies created specific applications for tenders and contracts. Powerful programming language: Programming in Sprint was done with the internal language of the word processor - a language that is much like C. Programmers have the ability to \\"get under the hood\\" and add modifications and extensions to an extent not possible with other word processors. Once written, Sprint programs are compiled into the interface, and run at full speed. Interface switching: Modifications and extensions to Sprint can be saved into separate interfaces which can be easily and quickly switched. This is useful for people working in different languages, as the keys can be mapped to the accents and characters of each language, depending on the interface. File handling: Users could work in up to 24 files at once. All open files could be saved on exit or not‚Äîand nevertheless automatically reopened as left, including each file's cursor position, cut and paste buffer contents, and spell check status. Because this behavior was accomplished using the crash- recovery swap file (see above), it allowed an \\"instant-on\\" behavior using the saved state from the previous run; this was unusual for its time. Handling large documents: Sprint has the ability to publish large documents (hundreds of pages) with strict formatting consistency and automatic table of contents, index generation, tables of figures, and tables of authorities. These features made Sprint a leader in the production of technical documents - and Borland itself did all its manuals on Sprint, for years. PostScript capabilities: Sprint could print in-line EPS images with dimensioning, and also had the ability to add in-line PostScript procedures. This made the product rather popular in the printing industry. For example, making a 200-page novel fit into 192 pages was simply a matter of changing the point size from 11 to 10.56. Sprint could size by 0.04 increment and scale the line spacing and kerning accordingly. (The 192 pages size is important in the printing industry, where the number of pages often has to be divisible by 32. A 200-page book would have to be printed using 224 pages, the extra 24 pages being empty.) Consistency with familiar environments: The default editor key bindings were a subset of those provided by EMACS, and the mark-up language was a subset of Scribe, making it easy for people familiar with those tools to use Sprint. Reception BYTE in 1984 praised FinalWord 1.16's low memory requirements and many powerful features. Criticisms included great difficulty in learning how to use it and instability, including a serious bug that destroyed four days of work. The magazine in 1989 listed Sprint as among the \\"Distinction\\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that \\"if you can live without [WYSIWYG], Sprint may be all you need in word processing software\\".

It was the first parliamentary election to be held since the formation of the Third Republic, the first entirely free and competitive legislative election since the fall of communism, the first completely free legislative election of any sort since 1928, and only the fifth completely free election in all of Polish history. Due to the collapse of the Solidarity movement's political wing, the 1991 election saw deep political fragmentation, with a multitude of new parties and alliances emerging in its wake. Low voting thresholds within individual constituencies, along with a five percent national threshold allocated to a small portion of the Sejm, additionally contributed to party fragmentation. As a result, 29 political parties gained entry into the Sejm and 22 in the Senate, with no party holding a decisive majority. Two months of intense coalition negotiations followed, with Jan Olszewski of the Centre Agreement forming a minority government along with the Christian National Union, remnants of the broader Center Civic Alliance, and the Peasants' Agreement, with conditional support from Polish People's Party, Solidarity and other minor parties. 460 members of parliament (pose≈Ç) were elected; 391 from 6980 candidates from 37 regional lists of candidates and 69 from country-wide lists of candidates.

After his playing career concluded, he served as an assistant coach at Florida Southern and then was elevated to the head coach position on May 9, 2012. He is the son of former MLB pitcher Joe Niekro and nephew of former MLB pitcher Phil Niekro. Career =High School and College= Born in Winter Haven, Florida, Niekro graduated from George W. Jenkins High School in Lakeland, Florida, and attended Florida Southern College. While in high school, he had transitioned from being a knuckleball pitcher to a position player, playing third base at Florida Southern. In 1999 and 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), and was named league MVP in 1999.

He fought under General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna during the Texas Revolution. Urrea's forces were never defeated in battle during the Texas Revolution. His most notable success was that of the Goliad Campaign, in which James Fannin's 400 soldiers were surrounded and induced to capitulate under terms, but were massacred in Urrea's absence on the orders of Santa Anna.The Goliad Massacre, Presidio La Bahia , Goliad, Texas, Presidio Nuestra Senora De Loreto De La Bahia, Friends of the Fort website, accessed 28 Oct 2006\\" Urrea also fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Early life Urrea was born at the Presidio Real de San August√≠n de Tucs√≥n (now the U.S. city of Tucson, Arizona), during Spanish regime of the region. Despite being born on the northern frontier of Mexico, his family had deep roots in the state of Durango. Military career In 1807 Urrea entered the Spanish army. In 1824 he rose to the rank of captain, but he resigned from the army and entered private life. In 1829 he rejoined the military as a major and helped to liberate the city of Durango, allying himself with Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna.Roell (2013), p. 70. He was promoted to colonel for his actions. In 1835 he reluctantly took part in Santa Anna's attack on the state of Zacatecas (the state had openly rebelled against his rise to power). Santa Anna promoted Urrea to Brigadier General for his role in this. Texas Revolution When the Mexican state of Texas also revolted against Santa Anna's Centralist government, Urrea was sent there to help put down the colonists. He easily defeated small groups of Texan forces at the Battle of San Patricio, Battle of Refugio, and Battle of Coleto. The last, also known as the \\"Goliad Massacre\\", included the deliberate slaughter of Texans who had surrendered. The execution of prisoners, however, was not Urrea's choice, but an order by General Santa Anna.. Due to Urrea's string of victories, Santa Anna decided to stay in Texas and personally finish off the rebellious Texas government. His motives were personal and politicalEdmondson (2000), p. 287. as Urrea was getting all the headlines and would be seen back in Mexico as a more popular figure. Aftermath The military defeat of Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836 resulted in Santa Anna's capture, and him being forced to order all Mexican forces to withdraw from Texas soil. Urrea was infuriated and, after linking up with Vicente Filisola's forces, he wanted to continue the war against the Texans since the Mexicans still had over 2,500 troops in Texas against less than 900 of Sam Houston's Texans. But both Urrea and Filisola had no choice but to comply with Santa Anna's orders, so by the middle of June, Urrea and all Mexican forces had withdrawn from Texas. The Mexican authorities criticized Filisola for leading the retreat, stripped him of his command, and made Urrea the new commander of the army. Within a few months, Urrea gathered an army of 6,000 troops near Matamoros to finally reconquer Texas. However, the invasion never occurred as he and his troops were redirected to address several federalist rebellions across Mexico. In 1837, Urrea turned against Santa Anna upon his return to Mexico, and fought against him at the Battle of Mazatl√°n in 1838. The attempted uprising resulted in his eventual arrest, and he was sent to Perote Prison. He later revived his military career with the invasion of French forces into Mexico, and another failed coup attempt followed. The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War saw Urrea leading a cavalry division against invading American troops. Urrea died August 1, 1849 of cholera shortly after the war ended.

He began his career as an actor under director Sidney Olcott at Kalem Studios in 1913 and directed his first film for the company two years later. Silent era During the silent-era Horne specialized in staging thrill scenes for features and serial films. On the strength of Horne's work in Cruise of the Jasper B, Buster Keaton hired him to direct his 1927 comedy College. From there he moved to Hal Roach Studios, where he worked with Roach's leading stars, Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase, Our Gang, and his nephew George Stevens, who worked at the studio as a cinematographer, who later progressed to directing short films, and from the late 1930s became a top Hollywood feature filmmaker. Horne's Laurel and Hardy comedies Big Business (credited to \\"J. Wesley Horne\\") and Way Out West are acclaimed as classics. Horne also displayed an aptitude for directing Roach's foreign-language versions; the American version might be staged by James Parrott, for example, but the international version would be entrusted to Horne. Horne left Roach in 1932 during an economic downturn that eliminated many jobs. He was hired by Universal Pictures where, for the next few years, he directed the studio's now-obscure two-reel comedies. When Universal suspended production, Horne worked briefly at Columbia Pictures and returned to Roach in 1935. Serials In 1937 Columbia, noting the popularity of serials, decided to enter the field. At first the studio simply picked up the independent productions of the Weiss Brothers' \\"Adventure Serials\\" company, but by 1938 Columbia wanted to produce serials with its own actors, technicians, and facilities. Former serial specialist James Horne co-directed (with Ray Taylor) the first of Columbia's own serials, and it turned out to be one of the studio's best. The Spider's Web, starring Warren Hull as a masked crimefighter, was the most popular serial of 1938, surpassing such well- received serials as Buck Rogers and Dick Tracy Returns by a wide margin, according to a tally published in The Motion Picture Herald. James W. Horne Photoplay (Dec. 1915) This cemented Horne's position in Columbia's serial squad, and he directed cliffhangers exclusively (and without assistance) for the rest of his life. This job security seems to have prompted Horne to indulge his sense of humor, because most of his Columbia serials are tongue- in-cheek. Horne had his actors play their roles straight for the first three chapters‚Äîthese would be the sample episodes used to sell the serial to exhibitors. Then, starting with Chapter 4, Horne would stray farther and farther from the straight melodramatic path, encouraging his actors to ham it up with overly dramatic readings, and staging ridiculous fight scenes (the hero would take on six thugs simultaneously and win). Horne kept the action barely serious enough to satisfy action fans, and in fairness to Horne many of his cliffhanging perils are very effectively staged. But the overall tone of Horne's serials is mock-serious, with urgent narration recapping the action (the 1960s Batman TV series copied Horne's style). The Green Archer, which Horne co-wrote as well as directed, is probably the most satirically enjoyable of Horne's serials.

He was born in Epsom, Surrey, England to middle-class parents, and was educated at Bradfield College and New College, Oxford, where he studied classics and attained a double first, graduating in 1935.  Life  Reese's father, the son of a Welsh clergyman, worked in a bank until he transferred to his wife's family catering business. Reese said \\"I played card games before I could read\\".Reese (1977), p. 1. As a small boy, when his mother \\"issued the standard warning about not talking to strange men, my father remarked that it was the strange men who should be warned against trying to talk to me\\". Reese's mother Anne ran a hotel near Guildford, and with it a bridge club, so Reese played in the earliest duplicate matches, circa 1930. Whilst at Oxford he met some serious bridge players, amongst whom were Lt.-Col. Walter Buller, Iain Macleod and Maurice Harrison-Gray, the strongest player in the country at that time. Within a year of graduating and after a brief stint at Harrod's, Reese started working for Hubert Phillips's magazine and co-wrote his first book with him in 1937.Phillips, Hubert, and Terence Reese (1937). The Elements of Contract. London: British Bridge World. 271 pages. Phillips acknowledges that although the book is published jointly under their names, \\"Terence is the real author of the book\\",Phillips and Reese (1937), Introduction by Phillips, p. vii. receiving only assistance in planning contents and editing from Phillips. From that point on, Reese's profession was that of a champion contract bridge player and prolific writer on the game. Reese joined the ARP a few months before the war, and was never inducted into the armed forces. He ended up working in the factory of Pedro Juan (a fellow bridge player), which manufactured black-out curtains. When a Ministry of Labour inspector turned up to check on him, a hasty phone-call was needed to get Terence into an office surrounded by ledgers.Reese (1977), p. 27. Reese had some hobbies; even those he pursued with typical commitment. He was always a cricket and chess enthusiast. After World War II, he made a book on greyhound racing; later he became an avid football fan, reputedly supporting Queen's Park Rangers, whose ground was next door to the White City Stadium, a home of greyhound racing. He played various other games for money, especially canasta, poker and backgammon, and wrote books on them. From the late 1930s to the mid-1950s, Reese presented a number of BBC radio and television programmes about bridge.Shireen Mohandes, Bridge, May 2016, \\"On the Air\\", pp. 36-7. He edited the British Bridge World from 1956 to 1962. He married Alwyn Sherrington in 1970. They resided in London and later in Hove, Sussex, where he died of aspirin poisoning at home on 29 January 1996 at the age of 82. An inquest ruled his death accidental.Bird, David (2004). [Reese entry]. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Volume 46. . Page 333.  Career as a player  As a bridge player, Reese won every honour in the game, including the European Championship four times (1948, 1949, 1954, 1963) and the Bermuda Bowl (effectively, the World Team Championship) in 1955‚Äîall as a member of the Great Britain open team. He was World Par champion in 1961 and placed second in both the inaugural World Team Olympiad, 1960, and the inaugural World Open Pairs, 1962. He also represented Britain in the 1965 Bermuda Bowl and in five other European Championships. He won the Gold Cup, the premier British domestic competition, on eight occasions.The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge. Editions 1‚Äì4, New York: Crown, 1964‚Äì1984. Editions 5‚Äì6, Memphis: ACBL, 1994‚Äì2001. Reese last participated in international bridge at the 1976 World Team Olympiad in Monte Carlo, where Great Britain placed third.World Bridge Federation results and participants, 1976. He was Britain's non-playing captain in the 1981 European Team Championships in Birmingham, England,European Bridge League results and participants, 1981. placing second. Thus Great Britain qualified for the 1981 Bermuda Bowl, but the WBF credentials committee rejected Reese as captain, citing \\"writings and opinions expressed by Mr. Reese that were considered not in the best interests of the game\\", in the words of New York Times bridge editor Alan Truscott‚Äîprimarily the \\"sordid picture of top-level bridge\\" presented by Reese and Jeremy Flint in their 1979 novel Trick Thirteen.Truscott, Alan (21 September 1981). \\"Bridge: Ban on Reese Had Roots In His Writings on Game\\".

The New York Times. Retrieved 2014-11-12. Preferring backgammon as an alternative in his later years, Reese played little competitive bridge, owing in part to increasing deafness.Reese (1977), p. 128. However, his career as a bridge writer continued unabated. = The Little Major = The concept for \\"the Little Major was born\\"Reese (1977), p. 112‚Äì16. in late 1962, while Reese was en route to a tournament in the Canary Islands with Boris Schapiro. First with Schapiro and then Jeremy Flint, Reese initially created the Little Major bidding system as a warning of what would happen if the development of artificial bidding systems was allowed to go unchecked. However, under this camouflage, the system was a genuine attempt with interesting features. Ultimately, the system was abandoned when its two-year EBU 'A' license was withdrawn \\"on the grounds that not enough players were playing the system\\". = Opinions of Reese = Reese's long-time partner, Boris Schapiro, put his opinion in a 1951 bridge magazine article: :\\"Terence Reese: brilliant, tenacious and imaginative; any amount of courage, very good bidder, immaculate dummy player and defender, never puts pressure on partner. Concentration first class; difficult to play against.\\"Schapiro, Boris (1951). \\"Knights of the square table\\". Contract Bridge Journal. Reprinted in Hasenson (2004), p. 63. Eleven years later, Schapiro still thought Reese was the best player in the country: :\\"Reese is still the best, and in my opinion by a greater margin than before. His dummy and defence are as immaculate as ever, and the old gentleman has actually polished up his bidding. Believe it or not, he has condescended to play 'fourth suit forcing' and Stayman, and I strongly suspect that by 1973 he will be giving the Baron system a close look.\\"Schapiro, Boris (1962). Contract Bridge Journal. Reprinted in Hasenson (2004), p. 63. Upon Reese's death in 1996, Schapiro wrote: :\\"... Terence was the best player, one of only two geniuses I have known. The other was Lasker, the chess player. Terence was not a slow player but occasionally he went into a trance. I didn't mind and could sit there and wait. I knew that when he eventually played a card it would be the right one.\\"Hasenson (2004), p. 149. Victor Mollo had this to say about Reese in 1967: :Terence Reese is, perhaps, the best bridge player in the world. Cold, aloof, dispassionate, he has many admirers... and a host of enemies. Intelligence of a high order ... the impression of a one-sided but very unusual personality.Mollo, Victor (1967). The Bridge Immortals. London: Faber. Page 85. (US edition, 1968). New York: Hart Publishing. Page 119. Alan Truscott wrote in The New York Times two weeks after Reese's death: :\\"Reese was even more famous as a newspaper columnist, a theorist and a writer. Two of his early books, Reese on Play and The Expert Game, were classics, and are still read by every serious student of bridge.\\"Truscott, Alan (12 February 1996). \\"Bridge\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2014-11-12.  The Buenos Aires affair  In the 1965 Buenos Aires Bermuda Bowl, B. Jay Becker noticed Reese and his partner, Boris Schapiro, holding their cards in unusual ways during bidding, the number of fingers showing indicating length of the heart suit. A number of players and observers, including Dorothy Hayden, New York Times columnist Alan Truscott, John Gerber, British nonplaying captain Ralph Swimer, British Bridge League Chairman Geoffrey Butler, ACBL president emeritus Waldemar von Zedtwitz, and ACBL President Robin McNabb, all watched Reese and Schapiro and were convinced that they were signalling illegally. It was also confirmed that Reese was not using such signals while playing with his other partner, Jeremy Flint. At a hearing held at the tournament site in Buenos Aires, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) judged Reese and Schapiro guilty of cheating, and announced that due to \\"certain irregularities\\", the British team was forfeiting the matches they had already won against North America and Argentina, and that Reese and Shapiro would not be playing in the remaining matches. The British Bridge League (BBL) subsequently convened their own enquiry, chaired by Sir John Foster, barrister and Member of Parliament, and General Lord Bourne. After hearing lasting many months, including a surprise revelation by Swimer that Schapiro had confessed his guilt to him, the \\"Foster Enquiry\\" found insufficient evidence to find Reese and Schapiro guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Without rebutting the \\"direct\\" evidence that grips were correlated with heart count, the report emphasized that there was inconclusive evidence that the players had benefitted from the signals in their bidding or play. In 1967, the BBL asked the WBF to reverse their guilty finding; the WBF responded by unanimously reaffirming their guilty verdict, and later reiterating that they would not accept a British team including Reese and Schapiro for the 1968 Olympiad, which the BBL boycotted in protest. In 1968, a compromise was reached, the WBF maintaining their guilty verdict, but allowing Reese and Schapiro (who had announced his retirement from international bridge after the Buenos Aires Olympiad) to play in future world championships. Subsequently, both Reese Reese, Terence (1966). The Story of an Accusation. London: Heinemann. LCCN 67075048. 244 pages. (US edition, 1967). New York: Simon & Schuster. LCCN 67017872. 246 pages. and Alan TruscottTruscott, Alan (1969). The Great Bridge Scandal. Yarborough Press. published books on the scandal. Reese's book stated: \\"The basis of the charge, as everybody knows, is that Schapiro and I communicated length in hearts to one another by means of illegal signals. If you want to support that charge by reference to the hands played, what you have to show is that a number of illogical, uncharacteristic, and implausible bids or plays were made that can be explained only on the basis that the players had improper knowledge of one another's hands.\\" It then goes on to argue for the logic of the pair's bidding and play on the various hands from the Olympiad. Truscott's book emphasizes the unlikelihood of the observed variations in finger signals being coincidental, or of such a large number of witnesses colluding to fabricate the evidence. It also recounts a number of previous cheating accusations against Reese and Schapiro (including games other than bridge), some by others as early as 1955.. In May 2005, the English journalist David Rex-Taylor, a bridge player and publisher, claimed that Reese had made a confession to him forty years earlier, one that was not to be revealed until 2005 and after he and Schapiro were dead.Alder, Philip.\\"Cheating Scandal From '65 Rears Head Again\\". The New York Times. 20 Jun 2005. The purported confession claimed that Reese and Schapiro were indeed signalling, but only to show that such signaling was possible (and so were not actually paying attention to each other's signals), purportedly as part of a book on cheating (which was abandoned after the scandal broke). Although this explanation could conceivably reconcile the use of finger signals with the absence of evidence from bidding or play, there is no corroborating evidence to support this account. In contrast, Schapiro's widow claims he continued to deny the accusations to his death.\\"The Buenos Aires affair: Card Tricksters\\". The Independent. 11 May 2005.Scandal in Buenos Aires Conclusion by Barnet Shenkin  Career as a bridge author  Reese also had a successful career as a bridge author and journalist, a career that lasted throughout his life. He was one of the most influential and acerbic of bridge writers, with a large output (over ninety titles), including several books which remain in print as classics of bridge play. He was also the long-time bridge correspondent of The Lady, The Observer, the London Evening News and the Evening Standard. He was also a frequent contributor to The Bridge World magazine which gave the following response to criticism of their continuing to publish articles by him after the Buenos Aires affair: Reese contributed to the Acol bidding system originally developed by Maurice Harrison-Gray, Jack Marx and S.J.(\\"Skid\\") Simon in the late 1920s and early 1930sAcol Bridge Club Website. and co- authored the first textbook on it with Ben Cohen in 1938.Cohen, Ben and Terence Reese, The Acol Two Club: with an introduction by S.J. Simon, Leng, Sheffield, 1938. This was the first Acol textbook, its authors wisely disclaiming originality: \\"We do a job of reporting.\\" It had a famous Preface, \\"Attitude of Mind\\" by Skid Simon. -- Second and subsequent editions titled The Acol System of contract bridge. Joiner & Steele, London. -- 2nd ed 1939; 3rd ed 1946, with 13 hands from the Waddington Par Contest; 4th ed 1949, with a selection of hands from the 1949 International Series; 5th ed [1956?], with a selection of hands from the 1955-56 international events and an Introduction by Guy Ramsey. The fourth edition introduced three new chapters on competitive bidding, mistakes to avoid, and two clubs over one no-trump (the Marx convention). Named after the Acol Bridge Club in North London (located on Acol Road at the time), it became the prevailing bidding system in Britain and some other parts of the world. The book and its subsequent editions in 1939, 1946 and 1949 gave unity to what was otherwise a rather free-wheeling bidding system. His later adaptation of Garozzo and Yallouze's book on the Blue Club and his book on the Precision Club were widely used by devotees of strong club systems, and by their opponents as references. The great success of Reese on Play (an outstanding guide to dummy play and defence) was followed by an even more ambitious work. The Expert Game was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\"). Another form of logic can be seen in 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of counting (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely. Reese also had the distinction of creating several new genres of bridge book. The most significant was the 'Over my shoulder' genre, where the reader is taken through the master's thinking as the bidding and play proceeds through the hand. Play Bridge with Reese was the model for several such works. Develop Your Bidding Judgment was another such work. Later, Reese made use of the growing library of hands from international competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. Famous Hands from Famous Matches was the first of these, followed by Famous Bidding Decisions and Famous Play Decisions, all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. What Would _You_ Bid? was the result. Reese also wrote books on poker, casino gambling, canasta and backgammon.

It is also a U.S. National Natural Landmark. It is crossed by both I-75 and U.S. 441 (which has a scenic outlook ramp). It is in the center of the Paynes Prairie Basin. The basin's primary source of drainage is Alachua Sink. During occasional wet periods, the basin will become full. A notable period occurred from 1871 to 1891 when the Alachua Sink was temporarily blocked. During this period, shallow draft steamboats were a frequent sight on Alachua Lake in the center of the prairie. The region was also historically known as the Alachua Savannah. Its drainage has been modified by several canals. Since 1927, Camps Canal has linked the basin to the River Styx which leads to Orange Lake and eventually the Atlantic Ocean through the St. Johns River. That reduced the basins water intake by half. Additional changes to the prairie's environment have been detrimental to its hydrology. In 1970, the state of Florida acquired the land and has been in the process of restoring the environment to a more natural condition ever since. Heavy rains have temporarily restored Alachua Lake on several occasions, most recently in September 2017, when Hurricane Irma dropped several inches of rain and damaged a levee, flooding much of the basin for months. History =Rancho la Ch√∫a= Before 1637, Francisco Men√©ndez M√°rquez the royal treasurer of Spanish Florida established Rancho la Ch√∫a in the vicinity of Paynes Prairie. It spanned and would be, by the late 17th-century, the largest cattle ranch in the colony. It was raided several times by various Native groups and by French buccaneers. It became abandoned by 1706. =Cuscowilla and Paynes Town= The prairie became the stronghold of the Alachua band of the Seminole tribe under chief Ahaya the Cowkeeper by the mid-1700s. The Seminole town of Cuscowilla was located near modern Micanopy, Florida. In 1774 the area, then known as Alachua Savannah, was visited by William Bartram who noted in his book, \\"Bartram's Travels\\", that it was used as grazing ground by the local Seminole. By the 1790s, Cuscowilla had been relocated to a site east of Lake Wauburg and become known as Paynes Town. The town and the surrounding prairie was named for the Cowkeeper's eldest surviving son, Payne. Paynes Town was destroyed by Tennessee Volunteers in 1813. Fort Tarver and Ford Crane were both located in Paynes Prairie during the Second Seminole War. After Indian Removal, the area became inhabited by European Americans, their slaves, and very small number of free people of color. A railroad line was built along the northern edge of the prairie in the late 1800s. In 1868, heavy rains filled the basin, but quickly drained away. About 1871, Alachua Sink was temporarily blocked and the basin became full for several years. From 1871 to 1891 Alachua Lake was receiving enough water that steamboats were able to be used on it. A line ran from Chacala Pond to Sweetwater Branch. About 1889, the water level of Alachua Lake began to slowly drop. During the winter of 1890/1891 the lake was 58 feet deep. Then in late July and August 1891, the water levels of Alachua Lake suddenly dropped. Its banks were littered with dead fish and dead alligators. At one point, the water levels dropped eight feet in the span of ten days and left the lake with only its two main basins with any water. This draining event marooned one of the steamers then plying the lake, and similar events had occurred in 1823 and 1870. =Camp Ranch and the canal system= By the 1920s, most of the prairie had been purchased by Camp Ranch, Inc. In 1927, Camp Ranch, Inc. built a canal system to divert water coming into Alachua Lake in the Paynes Prairie Basin from Newnans Lake to Orange Lake through the River Styx. The diversion of the water meant a loss of 50% of the surface water supply to Paynes Prairie. That same year, the state of Florida built U.S. 441 through the basin. In 1937, Camp Ranch began construction on the Sweetwater Branch Canal. It was designed to channelize the flow from Sweetwater Branch directly into Alachua sink instead of allowing it to settle in Lake Alachua. The subsequent urbanization of Gainesville increased the amount of stormwater directed into Sweetwater Branch and also pollutants. In 1964, the construction of I-75 through the western section of the prairie was completed. =Conservation and restoration= In 1970, the state of Florida acquired the land from Camp Ranch, Inc. It was designated a natural landmark in December 1974. In 1975, the Florida Park Service temporarily restored half of the historic rate of flow of water from Newnans Lake to Paynes Prairie. During the 1970s and 1980s, officials reintroduced several species to Paynes Prairie. As of 2013, Paynes Prairie receives one-third of its water from Newnans Lake, one-third from all other sources, and one-third from direct rainfall. The removal of the canals that same year had restored 7.95 miles of dikes and canals. Due to occasional heavy rains the rate of water from Prairie Creek to the Prairie is eliminated entirely to prevent damage to U.S. 441. In the mids-2010s, the , a 125-acre constructed enhancement wetland, was put in place on the northern section of Paynes Prairie. The project was designed to restore sheetflow to parts of the prairie obstructed by the Sweetwater Branch Canal and to also reduce the TMDL to acceptable levels that the Alachua Sink experiences. The Sweetwater Wetlands Park opened in May 2015. Future plans The status of the highways on low dikes has led to some within Florida's Department of Environmental Protection to recommend their possible replacement with raised roadways on bridges to ameliorate the biological and hydrological impact of the roadways as they currently exist. Replacements of other canals has also been planned. There are also plans to protect and promote various archaeological and historical sites on the prairie.  Environment  Paynes Prairie is part of the Southeastern conifer forests ecoregion. The prairie itself is a large Floridian highlands freshwater marsh, composed of different herbaceous plant communities that vary based on water depth. Wet, forested areas have southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamps of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora). Southern coastal plain blackwater river floodplain forests grow along streams. On drier uplands, southern coastal plain oak domes and hammocks of southern live oak (Quercus virginiana) grow in areas with moderately moist soils, and Florida longleaf pine sandhills grow on drier, sandier soils. Over 270 species of birds can be seen in the park as well as American alligators and small herds of Florida Cracker horses and Florida Cracker cattle, first herded by the Seminole were introduced in 1985. The plains bison were reintroduced to the park from the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in 1975, as part of the park service goal of restoring Florida's natural resources to pre-European settler conditions; they roamed this area until the late 18th century. When bison sightings occur, they usually appear along the Cone's Dike trail. The herd was reduced from thirty- five to seven individuals in the mid-1980s after an outbreak of Brucellosis. In the late 1990s, the herd was again reduced after inbreeding concerns. The buffalo herd reached a peak of 70 animals in 2011. The park began culling excessive animals in 2012, allowing a target population of about 8 to 10 bison to be free to roam the Florida prairie.Gainesville Times, bison articleGainesville Times, bison roundup  Recreational activities  The park contains exhibits and an audio-visual program at the visitor center that explains the area's natural and cultural history. A -high observation tower near the visitor center provides a panoramic view of the preserve. Eight different trails provide opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, and bicycling.

The population at the 2011 Census was 4,123 residents. Old Altona was founded in 1880 by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from the Russian Empire. It is surrounded by the Municipality of Rhineland. Much of the surrounding area is devoted to farming and agriculture- based business. Town of Altona website History Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Russia began settling in Manitoba from 1874 through 1880 after signing a Privilegium with the Canadian government. The settlers initially were located in the Mennonite Reserve (largely now the Rural Municipality of Hanover). This area, east of the Red River and south of the Seine River, became known as the East Reserve when another block of land west of the Red River, known as the West Reserve was granted for Mennonite settlement in 1876, which included the land to become Altona. The first settlement at Altona was made in 1880, by Bergthal Mennonites from the East Reserve nearby. A southern spur of the Canadian Pacific Railway went through the Altona village area in 1882. A separate town-site, also named Altona, had its start in the 1895 when the Canadian Pacific Railroad was extended to that point, with the village area later known as Old Altona. While Altona had a population large enough to support incorporation by the late 1920s, it took until 1946 for the community to be incorporated as a village. Its population at that time was 1065 residents. In 1956, population growth to 1698 residents prompted the village council to apply to the provincial government to change the status to town. This change became official on 24 October 1956. Geography =Climate= Demographics The 2011 Canadian Census reported that Altona had a population of 4,088, a 10.2 per cent increase since 2006.Statistics Canada. 2011 Census Profile for Altona Retrieved 5 April 2015 Not surprisingly given the town's Mennonite founders, of 3,990 respondents, 1,415 listed their mother tongue as German, though this may also include Plautdietsch. The median age of the population reported was 39.2 years. Economy Altona was the site of the Rhineland Consumers Co-operative (founded 1931 ), the Altona Co-op Service (founded 1937), the Altona Credit Union (founded 1939) and Co-op Vegetable Oils (CVO) (founded 1943). These co-operative enterprises were a highly effective local response to the devastating impact of the Great Depression on local farmers' incomes. Jake (J.J.) Siemens played an important role in their development, and the growth of the co-operative movement in southern Manitoba. Bunge Limited now operates the oil-seed crushing plant in Altona, after buying the assets from Canamera Foods. Altona is also home to Friesens Corporation, which started off as a small confectionery store opened by David W. Friesen in 1907 and now employs hundreds of people. It is the primary printer of yearbooks in North America, as well as printing in commercial consumer books, specializing in full colour art and educational books. The town is also the headquarters for Golden West Broadcasting. The first Mennonite Central Committee self-help centre (now Gift and Thrift Store) in Canada was founded in Altona in 1972. Staffed by volunteers, MCC Thrift stores now contribute about $4M annually to MCC projects. The store has been expanded numerous times, and is still completely volunteer-run. The proceeds raised all go to MCC charitable projects. Arts and Culture The Red River Valley's climate allows Manitoba to be Canada's largest producer of sunflowers. Altona, Manitoba is known as \\"The Sunflower Capital of Canada\\", and is host to the annual Sunflower Festival, which began in 1965. The Sunflower Festival has a Sunflower festival pageant where they crown a queen every year, who wins a trip to Australia. The festival also includes a small midway, quilt show, baseball tournament, stage show, and street dance to name a few. In 2008, the Town of Altona opened an Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden, displaying many different styles of artwork. Altona's sister city is Emerald, Queensland, Australia. Every year a Sunflower Festival is held in which a young woman in the community is crowned the Sunflower Queen and gets a flight to Emerald for free to participate in the Sunflower Festival held there. Attractions The giant replica of Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh The community is home to the largest replica of a famous painting by Vincent van Gogh. It was named 'The largest painting on an easel by The Guinness Book of World Records in 1998. It was the first of three works in the Big Easel Project by local artist Cameron Cross, based on the painting Sunflowers. The base (easel) stands at 76'6\\" and the canvas was made by laminating together 24 sheets of 3/4\\" plywood and splattering it with 17 gallons of paint to create the picture. The Trans Canada Trail goes through Altona, heading south to Gretna and west to Rosengart through Buffalo Creek Nature Park. Oakview Golf & Country Club is located south of Altona. Infrastructure Altona Municipal Airport is about 2.8 km southeast of the town. Manitoba Highway 30 is the main north-south route. It begins in Gretna, and passes on the east border of Altona to Rosenfeld. Manitoba Provincial Road 201 is the main east-west route. In the late 1990s the town, in partnership with various businesses and volunteers, embarked on an ambitious plan to improve recreation facilities. In 2000, the Altona Aquatic Centre opened to rave reviews, a trails system was started, and in 2003 the Millennium Exhibition Centre opened. This 75,000 square-foot facility features an ice arena, curling arena, banquet hall, meeting rooms, running track, concessions, kitchens and community spaces. Since then, other recreation facilities have been added such as a triples tennis court, a large playground, and most recently in 2013 a $250,000 skate park, and a second full size baseball diamond set to open in 2014 - to be known as Access Field. Education Altona is the located in, and home to the head office of, the Border Land School District. W.C. Miller Collegiate is the high school in the town. Other schools within Altona are √âcole Elmwood School (grades K-3), √âcole West Park School (grades 4-6), and √âcole Parkside School (grades 7-8). Media The town was serviced by the Red River Valley Echo newspaper, part of the Postmedia Network. It ceased operation mid 2020.

He was loyal to Ahl al-Bayt in spite of his absence at the Battle of Karbala. He is reported to have said: ‚ÄùThanks to God Almighty, I could not support al-Husayn ibn Ali at Karbala, but my two sons (‚ÄôAwn and Muhammad) did. According to Richard Francis Burton he is widely recognized as the most sympathetic amongst Arabs. His grave is situated near Aqeel ibn Abi Talib and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith (the grandson of Abd al- Muttalib) in Janatual Baqi) The Grave of ‚ÄôAbdullah bin Ja‚Äôfar at-Tayyar in Al- Baqi Early life He was the son of Ja'far ibn Abu Talib and Asma bint Umais. They had emigrated to Abyssinia in 616, and Abdullah and his two brothers were born there.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). The Women of Madina. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. Abdullah was the first of Muslims to be born in the land of Abyssinia After birth of Abdullah in Abyssinia (Habesha Presently Ethiopia), king of the Kingdom of Aksum ( Al-Najashi) was blessed with a son too. He immediately asked the parents of Abdullah Ibn Jaffar about the name of their child. Upon knowing the name of Jaffar family, King of Abyssinia also chose the name ‚ÄúAbdullah‚Äù for his first son. It is also stated that Asma bint Umays was the nursing mother of son of Abyssinian King. The younger brother of Abdullah appears to be the first child in the Muslim history who was named Muhammad after the Prophet of Islam. The family returned to Arabia in 628 and settled in Medina. =Muhammad's Supplication & instruction= In addition to Ibn Hajar' reference, it is said that after 3 days of Jafar‚Äôs death Muhammad went to house of Asma and called for children of Jafar. He then said about each of them ‚ÄúAs for Muhammad, he resemble our uncle Abi Talib. As for Abdullah, he resembles me in terms of both my appearance and character. Afterward, Muhammad took the right hand of Abdullah and said ‚ÄúO Allah, provide a successor for Jafar in his family, and bless Abdullah in his business, and repeated this appeal to Al-mighty thrice. Muhammad instructed the sons of Abi Talib, namely Jafar, Aqeel and Ali that they should arrange marriages of their children with their cousins. Marriage and Family Life Ali had particularly wished that his daughters should marry Ja'far's sons. When Abdullah asked for Zainab's hand, Ali accepted it. Abdullah and Zainab had five children. *Ali ibn Abdullah. *Awn ibn Abdullah. *Abbas ibn Abdullah. *Muhammad ibn Abdullah. *Umm Kulthum bint Abdullah. According to Shaikh Muhammad Abbas Qummi, he had 20 sons from different wives, including 5 children from Zainab Binte Ali. Daira-e-Maarif Islamia (Circle of Islamic Knowledge) of University of Punjab (pages 568-70, Vol.X) describes that Zainabi is a progeny of Abdullah‚Äôs son Ali through Zainab binte Ali Abdullah Bin Jaffar-e-Tayyar was one of the richest people in Madina and a famous philanthropist who was called as ‚ÄúBahrul Joud‚Äù which means an ocean of charity. When Ali became the Caliph in 656 and moved from Medina to Kufa, Zainab and Abdullah joined him. =His wife‚Äôs journey with Hussain Ibn Ali= It is related that Zainab already forecast the journey (journey to Karbala) before her marriage and permission for accompanying with her brother was obtained during marriage negotiations. With regard to Absent of Abdullah in battle of Karbala, it is said it was due to his poor eye sighting consequently he was unable to bear the rigidities of journey and war. Knowing Hussain‚Äôs journey to Kufa, Zainab, the wife of Abdullah ibn Jaffar begged her husband‚Äôs permission to accompany her brother. Realizing anxiousness of her husband she stated that: Abdullah then granted his permission and sent their two sons for the destined journey. Abdullah was concurrently married to Layla bint Masud. With reference to books ‚ÄòNasab e Quraish Page-83‚Äô and ‚ÄòJameerath ul Nasab by Ibn Hazm page 62‚Äô it is described that Layla Binte Masood bin Khalid was ‚ÄúZoja-e-Sani (second wife)‚Äù through this marriage he had two daughters (Umme Muhammad and Umme Abhiha) and four sons (Yahya, Haroon, Suleh & Musa). Career Battles:With regard to his presence in the Battle of Camel, it is indicated that at the end of Battle, while entrusting the return of Aisha to Medina under security of her brother Muhammad ibn Abi Bakar, Ali ordered for payment of 12,000 Dirhams to Aisha. Abdullah thinking that the amount was too little, brought out a larger sum for Aisha. According to Ahmad ibn A'tham in battle of Siffin he was commanding the infantry in the army of Ali ibn Abi Talib together with his cousin Muslim ibn Aqeel, Muhammad ibn Al-Hanafiyyah and step brother Muhammad bin Abi Bakar. Politics:He was a staunch supporter of his uncle Ali in the civil war. He maintained a reputation for liberality and patronage in Medina, earning him the nickname ‚Äúthe Ocean of Generosity‚Äù. online ref: After killing of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Abdullah bin Jaffar together with his cousins Hassan and Hussain participated in washing the body and dressed him for burial in three robes without a Kurta (a long shirt). In addition to some spy reporting to Ali Ibn Abi Talib that Qays bin Sad bin Ubadah, his governor at Egypt had given allegiance to Muawiya, he received his letter which was written in perspective of affairs emerged on account of a conspiracy caused by opponent of Ali. Ali called his sons and Abdallah bin Ja'far and consulted the matter. Upon advice of Abdullah, Ali wrote a letter ordering Qays bin Sad to seek the people to give their allegiance as the Muslims have done (after the 3rd Caliph). But, if they do not, then fight them. The governor of Egypt against this communication wrote a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib. Then Abdullah Bin Jaffar requested his father in law to replace Qays bin Sad bin Ubadah with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as governor of Egypt and pleaded that if he really has gone over to Mu\`awiyah, he will refuse to give up Egypt. However, according to Tabari it was a poor advice consequent to meeting of Qays bin Sad with Ali during the period of killing of Muhammad bin Abi Bakar. Once a Chief of Iraqi village asked Abdullah Bin Jafar to recommend his case before Caliph Ali for accomplishment. He did so and matter of that chief was satisfied by Ali Ibn Abi Talib. As a gratification the chief sent 40,000 Darhims through some people to Abdullah, who refused the money saying that we do not sell our good deeds. His vision for Hussain Knowing death of his two sons in the battle of Karbala, people were offering condolences to Abdullah, one of his Mawili (Abu al-Lislas [a companion]) said that ‚Äúthis is what we have met and what has come upon us through Hussain Ibn Ali‚Äù on this statement he struck him with his sandal and told that I am pleased that my two sons killed with my brother and cousin. By God! If I had been present with him, I would have preferred not to leave him in order that I would be killed with him. He then seeking attention of people consoling him, said that ‚ÄúPraise be to God, Who has made life hard, console Hussain Ibn Ali with my own hands, my two sons consoled him. =Letter to Hussain= According to Ibn Khaldun in chapter 2 volume II title ‚ÄúYazid-I‚Äù from 60 to 64 AH, it is described that Abdullah sent a letter through his sons Awn & Muhammad, to Hussain, requesting that ‚Äúfor God sake come back. It is my advice to you in anxiety that you would be killed and Ahle-Bayt destroyed. As a result, earth‚Äôs light will come to an end, there would be no leader for Muslims. Please do not hurry in journey, I would be reaching there after this letter.\\" Later he went to Amr bin Said who was Yazid's governor of Mecca and asked him to write a letter to Hussain offering him a guarantee of harmless behavior assuring him kindness and open-handedness. \\"Show trust to him in your letter and request him to return.\\" This letter was replied by Hussain too.

It is the third tale in the audiobook collection Blood and Smoke, released in 1999. In 2002, \\"1408\\" was collected in written form as the 12th story in King's collection Everything's Eventual. In the introduction to the story, King says that \\"1408\\" is his version of what he calls the \\"Ghostly Room at the Inn\\", his term for the theme of haunted hotel or motel rooms in horror fiction. He originally wrote the first few pages as part of an appendix for his non-fiction book, On Writing (2000), to be used as an example of how a story changes from one draft document to the next. King also noted how the numbers of the title add up to the supposedly unlucky number 13. Plot summary Mike Enslin is a writer of non-fiction works based on the theme of haunted places: Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Houses, Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Graveyards, and Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Castles. They prove to be best-sellers, but Enslin feels some guilt at their success, privately acknowledging that he does not believe in the paranormal and supernatural elements he investigates. Arriving at the Dolphin Hotel on 61st Street in New York City, Enslin is intent on spending the night in the hotel's infamous Room 1408 as part of his research for his next book, Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Hotel Rooms. He is met by the hotel's manager, Mr. Olin, who fills him in on the room's morbid history ‚Äì 1408 has been responsible for 42 deaths, at least 12 of them suicides, over a span of 68 years. While remarking he does not believe there are ghosts in 1408, Olin insists there is \\"something\\" that resides inside, causing terrible things to happen to anyone who stays within its walls for anything but the briefest periods of time. As such, he has striven to keep the room vacant during his tenure as manager, a period of nearly 20 years. Olin also reveals that, due to the superstitious practice of never recognizing the 13th floor (the room is listed as being on the 14th), it is a room cursed by existing on the 13th floor, the room numbers adding up to 13 making it all the worse. Enslin is secretly affected by Olin's remarks and evidence, but his determination to not appear superstitious and follow through with his research wins out. He demands the right to stay in the room by threatening legal action against the hotel. Olin pleads with Enslin to reconsider, believing that a skeptic would be highly susceptible to the room's powers. At Enslin's continued insistence, Olin reluctantly leads him to 1408, unwilling to accompany him farther than the elevator landing on the 14th floor. Enslin's problems with Room 1408 begin before he even sets foot through the door; the door itself initially appears to be canted to the left. After looking away and back, the door appears perfectly straight. Then, after looking a third time, it appears to be crooked again, except now to the right. Chalking the experience up to Olin's attempt to manipulate him, he girds himself and enters the room. Enslin spends 70 minutes in Room 1408, dictating his experience into a handheld tape recorder. Almost immediately, his train of thought takes unwelcome and chaotic turns ‚Äî he compares it to being \\"stoned on bad, cheap dope\\" ‚Äî and he experiences bizarre visual hallucinations. A breakfast menu on the night-stand changes languages to French, then Russian, then Italian, then a woodcut of a wolf eating a screaming boy's leg. The patterns on the wallpaper seems to shift and warp, and the room's pictures transform into grotesque parodies. Enslin feels his feet sink into the carpet like quicksand, and he hears a nightmarish voice on the room's phone chanting terrifying phrases: \\"This is nine! Nine! We have killed your friends! Every friend is now dead! This is six! Six!\\" The room itself begins to melt, the walls and ceiling warping and bowing inward. Enslin senses a dangerous, otherworldly presence coming for him. In desperation, he sets his \\"lucky\\" Hawaiian shirt on fire while wearing it, breaking the room's spell long enough for him to escape. Stumbling out into the hall, another hotel guest douses him with ice. When the other guest looks inside the room and is tempted to enter, Enslin warns him not to, claiming the room is \\"haunted\\". The door slams shut. After his ordeal, Enslin gives up writing altogether. He has acquired various physical and psychological problems stemming from his brief stay in the room. He notes to himself (as Olin expressed earlier) that there are no ghosts in 1408, because ghosts were once merely humans, while the entity he encountered was horrifically inhuman. In the end, Enslin sleeps with his lights on, has removed all his house's phones, and always draws the curtains before dark; he cannot stand the shade of yellow-orange at sunset that reminds him of the light inside Room 1408.

She currently carries the markings of PS888 of 81 Squadron based at Seletar, Singapore, during the Malayan Emergency which conducted the last operational RAF Spitfire sortie on 1 April 1954, photographing communist guerrilla hideouts over an area of jungle in Johore. The ground crew painted the inscription \\"The Last!\\" on PS 915's left engine cowling. One Mark XIX Spitfire, PS853, was sold in 1994 to defray the costs of rebuilding Hurricane LF363 after her crash-landing on the runway at RAF Wittering due to engine failure in 1991. The BBMF pilot escaped with a broken ankle and minor bruises, whilst LF363 was engulfed and devastated by the resulting fire. Spitfire Mark XVI TE311, built as a low-back with clipped wings and powered with a Packard Merlin engine, was acquired in 2002 and initially allocated for spares, but officially added to the BBMF collection in 2007. TE311 was made airworthy in the later stages of the 2012 display season. TE311 is currently painted as the personal aircraft of Gp Capt Aleksander Gabszewicz, the Officer Commanding No. 131 (Polish) Wing. =Hurricanes= Hurricane MkIIC LF363 in 2009 There are two Hurricanes. LF363 is a Mk IIc and the last Hurricane to have entered service with the RAF. She appeared in the films Angels One Five, Reach for the Sky, The Battle of Britain, and a TV series The War in the Air. PZ865, is a Mk IIc built six months after LF363; she is the last Hurricane ever to have been built. She once wore the inscription \\"The last of the Many\\" on her port and starboard sides - the original fabric with this inscription is now located in the BBMF Headquarters at RAF Coningsby. =Lancaster= Lancaster PA474 in 2011 The Lancaster bomber - PA474, acquired by the BBMF in 1973, is one of only two surviving airworthy examples of the type; the other is in Canada. She was built in mid-1945 and assigned to reconnaissance duties after appearing too late to take part in the bombing of Japan. After various duties, she was adopted by the Air Historical Branch for display work. She appeared in two films: Operation Crossbow and The Guns of Navarone. Having been flown for much of her service with the BBMF as the \\"City of Lincoln\\", PA474 previously wore the markings of the \\"Phantom of the Ruhr\\", a Lancaster that flew 121 sorties (a so-called \\"ton-up\\" Lancaster). Originally assigned to 100 Squadron in June 1943, the original \\"Phantom\\" was transferred to 101 Squadron in November that year and finished the war as part of 550 Squadron at Ludford Magna. The Lancaster currently carries the markings of AR-L 'Leader', which served with No 460 Squadron (RAAF). PA474 displays the markings of bombs for operations over Germany, ice-cream cones for operations over Italy and poppies when she releases poppies during exhibition flights. During the 2008 RAF Waddington Air Day, PA474 was flown in formation with the recently restored Avro Vulcan XH558 in an historic display of two Avro \\"heavy metal\\" classics. =Dakota= Dakota ZA947 taking off in 2009 The Dakota, ZA947, built at Long Beach, California in March 1942, was issued to the US Army Air Forces and later transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force where she served until 1971. The aircraft was purchased by the Royal Aircraft Establishment before being issued to the BBMF in March 1993. She is equipped with authentic period 'para seats' and is used in commemorative parachute drops. The Dakota did serve solely as a support aircraft for the flight and as a multi-engine tail-wheel trainer for the Lancaster; but recently she has also acted as a display aircraft in her own right. ZA947 is becoming increasingly popular with the public and 2013 saw the aircraft making many appearances. =Chipmunks= DHC-1 Chipmunk T10 WG486 in 2010 The two Chipmunks (WG486 and WK518), are the last in RAF service, but are not intended for display use; rather, they serve to give pilots experience in flying aircraft with a tailwheel landing gear, a design that has now vanished from the modern RAF fleet. Chipmunk WG486 flew reconnaissance missions over East Germany, as part of the RAF Gatow Station Flight, in co-operation with the British Commander-in-Chief's Mission to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, commonly known as BRIXMIS. =Flypasts= Two Hawker Hurricanes and five Supermarine Spitfires at Duxford Airshow in 2007 The flight also regularly takes part in combined flypasts with other recognisable British aircraft, such as the Red Arrows. It appeared on occasion with Concorde before that aircraft's withdrawal from service in October 2003. For much of the 2014 display season the flight was joined by Canadian built Lancaster B Mk X FM213. This aircraft is owned and operated by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum and made the 3,000-mile trip to the UK, via Goose Bay and Keflavik arriving at RAF Coningsby on 9 August. FM213 (C-GVRA) is dedicated to the memory of P/O Andrew Mynarski VC and is referred to as the \\"Mynarski Memorial Lancaster\\". It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 ‚Äì VR-A, which flew with RCAF No. 419 (Moose) Squadron, and is affectionately known as Vera. She displayed with PA474 in the first Lancaster two-aircraft formation for 50 years, with both Lancasters visiting a large number of air shows and events before Vera's departure back to Canada in mid-September. History of the flight =Biggin Hill= In the years following World War II it became traditional for a Spitfire and Hurricane to lead the Victory Day flypast over London. From that event there grew the idea to form a historic collection of flyable aircraft, initially to commemorate the RAF's major battle honour, the Battle of Britain, and latterly with broadened scope, to commemorate the RAF's involvement in all the campaigns of World War II. Thus in 1957 the Historic Aircraft Flight was formed at RAF Biggin Hill with one Hurricane (LF363) and three Mk XIX Spitfires (PM631, PS853 and PS915), in what, even then, had become a predominantly jet-powered air force. There is evidence that at least one of the Spifires sometimes flew with a single Hawker Hunter F5 of 41 Sqn (the last operational squadron to operate from RAF Biggin Hill) which co-resided with the Spitfires and Hurricane at that time. The two aircraft together were referred to in an official Biggin Hill \\"At Home\\" Day Display programme as the 'Battle of Britain Flight'. =Coltishall= Originally the RAF Historic Aircraft Flight, with a small group of Spitfires and Hurricanes operating from RAF Coltishall from 1963, the group became the \\"Battle of Britain Memorial Flight\\" in 1973, with the acquisition of the Lancaster. =Coningsby= BBMF moved to its present home at RAF Coningsby in 1976, since then it has acquired several more aircraft including, the first Chipmunk acquired in 1983, a Dakota was originally acquired in 1995, as a more reliable multi-engine trainer than the De Havilland Devon, that was nicknamed the 'Devon State Two', due to its tendency to return to the ground on an emergency state two; but has since taken a fuller role in BBMFs line up. The Spitfires and Hurricanes in the flight have varied over the years, as new aircraft are acquired and older ones passed to museums or used for parts. =Past and current BBMF homes= Over the years the BBMF have called many RAF bases \\"home\\". These include: Biggin Hill July 1957‚ÄìMarch 1958, North Weald March‚ÄìMay 1958, Martlesham Heath May 1958‚ÄìNovember 1961, Horsham St Faith November 1961‚ÄìApril 1963, Coltishall April 1963‚ÄìMarch 1976 and RAF Coningsby since March 1976. =Service history of the aircraft= Aircraft currently in the flight have served with the RAF, the United States Army Air Forces, and the Royal Canadian Air Force, as well as having been privately owned; whilst in the RAF, they were flown by Czechoslovakian, Polish, South African, American and Canadian pilots. Some were sold for scrapping and later saved, whilst at least one has been on operational service with the RAF for almost fifty years. Visitor Centre The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Visitor Centre is located at RAF Coningsby in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. A partnership between the Royal Air Force and Lincolnshire County Council, the centre allows visitors an up-close guided tour of the aircraft when not in use, as well as exhibits about the aircraft and other temporary exhibits.

A football match at the Padang set against the Singapore skyline Old Supreme Court Building with the Padang, the New Supreme Court Building shown in the background The Padang (Malay for 'field') is an open playing field located within the Downtown Core of the Central Area in Singapore. It includes the Padang Cricket Ground. The Padang is surrounded by several important landmarks, which include Saint Andrew's Cathedral, City Hall, the Old Supreme Court Building and the City Hall MRT station. Due to its prime location and historical significance, it has been used as a venue for a variety of events, including the National Day Parades some years due to the first ever National Day Parade being held there in 1966, the recently-held Singapore's Golden Jubilee Year in 2015, and later in 2019 honouring the bicentennial anniversary since the founding of modern Singapore in 1819. Since 1995, it has been planned that the NDP would be held there for every five years, the main venue for that major event is at The Float @ Marina Bay (previously the Former National Stadium). On 4 November 2018, Padang hosted the live finals of the Chinese-Mandopop singing reality competition SPOP Sing!. On 3 August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that the Padang will be gazetted as a National Monument along with the Anderson Bridge, Cavenagh Bridge and the Elgin Bridge (collectively known as the Singapore River Bridges), which were gazetted on 15 October that year. History Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown CoreIn June 1819, modern founder of Singapore, Thomas Stamford Raffles instructed the first Resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, to reserve the whole space within the Old Lines and the Singapore River (i.e. the northern bank) for public purposes. However, Farquhar found it expedient to allow European merchants to encroach the reserved space as this appeared to be the only suitable site for mercantile firms and godowns, since the southern bank was then too swampy. Farquhar also built a temporary home with an attap roof and kajang walls on the current Singapore Cricket Club site, on the edge which came to be known as Raffles Plain. When Raffles returned to the island in October 1822, Raffles disapproved of the encroaching by mercantile interests of land he had set aside for public use. Raffles immediately countermanded Farquhar's permits, put a stay on all buildings in the area and appointed a committee with strict and explicit instructions on how he wanted the town of Singapore to be planned. As the Esplanade plan had been broken, it was necessary to designate a new site for the town's public buildings. The area chosen was the Padang Besar or simply the Padang, as it is known today. During the 1820s, there were four houses that faced the Padang, what is now the Old Supreme Court Building were two houses built in 1823 houses of Edward Boustead, and the site of the City Hall formerly the houses of Resident Councillor Thomas Church and William Montgomerie who was Residency Surgeon. In 1845, Gaston Dutronquoy moved into the Boustead houses and converted into his second London Hotel. The place became Hotel de l'Esperance and later Hotel de l'Europe and was demolished in the year 1900. The Grand Hotel de l'Europe was built in 1905 and demolished in 1935 due to financial problems. The hotel made way for the Old Supreme Court Building which was the last Classical architecture building built in Singapore. The statue of Stamford Raffles was unveiled at the plain on 27 June 1877, but it was moved to Victoria Memorial Hall (now Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall) on 6 December 1919. In the past, Padang was referred as The Plain, Cantonment Plain, Raffles Plain or the Esplanade. In modern times, Esplanade refers to the cultural centre known as Esplanade ‚Äì Theatres on the Bay and before that the Esplanade Park. Today, the Padang is a field located between two clubs in front of City Hall. After Raffles' founding of Singapore, this was where the Sepoy Cantonment was first located (hence the name Cantonment Plain), before the sepoys were shifted to Cantonment Road/Sepoy Lines area. Around 1890, the Esplanade was widened by reclaiming land, and constructed a road known as New Esplanade Road (now Connaught Drive). In 1907, the area became known as the Padang and the roads in that area were renamed. Esplanade Road was renamed St. Andrew's Road and New Esplanade Road was known as Connaught Drive. Before reclamation, the sea shore was where Connaught Drive is currently located. Near the current Singapore Recreation Club, was a Saluting Battery mounted on a knoll, which was known in the early days as a Scandal Point. The paintings of the Esplanade by J. T. Thomson in 1847 and 1851 were done at this point. The Padang was threatened to be used for development several times but it was abandoned due to public outcry. Surprisingly, the administration sector of the Padang area began to take shape only in the late 1920s, replacing houses built by G.D. Coleman. The Grand Hotel de l'Europe was demolished and made way for the courthouse in 1936. Today, the Padang is used for many events such as the National Day Parade. The Padang was where the victory parade of the Japanese surrendering Singapore back to the British, and the surrender forces by Lord Louis Mountbatten ending World War II in Singapore. The Padang is used for sports such as soccer, cricket and rugby. Cricket The Padang became a major recreational area when two clubs, the Singapore Cricket Club in 1870 and the Singapore Recreation Club in 1883 were established at both ends of the field. It was used for exercising horses in the 1920s and became the scene for the New Year sporting activities.

Murray agreed to supply half of the capital, with Disraeli and John Diston Powles, a City speculator, each contributing one-quarter. Disraeli travelled to Chiefswood (near Melrose) to persuade John Gibson Lockhart (Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law) to edit the paper; Lockhart declined, but agreed to serve as editor of Murray's Quarterly Review and consult on the management of the paper.

An assignment editor often fields calls from the public, who give news tips, or information about a possible story or event to be covered. Sometimes, these calls may: * Alert editors about a disaster ‚Äì perhaps something as minor as a car accident or as major as a commercial plane crash with mass casualties. * Be someone wishing to make a complaint about corporate or governmental practices, or have information or an opinion about a major decision that a local or state government is making. * Be something as minor as a child building the world's largest sand castle or a budding entrepreneur wanting to promote his/her product. Other times, the news tip may come in the form of a news release, which may either promote an event, meeting, etc.; or alert editors and reporters about an upcoming news conference. Sometimes, assignment editors must sift through hundreds of news releases each day. In many cases, possibly dependent on the market, assignment editors use police scanners, listening to traffic between 911 dispatchers and police officers in the field. Whatever the case, it is the assignment editor's job to determine what news tips and news releases are the most newsworthy, and then decide which reporter to assign a story to. Those assignments are often determined based on the reporter's experience, skills and his/her beat (e.g., police, courts, schools, city hall, county, etc.). If a major story develops ‚Äì such as a disaster or economic development ‚Äì an assignment editor may enlist several reporters (in addition to whoever usually covers that beat) to cover various angles of a story. For instance, if the story is about a plant closing, one reporter may be asked to do the main story about the closing, while other reporters may be asked to do stories on such things as employee reaction, reaction from business and community leaders, a history of the plant (and other plant closings, if appropriate), etc. Required background An assignment editor often has a minimum of one year of experience working for a particular news organization and a number of years of experience working in journalism, usually as line or copy editor, or even a staff writer. An assignment editor is expected to be well versed in journalistic standards and ethics, and have good knowledge of the community in which he/she works and lives. The position is that of a commissioning editor and its responsibilities usually entail the day to day management of staff writers, beat reporters and correspondents, procuring original content from freelance writers, and managing the daily \\"budget meeting\\". Sometimes, it may be a journalist's first job as a senior editor in the newsroom, working with other editorial sections ‚Äì such as copy, opinion, magazine, managing and chief editors ‚Äì alongside the breaking news desk. As more news outlets move to a digital first model, the role has changed substantially, with the emphasis shifting from page planning to commissioning time sensitive pieces that fit a more rapid news cycle. At many smaller daily and weekly newspapers, the role of assignment editor is often combined with an editor's other duties (e.g., an assistant editor who also lays out the pages also may be asked to assign stories to reporters).

John Bayton, George Morgan, and George Croghan, deputy superintendent of Indian affairs, joined in a partnership on the Ohio country and Indian Trade after 1763.Marshall: Bailey, Kenneth P., 'The Ohio Company Papers 1753-1817 (Memorandum for Mr. Trent), Arcata, Cal., 1947, pp.184-5 Though the various colonies laid claim to parts of it after the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Paris gave control of the entire Ohio region to Great Britain of Wharton and their business operation. During the American Revolution, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from Delaware. Early life and family Born in Philadelphia, Wharton was the son of Joseph Wharton, a successful merchant. He was a first cousin to Thomas Wharton, Jr., who was the revolutionary President of Pennsylvania. Though Samuel later made his home in Dover, he always maintained close business connections with the city, where he was a partner in the mercantile firm of Baynton, Wharton and Morgan. He married Sarah Lewis of New Castle in 1754. They would have four children that survived infancy. He was elected to the American Society as a member in 1768.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols.

Ohio Valley trade This map shows the Indiana grant awarded to Wharton and his \\"suffering traders.\\" The land was later included in the Grand Ohio Company's proposed Vandalia colony. In 1768 Wharton attended the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. There Wharton represented a group of merchants, known as the \\"suffering traders\\", who had had trade goods destroyed during the French and Indian War and Pontiac's Rebellion (Marshall 1965:717). As compensation for their losses, the Iroquois granted the \\"suffering traders\\" a tract of land making up about a fourth of modern West Virginia.Marshall: Lewis, G. E., The Indiana Company, 1763-1798' , Glendale, Cal., 1941, pp. 297-305 This land, known as Indiana‚Äîunrelated to the later state of the same name-would cause him nothing but trouble for the next twenty years. Political career When the Revolutionary War broke out, Wharton was in London working to secure the crown's approval for the land grant. When some of his letters to rebels were made public, he was forced to flee to France. He was finally able to return to America in 1780, and took an oath of allegiance to the American cause on February 9, 1781. In 1782 and 1783 Wharton was a delegate to the Continental Congress. Many of his efforts there seem to have been quiet negotiations aimed at gaining recognition for his western land holdings. These did not avail, and he returned to Delaware. The entire claim came to naught when the Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787. Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware ceded all western claims, and his tract was confirmed as part of Virginia. Wharton served two years as a state court judge in Delaware before retiring to a country estate just outside Philadelphia, where he died in March 1800.

Regarded as one of the premier workers of his era, O'Connor held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship and NWA World Heavyweight Championship simultaneously, the latter of which he held for approximately two years. He was also the inaugural AWA World Heavyweight Champion. He is an overall two-time world champion.  Early life  Patrick John O'Connor was born on 22 August 1924 in Raetihi, New Zealand, to parents John Frederick and Isabella. While he attended high school at Feilding Agricultural High School, he also helped tend to the sheep and cattle on his parents' farm. He later attended Massey Agricultural College, and later served for six months in the New Zealand Royal Air Force in 1945.  Amateur wrestling career  Before entering the world of professional wrestling, O'Connor was an amateur wrestler. He trained under Dave Sparrow, and later Don Anderson, while working as a blacksmith to pay the bills. After a tournament in 1947, he joined the Wellington wrestling team and trained under Anton Koolmann. In 1948, he represented New Zealand in the Pan American games. O'Connor won the New Zealand Heavyweight Championship in amateur wrestling in both 1949 and 1950. The 1949 win earned him entry into the 1950 British Empire Games. At the Empire Games, O'Connor, once again representing New Zealand, won a silver medal winner in the (freestyle) heavyweight division. He later trained to be a professional wrestler under Len Levy.  Professional wrestling career  = National Wrestling Alliance = NWA World Heavyweight Champion On 19 March 1955, O'Connor won the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version) with tag team partner Roy McClarity, and held the title until February 1956. Later in the year, he worked for Maple Leaf Wrestling. In March, he won the NWA British Empire Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version), but lost it on 2 May 1957 to Gene Kiniski. That same month, O'Connor and Whipper Billy Watson won the NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship, but lost it to Gene Kiniski and Fritz Von Erich on 31 October of that year. O'Connor held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from 1959 to 1961. He first won the title on 9 January 1959 from Dick Hutton, who had held the title for thirteen months. O'Connor's reign was recognized by both the National Wrestling Alliance and the National Wrestling Association. The title change was part of the rivalry between bookers Sam Muchnick and Fred Kohler, the latter of whom did not want to waste any money announcing O'Connor as the new champion. Kohler also wanted O'Connor to pay him $10,000 to wrestle at shows in Chicago, while being paid less than champions usually earned. O'Connor was so angry at the suggestion that he walked out of their meeting and later told Muchnick not to book him for any events in Chicago. The men later worked out a deal of sorts, and beginning on 19 February 1960, O'Connor wrestled in Chicago against Bruno Sammartino and Johnny Valentine, among others. On 29 July at one of Fred Kohler's events, O'Connor defeated Yukon Eric at an event with an attendance of 30,275. During this time, television also became a factor in the burgeoning market for professional wrestling, and as a result, the demand to trade wrestlers, including O'Connor, throughout the territories, was eased due to Vincent McMahon's Capitol Wrestling. In December, he worked for McMahon in the Northeast. In March 1961, he was suspended for sixteen days when he missed a match in New York. On 30 June 1961, O'Connor dropped the title to Buddy Rogers in front of 38,622 fans at Comiskey Park, a North American professional wrestling attendance record that lasted until Toronto's The Big Event in 1986. The ticket revenue of $148,000 was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years. The match, a two out of three falls match, was billed as the \\"Match of the Century\\". During the match, both men had gained a pinfall, when O'Connor missed a dropkick and suffered a legit groin injury on the ropes, after which Rogers pinned him to win the match. = American Wrestling Association = In May 1960, while still the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the American Wrestling Association (AWA) named O'Connor as the first holder of the AWA World Heavyweight Championship when they seceded from the NWA. Therefore, he held both the AWA and NWA World Heavyweight Championships simultaneously. However, he never defended the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, and was stripped of it in August, after ninety days, when Verne Gagne was recognized as the new champion. On 10 November 1967, the team of O'Connor and Wilbur Snyder defeated Larry Hennig and Harley Race to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title on 2 December to Mitsu Arakawa and Dr. Moto. O'Connor and Snyder also defeated Arakawa and Moto for the World Wrestling Association's WWA World Tag Team Championship on 24 September 1968. They lost the title on 26 October to the same team. = Late career = On 13 October 1970, O'Connor was introduced as Jim Crockett Promotions's first NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Champion as part of a storyline to introduce the title. The title was later awarded to the Missouri Mauler with the announcement that Mauler won it in New York. On 1 January 1982, O'Connor was part of the card that comprised promoter Sam Muchnick's last professional wrestling show, located in St. Louis. O'Connor was also one of the owners of the St. Louis Wrestling Club. O'Connor, along with Verne Gagne, Harley Race, and Bob Geigel purchased the territory from Sam Muchnick the day after Muchnick's retirement. On 18 September 1963, O'Connor was named as a co-conspirator in the monopoly that controlled professional wrestling in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa. O'Connor filed a counterclaim. On 16 November 1987, O'Connor participated in a World Wrestling Federation \\"old-timers\\" battle royal, which was won by Lou Thesz.  Death  O'Connor died of cancer on 16 August 1990. In December 1990, World Championship Wrestling held the Pat O'Connor Memorial International Cup Tag Team Tournament, an eight-team international tag team memorial tournament at Starrcade in honor of O'Connor. In 1996, he was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. In 2007, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted O'Connor. He is also a member of the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2016, O'Connor became a \\"Legacy\\" member of the WWE Hall of Fame.

It consists of a rotating ground antenna and transponders in aircraft. The ground antenna sweeps a narrow vertical beam of microwaves around the airspace. When the beam strikes an aircraft, the transponder transmits a return signal back giving information such as altitude and the Squawk Code, a four digit code assigned to each aircraft that enters a region. Information about this aircraft is then entered into the system and subsequently added to the controller's screen to display this information when queried. This information can include flight number designation and altitude of the aircraft. ATCRBS assists air traffic control (ATC) surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored, and providing this information to the radar controllers. The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as targets) and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter. Parts of the system The system consists of transponders, installed in aircraft, and secondary surveillance radars (SSRs), installed at air traffic control facilities. The SSR is sometimes co-located with the primary surveillance radar, or PSR. These two radar systems work in conjunction to produce a synchronized surveillance picture. The SSR transmits interrogations and listens for any replies. Transponders that receive an interrogation decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with the requested information when appropriate. Note that in common informal usage, the term \\"SSR\\" is sometimes used to refer to the entire ATCRBS system, however this term (as found in technical publications) properly refers only to the ground radar itself. antenna system of a typical air traffic control radar, the ASR-9. The curved reflector antenna on the bottom is the primary surveillance radar (PSR), and the flat antenna on top of it is the secondary surveillance radar (SSR). In operation the antenna rotates about a vertical axis, sweeping a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the local airspace to locate and track aircraft. =Ground Interrogation Equipment= An ATC ground station consists of two radar systems and their associated support components. The most prominent component is the PSR. It is also referred to as skin paint radar because it shows not synthetic or alpha- numeric target symbols, but bright (or colored) blips or areas on the radar screen produced by the RF energy reflections from the target's \\"skin.\\" This is a non-cooperative process, no additional avionic devices are needed. The radar detects and displays reflective objects within the radar's operating range. Weather radar data is displayed in skin paint mode. The primary surveillance radar is subject to the radar equation that says signal strength drops off as the fourth power of distance to the target. Objects detected using the PSR are known as primary targets. The second system is the secondary surveillance radar, or SSR, which depends on a cooperating transponder installed on the aircraft being tracked. The transponder emits a signal when it is interrogated by the secondary radar. In a transponder based system signals drop off as the inverse square of the distance to the target, instead of the fourth power in primary radars. As a result, effective range is greatly increased for a given power level. The transponder can also send encoded information about the aircraft, such as identity and altitude. The SSR is equipped with a main antenna, and an omnidirectional \\"Omni\\" antenna at many older sites. Newer antennas (as in the adjacent picture), are grouped as a left and right antenna, and each side connects to a hybrid device which combines the signals into sum and difference channels. Still other sites have both the sum and difference antenna, and an Omni antenna. Surveillance aircraft, e.g. AWACS, have only the sum and difference antennas, but can also be space stabilized by phase shifting the beam down or up when pitched or rolled. The SSR antenna is typically fitted to the PSR antenna, so they point in the same direction as the antennas rotate. The omnidirectional antenna is mounted near and high, usually on top of the radome if equipped. Mode-S interrogators require the sum and difference channels to provide the monopulse capability to measure the off-boresight angle of the transponder reply. The SSR repetitively transmits interrogations as the rotating radar antenna scans the sky. The interrogation specifies what type of information a replying transponder should send by using a system of modes. There have been a number of modes used historically, but four are in common use today: mode 1, mode 2, mode 3/A, and mode C. Mode 1 is used to sort military targets during phases of a mission. Mode 2 is used to identify military aircraft missions. Mode 3/A is used to identify each aircraft in the radar's coverage area. Mode C is used to request/report an aircraft's altitude. Two other modes, mode 4 and mode S, are not considered part of the ATCRBS system, but they use the same transmit and receive hardware. Mode 4 is used by military aircraft for the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. Mode S is a discrete selective interrogation, rather than a general broadcast, that facilitates TCAS for civilian aircraft. Mode S transponders ignore interrogations not addressed with their unique identity code, reducing channel congestion. At a typical SSR radar installation, ATCRBS, IFF, and mode S interrogations will all be transmitted in an interlaced fashion. Some military facilities and/or aircraft will also utilize Mode S. Returns from both radars at the ground station are transmitted to the ATC facility using a microwave link, a coaxial link, or (with newer radars) a digitizer and a modem. Once received at the ATC facility, a computer system known as a radar data processor associates the reply information with the proper primary target and displays it next to the target on the radar scope. =Airborne Transponder Equipment= The equipment installed in the aircraft is considerably simpler, consisting of the transponder itself, usually mounted in the instrument panel or avionics rack, and a small L band UHF antenna, mounted on the bottom of the fuselage. Many commercial aircraft also have an antenna on the top of the fuselage, and either or both antennas can be selected by the flight crew. Typical installations also include an altitude encoder, which is a small device connected to both the transponder and the aircraft's static system. It provides the aircraft's pressure altitude to the transponder, so that it may relay the information to the ATC facility. The encoder uses 11 wires to pass altitude information to the transponder in the form of a Gillham Code, a modified binary Gray code. A light aircraft transponder The transponder has a small required set of controls and is simple to operate. It has a method to enter the four-digit transponder code, also known as a beacon code or squawk code, and a control to transmit an ident, which is done at the controller's request (see SPI pulse below). Transponders typically have 4 operating modes: Off, Standby, On (Mode-A), and Alt (Mode-C). On and Alt mode differ only in that the On mode inhibits transmitting any altitude information. Standby mode allows the unit to remain powered and warmed up but inhibits any replies, since the radar is used for searching the aircraft and exact location of aircraft. Theory of operation The steps involved in performing an ATCRBS interrogation are as follows: First, the ATCRBS interrogator periodically interrogates aircraft on a frequency of 1030 MHz. This is done through a rotating or scanning antenna at the radar's assigned Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF). Interrogations are typically performed at 450 - 500 interrogations/second. Once an interrogation has been transmitted, it travels through space (at the speed of light) in the direction the antenna is pointing until an aircraft is reached. When the aircraft receives the interrogation, the aircraft transponder will send a reply on 1090 MHz after a 3.0 Œºs delay indicating the requested information. The interrogator's processor will then decode the reply and identify the aircraft. The range of the aircraft is determined from the delay between the reply and the interrogation. The azimuth of the aircraft is determined from the direction the antenna is pointing when the first reply was received, until the last reply is received. This window of azimuth values is then divided by two to give the calculated \\"centroid\\" azimuth. The errors in this algorithm cause the aircraft to jitter across the controllers scope, and is referred to as \\"track jitter.\\" The jitter problem makes software tracking algorithms problematic, and is the reason why monopulse was implemented. =The interrogation= Interrogations consist of three pulses, 0.8 Œºs in duration, referred to as P1, P2 and P3. The timing between pulses P1 and P3 determines the mode (or question) of the interrogation, and thus what the nature of the reply should be. P2 is used in side-lobe suppression, explained later. Mode 3/A uses a P1 to P3 spacing of 8.0 Œºs, and is used to request the beacon code, which was assigned to the aircraft by the controller to identify it. Mode C uses a spacing of 21 Œºs, and requests the aircraft's pressure altitude, provided by the altitude encoder. Mode 2 uses a spacing of 5 Œºs and requests the aircraft to transmit its Military identification code. The latter is only assigned to Military aircraft and so only a small percentage of aircraft actually reply to a mode 2 interrogation. =The reply= Replies to interrogations consist of 15 time slots, each 1.45 Œºs in width, encoding 12 + 1 bits of information. The reply is encoded by the presence or absence of a 0.45 Œºs pulse in each slot. These are labeled as follows: F1 C1 A1 C2 A2 C4 A4 X B1 D1 B2 D2 B4 D4 F2 SPI The F1 and F2 pulses are framing pulses, and are always transmitted by the aircraft transponder. They are used by the interrogator to identify legitimate replies. These are spaced 20.3 Œºs apart. The A4, A2, A1, B4, B2, B1, C4, C2, C1, D4, D2, D1 pulses constitute the \\"information\\" contained in the reply. These bits are used in different ways for each interrogation mode. For mode A, each digit in the transponder code (A, B, C, or D) may be a number from zero to seven. These octal digits are transmitted as groups of three pulses each, the A slots reserved for the first digit, B for the second, and so on. In a mode C reply, the altitude is encoded by a Gillham interface, Gillham code, which uses Gray code. The Gillham interface is capable of representing a wide range of altitudes, in increments. The altitude transmitted is pressure altitude, and corrected for altimeter setting at the ATC facility. If no encoder is attached, the transponder may optionally transmit only framing pulses (most modern transponders do). In a mode 3 reply, the information is the same as a mode A reply in that there are 4 digits transmitted between 0 and 7. The term mode 3 is utilized by the military, whereas mode A is the civilian term. The X bit is currently only used for test targets. This bit was originally transmitted by BOMARC missiles that were used as air-launched test targets. This bit may be used by drone aircraft. The SPI pulse is positioned 4.35Œºs past the F2 pulse (3 time slots) and is used as a \\"Special Identification Pulse\\". The SPI pulse is turned on by the \\"identity control\\" on the transponder in the aircraft cockpit when requested by air traffic control. The air traffic controller can request the pilot to ident, and when the identity control is activated, the SPI bit will be added to the reply for about 20 seconds (two to four rotations of the interrogator antenna) thereby highlighting the track on the controllers display. Side lobe suppression The SSR's directional antenna is never perfect; inevitably it will \\"leak\\" lower levels of RF energy in off-axis directions. These are known as side lobes. When aircraft are close to the ground station, the side lobe signals are often strong enough to elicit a reply from their transponders when the antenna is not pointing at them. This can cause ghosting, where an aircraft's target may appear in more than one location on the radar scope. In extreme cases, an effect known as ring-around occurs, where the transponder replies to excess resulting in an arc or circle of replies centered on the radar site. To combat these effects, side lobe suppression (SLS) is used. SLS employs a third pulse, P2, spaced 2Œºs after P1. This pulse is transmitted from the omnidirectional antenna (or the antenna difference channel) by the ground station, rather than from the directional antenna (or the sum channel). The power output from the omnidirectional antenna is calibrated so that, when received by an aircraft, the P2 pulse is stronger than either P1 or P3, except when the directional antenna is pointing directly at the aircraft. By comparing the relative strengths of P2 and P1, airborne transponders can determine whether or not the antenna is pointing at the aircraft when the interrogation was received. The power to the difference antenna pattern (for systems so equipped) is not adjusted from that of the P1 and P3 pulses. Algorithms are used in the ground receivers to delete replies on the edge of the two beam patterns. To combat these effects more recently, side lobe suppression (SLS) is still used, but differently. The new and improved SLS employs a third pulse, spaced 2Œºs either before P3 (a new P2 position) or after P3 (which should be called P4 and appears in the Mode S radar and TCAS specifications). This pulse is transmitted from the directional antenna at the ground station, and the power output of this pulse is the same strength as the P1 and P3 pulses. The action to be taken is specified in the new and improved C74c as: Any requirement at the transponder to detect and act upon a P2 pulse 2Œºs after P1 has been removed from the new and improved TSO C74c specification. Most \\"modern\\" transponders (manufactured since 1973) have an \\"SLS\\" circuit which suppresses reply on receipt of any two pulses in any interrogation spaced 2.0 microseconds apart that are above the MTL Minimum Triggering Level threshold of the receiver amplitude discriminator (P1->P2 or P2->P3 or P3->P4). This approach was used to comply with the original C74c and but also complies with the provisions of the new and improved C74c. The FAA refers to the non-responsiveness of new and improved TSO C74c compliant transponders to Mode S compatible radars and TCAS as \\"The Terra Problem\\", and has issued Airworthiness Directives (ADs) against various transponder manufacturers, over the years, at various times on no predictable schedule. The ghosting and ring around problems have recurred on the more modern radars. To combat these effects most recently, great emphasis is placed upon software solutions. It is highly likely that one of those software algorithms was the proximate cause of a mid-air collision recently, as one airplane was reported at showing its altitude as the pre-flight paper filed flight plan, and not the altitude assigned by the ATC controller (see the reports and observations contained in the below reference ATC Controlled Airplane Passenger Study of how radar worked). See the reference section below for errors in performance standards for ATCRBS transponders in the US. See the reference section below for FAA Technician Study of in-situ transponders. Radar display Detail of a radarscreen: a target in skin paint mode (amber) and as synthetic video (white) The beacon code and altitude were historically displayed verbatim on the radar scope next to the target, however modernization has extended the radar data processor with a flight data processor, or FDP. The FDP automatically assigns beacon codes to flight plans, and when that beacon code is received from an aircraft, the computer can associate it with flight plan information to display immediately useful data, such as aircraft callsign, the aircraft's next navigational fix, assigned and current altitude, etc. near the target in a data block. Although the ATCRBS does not display aircraft heading.Jeppesen Mode S Mode S, or mode select, despite also being called a mode, is actually a radically improved system intended to replace ATCRBS altogether. A few countries have mandated mode S, and many other countries, including the United States, have begun phasing out ATCRBS in favor of this system. Mode S is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing ATCRBS technology. Mode S, despite being called a replacement transponder system for ATCRBS, is actually a data packet protocol which can be used to augment ATCRBS transponder positioning equipment (radar and TCAS). One major improvement of Mode S is the ability to interrogate a single aircraft at a time. With old ATCRBS technology, all aircraft within the beam pattern of the interrogating station will reply. In an airspace with multiple interrogation stations, ATCRBS transponders in aircraft can be overwhelmed. By interrogating one aircraft at a time, workload on the aircraft transponder is greatly reduced. The second major improvement is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth of the aircraft is determined by the half split (centroid) method. The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display. The Mode S system also includes a more robust communications protocol, for a wider variety of information exchange. this capability is becoming mandatory across Europe with some states already requiring its use. =Diversity Operations= Diversity Mode S transponders may be implemented for the purpose of improving air-to-air surveillance and communications. Such systems shall employ two antennas, one mounted on the top and the other on the bottom of the aircraft. Appropriate switching and signal processing channels to select the best antenna on the basis of the characteristics of the received interrogation signals shall also be provided. Such diversity systems, in their installed configuration, shall not result in degraded performance relative to that which would have been produced by a single system having a bottom-mounted antenna. =Frequency Congestion, FRUIT= Mode S was developed as a solution to frequency congestion on both the uplink and downlink frequencies (1030 and 1090MHz). The high coverage of radar service available today means that some radar sites receive transponder replies from interrogations that were initiated by other nearby radar sites. This results in FRUIT, or False Replies Unsynchronous In Time, which is the reception of replies at a ground station that do not correspond with an interrogation. This problem has worsened with the increasing prevalence of technologies like TCAS, in which individual aircraft interrogate one another to avoid collisions. Finally, technology improvements have made transponders increasingly affordable such that today almost all aircraft are equipped with them. As a result, the sheer number of aircraft replying to SSRs has increased. Defruiter circuitry clears FRUIT from the display. = Mode S as a Congestion Solution = Mode S attempts to reduce these problems by assigning aircraft a permanent mode S address, derived from the aircraft's internationally assigned registration number. It then provides a mechanism by which an aircraft can be selected, or interrogated such that no other aircraft reply. The system also has provisions for transferring arbitrary data both to and from a transponder. This aspect of mode S makes it a building block for many other technologies, such as TCAS 2, Traffic Information Service (TIS), and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast.

Founded in 1975, the band featured members of keyboardist Dave Stewart's band Hatfield and the North and Alan Gowen's band Gilgamesh, including guitarists Phil Miller and Phil Lee and bassist Mont Campbell as original members. The band was named after Stewart's National Health glasses. Bill Bruford (previously of Yes and King Crimson) was the initial drummer but was soon replaced by Pip Pyle. Campbell was replaced by Neil Murray and then John Greaves. Alan Gowen stopped performing with the group after their first album, but returned for their final tours replacing Dave Stewart who resigned after their second album. Guitarist Phil Miller was National Health's only constant member. A frequently changing line-up, they toured extensively and released their first album, National Health in 1978. Although it was created during the rise of punk rock, the album is characterized by lengthy, mostly instrumental compositions.

A new generation of country artists emerged, influenced by contemporary rock music, singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan, and the liberal politics of the 1960s counterculture. Progressive country was a songwriter-based movement and many key artists had previously seen success writing for other artists in Nashville; writing for themselves, they were more concerned with expanding country music than creating hits. Foremost among these artists was Willie Nelson, who returned to Texas after deciding to focus on performing his own songs. Nelson soon attained a wide following and inspired other artists in Texas and Nashville. KOKE-FM, a radio station in Austin, Texas, introduced a progressive country music format during the early 1970s and continues to feature progressive country music. By the mid-1970s, progressive country artists entered the mainstream, usually in the form of cover versions by other artists. Progressive country also provided the basis for outlaw country, a harder-edged, more rock-oriented variant that achieved wide success in the late 1970s, as well as cowpunk and alternative country artists in the 1980s through today.

She is the third female music director to enter the Hindi film industry, after Jaddan Bai and Saraswati Devi and is one of the most commercially successful music directors in the male dominated music industry. She is most known for songs like Hum tum say juda ho ke (ek sapaira ek lutaira, 1965) \\"Chhodo kal ki baatein\\", \\"Shaayad meri shaadi ka khayal\\", \\"Zindagi pyaar ka geet hai\\" and \\"Aap to aise na the\\". She remained active for more than 3 decades from 1960s to 1980s. She is still active making some music for some movies and television-serials, more than 40 years after her debut as music director in Dil Deke Dekho (1959). She received a Filmfare Award nomination for composing the songs for the huge hit film Souten (1983). She was married to director, producer, lyricist, Sawan Kumar Tak, from whom she separated later on. Biography Born in Gwalior, her father, Manohar Khanna, was a lyricist and singer, working as Assistant Superintendent in the Water Works Department in then Gwalior State. When he came to Bombay (now Mumbai) for some work in 1946 he met Jaddanbai who was mother of Hindi film actress Nargis Dutt. On her request he started writing Gazals for Hindi films by the name, Jaaved Anwar .He was getting a monthly salary of Rs. 250 in Gwalior State and Jaddanabi offered him Rs. 800 for 3 gazals which he wrote for Jaddanbai,s Nargis Art Productions film Romeo Juliet . Usha Khanna did often take inspiration from Arabic music, which she liked and she claims that she has never lifted any song directly, but that she has composed something along the lines. The popular music director O. P. Nayyar introduced Usha Khanna to Sashadhar Mukherjee, a powerful man in the Indian film industry at that time. She sang a song for Mukherjee, and when he realised that she had composed the song on her own, he told her to compose two songs per day for one year. After a few months, Mukherjee signed her as the composer for his movie Dil Deke Dekho (1959) as a music composer. The film, which also introduced the actress Asha Parekh, became a big hit, and Mukherjee hired her again for another Asha Parekh starrer Hum Hindustani (1961). After she started composing music for Hindi movies, Usha Khanna struggled to establish herself as a music director, despite producing many hit songs. She often collaborated with Asha Bhosle, who referred to Usha Khanna as her daughter, and Mohammed Rafi. This trio produced many hit songs. Many of songs sung by Mohammed Rafi under composition of Usha Khanna are still very popular and will be everlasting forever. DIL DEKE DEKHO (1959). HAWAS (1974), SAJAAN KI SAHELI (1981),AAP THO AISE NA THE (1980) as to named a few good songs of movie of Rafi Usha Association. Saawan Kumar was often the lyricist for Usha Khanna, and wrote most of his lyrics for her songs. He directed and produced the lyrics for eleven movies she scored the music for. In 1979 K. J. Yesudas received Filmfare award for her song Dil ke tukde tukde in the film Dada. Usha Khanna was married to Sawan Kumar Tak but later they separated and she lives in Bombay (present name Mumbai). The effort she had put earlier in life to establish herself in the industry, made her realise how difficult it was to break through, and this made her often give the chance to new singers. She gave the chance to the singers who were little known at that time ‚Äì Anupama Deshpande, Pankaj Udhas, Hemlata, Mohammed Aziz, Roop Kumar Rathod, Shabbir Kumar, and Sonu Nigam. Many of these went on to become notable singers. Usha Khanna herself also sang a few songs as a playback singer. Many of Usha Khanna's songs are still very popular. Some of the other movies she provided for are 'Shabnam', 'Aankh Micholi', Saajan Bina Suhagan, 'Sautan', 'Sajan ki Saheli', 'Ab Kya Hoga', 'Lal Bungalow', 'Dada', 'Do Khiladi', 'Hanste Khelte'. Usha Khanna remained quite active as a composer until the mid-nineties. Until now, the last movie she has given music to was in 2003. The movie was Dil Pardesi Ho Gaya, produced and directed by her ex-husband Saawan Kumar who she was briefly married to. Usha Khanna has given music to non-Hindi movies too. The Malayalam movie Moodal Manju (1969) is still remembered for some of the finest songs in Malayalam including 'Nee Madhu Pakaroo' by K. J. Yesudas and 'Maanasa Mani veenayil' by S.Janaki.

In humans, this body is a derivative of the ventral recess of the fourth pharyngeal pouch (technically fifth, but that one is rudimentary and merges with the fourth). The cells that give rise to the parafollicular cells are actually derivatives of the endoderm. These cells migrate and associate with the ultimopharyngeal body during development.

When Muhammad and Abu Bakr migrated from Mecca in September 622, Abu Bakr instructed Abdallah to listen to adult conversations and to report the day's news to them at the cave on Mount Thawr each night. Abdullah duly reported that the Quraysh had offered a hundred camels to anyone who captured Muhammad.

The Trust is dedicated to land and marine conservation, native habitat restoration, protection of endangered species, freshwater ecosystem protection, and reduction in the loss of New Zealand's unique biodiversity. TerraNature works to provide a greater public awareness of environmental issues in New Zealand, and the international importance of the nation's 'edge ecology' which evolved in isolation for 80 million years, after Zealandia broke away from the ancient Gondwana continent. The country is a biological treasure chest with the world's largest collection of flightless birds, living fossils of reptiles and frogs that predate the dinosaurs, gigantism in insects, and 80 percent endemism in plants. TerraNature is also working to establish deep-sea marine reserves, initially along a chain of seamounts on the Kermadec Ridge. Associated with this is the Trust's opposition to deep seabed mineral mining that is proposed on seamounts, and provision of a greater awareness of whale migration through the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone, the impact of anthropogenic ocean noise on marine animals, and the need for legislation to regulate natural resources in the deep-sea. Supporting organisation TerraNature is informally affiliated with, and supported by Terra Nature Fund, a California nonprofit public-benefit corporation based in San Francisco. The two organisations are jointly managed and share the terranature.org website. Terra Nature Fund is designated by the United States Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organisation, which allows United States taxpayers with an interest in supporting New Zealand conservation, to make tax-deductible donations.

Designed initially as a semi-automatic rifle, the weapon came with an overhead inserted magazine, an unconventional design based on the simplicity of allowing a spent round to be replaced using assistance from gravity. The gun was made from half of a Villar-Perosa aircraft submachine gun, and as such it can be considered the first submachine gun issued to and used by the Italian armed forces, and is possibly the first SMG used as a general-issue combat weapon. Certain sources say that it saw service a few weeks before the German MP 18; the exact date remains debated.

Wiebe, (February 18, 1893 - July 12, 1999) was a Canadian physician and politician. Wiebe was born to a Mennonite family in Altona, Manitoba. He was educated at Wesley College, the University of Manitoba and the Manitoba Medical College, receiving his MD in 1925. He practiced family medicine in Winkler, Manitoba from 1925 to 1978, and, according to local tradition, continued to practice on an informal basis after his retirement. Over the course of 53 years, he delivered over 6,000 babies. A member of the Liberal Party, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1932 provincial election, defeating Conservative incumbent Hugh McGavin by 447 votes in the Morden and Rhineland constituency. A coalition of Liberals and Progressives won this election, and Wiebe served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's coalition government for the next four years. Wiebe was the first Mennonite to serve in the Manitoba legislature. He did not seek re- election in 1936. Though his own political career was brief, he remained a lifetime supporter of the merged Liberal-Progressive Party and its successor, the Manitoba Liberal Party. Wiebe served as president of the Manitoba College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1945-46, and of the Manitoba Medical Association in 1952-53. He played a prominent role in establishing Winkler's Bethel Hospital in 1935, and the Valley Rehabilitation Centre in 1969. Along with four other doctors, he established the Winkler Medical Clinic in 1974. Wiebe also served on the Winkler school board from 1929 to 1953. At age 105, Wiebe became the oldest person in Canadian history to be granted the Order of Canada. He died in 1999, at age 106. The Manitoba legislature paid tribute to his life and held a moment of silence in his honour on December 13, 1999. In 1983, Mavis Reimer published a biography entitled Cornelius W. Wiebe: A Beloved Physician. As of 1999, Reimer's work was still available through Mennonite Books in Manitoba.

The terminology commonly used by clay shooters often relates to times past, when live-pigeon competitions were held. Although such competitions were made illegal in the United Kingdom in 1921, a target may still be called a \\"bird\\", a hit may be referred to as a \\"kill\\", and a missed target as a \\"bird away\\"; the machine which projects the targets is still known as a \\"trap\\".  History  Clay targets began to be used in place of live pigeons around 1875. Asphalt targets were later developed, but the name \\"clay targets\\" stuck. In 1893, the Inanimate Bird Shooting Association was formed in England. It was renamed to the Clay Bird Shooting Association in 1903. It held annual clay-pigeon-shooting contests and lasted until the outbreak of World War I. In 1921, the British parliament passed a bill without opposition making it illegal to shoot birds from traps.  Disciplines  Clay pigeon shooting has at least 20 different forms of regulated competition called disciplines, although most can be grouped under the main headings of trap, skeet, and sporting. =Sporting clays= The English Sporting discipline has the sport's biggest following. While the other disciplines only use standard targets, in Sporting almost anything goes. Targets are thrown in a great variety of trajectories, angles, speeds, elevations and distances and the discipline was originally devised to simulate live quarry shooting, hence some of the names commonly used on sporting stands: springing teal, driven pheasant, bolting rabbit, crossing pigeon, dropping duck, etc. Disciplines in this group include English sporting, international (FITASC) sporting, super sporting sportrap, and Compak sporting. This discipline can have an infinite variety of \\"stands\\". English sporting is the most popular form of clay shooting in the UK, and a course or competition will feature a given number of stands each of which has a predetermined number of targets, all traveling along the same path and speed, either as singles or doubles. Each stand will feature a different type of target; e.g., crosser, driven, quartering, etc. International (FITASC) sporting gives a much greater variety of targets in terms of trajectory and speed, and is shot by squads of six competitors in rounds of 25 targets at a time. Super Sporting is a hybrid of the two preceding varieties. There are also other formats such as Compak sporting and sportrap in which five cages are surrounded by a number of traps, and shooters fire a specific combinations or singles from each stand according to a program displayed in front of the cage. Maze clays shooting This is a new shotgun game that offers sporting clays and FITASC target presentations on a skeet/trap or open field. This is possible by using a movable support system that carries the release buttons (wired or wireless setup) from 6 to 9 traps and the dual safety screen in any place on the field. As a result, the shooter can shoot in safe conditions upon target presentations in varying range (10 to 60 yards) and varying angles (sharp to wide). =Trap shooting= Targets are thrown either as singles or doubles from one or more traps situated some 15 m in front of the shooter, and are generally going away from the firing point at varying speeds, angles and elevations. The most common disciplines in this group are: *Down-The-Line (DTL) Single Barrel *Double Rise *Automatic Ball Trap (ABT) *Olympic Trap *Double Trap *Universal Trench *Helice (or ZZ) Down-the- Line Also known as DTL, this is a popular trap shooting discipline. Targets are thrown to a distance of 45 to 50 metres at a fixed height of approximately 2.75 m and with a horizontal spread of up to 22 degrees either side of the centre line. Each competitor shoots at a single target in turn, but without moving from the stand until all have shot five targets. Then they all move one place to the right, and continue to do so until they have all completed a standard round of 25 birds. Scoring of each target is 3 points for a first barrel kill, 2 points for a second barrel kill and 0 for a miss (maximum 75 points per round). Variations of this discipline are single barrel, double rise, and handicap-by-distance. Olympic trap As its name indicates, this is one of the disciplines which form part of the shooting programme at the Olympic Games. A trench in front of the shooting stands conceals 15 traps arranged in five groups of three. Shooters take turns to shoot at a target each, before moving in a clockwise direction to the next stand in the line. Targets for each shooter are thrown immediately upon his call and are selected by a shooting scheme (program) that ensures all competitors receive exactly the same target selection, but in an unpredictable randomised order to the extent that there will be one straight, two left and two right targets for each stand from any one of the three traps directly in front of him/her; guessing which one is next is impossible unless the shooter is on his/her last five targets. Olympic trap targets are set to travel 76 metres (+/-1m) at the top of trench level marker peg, unless the terrain is dead flat, at varying elevations and with a maximum horizontal angle of 45 degrees either side of the centre line (being where the target exits the trench). Scoring is on the basis of one point per target killed, regardless of whether this is achieved with the first or with the second barrel unless it is a final where the top six scorers shoot off as a single barrel event, regardless of local club grades if any. A simpler and cheaper to install variation of this discipline is known as automatic ball trap (ABT) where only one trap is used and target variation is obtained by the continuous oscillation of the trap in both horizontal and vertical directions in order to give the same spread of targets as in Olympic trap. Similarly, the targets are also thrown to a maximum of 76 metres. Also known as Bunker Trap, and International Trap Universal trench A variation on the theme of trap shooting, sometimes known as five trap. Five traps are installed in a trench in front of the shooting stands, all set at different angles, elevations and speeds, and upon the call of \\"Pull!\\" by the shooter any one of the five machines, selected at random, will be released. Horizontal angles can vary from 0 degrees to 45 degrees either side of the centre line and target distance is between 60 and 70 metres. Elevations can vary, as in other trap disciplines (except DTL), between 1.5 and 3.5 metres above ground level. There are 10 different schemes available. =Skeet shooting= Double Olympic gold medalist Vincent Hancock of the United States Army Marksmanship Unit taking part in a skeet shooting event Skeet is a word of Scandinavian origin, though the discipline originated in America. Targets are thrown in singles and doubles from 2 trap houses situated some 40 metres apart, at opposite ends of a semicircular arc on which there are seven shooting positions. The targets are thrown at set trajectories and speeds. The main disciplines in this group are English skeet, Olympic skeet and American (NSSA) skeet. In NSSA discipline, targets are released in a combination of singles and doubles, adding up to a total of 25 targets per round, from the High and Low trap houses on a fixed trajectory and speed. Variety is achieved by shooting round the seven stations on the semicircle, followed by an eighth station, located between stations one and seven. Scoring is on the basis of 1 point per target killed, up to a maximum of 25. In English skeet (by far the most popular of the skeet disciplines), the gun position is optional (i.e., pre-mounted or out-of-shoulder when the target is called) and the targets are released immediately upon the shooter's call. In Olympic skeet, the targets travel at a considerably faster speed, the release of the target can be delayed up to 3 seconds after calling and the gun-down position is compulsory. There is also an eighth shooting station, midway between the two houses. NSSA and English version of Skeet have the concept of option targets, where the shooter has to repeat the first missed target. In the situation where the first 24 targets are all hit, the last target is considered the option. Here is a representation of Skeet sequences for all variations. Electrocibles or helice shooting Originating in Belgium during the 1960s, Electrocibles is similar to trap shooting, but the clays are equipped with a helice that will give the clay an erratic and unpredictable flight. The helice is composed of two winged plastic propellers with a white clay in the centre. Now the sport is named helice shooting. Plastic propellers holding a detachable centre piece are rotated at high speed and released randomly from one of five traps. They fly out in an unpredictable way; so-said buzzing through the air. It is designed specifically to simulate as closely as possible the old sport of live pigeon shooting. Its original name of ZZ comes from the inventor who made them out of zinc, and had previously shot a specific breed of pigeon called a zurito; hence the term the zinc zurito. World and European Championships are held every year organized by FITASC.  Targets  The targets used for the sport are usually in the shape of an inverted saucer, made from a mixture of pitch and pulverized limestone rock designed to withstand being thrown from traps at very high speeds, but at the same time being easily broken when hit by just a very few lead or steel pellets from a shotgun. The targets are usually fluorescent orange or black, but other colours such as white, or yellow are frequently used in order that they can be clearly seen against varying backgrounds and/or light conditions. Targets are made to very exacting specifications with regard to their weight and dimensions and must conform to set international standards. There are several types of targets that are used for the various disciplines, with a standard 108 mm size being the most common used in American Trap, Skeet, and Sporting Clays while International disciplines of these same games use a slightly larger 110 mm diameter size. Only the standard 108/110 mm target is used in all of the trap and skeet disciplines. Sporting shoots feature the full range of targets (except ZZ) to provide the variety that is a hallmark of the discipline. All three sports use a shotgun, and in the sporting disciplines are sub-classified by the type of game the clay target represents (pigeon, rabbit, etc.). The two primary methods of projecting clay targets are airborne and ground (rolling). Naturally, the simplest method of throwing a clay target is by hand, either into the air or along the ground. This method is the simplest, and many \\"trick shot\\" shooters throw their own targets (some able to throw as many as ten birds up and hit each individually before any land). However, a multitude of devices have been developed to throw the birds more easily and with more consistency. A plastic sling-like device is the simplest, though modern shooting ranges will usually have machines that throw the clay targets in consistent arcs at the push of a button. ;Standard: The most commonly used target of all, must weigh 105 g and be of 110 mm overall diameter and 25‚Äì26 mm in height for International competitions and for American competitions they must weigh approximately and be of overall diameter and in height. ;Midi: Same saucer shape as the standard but with a diameter of only 90 mm; these targets are faster than the standard types. ;Mini: This target is sometimes likened to a flying bumblebee at only 60 mm in diameter and 20 mm in height. ;Battue: A very thin target measuring about 108‚Äì110 mm in diameter, it flies very fast and falls off very suddenly simulating a duck landing. They are generally more expensive than other targets. ;Rabbit: A thicker, but standard 108‚Äì110 mm diameter flat target in the shape of a wheel designed to run along the ground. ;ZZ: This is a plastic, standard sized target attached to the center of a two- blade propeller of different color designed to zigzag in flight in a totally unpredictable manner.  Traps  Clay pigeons in an automatic thrower Traps are purpose-made, spring-loaded, flywheel or rotational devices especially designed to launch the different types of targets in singles or pairs at distances of up to 100 metres. These machines vary from the very simple hand- cocked, hand-loaded and hand-released types to the highly sophisticated fully automatic variety, which can hold up to 600 targets in their own magazine and are electrically or pneumatically operated. Target release is by remote control, either by pressing a button or by an acoustic system activated by the shooter's voice. Target speeds and trajectories can be easily modified and varied to suit the discipline or type of shooting required.  Guns  Clay pigeon shooting is performed with a shotgun. The type of shotgun used is often a matter of taste and affected by local laws as well as the governing body of the sport in competitive cases. All types of shotguns are suitable for clay pigeon shooting, however the ability to fire multiple shots in quick succession is generally considered important. Some skilled shooters will use a single shot firearm in order to add to the challenge. Traditionally Over and Under and Side by Side shotguns have been popular, however semi-automatic and to a lesser extent pump-action have been making gains, particularly as the cost of reliable, accurate semi-automatics has come down over the last decade. ;Over And Under: (sometimes shortened to OAU or O/U) As its name indicates this gun has two barrels aligned horizontally and stacked vertically. There is usually one trigger however some models have two. Within this type there are three sub-groups of specification: trap, skeet, and sporting. Trap guns are generally heavier and longer barreled (normally ) with tight choking and designed to shoot slightly above the point of aim. Skeet guns are usually lighter and faster handling with barrel length from and with fairly open chokes. Sporting models most often come with an interchangeable choke facility and barrel lengths of , , and according to preference. ;Semi-auto: This is a single barreled gun that chambers a new shell from a magazine automatically after each shot, but which requires the shooter to press the trigger for each shot. This design combines reduced recoil and relatively low weight with quick follow up shots. ;Side-by-side: (sometimes shortened to SS or SXS) Like the over and under, there are two barrels, however instead of being arranged in a vertical stack they are next to each other on a horizontal plane. Side-by- sides are harder to aim for new shooters, as the two barrels does not provide the same instinctive feedback as the single visible barrel of a semi-automatic or O/U. Modern production of SXS weapons is limited, in favor of O/U, and older weapons are usually not rated for steel shot, preventing their use on many shooting ranges. ;Pump-action: This is a single barreled gun that reloads from a tubular or box magazine when the user slides a grip towards and then away from themselves. The pump-action format is popular with casual shooters in the US, but is far less common in Europe. The pump-action is inherently slower than all but the single barrel break action and thus follow up shots are more difficult. In addition to this, although their mechanical complexity is comparable to that of the semi-automatic they lack the latter's advantage of recoil reduction. ;Single-shot: Most single shot shotguns are break action; they operate similarly to the over and under and the side-by-side except they have only one barrel and can hold only one shot. Some are very inexpensive, and they are the most popular type of gun in American Trap. Most other clay pigeon shooting disciplines require guns capable of holding two shells. The low weight of some single-shot guns result in excessive recoil which further diminishes their appeal for high volume clay shooting.  Cartridges  Shotgun cartridges are readily available in gun shops and at shooting grounds, and within limitations as to the shot size and the weight of the shot load are suitable for clay shooting at CPSA affiliated grounds and for use in events coming under CPSA rules. Though home loaded cartridges allow the user to customize the ballistic characteristics of their shells, they are generally not allowed at clay pigeon shooting events unless specified otherwise. The instructions and specifications are printed on the boxes. For clay competition, shot size must not exceed 2.6 mm/English No. 6.Cartridges , Clay Pigeon Shooting Association rules. The shot load must be a maximum for all domestic disciplines; or for Olympic trap, Olympic skeet, and double trap; up to 28 g for FITASC sporting (from 2005); and for helice. Lasers Laser Clay Pigeon Shooting, also known as Laser Clay Shooting or even Laser Shooting, is a variation on the traditional sport of Clay Pigeon Shooting where the shotguns are disabled and fitted with laser equipment that can detect hits on specially modified reflective clays. Laser clay pigeon shooting offers a safe alternative for beginners. The rules and disciplines are normally the same as the traditional sport using live weapons. There are four principal pieces of equipment for a laser clay shooting setup: guns, launcher, scoreboard, and clays. File:Laser Clay Shooting Gun.jpgA laser clay shooting gun at a laser clay shooting range. File:Laser Clay Launcher.jpgLaser Clay Launcher/Trap The activity can be done indoors or outdoors. Just like traditional clay shooting clays are released from a trap and the participants shoot at the flying disc. Unlike traditional clay shooting, multiple participants all shoot at the same disc. In most equipment the register of hits and misses is recorded electronically, and the sounds of the shotgun firing and the clay being hit are played from simulated sounds. Although the activity is similar to traditional clay shooting it does use slightly different shooting principles, some of which are closer to target shooting.

It is the only genus in the subfamily Pseudopontiinae. It was traditionally thought to contain only one species (monotypic), Pseudopontia paradoxa. However, a recent study showed there are at least five species of Pseudopontia which can be distinguished genetically and by details of wing veins. Each is found primarily in a different part of Africa, though several of the species have overlapping geographic distributions. It is considered paradoxical because, despite being a true butterfly (Papilionoidea), its antennae do not have the characteristic clubbed ends which are otherwise diagnostic of butterflies (Rhopalocera).

The original Poppy Hills was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., and opened in 1986. Along with Pebble Beach Golf Links and Spyglass Hill Golf Course, Poppy Hills co-hosted the PGA Tour's AT&T; Pebble Beach National Pro- Am from 1991 to 2009, replacing Cypress Point in the rotation. Poppy Hills will co-host the Champions Tour's Nature Valley First Tee Open with Pebble Beach for three years, beginning in September of 2014. Poppy Hills was the first course in the United States to be owned and operated by an amateur golf association, the Northern California Golf Association. Poppy Hills is the headquarters and tournament home of the NCGA, which also owns Poppy Ridge Golf Course in Livermore. Poppy Hills was featured in the original Tiger Woods PGA Tour video game series in 1999, and was an active course through 2004. The new Poppy Hills has been widely heralded since it reopened in 2014. Golf.com Travel Writer Joe Passov said the new Poppy Hills has a \\"Pinehurst-like touch, with just a hint of near-neighbor Cypress Point.\\" Golf Getaways Travel Writer Vic Williams added about the new design, \\"at certain times it feels like Pinehurst, other times like Augusta, with dashes of Pine Valley.\\" Course Poppy Hills is the only course of the seven in Pebble Beach that plays exclusively in the forest. It is also unique because it features no rough and bentgrass greens, both of which are rare on the Monterey Peninsula. The renovation by RTJ II Golf Course Architects reduced the par from 72 to 71, but the yardage increased from 6,863 to 7,002. The entire course was topped with a 5-inch layer of sand, a process called sand capping, which dramatically improves the drainage, fostering firm and fast conditions year-round. All 18 greens were redesigned, reducing the strong undulations that previously existed. While the greens are roughly the same size as before, they are now easier to hit with a low-running shot because of the firmer conditions and elimination of rough. The renovation also softened the sharp doglegs and heavy mounding that previously existed. Naturalized waste areas and pine straw were added throughout the course, bringing the forest more into play while also reducing irrigated turf from 82 acres to 62, which has greatly improved water conservation efforts. The 12th hole was converted from a sharp dogleg-right par 5 to a straightaway par 4 that features an elevated tee and a view of the Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains, changing the par on the back nine from 36 to 35, and the overall par from 72 to 71. The 11th hole is the only brand new hole on the course, as it went from the longest par 3 on the property to the shortest, and plays in the opposite direction. Every hole was changed, but all the others stayed within their same routing. Poppy Hills also completely renovated its practice facility and clubhouse. The restaurant, Porter's at Poppy Hills, was also reinvented, and is now run by executive chef Johnny De Vivo, formerly of Casanova and La Bicyclette in Carmel. The practice facility is headed by Jeff Ritter, the founder of Make the Turn and a Golf Digest Best Young Teacher. AT&T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Poppy Hills replaced Cypress Point Club as one of the host courses of the AT&T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 1991. The switch occurred after the private club did not immediately admit an African-American member, despite the request of the Tour. Poppy Hills last hosted the AT&T; National Pro-Am in 2009. The AT&T; moved to Monterey Peninsula Country Club's Shore Course in 2010.

These songs of different titles are closely related, and two strands in particular became popular in commercial Country music and Folk music recordings of the twentieth century: the \\"Silver Dagger\\" version popularised by Joan Baez, and the \\"Katy Dear\\" versions popularised by close harmony brother duets such as The Callahan Brothers, The Blue Sky Boys and The Louvin Brothers. In \\"Silver Dagger\\", the female narrator turns away a potential suitor, as her mother has warned her to avoid the advances of men in an attempt to spare her daughter the heartbreak that she herself has endured. The 1960 recording by Joan Baez features only a fragment of the full ballad. \\"Katy Dear\\" uses the same melody but different lyrics, telling a similar story from a male perspective.Lyle Lofgren. \\"Remembering The Old Songs: KATIE DEAR (Laws G21).\\" 2002-03. Inside Bluegrass. Retrieved 2010-12-15. History =Origin= The song exists in a large number of variations under many different titles, and with lyrics that may show a mixture of different songs. Steve Roud observes on one version of the song titled \\"O! Molly Dear Go Ask Your Mother\\": :\\"A whole book could be written on this song and its connections with other songs which involve young men at their sweethearts' windows at night, disapproving parents and silver daggers. Hugely popular with North American traditional singers, 'Drowsy Sleeper' was also collected regularly in Britain and appeared on broadsides there from at least the 1820s\\" Roud, Steve, 2015, Song notes to My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean: British Songs in the USA (CD boxset), Nehi Records NEH3X1. Of interest are early versions of two songs, \\"Silver Dagger\\" and \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\", that are related thematically and may share a common origin in the older theme of night visit in traditional English songs, but they differ in lines, verse rhythm and outcome in their lyrics. The plot of \\"Silver Dagger\\" is similar to that of \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\" whereby the parents object to a match between a boy and a girl, except that in \\"Silver Dagger\\" the dagger is used as a suicide weapon by the young lovers, while in \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\" the couple elope. However, at some point in the 19th century, there also appears to have been a fusion of these two different songs whereby the tragic ending of \\"Silver Dagger\\" becomes attached to \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\", giving rise to some later variations of the song. The earliest known text of \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\" in Britain may be dated to 1817, and the first verse of a variant of the song appears in a songbook of American folk songs first published in 1855, John G. McCurry's The Social Harp. Early publications of \\"Silver Dagger\\" in the US may be found in Spirit of the Times and Gazette of the Union, Golden Rule and Odd-fellows' Family Companion in 1849. A version of \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\" published in a broadside as \\"Who's at My Bedroom Window?\\" by H. J. Wehman in 1890 shows a mixture of \\"Silver Dagger\\" and \\"Drowsy Sleeper\\". A version collected in Kentucky was printed in The Journal of American Folk- Lore in 1907, and three versions were collected by Henry M. Belden in 1908. Cecil Sharp published an English version from Somerset in 1908 as \\"Arise! Arise!\\". Sharp also collected a version of the song in the United States as \\"Awake, awake\\", sung by Mary Sands in Madison County, North Carolina on August 1, 1916. The differences in titles and some lyrics may also be a result of the song being handed down through the unwritten oral tradition, or adapting from different sources, and where each performer may add their own verses and nuances to the song. These songs have been sung using different tunes. Relation to other songs such as \\"Old Virginny\\"/\\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" and \\"Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies\\" have also been noted. =Early recordings= The song was recorded commercially as \\"O! Molly Dear Go Ask Your Mother\\" by Kelly Harrell in 1926, as \\"Sleepy Desert\\" by Wilmer Watts And The LoneLy Eagles in 1929, and as \\"Wake Up You Drowsy Sleeper\\" by The Oaks family in 1930. As \\"Katie Dear (Silver Dagger)\\" it was recorded by the Callahan Brothers in 1934, and as \\"Katie Dear\\" by the Blue Sky Boys in 1938. (Country music authority Bill C. Malone states that the Callahan Brothers learned traditional ballads like \\"Katie Dear\\" from their mother). In 1956 it was recorded by the Louvin Brothers. The song was part of the repertoire of the Country Gentlemen, who toured both the bluegrass and folk music circuits during the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1960s, \\"Katie Dear\\" was recorded by folk revival musicians, including Joan Baez, and Ian & Sylvia. Today it is commonly performed and recorded by bluegrass musicians.

Chavurot usually provide autonomous alternatives to established Jewish institutions and Jewish denominations. Most chavurot place an emphasis on egalitarianism in the broad sense (of which gender egalitarianism is one piece), depending on participation by the entire community rather than top-down direction by clergy. Origins The first havurah in the United States was formed in September 1960 in Whittier, California.Weiner, Rex. \\"Whittier Celebrates the Last Hurrah of America‚Äôs First Havurah\\". Forward. The Forward Association, Inc. July 13, 2011. However, most chavurot in America had their origins in the North American Jewish counter-cultural trends of the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, groups of young rabbis, academics, and political activists founded experimental chavurot for prayer and study, in reaction to what they perceived as an over-institutionalized and unspiritual North American Jewish establishment. Initially the main inspiration was the pietistic fellowships of the Pharisees and other ancient Jewish sects. Initially some of these groups, like the Boston-area Havurat Shalom, attempted to function as full-fledged rural communes after the model of their secular counterparts. Others formed as communities within the urban or suburban Jewish establishment. Although the leadership and ritual privileges were initially men-only, as in Orthodox Jewish practice, the second-wave feminism soon led to the full integration of women in these communities. Literature Apart from some tentative articles in Response Evidently distinct from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Response Magazine. and other Jewish student magazines, the early chavurot attracted little attention in the wider North American Jewish community. Then, in 1973, Michael and Sharon Strassfeld released The Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit. Patterned after the recently published counter-culture Whole Earth Catalog, the book served both as a basic reference on Judaism and American Jewish life, as well as a playful compendium of Jewish crafts, recipes, meditational practices, and political action ideas, all aimed at disaffected young Jewish adults. The Jewish Catalog became one of the best-selling books in American Jewish history to that date and spawned two sequels. A much more widespread chavurah movement soon emerged, including self-governing chavurot within Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist synagogues. Present Present-day chavurot include some chavurot that have functioned continuously since the 1970s, such as Fabrangen and Havurat Shalom, as well as a resurgent wave in independent Jewish communities that have been established post-2000. Both generations of chavurot gather annually at the National Havurah Committee's Summer Institute and at its regional retreats. Origin of term The concept of a Chavurah has ancient roots. The Talmud (Tractate Pesachim) uses the term chavurah to identify the group of people registered for a single Passover sacrifice, and who held a Seder together, in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Passover Seder is perhaps the prototypical group ritual (traditionally) held outside a synagogue involving the sharing of communal experiences, Jewish learning, and prayer.

It is situated to the north-west of the city centre, in the city council's Park and St Peter's wards.  History  The name 'Whitmore' is said by toponymists to come from the Old English 'hwit' (white) and 'mor' (moor - which was used to describe a marshy area) - possibly a foggy area of marsh land, and 'Reans' is said to possibly mean a type of furrow created during ploughing, designed to drain the land.David Horovitz's 'Place Names Of Staffordshire'. Another name used for the nearby area that West Park now stands on was the 'Hungry Leas' - hungry being used to describe land which was little or no use for agriculture.http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/listed/westpark.htm The 1842 Tithe map shows only Whitmore End House in the area. This was soon to change - Wolverhampton's population was rising rapidly in the mid-1800s - and so a 'new town' would be built to the north west of Wolverhampton. It was originally to be called 'New Hampton', as is known today from the street names Newhampton Roads east and west, but Whitmore Reans was commonly used and stuck.Anthony Rose - Images of England, Whitmore Reans (2000) The terraced housing that makes up the Whitmore Reans residential area was built alongside roads, cartways and tracks that radiated out from the town centre servicing fields that spread out towards Dunstall and Tettenhall. Newhampton Road (known then as Whitmore End Lane), Molineux Alley & what is now Staveley Road / Dunstall Road, as well as Waterloo Road (then called Wellington Road)Tithe Map of 1842 were the routes through the fields that houses would be built alongside & between.1890 Ordnance Survey Focal points in the Whitmore Reans area were Leicester Square, with its shops and circular iron gentleman's urinal, known under various names such as the 'Pepper Pot' and the 'Green Man', and the area of shops on Newhampton Road West, known to locals as 'West Market'. In 1924, the Courtaulds Company started constructing a factory on the former site of Dunstall Hall. Operating from 1926 onwards, the factory produced rayon yarn. Known to many generations and a visible landmark in Whitmore Reans and beyond for almost fifty years were the Courtaulds chimneys, known as the 'three sisters'. They were demolished in June 1973. The Farndale housing estate now stands on the former Courtaulds grounds.  Today  The areas population displays its recent history of immigration in the diversity of its residents. There are English, Afro-Caribbean, Asian, Polish, Kurdish, African, Irish and many other ethnicities residing in Whitmore Reans.http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/BF531746-52FC-48D5-9CBD- CC81B6C938DE/0/WhitmoreReans.pdf It also has a small number of student residents who reside at the nearby university campus on Waterloo Road, and in private lets dotted throughout the area. Historically, Whitmore Reans was considered to be quite a genteel part of Wolverhampton, being located next to the picturesque West Park. In the latter part of the 20th century, however, the area declined sharply, and while the last 20 years has seen some of the older housing stock brought up to date it is still home to some of the lowest social grades in the City. Molineux Stadium, home of Wolverhampton WanderersSince 1889, Whitmore Reans has been dominated by the Wolverhampton Wanderers football ground, Molineux Stadium, which stands on the eastern side of Waterloo Road. However, all signs of the original stadium disappeared during the first half of the 20th century and the oldest part of the current stadium was built in 1978. In 2000, as part of the regeneration, The Newhampton Arts Centre, a community arts centre was developed with lottery funding on the site of the old municipal grammar school and provides a venue for a culturally diverse range of arts activities. Although originally a community project, Newhampton Arts Centre has hosted a variety of events including Wolverhampton's first Strummerjam which was headlined by Wolverhampton born artists Kupid the King and Nathan Neone and Johannesburg born artist T33K1D. It has also been the preferred venue for artists and bands such as Akala and The City Hippies. Whitmore Reans has a shopping arcade which replaced some of the terraced housing called 'The Avion Centre', which has several shops, a Post Office, Three Cooks bakery, Nvision (Opticians), take- aways and a branch of the Lloyds TSB bank. There is also a library, located just outside the Avion Centre. New Hampton Road East and New Hampton Road West (which form the boundary between the Park and St Peter's wards) are secondary roads, but form the main route through Whitmore Reans. At the junction of the New Hampton Roads with Hunter and Clifford streets are several more shops, including the Sugar & Spice Asian catering store, the WV6 Internet Cafe, Burns + Dudgon Ltd electricians, The Fish Inn fish and chip shop, Mittu Jewellers, Jhoots Pharmacy, K. Ram & Sons convenience store, P.H. Services (appliance repairs etc.) and a branch of the charity Samaritans. On the corner of Hunter Street and St. Andrews Close is the Pak Continental convenience store. In 2005, Wolverhampton City Council investigated the Farndale estate, built on land formerly occupied by the Courtaulds factory. It was discovered that soil in the gardens of a small number of properties were contaminated with high levels of carbon disulphide, a chemical used in the manufacture of rayon. As a result of the investigation, and work alongside Akzo Nobel (the company who bought out Courtaulds in 1998), four vacant terraced properties in Welbury Gardens were demolished.http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/environment/pollution/land/courtaulds_case_study.htm Whitmore Reans is often in the press today for adverse reasons - gang warfare, violence and murder appear heavily reported in the local press.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-black-country-11004784 Youths charged with Whitmore Reans stab murderhttps://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/11/18/cctv-captures-shotgun- drama-at-shop/ CCTV Captures Shotgun Drama At Shophttps://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/11/23/wolverhampton-college- lecturer-mandy-finn-stabbed-to-death/ Lecturer Stabbed To Deathhttps://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/08/14/first-picture-of-murder- victim-raziul-hassan/ First picture of murder victim Raziul Hassan The policing team who cover Whitmore Reans regularly tweet about policing in the area on the social networking site Twitter (@StaveleyPolice).  Public Houses  The Newhampton Inn, Whitmore Reans Whitmore Reans has a good selection of public houses, some tucked away amongst the Victorian terraced streets. On Fawdry Street is The Stile Inn, a traditional Victorian corner pub, with a bowls green at the back. On Jackson Street / Craddock Street is a moderner pub, The Pegasus. On Newhampton Road East, near to the Avion Centre, is The Bagot Arms. On the corner of Sweetman Street and Riches Street is The Newhampton - another Victoran corner pub favoured by CAMRA members, with great ale selection and a bowls green (closed permanently early October 2018). Just up the road on Newhampton Road West is The Summer House, and on Waterloo Road near the Molineux is The Goal Post(renamed The Leaping Wolf in 2018). Also, though not strictly a pub, the Whitmore Reans Working Mens Club on Bitterne Drive. Sadly, from 2000 onwards, there have been a few pub closures. The Tipster (the corner of Dunstall Road & Lowe Street - demolished, replaced with flats), The Victoria (Gatis Street - in a state of ruin & boarded up), The Red Lion (demolished - now new housing on Great Hampton Street) and the pub next door on Great Hampton Street, The Ash Tree, once a favourite with Wolverhampton Wanderers fans, is no longer a pub.

Biography Born in Leeds on 15 September 1847, Ernest was son of John Crofts, Esq. of Adal, near Leeds, a Justice of the Peace, and grandson of the Rev. W. Crofts, B.D., Vicar of North Grimston, near Malton, Yorkshire. One of his maternal uncles was the Rev. William Carr, B.D. of Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire. His mother was Ellen Wordsworth, the daughter of a Leeds industrialist. Ernest studied at Rugby School, for several years, and then headed to Berlin where he developed his interest in art and decided upon a career as a painter. His first acquaintance with war was made in 1864 when he accompanied a Prussian doctor in the Schleswig-Holstein War, and the operations around D√ºppel.The London Figaro, 13 April 1889 His sister Ellen Wordsworth Crofts married Sir Francis Darwin and was the mother of poet Frances Cornford. He returned to London and became a pupil under A. B. Clay, but was back in Germany a few years later, this time studying at the D√ºsseldorf school of painting in Europe, where he studied under the German military artist, Emil H√ºnten, himself an ex-pupil of Horace Vernet, and at the time military and historical painter to the Prussian emperor. Under H√ºnten, Crofts' talent as a military painter grew, and in 1874, he exhibited Retreat, representing an episode in the Franco-Prussian War during the Battle of Gravelotte, and in the same year, another scene from the same conflict, One touch of nature makes the whole world kin which won him the Crystal Palace prize medal. Both scenes were influenced by the artist's experience of witnessing some of the closing stages of the war, especially the battles of Weissenbourg, W√∂rth, and the siege of Strasbourg. While contributing regularly to the annual Royal Academy exhibition, he continued to live in D√ºsseldorf where he met his future wife. Ligny by Ernest Crofts (1875) In 1875, Crofts exhibited Ligny at the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) and at the International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The following year saw his picture representing The morning of the Battle of Waterloo which captured the dawn of the day with the tired and bespattered troops. One critic described it as follows: \\"Mr. Crofts' large canvas is admirable in the grouping of the soldiers on the morning of the battle; the day is breaking, on a weary, wounded and mud- stained company, some lying on the bare ground with knapsacks for pillows, some up and preparing for the march. The artillery are just on the move, and the note of preparation is sounding. The tone of the picture reminds us of the French school\\".Royal Academy annual report, 1880, pp. 351-352 The artist's first notable pictures of the English Civil War were exhibited in 1877, one of which depicted Oliver Cromwell at Marston Moor. In the same year, he refused the offer of an appointment of military painter to the Prince of Roumania to be attached to his staff during the Russo-Turkish War. Crofts was elected an Associate of the RA on 19 July 1878, the year that his picture, Wellington on his march from Quatre Bras to Waterloo was shown. In the same year, his painting entitled The Morning of the Battle of Waterloo was shown at the Paris International Exhibition; this depicted the French army retiring from the battlefield, with Napoleon leaving his carriage and preparing to mount his horse. The artist walked and sketched much of the area around the battlefield of Waterloo including La Haye Sainte, Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance. In 1896, he was elected a full academician of the Royal Academy, and his Diploma Work, a Civil War scene, was entitled To the Rescue. Two years later he succeeded Philip Calderon as keeper and trustee of the RA, which gave him accommodation at Burlington House. He was in effect chief director of the academy art schools as well as chief custodian of the Diploma Galley, which required \\"firmness, kindness and tact,\\" according to one obituary, and Crofts was noted for his \\"pleasant manner, his good looks, and his amiability of character\\" which made him an ideal keeper.obituary, The Times, 20 March 1911 Besides historical scenes, Crofts did paint some contemporary military events. In 1901, for instance, the king commissioned him to paint a picture of the distribution of the war medals following the Boer War. Two years later, he painted a large scene of the funeral of Queen Victoria. One of his most ambitious works was the panel in the ambulatory of the Royal Exchange which portrayed Elizabeth I opening the first Royal Exchange in 1571. His trilogy of paintings chronicling the final moments, death and burial of Charles I were popular, but there was some disagreement over the representation of the block upon which the king knelt to be beheaded. Some argued about the accuracy, contending that the block of the period was a lower one, being just a few inches from the ground, and that to reach it, the king would have had to lie flat. Crofts lived at 'The Green' which he helped to re-design, next to Blythburgh church in Suffolk. He had married a German lady, Elizabeth W√ºsthofen of D√ºsseldorf, and they had one daughter. The artist died of pneumonia at Burlington House on 19 March 1911. His funeral service was held at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, on Thursday 23 March, followed by his burial at Kensal Green Cemetery. A sale of his remaining works was held at Christie, Manson & Woods on Monday 18 December 1911.Catalogue of Remaining Works of Ernest Crofts, R.A. deceased.... London, Christie, Manson & Woods, 1911 While Crofts's pictures were popular in the 1870s and 1880s, the public lost its appetite for war paintings in the early years of the 20th century following the setbacks in South Africa. His obituary noted that \\"his taste was a little theatrical, and his talent not good enough to redeem it...it is safe to say that he will be best remembered, not by them, but by his good work at the Academy Schools and by his administrative services to the body of which he was a useful member...the exacting taste of the present day asks for something less conventional than his rather superficial battle scenes\\".obituary, ibid While the artist's pictures continue to be used as illustration in history and military books, today he is rarely mentioned as a significant historical artist.

The lyrics include a dialogue between the lovers. History The first published version of the song appeared in Roxburghe Ballads dated 1710; the lyrics were there given the title \\"The True Lover's Farewell\\". In 1907, the composer and folk-song scholar Ralph Vaughan Williams recorded David Penfold, an innkeeper from Rusper, Sussex, singing \\"Turtle Dove\\", and the recording is available online via the British Library Sound Archive. Lyrical content \\"Fare Thee Well\\" shares several lyrics which parallel those of Robert Burns' \\"A Red, Red Rose\\". The lyrics are also strikingly similar to a folk song titled, \\"My Dear Mary Ann\\"BrownIII 300, \\"My Martha Ann\\" (1 text)Fowke/Johnston, pp. 142-143, \\"Mary Ann\\" (1 text, 1 tune)Fowke/MacMillan 48, \\"Mary Ann\\" (1 text, 1 tune)Lomax-FSNA 75, \\"Mary Ann\\" (1 text, 1 tune)Silber-FSWB, p. 147, \\"Mary Ann\\" (1 text)Bodleian, Johnson Ballads 1111, \\"My Mary Ann,\\" A. Ryle and Co. (London), 1845-1859; also Firth c.12(366), Firth that dates back to the mid-19th century. Similarities include the meter and rhyme scheme, as well as the alternative title of \\"Ten Thousand Miles\\". Lyrical similarities include the opening line, \\"Fare thee well my own true love\\", \\"Ten thousand miles or more\\" (word-for-word matches), and the question of seeing a dove or other bird crying for its love. The subjects of the songs are practically identical: Lovers mourning their separation and longing to return to one another. Musical arrangements In 1919, Vaughan Williams wrote an arrangement of the song, entitled \\"The Turtle Dove\\", for solo baritone (later re-arranged for solo and SATB choir). Tia Blake released a version of the song similar to Vaughan Williams' arrangement and the original phonograph recording on her album Folk Songs and Ballads: Tia Blake and Her Folk-group. The song has been recorded by Nic Jones, Joan Baez on her 1960 debut album, Mary Black, Eliza Carthy, Chad & Jeremy, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Liam Clancy, Marianne Faithfull, Burl Ives, Molina and Roberts, and June Tabor. Mary Chapin Carpinter's version was used in the movie Fly Away Home (1996). The King's Singers performed and recorded an arrangement of The Turtle Dove by their baritone Philip Lawson (composer and arranger) Lyrics The following lyrics were adapted by Vaughan Williams from the phonograph recording of David Penfold. > Fare you well my dear, I must be gone And leave you for a while If I roam > away I'll come back again Though I roam ten thousand miles, my dear Though I > roam ten thousand miles So fair though art my bonny lass So deep in love am > I But I never will prove false to the bonny lass I love Till the stars fall > from the sky my dear Till the stars fall from the sky The sea will never run > dry, my dear Nor the rocks never melt with the sun But I never will prove > false to the bonny lass I love Till all these things be done my dear Till > all these things be done O yonder doth sit that little turtle dove He doth > sit on yonder high tree A making a moan for the loss of his love As I will > do for thee my dear As I will do for thee References References 1-6 are transcribed from the Traditional Ballad Index website listed in \\"External Links\\" below External links * The Mudcat Cafe: DTStudy: My Dear Mary Ann * The Traditional Ballad Index: An Annotated Bibliography of the Folk Songs of the English-Speaking World hosted by California State University Fresno * Category:Folk ballads Category:Joan Baez songs Category:Chad & Jeremy songs Category:English songs Category:18th- century songs Category:1710 songs ","title":"Fare Thee Well (song)"},{"id":"2164185","text":"Speyeria zerene, the zerene fritillary, is a species of butterfly found in the western portions of the United States and Canada. Description Speyeria zerene is a medium-sized butterfly whose length ranges from 25‚Äì28 mm, and the wingspan is about 55 mm. The body of the butterfly is black with orange brown on the upperside of the wings. Also on the underside are black veins with black spots. The undersides of the wings have silver metallic spots. The wings and the body are both covered in fine hairs. Range The native range spread from Washington state to California. They are now found in Oregon and California. , they were found in numbers in Alpine County, California, at the 9,000 foot (2,700 m) level in the Sierra Nevada range. The best habitats for the butterflies are coastal salt spray meadows, montane meadows, and stabilized dunes. The grasslands provide larval host plants which are a very important component of their habitat. Subspecies About 15 subspecies are accepted. * S. z. behrensii (W. H.

The recovery program helped establish breeding programs in several zoos and colleges that provide captive rearing for Speyeria zerene. In late summer, female butterflies are captured after they have mated and then transferred to a facility where they are induced to lay eggs. After the eggs hatch, the larvae are stored in a refrigerator over winter in order to replicate the conditions of the season. After the winter dormancy, the larvae are fed and cared for until they pupate or are large enough to be returned to the wild. Speyeria zerene as seen in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada Other programs that are being implemented to help the wild population include the regular mowing of meadows by private home owners, and especially habitat restoration for properties owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. One of the most essential components of the Speyeria zerene habitat is the blue violet, or Viola adunca; it is used for the food and shelter of the early stages of a larva's life. However, the blue violet is also threatened by invasive species and the overgrowth of shrubs and trees in meadows. The facilities that have established breeding programs for the butterflies have also set up nurseries for the blue violets. These nurseries are mainly used to provide food for the larvae reared in these facilities, but some violets are also transported and planted in restoration sites. Life cycle The life cycle of Speyeria zerene begin when the pink-tan colored eggs hatch. Females lay these eggs on the dried stems and debris of the blue violet (Viola adunca). The larvae, which have spikes on their backs and are dark in color, emerge in the spring. The larvae grow in six stages of development (instars) and feed on the violet until it is time for the larvae to pupate, which they do on the violet. The pupae will remain there for approximately two weeks, until it emerges as a butterfly. The butterfly has a life expectancy of about three weeks. During this time the butterflies mate and feed solely on nectar. Females then lay eggs, and the life cycle starts again. Diet The diet of Speyeria zerene varies throughout its life history. When the larva emerges in the spring the diet consists solely on the leaves of the blue violet (Viola adunca). When the adult emerges from its chrysalis it will feed solely on nectar of flowers. It feeds on a variety of plants including ones from the family Asteraceae, its main source of nutrition, but other families of plants that the butterfly may feed on include thistles, asters, yarrow, and pearly everlasting.

Cellomics is the discipline of quantitative cell analysis using bioimaging methods and informatics with a workflow involving three major components: image acquisition, image analysis, and data visualization and management. These processes are generally automated. All three of these components depend on sophisticated software to acquire qualitative data, quantitative data, and the management of both images and data, respectively. Cellomics is also a trademarked term, which is often used interchangeably with high-content analysis (HCA) or high-content screening (HCS), but cellomics extends beyond HCA/HCS by incorporating sophisticated informatics tools. History HCS and the discipline of cellomics was pioneered by a once privately held company named Cellomics Inc., which commercialized instruments, software, and reagents to facilitate the study of cells in culture, and more specifically, their responses to potentially therapeutic drug-like molecules. In 2005, Cellomics was acquired by Fisher Scientific International, Inc., now Thermo Fisher Scientific, which continues developing cellomics-centered products under its Thermo Scientific‚Ñ¢ high content analysis product line. Applications Like many of the -omics, e.g., genomics and proteomics, applications have grown in depth and breadth over time. Currently there are over 40 different application areas that cellomics is used in, including the analysis of 3-D cell models, angiogenesis, and cell-signalling. Originally a tool used by the pharmaceutical industry for screening, cellomics has now expanded into academia to better understand cell function in the context of the cell. Cellomics is used in both academic and industrial life-science research in areas, such as cancer research, neuroscience research, drug discovery, consumer products safety, and toxicology; however, there are many more areas for which cellomics could provide a much deeper understanding of cellular function. Image analysis With HCA at its core, cellomics incorporates the flexibility of fluorescence microscopy, the automation and capacity of the plate reader, and flow cytometry‚Äôs multi-parametric analysis in order to extract data from single- cells or from a population of cells. Once an image is acquired using high content technology hardware, cell data is extracted from that image using image analysis software. Single cell data or population data may be of interest, but for both, a series of steps is followed with varying degrees of user interaction depending on the application and the software being used. The first step is segmenting the cells in the image which provides the software algorithms with the information it needs for downstream processing of individual cell measurements. Next, a user must define the area(s) of interest based on a multitude of parameters, i.e., the area a user wants to measure. After the area of interest has been defined, measurements are collected. The measurements, oftentimes referred to as features, are dictated by the type of data desired from the sample. There are many mathematical algorithms powering all of these steps, and each image analysis software package provides its own level of openness to the mathematical algorithms being used. Data management Large numbers of images and amounts of data need to be managed when doing cellomics research. Data and image volumes can quickly range from 11MB to 1TB in less than a year, which is why cellomics uses the power of informatics to collect, organize, and archive all of this information. Secure and effective data mining requires the associated metadata to be captured and integrated into the data management model. Due to the critical nature of cellomics data management, implementing cellomics studies often requires inter-departmental cooperation between information technology and the life science research group leading the study.

It is composed of three villages: Lunca C√¢lnicului (Farkasv√°g√≥), Prejmer and Stupinii Prejmerului (Rohrau; M√©heskert). Located 18 km northeast of Bra»ôov, the Olt River passes through the commune. At the 2011 census, 90.7% of inhabitants were Romanians, 6.3% Roma, 1.9% Hungarians and 0.8% Germans. History The Teutonic Knights constructed the fortress Tartlau in 1212-1213 as part of their colonization of the Burzenland region. The town of Prejmer near the castle had begun development by 1225, and was the easternmost settlement of the Transylvanian Saxons. Prejmer was repeatedly invaded throughout the Middle Ages by various groups, including the Mongols, Tatars, Hungarians, Ottoman Turks, Cossacks, and Moldavians. However, the castle was only captured once, by Gabriel B√°thory in 1611. Most of Prejmer's German population fled the commune after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Prejmer is noted for its fortified church, one of the best preserved of its kind in Eastern Europe. Between 1962-1970, the Romanian government carefully restored it to its present condition; the restoration work was done under the direction of architect Mariana Angelescu and engineer Alexandru Dobriceanu. The church is modeled after churches of Jerusalem, as well as built in the style of Late Gothic churches from the Rhineland. In the 15th century, it was surrounded by a wall 12m high, forming a quadrilateral with rounded corners. The wall was reinforced by four horseshoe-shaped towers, two of which have since disappeared. The entrance--a vaulted gallery--is protected by a barbican and flanked by a lateral wall. The defensive structure is strengthened by embrasures and bret√®ches, while the covered way is surrounded by a parapet. The granaries and rooms that accommodated the villagers are arranged on four levels above the cellars.

The product The cheese is a blend of cream, milk and fresh and aged cheeses, particularly comt√©, which are pasteurized to stop the ripening process. Versatile and portable because of its pasteurization process, Laughing Cow can remain unrefrigerated for a limited length of time. The archetypal Laughing Cow cheese comes wrapped in the individual serving-sized foiled wedges, and they are packaged in a round, flat box. Consumers have to pull a little red thread around the box to open it, and the foil packaging also features a red tab for opening. The company was founded in 1921. The Laughing Cow is available in these formats in different worldwide markets: * Triangles, squares or rectangles in various flavours * Spreadable tubs * The Laughing Cow Dip & Crunch (or Pik & Croq in mainland Europe), previously named Cheez Dippers, which are snacks consisting of bread sticks and cheese spread, and these come in four varieties; original, light, hazelnut and pizza * Slicing blocks of The Laughing Cow with a harder consistency like that of butter * Ma P'tite Vache Qui Rit, pods of cheese spread to be eaten out of the pod with a spoon, especially for younger children * Toastinette processed cheese slices, similar to Kraft Singles * Bite-sized cubes, in various flavours and designed to be served as aperitifs at cocktail parties - which are called Cheez & Fun in many European countries, and also Snack Bites in the United Kingdom, Ap√©ricube in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, PartyCubes in Canada, Mini Cubes in Australia and New Zealand, and Belcube in Japan and South Korea. They are produced in 24- or 48-cube boxes of one flavour, e.g. blue, ham, salmon, chili pepper and olive, or they are produced in 24- or 48-cube boxes of a particular theme, e.g., 'Cocktails du Monde', 'Petites Recettes', 'Tex-Mex' and 'Indian'. Discontinued formats of The Laughing Cow include: * Giggles/Blop processed cheese pods for younger children * Squeezy bottles * Big Cheez Dipper (a larger version of Cheez Dippers) * Cheez Double Dippers (which contained crispy bacon flavour bits in addition to bread sticks and cheese spread). The Laughing Cow USA introduced a TV commercial in 2009 where the company introduced a new slogan, Have you laughed today? In 2010 they updated the brand's website to include cheese recipes. A wedge of Original Creamy Swiss Laughing Cow cheese is available in its original flavour, a light version with 7% fat, and an ultra- light version with 3% fat. In addition, flavoured versions of the cheese (such as ham, gruy√®re, garlic, paprika, mushroom, ch√®vre, bleu, hazelnut, pizza and onion) are also available in various markets worldwide. Evolution of the brand The Laughing Cow is red and white and jovial, and is almost always depicted wearing ear tags that look like the round boxes the cheese comes in (an example of the Droste effect). On April 16, 1921, L√©on Bel trademarked his brand, called La Vache qui rit, in France. In the trademark, the cow is said to have 'a hilarious expression'. Bel had made the original drawing himself, after seeing a travelling meat wagon during World War I called \\"La Wachkyrie\\", a play on the word for Valkyrie. In the beginning she was not laughing, she was not red and she did not wear ear tags. This patent was the very first branded cheese product registered in France. In 1924, illustrator Benjamin Rabier edited the drawing into something more like the image that prevails today. The blue and white stripes around the box date from 1955. Since 1976 both ear-tag boxes have been shown with the top-side visible. Before that year consumers were shown a top and bottom side. The current logo uses the Droste effect, with the laughing cow appearing inside the ear tags. Worldwide popularity It has long been popular in the United Kingdom and Canada as a children's snack. The cheese has also been a constant, but hardly popular, product in the United States for a number of years. However, demand for the triangular wedges has increased significantly recently, since the light version of the product was suggested as a viable menu item to followers of the South Beach Diet. The question asked by the French, \\"Pourquoi La Vache Qui Rit rit?\\" (\\"Why is The Laughing Cow laughing?\\") has become synonymous with the product. Groupe Bel announced on October 2, 2005, that they plan to open a 13 million Euro factory in Syria. This was the first such direct investment in that nation by a French food company.

Operation Malheur I On 29 April, COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland ordered the 1st Brigade commanded by Brigadier general Salve H. Matheson to immediately join Task Force Oregon in I Corps. In early May the brigade put ashore at Razorback Beach in southern Qu·∫£ng Ngai, established a base named Carentan, and prepared for action against the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN)/Viet Cong (VC)'s inland base areas-numbered 122, 123 and 124 which ran from north to south through the mountainous jungle overlooking the Ve and Tra Cau River Valleys. On 11 May, the 1st Brigade moved into the interior looking for the 1st and 2nd Regiments, both of which were thought to lurk there. Two of the three battalions conducted air assaults into the western part of Base Area 124, a tangle of tree-clad low hills overlooking the coastal plain. Resistance was light. The next morning Matheson committed his remaining battalion to a blocking position on high ground in the eastern part of the base area and ordered the other two battalions to sweep toward it. Encountering little opposition in the days that followed, Matheson decentralized his operations and conducted a more rigorous search. Matheson allowed each battalion commander to work his operational area as he saw fit, insisting only that companies operate within a two-hour march of each other. Most units kept constantly on the move and traveled with three to five days' worth of supplies, so the PAVN/VC would be less likely to pinpoint their location by observing resupply helicopters. Companies split into platoons for wider coverage of a search area, but remained close enough to reassemble quickly if they ran into a sizable force. These tactics often paid off. On 13 May, near the Tra Cau's headwaters, 12 separate firefights occurred, the largest against an entrenched VC company. By nightfall, the Americans had killed 29 VC at a cost of 1 American killed and 7 wounded, but the outcome was not always so one-sided. On 18 May Company B, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, moved well inside a large VC camp before realizing that the occupants had not yet fled. Confusion reigned during the firefight, and the Americans realized they were too close to their enemy to call in artillery or helicopter gunships. For six hours they fought, sometimes hand to hand, until reinforcements arrived and the VC pulled back. Left on the battlefield were 31 VC dead, while American casualties were 12 killed and 41 wounded. Matheson's men completed their scouring of Base Area 124 in early June, reporting that they had killed or captured over 400 VC, seized 125 weapons, and razed several base camps. Operation Malheur II Task Force Oregon commander General William B. Rosson then ordered Matheson to shift his attention slightly north, to Base Areas 123 and 122. Both were more mountainous than 124 and were often drenched by cloudbursts leftover from storms brewing around the inland peaks near the Laotian border. If Matheson failed to find VC there, he was to assist the Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i province chief with the evacuation of all civilians from the Ve and Tra Cau Valleys. Whatever their political loyalties, these civilians had provided food and recruits for the VC. Matheson sent two battalions into Base Area 123 on 8 June and another into 122 the following day. While the first day's fighting ended with 22 VC killed, it was apparent to the Americans that the VC were trying to avoid contact. With few enemy units to be found, Matheson turned to evacuating civilians. For two weeks trucks and helicopters moved over 7,000 people and 1,200 head of cattle to refugee centers in ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï and Nghƒ©a H√†nh Districts. When the operation ended in late June, the valleys had been laid waste by combat and herbicides, while several hundred tons of rice and salt were either destroyed or airlifted to refugee centers. In July, believing that the VC were re-forming in Base Area 124, the airborne brigade returned south. A week of searching, however, uncovered only small enemy units. Documents and prisoners revealed that both the 1st and 2nd Regiments had lost several commanders and that illness, desertions and heavy casualties had greatly diminished their effectiveness. When Matheson received a report in mid-July that the two units were converging on Base Area 123 to form a single combat-effective regiment, he called in B-52s. On the heels of the bombing, all three of his battalions air-assaulted back into the region, which they again swept clean through the rest of the month. Yet, once again, the VC evaded, though American sweeps killed over 100 VC, including a VC district chief and his aides. Aftermath When the operations closed, the 1st Brigade reported 869 VC and PAVN killed and 314 weapons captured, for the loss of 81 US killed.

There are no higher mountains in New Mexico south of Santa Fe Baldy. It is prominent as seen from Los Alamos and communities along the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico, but is relatively inconspicuous from Santa Fe, as its north-south trending main ridge line is seen nearly end-on, disguising the size of the mountain. Tree line in the Sangre de Cristos is unusually high (exceeding in places) and only the top of the mountain is perpetually free of trees, but several severe forest fires have created bare spots extending to lower elevations. An extensive region of aspen trees on its flanks produces spectacular orange-yellow coloration during the fall that is the subject of many photographic studies. Santa Fe Baldy rises in the Pecos Wilderness within the Santa Fe National Forest, on the water divide between the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. The western slopes are drained by the Rio Capulin and the Rio Nambe, both flowing to the Rio Grande. The eastern side of the mountain consists of two small cirques, one containing Lake Katherine, one of the highest lakes in New Mexico at elevation . Contrary to popular belief, Lake Katherine was not given its name by theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, in reference to his wife Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Oppenheimer. This naming convention predates their meeting by at least a decade, and the lake is instead named after Katherine Chaves Page Kavanaugh, owner of the Los Pinos Guest Ranch on the Pecos River. The attribution of the name to J. Robert Oppenheimer may be influenced by his known connection to Katherine Chaves Page Kavanaugh, as he was a frequent guest at the Ranch. The peak is accessed by Trail 251, the Skyline Trail, which climbs to a saddle about below the summit; the remaining distance is covered by a steep unofficial trail along the ridgeline. Under good conditions the summit is a simple \\"walk-up\\" climb, but the Sangre de Cristos are unusually prone to lightning, and during the summer months, the wise hiker is off Santa Fe Baldy and other high summits in the range by noon, to avoid afternoon thunderstorms. Nearby peaks include Lake Peak, and Tesuque Peak, , both located about to the south of Santa Fe Baldy. Santa Fe Ski Basin is on the western slopes of Tesuque Peak. On 11 June 2009, Santa Fe Baldy was the scene of a helicopter accident that claimed the life of New Mexico State Police Sergeant Andrew Tingwall and University of New Mexico graduate student Megumi Yamamoto. The helicopter crashed after Tingwall rescued Yamamoto. Yamamoto had been hiking with her boyfriend, but had become lost. {  With fresh snow, January 2010  From Truchas Peak, with Pecos Baldy in the foreground }  References   External links  Category:Mountains of New Mexico Category:Sangre de Cristo Mountains Baldy Category:Santa Fe National Forest Category:Mountains of Santa Fe County, New Mexico ","title":"Santa Fe Baldy"},{"id":"2164233","text":"Stanis≈Çaw Wigura (9 April 1901 ‚Äì 11 September 1932) was a Polish aircraft designer and aviator, co-founder of the RWD aircraft construction team and lecturer at the Warsaw University of Technology. Along with Franciszek ≈ªwirko, he won the international air contest Challenge 1932. He was born in Warsaw. In his youth he was interested in mechanics and aviation, and he was also a Boy Scout. In 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, he volunteered for the 8th Field Artillery Regiment. In 1921, he started studies at Warsaw University of Technology (Warsaw Tech), where he met Stanislaw Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki. He was one of founders of the Aviation Section of Students' Mechanical Club. In December 1925, students of the Section founded their own workshop, where they built aircraft. In 1926, Wigura and Rogalski designed their first light aircraft WR-1, built in 1927. In 1927, three designers: Rogalski, Wigura, and Drzewiecki started working together, creating the RWD team (it was an acronym of their names). Wigura's task was for all the initial design calculations and development. In 1928, they built their first sportsplane RWD-1. In 1929, Wigura graduated from Warsaw Tech, receiving the Engineer title. In the same year, he completed a pilot course in the Academic Aeroclub. The RWD team began constructing more successful aircraft - sportsplane RWD-2 of 1929 (4 built) and the bigger RWD-4 of 1930 (9 built). They were used in Polish sports aviation, with some success. Wigura himself became active in sports aviation. It was thanks to his friendship with 8-years-older pilot Franciszek ≈ªwirko, assigned by the military as a liaison officer in the Aeroclub. They often flew together, Wigura as a mechanic and second pilot. Between August 9 and September 6, 1929, ≈ªwirko and Wigura flew on the RWD-2 prototype across Europe, on a Warsaw-Paris-Barcelona-Milano- Warsaw route of 5,000 kilometers. On October 6 they won a Polish air race. In July 1930, ≈ªwirko and Wigura took part in the International Tourist Plane Competition (Challenge 1930), flying the RWD-4, but they had to withdraw on July 25 due to engine failure after a compulsory landing in Spain. During September and October 1930, they won in two Polish contests, flying on RWD-2 and RWD-4, and in September 1931, they won another one, flying on a prototype RWD-5. In a meantime, Wigura with others designed further aircraft: liaison plane RWD-3 in 1930 (one built), record sportsplane RWD-7 in 1931, and a sportsplane RWD-5 in 1931. The latter was made famous as the lightest plane that made a transatlantic flight (20 built). He also started designing the RWD-8 basic trainer. In 1932, he developed a modern sportsplane, the RWD-6, that was intended for the International Tourist Plane Competition (Challenge 1932), which took place between August 20‚Äì28, 1932. ≈ªwirko, intended as a pilot, chose Wigura as his crewmate. They won a competition, over the heavily favored German and other teams, and both became heroes in Poland. The success was brought by ≈ªwirko's piloting skills and the high quality and performance of the plane.\\"Challenge 1932\\" Heinkel 64, undated, retrieved on 2008-07-06. On 11 September 1932, while flying to an air meet in Prague, ≈ªwirko and Wigura fatally crashed in their RWD-6 in the forest in Cierlicko near Cieszyn, when the wing broke in a heavy storm. Honours and awards Stanislaw Wigura was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Polish Gold Cross of Merit.

It was produced by Hanna-Barbera and first aired on Tuesday, October 30, 1979 on NBC. In addition to the regular Flintstones voice cast, John Stephenson played Count Rockula, and Ted Cassidy voiced Frankenstone. Plot When Fred wins the big prize on the \\"Make A Deal or Don't\\" game show, he and Wilma plan a vacation with Barney and Betty to Count Rockula's spooky castle in Rocksylvania which has now been turned into a tourist resort. Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag. Rockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook. Unbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \\"the real truth about married life\\". Rockula and Frankenstone *Count Rockula: a campy and not-so-bloodthirsty vampire with a lust for women and a fear of werewolves, prompting him to build a Frankenstone monster to keep them away. Having been asleep for five hundred years, Rockula is awoken by Frankenstone and sets out to clear his castle of the guests and take Wilma, whom he thinks is his bride, for himself, even if it means killing Fred. Count Rockula also appears in the episodes \\"Blood Brothers\\" and \\"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\\" of The New Fred and Barney Show, again voiced by Stephenson, albeit in a completely different continuity because Rockula then has a bride, slightly different garments, and a pet werewolf despite having a fear for them in this movie. *Frankenstone: Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's lab. His only mission in life is to carry out Rockula's orders, primarily to keep werewolves away from Rockula, although his low IQ often leads him to find difficulty in accomplishing even the simplest of tasks (in one particular scene, Frankenstone is ordered to search some barrels for Fred, and fails to notice Fred crouching right beside him). Despite the resemblance, he is not to be confused with the Frank Frankenstone character that first appeared in the episode \\"Fred & Barney Meet the Frankenstones\\" of The New Fred and Barney Show, the TV special The Flintstones' New Neighbors or The Flintstone Comedy Show. Frankenstone was one of Ted Cassidy's final roles; the actor, who was already famous for playing Frankenstein's monster-like roles due to his height (most notably Lurch on The Addams Family and several other productions), died ten months before the special was released.

McConnell is best known for establishing and leading the big band The Boss Brass, which he directed from 1967 to 1999. Biography McConnell was born in London, Ontario and took up the valve trombone in high school. He began his performing career in the early 1950s, performing and studying with Clifford Brown,Clifford Brown and a 20 year-old Rob McConnell played a jam session in Quebec City on June 28th, 1955. Six cuts can be found on Clifford Brown, \\"Complete Quebec City Jam Session,\\" released on audio CD in 2009. Around the same time, Brown apparently made a home recording of \\"Strike up the Band\\" with McConnell of but this recording, while shared on the internet, has not been released commercially. Don Thompson, Bobby Gimby, and later with Canadian trumpeter Maynard Ferguson. He studied music theory with Gordon Delamont. In 1968 he formed The Boss Brass, a big band that became his primary performing and recording unit through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\\"Boss Brass founder Rob McConnell dies at 75\\". CBC Arts, May 03, 2010 McConnell assembled the original Boss Brass from Toronto studio musicians. The instrumentation of the band was originally sixteen pieces, consisting of trumpets, trombones, French horns, and a rhythm section but no saxophones. He introduced a saxophone section in 1970 and expanded the trumpet section to include a fifth trumpet in 1976, bringing the total to twenty-two members. In 1977 McConnell recorded a double LP called 'Big Band Jazz'. This was a 'direct cut' LP using Direct-to-disc recording. A small number of albums which recorded direct-to-disc began to appear on the market in the late 1970s and were marketed as \\"audiophile\\" editions, promising superior sound quality compared with recordings made using the more common multi-track tape recording methods. On McConnell's direct cut double LP, an entire side (15 minutes and 2 seconds) was devoted to a version of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. The double album won the Juno Award for Best Jazz Album in 1978. His 1983 his All in Good Time album won the Grammy for Best Large Jazz Ensemble recording. In 1988, McConnell took a teaching position at the Dick Grove School of Music in California but gave up his position and returned to Canada a year later. In 1992 he was presented with a SOCAN jazz award. In 1997, he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and in 1998 was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He remained active throughout the 2000s, touring internationally as both a performer and educator, running music clinics around the world and performing as a leader and guest artist. The Rob McConnell Tentet, a scaled- down version of the Boss Brass featuring many Boss Brass alumni, recorded three albums, The Rob McConnell Tentet (2000), Thank You, Ted (2002), and Music of the Twenties (2003).

The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de B√©xar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war ‚Äî but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's force. The towns of Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned to keep them out of the hands of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on executing members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco. Prelude =Changes in Mexico: 1834 ‚Äì 1835= In 1834, Mexican president Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna shifted from a Federalist political ideology to creating a Centralist government and revoked the country's Constitution of 1824. That constitution had not only established Coahuila y Tejas as a new Mexican state, but had also provided for each state in Mexico to create its own local-level constitution.; Haley (2002), p. 116. After eliminating state-level governments Santa Anna had in effect created a dictatorship and put Coahuila y Tejas under the military rule of General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos.Davis (2004), p. 143; Todish et al. (1998), p. 121. When Santa Anna made Miguel Barrag√°n temporary president, he also had Barrag√°n install him as head of the Mexican Army of Operations.Davis (2004), p. 200. Intending to put down all rebellion in Coahuila y Tejas, he began amassing his army on November 28, 1835, Todish et al. (1998), p. 125. soon followed by General Joaqu√≠n Ram√≠rez y Sesma leading the Vanguard of the Advance across the Rio Grande in December.Todish et al.

Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urgingTodish et al. (1998), p. 23. the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitutionTodish et al. (1998), p. 24. established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia.Haley (2002), p. 116. Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region.Lack (1992), p. 76. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20. Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.Todish et al. (1998), p.126; The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.Hardin (1994), p. 161. The following day, the 59 delegates created the Republic of Texas by affixing their signatures to the Texas Declaration of Independence.Hardin (1994), p. 161; Lack (1992), p. 83. Houston's military authority was expanded on March 4, to include \\"the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.\\"Hatch (1999), p. 188; The delegates elected the Republic's ad interim government on March 16, with David G. Burnet as president, Lorenzo de Zavala as vice president, Samuel P. Carson as secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson Rusk as secretary of war, Bailey Hardeman as secretary of the treasury, Robert Potter as secretary of the navy, and David Thomas as attorney general.Lack (1992), p. 77. Battle of Gonzales: October 2, 1835 alt=Battle of Gonzales cannon The Battle of Gonzales was the onset of a chain of events that led to what is known as the Runaway Scrape. The confrontation began in September 1835, when the Mexican government attempted to reclaim a bronze cannon that it had provided to Gonzales in 1831 to protect the town against Indian attacks. The first attempt by Corporal Casimiro De Le√≥n resulted in De Le√≥n's detachment being taken prisoners, and the cannon being buried in a peach orchard. James C. Neill, a veteran who had served at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend under Andrew Jackson, was put in charge of the artillery after it was later dug up and wheel mounted. When Lieutenant Francisco de Casta√±eda arrived accompanied by 100 soldiers and made a second attempt at repossessing the cannon, Texians dared the Mexicans to \\"come and take it\\". John Henry Moore led 150 Texian militia on October 2 in successfully repelling the Mexican troops. A \\"Come and Take It\\" flag was later fashioned by the women of Gonzales. The cannon was moved to San Antonio de B√©xar and became one of the artillery pieces used by the defenders of the Alamo. The immediate result of the Texian victory at Gonzales was that two days later the number of volunteers had swelled to over 300, and they were determined to drive the Mexican army out of Texas.Davis (2004), pp. 142‚Äì145. Simultaneously, a company of volunteers under George M. Collinsworth captured the Presidio La Bah√≠a from the Mexicans on October 9 at the Battle of Goliad.Davis (2004), p. 147. The Mexican government's response to the unrest in Texas was an October 30 authorization of war.Todish et al. (1998), p. 124. On the banks of the Nueces River from San Patricio on November 4 during the Battle of Lipantitl√°n, volunteers under Ira Westover captured the fort from Mexican troops. B√©xar: 1835 ‚Äì 1836 =Siege of B√©xar and its aftermath: October 1835 ‚Äì February 1836= By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de B√©xar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepci√≥n on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle.Davis (2004), pp. 157‚Äì159; Austin continued to send troops to B√©xar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander.; On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of B√©xar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Davis (2004), pp. 182‚Äì185. Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at B√©xar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources.Todish et al. (1998), p. 29, 125. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution.Davis (2004), pp. 75, 186‚Äì187; When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General Jos√© de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast.Todish et al. (1998), pp. 126‚Äì127. About north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner.Todish et al. (1998), p. 128; Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 372. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition led by Grant, killing all but 11, six of whom were taken prisoner. Five of the men escaped the Battle of Agua Dulce and joined Fannin who wanted to increase the defense force at Goliad.; =The Alamo: February 1836= Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of B√©xar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city.Todish et al. (1998), pp. 29, 125. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed B√©xar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command.Todish et al. (1998), p.126; Moore (2004), p. 39. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Segu√≠n left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements.Todish et al. (1998), p. 43; Moore (2004), p. 28. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.Poyo (1996), p. 53, 58 \\"Efficient in the Cause\\" (Stephen L. Harden); Lindley (2003), p. 94, 134. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29. Fall of the Alamo, and the runaway flight: March ‚Äì April 1836 =Houston begins forming his army= As the closest settlement to San Antonio de B√©xar, Gonzales was the rallying point for volunteers who responded to both the Travis letter from the Alamo and Houston's recruitment pleas. Recently formed groups came from Austin and Washington counties and from the Colorado River area.Moore (2004), pp. 22‚Äì24, 51. Volunteers from Brazoria, Fort Bend and Matagorda counties organized after arriving in Gonzales.Moore (2004), pp. 49, 51. The Kentucky Rifle company under Newport, Kentucky business man Sidney Sherman had been aided by funding from Cincinnati, Ohio residents.; Moore (2004), pp. 24‚Äì27, 51. Alamo commandant Neill was in Gonzales purchasing supplies and recruiting reinforcements on March 6, unaware that the Alamo had fallen to Mexican forces that morning. When Seguin learned en route that Fannin would be unable to reach the Alamo in time,Moore (2004), p. 28. he immediately began mustering an all-Tejano company of scouts.Moore (2004), pp. 28‚Äì29, 51. His men combined with Lieutenant William Smith's and volunteered to accompany Neill's recruits. They encountered the Mexican army from the Alamo on March 7, and Neill's men turned back while the Seguin-Smith scouts moved forward.Moore (2004), pp. 39‚Äì40. As the scouts neared the Alamo, they heard only silence.Moore (2004), pp. 39‚Äì43, 46, 51. Andrew Barcena and Anselmo Bergara from Seguin's other detachment inside the Alamo showed up in Gonzales on March 11, telling of their escape and delivering news of the March 6 slaughter. Their stories were discounted; Houston, who had arrived that same day, denounced them as Mexican spies.Moore (2004), pp. 45‚Äì46, 163, 171. Smith and Seguin confirmed the fate of the Alamo upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up the Presidio La Bah√≠a fortress, and retreat to Victoria,Moore (2004), pp. 46‚Äì47. but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.Moore (2004), p. 47, 67. Houston promptly began organizing the troops at Gonzales into the First Regiment under Burleson who had arrived as part of the Mina volunteers.Moore (2004), pp. 19‚Äì22, 51. A second regiment would later be formed when the army grew large enough.Moore (2004), p. 48. As others began to arrive, individual volunteers not already in another company were put under Captain William Hestor Patton.Moore (2004), pp. 51‚Äì52. Houston had 374 volunteers and their commanders in Gonzales on March 12.Moore (2004), p. 51. Santa Anna sent Susanna Dickinson with her infant daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook Ben to Gonzales, with dispatches written in English by Almonte to spread the news of the fall of the Alamo.Moore (2004), pp. 37‚Äì38. Scouts Deaf Smith, Henry Karnes and Robert Eden Handy encountered the survivors outside of Gonzales on March 13. When Karnes returned with the news, almost immediately 25 volunteers deserted. Wailing filled the air when Dickinson and the others reached the town with their first-hand accounts.; Moore (2004), pp. 55‚Äì56. alt=The Sam Houston Oak where the Provisional Army of Texas rested after the burning of Gonzales Although civilian evacuations had begun in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de B√©xar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to a safe place to train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately.Hardin, McBride (2001), p. 9. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position ‚Äì the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.Hardin (1994), p. 179. =The burning of Gonzales= Houston called for a Council of War. The officers voted that the families should be ordered to leave, and the troops would cover the retreat. By midnight, less than an hour after Dickinson had arrived, the combined army and civilian population began a frantic move eastward, leaving behind everything they could not immediately grab and transport. Much of the provisions and artillery were left behind, including two 24-pounder cannons.Moore (2004), pp. 57‚Äì60; Hardin, McBride (2001), p. 9. Houston ordered Salvador Flores along with a company of Juan Seguin's men to form the rear guard to protect the fleeing families. Couriers were sent to other towns in Texas to warn that the Mexican army was advancing.Moore (2004), p. 60. The retreat took place so quickly that many of the Texian scouts did not fully comprehend it until after the town was evacuated.Moore (2004), p. 58. Houston ordered Karnes to burn the town and everything in it so nothing would remain to benefit the Mexican troops. By dawn, the entire town was in ashes or flames.Moore (2004), p. 59. Volunteers from San Felipe de Austin who had been organized under Captain John Bird on March 5 to reinforce the men at the AlamoMoore (2004), pp. 61‚Äì63. had been en route to San Antonio de B√©xar on March 13 when approximately east of Gonzales they encountered fleeing citizens and a courier from Sam Houston. Told of the Alamo's fall, Bird's men offered assistance to the fleeing citizens and joined Houston's army at Bartholomew D. McClure's plantation on the evening of March 14. At Washington-on-the-Brazos, the delegates to the convention learned of the Alamo's fall on March 13.Davis (2004), p. 241. The Republic's new ad interim government was sworn in on March 17, with a department overseeing military spy operations, and adjourned the same day.Moore (2004), pp. 77‚Äì79. The government then fled to Groce's Landing where they stayed for several days before moving on to Harrisburg on March 21 where they established temporary headquarters in the home of widow Jane Birdsall Harris.; Todish et al. (1998), p. 103; Moore (2004), p. 139. King's men at Refugio had taken refuge in Mission Nuestra Se√±ora de la Rosario when they were subsequently attacked by Urrea's forces. Fannin sent 120 reinforcements under William Ward, but the March 14 Battle of Refugio cost 15 Texian lives.Todish et al. (1998), p. 129. Ward's men escaped, but King's men were captured and executed on March 16.Moore (2004), p. 68 =Colorado River crossings= Burnam's Upon learning of the flight, Santa Anna sent General Joaqu√≠n Ram√≠rez y Sesma with 700 men to pursue Houston, and 600 men under General Eugenio Tolsa as reinforcements. Finding only burned remains at Gonzales, Sesma marched his army toward the Colorado River.Moore (2004), pp. 71‚Äì72. The Texian army camped March 15‚Äì18 on the Lavaca River property of Williamson DanielsMoore (2004), p. 66; where they were joined by combined forces under Joe Bennett and Captain Peyton R. Splane.Moore (2004), pp. 69‚Äì73. Fleeing civilians accompanied Houston's army turning north at the Navidad River as they crossed to the east side of the Colorado River at Burnam's Crossing.Moore (2004), pp. 75‚Äì76, 83; The ferry and trading post, as well as the family home of Jesse Burnam, were all burned at Houston's orders on March 17 to prevent Santa Anna's army from making the same crossing. Beason's and DeWees alt=Campaigns of the Texas Revolution Beason's Crossing was located where Columbus is today. DeWees Crossing was north of Beason's. From March 19 through March 26, Houston split his forces between the two crossings.Moore (2004), pp. 90, 94‚Äì95. Additional Texian volunteer companies began arriving at both crossings, including three companies of Texas Rangers, the Liberty County Volunteers and the Nacogdoches Volunteers.Moore (2004), pp. 90, 97, 99‚Äì103, 118‚Äì120, 126. Sesma's battalion of approximately 725 men and artillery camped on the opposite side of the Colorado, at a distance halfway between the two Texian camps.Moore (2004), pp. 94, 95. To prevent Sesma's troops from using the William DeWees log cabin, Sherman ordered it burned.Moore (2004), pp. 98‚Äì99. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued for an attack on Sesma's troops, Houston was not ready.Moore (2004), pp. 107, 111. Fannin had begun evacuating Presidio La Bah√≠a on March 19. The estimated 320 troops were low on food and water, and the breakdown of a wagon allowed Urrea's men to overtake them at Coleto Creek, ending in Fannin's surrender on March 20.; Todish et al. (1998), p.130. Peter Kerr, who had served with Fannin and claimed to have been held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender,Moore (2004), p. 147. but would later claim to have uncovered evidence that Kerr was a spy for the Mexicans.Moore (2004), pp. 114, 144, 171. The Texian army was a force of 810 volunteers and staff at this point,Moore (2004), p. 100 but few had any military training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were not yet ready to engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection.Moore (2004), pp. 126‚Äì130. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26.Moore (2004), pp. 114‚Äì118. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just on the other side of the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.Moore (2004), pp. 117‚Äì118. =Brazos River training camp=  Groce's Landing  Texian survivors of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection was an act of piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27.Haley (2002), p. 130. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a pyre.Moore (2004), pp. 128‚Äì133. It would be a week before word of the Goliad massacre reached Sam Houston. The retreating Texian army stopped at San Felipe de AustinMoore (2004), p. 128. on March 28‚Äì29 to stock up on food and supplies.Moore (2004), pp. 135‚Äì136. Houston's plan to move the army north to Groce's Landing on the Brazos River was met with resistance from captains Wyly Martin and Moseley Baker, whose units balked at further retreat. Houston reassigned Martin south to protect the Morton Ferry crossing at Fort Bend, and Baker was ordered to guard the river crossing at San Felipe de Austin.Moore (2004), pp. 136‚Äì137. News of approaching Mexican troops and Houston's retreat caused panic among the population in the counties of Washington, Sabine, Shelby and San Augustine. Amid the confusion of fleeing residents of those counties, two volunteer groups under captains William Kimbro and Benjamin Bryant arrived to join Houston on March 29. Kimbro was ordered to San Felipe de Austin to reinforce Baker's troops, while Bryant's men remained with the main army.Moore (2004), pp. 145‚Äì146, 163‚Äì164. After an erroneous scouting report of approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin to the ground on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it.Moore (2004), pp. 140‚Äì141. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property to keep it out of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east. During a two-week period beginning March 31, the Texian army camped on the west side of the Brazos River in Austin County, near Groce's Landing (also known as Groce's Ferry). As Houston led his army north towards the landing, the unrelenting rainy weather swelled the Brazos and threatened flooding.Moore (2004), p. 162. Groce's was transformed into a training camp for the troops.Moore (2004), pp. 151‚Äì152. Major Edwin Morehouse arrived with a New York battalion of recruits who were immediately assigned to assist Wyly Martin at Fort Bend.; Moore (2004), p. 157. Civilian men who were fleeing the Mexicans enlisted at Groce's,Moore (2004), pp.147‚Äì148. and displaced civilian women in the camp helped the army's efforts by sewing shirts for the soldiers.Moore (2004), p. 149. Samuel G. Hardaway, a survivor of Major William Ward's group who had escaped the Battle of Refugio and re-joined Fannin at the Battle of Coleto, also managed to escape the Goliad massacre. As he fled Goliad, he was eventually joined by three other survivors, Joseph Andrews, James P. Trezevant and M. K. Moses. Spies for the Texian army discovered the four men and took them to Baker's camp near San Felipe de Austin on April 2.Moore (2004), pp. 157‚Äì158. Several other survivors of the Goliad massacre were found on April 10 by Texian spies. Survivors Daniel Murphy, Thomas Kemp, Charles Shain, David Jones, William Brenan and Nat Hazen were taken to Houston at Groce's Landing where they enlisted to fight with Houston's army.Moore (2004), pp. 194‚Äì195. Houston learned of the Goliad massacre on April 3. Unaware that Secretary of War Rusk was already en route to Groce's with orders from President Burnet to halt the army's retreat and engage the enemy, he relayed the Goliad news by letter to Rusk.; Moore (2004), pp. 165, 167,169. Empowered to remove Houston from command and take over the army himself, Rusk instead assessed Houston's plan of action as correct, after witnessing the training at Groce's. Rusk and Houston formed the Second Regiment on April 8 to serve under Sherman, with Burleson retaining command of the First Regiment. Yellowstone steamboat The steamboat Yellowstone under the command of Captain John Eautaw Ross was impressed into service for the Provisional Army of Texas on April 2, and initially ferried patients across the Brazos River when Dr. James Aeneas Phelps established a field hospital at Bernardo Plantation.Moore (2004), p. 156. Three days later, Santa Anna joined with Sesma's troops,Moore (2004), p. 176. and had them build flatboats to cross the Brazos as the Mexicans sought to overtake and defeat the Texians.Moore (2004), pp. 179,181. Wyly Martin reported on April 8 that Mexican forces had divided and were headed both east to Nacogdoches and southeast to Matagorda.Moore (2004), p. 182. Houston reinforced Baker's post at San Felipe de Austin on April 9,Moore (2004), p. 186. as Santa Anna continued moving southeast on April 10.Moore (2004), pp. 186‚Äì187. The Texian army was transported by the Yellowstone over to the east side of the Brazos on April 12, where they set up camp at the Bernardo Plantation.Moore (2004), pp. 198‚Äì200. After walking from Harrisburg, future president of the Republic Mirabeau B. Lamar arrived at Bernardo to enlist as a private in Houston's army and suggested using the steamer for guerilla warfare.Moore (2004), pp. 203‚Äì204; With Baker guarding the crossing at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin guarding the Morton Ferry crossing at Ford Bend, Santa Anna opted on April 12 to cross the Brazos halfway between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and artillery crossing over the next day.Moore (2004), pp. 206‚Äì207. The Mexican army attacked the steamer numerous times in an attempt to capture it, but Ross successfully used cotton bales to protect the steamer and its cargo, and was able to keep the Yellowstone away from Mexican control. Houston released the steamboat from service on April 14, and it continued to Galveston.Moore (2004), p. 212. =Burning of Harrisburg and the crucial crossroads= The ad interim government departed Harrisburg on the steamboat Cayuga for New Washington ahead of Santa Anna's April 15 arrival,Moore (2004), p. 207. thwarting his plans to eliminate the entire government of the Republic of Texas.Moore (2004), pp. 195‚Äì197, 207. Three printers still at work on the Telegraph and Texas Register told the Mexican army that everyone in the government had already left, and Santa Anna responded by having the printers arrested and the printing presses tossed into Buffalo Bayou.Moore (2004), pp. 219‚Äì220; Fischer (1976), p. 88. After days of looting and seeking out information about the government, Santa Anna ordered the town burned on April 18.Davis (2004), pp. 264‚Äì165. He later tried to place the blame for the destruction on Houston.Moore (2004), pp. 218‚Äì219, 232‚Äì233; Todish et al. (1998), p.130. Twin Sisters cannons at San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Sitealt=Replicas of the Twin Sisters cannons at San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site Before the Texian army left Bernardo Plantation, they welcomed the arrival of two cannons cast in November 1835 by Greenwood and Webb in Cincinnati, Ohio, funded entirely by the people of that city as a donation to the Texas Revolution. The idea had arisen as a suggestion from Robert F. Lytle, one of the businessmen who helped fund Sherman's Kentucky Riflemen.Moore (2004), pp. 15, 152‚Äì153. Arriving in New Orleans after a lengthy trip from Ohio on the Mississippi River, the cannons were transported to the Gulf Coast aboard the Pennsylvania schooner. The cannons were nicknamed the \\"Twin Sisters\\", perhaps in honor of the twins Elizabeth and Eleanor Rice traveling aboard the Pennsylvania, who were to present the cannons upon their arrival at Galveston in April 1836.Moore (2004), p. 185; Haley (2002), p. 137. At Galveston, Leander Smith had the responsibility of transporting the cannons from Harrisburg to Bernardo Plantation in Waller County. Along the way, Smith recruited 35 men into the army.Moore (2004), pp. 171‚Äì173, 201‚Äì202. Lieutenant Colonel James Neill was put in charge of the cannons once they arrived in camp.Moore (2004), pp. 212‚Äì213. Martin and Baker abandoned the river crossings on April 14 and re- joined Houston's army which had marched from Bernardo to the Charles Donoho Plantation near present-day Hempstead in Waller County.Moore (2004), p. 214; As news spread of the Mexican army's movements, residents of Nacogdoches and San Augustine began to flee east towards the Sabine River. After refusals to continue with the army, Martin was ordered by Houston to accompany displaced families on their flight eastward. Hundreds of soldiers left the army to help their families. The main army parted from the refugees at this point, and acting Secretary of War David Thomas advised Houston to move southward to secure Galveston Bay.Moore (2004), pp. 215‚Äì217. Houston, however, was getting conflicting advice from the cabinet members. President Burnet had sent Secretary of State Carson to Louisiana in hopes of getting the United States army and individual state militias involved in the Texas fight for independence. While he attempted to secure such involvement, Carson sent a dispatch to Houston on April 14 advising him to retreat all the way to the Louisiana-Texas border on the Sabine River, and bide his time before engaging the Mexican army.Moore (2004), pp. 211‚Äì212. The Texian army camped west of present-day Tomball on April 15, at Sam McCarley's homestead.; Moore (2004), pp. 220‚Äì221. They departed the next morningMoore (2004), p. 222. and east reached a crucial crossroads. One road led east to Nacogdoches and eventually the Sabine River and Louisiana, while the other road led southeast to Harrisburg. The army was concerned that Houston would continue the eastward retreat. Although Houston discussed his decision with no one, he led the army down the southeast road. Rusk ordered that a small group of volunteers be split from the army to secure Robbins's Ferry on the Trinity River.; Moore (2004), pp. 226‚Äì227. Houston's troops stopped overnight on April 16 at the home of Matthew Burnet, and the next morning continued marching towards Harrisburg, southeast.; Moore (2004), p. 229. With the refugee families being accorded a military escort eastward and Houston marching southeast, the retreat of the Provisional Army of Texas was over. On the march which would lead to San Jacinto, moving the heavy artillery across rain-soaked terrain slowed down the army's progress. The army had previously been assisted in moving the Twin Sisters with oxen borrowed from refugee Pamela Mann when she believed the army was fleeing towards Nacogdoches. When she learned the army was headed towards Harrisburg and a confrontation with the Mexican army, she reclaimed her oxen.Moore (2004), pp. 227‚Äì228. The Texian army had expanded to twenty-six companies by the time they reached Harrisburg on April 18 and saw the destruction Santa Anna had left behind.Moore (2004), pp. 233‚Äì235, 243. =New Washington= On orders of Santa Anna after the burning of Harrisburg, Almonte went in pursuit of the ad interim government at New Washington. During their flight the Republic officials switched from steamer to ferry to skiff. On the final leg of the trip, Almonte finally had them in his sights, but refused to fire after he saw Mrs. Burnet and her children on the skiff.Moore (2004), pp. 230‚Äì232. In addition to letting the government get away one more time, Almonte's spies had misread Houston's troop movements and Santa Anna was told that the Texian army was still retreating eastward, this time through Lynchburg.Moore (2004), p. 230; New Washington was looted and burned on April 20 by Mexican troops,Moore (2004), pp. 235‚Äì237. and as many as 5,000 civilians fled, either by boat or across land. Those attempting to cross the San Jacinto River were bottlenecked for three days, and the vicinity around the crossing transformed into a refugee camp. Burnet ordered government assistance all across Texas for fleeing families. Aftermath In a troop movement that took all night on a makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness.Moore (2004), pp. 242, 295‚Äì296; ; Moore (2004), p. 251. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill was adamant that the cannons be taken into the battle.Moore (2004), p. 246. In an April 20 skirmish the day before the main battle Neill was severely wounded,Moore (2004), pp. 264, 267. and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery.Moore (2004), p. 295. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength on the day of the main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.Moore (2004), p. 298; Todish et al. (1998), p. 131. The Texians attacked in the afternoon of April 21 while Santa Anna was still under the misconception that Houston was actually retreating.Moore (2004), p. 230. He had allowed his army time to relax and feed their horses, while he took a nap.Moore (2004), pp. 328‚Äì329. When he was awakened by the attack, he immediately fled on horseback, but was later captured when Sergeant James Austin Sylvester found him hiding in the grass.Moore (2004), pp. 337,353,377. Houston's own account was that the battle lasted \\"about eighteen minutes\\", before apprehending prisoners and confiscating armaments.Moore (2004), pp. 344‚Äì345. When the Twin Sisters went up against the Mexican army's Golden Standard cannon, they performed so well that Hockley's unit was able to capture the Mexican cannon. The Yellowstone saw war service for the Republic one more time on May 7, when it transported Houston and his prisoner Santa Anna, along with the government Santa Anna tried to extinguish, to Galveston Island. From there, the government and Santa Anna traveled to Velasco for the signing of the treaties.Moore (2004), pp. 375‚Äì386,405‚Äì407. Houston had suffered a serious wound during the battle,Moore (2004), pp. 338‚Äì339. and on May 28 boarded the schooner Flora for medical treatment in New Orleans.Moore (2004), p. 407. Not until news of the victory at San Jacinto spread did the refugees return to their homesteads and businesses, or whatever was left after the destruction caused by both armies. Throughout Texas, possessions had been abandoned and later looted. Businesses, homes and farms were wiped out by the devastation of war. Often there was nothing left to go back to, but those who went home began to pick up their lives and move forward. San Felipe de Austin never really recovered from its total destruction. The few people who returned there moved elsewhere, sooner or later. Secretary of War Rusk would later commend the women of Texas who held their families together during the flight, while their men volunteered to fight: \\"The men of Texas deserve much credit, but more was due the women.

She was described by Elias Owen as the \\"Freckled Cow\\". In his essay on folklore, written originally for the national eisteddfod of 1887 and subsequently republished, he recorded a story from Denbighshire of a cow which was said to give milk to \\"any one ... in want of milk\\" until a witch milked the cow dry. The cow then left, plunging into a lake near Cerrig-y-drudion, and leading her two children, long-horned oxen (which are themselves the subject of other legends), after her. Owen also quoted an earlier author on the matter of another Buwch Frech. This author translated it as a Dun Cow, and wrote that a bone said to belong to it was to be found in Gwydir near Llanrwst. Owen observed that \\"we have in these places conflicting conditions, which I will not endeavour to reconcile\\". The idea of fairy cows with abundant milk which came from and returned to lakes occurs across Wales: Robin Gwyndaf of the Museum of Welsh Life lists a number of other names for them in both English and Welsh. Owen likewise linked his Freckled Cow with a number of similar cows such as one over the border in Shropshire: \\"There she is known as The White Cow of Mitchell's Fold\\". This cow also gave a pail of milk to anyone who came until a witch milked her dry.

He completed his military education in 1992, when he met fellow adventurer-to-be Torry Larsen, also of M√∏re og Romsdal. Gjeldnes served in the Norwegian Naval Special Operations Command until 1997. Expeditions Together with Torry Larsen, Rune Gjeldnes travelled across Greenland in 1996. In 1997, he planned and completed the \\"Arctic Ocean 2000\\" expedition--a 109-day, 2,100-kilometer trip--becoming the first to cross the Arctic Ocean without resupplies. In 1998, Gjeldnes and Bj√∏rn Loe became the first to paddle the Rio Merevari in Venezuela. Gjeldnes participated in North Pole expeditions in 1997 and 1998, crossed Baffin Island in northern Canada in 1998, and later the same year climbed Mt Aconcagua (). From 1999 to 2000, he again worked for the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN). =The Longest March= In February 2006, Rune Gjeldnes completed \\"The Longest March\\", a three-month solo ski trek across the South Pole region, becoming the first person to cross that area alone without being resupplied. His route went from Queen Maud Land, over the Pole, and on to Terra Nova Bay. The final couple of weeks of the journey had to be made on foot, as Gjeldnes had lost one of his mountain skis off his sled, this before having to descend a glacier of ASL in order to reach his destination. The distance is the equivalent of the distance between New York City and San Francisco by road across the United States. The expedition had a scientific element as Gjeldnes took regular blood samples of himself to be used in studies of the human immune system under extreme conditions. He now holds the records of the longest ski journey without being resupplied and the longest ski journey generally. He is the only person to ski across the North Pole, the South Pole and Greenland without resupply.

The film stars comedian Andrew Dice Clay as the title character, Ford Fairlane, a \\"Rock n' Roll Detective\\", whose beat is the music industry in Los Angeles. True to his name, Ford drives a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner in the film. The film's main character was created by writer Rex Weiner in a series of stories that were published as weekly serials in 1979‚Äì80 by the New York Rocker and the LA Weekly. The stories were published as a book by Rare Bird Books in July 2018. The film was both a commercial and critical failure, just barely breaking even with its budget and being awarded the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, tying with Bo Derek's Ghosts Can't Do It. However, it has since achieved worldwide cult status, and it has gone under critical re-evaluation in Hungary, Spain, and Norway. Moreover, Billy Idol's \\"Cradle of Love\\" became one of his biggest hits on the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at #2). Plot Ford Fairlane is seen sitting on a beach smoking as the film opens. A flashback initiates, showing a roaring crowd at a concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado given by fictional popular heavy metal band The Black Plague. Lead singer Bobby Black makes an eccentric entrance down a zip-line from Creation Rock onto the stage and begins performing. Shortly into one of the band's songs, Bobby Black collapses on stage and dies. After the lead singer of The Black Plague is murdered onstage, shock-jock Johnny Crunch, an old friend who came west with Fairlane, hires Ford to track down a mysterious teenage groupie named Zuzu Petals, who may have a connection to Black's death. Soon after hiring Fairlane, Crunch is electrocuted on the air. The world's hippest detective soon finds himself trading insults with ruthless record executive Julian Grendel, a clueless cop and former disco star, Lt. Amos, a merciless hit man named Smiley and countless ex-girlfriends out for his blood. Aiding and abetting Fairlane is loyal assistant Jazz and a hip record producer at the head of a bizarre lineup of suspects, victims, beautiful women, and a koala as he finds himself hip-deep in the case of his life. The MacGuffin of the film is three data CDs which, when read simultaneously, detail the illegal dealings of Julian Grendel, who was getting rich from bootlegging his record company's music and murdered Bobby Black when he found out Black had acquired the CDs with the incriminating evidence. Both of Fairlane's beloved possessions, his house, and his car, are blown to bits, courtesy of Grendel. The first disc was with Colleen Sutton, the second with Zuzu Petals, and the third disc was hidden under the star for Art Mooney on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is later revealed that Grendel killed Bobby Black and Johnny Crunch, as he considered them both greedy and stupid because they wanted more money for their involvement in pirating CD's to sell to the highest bidder, making the music industry corrupt. However, Fairlane kills Grendel by setting him on fire with a flammable alcoholic milkshake. Jazz leaves Fairlane, knowing how ungrateful he is for everything that has happened. Smiley shows up and plans to kill Ford, but not before revealing that he killed his young neighbor's [the Kid's] father. Ford distracts him and kills Smiley with a sleeve pistol. Jazz and Ford decide to reconcile, while the Kid decides to join their detective agency. Ford wins a million dollar radio contest and buys a yacht. He sails away with Jazz, the Kid and the koala bear. They're all now one big happy family.

The official soundtrack release featured: # \\"Cradle of Love\\" ‚Äî Billy Idol # \\"Sea Cruise\\" ‚Äî Dion # \\"Funky Attitude\\" ‚Äî Sheila E. # \\"Glad to Be Alive\\" ‚Äî Lisa Fischer, Teddy Pendergrass # \\"Can't Get Enough\\" ‚Äî Tone Loc # \\"Rock 'N Roll Junkie\\" ‚Äî M√∂tley Cr√ºe # \\"I Ain't Got You\\" ‚Äî Andrew Dice Clay # \\"Last Time in Paris\\" ‚Äî Queensr√øche # \\"Unbelievable\\" ‚Äî Yello # \\"Wind Cries Mary\\" ‚Äî Richie Sambora The film's soundtrack includes Idol's \\"Cradle of Love\\", the video for which was shown often on MTV in 1990. The song also appeared on Idol's 1990 album Charmed Life. In the video, a young woman, played by Betsy Lynn George, taunts an uptight neighbor with her advances as she dances to the music. The video also featured footage from the film playing on a television in the neighbor's home, although none of the footage features Clay (at least not his face). This may be due to the infamous ban of Clay from appearing on the music network. Alternate versions of the \\"Cradle of Love\\" video eliminates the film footage when the video is usually aired on MTV. Richie Sambora's contribution to the soundtrack was a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song. Yello's \\"Unbelievable\\" samples bits of dialogue from the film, with one notable dialog switch - where in the film, a phone number is said as \\"1-800-Unbelivable\\" and in the song, the phone number is said as \\"1-800-Perfect\\". In the original theatrical release of the film, the line was \\"1-800-Perfect\\" but was changed most likely due to the fact that the number belonged to a business at the time. A number of the musicians featured on the soundtrack also appeared in the film itself, including Morris Day, Sheila E., Tone Loc (as Slam the Rapper), former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Phil Soussan, and drummer Randy Castillo appear playing the Black Plague concert during the flashback at the beginning of the film and Vince Neil, the lead singer of M√∂tley Cr√ºe (who appeared as Bobby Black, the lead singer of the fictitious band, Black Plague). Black Plague's lead guitarist was played by Quiet Riot's axeman Carlos Cavazzo. Not appearing on the soundtrack is \\"Booty Time\\", the song that Ed O'Neill's character performs during the film. Yello is also credited with the film's \\"music score\\", and an early cut of their album Baby is used as the film's incidental soundtrack. Release Billy Idol's recording of \\"Cradle of Love\\" was named one of the \\"Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures\\" by the ASCAP.https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/ASCAP_Film_and_Television_Music_Awards/1991 =Critical response= The film received generally negative reviews upon release. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 28% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 3.74/10. On Metacritic, the film has a 24 out of 100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B\\" on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of a possible 4, and called the film \\"loud, ugly and mean-spirited\\" but he also suggested that Clay had the confidence and screen presence for a successful acting career if he could move beyond his shtick. =Box office= The film was not a financial success during its original theatrical release, making just over $21 million in the U.S. Clay has claimed in interviews that the film had a successful first week before being pulled from theaters under pressure from the politically correct. In fact, the film played on more screens during its second week than its first, but still suffered a 53.5% drop in box office gross. =Accolades= The film \\"won\\" numerous Razzies at the 1990 Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Actor (Andrew Dice Clay), Worst Picture (Joel Silver & Steve Perry ‚Äî tied with Ghosts Can't Do It), and Worst Screenplay (Daniel Waters, James Cappe and David Arnott). It was also nominated for Worst Director and twice for Worst Supporting Actor (for both Gilbert Gottfried and Wayne Newton).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098987/awards =International reception= Despite negative reviews in the US, the film enjoyed success in post-communist Hungary, where copies of a pirated, dubbed version were widely circulated in the burgeoning VHS market. The film's popularity in Hungary has been attributed to a high-quality dub starring iconic eccentric musician and actor Fer√≥ Nagy, which contains gratuitous use of profanity not found in the original English version of the film. Several lines of dialogue from the film became ingrained in the slang of Hungarian urban youth culture throughout the 1990s. The film received similar cult status in Norway after its 1992 VHS release, and demand led to the film being released on DVD there in the early 2000s. It also became quite popular in Spain, especially due to the dub by the popular singer, actor and comedian Pablo Carbonell.

Recorded on October 16, 1992, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, it captures most of the concert, which featured many artists performing classic Dylan songs, before ending with three songs from Dylan himself. The house band for the show were the surviving members of Booker T. & the M.G.'s: Booker T. Jones on organ, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn on bass, and Steve Cropper on guitar. Joining them was drummer Anton Fig filling in for the late Al Jackson, plus drummer Jim Keltner. Longtime Saturday Night Live bandleader G. E. Smith served as the music director. The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, which reached #40 (in the US and went gold), was released in August 1993 just before Dylan was about to deliver his second folk studio set inside of a year, World Gone Wrong. The concert was dubbed \\"Bobfest\\" by Neil Young at the beginning of his \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" cover. A VHS collection of the same name was released on August 25, 1993. On March 4, 2014, the concert was released in Deluxe Edition 2-DVD and Blu-ray sets with bonus performances and behind-the- scenes rehearsal footage, as well as a 2-CD set with two bonus rehearsal tracks.

There, she formally acted as Third Secretary, but her position was described as ‚Äúlocal rank,‚ÄùBochner, ‚Äú1958: Canada appoints first woman ambassador.‚Äù meaning she was considered a foreign secretary abroad but maintained her status and salary as a clerk in Ottawa.Turenne-Sjolander, ‚ÄúMargaret Meagher and the Role of Women,‚Äù 227.

Meagher also served as a member of the National museums of Canada's board of trustees on several occasions, acting as the representative on behalf of the Atlantic Canada region. At the local level, she served in several board of governors of Nova Scotian post-secondary institutions, including the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design from 1984 to 1989, as well as the Atlantic School of Theology.Weiers, Envoys Extraordinary, 60. Meagher died in 1999 at the age of 88.Laucius, ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs first female ambassador did it with quiet competence: Career spanned 4 decades,‚Äù A14. Legacy In light of her gender and social circumstances, Meagher‚Äôs work in the Canadian Foreign Service is generally considered to have been significant in paving the way for women in diplomacy. Many believe that her career proved that women could perform diplomatically at the same level as men, which pressured the Foreign Service to continue to incorporate more women into their traditionally male-dominated diplomatic corps.Weiers, Envoys Extraordinary, 61. Meagher was conscious of her unique and influential position in Canadian foreign affairs. In an interview, she stated: > ‚ÄúNot only was I the only woman head of mission everywhere I went, there were > very few women members of any rank in the diplomatic corps. [...] I was, > after all, blazing a trail and whether I performed well, or fell flat on my > face might have had some influence, at least for a time, on the appointment > of other women.‚ÄùWeiers, Envoys Extraordinary, 61. Because she remained single throughout her life, Meagher was able to pursue a full-time career in the Foreign Service, which would otherwise not have been permitted due to government-imposed restrictions on married women holding federal civil service jobs.Turenne-Sjolander, ‚ÄúMargaret Meagher and the Role of Women,‚Äù 231.

Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. It was incorporated on December 22, 1947. After building the ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania, Eckert and Mauchly formed EMCC to build new computer designs for commercial and military applications. The company was initially called the Electronic Control Company, changing its name to Eckert‚ÄìMauchly Computer Corporation when it was incorporated. In 1950, the company was sold to Remington Rand, which later merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand, and survives today as Unisys. Founding Before founding Eckert‚ÄìMauchly Computer Corporation, Mauchly researched the computing needs of potential clients. Over a period of six months in 1944 he prepared memos and kept detailed notes of his conversations. For instance, Mauchly met with United States Census Bureau official William Madow to discuss the computing equipment they desired. The Census Bureau was particularly keen on reducing the number of punch cards it had to manage with each census. This meeting led to Madow making a trip to see ENIAC in person. Mauchly also met with Lt. Colonel Solomon Kullback, an official at the Army Signal Corps, to discuss codes and ciphers. Kullback said there was a need for many \\"faster and more flexible\\" computers at his agency. Mauchly responded by carefully analyzing EDVAC's potential encryption and decryption abilities. Eckert and Mauchly thus believed there was strong government demand for their future products. By the spring of 1946, Eckert and Mauchly had procured a U.S. Army contract for the University of Pennsylvania and were already designing the EDVAC the successor machine to the ENIAC at the university's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. However, new university policies that would have forced Eckert and Mauchly to sign over intellectual property rights for their inventions led to their resignation, which caused a lengthy delay in the EDVAC design efforts. After seeking to join IBM and John von Neumann's team at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, they decided to start their own company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. UNIVAC Mauchly persuaded the United States Census Bureau to order an \\"EDVAC II\\" computer a model that was soon renamed UNIVAC receiving a contract in 1948 that called for having the machine ready for the 1950 census. Eckert hired a staff that included a number of the engineers from the Moore School, and the company launched an ambitious program to design and manufacture large- scale computing machines. A major achievement was the use of magnetic tape for high-speed storage. During development Mauchly continued to solicit new customers and started a software department. They developed applications, starting with the world's first compiler for the language Short Code. =Accusations of communist infiltration= EMCC also received contracts for one UNIVAC machine each for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. These contracts were eventually canceled after the company was accused of having hired engineers with \\"Communistic leanings\\" during the McCarthy era. The company lost its clearance for government work. Company president and chief salesman Mauchly was banned from the company property. He challenged the accusations, but it took two years before a hearing allowed him to work at his company again; by then the UNIVAC was seriously behind schedule. The programming to allow the UNIVAC I to be used in predicting the outcome of the 1952 Presidential election had to be done by Mauchly and University of Pennsylvania statistician Max Woodbury at Mauchly's home in Ambler, Pennsylvania. BINAC and fiscal difficulties Cash flow was poor and the UNIVAC would not be finished for quite some time, so EMCC decided to take on another project that would be done quickly. This was the BINAC, a small computer (compared to ENIAC) for the Northrop corporation. Original estimates for the development costs proved to be extremely unrealistic, and by the summer of 1948, EMCC had just about run out of money, but it was temporarily saved by Harry L. Straus, vice president of the American Totalisator Company, a Baltimore company that made electromechanical totalisators. Straus felt that EMCC's work, besides being promising in general terms, might have some application in the race track business, and invested $500,000 in the company. Straus became chairman of the EMCC board, and American Totalisator received 40 percent of the stock. When Straus was killed in an airplane crash in October 1949, American Totalisator's directors withdrew their support. BINAC was eventually delivered in 1949, but Northrop complained that it never worked well for them. (It had worked fine in acceptance tests at EMCC, but Northrop, citing security concerns, refused to allow any EMCC employees onto their site to reassemble it after shipping. Instead, Northrop hired a newly graduated electrical engineer to assemble it. EMCC claimed that the fact that it worked at all after this was testimony to the quality of the design.) It was generally believed at EMCC that Northrop allowed BINAC to sit, disassembled, in their parking lot for a long time before any effort toward assembly was made. Sale to Remington Rand presidential election night, 1952. J. Presper Eckert (c.), co-designer of the UNIVAC, and Harold Sweeny of the US Census Bureau, with Walter Cronkite (r.) As had happened with BINAC, EMCC's estimates of delivery dates and costs proved to be optimistic, and the company was soon in financial difficulty again. In early 1950, the company was for sale; potential buyers included National Cash Register and Remington Rand. Remington Rand made the first offer, and purchased EMCC on February 15, 1950, whereupon it became the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand. The first UNIVAC was not delivered until March 1951, over a year after EMCC was acquired by Remington Rand, and too late to help much for the 1950 census. However, upon acceptance at the company premises, truck load after truck load of punched cards arrived to be recorded on tape (by what was called jokingly the card to pulp converters) for processing by UNIVAC. The US Census Bureau used the prototype UNIVAC on EMCC premises for months. Mauchly resigned from Remington Rand in 1952; his 10-year contract with them ran until 1960, and prohibited him from working on other computer projects during that time. Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation in 1955, and in 1975, the division was renamed Sperry UNIVAC. The company's corporate descendant today is Unisys. References External links * John W.

It is the only biography authorized by McVeigh himself, and was based on 75 hours of interviews that the authors had with McVeigh. McVeigh was said to be pleased overall with the book, but disappointed with the way he was portrayed and the explanation of his motive. Coauthor Michel said he viewed McVeigh as a \\"human being with a limited range of feelings in the areas of empathy and sympathy and with an oversized sense of rage and resentment.\\" According to Salon, McVeigh is portrayed in the book as an extremist: On April 19, 2010, a two- hour special, the \\"McVeigh Tapes\\", narrated by Rachel Maddow, was aired by MSNBC which was based on 45 hours of the interviews that Michel conducted with McVeigh while he was in prison.

He did postdoctoral work at UCLA, and was a Research Fellow at AT&T; Bell Laboratories before joining the staff of IBM‚Äôs Research Division at the Watson Research Center in 1978. In 1984, he became manager of Chemical Physics, and in 2004, he was elected an IBM Fellow. He is currently Manager of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. He has also been an adjunct professor at Columbia University and the University of Illinois. Over the years, his research has involved such areas as laser spectroscopy, surface physics and chemistry, scanning tunneling microscopy, atom manipulation, and nanoelectronics. His current research is focused on experimental and theoretical studies of the electrical, optical, and optoelectronic properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene. The work includes the design, fabrication, and study of nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices and circuits. He has published over 360 scientific papers on these subjects. Research activities Avouris has been a trailblazer in the nanoscience and nanotechnology field. He pioneered the use of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study surface chemistry on the atomic scale, and establish the relation between chemical reactivity and local electronic structure. He demonstrated device-like behavior on the atomic scale, observed electron confinement and interference effects at surfaces. He also manipulated covalently bonded atoms with atomic precision. More recently, Avouris has made critical discoveries, both experimental and theoretical, on the electronics and photonics of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene, and has laid the foundations of future carbon-based nanotechnology. In 1998 Avouris‚Äô team at IBM independently demonstrated the very first molecular transistor based on a single CNT. Subsequently, he optimized the design and performance of the CNT field-effect transistors, enabling them to outperform silicon devices. Avouris and co-workers then produced the first CNT logic-gates and integrated circuits based on CNTs. They showed that transport in CNTs is controlled by Schottky barriers, found ways to dope CNTs, and analyzed the role of inelastic phonon scattering. Avouris and his group demonstrated, for the first time, electrically generated light emission and photoconductivity from CNTs, and analyzed theoretically the properties of CNT excitons. He studied in detail the mechanisms of photo- and current-induced excitation of these one- dimensional systems and opened up the possibility of a unified electronic and optoelectronic technology based on the same carbon materials.

They have been described as Ireland's first punk band. Initially active 1976-1981, the band had a brief reunion in 1987-1988, and reformed in 2003 until the death of founding member Philip Chevron in 2013, with remaining members continuing as Trouble Pilgrims. History The band formed in 1976 in Dublin, and consisted of Philip \\"Chevron\\" Ryan, Pete Holidai, Steve \\"Rapid\\" Averill, Jimmy \\"Crashe\\" Wynne and Mark \\"Megaray\\" Horgan. Founded during punk's first wave, they are generally regarded as Ireland's first punk band. They signed to Chiswick Records and released the album TV Tube Heart in 1977. Their first single \\"Television Screen\\" was the first and only punk record to make the Irish top 20, and was featured on many punk compilation albums over the next few years. The band toured Ireland and the UK, including stint opening for Thin Lizzy on the UK leg of their 1977 Bad Reputation tour, and a headlining UK tour of their own in 1978. Shortening their name to The Radiators, the band released their second album,Ghostown, in 1979. Produced by Tony Visconti, Ghostown received critical acclaim, but failed to sell well. After a move to London, the band disbanded in 1981. After some solo recording, Philip Chevron went on to join The Pogues. Steve Averill became a successful designer in the 1980s, known for his work for the band U2. In 1987 The Radiators reformed for one gig, an AIDS benefit in Dublin. The Chevron-penned song Under Clery's Clock, a love song and a protest against homophobia, is premiered at the show and released as a single the following year. The band reunited in December 2003, using the name \\"The Radiators Plan 9\\". Original members Chevron, Holidai, and Rapid were joined by former Pogue Cait O'Riordan on bass and vocals, and Johnny Bonnie on drums. The band played three shows, including a Joe Strummer tribute and an appearance at the Oxegen Festival, as well as making several live radio appearances. Some of these performances were compiled onto the Television Screen 2004 EP, released on the 625 record label. The Summer Season EP, which included two new songs, was released in 2005. O'Riordan departed the band, replaced by new bass player Jesse Booth in February 2006. Reverting to the name The Radiators From Space, the band released their third studio album Trouble Pilgrim in October 2006. On 21 December 2006, they played at 'The Point', Dublin, as a special guest of The Pogues. The band's fourth album, Sound City Beat, a collection of cover versions of songs by older Irish bands, was released in 2012. Members of the band began performing as Trouble Pilgrims after member Philip Chevron became ill with throat cancer and was unable to participate in live work. The band played, including with guest vocalist Gavin Friday and guitarist Brush Shiels, at a tribute concert for Chevron on August 24, 2013 at the Olympia Theatre (Dublin). Philip Chevron died October 8, 2013, effectively ending the band, although remaining members have continued as Trouble Pilgrims. The song \\"Television Screen\\", as covered by Centipede on the Roof, became title theme to the comedy TV series The Blizzard of Odd (2001‚Äì05). The Radiators' songs have been recorded by Moving Hearts] and [Christy Moore (\\"Faithful Departed\\") and Mary Coughlan (\\"Kitty Rickets\\"), among others.

At some time between 3:50 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on Friday, 20 October 1989 a southbound semi-trailer truck carrying a load of tinned fruit juice veered onto the wrong side of the road and collided with a Sunliner Express bus travelling the other way. The bus was carrying forty-five passengers. The impact of the semi-trailer truck resulted in a penetration of the side of the bus, both spilling passengers onto the road as well as causing trauma for passengers within the bus interior. At the time, this crash was the worst in Australian road transport history in terms of number of deaths. The driver of the truck, who was among the dead, was found to have a high concentration of ephedrine in his blood, a stimulant similar in effect to the amphetamines. The concentration found was 80 times in excess of the normal therapeutic level, even for chronic users. It was subsequently found that the truck driver used ephedrine to stay awake and alert, a then common usage by long distance drivers. Reaction and consequences This crash was one of several on the Pacific Highway involving buses during a relatively brief period. Less than five months previously, another bus had run off the road, with no fatalities; only two months later, on 22 December 1989, the Kempsey bus crash involving two buses killed 35 passengers. The inquest into the Grafton bus crash was conducted by means of two sets of hearings in early 1990. The first hearings established the specific causes of the crash, and the second hearings examined matters relevant to road safety in Australia: speed limits on undivided highways; speed limiters in motor vehicles, particularly in heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses; drivers having multiple licences from different Australian jurisdictions; the transfer of driver and vehicle information among Australian states and territories; the collection, collation, analysis and reporting of road crash statistics; driver fatigue, including drowsiness and obstructive sleep apnoea; the regulation of driving hours for truck and bus drivers; drugged driving; aftermarket fitment of bullbars on motor vehicles; construction standards for buses and bus seats; the use of multi-combination heavy vehicles such as B-double trucks and road trains; mass and dimension standards for trucks; the use of radar detector devices to avoid police speed enforcement; road safety advertising and education; and general matters associated with road construction and national road transport and road freight policies. The response to these incidents was an effort in Australia, and particularly in New South Wales, to better regulate the heavy transport industry. This included banning \\"stay-awake\\" drugs, limiting uninterrupted driving time and mandating rest periods. The design standards of long-distance buses and their safety equipment were also reviewed and a proposal made to upgrade the Pacific Highway to a divided road all the way between Sydney and Brisbane. There is a memorial to the travellers involved in the Grafton Bus Disaster located on a closed-off section of the old Pacific Highway at Cowper. This accident and the Kempsey bus crash eight weeks later were described as \\"arguably Australia‚Äôs most catastrophic examples of high consequence/low probability incidents in the bus industry\\" in a bus safety discussion document.National Transport Commission Improving Safety Management in Australia‚Äôs Bus Industry 2008 The bus involved in the accident belonged to Sunliner Express. The coroner‚Äôs report cleared the bus of any responsibility for the accident. The bus company was liquidated in 1991 and the owners later founded Transit Systems in 1995.

Construction was begun in 1835, however, was delayed during the Panic of 1837. Although the economic downturn lingered until 1843, the railroad was completed by January 1838. In August 1850, the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad joined the Auburn and Rochester Railroad to form the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad, which later merged with the New York Central Railroad. History Syracuse railroad \\"subscribers\\" contributed $31,000 to the $400,000 stock authorized in the incorporation articles received on May 1, 1834. Among the 20 investors was Vivus W. Smith, who later was one of the founders of the Syracuse Journal. =Horse drawn= The work had been done \\"on the cheap\\", with low quality railbed preparation and wood rails. The Auburn and Syracuse Railroad was opened for business on January 8, 1838, with horse-drawn trains and did not use steam locomotives until the introduction of its first, the Syracuse, on June 14, 1839. =Steam locomotive= Only after the advent of the steam railroad did the train finally arrive in Syracuse. Originally a mill pond on the site of the State Armory, located at the present-day Armory Square on West Jefferson Street, blocked the right of way. Until a trestle was built across the pond, passengers were no longer \\"forced to find other means\\" of getting into the village of Syracuse from a temporary station at Geddes. =Auburn road= Known as the Auburn Road (a nickname that later passed to the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad), the company erected a new depot between Salina and Clinton streets in late 1838. Work on the trestle was completed in early 1839 as well as construction of a new railroad station in Downtown Syracuse. By late 1839, one of the trains achieved the run in 58 minutes. A year later, in 1840, the event was reported in the Western State Journal While passenger service constituted the bulk of the company's revenue operations, an arrangement under the existing canal protection laws allowed the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad (A&S;) to carry freight as well. In this capacity, it served the Erie Canal rather than competing against it. =Depot= The depot was replaced in 1839 when the depot of the Syracuse and Utica Railroad was ready for use. The depot of the original Auburn Road was not known for either beauty or finish, presenting a \\"striking contrast to its majestic neighbor across the street.\\" =Rochester and Syracuse railroad= On 1 August 1850, the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad joined the Auburn and Rochester Railroad to form the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad. =New York Central railroad= A weak link in the network of rail lines in New York State, the A&S; achieved distinction only in becoming a constituent of one of the world's genuinely significant rail companies, the New York Central Railroad. It was one of eight independent small lines in upstate New York which Erastus Corning, of Albany, saw as the basis of a statewide consolidation. In 1853, this company became part of the New York Central Railroad. Into the 1940s the New York Central operated at least two passenger trains per day in each direction on the route, with an additional train between Geneva and Syracuse each day except Sundays.New York Central April 25, 1948 timetable, Table 51 http://streamlinermemories.info/NYC/NYC48-4TT.pdf The NYC operated one train a day on the route until 1958.New York Central February 16, 1958 timetable, Table 38New York Central October 10, 1958 timetable =Stations served on the route= The following were the stations served on the route in its last years of service:New York Central February 16, 1958 timetable, Table 38 *Syracuse (at Syracuse passengers could make connections to other New York Central trains to Boston, New York City and New York's North Country *Camillus (westbound only) *Martisco (westbound only) *Skaneateles Jct. *Auburn *Cayuga *Seneca Falls *Waterloo *Geneva *Oaks Corners (eastbound only) *Phelps *Clifton Springs *Shortsville *Chapin *Canandaigua *Victor *Pittsford *Rochester External links * The Auburn Road: A Study in Early Engineering, Richard F.

FCO is only used for astronomical research. Farm Cove Observatory takes part in cataclysmic variable star (CV) research for the Center for Backyard Astrophysics and is also known as CBA Pakuranga. Up to January 2006, FCO has contributed over 1400 hours of data to the CBA, and the data from this observatory has been used in a number of scientific papers. In April 2004 Farm Cove Observatory joined the MicroFUN collaboration headed by Professor Andrew Gould at Ohio State University. The mission of MicroFUN is to obtain intense photometric monitoring of high magnification gravitational microlensing events in the hope of detecting planets orbiting the lensing star. Most of these events are found in the dense star fields of the bulge of the Milky Way galaxy. The first success came in April 2005 when an exoplanet was detected in the event OGLE-2005-BLG-071 . The discovery was attributed to 31 professional astronomers and two amateurs. FCO contributed 12 hours of observations to this event. This new planet is about three times the mass of Jupiter and lies some 15,000 light-years toward the Galactic Bulge. This was only the second exoplanet detected by this technique and the first exoplanet discovery involving amateur observations. Recently, FCO has been contributing unfiltered magnitude measures to the British Astronomical Association campaign on Blazar OJ+287.

Plot After writing a series of articles about a pedophilia scandal, journalist Ji-won receives threatening calls on her cellular and subsequently changes her number. Her close friend Ho-jung, who is infertile, and her husband Chang-hoon invite Ji- won to move to their empty house in Bang Bae that is newly furnished. When Ho- jung's daughter Young-ju answers an anonymous phone call on Ji-won's new cell phone, the girl screams and begins to show a disturbing attraction for her father and jealous rejection towards her mother. Meanwhile, Ji-won receives more mysterious phone calls and sees a teenager playing Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" on the piano. After investigating her phone number, Ji-won discovers that the original owner of the number, Jin-hee, had vanished and that the two subsequent owners of the number had died mysteriously in unusual circumstances. Her further investigation about Jin-hee reveals that the teenage schoolgirl was obsessively in love with a man who had broken up with her. Before Jin-hee vanished, Ji-won found out that Jin-hee was in a relationship with Chang-hoon. Ho-jung found out about the affair and confronted Jin-hee. During their confrontation, Jin-hee mocked Ho-jung's infertility problem and told Ho-jung that she was pregnant with Chang-hoon's baby. In a struggle between the two women, Ho-jung accidentally pushed Jin-hee down the stairs and killed her. Ji-won also discovers that Jin-hee's dead body was hidden inside one of the walls at the house she is staying at. However, before Ji-won can go out for help, Ho-Jung arrives and knocks her out. Ho-jung reveals that aside of Jin-hee, Ho-jung is also jealous of Ji-won, who had let her egg be used in in vitro fertilisation so Ho-jung could conceive Young-ju, which technically made Ji-won the true biological mother of Young-ju. It is also revealed that Ho-Jung stages suicide for Chang-hoon, making it seem that he is guilty of Jin-hee's death, so he commits suicide in the bathtub. Ho-jung plans to burn the body of Jin-hee and the unconscious Ji-won with gasoline. However, Jin-hee's spirit awakens and takes revenge on Ho-jung, thus saving Ji-won.

Turkey learned that Greece was starting to drill for oil in the Aegean Sea in the vicinity of Thasos, generally considered Greek but disputed by Turkey. In response, the Turkish survey ship Piri Reis, and later the RV MTA Sismik 1, was sent to the area to conduct survey with an escort of Turkish warships. Background Oil was discovered off Thasos, in 1973. Greece claimed ownership of mineral rights in the continental shelf extending from beneath all its islands in the Aegean. Turkey proposed that the continental shelf be divided through negotiations. Events In March 1987, a decision of the Greek government to nationalize the consortium of companies that was drilling oil off Thasos, and planned exploratory oil drilling 11 miles east of the island of Thasos, such as the impression by Turkey that Greece was planning new researches for oil, provoked tension between the two countries. The crisis escalated, armed forces of both countries were on alert, and both sides said they would use force if obstructed by the other. The incident nearly started a war between Greece and Turkey. Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou gave the orders to sink the ship if it was found in the waters claimed by Greece. Turkish Prime Minister Turgut √ñzal said that \\"If Greece interferes with our vessel in any way, and this is what Papandreou is saying, we will act in the same way against him\\", \\"As a result, it could be cause for war.\\", but he also added that \\"We are waiting for the first move from them.\\" The Greek foreign minister Karolos Papoulias was sent to Bulgaria (then a member of the Warsaw Pact) for discussions. The Greek government gave orders for the suspension of operation of the base of NATO in Nea Makri, while the Greek forces and Navy were alarmed. Britain's Lord Carrington, the secretary general of NATO, urged Greece and Turkey to avoid the use of force and offered to act as a mediator. The crisis was solved when √ñzal announced that if the Greek government did not enter the disputed waters, the Turks would stay out as well; he participated in a phone call with Papandreou.

In Hinduism, it refers to a concept of monism akin to that of Brahman in Advaita philosophy and Smarta theology. Truth is One A well- known statement is \\"Truth is one, sages call it by various names.\\" It is derived from Rig Veda Samhita 1.164.46: \\"They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutman. To what is One, sages give many a title. They call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.\\".Rig Veda Samhita 1.164.46, Wiki Source According to William A. Graham, \\"the one\\" in verse 1.164.46 refers to VƒÅc, goddess of speech, appearing as \\"the creative force and absolute force in the universe.\\" In later Vedic literature, \\"Speech or utterance is also identified with the supreme power or transcendent reality,\\" and \\"equated with Brahman in this sense.\\"William A. Graham, Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion, pp. 70‚Äì71. Frauwallner states that \\"many gods are traced back to the one Godhead. The one (ekam) is not meant adjectively as a quality but as a substantive, as the upholding centre of reality.\\" Ayyavazhi Ekam (Tamil: ‡Æè‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç, \\"the supreme oneness\\") is the term used in Akilathirattu Ammanai, the holy book of the religion of Ayyavazhi, Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989 Page 225-227 to represent The Ultimate Oneness. In Thiruvasakam-2 it was stated that it was from this Ekam that all objects, including the separate Godheads, Devas and asuras, of the universe formed. As per Akilam, this state of ekam is beyond the consciousness and derived to beyond the state of changing and is the extreme state in which the whole universe exists. Evolution of Ekam, the source of whole existence as described in Akilam In Saivism, Ekam is used commonly to refer to the oneness of God, but in Ayyavazhi the basic oneness is separately symbolized to be supreme and ultimate beyond all God-heads and powers. The derivations of Ekam in Ayyavazhi scriptures are sometimes close to the pantheistic form of theology. In the mythology of Ayyavazhi God-heads such as Siva, Vishnu are said to be the godheads who have power to rule this Ekam, varying from time to time, Siva until Kaliyuga and Vishnu from the starting of Kaliyuga. There are separate quotes in Akilam for focusing Siva as well as Vishnu in charge of this position. But, still the Ekam is addressed beyond these god-heads. But when Vaikundar, is jailed in Singarathoppe, he says \\"I am the one who created the Ekam and the one who is omnipresent everywhere\\". By this, the theology reveals Vaikundar (God) as beyond the attributes of Ekam, which moves the theology of Ayyavazhi more towards pantheism.

Named after the founder Idriss I, the great grandchild of Hasan ibn Ali, the Idrisids are considered to be the founders of the first Moroccan state. History The founder of the dynasty was Idris ibn Abdallah (788‚Äì791),Idris I, D. Eustache, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. III, ed. B.Lewis, V. L. Menage, C. Pellat and J. Schact, (Brill, 1986), 1031. who traced his ancestry back to Ali ibn Abi Talib and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. After the Battle of Fakhkh, near Mecca, between the Abbasids and supporters of the descendants of the prophet Muhammad, Idris ibn Abdallah fled to the Maghreb. He first arrived in Tangier, the most important city of Morocco at the time, and by 788 he had settled in Volubilis. The powerful Awraba Berbers of Volubilis (or Walili as the Berbers called it) took him in and made him their 'imam' (religious leader). The Awraba tribe had supported Kusayla in his struggle against the Ummayad armies in the 670s and 680s. By the second half of the 8th century they had settled in northern Morocco, where their leader Ishak had his base in the Roman town of Volubilis. By this time the Awraba were already Muslim, but lived in an area where most tribes were either Christian, Jewish, Khariji or pagan. The Awraba seem to have welcomed a Sharifi imam as a way to strengthen their political position. Idris I, who was very active in the political organization of the Awraba, began by asserting his authority and working toward the subjugation of the Christian and Jewish tribes. In 789 he founded a settlement south east of Volubilis, called Medinat Fas. In 791 Idris I was poisoned and killed by an Abbasid agent. Even though he left no male heir, shortly after his death, his wife Lalla Kanza bint Uqba al-Awrabi, bore him his only son and successor, Idris II. Idris' loyal Arab ex-slave and companion Rashid brought up the boy and took on himself the regency of the state, on behalf of the Awraba. In 801 Rashid was killed by the Abbasids. In the following year, at the age of 11 years, Idris II was proclaimed imam by the Awraba. Even though he had spread his authority across much of northern Morocco, as far west as Tlemcen, Idris I had been completely dependent on the Awraba leadership. Idris II began his rule with the weakening of Awraba power by welcoming Arab settlers in Walili and by appointing two Arabs as his vizier and qadi. Thus he transformed himself from a prot√©g√© of the Awraba into their sovereign. The Awraba leader Ishak responded by plotting against his life with the Aghlabids of Tunisia. Idris reacted by having his former protector Ishak killed, and in 809 moved his seat of government from the Awraba dominated Walili to Fes, where he founded a new settlement named Al-'Aliya. Idriss II (791‚Äì828) developed the city of Fez, established earlier by his father as a Berber market town. Here he welcomed two waves of Arab immigration: one in 818 from Cordoba and another in 824 from Aghlabid Tunisia, giving Fes a more Arab character than other Maghrebi cities. When Idris II died in 828, the Idrisid state spanned from western Algeria to the Sous in southern Morocco and had become the leading state of Morocco, ahead of the principalities of Sijilmasa, Barghawata and Nekor. The dynasty would decline following Idriss II's death and under his son and successor Muhammad (828‚Äì836) the kingdom was divided amongst seven of his brothers, whereby eight Idrisid statelets formed in Morocco and Algeria.Idrisids, D. Eustache, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. III, 1035. Muhammad himself came to rule Fes, with only nominal power over his brothers. During this time Islamic and Arabic culture gained a stronghold in the towns and Morocco profited from the trans-Saharan trade, which came to be dominated by Muslim (mostly Berber) traders. Fountain at Place Nejjarine, Fez, dating from the Idrisid dynasty. Even so, the Islamic and Arabic culture only made its influence felt in the towns, with the vast majority of Morocco's population still using the Berber languages and often adhering to Islamic heterodox and heretical doctrines. The Idrisids were principally rulers of the towns and had little power over the majority of the country's population. The Idrisid family in turn was heavily berberised, with its members aligning itself with the Zenata tribes of Morocco. Already in the 870s the family was described by Ibn Qutaybah as being berberised in customs. By the 11th century this process had developed to such an extent, that the family was fully integrated in the Berber societies of Morocco. In the 11th century the Hammudid family arose among these Berber Idrisids, which was able to gain power in several cities of northern Morocco and southern Spain. Idrisid dirham, minted at al-'Aliyah (Fes), Morocco, 840 CE. The coin features the name of Ali: a son-in-law of Muhammad, the fourth Caliph, and an ancestor of the Idrisids.alt= In 868 the Berber Khariji tribes of Madyuna, Ghayata and Miknasa of the Fes region formed a common front against the Idrisids. From their base in Sefrou they were able to defeat and kill the Idrisid Ali ibn Umar and occupy Fes. His brother Yahya was able to retake the city in 880 and establish himself as the new ruler. The Idrisids attacked the Kharijis of Barghawata and Sijilmasa, and the Sunnis of Nekor multiple times, but were never able to include these territories in their state. In 917 the Miknasa and its leader Masala ibn Habus, acting on behalf of their Fatimid allies, attacked Fes and forced Yahya ibn Idris to recognize Fatimid suzerainty, before deposing him in 921. Hassan I al-Hajam managed to wrest control of Fez from 925 until 927 but he was the last of the dynasty to hold power there. From Fes, the Miknasa began a violent hunt across Morocco for members of the Idrisid family, seeking to exterminate them. Most of the Idrisids settled among the Jbala tribes in North-west Morocco where they were protected by the reluctance of tribal elders to have the local descendants of Muhammad's family be wiped out. In the Jbala region they had a stronghold in the fortress of Hajar an-Nasar, from where they tried to restore their power base, until the last Idrisid made the mistake of switching allegiances back to the Fatimids, and was deposed and executed in 985 by the Cordobans.

Story  His father, Gustav, was an architect who built a number of hotels in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived with his wife, Anna. Gustav's success left the family well-off financially and influenced Gottschalk's interest in film. After Gottschalk graduated with a degree in theater and arts from Carleton College in Minnesota, he moved to California to become a filmmaker. He bought an interest in a camera shop and later got to know a nearby outfit that made underwater filming equipment for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Equipment restrictions at the time made wide-angle filming difficult, and Gottschalk began experimenting with anamorphic lens equipment patented by Henri Chr√©tien. In 1953, the CinemaScope process, based on Chr√©tien's patents, was purchased and named by 20th Century Fox. While the camera lenses were now available, the process required projection lenses as well. Gottschalk teamed up with several colleagues and began offering projection lenses under the name Panavision, which used prismatic rather than cylindrical optics. This led to a successful expansion into lenses for cameras which are still widely used.Bijl, Adriaan. The Importance of Panavision: \\"The Invention Phase\\".

However, on the August 24 show, despite contentions by the judges that she had her best performance so far on the show, she received the fewest votes and was sent home. During her stay on the show, she was the center of some discussion over voting patterns, with some claiming that she benefited from regional voting, which is assumed to work to the advantage of candidates from Atlantic Canada. On the other hand, her supporters pointed to one episode of the show where there had been a glitch in the Aliant telephone system which kept much of New Brunswick from voting that night, yet she still placed in the top half. (New Brunswick accounts for less than 3% of the Canadian population.) Arguments over regional voting have been a staple of discussion since the inception of Canadian Idol and have continued into the 2006 season, with some believing that Brandon Jones from New Brunswick and Craig Sharpe from Newfoundland have benefited from regional voting. Candidates who have been assumed to benefit from regional voting have also been high on the list of those targeted by the web site, Vote for the Worst.

Click to enlarge. Potassium-sparing diuretics refers to drugs that cause diuresis without causing potassium loss in the urine and leading to hyperkalemia. They are typically used as an adjunct in management of hypertension, cirrhosis, and congestive heart failure. The steroidal aldosterone antagonists can also be used for treatment of primary hyperaldosteronism. Spironolactone, a steroidal aldosterone antagonist, is also used in management of female hirsutism and acne from PCOS or other causes. Types of Potassium-Sparing Diuretics * Epithelial sodium channel blockers: ** Amiloride - better tolerated than triamterene ** Triamterene - increased renal side-effects * Aldosterone antagonists, also known as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: ** Spironolactone - most widespread use, inexpensive ** Eplerenone - more selective so reduced side-effects but more expensive and less potent ** Finerenone - non-steroidal, more selective and potent than spironolactone and eplerenone ** Canrenone - very limited use Mechanism of action Normally, sodium is reabsorbed in the collecting tubules of a renal nephron. This occurs via epithelial sodium channels or ENaCs, located on luminal surface of principal cells that line the collecting tubules. Positively-charged Na+ entering the cells during reabsorption leads to an electronegative luminal environment causing the secretion of potassium (K+) into the lumen/ urine in exchange. Sodium reabsorption also causes water retention. When the kidneys detect low blood pressure, the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS) is activated and eventually aldosterone is secreted. Aldosterone binds to aldosterone receptors (mineralocorticoid receptors) increasing sodium reabsorption in an effort to increase blood pressure and improve fluid status in the body. When excessive sodium reabsorption occurs, there is increasing loss of K+ in the urine and can lead to clinically significant decreases, termed hypokalemia. Increased sodium reabsorption also increases water retention. Potassium-sparing diuretics act to prevent sodium reabsorption in the collecting tubule by either binding ENaCs (amiloride, triamterene) or by inhibiting aldosterone receptors (spironolactone, eplerenone). This prevents excessive excretion of K+ in urine and decreased retention of water, preventing hypokalemia. Because these diuretics are weakly natriuretic, they do not cause clinically significant blood pressure changes and thus, are not used as primary therapy for hypertension. They can be used in combination with other anti-hypertensives or drugs that cause hypokalemia to help maintain a normal range for potassium. For example, they are often used as an adjunct to loop diuretics (usually furosemide) to treat fluid retention in congestive heart failure and ascites in cirrhosis. Adverse effects On their own this group of drugs may raise potassium levels beyond the normal range, termed hyperkalemia, which risks potentially fatal arrhythmias. Triamterene, specifically, is a potential nephrotoxin and up to half of the patients on it can have crystalluria or urinary casts.780069 Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia, menstrual abnormalities, impotence, and decreased libido by binding non-selective estrogen and progesterone receptors. Other diuretics While not classically considered potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are anti-hypertensive drugs with diuretic effects that decrease renal excretion of potassium. They work by inhibiting either the production (ACEis) or effects (ARBs) of angiotensin 2. This results in a decrease in aldosterone release, which causes potassium- sparing-diuretic-like effects similar to those of the aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone.

Personal life and education Esau was born on April 3, 1898 in Yekaterinoslav, Russian Empire (now Dnipro, Ukraine) to a family of Mennonites of German descent, so-called \\"Russian Mennonites\\".\\"Dr. Esau's family is Mennonite. Dr. Esau's great-grandfather Aron Esau immigrated to the Ukraine in 1804 from Prussia.\\" Evert, Ray F. (October 1985) \\"Katherine Esau: address given by President-Elect Ray F. Evert, University of Wisconsin\\" Plant Science Bulletin 31(5): She began studying agriculture in Moscow, but after a year her family was prompted by the Bolshevik Revolution to move to Germany where she completed her studies at the Agricultural College of Berlin. The Esau family moved to California in 1922, where Esau worked for the Spreckels Sugar Company on sugar beet resistance to curly top virus. She resumed her education at the University of California, Davis, where she achieved her doctorate in 1931, joined the faculty, and remained until her retirement at age 67. Esau died on 4 June 1997 in Santa Barbara, California, USA. Career Esau was a pioneering plant anatomist and her books Plant Anatomy (1953) and Anatomy of Seed Plants (1977) were key plant structural biology texts for four decades. Her early work in plant anatomy focused on the effect of viruses on plants, specifically on plant tissue and development. Esau worked at the University of California, Davis as a teacher and later a professor of Botany. While teaching, she continued her research on viruses and specifically phloem, the food conducting tissue in plants. In the 1950s, she collaborated with botanist Vernon Cheadle on more phloem research. Her treatise The Phloem (1969) was published as Volume 5 of the Handbuch der Pflanzenanatomie. This volume has been recognized as the most important of the series and was a definitive source of information about phloem. In 1963, she was promoted to full professor at Davis. After retiring from the University of California, Davis, she moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965, and continued research well into her 90s, publishing a total of 162 articles and five books. When asked by Elga Wasserman to reflect on her education and career, Esau wrote in 1973 that scientific activities dominated her career and added, \\"I found ways of maintaining spiritual independence while adjusting myself to established policies. . . . I have never felt that my career was being affected by the fact that I am a woman.\\" Recognition She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949. In 1951 she was President of the Botanical Society of America. In 1956 the Botanical Society of America awarded her a Certificate of Merit in its Golden Jubilee celebrations. In 1957, she was the sixth woman elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1962 she was awarded an honorary degree by Mills College, Oakland. In 1989, President George Bush awarded Esau the National Medal of Science. Legacy Many of Esau's publications are housed and available for loan from the Cornelius Herman Muller library at the University of California, Santa Barbara's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. In memory of her contributions as a lecturer, author and scientist, the Katherine Esau Award is awarded to the graduate student who presents the best paper in structural and developmental biology at the annual meeting of the Botanical Society of America.

Direct links operate straight to the airport terminal, while other systems require an intermediate use of people mover or shuttle bus. Although airport rail links have been popular solutions in Europe and Japan for decades, only recently have links been constructed in North America, Oceania, and the rest of Asia. Advantages for the rider include faster travel time and easy interconnection with other public transport, while authorities have benefited from less highway and parking congestion, less pollution, and additional business opportunities. Additionally, the links benefit airports by drawing in more passengers via easy access. Mass transit Capital Airport Express, Beijing Subway Toronto's Union Pearson Express links the city centre with the airport, but also has intermediate stations. This has made it a popular premium alternative for local commuters. For airports built within or close to the city limits, extending mass transit urban rail systems like rapid transit or light rail to airport terminals allows full integration with other public transport in the city, and seamless transport to all parts of town. Service frequency will be high, although travel time is a drawback as the services make many intermediate stops before reaching the city center and thus there may not be enough space for the baggage commonly carried by airport- bound passengers. Furthermore, luggage stowing facilities are not commonly found on mass transit vehicles as their primary objective is to provide high- capacity transport, as in the Airport & South Line in Sydney, Australia. A common solution involves building a separate people mover from a mass transit station to the airport terminal (see below), often using automated systems, allowing faster travel time and fare discrimination, for instance Orlyval. Because they are solely dedicated to passengers using the airport, luggage stowing facilities are more likely to appear on these systems. The first rapid transit station to connect an airport with a mass transit system was the Berlin U-Bahn's Paradestra√üe station which opened in 1927 as Flughafen (Airport) and was built to provide direct access to Berlin Tempelhof Airport. The connection between Tempelhof Airport and the Berlin U-Bahn at Paradestra√üe was however revoked in 1937 and the preceding station Platz der Luftbr√ºcke was instead granted that connection and remained so until Tempelhof Airport's closure in 2008. Other early examples of mass transit stations located at airports include the MBTA Blue Line's Airport station which is situated at Boston's Logan International Airport and opened for service in 1952 and rebuilt in 2004, and Cleveland RTA Rapid Transit Red Line's Cleveland Hopkins International Airport station which opened in 1968 and rebuilt in 1994, although Cleveland's rapid transit is considered the first direct airport-to- downtown rapid transit system in the Western Hemisphere. Boston's Blue Line requires a short bus transfer from the airport rail station to the airport terminal. Mainline rail Frankfurt Airport long-distance station Dedicated railway lines to airports have become popular since the 1980s. In many cases, there are stations at the airport terminal(s) for express, intercity and commuter trains, allowing direct travel to the check-in halls. In most cases, this solution requires the building of new track, whether it is a newly built main line or a branch (spur) line from an existing main line. A cheaper option is to open a new station on an existing line, again connected to the airport by people mover or shuttle bus (see below). While this option is commonly chosen to reduce construction costs, it is only feasible when the station is located within proximity to the airport itself. Some early examples of mainline rail stations built to serve an airport are Don Mueang Station (which opened in 1898 in Don Mueang District and which happens to be located opposite Don Mueang International Airport opened for commercial flights in 1924), Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Flughafen station (which opened in 1951 and serves Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport), Gatwick Airport railway station (of which its first incarnation was opened in 1891 to serve a nearby racecourse and was later rebuilt to directly serve Gatwick Airport in 1958), Brussels National Airport railway station (which opened in 1958 and serves Brussels Airport) and Frankfurt Airport regional station (which opened in 1972 and is one of the two railway stations that serve Frankfurt Airport). Integration with intercity services has produced alliances where airlines sell air tickets that include the connecting rail service. Central Europe has seen integration of high-speed rail into airports, with domestic and international TGV and ICE services from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Frankfurt Airport. Because of this, many airport railway stations have received IATA codes. Yet another option for airports is to use a high-speed \\"airport express\\" train to the city centre, especially if the airport is outside the urban area and some way from the mass transit system, but a direct downtown service is required, such as Flytoget serving Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. There are various ways this can be done: it may operate on a combination of existing and newly built mainline rail or mass transit track using a dedicated fleet of rolling stock designed for airport service. These solutions often have the drawback of lower frequencies (e.g. twice per hour), and often charge a premium fare higher than other services, but are more likely to have luxury features such as luggage racks, power outlets, Wi-Fi, and washrooms. Most dedicated railways use mainline trains and trackage, while mass transit \\"airport express\\" lines are usually found in Asia, as in the case of the Airport Express Line in Hong Kong. Other airports, such as Heathrow Airport, are served by both express trains and mass transit. =Shuttle= In many cases, there is no train station directly at the airport, usually because the infrastructure on which the service operates makes it impractical to build such a station. When this happens, a shuttle system is required for the last part of the journey; using either a people mover (often automated, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City) or a bus. The former allows low operating costs and higher perceived quality; the latter does not require specialized infrastructure to be built, and is often the preferred choice at smaller or low-cost airports. Shuttles do not provide a direct connection, and often involve a wait for a transfer to the next stage of the journey. Thus their market shares are often lower. In some airports, such as San Francisco International Airport, the rail link may not serve some or all of the terminals or concourses directly; passengers using terminals that lack such connections must use a people mover or airport circulator to access their terminal. These circulators typically also serve parking lots, and sometimes airport hotels and off-site car rental locations. Connection types =One-seat ride via main-line train= Commuter rail-type service directly from a city centre to the airport, without needing to change trains and sometimes without intermediate stops.

At the airport train station, the passenger switches to a people mover or other train that goes to the airport terminals. The same system can also serve passengers moving between different terminals and traveling between the terminals and car rental lots or parking areas. Several very large airports have rail stations near some terminals, but people movers are used by many to get to some other terminals. Examples: Paris Charles de Gaulle and Oakland.

The criteria used to judge the acceptability of a test market region or group include: #a population that is demographically similar to the proposed target market; and #relative isolation from densely populated media markets so that advertising to the test audience can be efficient and economical. Practical use The test market ideally aims to duplicate \\"everything\\" - promotion and distribution as well as \\"product\\" - on a smaller scale. The technique replicates, typically in one area, what is planned to occur in a national launch; and the results are very carefully monitored, so that they can be extrapolated to projected national results. The area may be any one of the following: *Television area *Internet online test *Test town *Residential neighborhood *Test site A number of decisions have to be taken about any test market: *Which test market? *What is to be tested? *How long a test? *What are the success criteria? The simple go or no-go decision, together with the related reduction of risk, is normally the main justification for the expense of test markets. At the same time, however, such test markets can be used to test specific elements of a new product's marketing mix; possibly the version of the product itself, the promotional message and media spend, the distribution channels and the price. In this case, several \`matched' test markets (usually small ones) may be used, each testing different marketing mixes. Clearly, all test markets provide additional information in advance of a launch and may ensure that launch is successful: it is reported that, even at such a late stage, half the products entering test markets do not justify a subsequent national launch. However, all test markets do suffer from a number of disadvantages: #Replicability - Even the largest test market is not totally representative of the national market, and the smaller ones may introduce gross distortions. Test market results therefore have to be treated with reservations, in exactly the same way as other market research. #Effectiveness - In many cases the major part of the investment has already been made (in development and in plant, for example) before the \`product' is ready to be test marketed. Therefore, the reduction in risk may be minimal; and not worth the delays involved. #Competitor warning - Test markets can give competitors advance warning of a company's intentions and time to react. They may even be able to go national with their own product before the test is complete. They may also interfere with a test, by changing their promotional activities (usually by massively increasing them) to the extent that results are meaningless. #Cost - Although the main objective of test markets is to reduce the amount of investment put at risk, they may still involve significant costs. It has to be recognized that the development and launch of almost any new product or service carry a considerable element of risk. Indeed, in view of the ongoing dominance of the existing brands, it has to be questioned whether the risk involved in most major launches is justifiable. In a survey of 700 consumer and industrial companies, Booz Allen Hamilton reported an average new product success rate (after launch) of 65 percent; although it had to be noted that only 10 percent of these were totally new products and only 20 per cent new product lines - but these two, highest risk, categories also dominated the \`most successful' new product list (accounting for 60 percent). New product development has therefore to be something of a numbers game. A large number of ideas have to be created and developed for even one to emerge. There is safety in numbers; which once more confers an advantage to the larger organizations. =Risk versus time= Most of the stages of testing, which are the key parts of the new \\"product\\" process, are designed to reduce risk; to ensure that the product or service will be a success. However, all of them take time. In some markets, such as fashion businesses for example, time is a luxury which is not available. The greatest risk here is not having the \\"product\\" available at the right time, and ahead of the competitors. These markets consequently obtain less benefit from the more sophisticated new product processes, and typically do not make use of them at all. When to enter a market with a new product should, in any case, be a conscious decision. In relation to competitors there are two main alternatives: ;Pioneer :Being first into a market carries considerable risks. On the other hand, the first brand is likely to gain a major, leading and ongoing, share of that market in the long term. Pioneering is often the province of the smaller organizations, on a small scale, since their investment can be that much less than that of the majors. ;Latecomer :This offers the reverse strategy. The risk is minimized since the pioneer has already demonstrated the viability of the market. On the other hand, the related reward, that of becoming the market leader, may also be missed. To a certain extent this discussion has now long since been overtaken by events. Japanese corporations led the way in reducing development time dramatically, and even to halving it in the very mature car industry. To quote George Stalk of the Boston Consulting Group: > The effects of this time-based advantage are devastating; quite simply, > American companies are losing leadership of technology and innovation ... > Unless U.S. companies reduce their product development and introduction > cycles from 36-48 months to 12-18 months, Japanese manufacturers will easily > out-innovate and outperform them. Accordingly, the choice to pioneer or to follow no longer exists in a number of industries. The only way for an organization even to survive may be to shorten development times below those of its competitors. =Product replacement= One form of new product launch, which is little discussed, but is probably the most prevalent - and hence most important - of all, is that of replacement of one product by a new one; usually an \\"improved\\" version. The risk levels may be much reduced, since there is an existing user base to underwrite sales (as long as the new product doesn't alienate them - as New Coca-Cola did in the US and New Persil did in the UK). Such an introduction will be complicated by the fact that, at least for some time, there will be two forms of the product in the pipeline. Some firms may opt for a straight cut-over; one day the old product will be coming off the production line, and the next day the new product. Most will favour parallel running for a period of time, even if only because this is forced upon them by their distribution chains. This ensures that the new really does, eventually, replace the old; and it may reveal that both can run together.  Virtual test markets The considerable amounts of time and resources necessary to conduct test markets, restrict the amount of test markets which can be conducted by companies. The risk to reveal a new product design too early is another concern for companies in fast moving and highly competitive markets, which is independent from any cost & time considerations. To overcome these limitations a new type of test markets, so called Virtual Test Markets, was devised. Virtual Test Markets are computer simulations of consumers, companies and the market environment. The technological basis for this kind of test market is a multi-agent system as well as methods from artificial intelligence. In a virtual test market, new products or marketing and distribution strategies can be tested without the risk and time constraints discussed above. Another advantage is the ability to test many different products in one Virtual Test Market as the computer simulation can always be reset to the original situation before the introduction of a new product.

The combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is known as hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene.  Side effects  Common side effects may include a depletion of sodium, folic acid and calcium, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include heart palpitations, tingling/numbness, fever, chills, sore throat, rash, and back pain. Triamterene can also cause kidney stones through direct crystallization or by seeding calcium oxalate stones. Triamterene is best avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the possibility of hyperkalemia. People using this drug should use salt substitute cautiously.LoSalt Advisory Statement (PDF) Triamterene may impart a blue fluorescent color to the urine.  Caution with certain disease states  Diabetes: Use with caution in people with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus as there may be a change in glucose control. Liver impairment: Use with caution in people with severe liver dysfunction; in cirrhosis, avoid electrolyte and acid/base imbalances that might lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Kidney failure: combined triamterene and indomethacin therapy caused reversible acute kidney injury in some people. Kidney stones: Use with caution in people with kidney stones. Use should be avoided if the creatinine clearance is less than 10 ml/minute.  Mechanism of action  Triamterene directly blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the lumen side of the kidney collecting tubule. Other diuretics cause a decrease in the sodium concentration of the forming urine due to the entry of sodium into the cell via the ENaC, and the concomitant exit of potassium from the principal cell into the forming urine. Blocking ENaC prevents this from happening. Amiloride works in the same way. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels.  With hydrochlorothiazide  Triamterene is commonly prepared in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (water retention). This combination is in a class of medications called diuretics or 'water pills', and causes the kidneys to get rid of the body's unneeded water and sodium through the urine.\\"Triamterene and Hydrochlorothiazide\\". MedlinePlus. U.S. National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health. September 1, 2008. History The triamterene ring system is found in many naturally occurring compounds, such as folic acid and riboflavin. The observation that the naturally occurring compound xanthopterin had renal affects led scientists at Smith Kline and French Laboratories in Philadelphia to begin a medicinal chemistry campaign to discover potential drugs, as part of a program to discover potassium-sparing diuretics. The first clinical studies were published in 1961 and the first trials combining it with hydrochlorothiazide were published the next year. Smith Kline & French launched it as a single agent under the brand Dyrenium in 1964. The combination drug with hydrochlorothiazidem, Dyazide, was first approved in the US in 1965 and the first generic, brought by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., was approved in 1987.FDA Approval History NDA 016042: Dyazide. Page accessed Sept 8 2016Ron Wolf for The Philadelphia Inquirer. August 22, 1987 Smithkline Loses Exclusive Rights To Drug In 1986 Dyazide was the most prescribed drug in the US and had $325 million in sales, making it SmithKline Beckman's second- biggest seller behind Tagamet. The patents had expired on Dyazide in 1980, but complications arose with the introductions of generics, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent. Bolar Pharmaceutical was in the running to be the first to bring a generic, but its application was delayed by these concerns about whether its formulation provided the same amount of each drug; these were complicated by accusations that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA. Shortly after Bolar's generic was approved, further concerns were raised with regard to Bolar's applications to market generics more generally; these findings among others raised widespread concern among doctors and the public over whether generics were really the same as branded drugs. Bolar ended up recalling its generic form of Dyazide and withdrawing the product in 1990. In 1991 the US Justice Department on behalf of the FDA filed 20 criminal charges against Bolar for its fraud, and early the next year Bolar pled guilty and agreed to pay a $10M fine. Public concern over the safety of generic drugs was further exacerbated by a Congressional investigation into bribery at the FDA by generics companies that found pervasive corruption; the investigation had been spurred by the generics company Mylan, which had hired private investigators based on its beliefs that competitors were getting unfair advantages in getting their generics approved. Mylan itself developed a version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug after the Dyazide patent expired, and used a different, more stable formulation as well as different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene) so it had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.FDA Approval History NDA 019129: Maxzide Page accessed Sept 8, 2016Pink Sheet Oct 22, 1984 Mylan's Maxzide is \\"Approvable\\" at FDA: Lederle To Market Brand Competition to Smithkline's No. 3-Ranked Dyazide; Final Approval Anticipated \\"Imminently\\" The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983. Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition and litigation by two of them, American Therapeutics Inc. and Vitarine Pharmaceuticals, with the FDA. Vitarine, along with Par Pharmaceutical, were two of the companies that Mylan had targeted in its investigation into corruption and it turned out that Par and Vitarine had each used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain its bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product. Generics eventually entered the market.Drugs.com Generic Maxzide Page accessed Sept 8 2016  Research  While there is a lack of randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of triamterene in the treatment of M√©ni√®re's disease, the typical treatment is 37.5 mg of triamterene with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide 1‚Äì2 capsules daily.

It is one of two official repositories for the now-eradicated smallpox virus, and was part of the system of laboratories known as the Biopreparat. Recently the facility has been upgraded and secured using modern cameras, motion sensors, fences, and biohazard containment systems. Its relative seclusion makes security an easier task. Since its inception there has been an army regiment guarding the facility. The facility has, at least in Soviet times, been a nexus for biological warfare research (see Soviet biological weapons program), though the nature of any ongoing research in this area is uncertain. History Organized in 1974, the center has a long history of virology, making impressive Soviet contribution to smallpox research.

He was best known for his television work on Most Haunted, broadcast on Living TV (2002‚Äì2010). His career as a medium was punctuated by allegations of fakery and he also attracted controversy over a number of seances during which he, reportedly, made contact with high-profile figures. Before his career as a medium, Acorah played as a footballer, where he was once on the books on Liverpool, but his career was cut short by injury. Early life and football career Acorah was born Derek Francis Johnson, in Bootle on 27 January 1950 to Frederick Johnson and Elizabeth Courtney. He lived in Scarisbrick near Southport, in North West England. Acorah claimed that his first experience with spiritualism happened when he was six, when he saw his deceased grandfather in his grandmother's house. His grandmother, a psychic, would later influence his decision to become a medium. Acorah attended secondary school at Warwick Bolam, and was a keen footballer in his youth, firstly playing for Bootle Boys and then, Wrexham's academy side when he was thirteen. He signed schoolboy terms with Liverpool, at the time managed by Bill Shankly. Acorah often told of a story where he told Emlyn Hughes to be careful with his new car. When Hughes turned up late for training the next day, having written the car off, Shankly had heard of Acorah's mediumship and told him, \\"Son, where did you get all this from? You leave that at home, you just bring your boots here and play football.\\" Acorah also claimed that he had spoken to Shankly in the spirit world, in the years following the Scotsman's death. Acorah never made an appearance for the first team, and briefly turned out for the reserves, before being released by his hometown club. He returned to Wrexham, where he played for about a season, and had stints for Glentoran and Stockport County. After the birth of his son, he was asked by the player's union in Manchester if he wanted to play in Australia. He discussed the situation with his wife, and they made the move, where he played for USC Lion in the South Australian State League.Acorah, 2004, p. xv. His time at the club was cut short by injury, putting an end to his football career. On top of this, his wife suffered from homesickness, so they returned to England, but they split up soon afterwards. He then began working as a medium, adopting the surname Acorah, which he claimed came from a Dutch ancestor. Career Acorah's first television appearance was on the satellite TV channel Granada Breeze in 1996. During his five years with the channel, he began with Livetime before later appearing weekly on Psychic Livetime. He also appeared on Predictions which started out as a showcase for various studio guests but later became a vehicle for Acorah alone and renamed Predictions with Derek Acorah. In 2002, Acorah also featured in the television series Antiques Ghost Show, and in 2004 he was presented with the Variety Club of Great Britain's Multichannel TV Personality of the Year Award.Celebrity medium Derek Acorah ‚Äì Entertainment ‚Äì getreading ‚Äì Reading Post . getreading (15 April 2010). Retrieved 2012-05-16. =Most Haunted= In July 2001, Acorah joined a new British television programme called Haunting Truths. It was subsequently sold to Living and renamed Most Haunted. He worked on the show for six series. Yvette Fielding, a presenter and executive producer of Most Haunted, initially stated \\"there is no acting on this programme, none whatsoever. Everything you see and you hear is real.\\" However, significant media attention was directed at the show in 2005, after Acorah claimed to channel spirits with names that had allegedly been suggested to him in advance, such as \\"Rik Eedles\\" and \\"Kreed Kafer\\", which are anagrams of \\"Derek Lies\\" and \\"Derek Faker\\" respectively. Speaking in 2006, Fielding said of Acorah: \\"We tell people everything is real, then it turns out he was a fake, so he had to go.\\" His time on the show saw him regularly being parodied, most notably with Shirley Ghostman (portrayed by Marc Wootton), which drew on elements of Acorah and Colin Fry, and Wooton once invaded one of Acorah's shows. He was also parodied by Dawn French on an episode of French and Saunders and by Jon Culshaw on Dead Ringers. =Other appearances= After his 2005 departure from Most Haunted, Acorah filmed a one-off special for LivingTV, Derek Acorah's Quest for Guy Fawkes followed by Derek Acorah's Ghost Towns with Ruggie Media. This programme ran for three series. In 2008, Acorah took part in two series for Sky Real Lives titled Derek Acorah. In July 2006, he made a cameo appearance in the Doctor Who episode \\"Army of Ghosts\\". In November 2009, Acorah featured in Michael Jackson: The Live Seance, in which he was shown on live television attempting to contact the singer's spirit. The programme was named the worst TV programme of 2009 in a poll of more than 9,000 Yahoo! users.

In May 2012, Acorah claimed to have received a psychic message from Madeleine McCann via a 'spirit guide', stating that the child had died some time ago but would soon be reincarnated. After widespread media outrage, Acorah used the same newspaper to publish an apology to McCann's parents. In December 2015, Acorah, alongside Sean Reynolds and Rebecca Palmer, launched their new 12-part television show entitled The Past Hunters. Acorah competed in the twentieth series of Celebrity Big Brother. He left the house on the final night in fourth place.  Personal life  Acorah was firstly married to Joan Hughes from 1972 to 1982.

The two attacks occurred twelve days apart in December 1811, in homes located half a mile apart near the London Docklands district of Wapping, London, England, United Kingdom. The main suspect in the slayings, John Williams, committed suicide before he could be put on trial. First attack The first attack took place on 7 December 1811 in the living quarters behind a linen draper's shop at 29 Ratcliffe Highway, on the south side of the street between Cannon Street Road and Artichoke Hill. Ratcliffe Highway was the old name for a road in the East End of London, now simply called \\"The Highway\\", then one of three main roads leaving the city. The road was in a dangerous and run-down area of seedy businesses, dark alleys and dilapidated tenements. The victims of the first murders were the Marr family. Timothy Marr, whose age was reported as either 24 or 27, had previously served several years with the East India Company (EIC) aboard the trading ship Dover Castle, and now kept a linen draper's and hosier's shop. Marr had a young wife, Celia; a 14-week-old son, Timothy (who had been born on 29 August); an apprentice, James Gowan; and a servant girl, Margaret Jewell. All had been living at 29 Ratcliffe Highway since April of that year. Newspaper sketch of the Marr mercer shop and residence Just before midnight on 7 December 1811, the Marrs were in their shop and residence preparing for the next day's business when an intruder entered their home. 7 December fell on a Saturday, then pay day for many British working people and the busiest day of the week for shopkeepers. Jewell was not present at 29 Ratcliffe Highway because she had just been sent to purchase oysters as a late-night meal for Marr and a treat for his young wife, who was still recovering from childbirth. Jewell was then to go to a nearby bakery at John Hill and pay an outstanding bill. One report stated that as she opened the shop door she saw the figure of a man framed in the light.De Quincey, Thomas. On Murder considered as one of the Fine Arts. No other contemporary accounts support this statement. As the entire area was usually busy after normal business hours, Jewell took no notice and went on with her errand. Finding the oyster shop closed, she walked back past the Marrs' home, where she saw her employer through the window, still at work, and went to pay the baker's bill. Finding the baker's closed, Jewell decided to go to another shop in a final attempt to find some oysters, but, after finding that shop shuttered as well, she returned empty-handed. Arriving at the shop at twenty minutes past midnight, Jewell found the building dark and the door locked. Thinking that the Marrs had forgotten that she was still out, she knocked, but received no answer. Jewell initially heard no movement inside, then a noise that sounded like footsteps on the stairs, so she assumed that someone was coming to let her in. She heard the baby upstairs cry out. However, no one came to the door. Hearing footsteps on the pavement behind her, Jewell became frightened and slammed the knocker against the door \\"with unintermitting violence\\", drawing attention to herself. George Olney, a night watchman who called out the time every half-hour, came to find out who she was. Olney, who knew the Marrs well, knocked at the door and called out, but noticed that the shutters were in place yet were not latched. The noise awakened John Murray, a pawnbroker and Marr's next-door neighbour. Alarmed, he jumped over the wall that divided his yard from 29 Ratcliffe Highway, and saw a light on and the back door standing open. Murray entered and went up the back steps, calling to the Marrs that they had neglected to fasten their shutters. He heard nothing. Returning downstairs and entering the shop, Murray beheld \\"the carnage of the night stretched out on the floor\\". The \\"narrow premises ... so floated with gore that it was hardly possible to escape the pollution of blood in picking out a path to the front door.\\" He first saw Gowan, the apprentice, lying on the floor about five feet from the stairs, just inside the shop door. The bones of the boy's face were smashed, his blood was dripping onto the floor, and his brains had been pulverised and cast about the walls and across the counters. Murray went to the front door to let Olney in, but stumbled across another corpse, that of Celia Marr. She lay face down, her head battered, her wounds still emitting blood. Murray let in Olney and together they searched for Timothy Marr. They found him behind the shop counter, battered to death. Murray and Olney rushed to the living quarters, and found the infant dead in his crib, which was covered with blood. One side of the infant's face had been crushed and his throat had been slit so that his head was nearly severed from his body. By the time Murray and Olney discovered the infant, more people from the neighbourhood had gathered outside and the Thames River Police were summoned. The first officer on the scene was Charles Horton. As nothing appeared to have been taken money was in the till and ¬£152 was found in a drawer in the bedroom there seemed to be no motive. A thief might have been scared off before he finished, but the other possibility was some sort of revenge attack by someone who knew Timothy Marr. Horton initially believed that the weapon used had been a ripping chisel. One was found in the shop, but it was clean. In the bedroom he found a heavy, long-handled shipwright's hammer, or maul, covered with blood, leaning against a chair. Horton assumed this was the murder weapon, abandoned when Jewell's knocking scared the killer away. Human hairs were stuck in the drying blood on the flat, heavy end, and the tapered end, used for driving nails into wood, was chipped. Contemporary newspaper illustration of the pen maul used in the first murders, showing the initials \\"IP\\" or \\"JP\\" Two sets of footprints were then discovered at the back of the shop. These appeared to belong to the killers, as they contained both blood and sawdust from carpentry work done inside earlier in the day. A group of citizens followed the tracks to Pennington Street, which ran behind the house, and found a possible witness who reported that he had seen a group of some ten men running away from an empty house in the direction of New Gravel Lane (now Glamis Road) shortly after the alarm had been raised. Speculation now arose that the crime was the work of a criminal gang. Horton took the bloodstained maul back to his station to find that three sailors, who had been seen in the area that night, were in custody. One appeared to have spots of blood on his clothing, but all three had convincing alibis and were released. Other men were apprehended in the area on the basis of witnesses' reports, but the cases against them also fell apart. A reward of 50 guineas was offered for the apprehension of the perpetrator, and, to notify area residents, a handbill was drafted and stuck on church doors. Reward notice for ¬£50 for information regarding the Marr murders. James Gowan, Marr's apprentice, is misidentified as \\"Biggs\\". Investigation On 10 December a coroner's jury heard that someone must have been watching the shop and residence for an opportunity. The crime had been committed between 11:55 p.m., when Jewell left, and 12:20 a.m., when she returned. Murray stated that he had heard bumping noises around 12:10 a.m., so it was decided that the killers had still been in the home when Jewell returned and had fled out the back door. The Marr funeral procession on Sunday, 15 December 1811 An attempt was made to trace the maul by the chip in its blade. There was no blood on the chisel, but since Jewell stated that Marr had been looking for one earlier that evening, it was thought that it was brought to be used as a weapon, since if it had been in plain sight, he would have found it. Cornelius Hart, one of the carpenters who had worked in the shop that day, was detained, but no case could be made against him and he was released. Marr's brother also came under scrutiny, since he was rumoured to have had a disagreement with him, but after being interrogated for forty-eight hours, he was exonerated because he had a firm alibi. A servant girl who had previously been let go was also questioned, but she lacked motive as well as criminal companions, and was too small to have performed the murders by herself. The four victims were given a memorial service, then buried beneath a monument in the parish church of St. George in the East, where the infant had been baptised three months earlier. When the maul was cleaned on Thursday 19 December it appeared that some initials were carved into the handle, perhaps with a seaman's coppering punch: \\"I.P.\\" or \\"J.P.\\" Those who were working on the case now had a way to try to trace the owner. Second attack The same night the initials were discovered on the maul, and twelve days after the first killings, the second set of murders occurred at The King's Arms, a tavern at 81 New Gravel Lane (now Garnet Street). The victims were John Williamson, the 56-year-old publican, who had run the tavern for fifteen years; Elizabeth, his 60-year-old wife; and their servant, Bridget Anna Harrington, who was in her late 50s. The King's Arms was a tall two-storey building, but despite its proximity to the Highway it was not a rowdy establishment, as the Williamsons liked to retire early. Earlier that night Williamson had told one of the parish constables that he had seen a man wearing a brown jacket lurking around the place and listening at his door. He asked the officer to keep an eye out for the stranger and arrest him. Not long afterwards the same constable heard a cry of, \\"Murder!\\" As a crowd gathered outside The King's Arms a nearly naked man descended from the upper floor using a rope of knotted sheets. As he dropped to the street, he was crying incoherently. He was John Turner, a lodger and journeyman who had been at the tavern for some eight months. Newspaper illustration of the escape of John Turner from the second murder scene at the King's Arms. The crowd forced the tavern doors open and saw the body of John Williamson lying face up on the steps leading into the taproom. His head had been beaten and his throat had been cut, and there was an iron crowbar lying at his side. While the crowbar appeared to be the weapon used to beat him, a sharper implement had been used to slit his throat and nearly hack off his hand. Elizabeth Williamson and the maid were found in the parlour, their skulls smashed and their throats cut. The maid's feet were beneath the grate, as if she had been struck down while preparing the fire for the next morning. Her mistress's neck had been severed to the bone. The crowd armed themselves and stormed through the inn in search of possible perpetrators. They then discovered the Williamsons' 14-year-old granddaughter, Catherine Stillwell, in her bed, alive and untouched. Given what had happened to the Marr family twelve days earlier, it seemed miraculous that she had slept through the entire attack and had no idea what had just occurred downstairs. The bodies were placed on their beds and the girl was taken to a safer home. Fire bells were rung to call out volunteers, while London Bridge was sealed off. Acting on eyewitness accounts that a tall man had been loitering outside the tavern that night, wearing a flushing coat (a loose-fitting, hooded garment), several Bow Street Runners were assigned to hunt down the murderer. According to one report, Turner claimed that he had shouted for help, scaring the killer away. He also reportedly stated that he had seen the tall man near Mrs Williamson's corpse, but he was also viewed as a suspect and his report was not given its full weight. Entry to the premises was found to have been gained by forcing open the cellar flap. An open window was discovered, with bloodstains on the sill indicating the murderer's escape route, and a footprint in the mud outside seemed to confirm this. The unknown assailant apparently escaped by running along a clay-covered slope, so it was assumed by the police that he would have got clay all over his clothing, making him easy to identify. It was pointed out that this type of escape route was similar to the one taken by the person who had murdered the Marr family. There were no known connections between the two families, and there was also no apparent motive for this second slaughter. As Mr Williamson's watch was missing and both crimes had been interrupted, they might still have started off as simple robberies. A haphazard task force was assembled, composed of constables from various parishes and a group of Bow Street Runners. They quickly arrested a suspect who lived in the area, had recently purchased a gallon of brandy and had recently cleaned trousers to get rid of what a local doctor claimed were bloodstains. No forensic tests existed to test his theory, but the man was detained anyway. Other witnesses claimed that they had seen two men running up Ratcliff Highway that night, a tall man with a limp and a shorter man, but the descriptions were vague and did not result in any clear leads. Local magistrates convened and quickly offered another reward of 100 guineas, double the amount of the reward in the case of the Marr family, for information leading to the capture of the culprit, and handbills were drafted and posted within the hour. Rewards were offered by three different parishes for information, including two other offers of ¬£50. Survivor's testimony Richard Ryder, the Home Secretary, responded to public panic and pressure and appointed Aaron Graham, a Bow Street magistrate, to the inquiry. London newspapers focused on the crimes for some three weeks, and a coroner's inquest was called at The Black Horse, a tavern across from The King's Arms. Turner claimed that he had entered The King's Arms at about 10:40 on the night of 19 December and had gone to his room on the upper floor. He had heard Mrs Williamson lock the door, then heard the front door bang open \\"hard\\" and Bridget shout, \\"We are all murdered!\\". Williamson then exclaimed, \\"I am a dead man.\\" As he lay in bed listening, Turner heard several blows. He also heard someone walking about, but so quietly that he believed their shoes had no nails. (The shoe print outside was made by a shoe with nails.) After a few minutes he left his bed and went to investigate. As Turner crept down the stairs, he heard three drawn-out sighs and saw that a door stood open, with a light shining on the other side. He peered in and caught a glimpse of a man he estimated was six feet tall, wearing a dark flushing coat, leaning over Mrs Williamson and going through her pockets. Turner saw only one man before going back up the stairs. Rather than become a victim as well, he then tied two sheets together in his bedroom and lowered himself out of the house. He knew that Mr Williamson's watch was missing and described it, but could not recall there ever being a crowbar in the tavern like the one found next to the corpse. The conclusion was that it must have been brought there by the killer. Those who had seen the corpses testified and the surgeon who had examined them also gave his report. The jury returned a verdict of willful murder by a person or persons unknown. Suspect A principal suspect in the murders, John Williams (also known as John Murphy), was a 27-year-old Irish or Scottish seaman and a lodger at The Pear Tree, a public house on Cinnamon Street off the Highway in Old Wapping. Williams' roommate had noticed that he had returned after midnight on the night of the tavern murders. Thomas de Quincey claimed that Williams had been an acquaintance of Timothy Marr, and described him as: \\"a man of middle stature, slenderly built, rather thin but wiry, tolerably muscular, and clear of all superfluous flesh. His hair was of the most extraordinary and vivid colour, viz., a bright yellow, something between an orange and a yellow colour\\". The Times was more specific: he was five-foot- nine, slender, had a \\"pleasing countenance,\\" and did not limp. Williams had nursed a grievance against Marr from when they were shipmates, but the subsequent murders at The King's Arms remain unexplained. The Shadwell Police Office examined Williams as well as several other suspects. Williams had two pawn tickets on his person, some silver coins and a pound note. His last voyage had been on Roxburgh Castle, an EIC trading ship, and he had narrowly escaped being part of a failed mutiny attempt. Williams was educated and had a reputation for being honest, as he always paid for his rooms, and was popular with women. He had been seen drinking with at least one other man at The King's Arms shortly before the murders, so he was subjected to an intense interrogation. Williams was of medium height and slight build, so his description in no way matched Turner's description of a large man in a dark flushing coat. He said that he had never denied being at The King's Arms that evening, but the Williamsons considered him a family friend. Mrs Williamson had even touched his face that night in a motherly gesture. What aroused suspicion was Williams' earlier mention that he had no money, although he was seen to have some after the murders. He claimed that he had pawned articles of clothing afterwards, offering the pawn tickets as proof, and that after he had left the tavern that evening he had consulted a surgeon about an old wound, as well as a woman with some knowledge of medicine. No one investigated this alibi or checked the dates on the pawn tickets. Despite his insistence that he was innocent, Williams was remanded to Coldbath Fields Prison, also known as the Clerkenwell Gaol, where another suspect was also incarcerated. The police were still not sure how many men were involved and confined three suspects in all. Break in the case On 24 December, more than two weeks after the Marr family had been murdered and five days after the killing of the Williamson family, the maul was identified as belonging to a sailor named John Petersen, who was away at sea. The information was volunteered by a Mr Vermiloe, the landlord of The Pear Tree, who was incarcerated in Newgate Prison for debt. Constables searched the premises and found Petersen's trunk, which was missing a maul. Vermiloe recalled that not only had the maul been in the chest, but that he himself had used it and was responsible for chipping it. That was a significant lead. It has been noted that the substantial reward money for information leading to the arrest of the murderers would have cleared Vermiloe's debts. Before an open forum of witnesses that day, Turner was asked if he could identify Williams as the man he had seen standing over Mrs Williamson. He could not, but did state that he knew Williams from earlier visits to the tavern. Williams's laundress was called to see if she had washed any bloody clothing. She said that two weeks earlier she had noticed that one of his shirts was torn and that another that had blood on the collar, as if from bloody fingers. She assumed that Williams had been in a fight. She had not washed any clothing for him since before the Williamsons were murdered. Williams claimed that the torn and bloodstained shirts were the result of a brawl after a card game, but he was silenced by the magistrates and returned to prison. The facts in evidence against Williams were that he had had an opportunity to take the maul, that he had money after the murders but not before, that he had returned to his room just after the killer had fled the second crime scene, and that he had had bloody and torn shirts. Although an attempt was made to identify the maul and ascertain whether any of Williams's shirts had blood stains on them, the courts could not assess forensic evidence and gave great weight to eyewitnesses' statements. Suicide Williams never went to trial. On 28 December he used his scarf to hang himself from an iron bar in his cell. No one discovered this until just before he was to be taken for another hearing before the Shadwell magistrates. An officer announced to the court that the accused was dead and that his body was cold. Williams' suicide surprised everyone who had spoken to him. Several prisoners and a warden said that he had appeared to be in good spirits only the day before, believing that he would soon be exonerated and released. This led to later speculation that Williams was murdered to prevent authorities from looking elsewhere. The hearing continued despite the dead man's inability to defend himself. The Times reported that a secret prison correspondence had been discovered between Williams and one of the other suspects, \\"which clearly connects them with the shocking transactions\\". Another man who had shared the room at The Pear Tree with Williams said that he had found his own stockings muddied and hidden behind a chest, and concluded that Williams had worn his stockings out that night and got them dirty. He claimed that after he confronted Williams he immediately took them into the yard and washed them. Their landlady confirmed these statements and added that, while the stockings were quite muddy, she had also seen blood on them. She explained that she had not told anyone about this before Williams's death because she feared that he might kill her. A female witness who knew Williams well connected him with a chisel that was proved to have been taken from the same seaman's chest as the maul. The court finally declared Williams guilty of the crimes, taking his suicide as a clear statement of his guilt. The cases against other suspects collapsed and, although Williams had not previously been connected with the murders of the Marr family, he was deemed the sole perpetrator of both. Burial procession of John William [sic], showing the cart stopping before the King's Arms. The Home Secretary was more than happy to agree with the opinion of the bench, and decided that the best way to end the matter was to parade Williams's body through Wapping and Shadwell so that the residents could see that while he had \\"cheated the hangman\\", he was indeed dead and no longer a menace. The Thames River Police, the Bow Street Mounted Patrol, and local constables and watchmen were ordered to oversee the event. On New Year's Eve, Williams's body was removed from the prison at 11 a.m., with \\"an immense concourse of persons\\", said to total 180,000, taking part in a procession up the Ratcliffe Highway. When the cart carrying the body drew opposite the Marr family house, the procession halted for nearly a quarter of an hour. A drawing was made that shows, not the slender man described in newspaper accounts, but a stocky labourer. In his pocket was a piece of metal that he had apparently ripped from the prison wall to stab himself with, in the event that he was unsuccessful at hanging himself. Sketch of John Williams' corpse on the death cart, along with the murder implements of pen maul, ripping chisel and iron crowbar. This representation of a stocky labourer was published 4 years after the event and does not match his physical description, that of a slender man. The date of the first murder is also incorrect. Suicides could not be buried in consecrated ground. The stake was meant to keep the restless soul from wandering, while the crossroads were meant to confuse whatever evil ghost arose from the grave. In addition, the grave was deliberately made too small for the body, so that the murderer would feel uncomfortable even in death. Quicklime was added and the pit was covered over. The procession also stopped for ten minutes in front of The King's Arms, where the coachman reportedly whipped the dead man three times across the face. In August 1886, a gas company began to excavate a trench in the area where Williams had been buried. They accidentally unearthed a skeleton, reportedly buried upside down and with the remains of the wooden stake through its torso. \\"It was six feet below the surface of the road where Cannon Street Road and Cable Street cross at St George's in the East.\\" The landlord of The Crown and Dolphin, a public house at the corner of Cannon Street Road, is said to have retained the skull as a souvenir. The pub has since been renovated and the whereabouts of the skull are currently unknown. Some alternative suspects John Williams's arrest would have interested two other people involved: Cornelius Hart and William \\"Long Billy\\" Ablass. * Hart, who had done carpentry work at the Marrs' shop on the day of the murders, claimed to have lost a chisel and made several enquiries about its whereabouts to Marr. Jewell testified that Marr searched his shop that night, but could find no trace of it. When Harriott had visited the shop on the morning after the murders, he found the chisel placed in a prominent position and removed it as evidence. Hart always denied any particular dealings with Williams, although other witnesses provided a link between the two. Following Williams's arrest Hart, enquired at The Pear Tree whether Williams was being retained in custody. * Ablass was a seaman who had sailed with Williams aboard Roxburgh Castle. He had a history of aggressive behaviour and had been involved in the unsuccessful mutiny aboard the ship, and was placed in confinement afterwards, while Williams was thought to have simply been led astray by his shipmates. Ablass was drinking in company with Williams at The King's Arms on the night of the murders, and was a far better match for Turner's description of the killer. He was also lame, matching the earlier eyewitness description of one of the men running up the Highway after the first murders, and was unable to account for some of his time on the nights of both murders. He was detained as a suspect. When evidence emerged that Marr, Williams and Ablass had all served together as seamen before Marr went into business on his own, it was suggested that there were links, and possibly old scores to settle, between the three. Puzzling motivation The motive for the Ratcliff Highway Murders has remained a mystery, and a cause for speculation for detectives and crime buffs. Colin Wilson theorised that Williams was syphilitic and harboured a grudge against humanity. P.D. James and Critchley, however, believe that the proceedings were conducted quickly in order to close the case and appease the frightened public. An early eyewitness insisted that the two men seen on the road outside The King's Arms had spoken, and one had called out what sounded like a name, possibly \\"Mahoney\\" or \\"Hughey\\". Williams's name did not sound like that, but once he was in custody the report was ignored. While Williams had misrepresented himself on occasion and could have been using an alias, following a lead about two men walking up the street together, who were not proved to have had anything to do with the murders, ignored the facts about the open tavern window and the footprint in the mud outside. They believe that it was possible someone else had perpetrated the assaults, making Williams merely a tragic and unfortunate pawn. In January 1812 the authorities still felt a need to prove that Williams had committed the murders. The weapon, either a razor or knife, that was used to cut the throats of the victims, and clearly linked to Williams, became the sought-after piece of evidence. A police officer stated that he had originally found a knife like that in the pocket of Williams's coat, but had not seen it since. Newspaper accounts of this testimony shifted from calling the weapon a razor, which they took from the surgeon's reports, to claiming that the wounds had been clearly made with a sharp knife. Eventually a knife was indeed found, and was said to have blood on it, but whether it had actually belonged to Williams or had been planted in his room to confirm his guilt is still unknown. Media The murders are repeatedly referenced in Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, where Sir William Gull speculates that the murders were a false flag operation of sorts committed by the Freemasons in order to spur on the creation of the modern police force and thus further the organization's authoritarian agenda. The murders provided the backdrop for the first two episodes of the third series of British television drama Whitechapel in 2012. They were also given a fictionalised treatment in Lloyd Shepherd's first novel, The English Monster (2012). The murders are central to the story in David Morrell's thriller, Murder as a Fine Art, published in 2013. The murders are referenced in Alison Goodman's novel, The Dark Days Club, published in 2016. In popular culture The murders and the murderer are analyzed by Thomas de Quincy in his famous essay On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts (1827). The murders and Charles Horton are featured in Lloyd Shepherd‚Äôs historical novel, The English Monster (2012). The murders are featured in Lona Manning‚Äôs historical novel, A Marriage of Attachment (2018). The murders are mentioned (albeit with a supernatural element) in KJ Charles‚Äôs Magpie Lord series. The murders are mentioned in Peter Ackroyd's Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem as a motivation of the murderer. The murders are mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs first Sherlock Holmes novel, A Study in Scarlet. The murders are mentioned in Fergus Hume's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab. The murders are mentioned in G.K. Chesterton's \\"Father Brown\\" stories, The Blue Cross and The Mirror of the Magistrate. The murders are mentioned in the third series ITV's crime drama Whitechapel.

He represented Marin and southern Sonoma counties in the California State Assembly, for three consecutive terms, as a Democrat from 2000 until he was termed out in 2006. When Nation was elected in 2000, his primary opponents were university official Carole Hayashino, future gubernatorial recall candidate Paul Nave, and future Marin County Supervisor Susan Adams. He defeated the Republican candidate, Edward Sullivan, in the general election. According to a study published by the Leadership Institute for Conservative Leaders Who Want to Win,http://pac.leadershipinstitute.org/20032004/detailPAC.cfm?id=C00398248 Nation's campaign received contributions totaling $10,372 from the MICRA Political Action Committee of NorCal Mutual Insurance Company in 2003-2004. Out of 18 candidates (16 Republicans and 2 Democrats) Nation received the highest total from MICRA NorCal, an average of 70% more in donations than most other recipients, including $749 more than the next highest recipient. In 2004 Nation was chosen to be Chair of the Assembly Rules Committee, and he was asked to create and direct the Office of Policy Planning and Research. In 2005, with his term-out looming, Nation challenged 6th Congressional District representative Lynn Woolsey in the primary, and lost. In 2008, he entered the primary for the 3rd Senate District seat, and lost. He teaches climate change policy, health care policy, and public policy at Stanford University. Nation is a former professor of economics at the University of San Francisco and the Monterey Institute of International Studies, where he taught economics, public policy, public finance, and foreign policy.

Portrait by Ferdinand Hartmann Friedrich von Matthisson (23 January 1761 ‚Äì 12 March 1831) was a German poet, an early member of the German Romantic movement. His best known poem is probably Adelaide, which was set to music by Beethoven. Biography He was born at Hohendodeleben near Magdeburg, the son of the village pastor, on 23 January 1761. After studying theology and philology at the university of Halle, he was appointed in 1781 master at the classical school Philanthropinum in Dessau. This once famous seminary was, however, then rapidly decaying in public favor, and in 1784 Matthisson was glad to accept a travelling tutorship. He lived for two years with the Swiss author Bonstetten at Nyon on Lake Geneva. In 1794 he was appointed reader and traveling companion to Princess Louisa of Anhalt- Dessau (wife of Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau). They visited Switzerland, Tyrol, and Italy. For a time, they were joined in their travels by Danish author and salonist Friederike Brun. After Princess Louisa's death in 1811, he entered the service of the king of W√ºrttemberg, was ennobled, created counselor of legation, appointed intendant of the court theatre and chief librarian of the royal library at Stuttgart. He resided for a time in Italy. In 1828 he retired and settled at W√∂rlitz near Dessau, where he died on 12 March 1831. Writings Matthisson enjoyed for a time a great popularity on account of his Poems (; 1787; 15th ed., 1851; new ed., 1876), which Schiller extravagantly praised for their melancholy sweetness and their fine descriptions of scenery. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica praises his verse as melodious and written with musical language, but complains that the thought and sentiments expressed are too often artificial and insincere. The 1905 New International Encyclopaedia judges ‚Äúhis verse melodious and graceful, especially in rural description, but never strong.‚Äù His Adelaide was rendered famous by Beethoven's setting. Of Matthisson's elegies, Elegy in the Ruins of an Old Castle () was still popular in 1911, and is praised by the 1879 American Cyclopaedia as one of his finest lyrics. He edited selections from the lyric poets of Germany under the title of Lyrische Anthologie (20 vols., Z√ºrich, 1803‚Äì07). His Reminiscences (; 5 vols., 1810-1816), contain interesting accounts of his travels. Matthisson's Writings () appeared in eight volumes (1825-1829), of which the first contains his poems and the other seven his Erinnerungen; a ninth volume was added in 1833 containing his biography by Heinrich D√∂ring. His Literary Remains (), with a selection from his correspondence, was published in four volumes by F. R. Schoch in 1832.

It was first published in the New York Herald (February‚ÄìMarch 1891) and Black and White London (March‚ÄìApril 1891). In it, the protagonist buys a bottle with an imp inside that grants wishes. However, the bottle is cursed; if the holder dies bearing it, his or her soul is forfeit to hell. Plot Keawe, a poor Native Hawaiian, buys a strange unbreakable bottle from a sad, elderly gentleman who credits the bottle with his fortune. He promises that an imp residing in the bottle will also grant Keawe his every desire. Of course, there is a catch. The bottle must be sold, for cash, at a loss, i.e. for less than its owner originally paid, and cannot be thrown or given away, or else it will magically return to him. All of these rules must be explained by each seller to each purchaser. If an owner of the bottle dies without having sold it in the prescribed manner, that person's soul will burn for eternity in Hell. The bottle was said to have been brought to Earth by the Devil and first purchased by Prester John for millions; it was owned by Napoleon and Captain James Cook and accounted for their great successes. By the time of the story the price has diminished to fifty dollars. Keawe buys the bottle and instantly tests it by wishing his money to be refunded, and by trying to sell it for more than he paid and abandoning it, to test if the story is true. When these all work as described, he realizes the bottle does indeed have unholy power. He wishes for his heart's desire: a big, fancy mansion on a landed estate, and finds his wish granted, but at a price: his beloved uncle and cousins have been killed in a boating accident, leaving Keawe sole heir to his uncle's fortune. Keawe is horrified, but uses the money to build his house. Having all he wants, and being happy, he explains the risks to a friend who buys the bottle from him. Keawe lives a happy life, but there is something missing. Walking along the beach one night, he meets a beautiful woman, Kokua. They soon fall in love and become engaged. Keawe's happiness is shattered on the night of his betrothal, when he discovers that he has contracted the then-incurable disease of leprosy. He must give up his house and wife, and live in Kalaupapa--a remote community for lepers--unless he can recover the bottle and use it to cure himself. Keawe begins this quest by attempting to track down the friend to whom he sold the bottle, but the friend has become suddenly wealthy and left Hawaii. Keawe traces the path of the bottle through many buyers and eventually finds a Haole of Beritania Street, Honolulu. The man of European ancestry has both good and bad news for Keawe: (a) he owns the bottle and is very willing to sell, but (b) he had only paid two cents for it. Therefore, if Keawe buys it, he will not be able to resell it. Keawe decides to buy the bottle anyway, for the price of one cent, and indeed cures himself. Now, however, he is understandably despondent: how can he possibly enjoy life, knowing his doom? His wife mistakes his depression for regret at their marriage, and asks for a divorce. Keawe confesses to her his secret. His wife suggests they sail, with the bottle, to Tahiti; on that archipelago the colonists of French Polynesia use centimes, a coin worth one fifth of an American cent. This offers a potential recourse for Keawe. When they arrive, however, the suspicious natives will not touch the cursed bottle. Kokua determines to make a supreme sacrifice to save her husband from his fate. Since, however, she knows he would never sell the bottle to her knowingly, Kokua is forced to bribe an old sailor to buy the bottle for four centimes, with the understanding that she will secretly buy it back for three. Now Keawe is happy, but she carries the curse. Keawe discovers what his wife has done, and resolves to sacrifice himself for her in the same manner. He arranges for a brutish boatswain to buy the bottle for two centimes, promising he will buy it back for one, thus sealing his doom. However, the drunken sailor refuses to part with it, and is unafraid of the prospect of Hell. \\"I reckon I'm going anyway,\\" he says. Keawe returns to his wife, both of them free from the curse, and the reader is encouraged to believe that they live happily ever after. Background The theme of the bottle imp can be found in the German legend Spiritus familiaris by the Brothers Grimm as well.85\\\\. Spiritus familiaris. In: Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm: Deutsche Sagen. Zwei B√§nde in einem Band. M√ºnchen 1965, pp. 121-123. At the time of publication in 1891, the currency system of the Kingdom of Hawaii included cent coins that circulated at par with the U.S. penny. The novel reflects Stevenson's impressions gained during his five-month visit of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1889.Robert Louis Stevenson: Travels in Hawaii. edited and with an introduction by A. Grove Day. University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu 1991. Part of the storyline takes place in the little town Ho ªokena at the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, which the author visited.cf. his letter to Charles Baxter (Honolulu, 10 May 1889): \\"I have just been a week away alone on the lee coast of Hawaii, the only white creature in many miles, riding five and a half hours one day, living with a native ...\\" In a scene which takes place in Honolulu Stevenson mentions Heinrich Berger, the bandmaster of the Royal Hawaiian Band.cf. The Bottle Imp: \\"Thither he went, because he feared to be alone; and there, among happy faces, walked to and fro, and heard the tunes go up and down, and saw Berger beat the measure, and all the while he heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burning in the bottomless pit.\\" The name of Keawe's wife refers to the Hawaiian word k≈çkua,Hawaiian Dictionaries which means help. In 1889 Stevenson also visited the leper colony on the island of Moloka ªi and met Father Damien there. Therefore, he had a first-hand experience from the fate of lepers.cf. his letter to Sidney Colvin (Honolulu, June 1889): \\"I am just home after twelve days journey to Molokai, seven of them at the leper settlement, where I can only say that the sight of so much courage, cheerfulness, and devotion strung me too high to mind the infinite pity and horror of the sights.\\" Several times Stevenson uses the Hawaiian word Haole, which is the usual term for Caucasians, for example describing the last owner of the bottle.vgl. The Bottle Imp: \\"Now there was an old brutal Haole drinking with him, one that had been a boatswain of a whaler, a runaway, a digger in gold mines, a convict in prisons.\\" The story could be considered as both a continuation of and a rather light-hearted counterpoint to the theme of selling one's soul to The Devil, manifested in the numerous depictions of Doctor Faust as well as in such stories as \\"The Devil and Tom Walker\\" by Washington Irving and \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" by Stephen Vincent Benet. Publication \\"The Bottle Imp\\" was published in the missionary magazine O le sulu Samoa (The Samoan Torch) in 1891, with the title \\"O Le Tala I Le Fagu Aitu\\". According to Publishers Weekly and School Library Journal (both quoted by Amazon.com) \\"this tale was originally published, in Samoan, in 1891\\".Quoted on the Amazon sales page for the edition with The Locus Online Index to Science Fiction similarly states \\"The Stevenson story was first published in Samoan in 1891, appearing later that year in English.\\" The Project Gutenberg text of the story has a note by Stevenson which says \\"...the tale has been designed and written for a Polynesian audience...\\" which also suggests initial publication in Polynesia, not in the United States. Bottle Imp paradox The premise of the story creates a logical paradox similar to the unexpected hanging paradox. Clearly no rational person would buy it for one cent as this would make it impossible for it to be sold at a loss. However, it follows that no rational person would buy it for two cents either if it is later to be sold only to a rational person for a loss. By backward induction, the bottle cannot be sold for any price in a perfectly rational world. And yet, the actions of the people in the story do not seem particularly unwise. Sorensen calls this \\"Sharvy‚Äôs Bottle Imp paradox\\" or \\"Sharvy‚Äôs paradox\\", see  The story shows that the paradox could be resolved by the existence of certain characters: * Someone who loves the bottle's current owner enough to sacrifice his or her own soul for that person. * Someone who believes he or she is inevitably destined for Hell already. * Someone who believes he or she will never die. * Someone who believes there is someone else willing to make an irrational decision to purchase the bottle. Since the exchange rates of different currencies can fluctuate with respect to one another, it is also possible that the value of the bottle could increase from one transaction to the next even if the stated price decreases. This leads to an endless staircase-type paradox which would make it possible, in theory, for the bottle to keep getting sold infinitely many times. However, this might be forbidden depending on how the bottle imp interprets the idea of \\"selling at a loss\\". Adaptations A poster for the 1917 film A silent film based on Stevenson's story was released in 1917. The screenplay was adapted by Charles Maigne. The film was directed by Marshall Neilan, and starred Sessue Hayakawa, Lehua Waipahu, H. Komshi, George Kuwa, Guy Oliver and James Neill. The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology radio series, adapted the story as \\"The Wonderful Bottle\\" in 1934. K√§the von Nagy was the star in the German film Love, Death and the Devil (1934) and the French film The Devil in the Bottle (1935). A West German stop motion animated feature film based on the story and directed by the Diehl Brothers was released in 1952 under the title Der Flaschenteufel. An Italian TV adaptation \\"Il diavolo nella bottiglia\\" aired on Rai2 on 23 Jun 1981 as part of the horror anthology series \\"I giochi del diavolo\\". The Devil Inside, an opera based on Stevenson's short story written by the novelist Louise Welsh and the composer Stuart MacRae, premiered at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow in January 2016. The opera was a co-production between Scottish Opera and Music Theatre Wales. The story has inspired the trick-taking card game Bottle Imp, designed by G√ºnter Cornett. It was first published in 1995 by Bambus Spieleverlag, and has been republished several times since under the name \\"Bottle Imp\\".

It is commonly dated from the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and contrasted with a later Early Modern Period; the time during which the rise of humanism in the Italian Renaissance and the Reformation unfolded, are generally associated with the transition out of the Middle Ages, with European overseas expansion as a succeeding process, but such dates are approximate and based upon nuanced arguments.  Early Middle Ages  The first waves of Slavic migration settled the area of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present-day southeastern Poland and southern Masovia, coming from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River. Results of a genetic study by researchers from Gda≈Ñsk Medical University \\"support hypothesis placing the earliest known homeland of Slavs in the middle Dnieper basin\\". The West Slavs came primarily from the more western early Slavic branch called the Sclaveni by the Byzantine historian Jordanes in Getica, the eastern branch being the Antes. The Slavs had first migrated into Poland in the second half of the 5th century, some half century after these territories had been vacated by Germanic tribes (after a period during which settlements were absent or rare). According to the references given in this and Poland in the Early Middle Ages article, many scholars now believe that the Slavic tribes had not been present in Poland before the earliest medieval period, though the opposite view, predominant in Polish prehistory and protohistory in the past, is still represented. From there, over the 6th century, the new population dispersed north and west. The Slavs lived mostly by cultivating crops but also engaged in hunting and gathering. Their migrations took place while Eastern and Central Europe were being invaded from the east by waves of peoples and armies such as the Huns, Avars and Magyars. West Slavic tribes in 9th/10th century A number of West Slavic Polish tribes formed small states, beginning in the 8th century, some of which later coalesced into larger states. Among these tribes were the Vistulans (Wi≈õlanie) in southern Poland, with Krak√≥w and Wi≈õlica as their main centers (major fortified centers were built in their country in the 9th century), but later the tribe(s) referred to as the Polans (Polanie‚Äîliterally, \\"people of the fields\\") would prove of decisive historic importance. At the end of the 9th century Vistulans were part of the Great Moravia, according to some theories. The tribal states built many gords ‚Äì fortified structures with earthen and wooden walls and embankments ‚Äì from the 7th century onward. Some of these were developed and inhabited; others featured a large empty space and may have served primarily as refuges in times of trouble. The Polans settled the plains around Giecz, Pozna≈Ñ and Gniezno that would become the early center of Poland and lent their name to the country. They went through a period of accelerated building of gord-type fortified settlements and of territorial expansion, beginning in the first half of the 10th century, and the Polish state developed from their tribal polities in the second half of the 10th century.Jerzy Wyrozumski ‚Äì Dzieje Polski piastowskiej (VIII w. ‚Äì 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century ‚Äì 1370)), Fogra, Krak√≥w 1999, , pp. 47-86 High Middle Ages The Polish state begins with the rule of Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty in the second half of the 10th century. Mieszko chose to be baptized in the Western Latin Rite in 966. Following its emergence, the Polish nation was led by a series of rulers who converted the population to Christianity, created a strong kingdom and integrated Poland into the European culture. Mieszko's son Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry established a Polish Church province, pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned, becoming the first King of Poland. This was followed by a collapse of the monarchy and restoration under Casimir I. Casimir's son Boles≈Çaw II the Bold became fatally involved in a conflict with the ecclesiastical authority, and was expelled from the country. After Boles≈Çaw III divided the country among his sons, internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchy structure in the 12th and 13th centuries. One of the regional Piast dukes invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans, which caused centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and then with the German Prussian state. The Kingdom was restored under W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, strengthened and expanded by his son Casimir III the Great. The western provinces of Silesia and Pomerania were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for, after the reigns of two members of the Angevin dynasty, the new powerful Kingdom of Poland that was to follow. Late Middle Ages Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila (W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço), the Jagiellon dynasty (1385‚Äì1569) formed the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union. The partnership brought vast Lithuania- controlled Rus' areas into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries. In the Baltic Sea region Poland's struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and included the milestone Peace of Thorn under King Casimir IV Jagiellon; the treaty created the future Duchy of Prussia. In the south Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars, and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Poland was developing as a feudal state, with predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly dominant landed nobility component. The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Sejm (parliament) in 1505, transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as \\"Golden Liberty\\", when the state was ruled by the \\"free and equal\\" Polish nobility. Protestant Reformation movements made deep inroads into the Polish Christianity, which resulted in unique at that time in Europe policies of religious tolerance. The European Renaissance currents evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus) an immense cultural flowering. Poland's and Lithuania's territorial expansion included the far north region of Livonia.J√≥zef Andrzej Gierowski ‚Äì Historia Polski 1505‚Äì1764 (History of Poland 1505‚Äì1764), Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Polish Scientific Publishers PWN), Warszawa 1986, See also *Culture of medieval Poland *Obotrites *Principality of Nitra Notes a.\\"Though their names are now dispersed amid various clans and places, yet they are chiefly called Sclaveni and Antes\\"; transl. by Charles Christopher Mierow, Princeton University Press 1908, from the University of Calgary web site b.This is the so-called allochthonic theory; according to the autochthonic theory the opposite is true References ","title":"History of Poland in the Middle Ages"},{"id":"2164625","text":"Sharry Konopski (December 2, 1967August 25, 2017) was an American model and actress.

He was one of the founders of Sinn F√©in and was the party's president from 1908 to 1911.Sweetman archive, National Library of Ireland, Accession No. 6751 (2010) Early life He was the eldest son of John Sweetman(1805-1859) (a Dublin brewer) and Honoria,(1804-1879) daughter of Malachy O'Connor (a Dublin merchant). He was born in County Dublin and educated at Downside School in Somerset. He lived at Drumbaragh, Kells, County Meath. He married Agnes Hanly in Navan, County Meath on 11 September 1895. They had six children, four sons and two daughters.  Political career  In 1879 he was prominent enough in Irish nationalist circles to be a committee member and propose the election of Charles Stewart Parnell as president of the Irish Land League. In 1880 he visited Minnesota and became involved with Bishop Ireland's scheme to settle poor Irish people in the State, recently vacated by the Eastern Dakota. On 27 December 1881 The Times published an article from 'a correspondent' (who may have been Sweetman himself) about 'An Irish Colony. Currie, Murray County, Minnesota'. The article explained that John Sweetman was the Managing Director of the Irish-American Colonization Company, \\"the principal organizer and practical director of the emigration...in order to make the most profitable selection of lands Mr Sweetman travelled through and carefully examined the States of Dakota and Minnesota, and also Manitoba, and finally purchased some 20,000 acres (80 km¬≤) of prairie land situated in Murray County ...\\". Unfortunately the colonisation project was not a complete success, but it did help a number of people to obtain a better life in America. The Sweetman brewery in Dublin was purchased by Casey's Drogheda Brewery Ltd in 1890. He was a major investor in the National Press newspaper. The Times of 3 June 1892 mentioned that \\"Mr John Sweetman of County Meath, who had contributed ¬£1,000 as a donation to the fund for starting the National Press, had been unanimously selected for the Eastern Division\\". This was at a convention to select Nationalist candidates for the two Parliamentary constituencies in County Wicklow. He was elected at the 1892 general election as MP for East Wicklow as a member of the Anti-Parnellite faction of the Irish Parliamentary Party. He became a Parnellite in 1895 and resigned the seat on 8 April 1895. At the resulting by-election 26 April 1895, he stood as a Parnellite candidate but was defeated in a closely fought three- way contest.Walker, op. cit, page 151 At the general election in July 1895 he stood in North Meath, where he narrowly failed to unseat the sitting anti- Parnellite MP James Gibney.Walker, op. cit, page 155  Radicalisation  By the early twentieth century he had become more radical. In 1905, speaking at the annual conference of the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland in response to a paper suggesting the replanting of the waste lands of Ireland as a remedy to emigration, he displayed considerable hostility to the \\"English\\" government. The Times reported that he said \\"it was not for that society to call upon its greatest enemy, the English government, to plant forests. The English government hated the Irish nation as that of Egypt hated the Jewish nation, and they must fight the Government with all the weapons that God had given them, just as Moses had fought the Egyptians. Unfortunately they had not the power to call down the ten plagues of Egypt upon the English Government, but they could boycott England's manufactures and her Navy and Army\\". He was one of the founders of Sinn F√©in in 1905. He became the party's second president in 1908, succeeding Edward Martyn, and retained the presidency until 1911 when he stepped down, to be succeeded by Arthur Griffith. He was briefly arrested and detained after the 1916 Easter Rising. He turned down a Sinn F√©in nomination for the 1918 general election on the grounds that he was too old; his cousin Roger Sweetman was Teachta D√°la (TD) for North Wexford from 1918 to 1921. Sweetman supported the Pro-Treaty faction in the Civil War period but later denounced the government of W. T. Cosgrave for its abandonment of Griffith's protectionist economic policies, and supported Fianna F√°il after 1927. Throughout his life he wrote many letters to Irish newspapers, and in the late 1920s and early 1930s he was a contributor to The Leader edited by D. P. Moran. Sweetman was fiercely opposed to the Blueshirts (of which his other cousin Gerard Sweetman was an enthusiastic member), comparing Eoin O'Duffy to Hitler. He also opposed plans to build a Catholic Cathedral in Merrion Square, where he himself lived, on the grounds that this would cause great trouble and inconvenience to the residents. He died in Dublin in 1936 aged 92. References  Sources  * Who's Who of British Members of Parliament: Vol. II 1886-1918, edited by M. Stenton and S.

An earlier incarnation of the group was known as Juvenile Style . Rappers Francisco \\"AK\\" G√≥mez and Sergio \\"Wikid\\" G√≥mez, who make up Akwid, are brothers, originally from Jiquilpan, Michoac√°n, now live in Los Angeles, California. Before becoming Akwid both \\"AK\\" and \\"Wikid\\" were part of a former rap group named the \\"Head Knockerz\\" with other group members Sabu and John John Early life Sergio and Francisco G√≥mez were born in Jiquilpan, Michoac√°n, Mexico. Relocated to the United States of America at the ages of five and three years. They are not twins, Sergio is older. They grew up a mile West from Down Town LA in an area now known as Westlake South. Sergio Gomez and his siblings attended 10th St Elementary and Berendo Junior High. Educated later on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, they discovered a musical talent and a great concern among the worlds of Hip Hop. They were recognized and aggressively pressed the fusion of music and culture. Akwid gave life and the identity of people who today represents youth between communities worldwide. Appointed pioneers of the genre, humbly G√≥mez brothers are in the world of creation and expression through music. Conquering one to see with a unique style to others. Discography Their Second album, Proyecto Akwid, won two Billboard Prizes and a Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. Their 2004 album Hoy, Ayer, and Forever remixes several songs from the album 2002 A.D. using their more recent style, incorporating regional Mexican music. Their 2004 album KOMP 104.9 Radio Compa is in the form of a broadcast on a fictitious radio station that plays only Akwid, and their 2005 album Los Aguacates De Jiquilpan is in the form of a fairy tale explaining their arrival from Mexico to the U.S.. They are currently signed to Universal's Machete Music. Their song, \\"¬°Chivas Explosivas!\\" is the official anthem for Club Deportivo Chivas USA of Major League Soccer.adidas MLS Soccer< Akwid's music, such as their song \\"No Hay Manera,\\" has had heavy cultural and musical impact, and was part of a Mexicanization of Los Angeles into \\"Nuevo L.A.\\" \\"No Hay Manera\\" first became popular in 2003, and was played on both U.S. urban and Mexican regional radios, which, at the time, was a breakthrough for Mexican-American hip-hop. Furthermore, \\"No Hay Manera\\" began the slow addition of hip-hop into Mexican music. The song features rapping, in Spanish, over a distinctly Mexican style of band music. Ethnomusicologist Josh Kun separates \\"No Hay Manera\\" into three different musical layers: the hip-hop style lyrics, the use of a banda orquesta sample, and the use of \\"Te Lo Pido Por Favor.\\" Each of these layers has its own influences, and all together, create a hybrid of Mexican and American styles. The lyrics of the song draw heavily from an African-American hip-hop style, and also from the popular Chicano style of rapping. The banda orquesta, on the other hand, is a Mexican band that mixes the structure and sound of American big bands with Mexican orchestras, and quickly became the symbolic music of Mexicans living in the U.S. in the 1990s. Lastly, \\"Te Lo Pido Por Favor,\\" sung by Juan Gabriel, was regarded as a national symbol of Mexican music. Its use indicated a meshing of Mexican and American identity. These layers are important, because Los Angeles was the center of Mexican and African American or American music. Akwid's music is a representation of the strong Mexican identity within Mexican-Americans living in the United States. Unlike many other immigrants, Mexicans retain a deep connection with Mexico, and frequently visit the country or send money back home. Kun calls this a cross-border continuum, in that Mexican immigration to the United States is circular rather than one-way. Mexican immigrants themselves were also very reluctant to give up their culture and assimilate into the United States. In \\"No Hay Manera,\\" Akwid raps about refusing to assimilate, and reconnecting with their Mexican roots. Overall, Akwid's music is representative of the cultural hybridity occurring in Los Angeles in the late 20th century. Kun, Josh. \\"What Is an MC If He Can't Rap to Banda?

Utility stations, as the name suggests, do broadcast signals that have an immediate practical use, by means of analog or usually digital modes; most often utility transmissions are of a \\"point-to-point\\" nature, intended for a specific receiving station. Utility stations are most prevalent on shortwave frequencies, though they are not restricted to the shortwave frequencies.  Examples of utility station and modes  One common use of utility stations is disseminating weather information. Weather information is often broadcast using RTTY and sending synoptic codes, or weather charts are sent using radiofax, which are used by mariners and others. Airports make voice weather broadcasts on HF, known as VOLMET. Some examples include New York Radio, which broadcasts weather information for locations in the eastern United States, or Shanwick Radio, which does the same for Europe. HF frequencies are still often used for trans-oceanic air traffic control. News agencies previously used RTTY for news stories, and, less commonly, radiofax for the images, although this is no longer done. Satellite communications and the Internet have replaced HF for this application. Many maritime radio services are often known as utility stations, including as ship-to-shore and vice versa telephony and error- correcting radioteletype such as SITOR. Military use of shortwave is also common, but nearly all transmissions are encrypted, with voice encrypted using modes such as ANDVT. Data transmission may make use of encrypted RTTY, use Link-11 for radar tracking data, or use of Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) modes to set up communication links automatically. Some utility stations are on other frequency bands, including NOAA Weather Radio, traveler information stations, and the like; other utility-type signals are piggybacked on FM broadcast subcarriers.

The specific epithet ganitrus is derived from ganitri, the name for this species in Sundanese and Malay. Description Elaeocarpus ganitrus grows in the area from the Gangetic plain in the foothills of the Himalayas to South-East Asia, Indonesia, New Guinea, Guam, and Hawaii. Rudraksha seeds are covered by an outer husk of blue colour when fully ripe, and for this reason are also known as blueberry beads. The blue colour is not derived from pigment but is structural. It is an evergreen tree that grows quickly. The rudraksha tree starts bearing fruit in three to four years. As the tree matures, the roots buttress rising up narrowly near the trunk and radiating out along the surface of the ground.

Both the play and film were written and directed by Luis Valdez. The film stars Daniel Valdez, Edward James Olmos -- both reprising their roles from the stage production -- and Tyne Daly. Many members of the cast of the Broadway production also appeared in the film. Like the play, the film features music from Daniel Valdez and Lalo Guerrero, the \\"father of Chicano music.\\" In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot In Zoot Suit, Luis Valdez weaves a story involving the real-life events of the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial -- when a group of young Mexican-Americans were charged with murder -- resulting in the racially fueled Zoot Suit Riots throughout Los Angeles. In the play, Henry Reyna (inspired by real-life defendant Hank Leyvas) is a pachuco gangster and his gang, who were unfairly prosecuted, are thrown in jail for a murder they did not commit. The play is set in the barrios of Los Angeles in the early 1940s against the backdrop of the Zoot Suit Riots and World War II. As in the play, Edward James Olmos portrays El Pachuco, an idealized Zoot Suiter, who functions as narrator throughout the story and serves as Henry's conscience.

That is, it asks for analogues of the roots of unity, as complex numbers that are particular values of the exponential function; the requirement is that such numbers should generate a whole family of further number fields that are analogues of the cyclotomic fields and their subfields. The classical theory of complex multiplication, now often known as the Kronecker Jugendtraum, does this for the case of any imaginary quadratic field, by using modular functions and elliptic functions chosen with a particular period lattice related to the field in question. Goro Shimura extended this to CM fields. The general case is still open . Leopold Kronecker described the complex multiplication issue as his ' or ‚Äúdearest dream of his youth‚Äù.  Description of the problem  The fundamental problem of algebraic number theory is to describe the fields of algebraic numbers. The work of Galois made it clear that field extensions are controlled by certain groups, the Galois groups. The simplest situation, which is already at the boundary of what is well-understood, is when the group in question is abelian. All quadratic extensions, obtained by adjoining the roots of a quadratic polynomial, are abelian, and their study was commenced by Gauss. Another type of abelian extension of the field Q of rational numbers is given by adjoining the nth roots of unity, resulting in the cyclotomic fields. Already Gauss had shown that, in fact, every quadratic field is contained in a larger cyclotomic field. The Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem shows that any finite abelian extension of Q is contained in a cyclotomic field. Kronecker's (and Hilbert's) question addresses the situation of a more general algebraic number field K: what are the algebraic numbers necessary to construct all abelian extensions of K? The complete answer to this question has been completely worked out only when K is an imaginary quadratic field or its generalization, a CM-field. Hilbert's original statement of his 12th problem is rather misleading: he seems to imply that the abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields are generated by special values of elliptic modular functions, which is not correct. (It is hard to tell exactly what Hilbert was saying, one problem being that he may have been using the term \\"elliptic function\\" to mean both the elliptic function ‚Ñò and the elliptic modular function j.) First it is also necessary to use roots of unity, though Hilbert may have implicitly meant to include these. More seriously, while values of elliptic modular functions generate the Hilbert class field, for more general abelian extensions one also needs to use values of elliptic functions. For example, the abelian extension \\\\mathbf{Q}(i,\\\\sqrt[4]{1+2i})/\\\\mathbf{Q}(i) is not generated by singular moduli and roots of unity. One particularly appealing way to state the Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem is by saying that the maximal abelian extension of Q can be obtained by adjoining the special values exp(2œÄi/n) of the exponential function. Similarly, the theory of complex multiplication shows that the maximal abelian extension of Q(œÑ), where œÑ is an imaginary quadratic irrationality, can be obtained by adjoining the special values of ‚Ñò(œÑ,z) and j(œÑ) of modular functions j and elliptic functions ‚Ñò, and roots of unity, where œÑ is in the imaginary quadratic field and z represents a torsion point on the corresponding elliptic curve. One interpretation of Hilbert's twelfth problem asks to provide a suitable analogue of exponential, elliptic, or modular functions, whose special values would generate the maximal abelian extension Kab of a general number field K. In this form, it remains unsolved. A description of the field Kab was obtained in the class field theory, developed by Hilbert himself, Emil Artin, and others in the first half of the 20th century.In particular, Teiji Takagi proved the existence of the absolute abelian extension as the well-known Takagi existence theorem. However the construction of Kab in class field theory involves first constructing larger non-abelian extensions using Kummer theory, and then cutting down to the abelian extensions, so does not really solve Hilbert's problem which asks for a more direct construction of the abelian extensions.  Modern development  Developments since around 1960 have certainly contributed. Before that in his dissertation used Hilbert modular forms to study abelian extensions of real quadratic fields. Complex multiplication of abelian varieties was an area opened up by the work of Shimura and Taniyama. This gives rise to abelian extensions of CM-fields in general. The question of which extensions can be found is that of the Tate modules of such varieties, as Galois representations. Since this is the most accessible case of l-adic cohomology, these representations have been studied in depth. Robert Langlands argued in 1973 that the modern version of the ' should deal with Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta functions of Shimura varieties. While he envisaged a grandiose program that would take the subject much further, more than thirty years later serious doubts remain concerning its import for the question that Hilbert asked. A separate development was Stark's conjecture (Harold Stark), which in contrast dealt directly with the question of finding interesting, particular units in number fields. This has seen a large conjectural development for L-functions, and is also capable of producing concrete, numerical results.

On December 4, 1972, Stayner, age 7, was abducted in Merced, California by child molester Kenneth Parnell. He was held by his abductor 200 miles away in Mendocino County, California until he was 14, when he managed to escape with another of Parnell's victims, Timothy White. Stayner died in 1989 in a motorcycle accident while riding home from work. Birth and family Stayner was the third of five children born to Delbert and Kay Stayner in Merced, California. He had three sisters and an older brother, Cary. In 2002, Cary was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1999 murders of four women. Kidnapping On the afternoon of December 4, 1972, Stayner was approached on his way home from school by a man named Ervin Edward Murphy, who had become acquainted with convicted child rapist Kenneth Parnell as they both worked at a resort in Yosemite National Park. Murphy, described by those who knew him as a trusting, na√Øve, and simple-minded man, had been enlisted by Parnell (who had passed himself off to Murphy as an aspiring minister)Echols 1999, pp. 38-39Echols 1999, p. 85 into helping him abduct a young boy so that Parnell could \\"raise him in a religious-type deal,\\" as Murphy later stated. Acting on instructions from Parnell, Murphy passed out gospel tracts to boys walking home from school that dayEchols 1991, p. 42 and, after spotting Stayner, claimed to be a church representative seeking donations. Stayner later claimed that Murphy asked him if his mother would be willing to donate any items to the church. When the boy replied that she would, Murphy then asked Stayner where he lived and if he would be willing to take Murphy to his home. After Stayner agreed, a white Buick driven by Parnell pulled up, and Stayner willingly climbed into the car with Murphy. Parnell then drove a confused Stayner to his cabin in nearby Catheys Valley instead. Unbeknownst to Stayner, Parnell's cabin was located only several hundred feet from his maternal grandfather's residence.Echols 1991, p. 95 Parnell molested Stayner the first night at the cabin.Echols 1999, p. 48 Parnell began raping Stayner thirteen days later, on December 17, 1972.Echols 1991, p. 94 After telling Parnell that he wanted to go home many times during that first week, Parnell told Stayner that he had been granted legal custody of the boy because his parents could not afford so many children and that they did not want him anymore.Echols 1999, pp. 91-92 Parnell began calling the boy Dennis Gregory Parnell,Echols 1999, p. 91 retaining Stayner's real middle name and his real birth date when enrolling him in various schools over the next several years. Parnell passed himself off as Stayner's father, and the two moved frequently around California, living in locations including Santa Rosa and Comptche. Parnell allowed Stayner to begin drinking at a young age and to come and go virtually as he pleased. Parnell had also bounced from one menial job to another, some of his work requiring travel and leaving Stayner unguarded, causing an adult Stayner to remark he could have easily used these absences as opportunities to flee, but was unaware how to summon help. One of the few positive aspects of Stayner's life with Parnell was the dog he had received as a gift from him, a Manchester Terrier that he named Queenie. This dog had been given to Parnell by his mother, who was not aware of Stayner's existence during the period when he was living with Parnell.Echols 1999, pp. 90-91 For a period of eighteen months, a woman named Barbara Mathias lived with Parnell and Stayner. According to Stayner, Mathias, along with Parnell, raped him on nine separate occasions at the age of nine.Echols 1999, pp. 117 In 1975, on Parnell's instruction, Mathias tried to lure another young boy, who was in the Santa Rosa Boys' Club with Stayner, into Parnell's car. The attempt was unsuccessful.Echols 1999, pp. 123 Mathias later claimed to have been completely unaware that \\"Dennis\\" had, in fact, been kidnapped. =Escape= As Stayner entered puberty, Parnell began to look for a younger child to kidnap. Parnell had used Stayner to attempt to kidnap children on prior occasions. However, all the kidnapping attempts were unsuccessful. This caused Parnell to believe Stayner lacked the means to be an accomplice; Stayner later revealed he intentionally sabotaged these failed kidnappings. On February 14, 1980, Parnell and a teenage friend of Stayner's named Randall Sean Poorman kidnapped five-year-old Timothy White in Ukiah. Motivated in part by the young boy's distress, Stayner decided to return the boy to his parents. On March 1, 1980, while Parnell was away at his night security job, Stayner left with White and hitchhiked into Ukiah. Unable to locate White's home address, he decided to have White walk into the police station to ask for help, without him. Police officers spotted and detained both of them. Stayner immediately identified White and then revealed his own true identity and story. By daybreak on March 2, 1980, Parnell had been arrested on suspicion of abducting both boys. When the police checked into his background they found a previous sodomy conviction from 1951. Both children were reunited with their families that day. In 1981, Parnell was tried and convicted of kidnapping White and Stayner in two separate trials. He was sentenced to seven years but was paroled after serving five. Parnell was not charged with the numerous sexual assaults on Stayner and other boys because most of them occurred outside the jurisdiction of the Merced County prosecutor or were by then outside the statute of limitations. The Mendocino County prosecutors, acting almost entirely alone, decided not to prosecute Parnell for the sexual assaults that occurred in their jurisdiction. Murphy and Poorman, who had helped abduct White, were convicted of lesser charges. Both claimed they knew nothing of the sexual assaults on Stayner. Mathias was never arrested.Echols 1999 pp.250-291 Stayner remembered the kindness \\"Uncle\\" Murphy had shown him in his first week of captivity while they were both under the influence of Parnell's manipulation, and he believed that Murphy was as much Parnell's victim as he and Timmy were.Echols 1999 p.291 Stayner's kidnapping and its aftermath prompted California lawmakers to change state laws \\"to allow consecutive prison terms in similar abduction cases.\\"Ramirez, Jessica. \\"The Abductions That Changed America\\", Newsweek, January 29, 2007, pp. 54‚Äì55. Later life and death After returning to his family, Stayner had trouble adjusting to a more structured household as he had been allowed to smoke, drink and do as he pleased when he lived with Parnell. In an interview with Newsweek shortly after his escape, Stayner said, \\"I returned almost a grown man and yet my parents saw me at first as their 7-year-old. After they stopped trying to teach me the fundamentals all over again, it got better. But why doesn't my dad hug me anymore? [...] Everything has changed. Sometimes I blame myself. I don't know sometimes if I should have come home. Would I have been better off if I didn't?\\" Stayner underwent brief counseling but never sought additional treatment. He also refused to disclose all the details of sexual abuse he endured from Parnell. In a 2007 interview, Stayner's sister said that her brother did not seek counseling because their father said Stayner \\"didn't need any\\". She added, \\"He [Steven] got on with his life but he was pretty messed up.\\" He was bullied by other children at school for being molested and eventually dropped out. Stayner began to drink frequently, and was eventually kicked out of the family home. His relationship with his father remained strained. In 1985, Stayner married 17-year-old Jody Edmondson, with whom he had two children. He also worked with child abduction groups, spoke to children about personal safety, and gave interviews about his kidnapping. He joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just before his death. At the time of his death, Stayner was living in Merced and working at a pizza shop. On September 16, 1989, Stayner sustained fatal head injuries while on his way home from work when his motorcycle collided with a car. Five hundred people attended his funeral, at which 14-year-old Timmy White was a pallbearer. Media adaptations In early 1989, a television miniseries based on his experience, I Know My First Name is Steven (also known as The Missing Years), was produced. Steven, taking a leave of absence from his job, acted as an advisor for Lorimar-Telepictures and had a non-speaking part, playing one of the two policemen who escort 14-year-old Steven (played by Corin Nemec) through the crowds to his waiting family, on his return to his Merced home. Although pleased with the dramatization, Stayner did complain that it depicted him as a somewhat \\"obnoxious, rude\\" person, especially toward his parents, something he refuted while publicizing the miniseries in the spring of 1989. The two-part miniseries was first broadcast by NBC on May 21‚Äì22, 1989.A.P syndicated report printed in the New York Times September 18, 1989 Screening rights were sold to a number of international television companies including the BBC, which screened the miniseries in mid-July of the following year; later still, it was released as a feature-length movie. The production was based on a manuscript by Mike Echols, who had researched the story and interviewed Stayner and Parnell, among others. After the premiere of I Know My First Name is Steven, which received four Emmy Award nominations, including one for Nemec. Echols published his book, I Know My First Name is Steven, in 1991. In the epilogue to his book, Echols describes how he infiltrated NAMBLA. In 1999, against the wishes of the Stayner family, Echols wrote an additional chapter, about Steven's older brother Cary at the request of his publisher, which then re-published the book.Article by Tim Bragg (staff writer) printed in the Merced Sun-Star newspaper, Aug. 1999. The title of the film and book are taken from the first paragraph of Steven's written police statement, given during the early hours of March 2, 1980 in Ukiah. It reads (note the incorrect spelling of his family name);Echols 1999 p. 212 > \\"My name is Steven Stainer [sic]. I am fourteen years of age. I don't know > my true birthdate, but I use April 18, 1965. I know my first name is Steven, > I'm pretty sure my last is Stainer [sic], and if I have a middle name, I > don't know it.\\" Steven's story was also included in the book Against Their Will by Nigel Cawthorne, a compilation of stories of kidnappings. Aftermath Ten years after Stayner's death, the city of Merced asked its residents to propose names for city parks honoring Merced's notable citizens. Stayner's parents proposed that one be named \\"Stayner Park\\". This idea was eventually rejected and the honor was instead given to another Merced resident, because Stayner's brother Cary confessed to, and was charged with, killing four women in Yosemite in 1999; Merced city officials feared that the name \\"Stayner Park\\" would be associated with Cary rather than Steven.MacGowan, Douglas. \\"The Lost Boy\\", CourtTV's Crime Library In 2004, Parnell, then 72 years old, was convicted of trying the previous year to persuade his nurse to procure for him a young boy for five hundred dollars. The nurse, aware of Parnell's past, reported this to local police. Timmy White, then a grown man, was subpoenaed to testify in Parnell's criminal trial. Although Stayner was dead, his testimony at Parnell's earlier trial was read to jurors as evidence in Parnell's 2004 trial. Parnell died of natural causes on January 21, 2008, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, California, while serving a sentence of 25 years to life. White later became a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Deputy. He died on April 1, 2010, at age 35 from pulmonary embolism. White was survived by his wife, Dena, and two young children, as well as by his mother, father, stepfather and sister. Nearly five months later, on August 28, 2010, a statue of Stayner and White was dedicated in Applegate Park in Merced. Residents of Ukiah, White's hometown, carved a statue showing a teenage Stayner with young White in hand while escaping their captivity. Fundraisers for the statue have stated that it is meant to honor Steven Stayner and give families of missing and kidnapped children hope that they are still alive. Steven's father, Delbert Stayner, died on April 9, 2013 at his home in Winton, California. He was 79 years old.

Before that, Native Americans speaking Algonquin languages had inhabited Ohio and the central midwestern United States for hundreds of years until displaced by the Iroquois in the latter part of the 17th century. Other cultures not generally identified as \\"Indians\\", including the Hopewell \\"mound builders\\", preceded them. Human history in Ohio began a few millennia after formation of the Bering land bridge about 14,500BCE - see Prehistory of Ohio. By the mid-18th century, a few American and French fur traders engaged historic Native American tribes in present-day Ohio in the fur trade. The Native Americans had their own extensive trading networks across the continent before the Europeans arrived. American settlement in the Ohio Country came after the American Revolutionary War and the formation of the United States, with its takeover of former British Canadian territory. Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory which presaged Ohio and the five states of the Territory entering the Union as free states. Ohio's population increased rapidly after United States victory in the Northwest Indian Wars brought peace to the Ohio frontier. In 1803, Ohio was admitted to the union as the 17th state. Settlement was chiefly by migrants from New England, New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled along the southern part of the territory, arriving by travel along the Ohio River from the Upper South. Yankees, especially in the \\"Western reserve\\" (near Cleveland), supported modernization, public education, and anti-slavery policies. The state supported the Union in the American Civil War, although antiwar Copperhead sentiment was strong in southern settlements. After the Civil War, Ohio developed as a major industrial state. Ships traveled the Great Lakes to deliver iron ore and other products from western areas. This was also a route for exports, as were the railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that employed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was closed off to passenger traffic. A new wave of migrants came from the South, with rural whites from Appalachia, and African Americans in the Great Migration from the Deep South, to escape Jim Crow and violence. The cultures of Ohio's major cities became much more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods, and music of the new arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power in the 20th century. In the later 20th century, economic restructuring in steel, railroads, and other heavy manufacturing cost the state many jobs as heavy industry declined. The economy in the 21st century has gradually shifted to depend on service industries such as medicine and education. Prehistoric period The Great Serpent Mound earthwork in Adams County Artists conception of the Fort Ancient period SunWatch Indian Village in Dayton A fossil which dated between 11,727 and 11,424 B.C. indicated that Paleo-Indians hunted large animals, including Jefferson's ground sloth, using stone tools. Later ancestors of Native Americans were known as the Archaic peoples. Sophisticated successive cultures such as the Adena, Hopewell and Fort Ancient, built monumental earthworks such as massive monuments, some of which have survived to the present. The Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the Maple Creek Culture of southwestern Ohio, the Glacial Kame Culture of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, located in present-day Licking County, provided flint, an extremely important raw material and trade good. Objects made from Flint Ridge flint have been found as far east as the Atlantic coast, as far west as Kansas City, and as far south as Louisiana, demonstrating the wide network of prehistoric trading cultures. About 800 BC, Late Archaic cultures were supplanted by the Adena culture. The Adenas were mound builders. Many of their thousands of mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the Adena culture was the Hopewell culture (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as astronomical observatories and places of ritual celebration. The Fort Ancient culture also built mounds, including some effigy mounds. Researchers first considered the Serpent Mound in Adams County, Ohio to be an Adena mound. It is the largest effigy mound in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people. In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 miles, enclosing about 100 acres. We now know from a great variety of items found in the mound tombs - large ceremonial blades chipped from obsidian rock formations in Yellowstone National Park; embossed breast-plates, ornaments and weapons fashioned from copper nuggets from the Great Lakes region; decorative objects cut from sheets of mica from the southern Appalachians; conch shells from the Atlantic seaboard; and ornaments made from shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf of Mexico - that the Mound Builders participated in a vast trading network that linked together hundreds of Native Americans across the continent.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black. Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, p. 6 It has also been found that Hopewell era settlements were cities by population density alone, with thousands of residents at their peak. After the Hopewell collapsed, though, there was little to nothing left but small, unaffiliated farming villages until after 900 AD, when new cultures slowly began to emerge. Sometime, presumably between the years 1100 and 1300 AD, Iroquoian people's began to aggressively expand their influence, conquering into Ohio from the northeast and displacing many of the preexisting cultures in the Great Lakes Region. When modern Europeans began to arrive in North America, they traded with numerous Native American (also known as American Indian) tribes for furs in exchange for goods. In the year 1600 AD, Ohio was divided between several native tribes who were part of three cultures- Iroquoians, Algonquians and Siouans. The tribes we know by name were the Erie in the Northeast, the Mascouten north of the Maumee River, the Miami in the west and the Mosopelea in the southeast. Fort Ancients held the south and another group called The Monongahela Culture extended slightly into eastern Ohio, just south of the Erie, from across the Ohio River. But, a combination of war and disease quickly decimated the local people's before much interaction could take place and all tribes except the Miami were either permanently driven away, or destroyed. When the Iroquois Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory in the New York region, they launched a war known as the Beaver Wars, destroying or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the region. During the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the Erie along the shore of Lake Erie. Overall, they managed to expand their territory through the North shore of Lakes Ontario and Erie, throughout Ohio, Indiana and southern Michigan and south from their original Homeland in New York, all the way to the James River in Virginia when the war seems to have officially ended in 1701, but the French began aiding other native people's who had fled west and took nearly all of that land for themselves, naming it the Illinois Colony. During the war, the Sauk and Fox tribe, who were Algonquian people's displaced from the Ottawa River valley in Canada, migrated into Ohio and Michigan before the Iroquois quickly drove them all the way to Minnesota. After the war, Ohio mainly belonged to only Iroquoians and Algonquians- the Mingo/ Seneca, the Shawnee, the Lenape/ Delaware, the Miami, the Ottawa/ Mississauga/ Chippewa (not to be confused with the Ottawa who were still a part of the Anishinaabeg of Lake Superior, or the Algonquians of the Ottawa River), the Wyandot and the Guyandotte/ Little Mingo. The Shawnee migrated from the southeast and were sometimes known as the Savannah, the Lenape had relocated from New Jersey and the Ottawa and Wyandot seem to have been formed from Algonquian, Huron and Anishinaabeg captured by the Iroquois during the war, who broke free of their control. The Guyandotte may have been related to a small Iroquoian tribe called the Petun, which had also been destroyed in the war. Native people's in Ohio were known to grow different varieties of corn, Lima beans and squash. The Hopewells had also domesticated Goosefoot, a local variant of quinoa, as well as Sunflower, but Fort Ancients traded goosefoot for corn when it arrived in the 14th century. It would appear that squash is the oldest domesticated plant in the Ohio River Valley. Wild native plants that Native Americans were known to, or may have likely, utilized for food are as follows: Acorn*, Beech Nut*, Bergamot, Black Cherry, Black Raspberry, Black Walnut, Blueberry, Bog Rosemary*, Butternut, Cattail, Chestnut*, Chokecherry, Crabapple, Cranberry, Dewberry, Elderberry*, Fil√© (Sassafras), Firethorn Berry, Ginger, Haw, Hazelnut, Hickory Nut, Highbush cranberry, Hogpeanut, Indian Cucumber, Indian Potato, Jerusalem artichoke, Juniper berry*, Kentucky coffeetree*, Lady Fern*, Leatherleaf*, Lilypad Root, Maple (syrup and sugar), Milkweed*, Papaw, Partridgeberry, Persimmon, Red Currant, Red Mulberry, Rowan Berry, Serviceberry, Solomon's Seal*, Spicebush Laurel*, Spruce (pine nuts, nettles as spice, cuttings for spruce tea/ beer, sap as chewing gum ingredient and spruce tips for jelly), Sumac, Tuckahoe, Wild Carrot, Wild Grape (juice only), Wild Mint (various), Wild Onion, Wild Peas*, Wild Plum, Wild rice, Wild Rose ( Illinois and Swamp roses), Wild Strawberry, Wild Sweet Potato and Wintergreen (berries and leaves). * Asterisks follow if potential risk of poison, or easy confusion for poisonous lookalike. =Beaver Wars= In 1608, French explorer and founder of Quebec City Samuel Champlain sided with the Ottawa River Algonquian, Huron and surviving Saint Lawrence Iroquoian peoples living along the St. Lawrence River against the Iroquois Confederacy (\\"Five Nations\\") living in what is now upper and western New York state in what was known as the Ticonderoga War. The result was a lasting enmity by the Iroquois Confederacy towards the French, which caused them to side with the Dutch fur traders coming up the Hudson River in about 1626. But, as the Dutch feared giving the Iroquois firearms, they later found new allies- presumably the English, 30 years before the English had formally claimed Iroquois lands. Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage, depicting a battle between Iroquois and Algonquian tribes near Lake Champlain With these more sophisticated weapons, the Five Nations nearly exterminated the Huron and all of the other Native Americans living immediately to their west in the Ohio country during the Beaver Wars, beginning in 1632. The Five Nations's use of modern weapons caused the wars to become deadlier. Historians consider the Beaver Wars to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of North America. About 1664, the Five Nations officially became trading partners with the British, who conquered the New Netherlands (renamed New York) from the Dutch. The Five Nations enlarged their territory by right of conquest. The number of tribes paying tribute to them realigned the tribal map of eastern North America. Several large confederacies were destroyed or relocated, including the Huron, Neutral, Erie, Susquehannock, Miami, Weskerini Algonquian, Kichesipirini Algonquian, Mascouten, Fox, Sauk, Petun, Manahoac and Saponi-Tutelo. The Five Nations pushed several eastern tribes to and even across the Mississippi River, as well as south, into the Carolinas. After the Five Nations' warriors were defeated between 1670 and 1701, the French and their allies took control, but the French-Indian Wars between England, France and all their remaining native allies, began just a few years later. Several small wars between the two countries in Europe spilled over into the Americas and were used as an excuse to try to seize more territory. By the late 1750s, all of the former Illinois Colony had been conquered and renamed the Ohio Country. The Jesuit Relations... 1610-1791, Creighton University, accessed January 20, 2009 http://www.militaryheritage.com/7yrswar.htm =Dunmore's War= After the French-Indian Wars, one final war occurred immediately before the Revolutionary War. Dunmore's War was fought between the English and Shawnee roughly between Yellow Creek in Columbiana County and the West Virginia- Kentucky border. The English locals claimed that the Shawnee had been rustling cattle, but it was later concluded that they had lied to facilitate a war. Of the two Shawnee chiefs who fought in the war, Chief Logan's family were all hunted down and assassinated and Chief Cornstalk was said to have cursed the land where his village had once stood.Downes, Randolph C. Council Fires on the Upper Ohio: A Narrative of Indian Affairs in the Upper Ohio Valley until 1795. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1940. (1989 reprint). Among the Mingo Seneca, the brother of Chief Cornplanter, a high ranking False Face (Iroquois Shaman) reworked the old Iroquois religion into the Longhouse Church when in Ohio. This version of Iroquois religion took on various Christian elements (belief in hell, downgrading of all deities aside the Creator to something akin to angels/ demons and regular Church meetings) while keeping alive most of the old holidays and ceremonies and is still practiced by most members of the Iroquois Confederacy today.

European colonization =New France= A map of the original Ohio Country In the 17th century, the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known as Ohio Country.The Ohio Country, p. 1. In 1663, it became part of New France, a royal province of French Empire, and northeastern Ohio was further explored by Robert La Salle in 1669. During the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day Canada and what they called the Illinois Country along the Mississippi River. Fort Miami on the site of present-day St. Joseph, Michigan was constructed in 1680 by New France Governor-General Louis de Buade de Frontenac. They built Fort Sandosk√© by 1750 (and perhaps a fortified trading post at Junundat in 1754). By the 1730s, population pressure from expanding European colonies on the Atlantic coast compelled several groups of Native Americans to relocate to the Ohio Country. From the east, the Delaware and Shawnee arrived, and Wyandot and Ottawa from the north. The Miami lived in what is now western Ohio. The Mingo formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes. Christopher Gist was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as George Croghan started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the Miami Indian town of Pickawillany (modern Piqua, Ohio). The French began military occupation of the Ohio Valley in 1753. French and Indian War By the mid-18th century, British traders were rivaling French traders in the area.The great frontier war: Britain, France, and the imperial struggle for North America, 1607‚Äì1755, p. 177 They had occupied a trading post called Loramie's Fort, which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. In the early 1750s George Washington was sent to the Ohio Country by the Ohio Company to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark the French and Indian War. It was in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the Battle of Fort Necessity to Louis Coulon de Villiers in 1754, and the subsequent Battle of the Monongahela to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 1755. The Treaty of Paris ceded the country to Great Britain in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring among the tribes. =British Empire= Prior to the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts.The last French Fort in Ohio Country, Fort Sandusky, was destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion. Just beyond Ohio Country was the great Miami capital of Kekionga which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future Northwest Territory. By the Royal Proclamation of 1763, British lands west of Appalachia were forbidden to settlement by colonists. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Indian lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763. Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Colonel Henry Bouquet brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought Lord Dunmore's War to a conclusion. Lord Dunmore constructed Fort Gower on the Hocking River in 1774. In 1774, Britain passed the Quebec Act that formally annexed Ohio and other western lands to the Province of Quebec in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the American Revolution. =American Revolution= As a result of the exploits of George Rogers Clark in 1778, Ohio Country (including the territory of the future state of Ohio) as well as eastern Illinois Country, became Illinois County, Virginia by claim of conquest under the Virginia Colony charter. The county was dissolved in 1782 and ceded to the United States. Monument commemorating the Moravian Massacre in 1782 near the German American settlement of Gnadenhutten During the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans in the Ohio Country were divided over which side to support. For example, the Shawnee leader Blue Jacket and the Delaware leader Buckongahelas sided with the British. Cornstalk (Shawnee) and White Eyes (Delaware) sought to remain friendly with the rebellious colonists. There was major fighting in 1782.Milo Milton Quaife, \\"The Ohio Campaigns of 1782.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1931): 515‚Äì529. in JSTOR American colonial frontiersmen often did not differentiate between friendly and hostile Indians, however. Cornstalk was killed by American militiamen, and White Eyes may have been. One of the most tragic incidents of the war ‚Äî the killing of 96 Christian Delaware by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania on March 8, 1782 at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, known as the Gnadenhutten massacre ‚Äî took place in Ohio.Rob Harper, \\"Looking the other way: the Gnadenhutten massacre and the contextual interpretation of violence.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (2007): 621‚Äì644. in JSTOR In May of that year, George Washington's close friend William Crawford was captured while leading an expedition against Lenape at Upper Sandusky, Ohio. Though Crawford was not at Gnadenhutten, in revenge, he was tortured for hours then burned at the stake. With the American victory in the Revolutionary War, the British ceded Ohio and its territory in the West as far as the Mississippi River to the new nation. Between 1784 and 1789, the states of Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut ceded their earlier land claims in Ohio Country to Congress, but Virginia and Connecticut maintained reserves.Kip Sperry, Genealogical Research in Ohio, Genealogical Publishing, 2003, p.2 These areas were known as the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve.Harlan Hatcher, The Western Reserve: The Story of New Connecticut in Ohio (1949) Territory and statehood =Rufus Putnam, the \\"Father of Ohio\\"= Rufus Putnam served in important capacities in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War.

This portrait by James Sharples, Jr. is in the collection of Independence National Historical Park, and hangs in the Second Bank of the United States building in Philadelphia. In 1776, the Continental Army had encircled the British Army in Boston, but could not dislodge it, and a long stalemate ensued. Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications, which were put in place under cover of darkness, along with cannon. This then drove the British from Boston. George Washington was so impressed that he made Putnam his chief engineer. After the war, Putnam and Manasseh Cutler were instrumental in creating the Northwest Ordinance, which opened up the Northwest Territory for settlement. This land was used to serve as compensation for what was owed to Revolutionary War veterans. It was also at Putnam‚Äôs recommendation that the land would be surveyed and laid out in townships of six miles square. Putnam organized and led the first group of veterans to the territory. They settled at Marietta, Ohio, where they built a large fort called Campus Martius.Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Campus Martius (\\"Field of Mars\\" in Latin) was named after the part of Rome of the same name. This site, including the Rufus Putnam House, is now part of the Campus Martius Museum in Marietta, Ohio. Putnam and Cutler insisted that the Northwest Territory would be free territory - no slavery. They were both from Puritan New England, and the Puritans strongly believed that slavery was morally wrong. The Northwest Territory doubled the size of the United States, and establishing it as free of slavery proved to be of tremendous importance in the following decades. It encompassed what became Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota. Had those states been slave states, and their electoral votes gone to Abraham Lincoln's main competitor, Lincoln would not have been elected president. The Civil War would not have been fought. And, even if eventually there had been a civil war, the North would probably have lost.Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Putnam, in the Puritan tradition, was influential in establishing education in the Northwest Territory. Substantial amounts of land were set aside for schools. Putnam had been one of the primary benefactors in the founding of Leicester Academy in Massachusetts, and similarly, in 1798, he created the plan for the construction of the Muskingum Academy (now Marietta College) in Ohio. In 1780, the directors of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs relating to settlement north of the Ohio River. In 1796, he was commissioned by President George Washington as Surveyor-General of United States Lands. In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest Territory‚Äôs first court. In 1802, he served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio. Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

That there was continuous occupation of such lands is certain, though the location and continuity of any particular settlement, at least a few of which were referred to loosely as \\"towns\\" is very much in doubt. Most prominent among these were a series of squatters settlements with various names circa 1774 to 1795 in the area of what is today Martin's Ferry, directly across river from Fort Henry. European settlement of Ohio may fairly be said to have been in progression before establishment of the Northwest Territory and the first generally recognized town of Marietta. This monument to the pioneers of Ohio is in Muskingum Park, Front St., Marietta, Ohio. In 1787, the United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of that year. Ebenezer Sproat became a shareholder of the Ohio Company of Associates, and was engaged as a surveyor with the company.Smith and Vining, American Geographers, 1784‚Äì1812, 197.Hulbert, Proceedings of the Ohio Company, Volume I, 26. On April 7, 1788, Ebenezer Sproat and a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory, led by Rufus Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers to establish Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory.Hildreth, Pioneer History, 206.Hulbert, Proceedings of the Ohio Company, Volume I, 24.Cutler, Founders of Ohio, 15‚Äì17. Marietta was founded by New Englanders. It was the first of what would become a prolific number of New England settlements in what was then the Northwest Territory.The expansion of New England: the spread of New England settlement and institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620‚Äì1865 by Lois Kimball Mathews page 175 These New Englanders or \\"Yankees\\" as they were called, were descended from the Puritan English colonists who had settled New England in the 1600s and were members of the Congregationalist church. Correspondingly, the first church in Marietta was a Congregationalist church which was constructed 1786. Colonel Sproat, was a notable member of the pioneer settlement of Marietta. He greatly impressed the local Indians, who in admiration dubbed him \\"Hetuck\\", meaning \\"eye of the buck deer\\" \\"Big Buckeye\\".Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 237.Ohio Division of Forestry, Ohio...The Buckeye State, brochure.Goodman and Brunsman, This Day in Ohio History, 54. Historians believe this is how Ohio came to be known as the Buckeye State and its residents as Buckeyes. The Miami Company (also referred to as the \\"Symmes Purchase\\") managed settlement of land in the southwestern section. The Connecticut Land Company administered settlement in the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast Ohio. A heavy flood of migrants came from New York and especially New England, where there had been a growing hunger for land as population increased before the Revolutionary War. Most traveled to Ohio by wagon and stagecoach, following former Indian paths such as the Northern Trace. Many also traveled part of the way by barges on the Mohawk River across New York state. Farmers who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening to the west. American settlement of the Northwest Territory was resisted by Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War. Two years after the Revolution, the US had begun offering people subsidies to move into the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys to establish farms and virtually all Native people's in the threatened territories joined forces and fought back. In Ohio, the Miami, Wyandot, Shawnee, Lenape, Seneca, Ottawa, Wabash, Illinois, Hochunk, Sauk and Fox nations joined under an Miami warrior who had been asked to fight as their War Chief, Little Turtle. They were eventually conquered by General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. They ceded much of present-day Ohio to the United States by the Treaty of Greenville, concluded in 1795. Starting in the early 19th century, after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase, Congress began investing heavily in trying to convince Natives in the East to relocate west of the Mississippi. The Lenape were a test, and were removed in 1809, but when they complained that the natives of that region were being aggressive towards them and there wasn't enough to hunt and forage, the project was scrapped for several more decades.\\"Removal Era\\", accessed September 8, 2010 The U.S. Congress prohibited slavery in the territory. (Once the population grew and the territory achieved statehood, the citizens could have legalized slavery, but chose not to do so.) The states of the Midwest would be known as Free States, in contrast to those states south of the Ohio River. Migrants to the latter came chiefly from Virginia and other slave-holding states, and brought their culture and slaves with them. As Northeastern states abolished slavery in the coming two generations, the free states would be known as Northern States. The Northwest Territory originally included areas previously called Ohio Country and Illinois Country. As Ohio prepared for statehood, Indiana Territory was carved out, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of Michigan's lower peninsula and a sliver of land in southeastern Indiana along Ohio's western border called \\"The Gore\\". =Statehood= Land patent. Patentee Name: Henry Hanford. Logan Co., Ohio, 1834 With Ohio's population reaching 45,000 in December 1801, Congress determined that the population was growing rapidly and Ohio could begin the path to statehood. The assumption was the territory would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became a state. Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1802 that outlined the process for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention. They used numerous provisions from other states and rejected slavery. On February 19, 1803, President Jefferson signed the act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. Congress did not pass a specific resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress' declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, when Louisiana was admitted as the 18th state. =Shawnee War and War of 1812= Starting around 1809, the Shawnee began to feel restless again. Under Chief Tecumseh, the Shawnee War officially began in Ohio in 1811. When the war of 1812 began, the English decided to attack from Canada into Ohio and merge their forces with the Shawnee. This continued until Tecumseh was killed on an unknown battlefield in 1813. Most of the Shawnee, excluding the Pekowi, or Piqua tribe in Southwest Ohio, were forcibly relocated west. https://schoolworkhelper.net/the-shawnee-tribe-war-of-1812/ In 1812, the United Kingdom and the United States got into a dispute because the UK kept invading American ships, claiming random people to be English draft dodgers and taking them away to fight in the British Royal Navy in the Napoleonic Wars. In addition, British officials operating from Canada harbored and armed the Native Indians into attacking American settlers mainly in an effort to establish a pro-British Indian barrier state in U.S. territory south of the Great Lakes region. After several requests to stop these activities went unanswered, the US invaded Canada, laying siege to the cities of Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, prompting a British military response. Ohio played a key role in the War of 1812, as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in Lake Erie. On September 10, 1813, the Battle of Lake Erie, one of the major battles, took place in Lake Erie near Put-in-Bay, Ohio. The British eventually surrendered to Oliver Hazard Perry. The outcome of the Shawnee War also caused the Red Stick War in Alabama in 1813. Tecumseh had approached several tribes for help beforehand, but all had ignored his pleas, despite support. The Red Sticks, a faction of Shawnee supporters among the Muscogee, or Creek Confederacy, broke loose and began attacking military installations in retaliation to his death. Other Muscogee Creeks who didn't support war took care of the problem themselves before it got out of hand. Thrower. \\"Casualties and Consequences of the Creek Civil War.\\" in Rethinking Tohopeka, 12. =Indian Removals= Ultimately, after the United States government used the Indian Removal Act of 1830 to force countless Native American tribes on the Trail of Tears, where all the southern states except for Florida were successfully emptied of Native peoples, the US government panicked because a majority of tribes did not want to be forced out of their own lands. Fearing further wars between Native tribes and American settlers, they pushed all remaining Native tribes in the East to migrate west against their own will, including all remaining tribes in Ohio. It is said that Ohio may actually have been apart of the Trail of Tears, according to The Other Trail of Tears: The Removal of the Ohio Indians by Mary Stockwell. https://sites.google.com/a/lanepl.org/columns-by-jim- blount/home/2017-articles/what-happened-to-indians-that-once-inhabited-ohio In 1838, the United States sent 7,000 soldiers to remove 16,000 Cherokee by force. Whites looted their homes. The largest Trail of Tears began, eventually taking 4,000 Indian lives. The Removal Act opened 25 million acres to white settlement and slavery. Upper Sandusky‚Äôs traditionalist Wyandot go to Washington, D.C. to try to promote a separate removal agreement, but they are rejected. They return home, and their chief pulls a knife at a tribal council and lands in jail. The final tribe to leave were the Wyandot in 1843. Indian Myths, Elsey Connelley, William pg 60 Industrialization Industrial baron John D. Rockefeller is buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. Throughout much of the 19th century, industry was rapidly introduced to complement an existing agricultural economy. One of the first iron manufacturing plants opened near Youngstown in 1804 called Hopewell Furnace. By the mid-19th century, 48 blast furnaces were operating in the state, most in the southern portions of the state. Discovery of coal deposits aided the further development of the steel industry in the state, and by 1853 Cleveland was the third largest iron and steel producer in the country. The first Bessemer converter was purchased by the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company, which eventually became part of the U.S. Steel Corporation following the merger of Federal Steel Company and Carnegie Steel, the first billion-dollar American corporation. The first open-hearth furnace used for steel production was constructed by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland, and by 1892, Ohio ranked as the 2nd-largest steel producing state behind Pennsylvania. Republic Steel was founded in Youngstown in 1899, and was at one point the nation's third largest producer. Armco, now AK Steel, was founded in Middletown also in 1899. Tobacco processing plants were founded in Dayton by the 1810s and Cincinnati became known as \\"Porkopolis\\" in being the nation's capital of pork processing, and by 1850 it was the third largest manufacturing city in the country. Mills were established throughout the state, including one in Steubenville in 1815 which employed 100 workers. Manufacturers produced farming machinery, including Cincinnati residents Cyrus McCormick, who invented the reaper, and Obed Hussey, who developed an early version of the mower. Columbus became known as the \\"Buggy Capital of the World\\" for its nearly two dozen carriage manufacturers. Dayton became a technological center in the 1880s with the National Cash Register Company. For roughly ten years during the Ohio Oil Rush in the late 19th century, the state enjoyed the position of leading producer of crude oil in the country. By 1884, 86 oil refineries were operating in Cleveland, the home of Standard Oil, making it the \\"oil capital of the world\\", while producing the world's first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller. Pinkerton guards escort strikebreakers in Buchtel, Ohio, 1884. Herbert H. Dow founded the Dow Chemical Company in Cleveland in 1895, today the world's second largest chemical manufacturer. In 1898 Frank Seiberling named his rubber company after the first person to vulcanize rubber, Charles Goodyear, which today is known as Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Seeing the need to replace steel-rimmed carriage tires with rubber, Harvey Firestone started Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and began selling to Henry Ford. The Ohio Automobile Company eventually became known as Packard, while Benjamin Goodrich entered the rubber industry in 1870 in Akron, founding Goodrich, Tew & Company, better known as the Goodrich Corporation in the present era. By the late 19th century, Ohio had become a global industrial center.Ohio: the history of a people, p. 180 Natural resources contributed to the industrial growth, including salt, iron ore, timber, limestone, coal, and natural gas, and the discovery of oil in northwestern Ohio led to the growth of the port of Toledo. By 1908, the state had 9,581 miles of railroad linking coal mines, oil fields, and industries with the world. Commercial enterprise began to prosper around towns with banks. =Innovation= William Procter and James Gamble started a company which produced a high quality, inexpensive soap called Ivory, which is still the best known product today of Procter and Gamble. Michael Joseph Owens invented the first semi-automatic glass-blowing machine while working for the Toledo Glass Company. The company was owned by Edward Libbey, and together the pair would form companies which ultimately became known as Owens-Illinois and Owens Corning. Wilbur and Orville Wright invented the first airplane in Dayton. Charles Kettering invented the first automatic starter for automobiles, and was the co-founder of Delco Electronics, today part of Delphi Corporation. The Battelle Memorial Institute perfected xerography, resulting in the company Xerox. At Cincinnati's Children's Hospital, Albert Sabin developed the first oral polio vaccine, which was administered throughout the world. In 1955, Joseph McVicker tested a wallpaper cleaner in Cincinnati schools, eventually becoming known as the product Play-Doh. The same year the Tappan Stove Company created the first microwave oven made for commercial, home use. James Spangler invented the first commercially successful portable vacuum cleaner, which he sold to The Hoover Company. African American inventors based in Ohio achieved prominence. After witnessing a car and carriage crash, Garrett Morgan invented one of the earliest traffic lights; he was a leader in the Cleveland Association of Colored Men. Frederick McKinley Jones invented refrigeration devices for transportation which ultimately led to the Thermo King Corporation. In Cincinnati, Granville Woods invented the telegraphony, which he sold to a telephone company. John P. Parker of Ripley invented the Parker Pulverizer and screw for tobacco processes. =Infrastructure= Port of Toledo Ohio's economic growth was aided by their pursuit of infrastructure. By the late 1810s, the National Road crossed the Appalachian Mountains, connecting Ohio with the east coast. The Ohio River aided the agricultural economy by allowing farmers to move their goods by water to the southern states and the port of New Orleans. The construction of the Erie Canal in the 1820s allowed Ohio businesses to ship their goods through Lake Erie and to the east coast, which was followed by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal and the connection of Lake Erie with the Ohio River. This gave the state complete water access to the world within the borders of the United States. Other canals included Miami and Erie Canal. The Welland Canal would eventually give the state alternative global routes through Canada. The first railroad in Ohio was a 33-mile line completed in 1836 called the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad, connecting Toledo with Adrian, Michigan. The Ohio Loan Law of 1837 allowed the state to loan one-third of construction costs to businesses, passed initially to aid the construction of canals, but instead used heavily for the construction of railroads. The Little Miami Railroad was granted a state charter in 1836 and was completed in 1848, connecting Cincinnati with Springfield. Construction of a commuter rail began in 1851 called the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad. This allowed the affluent of Cincinnati to move to newly developed communities outside the city along the rail. The Ohio and Mississippi Railroad was given financial support from the city of Cincinnati and eventually connected them with St. Louis, while the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the Appalachians in the mid-1850s and connected the state with the east coast. The investment in infrastructure complemented Ohio's central location and put it at the heart of the nation's transportation system traveling north and south and east and west, and also gave the state a headstart during the national industrialization process which occurred between 1870 and 1920. Water ports sprang up along Lake Erie, including the Port of Ashtabula, Port of Cleveland, Port of Conneaut, Fairport Harbor, Port of Huron, Port of Lorain, Port of Marblehead, Port of Sandusky, and Port of Toledo. The Port of Cincinnati was built on the Ohio River. Following the commercialization of air travel, Ohio became a key route for east to west transportation. The first commercial cargo flight occurred between Dayton and Columbus in 1910. Cleveland Hopkins International Airport was built in 1925 and became home to the first air traffic control tower, ground to air radio control, airfield lighting system, and commuter rail link. The Interstate Highway System brought new travel routes to the state in the mid-20th century, further making Ohio a transportation hub. =Urbanization and commercialization= With the rapid increase of industrialization in the country in the late 19th century, Ohio's population swelled from 2.3 million in 1860 to 4.2 million by 1900. By 1920, nine Ohio cities had populations of 50,000 or more. The rapid urbanization brought about a growth of commercial industries in the state, including many financial and insurance institutions. The National City Corporation was founded in 1845, today part of PNC Financial Services. Cleveland's Society for Savings was founded in 1849, eventually becoming part of KeyBank. The Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in 1858, becoming known as Fifth Third Bank today. City National Bank and Trust Company was founded in 1866 in Columbus, eventually becoming Bank One. The American Financial Group was founded in 1872 and the Western & Southern Financial Group in 1888 in Cincinnati. The Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was founded in Columbus in 1925, today known as the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. Major retail operations emerged in the state, including Kroger in 1883 in Cincinnati, today second only to Walmart. Federated Department Stores was founded in Columbus in 1929, known today as Macy's. The Sherwin-Williams Company was founded in 1866 in Cleveland. Frisch's Big Boy was opened in 1905 in Cincinnati. American Electric Power was founded in Columbus in 1906. The American Professional Football Association was founded in Canton in 1922, eventually becoming the National Football League. The Cleveland Clinic was founded in 1921 and presently is one of the world's leading medical institutions. Education William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library on the campus of the Ohio State University, an anchor of the University System of Ohio, the nation's largest comprehensive public system of higher education Education has been an integral part of Ohio culture since its early days of statehood. In the beginning, mothers usually educated their children at home or paid for their children to attend smaller schools in villages and towns. Early on, the US was interested in creating a national public schooling system, but the irony came to be that, in Ohio, the various religious groups who had settled here refused to allow one another any say in what their own children would be taught, causing the issue to be constantly put on hold. In 1821 the state passed a tax to finance local schools. In 1822, Caleb Atwater lobbied the legislature and Governor Allen Trimble to establish a commission to study the possibility of initiating public, common schools. Atwater modeled his plan after the New York City public school system. After public opinion in 1824 forced the state to find a resolution to the education problem, the legislature established the common school system in 1825 and financed it with a half-million property levy. They ultimately chose to relax state authority over school curriculum and gave Ohio schools regional authority over the matter. It would remain as such until the 20th century, but has caused a fairly erratic, confusing and sometimes lacking schooling experience in some subjects, even if generally adequate to get by. School districts formed, and by 1838 the first direct tax was levied allowing access to school for all. The first appropriation for the common schools came in 1838, a sum of $200,000. The average salary for male teachers in some districts during this early period was $25/month and $12.50/month for females.New Englanders on the Ohio Frontier: Migration and Settlement of Worthington, p. 250 By 1915, the appropriations for the common schools totaled over $28 million. The first middle school in the nation, Indianola Junior High School (now the Graham Expeditionary Middle School), opened in Columbus in 1909. McGuffey Readers was a leading textbook originating from the state and found throughout the nation. Original universities and colleges in the state included the Ohio University, founded in Athens, in 1804, the first university in the old Northwest Territory and ninth-oldest in the United States. Miami University in Oxford, Ohio was founded in 1809, the University of Cincinnati in 1819, Kenyon College in Gambier in 1824, Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1826, Xavier University in Cincinnati and Denison University in Granville in 1831, Oberlin College in 1833, Marietta College in 1835, the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware in 1842, and the University of Dayton in 1850. Wilberforce University was founded in 1856 and the University of Akron and Ohio State University followed in 1870, with the University of Toledo in 1872. The first dental school in the United States was founded in the early 19th century in Bainbridge. The Ohio School for the Blind became the first of its kind in the country, located in Columbus. After 2000, Ohio State government began experimentally exerting more control over schools, as they attempted to help the state's education system evolve with the times. As of 2020, it largely seems to have done just as much harm as good and re-exposed a lot of the issues inherent in how Ohio schooling was originally organized, which they are now desperately trying to solve. https://apnews.com/f920dd9b327dbd93c5de971841438b8a https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/ In 2007, Governor Ted Strickland signed legislation organizing the University System of Ohio, the nation's largest comprehensive public system of higher education. Social history =Religion= Rural Ohio in the 19th century was noted for its religious diversity, tolerance and pluralism, according to Smith (1991). With so many active denominations, no one dominated and, increasingly, tolerance became the norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the Second Great Awakening spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches in the cities.Timothy L. Smith, \\"The Ohio Valley: Testing Ground for America's Experiment in Religious Pluralism\\", Church History, December 1991, Vol. 60 Issue 4, pp 461‚Äì479, in JSTOR During the Progressive Era, Washington Gladden was a leader of the Social Gospel movement in Ohio. He was the editor of the influential national magazine the Independent after 1871, and as pastor of the First Congregational Church of Columbus, Ohio from 1882 to his death in 1918. Gladden crusaded for Prohibition, resolving conflicts between labor and capital; he often denounced racial violence and lynching.Paul Boyer, \\"An Ohio Leader of the Social Gospel Movement,\\" Ohio History, August 2009, Vol. 116, pp 88‚Äì100 =Ethnic groups= Early Ohio state culture was a product of Native American cultures, which were pushed away between 1795 and 1843. Many of Native American descent did remain, but had often converted to some form of Christianity, and/ or married into European descended families, so the cultures themselves did not last here. This was especially exasperated in the late 19th century, when racial violence against all sorts of people- including Native Americans- reached such a horrifying peak nationwide, that most such people went out of their ways to seem as white as possible. https://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/reconstruction/section6/ It was easier for people who were only part Native, as most Ohioans no longer knew what such people really looked like and their skin was fair enough that they could claim Italian, Hispanic or Greek descent and disappear into those communities. Still, Ohio does have plenty today who claim Iroquoian, Lenape, Chippewa, Shawnee, Cherokee (usually Shattara/ Shenandoah, not really Cherokee) or Blackfoot (Saponi-Tutelo and Manahoac) descent and are proud of it. The northeastern part of Ohio was settled by Yankees from Connecticut, and pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania. The Connecticut Western Reserve became the center for modernization and reform.The Magazine of American history with notes and queries, Volume 16, p. 526-529 They were sophisticated, educated, and open minded, as well as religious. Some of the original settlers from Connecticut were Amos Loveland, a revolutionary soldier, and Jacob Russell. They faced a rough wilderness life, where the common living arrangement was the log cabin. As the pioneer culture faded in the mid-19th century, Ohio had over 140,000 citizens of native New England origin, including New York.The expansion of New England: the spread of New England settlement and institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620‚Äì1865, p. 193-194 One of the New Yorkers who came to the state during this period was Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, whose church in Kirtland was the home of the movement for a period of time. Other early pioneers came from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially Pennsylvania and Virginia, some settling on military grant lands in the Virginia Military District. From Virginia came members of the Harrison family of Virginia, who rose to prominence in the state, producing Ohio's first of eight U.S. Presidents. William Henry Harrison's campaign of 1840 came to represent the pioneer culture of Ohio, symbolized by his Log cabin campaign. The theme song of his campaign, the \\"Log Cabin Song,\\" was authored by Otway Curry, who was a nationally known poet and author. Ohio was largely agricultural before 1850, although gristmills and local forges were present. Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location ‚Äì or \\"market-minded agrarianism\\" ‚Äì and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.Ginette Aley, \\"A Republic of Farm People: Women, Families, and Market-Minded Agrarianism in Ohio, 1820s‚Äì1830s,\\" Ohio History, (2007) 114#1 pp 28‚Äì45, online Large numbers of German Americans arrived from Pennsylvania, augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their villages from this period included the German Village in Columbus. They also founded the villages of Gnadenhutten in the late 18th century; Bergholz, New Bremen, New Berlin, Dresden, and other villages and towns. The German Americans immigrating from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially eastern Pennsylvania, brought with them the Midland dialect, which is still found throughout much of Ohio. For instance, in Philadelphia water is pronounced with a long o versus the normal short o, the same as in many areas of Ohio. African Americans of the Underground Railroad began coming to the state, some settling, others passing through on the way to Canada. Universities and colleges opened up all over the state, creating a more educated culture. Entertainer Bob Hope was an immigrant from Britain who grew up in Cleveland. By the last half of the 19th century, the state became more diverse culturally with new immigrants from Europe, including Ireland and Germany. The Forty-Eighters from Central Europe settled the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood in Cincinnati, while the Irish immigrants settled throughout the state, including Flytown in Columbus. Other immigrants from Russia, Turkey, China, Japan, Finland, Greece, Italy, Romania, Poland, and other places came in the latter years.The American Midwest: an interpretive encyclopedia, p. 228‚Äì231 Around the start of the 20th century, rural southern European Americans and African Americans came north in search of better economic opportunity, infusing Hillbilly culture into the state. Newer ethnic villages emerged, including the Slavic Village in Cleveland and the Italian Village and Hungarian Village in Columbus. Howard Chandler Christy, born in Morgan County, became a leading American artist during this century, as well as composer Dan Emmett, founder of the Blackface tradition. Ohio's mines factories and cities attracted Europeans. Irish Catholics poured in to construct the canals, railroads, streets and sewers in the 1840s and 1850s. After 1880, the coal mines and steel plants attracted families from southern and eastern Europe. A large influx of people moving into Ohio from neighboring West Virginia and Kentucky also occurred. The sparsely populated regions of Appalachia had largely been stripped of resources by logging and mining companies, leaving little and few prospects for the locals. Steel and rubber manufacturers were even known to scout these regions for new workers and invested in infrastructure and the building of new suburbs to lure them in. Places like Akron, OH were almost single-handedly built this way, as the modern city was only a small town prior to the early-mid 20th century. By 1901, the Midwest (Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio) had absorbed 5.8 million foreign immigrants and another million by 1912. Immigration was cut off by the World War in 1914, allowing the ethnic communities to Americanize, grow much more prosperous, served in the military, and abandon possible plans to return to the old country.Josef Barton, Immigration and Social Mobility in an American City: Studies of Three Ethnic Groups in Cleveland 1890‚Äì1950 (1971) Flows were very low between 1925 and 1965, then began to increase again, this time with many arrivals from Asia and Mexico. Since then, there were larger influxes from the Jewish community, following World War II and a spike in the numbers of Middle Easterners following successive conflicts in the region during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Ohio has also become a common destination for foreign college students worldwide, with many choosing to remain in the state after. While Ohio has been the most like a \\"Melting Pot\\" than most other places in the US, whereas virtually all arriving cultures largely merged into a homogenous group with very little distinction[citation needed], aside religion, there has been growing public interest in recent years of people returning to their ancestors' roots, forming extraneous shared-culture communities within larger communities, and to ultimately become more of a \\"mosaic.\\"[citation needed] =Popular culture= Industrialization brought a shift culturally as urbanization and an emerging middle class changed society. Athletics became increasingly popular as the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds, started playing at that level in 1869, and football leagues emerged. Bathhouses and rollercoasters became a popular past time with the opening of Cedar Point in 1870. Theaters and saloons sprang up, and more restaurants opened. Entertainment venues opening in Cleveland included the Playhouse Square Center, Palace Theatre, Ohio Theatre, State Theatre, and the Karamu House. Langston Hughes grew up in Cleveland and developed many of his plays at the Karamu House. In Columbus they opened the Southern Theatre in 1894, as well as their own Palace Theatre and Ohio Theatre, which hosted performers such as Jack Benny, Judy Garland, and Jean Harlow. The Lincoln Theatre hosted performers like Count Basie. The Taft Theatre opened in 1928 in Cincinnati. The Roaring Twenties brought prohibition, bootlegging and speakeasies to the state, as well as the swing dance culture. Cincinnati became the headquarters of the \\"king of bootlegging\\" George Remus, who made $40 million by the end of 1922. The Anti-Saloon League had been powerful and Ohio, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union was still headquartered there; the Ku Klux Klan was active in the 1920s. However these organizations steadily lost influence after 1925. Perhaps the biggest invention in Ohio and the US was the invention of flight by Dayton's Orville and Wilbur Wright. Starting this invention in their bike shop in what is now Dayton's west side, the Wright's brought flight to the world in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio- based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice. From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers. The very first airplane passenger was the Wright's own mechanic, Charles Furnas of West Milton, Ohio. =Depression years= During the 1930s, the Great Depression struck the state hard. American Jews watched the rise of the Third Reich with apprehension. Cleveland residents Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created the Superman comic character in the spirit of the Jewish golem. Many of their comics portrayed Superman fighting and defeating the Nazis. Artists, writers, musicians and actors developed in the state and often moved to other cities which were larger centers for their work. They included Zane Grey, Milton Caniff, George Bellows, Art Tatum, Roy Lichtenstein, and \\"king of the cowboys\\" Roy Rogers. Alan Freed, who emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live rock 'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952. Famous filmmakers include Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus and the original Warner Brothers, who set up their first movie theatre in Youngstown, OH before that company later relocated to California. The state produced many popular musicians, including Dean Martin, Doris Day, The O'Jays, Marilyn Manson, Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters fame, Devo, Macy Gray and The Isley Brothers. The NFL was originally founded in Ohio and the state has since given us many famous stars across various sports. Other famous individuals- native Ohioans and those who were just later associated with the state- include Annie Oakley, Clarence Darrow, Thomas Edison, Niel Armstrong and less beloved figures, like President William McKinley and General George Custer. Civil War Monument in Hillsboro During the Civil War (1861‚Äì65) Ohio played a key role in providing troops, military officers, and supplies to the Union army. Due to its central location and burgeoning population, Ohio was both politically and logistically important to the war effort. Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful Republican politicians, it was divided politically. Portions of Southern Ohio followed the Peace Democrats under Clement Vallandigham and openly opposed President Lincoln's policies. Ohio played an important part in the Underground Railroad prior to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during the war years.Robert S. Harper, Ohio Handbook of the Civil War (Ohio Historical Society, 1961), pp. 4‚Äì15. The third most populous state in the Union at the time, Ohio raised nearly 320,000 soldiers for the Union army, third behind only New York and Pennsylvania. Nearly 7,000 Buckeye soldiers were killed in action.Whitelaw Reid, Ohio in the War: Her Statesmen, Her Generals, and Soldiers (1868) Vol. 1, p. 160; Several leading generals were from the state, including Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and Philip H. Sheridan. Only two minor battles were fought within its borders. Morgan's Raid in the summer of 1863 alarmed the populace.Dee A. Brown, Morgan's Raiders. New York : Konecky & Konecky, 1959. Ohio troops fought in nearly every major campaign during the war. =Prison camps= Its most significant Civil War site is Johnson's Island, located in Sandusky Bay of Lake Erie. Barracks and outbuildings were constructed for a prisoner of war depot, intended chiefly for officers. Over three years more than 15,000 Confederate men were held there. The island includes a Confederate cemetery where about 300 men were buried. Camp Chase Prison was a Union Army prison in Columbus. There was a plot among prisoners to revolt and escape in 1863. The prisoners expected support from Copperheads and Vallandigham, but never did revolt.Angela M. Zombek, \\"Camp Chase Prison,\\" Ohio History, (2011) 118#1 pp 24‚Äì48 =Veterans= Home of Jacob Parrott in Kenton, the first Medal of Honor recipient, now a historical museum Ohio has been involved in regional, national, and global wars since statehood, and veterans have been a powerful social and political force at the local and state levels. The organization of Civil War veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic, was a major player in local society and Republican politics in the last third of the 19th century. The American Veterans of Foreign Service was established in 1899 in Columbus, ultimately becoming known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1913. The state has produced 319 Medal of Honor recipients, including the country's first recipient, Jacob Parrott. In 1886, the state authorized the creation of the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky and a second one created in 2003 in Georgetown to provide for soldiers facing economic hardship. Over 50,000 veterans have lived at the Sandusky location as of 2005. Since World War I, the state has paid stipends to veterans of wars, including in 2009, authorizing funds for soldiers of the Gulf and Afghanistan wars. The state also provides free in-state tuition to any veteran regardless of state origin at their colleges. Politics =Rebellion of 1820= In 1820, the legislature then passed legislation which nullified the federal court order as well as the operations of the Bank of the United States within their borders.Cyclopaedia of political science, political economy, and of the political history of the United States, p. 1050 The state ignored further federal court orders, writs, and denied immunities to the federal government. Their actions were considered the complete destruction of federal standing in the state and an attempted overthrow of the federal government.The century illustrated monthly magazine, Volume 37, p. 873 Ohio forcefully applied their iron law against the federal government until 1824, when the United States Supreme Court ruled they had no authority to tax the federal bank in the landmark case originating from the state: Osborn v. Bank of the United States. They then followed by passing an act in 1831 to withdraw state protections for the Bank of the United States.Ohio arch√¶ological and historical quarterly, Volume 2, p. 413‚Äì420. Although the nullification of 1820 in Ohio was inspired by resolutions passed in Virginia and Kentucky in 1798 and 1800, the language of their resolution from 1820 would find its place in South Carolina's nullification of 1832 and secession articles of southern states in 1861.Ohio history, Volume 2, p. 421 =Sovereignty= The rebellion of 1820 firmly rooted the tradition of sovereignty in the state. In 1859, Governor Salmon P. Chase reaffirmed that tradition, stating: \\"We have rights which the Federal Government must not invade ‚Äî rights superior to its power, on which our sovereignty depends; and we mean to assert those rights against all tyrannical assumptions of authority.\\"The Democratic party: a political study, p. 61 Following the War of the Rebellion, the debate over ratification of the Reconstruction Amendments reignited the sovereignty movement in Ohio. General Durbin Ward stated: \\"Fellow citizens of Ohio, I boldly assert that the States of this Union have always had, both before and since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, entire sovereignty over the whole subject of suffrage in all its relations and bearings. Ohio has that sovereignty now, and it cannot be taken from her...\\"The life of Rutherford Birchard Hayes: nineteenth president of the United States, Volume 1, p. 359 As recently as 2009, the tradition re-emerged, with an Ohio sovereignty resolution passing in the state senate, and signatures being collected to place a state sovereignty amendment on the ballot in 2011. =Anti-slavery= Uncle Tom's Cabin, written by Harriett Beecher Stowe, was based on experiences of the Underground Railroad in Cincinnati. Ohio's roots as an anti-slavery and abolitionist state go back to its territorial days in the Northwest Territory, which forbade the practice. When it became a state, the constitution expressly outlawed slavery. Many Ohioans were members of anti-slavery organizations, including the American Anti-Slavery Society and American Colonization Society. Ohioan Charles Osborn published the first abolitionist newspaper in the country, The Philanthropist, and in 1821, the father of abolition Benjamin Lundy began publishing his newspaper the Genius of Universal Emancipation. Ohio was a key stop on the Underground Railroad where prominent abolitionists played a role, including John Rankin. Ohio resident Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the famous book Uncle Tom's Cabin, which was largely influential in shaping the opinion of the north against slavery. =Ohio in national politics= As a closely contested state, Ohio was the top choice of Republicans, and often also as Democrats, for place on the national ticket as candidate for president or vice president. Between Lincoln and Hoover, every Republican president who did not gain the office by the death of his predecessor was born in Ohio; Ulysses Grant, although born in Ohio, was legally a residence of Illinois when he was elected. By electing so many of her sons to the presidency, Ohio gained a role in politics disproportionate to its size. Several reasons came together. Ohio was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was \\"Available\\"‚Äîthat is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states of New York or Pennsylvania. This legend built on itself as the state sent seven men to the White House and four more became vice president. Many others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the most federal officeholders. Ohio-born Rutherford B. Hayes (1876), James A. Garfield (1880) and Benjamin Harrison (1888) were each nominated from a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, \\"the potency of the Ohio myth gave its favorite sons a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention\\". =Progressive era= U.S. Second Lady Cornelia Cole Fairbanks was a powerful progressive operative around the start of the 20th century who helped pave the way for the modern American female politician. The Progressive Era brought about change in the state, although the state had been at the forefront of the movement decades before. In 1852, Ohio passed its first child labor laws, and in 1885 adopted prosecution powers for violations.Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 25, p. 472 In 1886, the American Federation of Labor was formed in Columbus, culminating in the passage of workers' compensation laws by the early 20th century.The Ohio State Constitution: a reference guide, p. 152 Women's rights Victoria Woodhull, the first female candidate for U.S. president in 1872, and U.S. Second Lady Cornelia Cole Fairbanks, credited with paving the way for the modern American female politician, were leaders in the women's suffrage movement. Ohio was the second state to hold a women's rights convention, the Ohio Women's Convention at Salem in 1850.Wellman, Judith (2008). \\"The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention and the Origin of the Women's Rights Movement\\", pp. 15, 84. National Park Service, Women's Rights National Historical Park. Wellman is identified as the author of this document here . The first two women's rights conventions were the Seneca Falls Convention and the Rochester Convention, both held in 1848 in western New York. The public voted on women's suffrage in 1912, which failed, but the state ultimately adopted the 19th amendment in 1920. Ohio-native and U.S. President William Howard Taft signed the White- Slave Traffic Act in 1910, which sought to end human trafficking and the sex slave trade. The Anti-Saloon League was founded in 1893 in Oberlin, which saw political success with the passage of the Volstead Act in 1918. =Constitutional Convention of 1912= In 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with Charles Burleigh Galbreath as Secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the Progressive Era. The constitution introduced the initiative and the referendum, and provided for the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases. =Ku Klux Klan= In the early 1920s the Ku Klux Klan attracted thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and corrupt politicians. The Klan collapsed and virtually disappeared in Ohio after 1925. =Great Depression= Ohio was hit especially hard by the Great Depression in the 1930s. In 1932, unemployment for the state reached 37.3%. By 1933, 40% of factory workers and 67% of construction labor were unemployed. The state had previously supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, 1936, 1940, but his policies had grown out of favor with the state and they voted against him in 1944. =World War II= Ohio played a major role in World War II, especially in providing manpower, food, and munitions to the Allied cause. Ohio manufactured 8.4 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking fourth among the 48 states.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p. 111 =Cold War= Ohio became heavily anti-Communist during the Cold War following World War II. Time Magazine reported in 1950 that police officers in Columbus were warning youth clubs to be suspicious of communist agitators. Campbell Hill in Bellefontaine became the site of a main U.S. Cold War base and a precursor to NORAD. Anti-communist personalities emerged from the state, including Janet Greene of Columbus, the political right's answer to Joan Baez. Her songs included \\"Commie Lies\\", \\"Poor Left Winger\\", and \\"Comrade's Lament\\". Ohio was the scene of the Kent State Massacre, where four anti-Vietnam war protesters, part of a charging mob, were shot dead, by badly frightened and poorly trained guardsmen. As the cold war wrapped up, Ohio heavily supported the elections of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his peace-work contributions toward ending the conflict, who is the name-bearer of a highway in the Cincinnati area. Ohio became an industrial magnet in the 1950s. By 1960, 10% of the population had been born in nearby Kentucky, West Virginia or Tennessee. Un-American activities The Ohio Un-American Activities Committee was a government agency which existed to collect information on citizens with communist sympathies, resulting in 15 convictions, 40 indictments, and 1,300 suspects. Governor Frank Lausche generally opposed the committee, but his vetoes were overridden by the legislature. The state forced their employees to sign a loyalty oath, promising \\"to defend the state against foreign and domestic enemies\\", in order to receive a paycheck. Professors and Holocaust survivors Bernhard Blume and Oskar Seidlin were among those required to take the oath.Goethe in German-Jewish culture, p. 133 Ohio barred communists from receiving unemployment benefits.A conspiracy so immense: the world of Joe McCarthy, p. 140 Late 20th century to present A Third Frontier summit in 2002 at Hyland Software in Westlake Ohioans have supported movie making. Five Academy Award-winning films of the late 20th century were partly produced in the state, including The Deer Hunter, Rain Man, Silence of the Lambs, Terms of Endearment, and Traffic. In the 21st century, Ohio remains connected to the regional, national, and global economies. According to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, the foreign-born share of Ohio's population increased from 2.4% in 1990, to 3.0% in 2000, to 4.1% in 2013.Fact Sheet: New Americans in Ohio: The Political and Economic Power of Immigrants, Latinos, and Asians in the Buckeye State, American Immigration Council (January 1, 2015). As of 2015, 49.7% of immigrants to Ohio had become naturalized U.S. citizens. Immigrants have substantial economic importance to Ohio, as taxpayers, entrepreneurs, consumers, and workers.Encarnacion Pyle, Report: Foreign-born workers important to Ohio, U.S. economy, Columbus Dispatch (August 4, 2016). A 2016 study on immigrants in Ohio concluded that immigrants make up 6.7% of all entrepreneurs in Ohio although they are just 4.2% of Ohio's population, and that these immigrant-owned businesses generated almost $532 million in 2014. The study also showed that \\"immigrants in Ohio earned $15.6 billion in 2014 and contributed $4.4 billion in local, state and federal taxes that year.\\" In 2015, Ohio gross domestic product (a broad measure of the size of the economy) was $608.1 billion, the seventh-largest economy among the 50 states.Ohio Facts 2016: Ohio's Economy Ranks 7th Largest Among States , Ohio Legislative Service Commission. In 2015, Ohio's total GDP accounted for 3.4% of U.S. GDP and 0.8% of world GDP. Ohio's GDP per capita in 2015 was $52,363, ranked 26th among the states in GDP per capita. From 2005 to 2015, \\" Ohio's economy grew more slowly than the U.S. as a whole, growing at an average nominal (i.e., not inflation-adjusted) annual rate of 2.6%, compared to the U.S. average annual growth rate of 3.2% over the same time period. From 2000 to 2016, \\"the pace of employment growth in Ohio has trailed the national pace..., except for the three-year period between 2010 and 2013.\\" Ohio had become nicknamed the \\"fuel cell corridor\\" in being a contributing anchor for the region now called the \\"Green Belt,\\" in reference to the growing renewable energy sector. Although the state experienced heavy manufacturing losses around the start of the 20th century and suffered from the Great Recession, it was rebounding by the second decade in being the country's 6th-fastest-growing economy through the first half of 2010. Politically the state has demonstrated its importance in modern presidential elections, signed international cooperation treaties with foreign provinces and northern American states, has become involved in heated national disputes with southern American states, while producing national leadership. Its athletic teams are among some of the nation's best, and culturally the state continues to produce notable artists while building institutions enshrining its past. Educationally the schools are among the nation's top performers, and militarily Ohio's legacy continues into the present era. Ohio's transition into the 21st century is symbolized by the Third Frontier program, spearheaded by Governor Bob Taft around the start of the 20th century. This built on the agricultural and industrial pillars of the economy, the first and second frontiers, by aiding the growth of advanced technology industries, the third frontier. It has been widely hailed as one of the nation's most successful government bureaucracies, attracting 637 new high-tech companies to the state and 55,000 new jobs, with an average of salary of $65,000, while having a $6.6 billion economic impact with an investment return ratio of 9:1. In 2010 the state won the International Economic Development Council's Excellence in Economic Development Award, celebrated as a national model of success. The state's cities have become hubs of modern industry, including Toledo's recognition as a national solar center,\\"Five cities that will rise in the New Economy\\", Christian Science Monitor. Retrieved November 27, 2009. Cleveland a regenerative medicine research hub,\\"Atlantic Eye: Brunner is the best for Ohio\\" , Marc S. Ellenbogen. May 3, 2010. Retrieved 5 May 2010. Dayton an aerospace and defense hub, Akron the rubber capital of the world, Columbus a technological research and development hub, and Cincinnati a mercantile hub. Ohio was hit hard by the Great Recession and manufacturing employment losses during the most recent period. The recession cost the state 376,500 jobs and it had 89,053 foreclosures in 2009, a record for the state. The median household income dropped 7% and the poverty rate ballooned to 13.5% by 2009. By the second half of 2010, the state showed signs of rebound in being the nation's sixth- fastest-growing economy. During the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, the state was at the center of the political world as a key battleground which in the elections of U.S. President George W. Bush. U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner of southwestern Ohio became a national political leader. Beginning in the 1980s, the state entered into international economic and resource cooperation treaties and organizations with other Midwestern states, New York, Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Quebec, including the Great Lakes Charter, Great Lakes Compact, and the Council of Great Lakes Governors. It became involved in heated national disputes with southern American states in 2009 and 2010, including Georgia over National Cash Register Company and Alabama over Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where southern lawmakers were accused of misusing federal funds and influence to \\"steal\\" Ohio jobs during the Great Recession.Ohio Lawmakers Question NCR Move Athletically, the state's teams are among some of the nation's best. The Ohio State University football team won the national championship in 2002 and 2014, and consistently competes for the prize annually. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series championship in 1990 following their run as the Big Red Machine in the 1970s, as well as the National League Central Division champions in 2010 and 2012, while the Cincinnati Bengals appeared in the Super Bowl in 1981 and 1988 and have won the AFC North Division in 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2015. In 2016 the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA Finals, in 2007 won the Eastern Conference Championship, and in 2009 and 2010 won the NBA Central Division championships. The Columbus Quest won the only two league championships in history in the 1990s, while the Ohio State University men's basketball team advanced to the NCAA Final Four and national championship game in 2007. In 1995 the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame museum opened in Cleveland, commemorating Ohio's contributory past to the art, including being the location of the first live rock 'n roll concert in 1952. Ohio has six of the top 146 public school national universities in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2020 rankings. In 2008 it was ranked 8th by the same magazine for best high schools.\\"Best High Schools: State by State Statistics\\", U.S. News & World Report, Retrieved December 2, 2009. Overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked 5th in the country by Education Week.\\"State Report Cards\\", Education Week, Retrieved February 20, 2010. Militarily, Ohio's legacy continues into the modern era. It has contributed over 200,000 soldiers to the Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars.

It opened in 1985 and shortly became a live music venue. It was an integral part of the so-called toilet circuit and the Newport music scene, particularly catering to fans of rock music. The club was given the moniker \\"The Legendary TJ's by Radio 1 DJ John Peel. TJ's closed on the death of owner John Sicolo, but his grandson Ashley now runs a similar venue named El Sieco's on nearby Market Street, which pays tribute to the sounds and interior features from the original venue.  Early form  John Sicolo started the venue with his then wife Vivienne in 1971 as a restaurant named \\"Cedar's Rest\\" before becoming a burger bar named \\"The Pittsburg Diner\\". Sicolo bought the premises in 1973 and extended into an adjoining property to form the nightclub \\"El Sieco's\\", during which time a variety of musical artists, including local folk acts, performed at the premises.  Etymology  Some sources have suggested the venue was named using the initials of founder John Sicolo's two most important people, his sister Jeanette Sicolo, and partner Trilby Tucker, forming Trilby and Jeanette. However others have indicated the name is a combination of Sicolo's and Tucker's, as it was Tucker was apparently the person who established TJ's as a live music venue on the premises in 1985, naming it Trilby and John's. A further proposed connection exists which claims it was his daughter, Janet Sicolo, who worked with Sicolo's partner, Tucker, to save the club from bankruptcy in the 1980s, and as a result the name was changed from Sieco's to TJ's, meaning Trilby and Janet. Trilby reportedly owned TJ's until her death in 1993 however media reports indicate John would then survive her ownership in the 2000s.  History  = Oasis = On 3 May 1994, the then up-and-coming Manchester band Oasis performed at TJ's following a small venue tour of the UK. The band were in South Wales frequently that year, recording at Loco Studios near Usk and Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, and had begun performing shortly after the release of their single \\"Supersonic\\". In a setup similar to the present day Clwb Ifor Bach, the band played to the Newport crowd on an un-raised stage, practically level with the crowd. The band performed with local group 60 Ft. Dolls, and among the concert goers were members of the Manic Street Preachers. It was later that week that Liam Gallagher was photographed for their first NME cover in Newport's King's Hotel on High Street. = 1990s and 2000s = Catatonia filmed their single \\"Mulder and Scully\\" at the venue. It is allegedly the place that Kurt Cobain proposed to Courtney Love. Other bands who have played at TJ's early in their careers include The Manic Street Preachers, Green Day, The Offspring, Lostprophets, Iron Maiden, The Stone Roses, Muse, Primal Scream, Descendents, NOFX, Misfits, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Lagwagon, The Bouncing Souls, The Vandals, The Ataris, and Skunk Anansie.Domino records on TJ's In 2002, Jeff Killed John (forerunner band of Bullet for my Valentine) released their EP You/Play with Me through radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. = Popularity and fate = TJ's was voted one of the top 50 'Big Nights Out' in the world by FHM in December 1997. John Sicolo, owner of the club throughout its period of popularity, died on 14 March 2010, aged 66. A tribute concert in his honour, headlined by Goldie Looking Chain, was held in the city's John Frost Square on 10 July 2010. On 15 September 2011 TJ's was sold at auction for ¬£242,000.TJ's Sold at Auction In 2019 it was announced that the property was to become a 58-bedroom hotel, after councillors unanimously backed redevelopment plans. The development will restore the Grade II listed buildings facing onto Clarence Place, which have fallen into disrepair in recent years.https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/17689423.tjs- in-newport-to-become-a-58-bed-hotel/  El Sieco's  El Sieco's, on Market Street, Newport, features similar sounds and design cues from the original TJ's. The venue is adorned with salvaged memorabilia and features from TJ's premises on Clarence Place. It has been run by John Sicolo's grandson, Ashley since 2016.

Subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and, \\"the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols. Following penetration, and parallel with the forced disintegration of political and social institutions of the state, these loyalties may be detached and transferred to the political or ideological cause of the aggressor\\". Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk, cost, and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency. Furthermore, it is a relatively cheap form of warfare that does not require large amounts of training. A subversive is something or someone carrying the potential for some degree of subversion. In this context, a \\"subversive\\" is sometimes called a \\"traitor\\" with respect to (and usually by) the government in power. Subversion, however, is also often a goal of comedians, artists and people in those careers. In this case, being subversive can mean questioning, poking fun at, and undermining the established order in general. When a comedy or comic is referred to as being subversive, it is as much of a compliment to their work as it could be an accusation, from comics like Charlie Chaplin, Lenny Bruce, Andy Kaufman and Stephen Colbert to writers like Paddy Chayefsky, Larry Charles and Mel Brooks, to activists like Abbie Hoffman, and Michael Moore, to artists like The Yes Men and monochrom. Satire is one of the most potent forms of subversion for artists and comics, and it can take shape in films, television, books, and even political protest. Terrorist groups generally do not employ subversion as a tool to achieve their goals. Subversion is a manpower-intensive strategy and many groups lack the manpower and political and social connections to carry out subversive activities. However, actions taken by terrorists may have a subversive effect on society. Subversion can imply the use of insidious, dishonest, monetary, or violent methods to bring about such change. Iraqi troops put up a poster of wanted insurgents. This is in contrast to protest, a coup d'√©tat, or working through traditional means in a political system to bring about change. Furthermore, external subversion is where, \\"the aggressor state attempts to recruit and assist indigenous political and military actors to overthrow their government by coup d‚Äô√©tat\\". If subversion fails in its goal of bringing about a coup it is possible that the actors and actions of the subversive group could transition to insurrection, insurgency, and/or guerilla warfare.Kitson, Frank, Low Intensity Operations: Subversion, Insurgency and Peacekeeping (London: Faber and Faber Limited, 1971), Pg. 6. The word is present in all languages of Latin origin, originally applying to such events as the military defeat of a city. As early as the 14th century, it was being used in the English language with reference to laws, and in the 15th century came to be used with respect to the realm. The term has taken over from 'sedition' as the name for illicit rebellion, though the connotations of the two words are rather different; sedition suggesting overt attacks on institutions, subversion something much more surreptitious, such as eroding the basis of belief in the status quo or setting people against each other. Definition The problem with defining the term subversion is that there is not a single definition that is universally accepted. Charles Townshend described subversion as a term, \\"so elastic as to be virtually devoid of meaning, and its use does little more than convey the enlarged sense of the vulnerability of modern systems to all kinds of covert assaults\\".Rosenau, Subversion and Insurgency, Pg. 4. What follows are some of the many attempts to define the term: > \\"Subversion is the undermining or detachment of the loyalties of significant > political and social groups within the victimized state, and their > transference, under ideal conditions, to the symbols and institutions of the > aggressor.\\" > \\"Subversion ‚Äî Actions designed to undermine the military, economic, > psychological, or political strength or morale of a governing authority.\\" > \\"Subversive Activity ‚Äî Anyone lending aid, comfort, and moral support to > individuals, groups, or organizations that advocate the overthrow of > incumbent governments by force and violence is subversive and is engaged in > subversive activity. All willful acts that are intended to be detrimental to > the best interests of the government and that do not fall into the > categories of treason, sedition, sabotage, or espionage will be placed in > the category of subversive activity.\\" > \\"Subversive Political Action ‚Äî A planned series of activities designed to > accomplish political objectives by influencing, dominating, or displacing > individuals or groups who are so placed as to affect the decisions and > actions of another government.\\" > Subversion ‚Äî \\"A destructive, aggressive activity aimed to destroy the > country, nation, or geographical area of your enemy... [by demoralizing the > cultural values and changing the population's perception of reality]. > Subversion ‚Äî Roger Trinquier defined subversion as a term that could be > lumped together under the name modern warfare, \\"as being interlocking > systems of actions, political, economic, psychological and military that > aims at the overthrow of established authority in a country.\\"Kitson, 1971, > Pg. 5. Conceptual understanding Defining and understanding subversion means identifying entities, structures, and things that can be subverted. Furthermore, it may help to identify practices and tools that are not subversive. Institutions and morals can be subverted, but ideology on the other hand cannot.Beilenson, Laurence, Power Through Subversion (Washington, D.C.: Public Affairs Press, 1972), Pg. v ‚Äìvi. The fall of a government or the creation of a new government as a result of an external war is not subversion. Espionage does not count as subversion because it is not an action that leads directly to an overthrow of a government. Information gathered from espionage may be used to plan and carry out subversive activities.Beilenson, 1972, pg. vi. To gain an understanding of what is considered to be subversive requires understanding the intent of those taking action. This makes defining and identifying subversion a difficult process. As Laurence Beilenson points out, \\"to criticize a government in an effort to reform it or to change its policies is not subversion, even though such criticism may contribute to overthrow. But criticism intended to help a projected overthrow becomes subversive without regard to whether it is right or wrong.\\"Beilenson, 1972, pg. v. Types Subversion can generally be broken down into internal and external subversion, but this distinction is not meant to imply that each follows a specific set of unique and separate tools and practices. Each subversive campaign is different because of the social, political, economic, cultural, and historical differences that each country has. Subversive activities are employed based upon an evaluation of these factors. This breakdown merely clarifies who the actors are. While the subversive actors may be different, the soon to be subverted targets are the same. As Paul Blackstock identifies, the ruling and political elites are the ultimate targets of persuasion because they control the physical instruments of state power.Blackstock, 1964, 57. Internal subversion is actions taken by those within a country and can be used as a tool of power. In most cases the use or threat of force is the last step of internal subversion.Beilenson, 1972, pg. v‚Äìvi. External subversion is actions taken by another country in cooperation with those inside the subverted country and can be used as a tool of statecraft. Foreign volunteers from another country are not enough to qualify for external subversion. The reason for this is that the individuals may legitimately share the cause of the internal subversive dissidents and have legitimately volunteered. Only when the government itself furnishes a nation with money, arms, supplies, or other help to dissidents can it be called external subversion.Beilenson, 1972, pg. vii. Tools and practices left Subversive actions can generally be grouped into three interrelated categories: * Establishing front groups and penetrating and manipulating existing political parties * Infiltrating the armed forces, the police, and other institutions of the state, as well as important non-government organizations * Generating civil unrest through demonstrations, strikes, and boycotts.Rosenau, Subversion, pg. 6. Other factors, while not specifically falling into these categories, may also be useful to subversive dissidents. Additionally, many tools may overlap into other groups of tools as well. As an example, subversives may infiltrate an organization for cultural subversion more so than for control. Civil unrest may be used to provoke the government into a violent response. =Infiltration and establishing front groups= In order for a group to be successful in subverting a government, the group itself and its ideas must be seen as an acceptable alternative to the status quo. However, groups that work toward subverting a government, in many cases, follow ideas and promote goals that on their surface would not receive the support of the population. Therefore, \\"to gain public credibility, attract new supporters, generate revenue, and acquire other resources, groups need to undertake political activities that are entirely separate, or appear separate, from the overtly violent activities of those groups. Sometimes this is achieved by infiltrating political parties, labor unions, community groups, and charitable organizations\\". Infiltrating organizations is an important tool because these institutions are already seen as legitimate in the eyes of the people and provide a platform to express their ideas. When infiltrating, the dissident identifies needs of the organization and then links those needs to solutions that his ideology can provide. This was a technique that the Communist Party USA employed. Once the organization has been co-opted, the dissident can then move on to establishing ties with other groups.Budenz, Louis. The Techniques of Communism. (Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1954), Pg. 155. Furthermore, in addition to gaining possible legitimacy for its ideas the infiltration of these groups can, \\"bolster political allies, attack government policies, and attract international support\\".Rosenau, Subversion, pg. 6 If some organizations are too difficult to infiltrate, it may be necessary to create new organizations that appear to be independent but are actually under the direction of the subversive group. The infiltration of state organizations can provide subversive groups the opportunity to do many things to achieve their goals. The infiltration of security forces can provide information about the government's capabilities and how they plan to address the group's activities. Infiltration also provides the opportunity to plant false information, lead the government to misallocate resources, to steal funds, weapons, equipment, and other resources, and ultimately aid in weakening and delegitimizing the government.Rosenau, Subversion, pg. 6‚Äì7. The targets of infiltration are not limited to the groups and institutions mentioned above. Economic industries and universities have also been the target for infiltration. In the case of universities, the liberal arts departments are more prone to subversion than the hard sciences.Kittell, Allan. \\"Subversion, Progress, and Higher Education.\\" AAUP Bulletin. Vol. 51, No. 4 (September 1965): Pg. 363. =Russian and French methods= Dominique Poirier, former employee and specialist in communication warfare in the French intelligence service, DGSE, describes extensively subversion in a book on the practices and methods of this agency, published in 2019,Poirier, Dominique (Aug. 21, 2019). DGSE : The French Spy Machine. Amazon.com Services LLC, . yet he rarely uses the noun ‚Äúsubversion,‚Äù remarkably. While presenting and describing extensively the Russian and French methods of subversion and counter-subversion, he explains that the French intelligence community in particular uses the term guerre de l‚Äôinformation, or ‚Äúinformation warfare‚Äù. Then information warfare subsumes a number of other nouns, sometimes of Russian origin, each denoting a specific action that may actually describe an action of subversion or counter- subversion. Coming to add to the latter difference in perception of the action of subversion, he further says that information warfare in the French intelligence community is ruled itself by active measures that the DGSE, acting as leading intelligence agency in France, adopted as an ‚Äúall- encompassing‚Äù doctrine. Indeed, active measures in France would regulate not only all intelligence and counterintelligence activities, but also foreign affairs and diplomacy, domestic politics, and even the activities of the major industrial and business companies and groups in this country, since a period he locates between 1980 and 1982. For all the latter would be logically called to partake in a common and coherent effort in intelligence, counterintelligence, influence, and counterinfluence on the French soil as abroad. Actually, the French intelligence community, and the DGSE in particular, always use the nouns ‚Äúinterference‚Äù (ing√©rence, in French) and ‚Äúcounterinterference‚Äù (contre-ing√©rence) to name ‚Äúsubversion‚Äù and ‚Äúcounter- subversion‚Äù respectively. The DGSE and one other intelligence agency of this country at least are particularly active in subversive activities abroad, often in a joint effort with the Russian foreign intelligence service, SVR RF, with a focus on the United States, Dominique Poirier specifies from firsthand knowledge and experience spanning the years 1980 to circa 2001. In the latter context, the main methods of subversion he presents as ‚Äúactions of influence‚Äù and their expected results are the followings. Most French and Russian actions of subversion, and of domestic influence alike, actually are governed by the notion of minority influence as initially defined by social psychologist Serge Moscovici. However, the DGSE in particular designs all such actions in accordance with fundamentals of a scientific approach akin to behaviorism, called ‚Äúbehavioral biology‚Äù (biologie comportementale, in French) initially established in the early 1980s by French military scientist Henri Laborit. Additionally, the narrative, or ‚Äúformal aims‚Äù of the action of subversion ‚Äî when there is one, as behavioral biology focuses on acting on the unconscious, or id, locating in the reptilian brain as defined by Paul D. MacLean ‚Äî is defined in accordance with fundamentals in epistemology, another Russian import in French information warfare and active measures. The expression ‚Äúawareness raising‚Äù ‚Äúwas a Soviet import that occurred in France during the preparatory stage of the riots and general strikes of May 1968. It happened in the early months of the latter year, first as a sophisticated technique in agitprop known in the Soviet KGB under the name —Å–µ–Ω—Å–∏–±–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è (‚Äúsiencibilizatz‚Äôiya‚Äù), otherwise used in the other field of epistemology in Soviet Union. In France, the latter Russian word was given definitively the translation sensibilisation (without equivalent in English) circa March 1968, as this word, sounding similar, already existed with other meanings in this country. The latter facts explain why sensibilisation / awareness raising is the same in its principle as the other method of minority influence in agitprop.‚ÄùPoirier, Dominique (Aug. 21, 2019). DGSE : The French Spy Machine. Amazon.com Services LLC, , p. 47. ‚ÄúAn action of awareness raising in active measures may aim to influence the opinion of the public in one‚Äôs own country or that of a foreign country or both, and its goal is to make masses of people receptive to a concern that may be either true and founded, or false and ill- founded in reality, or neither entirely true and founded nor entirely false and ill-founded but ‚Äúsomewhere between these two absolutes‚Äù. The latter hypothesis, which often is expected in active measures, is explained and ruled by the disciplines of fuzzy logic and chaos theory, and generally aims to breed doubt, confusion, or inhibition, and then angst, discontent, or fear in the minds of people.Poirier, Dominique (Aug. 21, 2019). DGSE : The French Spy Machine. Amazon.com Services LLC, , Chapt. 12. ‚ÄúThe All-encompassing Active Measures‚Äù. Remarkably, French experts in domestic influence and subversion use colloquially the noun ‚Äúsleepwalkers‚Äù (somnanbules, in French) to call ‚Äúall ordinary people composing the masses. The reason justifying the choice of this noun, pejorative in a sense, is that an overwhelming majority of  ªordinary people º is unable to make the difference between neutral and objective information (news) and influence and propaganda. As seen from the viewpoint of specialists, the whole population behaves as millions of sleepwalkers ready to believe anything the media, authors, and agents of influence tell and write, indifferently. The reason explaining the naivet√© is that people tend to believe at its face value everything is formally published and broadcast, by wrongly attributing some official and unanimously approved virtue to media such as print and audiovisual periodical publications, books, and similar. Then the greater the number of people truly or apparently involved in the publishing / broadcasting of a fact or fallacy is, the truer it seems to be in the understanding of the masses. Additionally, the greater the known number of people who watched, listened, or read the fact or fallacy is, the greater the probability is that  ªit is true indeed, º still in the understanding of the masses. ‚Ä¶ Moreover, in France, specialists in influence and counter-influence are tasked to prevent the masses of people / sleepwalkers from ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù and understanding that they actually are thus fooled permanently, and by which methods and tricks they are so, since their own country fabricates and spreads fallacies for them either. In other words, about the latter explanation, teaching the masses on methods and techniques in foreign influence would be effective and salutary, doubtless, but at the same time it would reveal to them the influence and propaganda that their own government tailors and spreads for them. ... In the DGSE, a rule alluding colloquially to this particular definition of sleepwalker says, Ils dorment; ne les r√©veillez pas (‚ÄúThey [the masses] sleep, don‚Äôt wake them up‚Äù). Edgar Morin, French communist philosopher, sociologist, intelligence officer, and founder of modern methods and techniques of mass influence and manipulation is at the origin of this particular use of the word sleepwalker. Morin often said, ‚ÄúEveill√©s, ils dorment‚Äù (‚ÄúAwaken, they sleep‚Äù), quoting his own way Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Thus, Morin implied that, as taken collectively, ordinary people who constitute the masses are too stupid to make the difference between the truth, influence, propaganda, and disinformation. For the record, the exact and complete English translation of Morin's quote above is, ‚ÄúAll men do walk in sleep, and all have faith in that they dream: for all things are as they seem to all, and all things flow like a stream‚ÄùG.T.W. Patrick (Aug. 21, 2019). The Fragments of the work of Heraclitus of Ephesus on Nature. N. Murray pub., Baltimore, 1889.Poirier, Dominique (Aug. 21, 2019). DGSE : The French Spy Machine. Amazon.com Services LLC, , pp. 50-51. =Economics= Economics can be both a tool of the internal and external subversive. For the external subversive simply cutting off credit can cause severe economic problems for a country. An example of this is the United States' relations with Chile in the early 1970s. In an attempt to get Salvador Allende removed from office, the United States tried to weaken the Chilean economy. Chile received little foreign investments and the loss of credit prevented Chile from purchasing vital imports.Qureshi, Lubna. Nixon, Kissinger, and Allende: U.S. Involvement in the 1973 coup in Chile. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009), Pg. 115. An economic pressure of this kind prevents an economy from functioning and reduces a country's standard of living. If the reduction is too great, the people may become willing to support a change in the government's leadership. The main objective of economic pressures is to make it difficult for the country to fulfill its basic obligations to the citizenry either by cutting off trade or by depriving it of resources. The internal subversive can also use economics to put pressure on the government through use of the strike. An example of this is the Chilean Truckers‚Äô Strike during the 1970s. The strike prevented the transport of food staples and forced nearly 50% of the national economy to cease production.Sigmund, Paul. The Overthrow of Allende and the Politics of Chile, 1964‚Äì1976. (Pittsburg: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1977), Pg. 228. Activities of these kinds create human, economic, and political problems that, if not addressed, can challenge the competency of the government. =Agitation and civil unrest= left As defined by Laurence Beilenson, agitation is \\"subversive propaganda by action such as mass demonstrations or the political strike, that is, a strike not intended to benefit the union or workers in the ordinary sense, but intended instead against the government\\".Beilenson, 1972, pg. viii. Furthermore, propaganda and agitation, even when they are legal forms of freedom of speech, press, and assembly can still be classified as subversive activity. These tools further demonstrate the need to determine intent of those taking action to identify subversive activities. Civil unrest creates many of the problems that an insurgency campaign does. First of all it is an affront to government authority, and if the government is unable to quell the unrest it leads to an erosion of state power. This loss of power stems from the people's lack of trust in the government to maintain law and order. In turn, the people begin to question whether or not new leadership is needed. Discrediting, disarming, and demoralizing the government is the goal of these activities and the cause of the government's loss of power.Clutterbuck, Richard, Protest and the Urban Guerrilla, New York: Abelard-Schuman, 1973, Pg. 274. Civil unrest depletes resources as the government is forced to spend more money on additional police. Additionally, civil unrest may be used to provoke a response from the government. In the 1940s communists in France during strikes against the Marshall Plan would, \\"deliberately provoke the police and gendarmerie into acts of repressive violence in order to exploit the resulting 'martyrs to the cause' for propaganda purposes\\".Blackstock, 1964, pg. 84. These martyrs and subsequent propaganda can be useful in turning political and social groups against each other. The less violent forms of unrest, \\"such as worker absenteeism, passive resistance, boycotts, and deliberate attempts to cripple government agencies by 'overloading the system' with false reports, can have powerfully disruptive effects, both economically and politically\\".Rosenau, Subversion, pg. 8. =Offensive terror= Offensive terror can be defined as the killing of people, destruction of property, kidnapping, etc. It is usually a minor part of subversion and, \\"is used not to exert force in the transfer of state power, but is meant to cower the people or ruler\\". Force used in this manner is meant to reinforce other forms or persuasion in addition to cowering the people or leaders.Kitson, 1971, Pg. 4. Additionally, much like civil unrest and agitation, it raises the question of whether or not the state can provide security for the population. Terror also provides a practical motivation of physically removing political opponents. The assassination of an organization's leader may open the door to a successor that is more friendly to the subversives position or possibly someone that has successfully infiltrated the organization and is in fact one of the subversives. =Bribery= Bribery is one of the most common tools of subversion. Most societies see bribery as a form of corruption and it used as a subversive tool because it, \\"implies the undermining of existing rules of political or moral conduct\\".Rhyne, Russell. \\"Patterns of Subversion by Violence.\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. Vol. 341 (May 1962): Pg. 66. It can also be one of the less reliable tools as well. Bribed officials are only useful if they take action. However actions taken over a period of time draw suspicion from the public. The official must be able to carefully conceal their actions or perform only key functions and action. For these reasons bribed officials are most effective when they are asked to take immediate action. In the case of external subversion, bribery is usually used for influence rather than for actions.Beilenson, 1972, pg 77. Subverting cultural hegemony Recent writers, in the post-modern and post-structuralist traditions (including, particularly, feminist writers) have prescribed a very broad form of subversion. It is not, directly, the parliamentary government which should be subverted in their view, but the dominant cultural forces, such as patriarchy, individualism, and scientism. This broadening of the target of subversion owes much to the ideas of Antonio Gramsci, who stressed that communist revolution required the erosion of the particular form of 'cultural hegemony' within society. Theodor Adorno argued that the culture industry and its shallow entertainment was a system by which society was controlled through a top-down creation of standardized culture that intensified the commodification of artistic expression; in 1938 he said that capitalism has colonized every aspect of life so much that \\"every pleasure which emancipates itself from the exchange-value takes on subversive features\\".Adorno (1938) On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening, Zeitschrift f√ºr Sozialforschung (Magazine for Social Research). This essay will be republished in the 1956 collection Dissonanzen. Musik in der verwalteten Welt. Using culture to bring about change to a political system through integration of political warfare and political action and the targeting of cultural vehicles and institutions is another tool of subversion.Lenczowski, John. \\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence and Integrated Strategy\\", in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), Pg 24.Waller, J. Michael, ed. \\"The Public Diplomacy Reader\\" (Institute of World Politics Press, 2007), Pg. 198. The use of the arts or more broadly culture is primarily a tool for external subversives, as internal subversives are generally citizens of the country and share the same culture. It is a tool that takes a longer period of time to implement and its effects are revealed over time, as opposed to those of a terrorist attack or civil unrest. Therefore, one could classify this tool as an element of strategic subversion. The targets of cultural subversive activities are traditionally film, literature, popular music, educational institutions, mass media, religious organizations, charitable organizations and other forms of art. The intended results of these activities are to persuade or co-opt publics, discredit the ideas of enemies and splitting factions within the enemy's camp.Lenczowski. Cultural Diplomacy. Pg 24‚Äì25. The state is charged with the protection of the civilizational values of society (liberty, equality, comradeship, compassion, democracy, education, the family, religion, rule of law, human and civil rights, etc.), \\"including the cultural/aesthetic values that enhance the quality of life and maintain its legitimacy\\".Kapferer, Judith, ed. \\"The State and the Arts: Articulating Power and Subversion.\\" (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008), Pg. 8. In situations where the government is not being a good steward in protecting these values, the use of tools like literature, film, music can be used as a reminder of these values, as well as a forum to protest and question the government's legitimacy. Additionally, art and culture allow people to connect on an emotional level that could soften negative perceptions one may be believed to have. Once the stigma has been removed, the target may be more receptive to other messages conveyed. This individual or group would no longer be seen as being completely different from them. Another example of how culture can be subversive is seen in Iran. Western culture, media, art, etc. is popular among the country's youth, but certain elements are banned or curtailed. As the exportation of Western culture continues, conflict between the state and its citizens is created. The government is then seen as unresponsive or out of touch with its people. Laws =Subversive activity= Subversive activity is the lending of aid, comfort, and moral support to individuals, groups, or organizations that advocate the overthrow of incumbent governments by force and violence. All willful acts that are intended to be detrimental to the best interests of the government and that do not fall into the categories of treason, sedition, sabotage, or espionage are placed in the category of subversive activity. =Mainland China= Subversion () is a crime in Mainland China. The Government of the People's Republic of China prosecutes subversives under Articles 102 through 112 of the state criminal law. These articles specify the types of behavior that constitute a threat to national security and China has prosecuted many dissidents including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo using these laws. Of these, Articles 105 and 111 are the ones most commonly employed to silence political dissent. Article 105 criminalizes organizing, plotting, or carrying out subversion of the national order, or using rumor mongering or defamation or other means to incite subversion of the national order or the overthrow of the socialist system. Article 111 prohibits stealing, secretly collecting, purchasing, or illegally providing state secrets or intelligence to an organization, institution, or personnel outside the country.Coliver, 1999, p. 245. =Hong Kong= Subversion was criminalised in Hong Kong on 30 June 2020 by the controversial Hong Kong national security law. =Italy= Subversion is a crime in Italy (Attentato alla Costituzione), under Article 283 of Italian criminal law (Codice penale italiano) and Associazione sovversiva, under Articles 270 and 270-bis. =United Kingdom= There is no crime defined as \\"subversion\\" (as opposed to treason) in British constitutional law. Attempts have been made to introduce definitions but there is no general consensus among political and legal theorists.Gill, Peter (1994). Policing politics: security intelligence and the liberal democratic state. Routledge. p. 119. Historically MI5 were entrusted with the legal investigative powers for concerns of threats to national security by subversion, but in the Security Service Act 1989, subversion was not mentioned, and according to the official MI5 website, subversion is no longer investigated, due to a reduced threat as a result of the end of the Cold War and of associated political situations since the 1980s.Military Intelligence 5 of the United Kingdom ‚Äì Subversion published by The Crown [Retrieved 2015-07-26] =United States= The founders of the United States wanted to avoid charges of subversion. As such they justified their resistance to the British government through the use of the private citizen argument and the doctrine of the lesser magistrate in the United States Declaration of Independence.Kelly OConnell of Canada Free Press, August 4, 2014, parts II. Magdeburg Confession and III. Doctrine of Lesser Magistrates covers \\"Treason, Sedition, and Subversive Activities\\" in Federal law. As related above, members of the Communist Party were supposed by legislators to be subversives, especially after the Russian Revolution. The House Un-American Activities Committee was formed in 1938 in order to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having Communist ties. Senator Joseph McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread Communist subversion. The term \\"McCarthyism\\", coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, including public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents, was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities. Senator Pat McCarran sponsored the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, both of which were hotly contested in the law courts, and by Harry Truman, who went so far as to veto the former; however, the veto was overridden in the Senate by a margin of 57 to 10. In 1943, the Stone court ruled in a bitterly contested fashion that an avowed publisher of the Communist doctrine could be naturalized a citizen of the US, in Schneiderman v. United States, . Aptheker v. Secretary of State tested in 1964 whether a passport could be disallowed to a Communist. Aptheker won. Elfbrandt v. Russell involved questions concerning the constitutionality of an Arizona Act requiring an oath from state employees. William O. Douglas wrote in 1966 for a strongly divided court the majority opinion that the State could not require the oath and accompanying statutory gloss. The Warren court ruled by 5‚Äì4 majority in Keyishian v. Board of Regents (of SUNY) to strike down New York State law that prohibited membership by professors in any organization that advocated the overthrow of the US government, or any organization that was held by the Regents to be \\"treasonous\\" or \\"seditious\\". The Regents also required teachers and employees to sign an oath that they were not members of the Communist Party. = Iran = Subversion (Persian: ÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸÜÿØÿßÿ≤€å ; Romanization : barandƒÅzi) is a crime in Iran.The government of Islamic Republic of Iran prosecutes subversives under Articles 498 through 500, 507 and 508 of Iran's criminal laws.

Terminology and background A casket with the \\"Promoted to Glory\\" flag draped over the top Earliest printed usage of the term seems to be in late 1882 in The War Cry, which included death announcements in the December 14 issue, with headlines such as 'Promotion of Sister Muxlow from Earth to Heaven' and 'Private Rudd goes to Glory from the Open-air.' Another report, headed 'Promotion from Cheltenham to Glory,' appeared in The War Cry of December 16, 1882. Some Salvation Army corps have a Promoted to Glory Board or ledger on which all members (Soldiers or Adherents) of that corps, who have died, are listed along with the year of their death. The Salvation Army flag may be draped over the coffin. The term Promoted to Glory was actually coined by Herbert Booth, son of the Founder William Booth, following the death of Catherine Booth, the Mother of the Salvation Army. He wrote the song \\"Promoted to Glory\\" which is still used at funerals today. Words & Music: Herbert H. Booth, in Songs of Peace and War, 1890 (MIDI, score). Booth wrote this song while preparing for his mother's funeral. Song \\\\---- Summoned home, the call has sounded, Bidding a soldier his warfare cease; And the song of angels resounded, Welcomes a warrior to eternal peace.

Coons is a former math teacher, having worked in the Prince Rupert area for 25 years. He was a teacher at Charles Hays Secondary School. He was also more recently the president of the Prince Rupert District Teachers Union, a local of the British Columbia Teachers' Federation. Education Coons was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Soon after he was born his family moved to Lachine, Quebec, which was, at that time, a city outside of Montreal. In 1967, he moved to Burlington, Ontario where he began his lifelong love affair with hockey, playing junior \\"B\\" with the Burlington Mohawks. He graduated from Nelson High School which he attended from grades 11 to 13. After graduating, Coons attended the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario where he received his BA in Mathematics and his Bachelor of Education, with specializations in Math and Physical Education. Throughout his school years, Coons continued playing hockey, playing junior \\"A\\" hockey with the St.Thomas Elgins from 1970-71 before moving up to the Mustangs university team. While playing on University of Western Ontario hockey team, Coons claimed a university league record for penalty minutes. Career In 1976, after completing his education, Coons moved to Prince George where he worked for a juvenile detention center with kids in need. Coons left Prince George when he was hired as a special education teacher at Prince Rupert's Booth Memorial Junior Secondary school in 1977. He worked as a teacher for three years before he resigned, in 1980, to co-ordinate the 1981 Northern BC Winter Games, which were held in Prince Rupert. Once the games were completed, Coons tried his hand in the commercial fishing industry, working on a gill-netter for a short time. In 1981, Coons married Lois Elliot, another teacher in Prince Rupert. She currently teaches at Pineridge school. Together, they have two children, Hannah and Breton. In 1982, Coons returned to teaching at Booth Memorial Junior Secondary, this time as a math teacher. In 1986, Coons became the head instructor at Kaien Alternate school, this continued until 1992, when he went on a teaching exchange to Australia. After his exchange to Australia, Coons was back in Prince Rupert, teaching, this time at Charles Hays Secondary School. He taught the subjects of math and physical education. His love of sports led Coons to coach recreational activities on a community level, including baseball, soccer and hockey. Throughout this time, Coons was active in the British Columbia Teachers' Federation. His commitment to social justice and activism led him to sit on committees and to participate in many roles in the BCTF from 1983‚Äì2005. His first experience with a major political movement was in 1983, when the Solidarity Coalition rallied against twenty-seven Bills the provincial legislature had introduced. Coons joined more than 50,000 unionists and other demonstrators in protesting the Bills, which attacked human rights, labour, education, and social programs in British Columbia. Coons served as president of the Prince Rupert District Teachers' Union from 2001‚Äì2004. During his time as president of the union, Coons participated in political actions; this led him to put his name forward as a nominee for the NDP for the 2005 election. He won the nomination, and, eventually, the seat.

Traditionally Soun held a reputation of a r≈çnin who rose to power almost overnight in Kant≈ç; however, he belonged to a prestigious family in the direct employment of the Ashikaga sh≈çgun, and enjoyed important family connections. His sister was married to Imagawa Yoshitada, a major daimy≈ç from a prestigious cadet branch of the Ashikaga family. Shinkuro became a retainer in the Imagawa clan, and when Yoshitada died in battle in 1476, Shinkur≈ç mediated the succession dispute between supporters of Yoshitada's son Imagawa Ujichika and Yoshitada's cousin, Oshika Norimitsu. This proved a temporary peace. When Norimitsu again attempted to gain control of the Imagawa clan, S≈çun came to Ujichika's defense, killing Norimitsu. S≈çun was rewarded by Ujichika with Kokukuji castle. He gained control of Izu Province in 1493, avenging a wrong committed by a member of the Ashikaga family which held the shogunate. With S≈çun's successful invasion in Izu province, he is credited by most historians as being the first \\"Sengoku daimy≈ç\\". About 1475, under the cognomen of Ise Shinkuro, he worked for Imagawa, the constable of Suruga Province, and eventually became an \\"independent leader\\" with a number of warriors joining him. In 1491, he was able to take Horigoye after the death of Kant≈ç kub≈ç Ashikaga Masatomo, gaining control of Izu Province. He then adopted the surname of H≈çj≈ç and the given name of S≈çun or Sozui. After building a stronghold at Nirayama, H≈çj≈ç S≈çun secured Odawara Castle in 1494, the castle which would become the center of the H≈çj≈ç family's domains for nearly a century. In an act of treachery, he seized the castle after arranging for its lord to be murdered while out hunting. In 1516, he laid siege to the castle of Arai, and \\"was virtual master of all Sagami\\". In 1519, S≈çun died in Nirayama Castle and passed on the newly built H≈çj≈ç domains to his son Ujitsuna, who subsequently changed the clan name from the original Ise to H≈çj≈ç and posthumously renamed his father to H≈çj≈ç S≈çun. In 1521, Ujitsuna built S≈çun-ji temple dedicated to his father.

John Smith, one of the first histories of Virginia. The History of Virginia begins with documentation by the first Spanish explorers to reach the area in the 1500s, when it was occupied chiefly by Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan peoples. After a failed English attempt to colonize Virginia in the 1580s by Walter Raleigh, permanent English colonization began in Virginia with Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. The Virginia Company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves. The famine during the harsh winter of 1609 forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism. The colony nearly failed until tobacco emerged as a profitable export. It was grown on plantations, using primarily indentured servants for the intensive hand labor involved. After 1662, the colony turned black slavery into a hereditary racial caste. By 1750, the primary cultivators of the cash crop were West African slaves. While the plantations thrived because of the high demand for tobacco, most white settlers raised their families on subsistence farms. Warfare with the Virginia Indian nations had been a factor in the 17th century; after 1700 there was continued conflict with natives east of the Alleghenies, especially in the French and Indian War (1754-1763), when the tribes were allied with the French.Charles H. Ambler and Festus P. Summers, West Virginia, the mountain state (1958) pp 48-52, 55 The westernmost counties including Wise and Washington only became safe with the death of Bob Benge in 1794. The Virginia Colony became the wealthiest and most populated British colony in North America, with an elected General Assembly. The colony was dominated by rich planters who were also in control of the established Anglican Church. Baptist and Methodist preachers brought the Great Awakening, welcoming black members and leading to many evangelical and racially integrated churches. Virginia planters had a major role in gaining independence and in the development of democratic-republican ideals of the United States. They were important in the Declaration of Independence, writing the Constitutional Convention (and preserving protection for the slave trade), and establishing the Bill of Rights. The state of Kentucky separated from Virginia in 1792. Four of the first five presidents were Virginians: George Washington, the \\"Father of his country\\"; and after 1800, \\"The Virginia Dynasty\\" of presidents for 24 years: Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. During the first half of the 19th century, tobacco prices declined and tobacco lands lost much of their fertility. Planters adopted mixed farming, with an emphasis on wheat and livestock, which required less labor. The Constitutions of 1830 and 1850 expanded suffrage but did not equalize white male apportionment statewide. The population grew slowly from 700,000 in 1790, to 1 million in 1830, to 1.2 million in 1860. Virginia was the largest state joining the Confederate States of America in 1861. It became the major theater of war in the American Civil War. Unionists in western Virginia created the separate state of West Virginia. Virginia's economy was devastated in the war and disrupted in Reconstruction, when it was administered as Military District Number One. The first signs of recovery were seen in tobacco cultivation and the related cigarette industry, followed by coal mining and increasing industrialization. In 1883, conservative white Democrats regained power in the state government, ending Reconstruction and implementing Jim Crow laws. The 1902 Constitution limited the number of white voters below 19th-century levels and effectively disfranchised blacks until federal civil rights legislation of the mid-1960s. From the 1920s to the 1960s, the state was dominated by the Byrd Organization, with dominance by rural counties aligned in a Democratic party machine, but their hold was broken over their failed Massive Resistance to school integration. After World War II, the state's economy thrived, with a new industrial and urban base. A statewide community college system was developed. The first U.S. African-American governor since Reconstruction was Virginia's Douglas Wilder in 1990. Since the late 20th century, the contemporary economy has become more diversified in high-tech industries and defense-related businesses. Virginia's changing demography makes for closely divided voting in national elections but it is still generally conservative in state politics. Prehistory For thousands of years before the arrival of the English, various societies of indigenous peoples inhabited the portion of the New World later designated by the English as \\"Virginia\\". Archaeological and historical research by anthropologist Helen C. Rountree and others has established 3,000 years of settlement in much of the Tidewater. Even so, a historical marker dedicated in 2015 states that recent archaeological work at Pocahontas Island has revealed prehistoric habitation dating to about 6500 BCE.\\"Archaeological evidence also indicates that Native Americans occupied the area as early as 6500 BC.\\" \\"State Historical Highway Marker 'Pocahontas Island' To Be Dedicated in Petersburg\\", Petersburg, VA Official Website, Posted on: June 16, 2015, archived article accessed February 25, 2016 region's savanna. =Native Americans= As of the 16th Century, what is now the state of Virginia was occupied by three main culture groups: the Iroquoian, the Eastern Siouan and the Algonquian. The tip of the Delmarva Peninsula south of the Indian River was controlled by the Algonquian Nanticoke. Meanwhile, the Tidewater region along the Chesapeake Bay coastline appears to have been controlled by the Algonquian Piscataway (who lived around the Potomac River), the Powhatan and Chowanoke, or Roanoke (who lived between the James River and Neuse River.). Inland of them were two Iroquoian tribes known as the Nottoway, or Managog, and the Meherrin. The rest of Virginia was almost entirely Eastern Sioux, divided between the Monaghan and the Manahoac, who held lands from central West Virginia, through southern Virginia and up to the Maryland border (the region of the Shenandoah River Valley was controlled by a different people). Also, the lands peoples connected to the Mississippian Culture may have just barely crossed over into the state into its southwestern corner. Later, these tribes merged to form the Yuchi.Virginia Indian Tribes, University of Richmond Clarence Walworth Alvord and Lee Bidgood, 1912. * Algonquian Rountree has noted that \\"empire\\" more accurately describes the political structure of the Powhatan. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a chief named Wahunsunacock created this powerful empire by conquering or affiliating with approximately thirty tribes whose territories covered much of what is now eastern Virginia. Known as the Powhatan, or paramount chief, he called this area Tenakomakah (\\"densely inhabited Land\\"). c.f. Anishinaabe language: danakamigaa: \\"activity-grounds\\", i.e. \\"land of much events [for the People\\" The empire was advantageous to some tribes, who were periodically threatened by other groups, such as the Monacan. The first English colony, Jamestown, was allegedly allowed to be settled by Chief Powhatan as he wanted new military and economic advantages over the Siouans west of his people. The following chief, Opechancanough, succeeded him within only a couple of years after contact and had a much different view of the English. He led several failed uprisings, which caused his people to fracture, some tribes going south to live among the Chowanoke or north to live among the Piscataway. After that, one of his sons took several Powhatans and moved off to the northwest, becoming the Shawnee and took over former Susquehannock territories.Edward Bland, The Discoverie of New Brittaine Recorded in the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania throughout the 17th century, they eventually made their way into the Ohio River Valley, where they are believed to have merged with a variety of other native peoples to form the powerful confederacy that controlled the area that is now West Virginia until the Shawnee Wars (1811-1813).\\"The Shawnee Tribe and War of 1812\\". SchoolworkHelper.net. Retrieved August 17, 2017. By only 1646, very few Powhatans remained and were policed harshly by the English, no longer even allowed to choose their own leaders. They were organized into the Pamunkey and Mattaponi tribes.Wood, Karenne (editor). The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, 2007. They eventually dissolved altogether and merged into Colonial society. The Piscataway were pushed north on the Potomac River early in their history, coming to be cut off from the rest of their people. While some stayed, others chose to migrate west. Their movements are generally unrecorded in the historical record, but they reappear at Fort Detroit in modern-day Michigan by the end of the 18th century. These Piscataways are said to have moved to Canada and probably merged with the Mississaugas, who had broken away from the Anishinaabeg and migrated southeast into that same region. Despite that, many Piscataway stayed in Virginia and Maryland until the modern day. Other members of the Piscataway also merged with the Nanticoke. The Nanticoke seem to have been largely confined to Indian Towns, but were later relocated to New York in 1778. Afterward, they dissolved, with groups joining the Iroquois and Lenape.Pritzker 441 The Chowanoke were moved to reservation lands by the English in 1677, where they remained until the 19th century. By 1821, they had merged with other tribes and were generally dissolved, however the descendants of these peoples reformed in the 21st century and re-acquired much of their old reservation in 2014. * Eastern Siouan Many of the Siouan peoples of the state seem to have originally been a collection of smaller tribes with uncertain affiliation. Names recorded throughout the 17th century were the Monahassanough, Rassawek, Mowhemencho, Monassukapanough, Massinacack, Akenatsi, Mahoc, Nuntaneuck, Nutaly, Nahyssan, Sapon, Monakin, Toteros, Keyauwees, Shakori, Eno, Sissipahaw, Monetons and Mohetons living and migrating throughout what is now West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.Hodge, F. W. (1910). The Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office.Mooney, James, The Siouan Tribes of the Southeast. Smithsonian Institution. Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1894.Brashler 1987Kent 2001 All were said to have spoken, at least two distinct languages‚ÄîSaponi (which appears to be a missing link language existing between the Chiwere and Dhegihan variants) and Catawba (which is most closely related to Biloxi and the Gulf Coast Siouan languages).Hale, Horatio \\"Tutelo Tribe & Language\\" (1883)Owen-Dorsey, James & Swanton, John R. \\"A Dictionary of Biloxi & Ofo\\" (1912)Speck, Frank G. \\"Catawba Texts\\" (1969) John Smith was the first to note two groups in the Virginian interior‚Äîthe Monaghans and the Monahoacs. The words came from the PowhatanCollins, Scott Preston \\"Saponi History\\" and translations are uncertain, however Monaghan seems similar to a known Lenape word, Monaquen, which means \\"to scalp.\\"http://www.gilwell.com/lenape/lenape.pdf They were also commonly referred to as the Eastern Blackfoot, which explains why some Saponi today identify as the Siouan-Blackfoot people, and later still as the Christannas. As far as can be assumed, however, it seems that they were arranged thus‚Äîfrom east to west along the north shore of the James River, just inland of the Powhatan, would have been the Eno, Shakori and Saponi. Around the source of the river (and probably holding some of the river's islands a ways back east) should have been the Occaneechi, or Akenatsi. They were believed to have been the \\"grandfather\\" tribe of the region, a term among native peoples for any tribe highly respected and venerated for being the first or oldest people of their kind. West of the Occaneechi and primarily located in what is now West Virginia were, at least, two more tribes believed to have been related‚Äîthe Moneton of the Kanawha River and the Tutelo of the Bluestone River, which separates West Virginia from Kentucky. About midway along the southern shores of the James River should have been the Sissipahaw. They were probably the only Eastern Siouan tribe in the state who would have spoken a form of Catawba language, rather than Saponi/ Tutelo. North of them were the Manahoac, or Mahock. The Keyauwee are also of note. It is difficult to say whether they were a subtribe of others mentioned, a newly formed tribe, or from somewhere else. Originally existing along the entirety of the current western border of Virginia and up through some of the southwestern mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky, they seem to have first been driven east by the Iroquoian Westo during the Beaver Wars.Jerald T. Milanich (February 10, 2006). Laboring in the Fields of the Lord: Spanish Missions And Southeastern Indians. University Press of Florida. p. 169. . Retrieved June 25, 2012.\\"Discoveries of John Lederer,\\" reprinted by O.H. Harpel, Cincinnati (1879) Historians have since come to note that the Westo were almost definitely the Erie and Neutrals/ Chonnonton, who had conquered wide swathes of what is now northern and eastern Ohio approximately during the 1630s and were subsequently conquered and driven out by the Iroquois Confederacy around 1650. The Tutelo of West Virginia first seem to be noted as living north of the Saponi, in northern Virginia in around 1670.Batt's \\"Journal & Relation of a New Discovery\\" N.Y. Hist. Col. Vol. III, p. 191 (1671) Later in the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois lost their new lands in Ohio and Michigan to the French and their new native allies around the western Great Lakes. Sometime during the 1680s-90s,\\"Lambreville to Bruyas Nov. 4,1696\\" N.Y. Hist. Col. Vol. III, p. 484 the Iroquois started pushing south and declared war on the Saponi related tribes, pushing them down into North Carolina. It is noted in 1701 that the Saponi, Tutelo, Occaneechi, Shakori and Keyauwee were then going to form a confederacy to take back their homeland. The writer assumes that all five tribes were driven south, but the Tutelos are noted as allies from the \\"western mountains.\\"Lawson's \\"History of Carolina\\" reprinted by Stroller & Marcom. Raleigh, 1860, p. 384 This is the same year that the Iroquois surrendered to the French, but it appears that hostilities with the Saponi continued long term. The Iroquois were soon after convinced by the English to start selling off all their extended lands, which were nearly impossible for them to hold. All they kept was a string of territory along the Susquahanna River in Pennsylvania. The Saponi attempted to return to their lands, but were unable to do so. Around 1702, the Governor of the Virginia Colony gave them reservation land and opened Fort Christanna nearby. All the tribes appear to have returned, except the Keyauwee, who remained among the Catawba. They came to be known as the Christanna People at this time. This fort offered economic and educational aid to the locals, but after the fort closed in 1718, the Saponi dispersed. With continued conflicts between the Saponi and Iroquios in the region, the governors of Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York joined to organize a peace treaty, which did ultimately end the conflict. Some time around 1722, the Tutelo and some other Saponis migrated to the Iroquoian-held Pennsylvania territory and settled there, among many other refugees of local tribes who had been destroyed, absorbed into Colonial society, or simply moved on without them.N.Y. Hist. Col. Vol. V, p. 633\\"Life of Brainerd\\" p. 167 In 1753, the Iroquois reorganized them all into Tutelo, Delaware and Nanticoke Tribes, relocated them to New York and gave them full honors among the Confederacy, despite none of them being Iroquoian.N.Y. Hist. Col. Vol. VI, p. 811 After the American Revolution, these tribes accompanied them to Canada. Later, the descendants of the Tutelos migrated again to Ohio, becoming the Saponi and Tutelo Tribes of Ohio. Many of the other Siouan peoples of Virginia were also noted to have merged with the Catawba and Yamasee tribes.Mooney, J. (1894). The Siouan Tribes of the East. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. * Iroquoian While mainly noted in Virginia, it appears that the Tuscarora migrated into the region from the Delmarva Peninsula early in the 17th century. John Smith noted them on an early map as the Kuskarawocks.http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/maps/captain- smith-virginia-map.jpg (They may have also absorbed the Tockwoghs, who also appear on the map and were most likely Iroquoian.) After an extended war with the English, the Tuscarora began leaving for New York and began merging with the Iroquois in groups around 1720, continuing approximately until the Iroquois were banished to Canada following the American Revolution. Those who remained became a new tribe‚Äîthe Coharie‚Äîand migrated south to live near the Meherrin.\\"Coharie Tribe\\". Coharie Tribe. Coharie Tribe. Retrieved 27 January 2017. The Meherrin aided the Tuscarora in that war, but did not follow them north. In 1717, the English gave them a reservation just south of the North Carolina border. The North Carolina government contested their land rights and tried to take them away due to a surveyor's error that caused both Native and English settlers to claim parts of the reservation. However, they managed to, more or less, stay put well into the modern day. The Nottoway also managed to largely stay in the vicinity of Virginia until the modern day without much conflict or loss of heritage. Although the Beaver Wars were primarily centered in Ohio, the Iroquois Confederacy of New York were also in a long strung conflict with the Susquehannocks of central Pennsylvania, as was the English colony of Maryland, although the two were not known to be allies themselves. Sometime around the 1650s or 1660s, Maryland made peace with and allied themselves to the Susquehannocks, thus the Iroquois labelled them an enemy as well, despite being allied with England by this time. After ending their war with the Susquehannocks in 1674, however, the Iroquois went on a more or less inexplicable rampage against Maryland and its remaining Native allies, which included the Piscataways and the Eastern Siouans tribes. The Eastern Siouans were forced out of the state during the 1680s. After the Beaver Wars officially ended in 1701, the Iroquois sold off their extended holdings‚Äîincluding their land in Virginia‚Äîto the English. In the mid 17th century, around 1655-6, an Iroquoian group known as the Westo invaded Virginia. While many theories abound as to their origins, they appear to have been the last of the Eries and Chonnontons who invaded Ohio at the start of the Beaver Wars.\\"EARLY INDIAN MIGRATION IN OHIO\\". GenealogyTrails.com. Retrieved August 17, 2017. The Westo seem to have pushed into southern West Virginia, then moved straight south to move on the smaller Siouan tribes of the Carolinas. In the 1680s, they were destroyed by a coalition of native warriors led by a tribe called the Sawanno.Cheves, L. \\"Shaftesbury Papers.\\" Col. of the South Carolina Historical Society 5, Richmond: William Ellis Jones There is also a note from the Cherokee that a group of \\"Shawnee\\" were living among them in the 1660s (following the Westo invasion, but prior to their defeat), then migrated into southern West Virginia. * Other Tribes of Note The first Spanish and English explorers appear to have greatly overestimated the size of the Cherokee, placing them as far north as Virginia. However, many historians now believe that there was a large, mixed race/ mixed language confederacy in the region, called the Coosa. The Spanish also gave them the nicknames Chalaques and Uchis during the 16th century and the English turned Chalaques into Cherokees.Cheves, L. \\"Shaftesbury Papers.\\" Col. of the South Carolina Historical Society 5, Richmond: William Ellis Jones The Cherokees we know today were among these people, but lived much further south and both the Cherokee language (of Iroquoian origin) and the Yuchi language (Muskogean) have been heavily modified by Siouan influence and carry many Siouan borrow words.\\"Yuchi Language Primer\\" (2007) Yuchi.orgcherokeelessons.com/pdf/Cherokee Lessons 978-0-557-68640-7.pdf This nation would have existed throughout parts of the states of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North and South Carolina and Georgia, with cores of different culture groups organized at different extremes of the territory and, probably, speaking Yuchi as a common tongue. After the Westo punched straight through them, they seem to have split along the line of the Tennessee River to create the Cherokee to the south and the Yuchi to the north.Oatis, Steven J. \\"A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, (1680-1730) Then, following the Yamasee War (1715‚Äì1717), the Yuchi were force across AppalachiaOatis, A Colonial Complex and split again, into the Coyaha and the Chisca. The French, seeing an opportunity for new allies, ingratiated themselves with the Chisca and had them relocated to the heart of the Illinois Colony to live among the Algonquian Ilinoweg. Later, as French influence along the Ohio River waned, the tribe seems to have split away again, taking many Ilinoweg tribes with them, and moved back to Kentucky, where they became the Kispoko. The Kispoko later became the fourth tribe of Shawnee.Charles Augustus Hanna, 1911 The Wilderness Trail, Vol II, 1911, pp. 93‚Äì95. Meanwhile, the Coyaha reforged their alliance with the Cherokee and brought in many of the smaller Muskogean tribes of Alabama (often referred to as the Mobilians) to form the Creek Confederacy. While this tribe would go on to have great historical influence to the remaining Colonial Era and the early history of the United States, they never returned to Virginia.Ethridge, Robbie (2003). \\"Chapter 5: \\"The People of Creek Country\\"\\". Creek Country: The Creek Indians and their World. The University of North Carolina Press. p. 93. . Furthermore, alike the Sawannos, it seems many splinter groups fractured off from the core group and moved into places like West Virginia and Kentucky. Afterwards, those lands seemed to be filled with native peoples who claimed \\"Cherokee\\" ancestry, yet had no organized tribal affiliation. The descendants of those people live throughout West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Ohio today. However, it also seems probable that these populations married into the surviving Monongahela and other Siouan groups, yet the populations must have been quite small on both sides to allow that these peoples never reformed a government and remained nomadic for a great deal of time afterwards. Early European exploration After their discovery of the New World in the 15th century, European states began trying to establish New World colonies. England, the Dutch Republic, France, Portugal, and Spain were the most active. Map of Virginia published by John Smith (1612) =Spanish= In 1540, a party led by two Spaniards, Juan de Villalobos and Francisco de Silvera, sent by Hernando de Soto, entered what is now Lee County in search of gold. In the spring of 1567, Hernando Moyano de Morales, a sergeant of Spanish explorer Juan Pardo, led a group of soldiers northward from Fort San Juan in Joara, a native town in what is now western North Carolina, to attack and destroy the Chisca village of Maniatique near present-day Saltville. The attack near Saltville was the first recorded battle in Virginia history. Another Spanish party, captained by Antonio Vel√°zquez in the caravel Santa Catalina, explored to the lower Chesapeake Bay region of Virginia in mid-1561 under the orders of √Ångel de Villafa√±e. During this voyage, two Kiskiack or Paspahegh youths, including Don Luis were taken back to Spain. In 1566, an expedition sent from Spanish Florida by Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s reached the Delmarva Peninsula. The expedition consisted of two Dominican friars, thirty soldiers and Don Luis, in a failed effort to set up a Spanish colony in the Chesapeake, believing it to be an opening to the fabled Northwest Passage. In 1570, Spanish Jesuits established the Ajac√°n Mission on the lower peninsula. However, in 1571 it was destroyed by Don Luis and a party of his indigenous allies.Price, 11 In August 1572, Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s arrived from St. Augustine with thirty soldiers and sailors to take revenge for the massacre of the Jesuits, and hanged approximately 20 natives. In 1573, the governor of Spanish Florida, Pedro Men√©ndez de M√°rquez, conducted further exploration of the Chesapeake. In the 1580s, captain Vicente Gonz√°lez led several voyages into the Chesapeake in search of English settlements in the area. In 1609, Spanish Florida governor Pedro de Ibarra sent Francisco Fern√°ndez de √âcija from St. Augustine to survey the activities of the Jamestown colonists, yet Spain never attempted a colony after the failure of the Ajac√°n Mission. =English= The Roanoke Colony was the first English colony in the New World. It was founded at Roanoke Island in what was then Virginia, now part of Dare County, North Carolina. Between 1584 and 1587, there were two major groups of settlers sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh who attempted to establish a permanent settlement at Roanoke Island, and each failed. The final group disappeared completely after supplies from England were delayed three years by a war with Spain. Because they disappeared, they were called \\"The Lost Colony.\\" The name Virginia came from information gathered by the Raleigh-sponsored English explorations along what is now the North Carolina coast. Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe reported that a regional \\"king\\" named Wingina ruled a land of Wingandacoa. Queen Elizabeth modified the name to \\"Virginia\\", perhaps in part noting her status as the \\"Virgin Queen.\\" Although the word is latinate, it stands as the oldest English language place-name in the United States.Three names from the Roanoke Colony are still in use, all based on Native American names. On the second voyage, Raleigh learned that, while the chief of the Secotans was indeed called Wingina, the expression wingandacoa, heard by the English upon arrival, actually meant \\"You wear good clothes\\" in Carolina Algonquian, and was not the native name of the country, as previously misunderstood.Raleigh, History of the World: \\"For when some of my people asked the name of that country, one of the savages answered 'Win-gan-da-coa', which is as much as to say, 'You wear good clothes.' =Virginia Company of London= Seal of the Virginia Company of London After the death of Queen Elizabeth I, in 1603 King James I assumed the throne of England. After years of war, England was strapped for funds, so he granted responsibility for England's New World colonization to the Virginia Company, which became incorporated as a joint stock company by a proprietary charter drawn up in 1606. There were two competing branches of the Virginia Company and each hoped to establish a colony in Virginia in order to exploit gold (which the region did not actually have), to establish a base of support for English privateering against Spanish ships, and to spread Protestantism to the New World in competition with Spain's spread of Catholicism. Within the Virginia Company, the Plymouth Company branch was assigned a northern portion of the area known as Virginia, and the London Company area to the south. =Jamestown= Reenactment of the first landing (Captain Smith, foreground) First landing In December 1606, the London Company dispatched a group of 104 colonists in three ships: the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery, under the command of Captain Christopher Newport. After a long, rough voyage of 144 days, the colonists finally arrived in Virginia on April 26, 1607 at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. At Cape Henry, they went ashore, erected a cross, and did a small amount of exploring, an event which came to be called the \\"First Landing.\\" Under orders from London to seek a more inland location safe from Spanish raids, they explored the Hampton Roads area and sailed up the newly christened James River to the Fall Line at what would later become the cities of Richmond and Manchester. Settlement After weeks of exploration, the colonists selected a location and founded Jamestown on May 14, 1607. It was named in honor of King James I (as was the river). However, while the location at Jamestown Island was favorable for defense against foreign ships, the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement. It lacked drinking water, access to game for hunting, or much space for farming. While it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the Native Americans, within a short time, the colonists were attacked by members of the local Paspahegh tribe. Sketch of Jamestown c.1608 The colonists arrived ill-prepared to become self-sufficient. They had planned on trading with the Native Americans for food, were dependent upon periodic supplies from England, and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold. Leaving the Discovery behind for their use, Captain Newport returned to England with the Susan Constant and the Godspeed, and came back twice during 1608 with the First Supply and Second Supply missions. Trading and relations with the Native Americans was tenuous at best, and many of the colonists died from disease, starvation, and conflicts with the natives. After several failed leaders, Captain John Smith took charge of the settlement, and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years, as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists. After Smith's return to England in August 1609, there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies. During the winter of 1609/10 and continuing into the spring and early summer, no more ships arrived. The colonists faced what became known as the \\"starving time\\". When the new governor Sir Thomas Gates, finally arrived at Jamestown on May 23, 1610, along with other survivors of the wreck of the Sea Venture that resulted in Bermuda being added to the territory of Virginia, he discovered over 80% of the 500 colonists had died; many of the survivors were sick. Back in England, the Virginia Company was reorganized under its Second Charter, ratified on May 23, 1609, which gave most leadership authority of the colony to the governor, the newly appointed Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. In June 1610, he arrived with 150 men and ample supplies. De La Warr began the First Anglo-Powhatan War, against the natives. Under his leadership, Samuel Argall kidnapped Pocahontas, daughter of the Powhatan chief, and held her at Henricus. The economy of the Colony was another problem. Gold had never been found, and efforts to introduce profitable industries in the colony had all failed until John Rolfe introduced his two foreign types of tobacco: Orinoco and Sweet Scented. These produced a better crop than the local variety and with the first shipment to England in 1612, the customers enjoyed the flavor, thus making tobacco a cash crop that established Virginia's economic viability. The First Anglo-Powhatan War ended when Rolfe married Pocahontas in 1614. Plantation beginnings Map depicting the Colony of Virginia. Made between 1609 and 1638 by Willem Blaeu. George Yeardley took over as Governor of Virginia in 1619. He ended one-man rule and created a representative system of government with the General Assembly, the first elected legislative assembly in the New World. Also in 1619, the Virginia Company sent 90 single women as potential wives for the male colonists to help populate the settlement. That same year the colony acquired a group of \\"twenty and odd\\" Angolans, brought by two English privateers. They were probably the first Africans in the colony. They, along with many European indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colony's primary product. Although these black men were treated as indentured servants, this marked the beginning of America's history of slavery. Major importation of enslaved Africans by European slave traders did not take place until much later in the century. In some areas, individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established, providing families with motivation to increase production, improve standards of living, and gain wealth. Perhaps nowhere was this more progressive than at Sir Thomas Dale's ill-fated Henricus, a westerly-lying development located along the south bank of the James River, where natives were also to be provided an education at the Colony's first college. About south of the falls at present-day Richmond, in Henrico Cittie, the Falling Creek Ironworks was established near the confluence of Falling Creek, using local ore deposits to make iron. It was the first in North America. Virginians were intensely individualistic at this point, weakening the small new communities. According to Breen (1979) their horizon was limited by the present or near future. They believed that the environment could and should be forced to yield quick financial returns. Thus everyone was looking out for number one at the expense of the cooperative ventures. Farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed. This extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the Indians, resulting in two massacres.T. H. Breen, \\"Looking Out for Number One: Conflicting Cultural Values in Early Seventeenth- Century Virginia,\\" South Atlantic Quarterly, Summer 1979, Vol. 78 Issue 3, pp. 342‚Äì360 Conflict with natives A European artist's depiction of the Indian Massacre of 1622 English settlers soon came into conflict with the natives. Despite some successful interaction, issues of ownership and control of land and other resources, and trust between the peoples, became areas of conflict. Virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years. The colonists did not understand that the natives were ill-prepared to feed them during hard times. In the years after 1612, the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco, their crucial cash crop. As tobacco exhausted the soil, the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement. This reduced the wooded land which Native Americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops. As more colonists arrived, they wanted more land. The tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists. Major conflicts took place in the Indian massacre of 1622 and the Second Anglo-Powhatan war, both under the leadership of the late Chief Powhatan's younger brother, Chief Opechancanough. By the mid-17th century, the Powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population, due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases, such as smallpox and measles, to which they had no natural immunity. The European colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the James River. Fifty years earlier, this territory had been the empire of the mighty Powhatan Confederacy. Surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony. Some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage. In the 21st century, the Pamunkey and Mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the English. , the state has recognized eleven Virginia Indian tribes. Others have renewed interest in seeking state and Federal recognition since the celebration of the 400th anniversary of Jamestown in 2007. State celebrations gave Native American tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state. While the developments of 1619 and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the English, many aspects, especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco, were the source of increasing concern to the Native Americans most affected, the Powhatan. By this time, the remaining Powhatan Empire was led by Chief Opechancanough, chief of the Pamunkey, and brother of Chief Powhatan. He had earned a reputation as a fierce warrior under his brother's chiefdom. Soon, he gave up on hopes of diplomacy, and resolved to eradicate the English colonists. On March 22, 1622, the Powhatan killed about 400 colonists in the Indian Massacre of 1622. With coordinated attacks, they struck almost all the English settlements along the James River, on both shores, from Newport News Point on the east at Hampton Roads all the way west upriver to Falling Creek, a few miles above Henricus and John Rolfe's plantation, Varina Farms.J. Frederick Fausz, \\"The 'Barbarous Massacre' Reconsidered: The Powhatan Uprising of 1622 and the Historians,\\" Explorations in Ethnic Studies, vol 1 (Jan. 1978), 16‚Äì36 At Jamestown, a warning by an Indian boy named Chanco to his employer, Richard Pace, helped reduce total deaths. Pace secured his plantation, and rowed across the river during the night to alert Jamestown, which allowed colonists some defensive preparation. They had no time to warn outposts, which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location. Several entire communities were essentially wiped out, including Henricus and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin's Hundred. At the Falling Creek Ironworks, which had been seen as promising for the Colony, two women and three children were among the 27 killed, leaving only two colonists alive. The facilities were destroyed. Despite the losses, two thirds of the colonists survived; after withdrawing to Jamestown, many returned to the outlying plantations, although some were abandoned. The English carried out reprisals against the Powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and Powhatan struck a truce. The colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to Jamestown, where they proposed a toast of liquor. Dr. John Potts and some of the Jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives' share of the liquor, which killed about 200 men. Colonists killed another 50 Indians by hand. The period between the coup of 1622 and another Powhatan attack on English colonists along the James River (see Jamestown) in 1644 marked a turning point in the relations between the Powhatan and the English. In the early period, each side believed it was operating from a position of power; by the Treaty of 1646, the colonists had taken the balance of power, and had established control between the York and Blackwater Rivers. Royal colony In 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked and the colony transferred to royal authority as a crown colony, but the elected representatives in Jamestown continued to exercise a fair amount of power. Under royal authority, the colony began to expand to the North and West with additional settlements. In 1634, a new system of local government was created in the Virginia Colony by order of the King of England. Eight shires were designated, each with its own local officers; these shires were renamed as counties only a few years later. =Governor Berkeley and English Civil War= Slaves processing tobacco for export 1670 The first significant attempts at exploring the Trans-Allegheny region occurred under the administration of Governor William Berkeley. Efforts to explore farther into Virginia were hampered in 1644 when about 500 colonists were killed in another Indian massacre led, once again, by Opechancanough. Berkeley is credited with efforts to develop others sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large Green Spring Plantation. The colonists defined the 1644 coup as an \\"uprising\\". Chief Opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position: that the colonists were violating their pledges to the Powhatan. During the 1644 event, Chief Opechancanough was captured. While imprisoned, he was murdered by one of his guards. After the death of Opechancanough, and following the repeated colonial attacks in 1644 and 1645, the remaining Powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers.Gleach p. 199 Most Virginia colonists were loyal to the crown (Charles I) during the English Civil War, but in 1652, Oliver Cromwell sent a force to remove and replace Gov. Berkeley with Governor Richard Bennett, who was loyal to the Commonwealth of England. This governor was a moderate Puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority, and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring Maryland Colony. Bennett was followed by two more \\"Cromwellian\\" governors, Edward Digges and Samuel Matthews, although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees, but were selected by the House of Burgesses, which was really in control of the colony during these years.John Esten Cooke, Virginia: A History of the People (1883) p. 205. Many royalists fled to Virginia after their defeat in the English Civil War. Some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in Virginia such as the Washingtons, Randolphs, Carters and Lees. However, most 17th-century immigrants were indentured servants, merchants or artisans. After the Restoration, in recognition of Virginia's loyalty to the crown, King Charles II of England bestowed Virginia with the nickname \\"The Old Dominion\\", which it still bears today.Heinemann, Ronald L., et al., Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: a history of Virginia 1607-2007, U. Virginia Press 2007 , p.44-45 =Bacon's Rebellion= Governor Berkeley, who remained popular after his first administration, returned to the governorship at the end of Commonwealth rule. However, Berkeley's second administration was characterized with many problems. Disease, hurricanes, Indian hostilities, and economic difficulties all plagued Virginia at this time. Berkeley established autocratic authority over the colony. To protect this power, he refused to have new legislative elections for 14 years in order to protect a House of Burgesses that supported him. He only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat. Berkeley finally did face a rebellion in 1676. Indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west. Serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counter-attack against the wrong tribe, which further extended the violence. Berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight. Many settlers and historians believe Berkeley's refusal to fight the Indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade. Large scale fighting would have cut off the Indian suppliers Berkeley's investment relied on. Nathaniel Bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the Indians. Bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of Berkeley, not only on the issue of Indians, but on other issues as well. Berkeley condemned Bacon as a rebel, but pardoned him after Bacon won a seat in the House of Burgesses and accepted it peacefully. After a lack of reform, Bacon rebelled outright, captured Jamestown, and took control of the colony for several months. The incident became known as Bacon's Rebellion. Berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the English militia. Bacon burned Jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion, but died of disease. Berkeley severely crushed the remaining rebels. In response to Berkeley's harsh repression of the rebels, the English government removed him from office. After the burning of Jamestown, the capital was temporarily moved to Middle Plantation, located on the high ground of the Virginia Peninsula equidistant from the James and York Rivers.Wilcomb E. Washburn, The Governor and the Rebel: A History of Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia (1957) The Bodleian Plate, showing (top row; also middle row, center) the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary; (middle row left) views of the first Capitol at Williamsburg; (middle-row right) the Governor's Palace. =Building of Williamsburg= Local leaders had long desired a school of higher education, for the sons of planters, and for educating the Indians. An earlier attempt to establish a permanent university at Henricus failed after the Indian Massacre of 1622 wiped out the entire settlement. Finally, seven decades later, with encouragement from the Colony's House of Burgesses and other prominent individuals, Reverend Dr. James Blair, the colony's top religious leader, prepared a plan. Blair went to England and in 1693, obtained a charter from Protestants King William and Queen Mary II of England who had just deposed Catholic James II of England in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. The college was named the College of William and Mary in honor of the two monarchs. The rebuilt statehouse in Jamestown burned again in 1698. After that fire, upon suggestion of college students, the colonial capital was permanently moved to nearby Middle Plantation again, and the town was renamed Williamsburg, in honor of the king. Plans were made to construct a capitol building and plan the new city according to the survey of Theodorick Bland. =Tobacco plantations= Byrd plantation, showing how imports and exports came by ship to the front door As the English increasingly used tobacco products, tobacco in the American colonies became a significant economic force, especially in the tidewater region surrounding the Chesapeake Bay. Vast plantations were built along the rivers of Virginia, and social/economic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop. Some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops. Planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses. In 1730, the Virginia House of Burgesses standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730, which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 specified locations. =Social structure= In terms of the white population, the top five percent or so were planters who possessed growing wealth and increasing political power and social prestige. They controlled the local Anglican church, choosing ministers and handling church property and disbursing local charity. They sought elected and appointed offices. About 60 percent of white Virginians were part of a broad middle class that owned substantial farms; By the second generation, death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible. The bottom third owned no land, and verged on poverty. Many were recent arrivals, or recently released from indentured servitude.Alan Taylor, American Colonies: The Settling of North America (2002) p 157. Social stratification was most severe in the Northern Neck, where the Fairfax family had been given a proprietorship. In some districts there 70 percent of the land was owned by a handful of families, and three-fourths of the whites had no land at all. In the frontier districts, large numbers of Irish and German Protestants had settled, often moving down from Pennsylvania. Tobacco was not important there; farmers focused on hemp, grain, cattle, and horses. Entrepreneurs had begun to mine and smelt the local iron ores.John E. Selby, The Revolution in Virginia, 1775-1783 (1988) p 24-25. Sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level, starting at the top. In England hunting was sharply restricted to landowners, and enforced by armed gameskeepers. In America, game was more than plentiful. Everyone‚Äîincluding servants and slaves‚Äîcould and did hunt. Poor men with a good rifle aim won praise; rich gentlemen who were off target won ridicule. In 1691, Sir Francis Nicholson, the governor, organized competitions for the \\"better sort of Virginians onely who are Batchelors,\\" and he offered prizes \\"to be shot for, wrastled, played at backswords, & Run for by Horse and foott.\\"Quoted in Nancy L. Struna, \\"The Formalizing of Sport and the Formation of an Elite: The Chesapeake Gentry, 1650-1720s.\\" Journal of Sport History 13#3 (1986) p 219. online Horse racing was the main event. The typical farmer did not own a horse in the first place, and racing was a matter for gentlemen only, but ordinary farmers were spectators and gamblers. Selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers. Horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together. The race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding, training, boasting and gambling, and especially winning the races themselves.Struna, The Formalizing of Sport and the Formation of an Elite pp 212-16. Historian Timothy Breen explains that horse racing and high-stakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry. When they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse, it told the world that competitiveness, individualism, and materialism where the core elements of gentry values.Timothy H. Breen, \\"Horses and gentlemen: The cultural significance of gambling among the gentry of Virginia.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1977) 34#2 pp: 239-257. online Historian Edmund Morgan (1975) argues that Virginians in the 1650s‚Äîand for the next two centuries‚Äîturned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict. \\"Racism made it possible for white Virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that English republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty.\\" That is, white men became politically much more equal than was possible without a population of low-status slaves.Edmund Morgan, American Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia (1975) p 386 By 1700, the population reached 70,000 and continued to grow rapidly from a high birth rate, low death rate, importation of slaves from the Caribbean, and immigration from Britain and Germany, as well as from Pennsylvania. The climate was mild, the farm lands were cheap and fertile.Heinemann, Old Dominion, New Commonwealth (2007) 83‚Äì90 =Early to mid-1700s: Westward expansion= Between 1730 and 1776, the Virginia colony expanded past the Shenandoah valley to encompass modern day West Virginia, Kentucky, and most of the Northwest Territory. 1751 Fry- Jefferson map depicting 'The Great Waggon Road to Philadelphia' In 1716, Governor Alexander Spotswood led the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition, reaching the top ridge of the Blue Ridge Mountains at Swift Run Gap (elevation ).Gene Wilhelm, Jr., \\"Folk Culture History of the Blue Ridge Mountains\\" Appalachian Journal (1975) 2#3 in JSTORDelma R.

Around this time, Governor William Gooch promoted settlement of the Virginia backcountry as a means to insulate the Virginia colony from Native American and New France settlements in the Ohio CountryEncyclopedia Virginia article: \\"Backcountry Frontier of Colonial Virginia\\" online In response, a wide variety of settlers traveled southward on the Indian Trail later known as the Great Wagon Road along the Shenandoah Valley from Pennsylvania. Many, including German Palatines and Scotch-Irish American immigrants, settled along former Indian camps. According to Encyclopedia Virginia, \\"By 1735 there were as many as 160 families in the backcountry region, and within ten years nearly 10,000 Europeans lived in the Shenandoah Valley.\\"Encyclopedia Virginia article: \\"Backcountry Frontier of Colonial Virginia\\" http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Backcountry_Frontier_of_Colonial_Virginia#start_entry 1736-37 map of the Northern Neck Proprietary As colonial settlement moved into the piedmont area from the Tidewater/Chesapeake area,http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/fairfaxgrant.html Once colonial settlement moved upstream of the Fall Line into the Piedmont, the dispute over the inland edge of the Northern Neck grant became an issue. Settlers seeking clear title had to know whether to file paperwork and pay fees to the colonial government in Williamsburg or the land office of the Fairfax family.

Once this legal battle was ironed out, Frederick County, Virginia was founded in 1743 and the \\"Frederick Town\\" settlements there became a fourth city charter in Virginia, now known as Winchester, Virginia in February 1752.Historical Statement Relative to the Town of Winchester the Virginia -- House of Burgesses granted the fourth city charter in Virginia to 'Winchester' as Frederick Town was renamed. New borders drawn by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. In the late 1740s and the second half of the 18th century, the British angled for control of the Ohio Country. Virginians Thomas Lee and brothers Lawrence and Augustine Washington organized the Ohio Company to represent the prospecting and trading interests of Virginian investors. In 1749, the British Crown, via the colonial government of Virginia, granted the Ohio Company a great deal of this territory on the condition that it be settled by British colonists. Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company, which stood to lose money if the French held their claim.O'Meara, p. 48 To counter the French military presence in Ohio, in October 1753 Dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old Major George Washington (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory.Anderson (2000), pp. 42‚Äì43 Ultimately, many Virginians were caught up in the resulting French and Indian War that occurred 1754‚Äì1763. At the completion of the war, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade all British settlement past a line drawn along the Appalachian Mountains, with the land west of the Proclamation Line known as the Indian Reserve. British colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the British government had already assigned land grants to them. Many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line,Gordon S. Wood, The American Revolution, A History. New York, Modern Library, 2002 , p.22 some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac's War, and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled. For example, George Washington and his Virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary. Prominent American colonials joined with the land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west. Their efforts were successful, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Native Americans. In 1768, the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the Treaty of Hard Labour, followed in 1770 by the Treaty of Lochaber, opened much of what is now Kentucky and West Virginia to British settlement within the Virginia Colony. However, the Northwest Territories north of the Ohio continued to be occupied by native tribes until US forces drove them out in the early decades of the 1800s. Religion :Further information: Episcopal Diocese of Virginia:History St. Luke's Church in Smithfield, built in the early- to mid-17th century, is the oldest extant brick church in the Thirteen colonies, and the only existing Gothic brick structure in the United States. The Church of England was legally established in the colony in 1619, and the Bishop of London sent in 22 Anglican clergyman by 1624. In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister. There never was a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry, consisting of gentry laymen controlled the parish.Edward L. Bond and Joan R. Gundersen, The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607‚Äì2007 (2007) By the 1740s, the Anglicans had about 70 parish priests around the colony. Missionaries were sent to the Indians but they had little success apart from the Nansemond tribe, which had converted in 1638. The other Powhatan tribes converted to Christianity around 1791.Rountree p. 161‚Äì162, 168‚Äì170, 175 The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening in the mid 18th century, which pulled people away from the formal rituals of the established church.Edward L. Bond, \\"Anglican theology and devotion in James Blair's Virginia, 1685‚Äì1743,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, (1996) 104#3 pp 313‚Äì40 Especially in the back country, most families had no religious affiliation whatsoever and their low moral standards were shocking to proper Englishmen.Charles Woodmason, The Carolina Backcountry on the Eve of the Revolution: The Journal and Other Writings of Charles Woodmason, Anglican Itinerant ed. by Richard J. Hooker (1969) The Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians and other evangelicals directly challenged these lax moral standards and refused to tolerate them in their ranks. Baptists, German Lutherans and Presbyterians, funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church. The spellbinding preacher Samuel Davies led the Presbyterians, and converted hundreds of slaves. By the 1760s Baptists were drawing Virginians, especially poor white farmers, into a new, much more democratic religion. Slaves were welcome at the services and many became Baptists at this time. Methodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period. Methodists encouraged an end to slavery, and welcomed free blacks and slaves into active roles in the congregations. The Baptists and Presbyterians were subject to many legal constraints and faced growing persecution; between 1768 and 1774, about half of the Baptists ministers in Virginia were jailed for preaching, in defiance of England's Act of Toleration of 1689 that guaranteed freedom of worship for Protestants. At the start of the Revolution, the Anglican Patriots realized that they needed dissenter support for effective wartime mobilization, so they met most of the dissenters' demands in return for their support of the war effort.John A. Ragosta, \\"Fighting for Freedom: Virginia Dissenters' Struggle for Religious Liberty during the American Revolution,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, (2008) 116#3 pp. 226‚Äì261 Historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the American Revolution. The struggle for religious toleration was played out during the American Revolution, as the Baptists, in alliance with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, worked successfully to disestablish the Anglican church.Rhys Isaac, \\"Evangelical Revolt: The Nature of the Baptists' Challenge to the Traditional Order in Virginia, 1765 To 1775,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1974) 31#3 pp 345‚Äì368 in JSTOR After the American victory in the war, the Anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion. This effort failed when non- Anglicans gave their support to Jefferson's \\"Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom\\", which eventually became law in 1786 as the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. With freedom of religion the new watchword, the Church of England was dis-established in Virginia. It was rebuilt as the Episcopal Church in the United States, with no connection to Britain. American Revolution =Antecedents= Patrick Henry's speech on the Virginia Resolves. Revolutionary sentiments first began appearing in Virginia shortly after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. The Virginia legislature had passed the Two-Penny Act to stop clerical salaries from inflating. King George III vetoed the measure, and clergy sued for back salaries. Patrick Henry first came to prominence by arguing in the case of Parson's Cause against the veto, which he declared tyrannical. The British government had accumulated a great deal of debt through spending on its wars. To help payoff this debt, Parliament passed the Sugar Act in 1764 and the Stamp Act in 1765. The General Assembly opposed the passage of the Sugar Act on the grounds of no taxation without representation, and in turn passing the \\"Virginia Resolves\\" opposing the tax. Governor Francis Fauquier responded by dismissing the Assembly. The Northampton County court overturned the Stamp Act February 8, 1766. Various political groups, including the Sons of Liberty met and issued protests against the act. Most notably, Richard Bland published a pamphlet entitled An Enquiry into the Rights of The British Colonies, setting forth the principle that Virginia was a part of the British Empire, not the Kingdom of Great Britain, so it only owed allegiance to the Crown, not Parliament. The Stamp Act was repealed, but additional taxation from the Revenue Act and the 1769 attempt to transport Bostonian rioters to London for trial incited more protest from Virginia. The Assembly met to consider resolutions condemning on the transport of the rioters, but Governor Botetourt, while sympathetic, dissolved the legislature. The Burgesses reconvened in Raleigh Tavern and made an agreement to ban British imports. Britain gave up the attempt to extradite the prisoners and lifted all taxes except the tax on tea in 1770. In 1773, because of a renewed attempt to extradite Americans to Britain, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, George Mason, and others in the legislature created a committee of correspondence to deal with problems with Britain. This committee would serve as the foundation for Virginia's role in the American Revolution. After the House of Burgesses expressed solidarity with the actions in Massachusetts, the Governor, Lord Dunmore, again dissolved the legislature. The first Virginia Convention was held August 1‚Äì6 to respond to the growing crisis. The convention approved a boycott of British goods and elected delegates to the Continental Congress. =War begins= Lord Dunmore fleeing to the Fowey On April 20, 1775, Dunmore ordered the gunpowder removed from the Williamsburg Magazine to a British ship. Patrick Henry led a group of Virginia militia from Hanover in response to Dunmore's order. Carter Braxton negotiated a resolution to the Gunpowder Incident by transferring royal funds as payment for the powder. The incident exacerbated Dunmore's declining popularity. He fled the Governor's Palace to a British ship at Yorktown. On November 7, Dunmore issued a proclamation declaring Virginia was in a state of rebellion. By this time, George Washington had been appointed head of the American forces by the Continental Congress and Virginia was under the political leadership of a Committee of Safety formed by the Third Virginia Convention in the governor's absence. On December 9, 1775, Virginia militia moved on the governor's forces at the Battle of Great Bridge, winning a victory in the small action there. Dunmore responded by bombarding Norfolk with his ships on January 1, 1776. After the Battle of Great Bridge, little military conflict took place on Virginia soil for the first part of the American Revolutionary War. Nevertheless, Virginia sent forces to help in the fighting to the North and South, as well as the frontier in the northwest. =Independence= The Fifth Virginia Convention met on May 6 and declared Virginia a free and independent state on May 15, 1776. The convention instructed its delegates to introduce a resolution for independence at the Continental Congress. Richard Henry Lee introduced the measure on June 7. While the Congress debated, the Virginia Convention adopted George Mason's Bill of Rights (June 12) and a constitution (June 29) which established an independent commonwealth. Congress approved Lee's proposal on July 2 and approved Jefferson's Declaration of Independence on July 4. The constitution of the Fifth Virginia Convention created a system of government for the state that would last for 54 years, and converting House of Burgesses into a bicameral legislature with both a House of Delegates and a Senate. Patrick Henry serves as the first Governor of the Commonwealth (1776-1779). =War returns to Virginia= Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown (John Trumbull, 1797) The British briefly brought the war back to coastal Virginia in May 1779. Fearing the vulnerability of Williamsburg, Governor Thomas Jefferson moved the capital farther inland to Richmond in 1780. However, in December, Benedict Arnold, who had betrayed the Revolution and become a general for the British, attacked Richmond and burned part of the city before the Virginia Militia drove his army out of the city. Arnold moved his base of operations to Portsmouth and was later joined by troops under General William Phillips. Phillips led an expedition that destroyed military and economic targets, against ineffectual militia resistance. The state's defenses, led by General Baron von Steuben, put up resistance in the April 1781 Battle of Blandford, but were forced to retreat. The French General Lafayette and his forces arrived to help defend Virginia, and though outnumbered, engaged British forces under General Charles Cornwallis in a series of skirmishes to help reduce their effectiveness. Cornwallis dispatched two smaller missions under Colonel John Graves Simcoe and Colonel Banastre Tarleton to march on Charlottesville and capture Gov. Jefferson and the legislature, though was foiled when Jack Jouett rode to warn Virginia government. Cornwallis moved down the Virginia Peninsula towards the Chesapeake Bay, where Clinton planned to extract part of the army for a siege of New York City. After surprising American forces at the Battle of Green Spring on July 6, 1781, Cornwallis received orders to move his troops to the port town of Yorktown and begin construction of fortifications and a naval yard, though when discovered American forces surrounded the town. Gen. Washington and his French ally Rochambeau moved their forces from New York to Virginia. The defeat of the Royal Navy by Admiral de Grasse at the Battle of the Virginia Capes ensured French dominance of the waters around Yorktown, thereby preventing Cornwallis from receiving troops or supplies and removing the possibility of evacuation. Following the two-week siege to Yorktown, Cornwallis decided to surrender. Papers for surrender were officially signed on October 19. As a result of the defeat, the king lost control of Parliament and the new British government offered peace in April 1782. The Treaty of Paris of 1783 officially ended the war. Early Republic and antebellum periods The new Virginia State Capitol, begun in 1785 and completed in 1792, designed by Thomas Jefferson following the relocation of the government to Richmond (as it appeared in the mid-19th century). Victory in the Revolution brought peace and prosperity to the new state, as export markets in Europe reopened for its tobacco. While the old local elites were content with the status quo, younger veterans of the war had developed a national identity. Led by George Washington and James Madison, Virginia played a major role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia. Madison proposed the Virginia Plan, which would give representation in Congress according to total population, including a proportion of slaves. Virginia was the most populous state, and it was allowed to count all of its white residents and 3/5 of the enslaved African Americans for its congressional representation and its electoral vote. (Only white men who owned a certain amount of property could vote.) Ratification was bitterly contested; the pro-Constitution forces prevailed only after promising to add a Bill of Rights. The Virginia Ratifying Convention approved the Constitution by a vote of 89‚Äì79 on June 25, 1788, making it the tenth state to enter the Union.Pauline Maier, Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787‚Äì1788 (2010) pp. 235‚Äì319 Madison played a central role in the new Congress, while Washington was the unanimous choice as first president. He was followed by the Virginia Dynasty, including Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, giving the state four of the first five presidents. =Slavery and freedmen in Antebellum Virginia= The Revolution meant change and sometimes political freedom for enslaved African Americans, too. Tens of thousands of slaves from southern states, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina, escaped to British lines and freedom during the war. Thousands left with the British for resettlement in their colonies of Nova Scotia and Jamaica; others went to England; others disappeared into rural and frontier areas or the North.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73 Inspired by the Revolution and evangelical preachers, numerous slaveholders in the Chesapeake region manumitted some or all of their slaves, during their lifetimes or by will. From 1,800 persons in 1782, the total population of free blacks in Virginia increased to 12,766 (4.3 percent of blacks) in 1790, and to 30,570 in 1810; the percentage change was from free blacks' comprising less than one percent of the total black population in Virginia, to 7.2 percent by 1810, even as the overall population increased.Kolchin, American Slavery, p. 81 One planter, Robert Carter III freed more than 450 slaves in his lifetime, more than any other planter. George Washington freed all of his slaves at his death.Andrew Levy, The First Emancipator: The Forgotten Story of Robert Carter, the Founding Father who freed his slaves, New York: Random House, 2005 () Many free blacks migrated from rural areas to towns such as Petersburg, Richmond, and Charlottesville for jobs and community; others migrated with their families to the frontier where social strictures were more relaxed.Scott Nesbit, \\"Scales Intimate and Sprawling: Slavery, Emancipation, and the Geography of Marriage in Virginia\\", Southern Spaces, July 19, 2011. http://southernspaces.org/2011/scales- intimate-and-sprawling-slavery-emancipation-and-geography-marriage-virginia. Among the oldest black Baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near Petersburg before the Revolution. Each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early 19th century.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, New York: Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 137, accessed December 27, 2008 Twice slave rebellions broke out in Virginia: Gabriel's Rebellion in 1800, and Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. White reaction was swift and harsh, and militias killed many innocent free blacks and black slaves as well as those directly involved in the rebellions. After the second rebellion, the legislature passed laws restricting the rights of free people of color: they were excluded from bearing arms, serving in the militia, gaining education, and assembling in groups. As bearing arms and serving in the militia were considered obligations of free citizens, free blacks came under severe constraints after Nat Turner's rebellion. =Westward emigration= In the late 18th century, the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap in far southwestern Virginia served as a key route across the Appalachians to Kentucky, and for points west until the National Road opened in the early 19th century. As the new nation of the United States of America experienced growing pains and began to speak of Manifest Destiny, Virginia, too, found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging. For one, the vast lands of the Virginia Colony were subdivided into other US states and territories. In 1784, Virginia relinquished its claims to the Illinois County, Virginia, except for the Virginia Military District (Southern Indiana). In 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky. This Wilderness Road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach Kentucky from the East. The fledgling US government rewarded veterans of the Revolutionary War with plots of land along the Ohio River in the Northwest Territory. In 1792, three western counties split off to form Kentucky. A second influence: the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west. Virginia's heavy farming of tobacco for 200 years had depleted its soils.\\"Soil exhaustion in the Tidewater became chronic, and the Piedmont was \\"worn out, washed and gullied.\\" Conditions were better in the Valley of Virginia, where wheat rather than tobacco was dominant, but even there people saw a brighter future outside Virginia.\\" http://www.vahistorical.org/what-you-can-see/story- virginia/explore-story-virginia/1776-1860/becoming-southerners The 1803 Louisiana Purchase only accelerated the westward movement of Virginians out of their native state. Many of the Virginians whose grandparents had created the Virginia Establishment began to emigrate and settle westward. Famous Virginian-born Americans affected not only the destiny of the state of Virginia, but the rapidly developing American Old West. Virginians Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were influential in their famous 1804-1806 expedition to explore the Missouri River and possible connections to the Pacific Ocean. Notable names such as Stephen F. Austin, Edwin Waller, Haden Harrison Edwards, and Dr. John Shackelford were famous Texan pioneers from Virginia. Even eventual Civil War general Robert E. Lee distinguished himself as a military leader in Texas during the 1846‚Äì48 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. =Cultural preservation= Historians estimate that one million Virginians left the commonwealth between the Revolution and the Civil War.\\"In all, perhaps one million Virginians left the commonwealth between the Revolution and the Civil War.\\" http://www.vahistorical.org/what-you-can-see/story-virginia/explore- story-virginia/1776-1860/becoming-southerners With this exodus, Virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence\\"Virginia fell from first to seventh place in population, and its number of congressmen dropped from twenty-three to eleven.\\" http://www.vahistorical.org/what-you- can-see/story-virginia/explore-story-virginia/1776-1860/becoming-southerners Prominent Virginians formed the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past. At the same time, with Virginians settling so much of the west, they brought their cultural habits with them. Today, many cultural features of the American South can be attributed to Virginians who migrated west.http://www.vahistorical.org/what- you-can-see/story-virginia/explore-story-virginia/1776-1860/becoming- southerners\\"Although this mass exodus of Virginians caused the state to slip into a secondary role both politically and economically, these westward-bound settlers spread their culture, laws, political ideas, and labor system across America.\\" =Cultural divide between Tidewater planters and Western Virginia farmers= As the western reaches of Virginia were developed in the first half of the 19th century, the vast differences in the agricultural basis, cultural, and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the Virginia General Assembly. In the older, eastern portion, slavery contributed to the economy. While planters were moving away from labor-intensive tobacco to mixed crops, they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect. Slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended. Watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the Atlantic Ocean. In the western reaches, families farmed smaller homesteads, mostly without enslaved or hired labor. Settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources: mining of minerals and harvesting of timber. The land drained into the Ohio River Valley, and trade followed the rivers. Representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite. This was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population; as neither the slaves nor women had the vote, this gave more power to white men. The legislature's efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution, although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues. Thus, at the outset of the American Civil War, Virginia was caught not only in national crisis, but in a long-standing controversy within its own boundaries. While other border states had similar regional differences, Virginia had a long history of east-west tensions which finally came to a head; it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the War. Begun in the late 18th century, the James River and Kanawha Canal was intended to form a transportation link between the James River in the east, and the Kanawha River (flowing into the Ohio River) across the Appalachians. =Infrastructure and Industrial Revolution= After the Revolution, various infrastructure projects began to be developed, including the Dismal Swamp Canal, the James River and Kanawha Canal, and various turnpikes. Virginia was home to the first of all Federal infrastructure projects under the new Constitution, the Cape Henry Light of 1792, located at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. Following the War of 1812, several Federal national defense projects were undertaken in Virginia. Drydock Number One was constructed in Portsmouth in the 1827. Across the James River, Fort Monroe was built to defend Hampton Roads, completed in 1834. In the 1830s, railroads began to be built in Virginia. In 1831, the Chesterfield Railroad began hauling coal from the mines in Midlothian to docks at Manchester (near Richmond), powered by gravity and draft animals. The first railroad in Virginia to be powered by locomotives was the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, chartered in 1834, with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at Aquia Landing running to Washington, D.C.. Soon after, others (with equally descriptive names) followed: the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad and Louisa Railroad in 1836, the Richmond and Danville Railroad in 1847, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in 1848, and the Richmond and York River Railroad. In 1849, the Virginia Board of Public Works established the Blue Ridge Railroad. Under Engineer Claudius Crozet, the railroad successfully crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains via the Blue Ridge Tunnel at Afton Mountain. Petersburg became a manufacturing center, as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living. In 1860, half its population was black and of that, one-third were free blacks, the largest such population in the state. Remains of the Washington Iron Furnace in Franklin County, which operated from about 1770 to 1850. Iron industry With extensive iron deposits, especially in the western counties, Virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry. The first ironworks in the new world was established at Falling Creek in 1619, though it was destroyed in 1622. There would eventually grow to be 80 ironworks, charcoal furnaces and forges with 7,000 hands at any one time, about 70 percent of them slaves. Ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers, easier to control, and could not switch to a better employer. But the work ethic was weak, because the wages went to the owner, not to the workers, who were forced to work hard, were poorly fed and clothed, and were separated from their families. Virginia's industry increasingly fell behind Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Ohio, which relied on free labor. Bradford (1959) recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the over-reliance on slaves contributed to the failure of the iron-masters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them. Most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers, although Lewis (1977) reports that some were in skilled positions.S. Sydney Bradford, \\"The Negro Ironworker in Ante Bellum Virginia,\\" Journal of Southern History, May 1959, Vol. 25 Issue 2, pp. 194‚Äì206; Ronald L. Lewis, \\"The Use and Extent of Slave Labor in the Virginia Iron Industry: The Antebellum Era,\\" West Virginia History, Jan 1977, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp. 141‚Äì156For a comparison of Virginia and New Jersey see John Bezis-Selfa, \\"A Tale of Two Ironworks: Slavery, Free Labor, Work, and Resistance in the Early Republic,\\" William & Mary Quarterly, Oct 1999, Vol. 56 Issue 4, pp. 677‚Äì700 Civil War The Battle of Hampton Roads was fought in the James River near Hampton in 1862. Virginia at first refused to join the Confederacy, but did so after President Lincoln on April 15 called for troops from all states; that meant Federal troops crossing Virginia on the way south to subdue South Carolina. On April 17, 1861 the convention voted to secede, and voters ratified the decision on May 23. Immediately the Union army moved into northern Virginia and captured Alexandria without a fight, and controlled it for the remainder of the war. The Wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the Union. Because of its strategic significance, the Confederacy relocated its capital to Richmond. Richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the Confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts. A major center of iron production during the civil war was located in Richmond at Tredegar Iron Works, which produced most of the artillery for the war. The city was the site of numerous army hospitals. Libby Prison for captured Union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions, with a high death rate.see \\"Libby Prison\\", Encyclopedia Virginia, accessed 21 April 2012 Richmond's main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of Petersburg. Saltville was a primary source of Confederate salt (critical for food preservation) during the war, leading to the two Battles of Saltville. The first major battle of the Civil War occurred on July 21, 1861. Union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at Manassas, but the Confederate Army reached it first and won the First Battle of Manassas (known as \\"Bull Run\\" in Northern naming convention). Both sides mobilized for war; the year 1861 went on without another major fight. Men from all economic and social levels, both slaveholders and nonslaveholders, as well as former Unionists, enlisted in great numbers on both sides. Areas, especially in the west and along the border, that sent few men to the Confederacy were characterized by few slaves, poor economies, and a history of reinal antagonism to the Tidewater.Aaron Sheehan-Dean, \\"Everyman's War: Confederate Enlistment in Civil War Virginia,\\" Civil War History, March 2004, Vol. 50 Issue 1, pp. 5‚Äì26 =West Virginia breaks away= The western counties could not tolerate the Confederacy. Breaking away, they first formed the Union state of Virginia (recognized by Washington); it is called the Restored government of Virginia and was based in Alexandria, across the river from Washington. The Restored government did little except give its permission for Congress to form the new state of West Virginia in 1862.The U.S Constitution requires permission of the old state for a new state to form. David R. Zimring, \\"'Secession in Favor of the Constitution': How West Virginia Justified Separate Statehood during the Civil War,\\" West Virginia History, (2009) 3#2 pp. 23‚Äì51Richard O. Curry, A House Divided, Statehood Politics & the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia, (1964), pp. 141‚Äì147. From May to August 1861, a series of Unionist conventions met in Wheeling; the Second Wheeling Convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the Restored Government of Virginia. It declared Virginia was still in the Union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor, Francis H. Pierpont; this body gained formal recognition by the Lincoln administration on July 4.Curry, A House Divided, pg. 73. On August 20 the Wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation; it was put to public vote on Oct. 24. The vote was in favor of a new state‚ÄîWest Virginia‚Äîwhich was distinct from the Pierpont government, which persisted until the end of the war.Curry, A House Divided, pgs. 141‚Äì152. Congress and Lincoln approved, and, after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution, West Virginia became the 35th state on June 20, 1863. In effect there were now three states: the Confederate Virginia, the Union Restored Virginia, and West Virginia.Charles H. Ambler and Festus P. Summers, West Virginia: The Mountain State ch 15‚Äì20 The state and national governments in Richmond did not recognize the new state, and Confederates did not vote there. The Confederate government in Richmond sent in Robert E. Lee. But Lee found little local support and was defeated by Union forces from Ohio. Union victories in 1861 drove the Confederate forces out of the Monongahela and Kanawha valleys, and throughout the remainder of the war the Union held the region west of the Alleghenies and controlled the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the north. The new state was not subject to Reconstruction.Otis K. Rice, West Virginia: A History (1985) ch 12‚Äì14 =Later war years= For the remainder of the war, many major battles were fought across Virginia, including the Seven Days Battles, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Brandy Station Over the course of the War, despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counter-stroke raids, Confederate control of many regions of Virginia was gradually lost to Federal advance. By October 1862 the northern 9th and 10th Congressional districts along the Potomac were under Union control. Eastern Shore, Northern, Middle and Lower Peninsula and the 2nd congressional district surrounding Norfolk west to Suffolk were permanently Union-occupied by May. Other regions, such as the Piedmont and Shenandoah Valley, regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns. In 1864, the Union Army planned to attack Richmond by a direct overland approach through Overland Campaign and the Battle of the Wilderness, culminating in the Siege of Petersburg which lasted from the summer of 1864 to April 1865. By November 6, 1864, Confederate forces controlled only four of Virginia's 16 congressional districts in the region of Richmond-Petersburg and their Southside counties.Kenneth C. Martis, The Historical Atlas of the Congresses of the Confederate States of America 1861-1865 (1994) p. 43-53. In April 1865, Richmond was burned by a retreating Confederate Army ; Lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks. The Confederate government fled south, pausing in Danville for a few days. The end came when Lee surrendered to Ulysses Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865. Reconstruction Remains of a locomotive of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, at the destroyed depot in Richmond. Virginia had been devastated by the war, with the infrastructure (such as railroads) in ruins; many plantations burned out; and large numbers of refugees without jobs, food or supplies beyond rations provided by the Union Army, especially its Freedmen's Bureau.The main scholarly histories are Hamilton James Eckenrode, The Political History of Virginia during the Reconstruction (1904); Richard Lowe, Republicans and Reconstruction in Virginia, 1856‚Äì70 (1991); and Jack P. Maddex, Jr., The Virginia Conservatives, 1867‚Äì1879: A Study in Reconstruction Politics (1970). See also Heinemann et al., New Commonwealth (2007) ch. 11 Historian Mary Farmer-Kaiser reports that white landowners complained to the Bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness, and asked the Bureau to force them to sign labor contracts. In response, many Bureau officials \\"readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the 'hen pecked' husbands who allowed it.\\" While the Bureau did not force freedwomen to work, it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants. Furthermore, agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters. Farmer-Kaiser concludes that \\"Freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau.\\"Mary Farmer-Kaiser, Freedwomen and the Freedmen's Bureau: Race, Gender, and Public Policy in the Age of Emancipation, (Fordham U.P., 2010), quotes pp. 51, 13 There were three phases in Virginia's Reconstruction era: wartime, presidential, and congressional.Richard Lowe, \\"Another Look at Reconstruction in Virginia,\\" Civil War History, March 1986, Vol. 32 Issue 1, pp. 56‚Äì76 Immediately after the war President Andrew Johnson recognized the Francis Harrison Pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government. The Virginia legislature passed Black Codes that severely restricted Freedmen's mobility and rights; they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens, nor could they vote. The state ratified the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the 1861 ordnance of secession. Johnson was satisfied that Reconstruction was complete. Other Republicans in Congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation; the Radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished, and the freedmen given rights of citizens. They also were concerned that Virginia leaders had not renounced Confederate nationalism. After winning large majorities in the 1866 national election, the Radical Republicans gained power in Congress. They put Virginia (and nine other ex-Confederate states) under military rule. Virginia was administered as the \\"First Military District\\" in 1867‚Äì69 under General John Schofield Meanwhile, the Freedmen became politically active by joining the pro-Republican Union League, holding conventions, and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law, as well as demanding disfranchisement of ex-Confederates and the seizure of their plantations. McDonough, finding that Schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the Radical cause on the one hand, and attacked on the other by Radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other, concludes that \\"he performed admirably' by following a middle course between extremes.James L. McDonough, \\"John Schofield as Military Director of Reconstruction in Virginia.,\\" Civil War History, Sept 1969, Vol. 15#3, pp. 237‚Äì256 Increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks. The moderate element had national support and called itself \\"True Republicans.\\" The more radical element set out to disfranchise whites‚Äîsuch as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the Confederate army, or had sold food to the Confederate government, plus land reform. About 20,000 former Confederates were denied the right to vote in the 1867 election.Heinemann, et al. Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: A History of Virginia, 1607‚Äì2007 (2007) p 248. In 1867, radical James Hunnicutt (1814‚Äì1880), a white preacher, editor and Scalawag (white Southerners supporting Reconstruction) mobilized the black Republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to Freedmen and poor whites. The \\"True Republicans\\" (the moderates), led by former Whigs, businessmen and planters, while supportive of black suffrage, drew the line at property confiscation. A compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters.Eric Foner, Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War (1980) p 146 Hunnicutt's coalition took control of the Republican Party, and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the Confederacy. The Virginia Republican party became permanently split, and many moderate Republicans switched to the opposition \\"Conservatives\\".James E. Bond, No Easy Walk to Freedom: Reconstruction and the Ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment (Praeger, 1997) p. 156. The Radicals won the 1867 election for delegates to a constitutional convention.Eckenrode, The Political History of Virginia during the Reconstruction, ch 5 An industrial school set up for ex-slaves in Richmond during Reconstruction The 1868 constitutional convention included 33 white Conservatives, and 72 Radicals (of whom 24 were Blacks, 23 Scalawag, and 21 Carpetbaggers.The Carpetbaggers were Northern whites who had moved to Virginia after the war. Heinemann et al., New Commonwealth (2007) p. 248 Called the \\"Underwood Constitution\\" after the presiding officer, the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system, and create a system of free public schools for the first time in Virginia.Note: In order to gain public education, black delegates had to accept segregation in the schools. After heated debates over disfranchising Confederates, the Virginia legislature approved a Constitution that excluded ex-Confederates from holding office, but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections.Eckenrode, The Political History of Virginia during the Reconstruction, ch 6 Under pressure from national Republicans to be more moderate, General Schofield continued to administer the state through the Army. He appointed a personal friend, Henry H. Wells as provisional governor. Wells was a Carpetbagger and a former Union general. Schofield and Wells fought and defeated Hunnicutt and the Scalawag Republicans. They took away contracts for state printing orders from Hunnicutt's newspaper. The national government ordered elections in 1869 that included a vote on the new Underwood constitution, a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels, and a separate vote for state officials. The Army enrolled the Freedmen (ex-slaves) as voters but would not allow some 20,000 prominent whites to vote or hold office. The Republicans nominated Wells for governor, as Hunnicutt and most Scalawags went over to the opposition.Eckenrode, The Political History of Virginia during the Reconstruction, ch 7 The leader of the moderate Republicans, calling themselves \\"True Republicans,\\" was William Mahone (1826‚Äì1895), a railroad president and former Confederate general. He formed a coalition of white Scalawag Republicans, some blacks, and ex-Democrats who formed the Conservative Party. Mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war, including civil rights and the vote for Freedmen. Mahone convinced the Conservative Party to drop its own candidate and endorse Gilbert C. Walker, Mahone's candidate for governor. In return, Mahone's people endorsed Conservatives for the legislative races. Mahone's plan worked, as the voters in 1869 elected Walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of ex- Confederates.Walker had 119,535 votes and Wells 101,204. The new Underwood Constitution was approved overwhelmingly, but the disfranchisement clauses were rejected by 3:2 ratios. The new legislature was controlled by the Conservative Party, which soon absorbed the \\"True Republicans\\". Eckenrode, The Political History of Virginia during the Reconstruction, p. 411 When the new legislature ratified the 14th and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Congress seated its delegation, and Virginia Reconstruction came to an end in January 1870. The Radical Republicans had been ousted in a non-violent election.Ku Klux Klan chapters were formed in Virginia in the early years after the war, but they played a negligible role in state politics and soon vanished. Heinemann et al., New Commonwealth (2007) p. 249 Virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more Radical Republican principles. Suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor, white Virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes.Nelson M. Blake, William Mahone of Virginia: Soldier and Political Insurgent (1935) Historian Richard Lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the Radical Republican movement made their cause hopeless: : even more damaging to Republicans' prospects than their poverty, their inexperience in state politics, their isolation from potential allies, and their identification with the heated North was the perverse and powerful racism that ran so powerfully through the white community. The great majority of the Old Dominion's white citizens could not take seriously a political party composed primarily of former slaves.Richard Lowe, Republicans and Reconstruction in Virginia, 1856-70 (1991) p 119 Gilded Age =Railroad and industrial growth= The Triple Crossing in Richmond, finished in 1901, was the intersection of (from top to bottom) the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, the Seaboard Air Line, and the Southern Railway In addition to those that were rebuilt, new railroads developed after the Civil War. In 1868, under railroad baron Collis P. Huntington, the Virginia Central Railroad was merged and transformed into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. In 1870, several railroads were merged to form the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad, later renamed Norfolk & Western. In 1880, the towpath of the now-defunct James River & Kanawha canal was transformed into the Richmond and Allegheny Railroad, which within a decade would merge into the Chesapeake & Ohio. Others would include the Southern Railroad, the Seaboard Air Line, and the Atlantic Coast Line; still others would eventually reach into Virginia, including the Baltimore & Ohio and the Pennsylvania Railroad. The rebuilt Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad eventually was linked to Washington, D.C.. In the 1880s, the Pocahontas Coalfield opened up in far southwest Virginia, with others to follow, in turn providing more demand for railroads transportation. In 1909, the Virginian Railway opened, built for the express purpose of hauling coal from the mountains of West Virginia to the ports at Hampton Roads. The growth of railroads resulted in the creation of new towns and rapid growth of others, including Clifton Forge, Roanoke, Crewe and Victoria. The railroad boom was not without incident: the Wreck of the Old 97 occurred just north of Danville, Virginia in 1903, later immortalized by a popular ballad. With the invention of the cigarette rolling machine, and the great increase in smoking in the early 20th century, cigarettes and other tobacco products became a major industry in Richmond and Petersburg. Tobacco magnates such as Lewis Ginter funded a number of public institutions. =Readjustment, public education, segregation= Former Confederate General William Mahone led the Readjuster Party during the 1870s. A division among Virginia politicians occurred in the 1870s, when those who supported a reduction of Virginia's pre-war debt (\\"Readjusters\\") opposed those who felt Virginia should repay its entire debt plus interest (\\"Funders\\"). Virginia's pre-war debt was primarily for infrastructure improvements overseen by the Virginia Board of Public Works, much of which were destroyed during the war or in the new State of West Virginia. After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1877, former confederate General and railroad executive William Mahone became the leader of the \\"Readjusters\\", forming a coalition of conservative Democrats and white and black Republicans. The so-called Readjusters aspired \\"to break the power of wealth and established privilege\\" and to promote public education. The party promised to \\"readjust\\" the state debt in order to protect funding for newly established public education, and allocate a fair share to the new State of West Virginia. Its proposal to repeal the poll tax and increase funding for schools and other public facilities attracted biracial and cross-party support. The Readjuster Party was successful in electing its candidate, William E. Cameron as governor, and he served from 1882 to 1886. Mahone served as a Senator in the U.S. Congress from 1881 to 1887, as well as fellow Readjustor Harrison H. Riddleberger, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1883 to 1889. Readjusters' effective control of Virginia politics lasted until 1883, when they lost majority control in the state legislature, followed by the election of Democrat Fitzhugh Lee as governor in 1885. The Virginia legislature replaced both Mahone and Riddleberger in the U.S. Senate with Democrats. In 1888, the exception to Readjustor and Democratic control was John Mercer Langston, who was elected to Congress from the Petersburg area on the Republican ticket. He was the first black elected to Congress from the state, and the last for nearly a century. He served one term. A talented and vigorous politician, he was an Oberlin College graduate. He had long been active in the abolitionist cause in Ohio before the Civil War, had been president of the National Equal Rights League from 1864 to 1868, and had headed and created the law department at Howard University, and acted as president of the college. When elected, he was president of what became Virginia State University. While the Readjustor Party faded, the goal of public education remained strong, with institutions established for the education of schoolteachers. In 1884, the state acquired a bankrupt women's college at Farmville and opened it as a normal school. Growth of public education led to the need for additional teachers. In 1908, two additional normal schools were established, one at Fredericksburg and one at Harrisonburg, and in 1910, one at Radford. After the Readjuster Party disappeared, Virginia Democrats rapidly passed legislation and constitutional amendments that effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites, through the use of poll taxes and literacy tests. They created white, one-party rule under the Democratic Party for the next 80 years. White state legislators passed statutes that restored white supremacy through imposition of Jim Crow segregation. In 1902, Virginia passed a new constitution that reduced voter registration. Progressive Era Lexington High School by architect Charles M. Robinson, built in 1908, was typical of the modern public schools that cities built during the Progressive Era. The Progressive Era after 1900 brought numerous reforms, designed to modernize the state, increase efficiency, apply scientific methods, promote education and eliminate waste and corruption. A key leader was Governor Claude Swanson (1906‚Äì10), a Democrat who left machine politics behind to win office using the new primary law. Swanson's coalition of reformers in the legislature, built schools and highways, raised teacher salaries and standards, promoted the state's public health programs, and increased funding for prisons. Swanson fought against child labor, lowered railroad rates and raised corporate taxes, while systematizing state services and introducing modern management techniques. The state funded a growing network of roads, with much of the work done by black convicts in chain gangs. After Swanson moved to the U.S. Senate in 1910 he promoted Progressivism at the national level as a supporter of President Woodrow Wilson, who had been born in Virginia and was considered a native son. Swanson, as a power on naval affairs, promoted the Norfolk Navy Yard and Newport News Ship Building and Drydock Corporation. Swanson's statewide organization evolved into the \\"Byrd Organization.\\"Henry C. Ferrell, Claude A. Swanson of Virginia: a political biography (1985) The State Corporation Commission (SCC) was formed as part of the 1902 Constitution, over the opposition of the railroads, to regulate railroad policies and rates. The SCC was independent of parties, courts, and big businesses, and was designed to maximize the public interest. It became an effective agency, which especially pleased local merchants by keeping rates low.George Harrison Gilliam, \\"Making Virginia Progressive,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1999, Vol. 107 Issue 2, pp. 189‚Äì222 Virginia has a long history of agricultural reformers, and the Progressive Era stimulated their efforts. Rural areas suffered persistent problems, such as declining populations, widespread illiteracy, poor farming techniques, and debilitating diseases among both farm animals and farm families. Reformers emphasized the need to upgrade the quality of elementary education. With federal help, in they set up a county agent system (today the Virginia Cooperative Extension) that taught farmers the latest scientific methods for dealing with tobacco and other crops, and farm house wives how to maximize their efficiency in the kitchen and nursery.Lex Renda, \\"The Advent of Agricultural Progressivism in Virginia,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1988, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 55‚Äì82 Some upper-class women, typified by Lila Meade Valentine of Richmond, promoted numerous Progressive reforms, including kindergartens, teacher education, visiting nurses programs, and vocational education for both races. Middle- class white women were especially active in the Prohibition movement.Lloyd C. Taylor, Jr. \\"Lila Meade Valentine: The FFV as Reformer,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1962, Vol. 70 Issue 4, pp. 471‚Äì487 The woman suffrage movement became entangled in racial issues‚Äîwhites were reluctant to allow black women the vote‚Äîand was unable to broaden its base beyond middle-class whites. Virginia women got the vote in 1920, the result of a national constitutional amendment.Sara Hunter Graham, \\"Woman Suffrage In Virginia: The Equal Suffrage League and Pressure-Group Politics, 1909‚Äì1920,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1993, Vol. 101 Issue 2, pp. 227‚Äì250 In higher education, the key leader was Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia, 1904‚Äì31. His goal was the transformation of the southern university into a force for state service and intellectual leadership. and educational utility. Alderman successfully professionalized and modernized the state's system of higher education. He promoted international standards of scholarship, and a statewide network of extension services. Joined by other college presidents, he promoted the Virginia Education Commission, created in 1910. Alderman's crusade encountered some resistance from traditionalists, and never challenged the Jim Crow system of segregated schooling.Michael Dennis, \\"Reforming the 'academical village,'\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1997, Vol. 105 Issue 1, pp. 53‚Äì86 Many Pre-Dreadnought and World War I-era warships were built at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, including the USS Virginia; the shipyard remains a major producer of American Naval vessels. While the progressives were modernizers, there was also a surge of interest in Virginia traditions and heritage, especially among the aristocratic First Families of Virginia (FFV). The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA), founded in Williamsburg in 1889, emphasized patriotism in the name of Virginia's 18th-century Founding Fathers.James M. Lindgren, \\"Virginia Needs Living Heroes\\": Historic Preservation in the Progressive Era,\\" Public Historian, Jan 1991, Vol. 13 Issue 1, pp. 9‚Äì24 In 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was held near Norfolk to celebrate the tricentennial of the arrival of the first English colonists and the founding of Jamestown. Attended by numerous federal dignitaries, and serving as the launch point for the Great White Fleet, the Jamestown Exposition also spurred interest in the military potential of the area. The site of the exposition would later become, in 1917, the location of the Norfolk Naval Station. The proximity to Washington, D.C., the moderate climate, and strategic location of a large harbor at the center of the Atlantic seaboard made Virginia a key location during World War I for new military installations. These included Fort Story, the Army Signal Corps station at Langley, Quantico Marine Base in Prince William County, Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Fort Lee near Petersburg and Fort Eustis, in Warwick County (now Newport News). At the same time, heavy shipping traffic made the area a target for U-boats, and a number of merchant vessels were attacked or sunk off the Virginia coast. Interwar Rapidan Camp served as Herbert Hoover's Presidential retreat (the predecessor to Camp David), in what would become Shenandoah National Park. Temperance became an issue in the early 20th century. In 1916, a statewide referendum passed to outlaw the consumption of alcohol. This was overturned in 1933.Arlington Connection, Michael Lee Pope, October 14‚Äì20, 2009, Alcohol as Budget Savior, page 3 After 1930, tourism began to grow with the development of Colonial Williamsburg. Shenandoah National Park was constructed from newly gathered land, as well as the Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive. The Civilian Conservation Corps played a major role in developing that National Park, as well as Pocahontas State Park. By 1940, new highway bridges crossed the lower Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James Rivers, bringing to an end the long-distance steamboat service which had long served as primary transportation throughout the Chesapeake Bay area. Ferryboats remain today in only a few places. =Byrd machine= Blacks comprised a third of the population but lost nearly all their political power. The electorate was so small that from 1905 to 1948 government employees and officeholders cast a third of the votes in state elections. This small, controllable electorate facilitated the formation of a powerful statewide political machine by Harry Byrd (1887‚Äì1966), which dominated from the 1920s to the 1960s.Morgan Kousser, The Shaping of Southern Politics (1974) p 181; Wallenstein, Cradle of America (2007) p 283‚Äì4 Most of the blacks who remained politically active supported the Byrd organization, which in turn protected their right to vote, making Virginia's race relations the most harmonious in the South before the 1950s, according to V.O. Key.V.O. Key, Jr., Southern Politics (1949) p 32 Not until Federal civil rights legislation was passed in 1964 and 1965 did African Americans recover the power to vote and the protection of other basic constitutional civil rights. WWII and Modern era Men practicing at Fort Story in 1942. The economic stimulus of the World War brought full employment for workers, high wages, and high profits for farmers.Joe Freitus, Virginia in the War Years, 1938-1945: Military Bases, the U-Boat War and Daily Life (McFarland, 2014) It brought in many thousands of soldiers and sailors for training. Virginia sent 300,000 men and 4,000 women to the services. The buildup for the war greatly increased the state's naval and industrial economic base, as did the growth of federal government jobs in Northern Virginia and adjacent Washington, DC. The Pentagon was built in Arlington as the largest office building in the world. Additional installations were added: in 1941, Fort A.P. Hill and Fort Pickett opened, and Fort Lee was reactivated. The Newport News shipyard expanded its labor force from 17,000 to 70,000 in 1943, while the Radford Arsenal had 22,000 workers making explosives. Turnover was very high‚Äîin one three-month period the Newport News shipyard hired 8400 new workers as 8,300 others quit.Charles Johnson, \\"V for Virginia: The Commonwealth Goes to War,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 100 (1992): 365‚Äì398 in JSTOR =Cold War and Space Age= A Little Joe rocket being prepared for launch at the Wallops Flight Facility near Chincoteague, as part of Project Mercury In addition to general postwar growth, the Cold War resulted in further growth in both Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. With the Pentagon already established in Arlington, the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency located its headquarters further afield at Langley (unrelated to the Air Force Base). In the early 1960s, the new Dulles International Airport was built, straddling the Fairfax County-Loudoun County border. Other sites in Northern Virginia included the listening station at Vint Hill. Due to the presence of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, in 1952 the Allied Command Atlantic of NATO was headquartered there, where it remained for the duration of the Cold War. Later in the 1950s and across the river, Newport News Shipbuilding would begin construction of the USS Enterprise‚Äîthe world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier‚Äîand the subsequent atomic carrier fleet. Virginia also witnessed American efforts in the Space Race. When the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was transformed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, the resulting Space Task Group headquartered at the laboratories of Langley Research Center. From there, it would initiate Project Mercury, and would remain the headquarters of the U.S. manned spaceflight program until its transfer to Houston in 1962. On the Eastern Shore, near Chincoteague, Wallops Flight Facility served as a rocket launch site, including the launch of Little Joe 2 on December 4, 1959, which sent a rhesus monkey, Sam, into suborbital spaceflight. Langley later oversaw the Viking program to Mars. The new U.S. Interstate highway system begun in the 1950s and the new Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1958 helped transform Virginia Beach from a tiny resort town into one of the state's largest cities by 1963, and spurring the growth of the Hampton Roads region linked by the Hampton Roads Beltway. In the western portion of the state, completion of north-south Interstate 81 brought better access and new businesses to dozens of counties over a distance of as well as facilitating travel by students at the many Shenandoah area colleges and universities. The creation of Smith Mountain Lake, Lake Anna, Claytor Lake, Lake Gaston, and Buggs Island Lake, by damming rivers, attracted many retirees and vacationers to those rural areas. As the century drew to a close, Virginia tobacco growing gradually declined due to health concerns, although not at steeply as in Southern Maryland. A state community college system brought affordable higher education within commuting distance of most Virginians, including those in remote, underserved localities. Other new institutions were founded, most notably George Mason University and Liberty University. Localities such as Danville and Martinsville suffered greatly as their manufacturing industries closed. = Civil rights era and Massive Resistance = In 1944, Irene Morgan refused to give up her seat on an interstate bus and was arrested in Middlesex County, Virginia pursuant to Virginia's segregation laws. Morgan appealed her case up to the U.S. Supreme Court and, in 1946, won Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, which struck down racial segregation in interstate buses. Virginia continued to enforce interstate bus segregation, and in 1947, activists organized a series of integrated rides, the Journey of Reconciliation, through Virginia and other states of the Upper South in an act of civil disobedience against Virginia's defiance of the Supreme Court's ruling. Another U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving Virginia, Boynton v. Virginia (1960), desegregated interstate bus terminals. Morgan, Boynton, and the Journey of Reconciliation inspired the 1961 Freedom Rides that fought bus segregation in the Deep South. Along with the bus desegregation cases, Virginia was a contestant in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage, Loving v. Virginia (1967). Senator Harry Byrd, the state's dominant politician, was long a champion of constitutional rights against expansion of federal power. He deployed two doctrines in a last ditch battle against racial integration after the Brown decision of 1954: interposition and massive resistance. The first doctrine proclaimed that the U.S. Constitution allowed the states to interpose state sovereignty blocking rulings of federal courts from taking effect on local school boards. The new doctrine of Massive Resistance became a rallying cry across the southern United States to block orders by federal courts to integrate public schools. The test cases came in Virginia, when in 1956 the legislature adopted interposition and urged fellow states to join in. Governor Stanley abandon his earlier moderation, and the legislature adopted the Stanley Plan. It included 13 segregationist laws, including five that were designed to intimidate the NAACP. The governor now had the power to close public schools, and he shut down the first one in Warren County in 1958, followed by Charlottesville and Norfolk. In 1959 both the Virginia supreme Court of Appeals, and the federal court declared the Stanley Plan unconstitutional in terms of both the state and federal constitutions. Governor J. Lindsay Almond broke with Byrd; the General assembly voted to end massive resistance. Nevertheless, in 1959-1963, Prince Edward County closed all its public schools.James H. Hershman Jr., \\"Massive Resistance\\" Encyclopedia of Virginia (2011) The first black students attended the University of Virginia School of Law in 1950, and Virginia Tech in 1953. In 2008, various actions of the Civil Rights Movement were commemorated by the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial in Richmond. Contemporary commonwealth Opening in 1976, the Washington Metro began to link Washington D.C. with the growing population centers in Northern Virginia By the 1980s, Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads region had achieved the greatest growth and prosperity, chiefly because of employment related to Federal government agencies and defense, as well as an increase in technology in Northern Virginia. Shipping through the Port of Hampton Roads began expansion which continued into the early 21st century as new container facilities were opened. Coal piers in Newport News and Norfolk had recorded major gains in export shipments by August 2008. The recent expansion of government programs in the areas near Washington has profoundly affected the economy of Northern Virginia whose population has experienced large growth and great ethnic/ cultural diversification, exemplified by communities such as Tysons Corner, Reston and dense, urban Arlington. The subsequent growth of defense projects has also generated a local information technology industry. In recent years, intolerably heavy commuter traffic and the urgent need for both road and rail transportation improvements have been a major issue in Northern Virginia. The Hampton Roads region has also experienced much growth, as have the western suburbs of Richmond in both Henrico and Chesterfield Counties. On January 13, 1990, Douglas Wilder became the first African American to be elected as Governor of a US state since Reconstruction when he was elected Governor of Virginia. Virginia served as a major center for information technology during the early days of the Internet and network communication. Internet and other communications companies clustered in the Dulles Corridor. By 1993, the Washington area had the largest amount of Internet backbone and the highest concentration of Internet service providers.Donnelly, Sally B. \\"D.C. Dotcom.\\" Time August 8, 2000. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,52073-2,00.html In 2000, more than half of all Internet traffic flowed along the Dulles Toll Road, and by 2016 70% of the world's internet traffic flowed through Loudoun County. Bill von Meister founded two Virginia companies that played major roles in the commercialization of the Internet: McLean, Virginia based The Source and Control Video Corporation, forerunner of America Online. While short-lived, The Source was one of the first online service providers alongside CompuServe. On hand for the launch of The Source, Isaac Asimov remarked \\"This is the beginning of the information age.\\" The Source helped pave the way for future online service providers including another Virginia company founded by von Meister, America Online (AOL). AOL became the largest provider of Internet access during the Dial-up era of Internet access. AOL maintained a Virginia headquarters until the then-struggling company moved in 2007. In 2006, former Governor of Virginia Mark Warner gave a speech and interview in the massively multiplayer online game Second Life, becoming the first politician to appear in a video game.LIFE: Mark Warner becomes first U.S. politician to campaign in a video game In 2007, Virginia speedily passed the nation's first spaceflight act by a vote of 99‚Äì0 in the House of Delegates.Virginia leads the way Northern Virginia company Space Adventures is currently the only company in the world offering space tourism. In 2008, Virginia became the first state to pass legislation on Internet safety, with mandatory educational courses for 11- to 16-year-olds.Virginia First State to Require Internet Safety Lessons Virginia was targeted in the September 11, 2001 attacks, as American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington County. In 2013, by a slight margin in the Virginia Governor's race, the state of Virginia broke a long acclaimed streak of choosing a governor against the incumbent party within the White House. For the first time in more than thirty years will the Governor and the President be from the same party.

Cammeray is part of the lower North Shore region of Northern Sydney. History Cammeray takes its name from the Cammeraygal people, an Aboriginal clan who once occupied the lower North Shore. Radiometric dating (carbon dating) indicates that indigenous peoples lived in the Cammeray area at least 5,800 years ago and Aboriginal shell middens have been discovered at Folly Point and cave paintings in Primrose Park. Prior to the 1920s, the suburb was known as Suspension Bridge reflecting the now Long Gully Bridge that joined Northbridge to Cammeray. Cammeray was slow to develop mainly due to its steep topography and remoteness from transport. Despite the land boom of the 1880s and plans for a suspension bridge across Flat Rock Creek, development in the Cammeray area was mostly confined to the south of the suburb with some boatmen‚Äüs houses on Folly Point. The rest of the district was very rural consisting of bushland, dairies and market gardens. Cammeray was also the site of Sydney's first quarry, with sandstone blocks from the quarry making many of the first buildings in Sydney town. An Australian politician and solicitor, Joseph Palmer Abbott, built Tarella, a two-storey Italianate mansion in Amherst Street, c. 1886, on land he had acquired in 1881. Palmer Street in Cammeray was named after him. Tarella includes a coachhouse at the rear, with a distinctive clock tower. It is listed with the Heritage Council of New South Wales. Long Gully Bridge In 1892, a suspension bridge was built as a private initiative by the North Sydney Investment and Tramway Company, to attract buyers for new residential allotments on the north side of Long Bay. In 1914, the first tram crossed the bridge, conveniently linking the new suburb and beautiful Middle Harbour peninsulas to the more developed parts of North Sydney. Land sales revived in 1909 when the tramway along Miller Street with a string of subdivisions opening up including the Bell‚Äüs Estate (1909). In the mid1930s faults were discovered in the bridge's steel cables and anchorages in the rock below so public transport was interrupted with passengers having to walk across the bridge as trams waited on either side. Estates established in the 1920s and 30s included the Morning Glow Estate (1921), Cammeray Estate (1932) and Green's Estate (1935). By the 1940s motor transport made the area more accessible and many waterfront houses were built. The last substantial subdivision in Cammeray was of the \\"Three Oaks Dairy‚Äü in 1942. It is recorded, however, that as late as 1958 dairy cattle still grazed at Cammeray. In the 1960s Cammeray‚Äüs residential progress was interrupted when the Warringah Expressway cut through most of the North Sydney including Cammeray. Portions of St Thomas‚Äü Cemetery and Cammeray Park were resumed, as well as numerous houses, particularly in the area between Falcon and Amherst Streets. The Warringah Expressway also divides Cammeray, with the only crossing points being at West, Miller, Ernest and Falcon Streets. Tarella Amherst Street was named after William Pitt Amherst, who was Governor-General of India 1823-28. Heritage listings include Tarella at 3 Amherst Street and the Cammeray Substation at 143 Bellevue Street. Demographics According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,006 residents in Cammeray. In Cammeray, 63.6% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 6.6%, New Zealand 2.8%, South Africa 1.7%, India 1.5% and China 1.4%. 78.6% of people only spoke English at home. The next most common language spoken at home was Mandarin at 1.7%. The most common responses for religion in Cammeray were No Religion 36.6%, Catholic 24.5% and Anglican 14.2%. Commercial area Miller Street is the main commercial thoroughfare of Cammeray with restaurants, cafes, the local post office, a petrol station and small businesses. Cammeray Square is a modern shopping and residential complex on Miller Street and adjacent to Green Park on Cammeray Road is a small business precinct giving the local area a village feel. Transport With close proximity to the Sydney CBD and the Warringah expressway Cammeray's location provides easy private and public access to all directions. Public transport is provided by bus with Cammeray being the last south-bound stop for services to the Sydney CBD via the Warringah Freeway. Buses to North Sydney, Milsons Point and Crows Nest are also available. Schools Cammeray has two public schools catering for students from Kindergarten to Year 6. Cammeray Public School is situated on the northern side of the suburb and Anzac Park Public School, that opened in 2016 , sits more to the south. Churches All Saints' Anglican church on Carter Street is the only church in Cammeray. It is part of the Naremburn Cammeray Anglican Church. Residential Cammeray has a mix of private and public apartments and dwellings with 75.8% medium and high density in 2016. 23.3% of all dwellings were separate houses; 35.5% were medium density dwellings and 40.2% were in high density dwellings, compared with 10.2%, 25.0%, and 64.2% in the North Sydney Council area respectively. Parks and recreation Tunks Park Cammeray offers a range of sports facilities and open spaces and the surrounding natural bushland and middle harbour provides for bushwalking and boating activities. Tunks Park is a large recreation and sporting area that is surrounded by bushland with middle harbour on the east. It provides open space, walking tracks, playground and picnic areas and has three sporting fields that are used for cricket during the summer and soccer and rugby during winter. It is a popular exercise and dog walking area with bushwalking tracks that lead towards Naremburn on the west and Northbridge on the north. A small public boat ramp allows small boats to enter Middle Harbour. Cammeray Park is a large green space that offers an all year round synthetic turf field for soccer and rugby. It is surrounded by private tennis courts, a skate park, a crocket field and a golf course. Green Park is an urban open grass area that is used for recreational activities and dog walking. It also has two public tennis courts and a child care centre. Anzac Park is a smaller open space that is mainly used for picnicking and dog walking and has a large community garden. The western area houses a grove of turpentine trees with plaques that surround North Sydney War Memorial that represent the Australian service women and men who participated in various theatres during World War II.

For example, a Totten trust arises when a bank account is titled in the form \\"[depositor], in trust for [beneficiary]\\". Origin The name is derived from Matter of Totten, 179 N.Y. 112 (1904), the case decided by the New York Court of Appeals which established the legality of this practice. Although this method of creating a trust did not meet the formal requirements of trust creation, or the testamentary formalities required to make a valid will, the Court noted that such an arrangement typically involved a small amount of money left by a person of modest means, who could not otherwise afford to establish a legal mechanism for passing the specified property. For this reason, the device is sometimes called a \\"poor man's will\\". The funds in question are not subject to probate and, if held in a bank account, are insured in the same manner as any deposit. The beneficiary has no access to the account until the depositor's death and need not be notified that the account exists. This is also called a tentative trust because it is contingent upon the death of the settlor or creator of the trust account. Totten trusts today Most U.S. states now recognize the validity of Totten trusts. The Restatement 3d of Trusts (Section 26) and the Restatement 3d of Property (Section 7.1 comment i) also recognize its validity. Such a device can be revoked at any time by the settlor, either by closing the account or by executing a will which disposes of the property in the account. The funds in the account can be reached by the creditors of the settlor during the settlor's life. If the intended beneficiary predeceases the settlor, then the gift will lapse, and will generally not be saved by an anti-lapse statute. A Totten Trust is classified as a \\"testamentary substitute\\" because it avoids the need for the assets held in the account to go through probate. Totten trusts can be created only with certain types of depository accounts or securities; in particular they can not be used to convey real property. More generally, Totten trusts are sometimes described as \\"Arrangements for deposit accounts.\\" See also *Purpose trust References Category:Property law Category:Personal finance Category:Banking in the United States ","title":"Totten trust"},{"id":"2164886","text":"Homological mirror symmetry is a mathematical conjecture made by Maxim Kontsevich. It seeks a systematic mathematical explanation for a phenomenon called mirror symmetry first observed by physicists studying string theory. History In an address to the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians in Z√ºrich, speculated that mirror symmetry for a pair of Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds X and Y could be explained as an equivalence of a triangulated category constructed from the algebraic geometry of X (the derived category of coherent sheaves on X) and another triangulated category constructed from the symplectic geometry of Y (the derived Fukaya category). Edward Witten originally described the topological twisting of the N=(2,2) supersymmetric field theory into what he called the A and B model topological string theories. These models concern maps from Riemann surfaces into a fixed target‚Äîusually a Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold. Most of the mathematical predictions of mirror symmetry are embedded in the physical equivalence of the A-model on Y with the B-model on its mirror X. When the Riemann surfaces have empty boundary, they represent the worldsheets of closed strings. To cover the case of open strings, one must introduce boundary conditions to preserve the supersymmetry. In the A-model, these boundary conditions come in the form of Lagrangian submanifolds of Y with some additional structure (often called a brane structure). In the B-model, the boundary conditions come in the form of holomorphic (or algebraic) submanifolds of X with holomorphic (or algebraic) vector bundles on them. These are the objects one uses to build the relevant categories. They are often called A and B branes respectively. Morphisms in the categories are given by the massless spectrum of open strings stretching between two branes. The closed string A and B models only capture the so- called topological sector‚Äîa small portion of the full string theory. Similarly, the branes in these models are only topological approximations to the full dynamical objects that are D-branes. Even so, the mathematics resulting from this small piece of string theory has been both deep and difficult. The School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton plans a special year devoted to Homological Mirror Symmetry during the 2016-17 academic year. Among the distinguished participants will be Paul Seidel from MIT, Maxim Kontsevich from IH√âS, and Denis Auroux, from UC Berkeley.IAS school of mathematics: Special Year on Homological Mirror Symmetry Examples Only in a few examples have mathematicians been able to verify the conjecture. In his seminal address, Kontsevich commented that the conjecture could be proved in the case of elliptic curves using theta functions. Following this route, Alexander Polishchuk and Eric Zaslow provided a proof of a version of the conjecture for elliptic curves. Kenji Fukaya was able to establish elements of the conjecture for abelian varieties. Later, Kontsevich and Yan Soibelman provided a proof of the majority of the conjecture for nonsingular torus bundles over affine manifolds using ideas from the SYZ conjecture. In 2003, Paul Seidel proved the conjecture in the case of the quartic surface. In 2002 explained SYZ conjecture in the context of Hitchin system and Langlands duality. Hodge diamond The dimensions hp,q of spaces of harmonic (p,q)-differential forms (equivalently, the cohomology, i.e., closed forms modulo exact forms) are conventionally arranged in a diamond shape called the Hodge Diamond. These (p,q)-betti numbers can be computed for complete intersections using a generating function described by Friedrich Hirzebruch. For a three-dimensional manifold, for example, the Hodge diamond has p and q ranging from 0 to 3: Mirror symmetry translates the dimension number of the (p, q)-th differential form hp,q for the original manifold into hn-p,q of that for the counter pair manifold. Namely, for any Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold the Hodge diamond is unchanged by a rotation by œÄ radians and the Hodge diamonds of mirror Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds are related by a rotation by œÄ/2 radians. In the case of an elliptic curve, which is viewed as a 1-dimensional Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold, the Hodge diamond is especially simple: it is the following figure. In the case of a K3 surface, which is viewed as 2-dimensional Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold, since the Betti numbers are {1, 0, 22, 0, 1}, their Hodge diamond is the following figure. In the 3-dimensional case, in usual called Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold, a very interesting thing happens. There are sometimes mirror pairs, say M and W, that have symmetric Hodge diamonds each other along diagonal straight line. M's diamond: W's diamond: M and W correspond to A- and B-model in string theory. Mirror symmetry does not only replace the homological dimensions but also symplectic structure and complex structure on the mirror pairs. That is the origin of homological mirror symmetry. In 1990-1991, had a major impact not only on enumerative algebraic geometry but on the whole mathematics and motivated . The mirror pair of two quintic threefolds in this paper have the following Hodge diamonds.

Its primary aim was the promotion of books to influence the thinking of the American people regarding World War II, to build and maintain the will to win, to expose the true nature of the enemy, to disseminate technical information, to provide relaxation and inspiration, and to clarify war aims and problems of peace. The Council co-operated with the Office of War Information (OWI) and other government agencies, but was itself a voluntary, unpaid, non-governmental organization. The Council attempted to achieve its goals by acting as a clearinghouse for book-related ideas, by being an intermediary between the book-trade industry and government agencies, by offering advice to publishers, and by handling all forms of public relations including distribution of reading lists and pamphlets, lectures, radio programs, newsreels, and book promotion and publication. In 1942, the Council created a War Book Panel to choose titles officially recommended by the Council. These titles were republished by Council member publishers with a seal of approval, a large \\"I\\" on the front cover meaning an \\"Imperative\\" book. Six \\"Imperative\\" books were published between 1942 and 1945 (see War Book Panel). In the spring of 1943, the Council launched the effort for which it would become best known, the Armed Services Editions. By the time the program ended in 1947, it had printed 122,951,031 books, selling them to the government at an average cost of just over six cents a volume. The Armed Services Editions brought high-end books to a mass audience, and helped popularize the emerging paperback format. One of the most popular ASE books was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1943) by Betty Smith, and the ASE's distribution of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby helped revive interest in the book. In 1944, the Council launched Oversees Editions, Inc, a subsidiary aimed at distributing American books to civilian populations abroad, to promote a positive view of American culture. With the end of World War II, the Council on Books in Wartime ceased active operations on Jan 31, 1946 but maintained its corporate entities to deal with the dispersal of remaining funds and the safekeeping of records. Some of those involved on the Council include: W. W. Norton of W. W. Norton & Company, Bennett Cerf of Random House, George A. Hecht of Doubleday & Co., and Mark Van Doren.

It is the flagship location for the larger Rush University System for Health, which includes Rush Oak Park Hospital and Rush Copley Medical Center, and serves as the primary teaching hospital in affiliation with Rush University. Services Rush University Medical Center provides 664 patient beds at its 14-story, 830,000-square-foot location on Chicago's Near West Side. The campus is known for its butterfly-shaped design both architecturally and strategically as its post-9/11 layout was intended to handle mass casualties. Rush offers more than 70 residency and fellowship programs in medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. Rush is also the largest non-governmental employer on Chicago's Near West Side with nearly 10,000 employees and annual spending of over $550 million.  History  Rush Medical College was chartered in on March 2, 1837, two days before the city of Chicago was chartered. The college opened with 22 students on December 4, 1843. It was the first health care institution in Chicago and one of the few medical schools west of the Alleghenies. Its founder, Daniel Brainard, named the school in honor of Benjamin Rush, the only physician with medical school training to sign the Declaration of Independence and who would later teach Meriwether Lewis basic medical skills for his expedition with William Clark to the Pacific Northwest. The general hospital associated with the medical college would be the first in Chicago. The early Rush faculty, well known across the American frontier for its expertise, engaged in patient care, research and teaching, and was associated with a number of scientific developments and new clinical procedures. As the city grew, so did Rush's involvement with other developing institutions: St. Luke's Hospital, established in 1864; Presbyterian Hospital, which was begun at the urging of the Rush faculty in 1883; and the University of Chicago, with which Rush Medical College was affiliated and later united from 1898 to 1942. In the early 1940s, Rush discontinued undergraduate education, but its library was maintained and its faculty continued to teach at the University of Illinois School of Medicine. In 1969, Rush Medical College reactivated its charter and merged with Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital, which itself had been formed through merger in 1956, to form Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. Rush University, which now includes colleges of medicine, nursing, health sciences and research training, was established in 1972. The Medical Center officially changed its name in September 2003 to Rush University Medical Center, to reflect the important role education and research play in its patient care mission.  Road Home Program  Rush University Medical Center established the Road Home Program in 2014. The program focuses on mental health treatment for veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and related illnesses. In 2015, the Road Home Program was selected as a founding partner of Warrior Care Network, along with UCLA Health Operation Mend, Massachusetts General Hospital Home Base, Emory Healthcare Veterans Program and Wounded Warrior Project. The Medical Center has a $620.3 million (2019) endowment.As of June 30, 2019. Rankings In 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranked Rush University Medical Center as No. 17 in the U.S., No. 2 in Illinois, No. 2 in Chicago metro area and one of the top hospitals in 11 different medical specialties nationally, including: *Neurology and neurosurgery (No. 4) *Orthopedics (No. 5) *Nephrology (No. 11) *Gynecology (No. 13) *Geriatrics (No. 14 [tie]) *Pulmonary care and lung surgery (No. 30) *Gastroenterology and GI surgery (No. 31) *Cardiology (No. 34) *Diabetes and endocrinology (No. 42) *Ear, nose and throat (No. 47) *Cancer (No. 48)  Awards  In 2020, U.S. News and World Report included Rush University Medical Center on its Best Hospitals Honor Roll, ranking Rush No. 17 nationally. In the same report, Rush ranked nationally in 11 adult specialties including No. 4 in Neurology & Neurosurgery and No. 5 in Orthopedics. All three Rush University System for Health hospitals earned the LGBTQ Healthcare Equality Leader designation from the Human Rights Campaign in 2020.. It was the second consecutive year that all three Rush hospitals received the designation and the twelfth time Rush University Medical Center had been designated an LGBTQ leader. In 2019, Vizient, Inc. ranked Rush University Medical Center first among 93 U.S. academic medical centers in its 2019 Quality and Accountability Study. It was the seventh consecutive time Rush was ranked among the top five in the annual study and the 11th time since the study began in 2005. The U.S. Department of Labor chose Rush University Medical Center to receive its 2007 Exemplary Voluntary Efforts (EVE) Award. The award recognizes federal contractors for exceptional efforts to increase employment opportunities for minorities, women, individuals with disabilities and veterans. Rush was one of only three organizations to receive the 2007 EVE award‚Äîalong with Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and the Public Service Enterprise Group, a Newark, New Jersey utility company‚Äîout of 17 employers nationwide that the Department of Labor invited to submit application proposals. Rush is the first Chicago-area organization to receive the award in more than a decade. Outreach In addition to its mission in patient care, education and research, Rush maintains a commitment to the community. Rush reaches out to the Chicago community through such offerings as the Rush Community Services Initiatives Program, an umbrella for several student-led outreach programs designed to address the social and health care needs of residents in neighboring communities. The Medical Center's community service efforts also include the Science and Math Excellence Network, a public-private partnership to improve the science and math skills of inner-city children through sponsorship of after-school science clubs, the construction of modern science labs in public elementary schools and other programs. The program serves nearly 50 elementary schools.

Her film career also included roles in Girls in Prison (1956), I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957), Blood Arrow (1958), Cattle Empire (1958), The Incredible Petrified World (1959), The Baby Maker (1970) and Goodnight, Sweet Marilyn (1989). =Television= In 1952, she guest-starred with Brad Johnson in \\"How Death Valley Got Its Name\\", the first episode of the anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. She appeared in the 1954 Death Valley Days episode \\"The Light On The Mountain\\". She was cast as the widowed Mary in the 1959 episode, \\"One in a Hundred.\\" In that episode, Michael Forest played cavalryman Larry Brooks, who is escorting pioneers across peaceful Indian country. The party runs into a lack of water as Brooks becomes attracted to Mary. In a 1964 episode, \\"The Left Hand Is Damned,\\" hosted by Ronald Reagan, she portrayed the kind-hearted saloon singer Dora Hand of Dodge City, Kansas. She was cast on The Lone Ranger in 1953, and then again on that popular series in 1955. Coates was cast in 1955 as Madge in the CBS sitcom Professional Father. In 1955, she portrayed Medora De More in the two-part episode \\"King of the Dakotas\\" of the NBC western anthology series Frontier. In 1956, she was cast in the episode \\"God in the Street\\" of another anthology series, Crossroads, based on the lives of American clergymen. That same year, she appeared in a second religious drama, This Is the Life, as Betty in the episode \\"I Killed Lieutenant Hartwell.\\" She was also cast in 1956 as Marge in the episode \\"Web Feet\\" of the military drama Navy Log. She guest-starred in David Janssen's crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective. In 1958, Coates played the mother, Clarissa Holliday, in all thirty-nine episodes of the 1958-1959 situation comedy, This Is Alice. She made guest appearances in three episodes of Perry Mason: \\"The Case of the Black-Eyed Blonde\\" in 1958, \\"The Case of the Cowardly Lion\\" in 1961, and in \\"The Case of the Ice-Cold Hands\\" in 1964. In 1961, she was cast as Elizabeth Gwynn in the episode \\"The Little Fishes\\" on CBS's Rawhide. Coates guest- starred as well on three episodes of Gunsmoke between 1958 and 1964. =Lois Lane= Coates played a strong-willed Lois Lane in the first twenty-six episodes of Adventures of Superman, in which she was given equal billing with George Reeves (insisted upon by Reeves), even for episodes in which she did not appear. Her powerful \\"damsel in distress\\" scream was used to good effect in several episodes. After shooting wrapped on the first season, the Superman producers suspended production until they found a national sponsor. When in 1953 it was possible to film more Superman episodes, Coates was already committed to another series. Noel Neill, who had played Lois Lane in two Columbia Superman serials, in 1948 and 1950, replaced Coates. With the death of Noel Neill on July 3, 2016, Coates became the last surviving regular cast member from the Adventures of Superman TV series. Coates's Superman fame has obscured the fact that she was one of Hollywood's most consistently employed actresses of the 1950s and '60s. She freelanced steadily, appearing in numerous low-budget features, many of them Westerns, as well as serials and a steady stream of TV appearances, both as a regular in several series and as a guest cast member in others. All this was in addition to the \\"McDoakes\\" shorts, in which she continued to appear until Warner Brothers discontinued the series in 1956. Arguably, her best-remembered films of the 1950s‚Äîperhaps owing to their being those in which she has a substantial role, and being among the few that have been preserved so that they are available today on home video‚Äîare Blues Busters with The Bowery Boys (in which she has a musical number); Panther Girl of the Kongo, a jungle serial in which she starred; and I Was a Teenage Frankenstein. =Later years= In the 1960s, when it became clear that Adventures of Superman would continue to enjoy great popularity in syndicated reruns, far beyond the end of its production in 1957, Coates‚Äîlike many of the other supporting cast members such as Jack Larson (\\"Jimmy Olsen\\")‚Äîtried to distance herself from the Superman series, fearing it might limit her opportunities. By the mid 1960s, however, she had settled into a comfortable semi-retirement as a wife and homemaker after marrying Los Angeles family physician Howard Press in 1962. She resumed her career after their divorce in 1986, but in the period immediately before that divorce, her film and television appearances were infrequent. One notable role was that of the mother of the female lead in the 1970 film The Baby Maker, directed by James Bridges, the lover and production partner of Jack Larson, who had remained Coates's good friend since they worked together on Adventures of Superman. Despite her stated misgivings about being remembered only as Lois Lane after relaunching her career, Coates agreed to appear as Lois's mother in the first season finale of the 1990s television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Noel Neill, who also played Lois Lane in film and TV series, had already been Lois's mother in the 1978 film Superman. Since then, it has become a tradition in Superman adaptations for actresses who have previously played Lois Lane to later play Lois's mother. Teri Hatcher, who played Lois in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, made an appearance in the tenth season of the series Smallville as Lois's mother, Ella Lane. Personal life Coates married director Richard L. Bare in 1948. They divorced in January 1949. She married jazz pianist Robert Nelms in 1950, gave birth to a daughter, and divorced in 1953. Coates married director Norman Tokar in 1955 and gave birth to a son in 1957. She was married to Dr. Howard Press from 1962 to 1986, during which time she gave birth to another daughter.

Uniform Transfers To Minors Act (UTMA) is a uniform act drafted and recommended by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1986, and subsequently enacted by most U.S. States, which provides a mechanism under which gifts can be made to a minor without requiring the presence of an appointed guardian for the minor, and which satisfies the Internal Revenue Service requirements for qualifying a gift of up to $14,000 for exclusion from the gift tax. It is a more flexible extension of the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), and allows the gifts to be real estate, inheritances, and other property. The Act allows the donor of the gift to transfer title to a custodian who will manage and invest the property until the minor reaches a certain age. The age is generally 21, but is different in some states (usually 18 in those cases).UGMA and UTMA Custodial Accounts In 2015 Florida passed a statute allowing the account to remain with the custodian until age 25 if desired. In the interim, the custodian can also make payments for the benefit of the minor out of the corpus of the gift. The donor can serve as a custodian, rather than transferring the property to someone else to hold for the minor. However, the value of custodianship property is included in a donor‚Äôs gross estate if the donor dies while serving as the custodian. Stuit v.

The home ground of the Eliteserien (2017) side Rosenborg BK, it has a capacity for 21,405 spectators, making it the second- largest football stadium in the country. Lerkendal opened as a multi-purpose stadium on 10 August 1947, as the main football and athletics stadium in Trondheim. Originally the venue was mostly used by the football teams SK Freidig and FK Kvik, and Rosenborg did not became a tenant until 1957. A new grandstand with roof was completed in 1962, and floodlights were installed in 1968. The oldest of the current stands were built in 1996, along with new lighting. Three more grandstands were built between 2000 and 2002, which also saw the removal of the athletics facilities and the sale of the stadium from Trondheim Municipality to Rosenborg. Further expansions plans have been launched, to increase capacity by filling in the corners and possibly by building a retractable roof. The record attendance of 28,569 dates from the decisive league match against Lillestr√∏m in 1985. Ten international matches were held at Lerkendal between 1951 and 1990. One domestic cup final has been held at Lerkendal; the Women's Cup Final in 1986. History The opening of the stadium on 10 August 1947 Construction of Lerkendal started as a public works during the 1930s, as a measure to create jobs. It opened on 10 August 1947, and consisted of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War. The first major rebuilding of the venue took place ahead of the 1962 season, when the wooden stands were torn and replaced with concrete stands on both long sides. On the south side, a wave-shaped roof was built; originally designed to be self-supporting, the contractor, Reinertsen, did not trust their own calculations and made a last-minute decision to install support columns. The new stands were taken into use on 3 May 1962. Floodlighting was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches to be held at the venue. An all-weather running track was subsequently also laid. On 1 December 1988, Lerkendal Station opened, allowing train passengers a short walk to the stadium. In 1994, the first pitch with Desso GrassMaster was laid. Exterior view of the Rema Stand (left) and EiendomsMegler1 Stand (right) By the time Rosenborg had qualified for the 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Champions League, UEFA had for security reasons introduced restrictions which reduced Lerkendal's capacity to 12,200 spectators. In addition, a total ban on standing places would be introduced from 1997. In 1995, a debate arose between Rosenborg and Trondheim Municipality regarding the construction of a new grandstand, to be located on the north side of the stadium. Rosenborg's Nils Skutle stated that if it was not built ahead of the 1997‚Äì98 season, Rosenborg would only be allowed to sell 2,800 tickets to their home Champions League matches, and that they instead would be forced to play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. The new grandstand cost 32 million, and opened in 1996 season. The upgrades also included a new floodlight and public announcement system. Rosenborg started laying plans for further construction, at first looking at construction of a new grandstand on the east end. In May 1998, Lerkendal Eiendom AS, owned 44% by Rosenborg, was established to build three new grandstands, including removing the running track to make it a football- only stadium. An alternative was to move and build an all-new stadium at Ranheim. Following the announcement of the Ranheim plans, Mayor Anne Kathrine Slung√•rd stated that she did not want to sell Lerkendal, as she wanted public ownership of cultural infrastructure. In April 1999, Trondheim Municipality's chief of administration, Knut S√¶ther, recommended that the municipality sell Lerkendal to Rosenborg, who would then along with private investors be free to construct the necessary facilities. At the time, the municipality estimated the value of Lerkendal to between NOK 50 and 100 million. The football district stated they were in favor of conversion of Lerkendal, and that they feared that if Rosenborg moved Lerkendal would incur high costs on the municipality, giving Gran√•sen as an example of a little used skiing facility which used half the municipal funding for sports venues. Lerkendal during a Rosenborg home UEFA Champions League match against Valencia in 2007 On 5 October 1999, the club and the municipality signed a letter of intent which indicated that the two would cooperate constructing a new venue along with private investors. The final contract was made with Reinertsen on 20 April 2000, and other involved investors included Fokus Bank, Gjensidige NOR, I. K. Lykke, Eiendomspar, Siemens and Trondheims N√¶ringsbygg. The club received a 47% share of the stadium company, while the municipality received 14% in exchange for the company taking over the ownership of the land and existing structure. As compensation for losing Lerkendal as an athletics venue, the municipality spent NOK 32 million upgrading √òya stadion as the city's new main athletics stadium. NOK 20 million was financed by Rosenborg, while the remainder was spent using public funds. Construction of the end stands started in January 2001, and they were completed in November. The demolition of the 1962 stand started on 24 October 2001, and the new stand was completed on 30 September 2002. The cost of constructing the new Lerkendal, including all four stands from 1996 to 2002, was NOK 335 million, of which NOK 253 million was for the 2001 and 2002 work. To give optimal conditions for the turf, the corners were not built out and the south stand was built with a transparent roof. However, the harsh climate forced the turf to be replaced two years later. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Lerkendal was found to be the league's second-best stadium, with a score of 4,40 on a scale from one to five. Facilities The EiendomsMegler1 Stand was built in 2002 Lerkendal Stadion consists of four, three-tier grandstand without corners. The stadium has a capacity for 21,405 spectators, of which 1,338 are in club seating and luxury boxes on the center tier of all four stands. The Hent Stand on the north side of the pitch, built in 1996, is the largest and the only to have red seats. It holds a capacity of 7,457 spectators. Originally named the Adidas Stand, it was renamed before the 2013-season. Opposite lies the EiendomsMegler1 Stand, which was completed in 2002. In addition to change rooms and an honor stand, it has a capacity for 6,194 spectators. The Rema Stand to the west, opened in 2001, houses the supporter shop, a pizza restaurant and commercial offices. The upper tier has since its opening been used as a family tier. While the lower tier was used by Kjernen, Rosenborg's singing supporters. Since Kjernen in 2009 moved to the upper tier of the opposite Adressa Stand, the whole Rema Stand has been used as a family stand. The Adressa Stand opened at the same time, and both have a seating capacity for 3,810 people. The latter hosts office space for Rosenborg Arena and the football district, as well as change rooms for the training pitch. The upper tier is used by Kjernen, Rosenborg's supporter club. The lower tier was earlier used by the away fans. But after Kjernen's move to the upper tier, the away fans was moved to the western end of the Hent stand. The pitch has Desso GrassMaster, a natural grass pitch with artificial fibers sown in for increase strength. This includes an automatic watering system and a built-in heating below the surface. The stadium is part of Lerkendal idrettspark, which also consists of three training pitches, two in full size and of which one has artificial turf. The main training pitch is the natural grass Skoglunden, while the artificial turf venue is Lerkendal kunstgress. The two pitches both have flood lighting, heating and are often used for matches by Rosenborg's recruit and reserve teams. The team has a health club located within the south stand. The club's offices are located in Brakka, a German- built barracks dating from World War II. The stadium is located at Lerkendal, south of the city center. It is located on the southern main road into town, with good bus service. In addition, it is located next to Lerkendal Station, the southern terminus of the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail. Parking near the stadium is very limited, and ad-hoc park and ride are established on matchdays at Stavset and City Syd. Events The Hent Stand was built in 1996 and is the oldest remaining part of the stadium. The venue was opened with a friendly football match between the Trondheim city team and the Vestfold county team, which Trondheim won 4‚Äì3. The opening, attended by 8,000 spectators, also saw several track and field events. The original main football tenants were SK Freidig and FK Kvik. The latter played in the Main League in 1951‚Äì52 and 1955‚Äì56, and otherwise remained in the Second Division throughout most of the 1950s and 60s. A record 18,000 spectators watched Freidig lose the 1948 Norwegian Football Cup semifinal against Viking. On 18 October 1950, Lerkendal hosted a friendly between Kvik and Spartak Moscow. Lerkendal hosted its first international on 26 June 1951, when Norway beat Iceland 3‚Äì1. On 28 August 1953 it hosted a B international game against Finland. Later national games consist of 5‚Äì0 against Malta on 3 July 1962, 2‚Äì0 against Finland on 20 August 1964, 4‚Äì2 against Luxembourg on 27 May 1965, with the record international audience of 22,319, 2‚Äì1 against Iceland on 21 July 1969, 0‚Äì1 against Denmark on 23 September 1973, 2‚Äì0 against West Germany on 26 September 1979, 1‚Äì0 against Wales on 6 June 1984, 1‚Äì0 against Bulgaria on 26 May 1987. and 1‚Äì2 against Denmark on 6 June 1990, The Football Association of Norway no longer plays international matches elsewhere than Ullevaal Stadion because of the conditions in its sponsorship agreements. On 26 May 1977, the Norway national under-21 football team lost 2‚Äì3 against Sweden at Lerkendal. Rosenborg took Lerkendal into use from the 1957‚Äì58 season, when they were promoted to the Regional League. The season ended in relegation and Rosenborg played the following season at their old home ground, Rosenborgbanen. With the promotion ahead of the 1959‚Äì60 season, Rosenborg returned to Lerkendal and have remained there since. In 1959, Lerkendal was the venue of a neutral quarter final in the cup between Nessegutten from Levanger and Viking, which attracted 25,043 spectators, mostly from Innherred, setting a new stadium record. From the 1960‚Äì61 season, Rosenborg established itself in the Main League. 27 September 1959 quarter final between Nessegutten and Viking, which attracted 25,043 spectators. The opening game of the new stands on 3 May 1962 was a Rosenborg friendly against Dunfermline Athletic. Freidig moved to Eberg idrettsanlegg when it was completed ahead of the 1965 season. A new stadium spectator record was set in the cup semifinal against Brann in 1967, which was watched by 25,551 people. Rosenborg qualified for the 1968‚Äì69 European Cup and met SK Rapid Wien in the first round. The game was spectated by 22,492 and remains the record for UEFA tournaments. Per-season average attendance for Rosenborg's league matches lay between five and ten thousand people during the 1970s and early 1980s, with an all-time low of 2,549 in 1978, when Rosenborg played in the Second Division. The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships four times, in 1963, 1967, 1973 and 1983. Lerkendal hosted the Women's Cup Final in 1986, where Sprint-Jel√∏y beat Trondheims-√òrn. Strindheim IL played in the top division in 1984 and 1995, both times playing their home games at Lerkendal. Kvik remained at Lerkendal until the upgrades started in 2000, after which they moved to √òya stadion. Bod√∏/Glimt played their home game in the 1999‚Äì2000 UEFA Cup against Werder Bremen at Lerkendal, attracting 1,425 spectators. The official all-time record at Lerkendal is the final game of the 1985 season, when Rosenborg won the league in the last game against Lillestr√∏m in a league final which attracted 28,569. Starting with Rosenborg's success in the late 1980s, attendance rose and lay between eleven and thirteen thousand until 2001. After the opening of the new stadium in 2002, attendance again rose, peaking at an average 19,903 in 2007, although it has fallen somewhat since. The high of most seasons is the 16 May game held every year: the 1994 edition against Troms√∏ saw 27,661 spectators, and in 1985 as many as 30,000 may have seen the game, as the gates were opened. Since the opening of the current stadium, the attendance record is 22,330, set in the 2006 edition against Odd Grenland. Between 1995 and 2007, Rosenborg played 11 seasons and 37 home matches in UEFA Champions League. The venue has been used for numerous concerts, including A-ha, Iron Maiden and Kiss.

To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for the roof of the Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row at the bottom of the four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian‚ÄìSwedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK 800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies. Rosenborg had originally planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, but this was canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced plans to build a retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. The roof was estimated to cost NOK 100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK 30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, with management stating that it would be necessary to complete the construction of all stands before a roof was built, and that they believed the stadium would soon be expanded. On 19 September 2014, Lerkendal was awarded the right to host the 2016 UEFA Super Cup, marking the first time a Norwegian stadium would host a European final.http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=2149721.html References External links *Chronology of aerial images * Lerkendal Stadion - Nordic Stadiums Category:Football venues in Norway Category:Eliteserien venues Category:Defunct athletics (track and field) venues in Norway Category:Sports venues completed in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in Norway Category:Sports venues in Trondheim Category:Rosenborg BK ","title":"Lerkendal Stadion"},{"id":"2164976","text":"Classic DPN mechanism: Molecular ink diffusing from a nanoscale tip to a surface through a water meniscus. Dip pen nanolithography (DPN) is a scanning probe lithography technique where an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip is used to create patterns directly on a range of substances with a variety of inks. A common example of this technique is exemplified by the use of alkane thiolates to imprint onto a gold surface. This technique allows surface patterning on scales of under 100 nanometers. DPN is the nanotechnology analog of the dip pen (also called the quill pen), where the tip of an atomic force microscope cantilever acts as a \\"pen,\\" which is coated with a chemical compound or mixture acting as an \\"ink,\\" and put in contact with a substrate, the \\"paper.\\" DPN enables direct deposition of nanoscale materials onto a substrate in a flexible manner. Recent advances have demonstrated massively parallel patterning using two-dimensional arrays of 55,000 tips. Applications of this technology currently range through chemistry, materials science, and the life sciences, and include such work as ultra high density biological nanoarrays, and additive photomask repair. Development The uncontrollable transfer of a molecular 'ink' from a coated AFM tip to a substrate was first reported by Jaschke and Butt in 1995, but they erroneously concluded that alkanethiols could not be transferred to gold substrates to form stable nanostructures. A research group at Northwestern University led by Chad Mirkin independently studied the process and determined that under the appropriate conditions, molecules could be transferred to a wide variety of surfaces to create stable chemically-adsorbed monolayers in a high resolution lithographic process they termed \\"DPN\\". Mirkin and his coworkers hold the patents on this process, and the patterning technique has expanded to include liquid \\"inks\\". It is important to note that \\"liquid inks\\" are governed by a very different deposition mechanism when compared to \\"molecular inks\\". Deposition materials = Molecular inks = Molecular inks are typically composed of small molecules that are coated onto a DPN tip and are delivered to the surface through a water meniscus. In order to coat the tips, one can either vapor coat the tip or dip the tips into a dilute solution containing the molecular ink. If one dip-coats the tips, the solvent must be removed prior to deposition. The deposition rate of a molecular ink is dependent on the diffusion rate of the molecule, which is different for each molecule. The size of the feature is controlled by the tip/surface dwell-time (ranging from milliseconds to seconds) and the size of the water meniscus, which is determined by the humidity conditions (assuming the tip's radius of curvature is much smaller than the meniscus). *Water meniscus mediated (exceptions do exist) *Nanoscale feature resolution (50 nm to 2000 nm) *No multiplexed depositions *Each molecular ink is limited to its corresponding substrate  Examples  *Alkane thiols written to gold *Silanes (solid phase) written to glass or silicon =Liquid inks= Liquid ink deposition mechanism Liquid inks can be any material that is liquid at deposition conditions. The liquid deposition properties are determined by the interactions between the liquid and the tip, the liquid and the surface, and the viscosity of the liquid itself. These interactions limit the minimum feature size of the liquid ink to about 1 micrometre, depending on the contact angle of the liquid. Higher viscosities offer greater control over feature size and are desirable. Unlike molecular inks, it is possible to perform multiplexed depositions using a carrier liquid. For example, using a viscous buffer, it is possible to directly deposit multiple proteins simultaneously. *1-10 micrometre feature resolution *Multiplexed depositions *Less restrictive ink/surface requirements *Direct deposition of high viscosity materials  Examples  *Protein, peptide, and DNA patterning *Hydrogels *Sol gels *Conductive inks *Lipids *Silanes (liquid phase) written to glass or silicon  Applications  In order to define a good DPN application, it is important to understand what DPN can do that other techniques can't. Direct-write techniques, like contact printing, can pattern multiple biological materials but it cannot create features with subcellular resolution. Many high-resolution lithography methods can pattern at sub-micrometre resolution, but these require high-cost equipment that were not designed for biomolecule deposition and cell culture. Microcontact printing can print biomolecules at ambient conditions, but it cannot pattern multiple materials with nanoscale registry. =Industrial applications= The following are some examples of how DPN is being applied to potential products. Cantilever biosensor functionalized with 4 different proteins # Biosensor Functionalization - Directly place multiple capture domains on a single biosensor device # Nanoscale Sensor Fabrication - Small, high-value sensors that can detect multiple targets # Nanoscale Protein Chips - High-density protein arrays with increased sensitivity =Emerging applications= Cell engineering DPN is emerging as a powerful research tool for manipulating cells at subcellular resolution * Stem cell differentiation * Subcellular drug delivery * Cell sorting * Surface gradients * Subcellular ECM protein patterns * Cell adhesion Rapid prototyping SEM image of DPN fabricated gold metastructure arrays. * Plasmonics and Metamaterials * Cell and tissue screening  DPN properties  =Direct write= DPN is a direct write technique so it can be used for top-down and bottom-up lithography applications. In top-down work, the tips are used to deliver an etch resist to a surface, which is followed by a standard etching process. In bottom-up applications, the material of interest is delivered directly to the surface via the tips. Gold on silicon metastructure fabricated with top-down DPN methods =Unique advantages= * Directed Placement - Directly print various materials onto existing nano and microstructures with nanoscale registry * Direct Write - Maskless creation of arbitrary patterns with feature resolutions from as small as 50 nm and as large as 10 micrometresMaskless lithography * Biocompatible - Subcellular to nanoscale resolution at ambient deposition conditions * Scalable - Force independent, allowing for parallel depositionsNature Chemistry Vol 1, August 2009 Thermal dip pen lithography A heated probe tip version of Dip Pen Lithography has also been demonstrated, thermal Dip Pen Lithography (tDPL), to deposit nanoparticles.Woo, Dai, King & Sheehan \\"Maskless Nanoscale Writing of Nanoparticle-Polymer Composites and Nanoparticle Assemblies using Thermal Nanoprobes\\" NanoLetters (2009) Semiconductor, magnetic, metallic, or optically active nanoparticles can be written to a substrate via this method. The particles are suspended in a PMMA or equivalent polymer matrix, and heated by the probe tip until they begin to flow. The probe tip acts as a nano-pen, and can pattern nanoparticles into a programmed structure. Depending on the size of the nanoparticles, resolutions of 78-400 nm were attained. An O2 plasma etch can be used to remove the PMMA matrix, and in the case of Iron Oxide nanoparticles, further reduce the resolution of lines to 10 nm. Advantages unique to tDPL are that it is a maskless additive process that can achieve very narrow resolutions, it can also easily write many types of nanoparticles without requiring special solution preparation techniques. However there are limitations to this method. The nanoparticles must be smaller than the radius of gyration of the polymer, in the case of PMMA this is about 6 nm. Additionally, as nanoparticles increase in size viscosity increases, slowing the process. For a pure polymer deposition speeds of 200 Œºm/s are achievable. Adding nanoparticles reduces speeds to 2 Œºm/s, but is still faster than regular Dip Pen Lithography. Beam pen lithography A two dimensional array of (PDMS) deformable transparent pyramid shaped tips are coated with an opaque layer of metal. The metal is then removed from the very tip of the pyramid, leaving an aperture for light to pass through. The array is then scanned across a surface and light is directed to the base of each pyramid via a micromirror array, which funnels the light toward the tip. Depending on the distance between the tips and the surface, light interacts with the surface in a near-field or far-field fashion, allowing sub-diffraction scale features (100 nm features with 400 nm light) or larger features to be fabricated. Common misconceptions =Direct comparisons to other techniques= Streptavidin (4 nm thickness) deposited using microcontact printing The criticism most often directed at DPN is the patterning speed. The reason for this has more to do with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses. For example, the soft lithography method, microcontact printing (ŒºCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to microcontact printing. The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to ŒºCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application. ŒºCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as photolithography can pattern over a large area in a single exposure. Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique. DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate. No one would try to apply microcontact printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern. Even if they did, microcontact printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry. The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and e-beam lithography. No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be \\"too slow\\". Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, e-beam lithography is slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world. The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by microcontact printing. =Connection to atomic force microscopy= DPN evolved directly from AFM so it is not a surprise that people often assume that any commercial AFM can perform DPN experiments. In fact, DPN does not require an AFM, and an AFM does not necessarily have real DPN capabilities. There is an excellent analogy with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron beam (E-beam) lithography. E-beam evolved directly from SEM technology and both use a focused electron beam, but it is not possible to perform modern E-beam lithography experiments on a SEM that lacks the proper lithography hardware and software components. It is also important to consider one of the unique characteristics of DPN, namely its force independence. With virtually all ink/substrate combinations, the same feature size will be patterned no matter how hard the tip is pressing down against the surface.Exceptions exist when printing to soft materials ‚Äì As long as robust SiN tips are used, there is no need for complicated feedback electronics, no need for lasers, no need for quad photo-diodes, and no need for an AFM.

In 1959, a meat-packing company from Livonia, Michigan called Hygrade Food Products owned and run by the Slotkin family, won a competition to be the exclusive supplier of hot dogs to the Tigers and Tiger Stadium. Hygrade employee Gus Hauff invented the recipe for the Ball Park Frank in 1958, which to this day remains a secret.

Life and career Larson was born on February 8, 1928California Birth Index, 1905‚Äì1995. Sacramento, CA, USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics. in Los Angeles, the son of Anita (Calicoff), a Western Union clerk, and George Larson, a milk truck driver. His father was of English and Swedish descent and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Russia). He was reared in Pasadena. He graduated from Montebello High School in 1945, aged 17 and at times claimed 1933 as his birth year. Larson found the role of cub reporter Jimmy Olsen on The Adventures of Superman to be a handicap, because he became typecast as a naive young man. This caused him to do little acting after the show ended in 1958, and he turned to writing and production, with an output that included plays, a libretto, texts for classical music, and movies such as The Baby Maker. In later years his attitude towards the Jimmy Olsen role warmed, as he focused more on the love people had for the character. Larson was always willing to sit for interviews about the Superman series and his connection to it, and began having a number of cameos that paid subtle tribute to his character and the series, including a 1991 episode of the TV series Superboy, alongside Noel Neill, who played Lois Lane in Adventures of Superman, and an episode of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman as an aged Jimmy Olsen in the episode \\"Brutal Youth\\", first broadcast on October 20, 1996. Larson had a cameo in a late-1990s American Express card commercial, The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman. He and Neill provided commentary on several Adventures of Superman episodes for the January 2006 DVD release of the 1953 season, and in 2006, he appeared in Bryan Singer's film Superman Returns in a cameo role as \\"Bo the Bartender\\". Bo wore a bowtie, a trademark of Larson's depiction of Jimmy Olsen. Larson and Neill appeared together at the premiere of Superman Returns. Larson's last television appearance was in the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Quickie\\", which aired on the NBC network on January 6, 2010. Larson was interviewed extensively for the movie Making Montgomery Clift in which he verified Clift's nephew's (Rob Clift, Director) claim that Clift was not a dark tragically depressed figure, but someone who loved life and the people who loved him in return. Among his other work, Larson wrote the libretto to the opera Lord Byron to music by Virgil Thomson. Personal life Larson was the life partner of director James Bridges from 1958 until Bridges' death on June 6, 1993. Prior to that, he was the companion of actor Montgomery Clift. Larson owned and resided in the Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äìdesigned George Sturges House in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, California, until his death. He died on September 20, 2015, at the age of 87. His interment was at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.Wilson, Scott.

Hirsch is a graduate of The Putney School in Vermont and Hampshire College, in Amherst, Massachusetts. He wrote and directed the documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony. Hirsch also contributed a chapter to Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture (The MIT Press, 2008), edited by Paul D. Miller (DJ Spooky). His film Bully premiered at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival. Bully follows several families from across ethnic, cultural and geographic boundaries as they grapple with the tragedy their family has faced as a result of bullying. Several of the families profiled in the film had lost a child because he or she became fed up with the mostly mental and sometimes physical abuse they experienced on a daily, even hourly basis at school, on the school bus, and in their communities. In a screening of Bully in Minneapolis in September 2011, director Hirsch told the audience during the post-film Q & A that he himself had been bullied, and that was part of the inspiration for the film, and for the direction he took it. In an interview with Twin Cities Jewish news website TC Jewfolk after the screening Hirsch continued: \\"I felt that the hardest part of being bullied was communicating,\\" Hirsch said. \\"And getting help. I couldn‚Äôt enroll people's support. People would say things like 'get over it,' even my own father and mother. They weren‚Äôt with me. That was a big part of my wanting to make the film.

Description Zebrasoma desjardinii grows to a maximum length of 40 cm (16 in), with sexual dimorphism producing males that are larger than females. This species shows the typical morphology of the family Acanthuridae. The body is oval or disc- shaped, with erectile and much elevated dorsal and anal fins. The coloration may vary from one individual to another and within the same individual, depending on age. In general, the upper side of the body alternates orange and dark blue vertical bands, with a larger blue band on the eyes, a spotted ventral region and numerous white spots on the head. The dorsal and anal fins have a pattern of horizontal alternate orange and blue bands. The caudal fin shows white spots and lines. Like most surgeonfish on each side of the caudal fin, in the middle of the caudal peduncle, there is a defensive dark spine surrounded by a blue zone. This spine is hinged and may unfold to 80¬∞. In comparison to Zebrasoma veliferum, the adult Red Sea sailfin tang has fewer anal fin rays (22-24 instead of 23-26) and different markings on the tail. As a juvenile, the two species are almost indistinguishable in color and markings. Zebrasoma desjardinii displaying its soft dorsal and anal fins Behavior Adults usually can be found in pairs, while juveniles are solitary. When threatened, these fishes display their large ventral and dorsal fins. They feed primarily on filamentous algae, various macroalgae and plankton. However, individuals were regularly observed feeding on jellyfish (Scyphozoa) and comb jellies (Ctenophora) in the Red Sea. They are pair spawners, a typical trait of other fish in the genus Zebrasoma. This differs from the group spawning typical of the family Acanthuridae. Distribution This species is widespread in the Indian Ocean from the northern Red Sea to KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa and as far east as India and Java. Habitat Red Sea sailfin tangs natively live in lagoons and reefs in a tropical climate. The juvenile fishes live in the inner reef areas. They prefer saltwater with a specific gravity of 1.020 - 1.025, a pH between 8.1 and 8.4 and an ideal temperature range of 22 - 26 C (72 - 78 F). They may live at water depths of 2 ‚Äì 30 m (6.5 ‚Äì 100 ft) or more. Bibliography * Sprung, Julian y Delbeek, J.Charles. - The Reef Aquarium.

He was best known for portraying Inspector Bill Henderson in the American television series Adventures of Superman. Early years Shayne was born in Yonkers, New York. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Grosvenor Dawe, and he had a brother, Allen Shaen Dawe. His father was one of the founders of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Shayne left Boston University in his senior year so that his brother could go to college. For a time, he lived in Birmingham, Alabama, writing advertising copy for a women's clothing store by day and acting in a stock theater company at night. When the store went out of business, he began acting full-time. Career Shayne became an actor after having worked as a reporter at the Illustrated Daily Tab in Miami, Florida. His initial acting experience came with repertory companies in Alabama, including the Birmingham Players. = Stage = Shayne's first Broadway appearance came by 1931 in The Rap. His other Broadway shows include Yellow Jack (1934), The Cat and the Canary (1935), Whiteoaks (1938), with Ethel Barrymore, and Without Love (1942), with Katharine Hepburn. = Film = From Indestructible Man (1956), L-R: Lon Chaney, Jr., Joe Flynn, and Robert Shayne Shayne began his film career in 1934, appearing in two features. In 1942, he became a contract actor with Warner Bros.. He played many character roles in movies and television, including a film series of Warner Bros. featurettes called the \\"Santa Fe Trail\\" series such as Wagon Wheels West, and as a mad scientist in the 1953 horror film The Neanderthal Man. He appears briefly in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, seated at a booth in a hotel bar, where his character meets Cary Grant's character, just as the latter is about to be kidnapped. He also had a small but pivotal role in the 1953 sci-fi classic Invaders From Mars as a scientist. Shayne enjoyed a brief rebirth in his career when he was cast as the blind newspaper vendor in The Flash television show; he was by this time actually blind and learned his lines by having his wife read them to him and then rehearse until he memorized them. = Television = Shayne portrayed Police Inspector William \\"Bill\\" Henderson on the 1950s TV series Adventures of Superman. He appeared sporadically in the early episodes of the series, in part because he was accused by his second wife Mary Sheffield, and came under HUAC scrutiny and was briefly blacklisted on unproven and unspecific charges of association with Communism. As the program evolved, especially in the color episodes, he was brought into more and more of them, to the point where he was a regular on the series.  Personal life  Shayne married Mary Crouch in 1929.see the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, NY 12/19/1925, page 7 They divorced three years later and had one daughter. In 1934, he married Mary Sheffield. They divorced in 1946 and had one daughter.  Death  Shayne died of lung cancer at the Motion Picture Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, California, and was survived by his wife, 3 daughters, 11 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren.

Security paper of the Compagnie G√©n√©rale A√©ropostale, issued 5. November 1928 A√©ropostale (formally, Compagnie g√©n√©rale a√©ropostale) was a pioneering aviation company which operated from 1918 to 1933. It was founded in 1918 in Toulouse, France, as Soci√©t√© des lignes Lat√©co√®re, also known as Lignes aeriennes Lat√©co√®re or simply \\"The Line\\" (La ligne).  History  A√©ropostale monument in Tarfaya. A√©ropostale founder Pierre-Georges Lat√©co√®re envisioned an air route connecting France to the French colonies in Africa and South America. The company's activities were to specialise in, but were by no means restricted to, airborne postal services. Between 1921 and 1927 the \\"Line\\" operated as Compagnie g√©n√©rale d'entreprises a√©ronautiques (CGEA). In April 1927 Lat√©co√®re, having troubles with its planes, damaged due to long flights to South America, decided to sell 93% of his business to another Brazilian-based French businessman named Marcel Bouilloux-Lafont. On that basis Bouilloux-Lafont then founded the Compagnie g√©n√©rale a√©ropostale, better known by the shorter name A√©ropostale. On December 25, 1918, the company began serving its first route between Toulouse and Barcelona in Spain. In February 1919 the line was extended to Casablanca. By 1925 it extended to Dakar, where the mail was shipped by steamer to South America. In November 1927 regular flights between Rio de Janeiro and Natal were started.Franix-Reichel. Une victoire de l'aviation fran√ßaise, Paris: Le Figaro, 17 June 1928, p. 5. Retrieved from the Gallica.bnf.fr website. Expansion then continued to Paraguay and in July 1929 a regularly scheduled route across the Andes Mountains to Santiago, Chile, was started, later extending down to Tierra del Fuego on the southern part of Chile. Finally, on May 12‚Äì13, 1930, the trip across the South Atlantic by air finally took place: a Lat√©co√®re 28 mail plane fitted with floats and a Hispano-Suiza engine made the first nonstop flight. Aeropostale pilot Jean Mermoz flew from Dakar to Natal in 19 hours, 35 minutes, with his plane holding of mail. After a scandalL'affaire de l'A√©ropostale (The l'A√©ropostale Scandal), 1931-1932. - 16 signed caricatures by 'Dukercy', and 62 press photographs in which postal payments from the French government were misused by Aeropostale, the company was dissolved in 1932 and merged with a number of other aviation companies (Air Orient, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Transport A√©rien, Air Union, and Compagnie Internationale de Navigation) to create Air France.  A√©ropostale pilots  Developed in the aftermath of World War I, air mail service owed much to the bravery of its earliest pilots. During the 1920s, every flight was a dangerous adventure, and sometimes fatal. The period was eloquently described by the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry ‚Äì himself an A√©ropostale pilot ‚Äì in his novel Vol de Nuit (\\"Night Flight\\"), in which he describes a postal flight through the skies of South America. A√©ropostale's roster of pilots included such aviation legends as: * Jean Mermoz * Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry * Henri Guillaumet * Marcel Reine * Emile L√©crivain * Pierre Deley * Henri Larrieu (1893 ‚Äì 1974) * Raymond Vanier  Aircraft  Among the aircraft operated by the company were: * Bl√©riot 5190 * One hundred Breguet 14s * Farman F.70, for passenger and mail routes between Casablanca and Dakar and also from Algiers to Biskra. * Lat√©co√®re 26 * Lat√©co√®re 28  Film  * Night Flight (1933 film), a 1933 film starring Clark Gable, was based on the novel by Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, which recounted his real life experiences when he managed and flew for the Aeroposta Argentina subsidiary in South America.Hanson & Gevinson 1993, Vol. 3. In the movie the airline was given the fictitious name Trans- Andean European Air Mail. * In 1995, Futuroscope paid homage to A√©ropostale pilot Henri Guillaumet with a 3D IMAX film by Jean-Jacques Annaud, in Wings of Courage (les Ailes du Courage), chronicling the pilot's crash on the frozen lake surface of Laguna del Diamante in the Andes, while flying mail for the South American subsidiary, Aeroposta Argentina.James, Caryn.

First responders in Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia have recently begun using the ERG as well. It is produced by the United States Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico). The principal authors of the ERG are Transport Canada's Michel Cloutier and U.S. DOT's George Cushmac.http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Hazmat/ERG2016.pdf  Guidebook Contents  The ERG is primarily applicable for hazardous materials transported by highway and railway, but also is applicable for materials transported by air or waterway, as well as by pipeline. It was first issued by the US Department of Transportation in 1973, but later became a joint publication of the Department of Transportation (US DOT), Transport Canada (TC), and the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) of Mexico, with collaboration with the Chemistry Information Center for Emergencies (CIQUIME) of Argentina. The ERG is issued every 4 years, with editions now being published in Spanish (Gu√≠a de Respuesta en Caso de Emergencia). In 1996 it was published as the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, but by the next publication in 2000 \\"North American\\" was removed due to its use by several South American countries).

It is divided into six color-coded sections (white [uncolored], yellow, blue, orange, green, and a second white [uncolored]). The ERG includes 62 \\"Guides\\" (found in the Orange Section) that identify the primary hazards associated with the applicable general category of hazardous material and general guidance on how to respond to incidents involving that general category of hazardous material. The primary purpose of ERG is to direct the emergency responders to the most appropriate of these guides, based on the incident. The ERG also provides guidance regarding recommended evacuation distances, if applicable, in the Green Section.  Sections = White Section (front) = The first section, with white page (uncolored) borders, provides the following: *Information regarding shipping documents *Instructions on how to use the guidebook *General guidance for responding to any hazardous material incident *Basic information on the hazard classification system and the associated placards/labels *Recommendations the proper guides based transporting vehicle types and/or placards (when the material in question cannot be further identified otherwise) *General safety precautions *Specific guidance for incidents involving pipelines = Yellow Section = The second section, with yellow page borders, references the material in order of its assigned 4-digit ID number/UN/NA number (which is often placarded with the other hazardous materials placards) and identifies the appropriate guide number to reference in the Orange Section). Items highlighted in green in this section will have evacuation distances included in the Green Section. = Blue Section = The third section, with blue page borders, references the material in alphabetical order of its name and identifies the appropriate guide number to reference in the Orange Section). Items highlighted in green in this section will also have evacuation distances included in the Green Section. = Orange Section = The fourth section, with orange page borders, includes the actual response guides. Each of the 62 guides provides safety recommendations and directions on how to proceed during the initial response phase (first thirty minutes) of the incident. It includes \\"health\\" and \\"fire or explosion\\" potential hazard information (with the more dangerous hazard listed first). For example, \\"the material gives off irritating vapors, easily ignited by heat, reactive with water\\"; \\"highly toxic, may be fatal if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through skin\\"; etc. Next this section includes information for responders on appropriate protective clothing and possible evacuation information for either spill or fire is given. It also includes information on fighting fires (example, do not apply water to sodium), warnings for spills or leaks, and special directions for first aid (example, not to give mouth-to- mouth resuscitation if the materials are toxic). In the event of an unknown material, Guide #111 should be followed until more information becomes available. = Green Section = The fifth section, with green page borders, suggests initial evacuation or shelter in place distances (protective action distances) for spills of materials that are Toxic-by-Inhalation (TIH). These distances vary based on the size of the spill (small or large) and whether the incident occurs during the day or at night. Only materials that were highlighted in green in the Yellow and Blue Sections are included in the Green Section. This section also includes information regarding toxic gases that are produced when certain materials are spilled in water (as identified previously in this section). Finally, this section includes some very specific evacuation details for six common materials. = White Section (back) = The sixth section, with white page (uncolored) borders, provides the following: *Additional instructions on how to use the guidebook *Information regarding protective clothing and equipment *Instructions on fire and spill control *BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion) safety precautions *Beginning with the 2004 edition, information specifically for hazardous materials being used for terrorism *Glossary of terms used in the ERG *Contact information for the various countries  See also  * Dangerous goods * Emergency management * Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders References External links Editions of the ERG: * 2020 Edition - Current Edition - (Archived) * 2016 Edition - (Archived) * 2012 Edition - (Archived) * 2008 Edition - (Archived) * 2004 Edition - (Archived) * 2000 Edition - At Internet Archive * 1996 Edition - At Internet Archive Other links * - The United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration * - Transport Canada webpage *Press release announcing 2016 edition ERG release Category:1973 non-fiction books Category:1996 non-fiction books Category:2000 non-fiction books Category:2004 non-fiction books Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:2012 books Category:Handbooks and manuals Category:Firefighting Category:Emergency management Category:Firefighting in the United States Category:Hazardous materials ","title":"Emergency Response Guidebook"},{"id":"2165098","text":"Caramelos de Cianuro (Cyanide Candies) is an alternative rock band from Venezuela formed in 1991. They recorded their first songs, \\"Nadando a Trav√©s De la Galaxia\\" (Swimming Across the Galaxy) and \\"Tu Mam√° Te Va a Pegar\\" (Your mom is going to hit you), in 1992. Career A year later, the group signed up to CNR and released an EP called Las Paticas de la Abuela, followed by the band's first album, Cuentos Para Adultos, in 1994. Performing a mixture of Latin Punk and alternative rock, Caramelos de Cianuro returned in 1996 with Harakiri City, released by Polygram. Two years later, original drummer Pablo Mart√≠nez was replaced by Alfonso Tosta, and the group went on tour with Colombian band Aterciopelados. In 2000 they released their album Miss Mujerzuela, which achieved platinum status in Venezuela in 2001. In 2002, Caramelos de Cianuro released their album called Frisbee, which featured \\"El √öltimo Polvo\\". This song's video got into MTV Latin America's Top Ten. In 2005, Luis Golding left the band and P√°vel Tello joined the band's line up shortly afterward. In 2006 they released their album, Flor De Fuego, with \\"Como Serpiente\\" promoted as the lead off single. In August 2008, Alfonso Tosta left the band and was replaced by Dar√≠o Adames. In 2010 the group released the album Caramelos de Cianuro, and in 2015 the band released their last album 8 with more of a soft rock and post punk sound, with \\"Secreto\\" as first single. On March 22, 2012, their manager and friend of 10 years, Libero Iaizzo, was kidnapped in Caracas, Venezuela while Caramelos de Cianuro were in Mexico preparing for a concert. Though the ransom demand was met, Iaizzo was killed the next day with a shot to the head. That year's Pepsi Music Awards ceremony, at which Caramelos de Cianuro were named Refreshing Band and Rock Artist of the Year, included a tribute to Iaizzo.

It was first published in Italian in 2004, and an English language translation by Geoffrey Brock was published in spring 2005. The title is taken from the title of an Italian edition album of an episode of the American comic strip Tim Tyler's Luck. Plot The plot of the book concerns Yambo (full name: Giambattista Bodoni, just like the typographer Giambattista Bodoni), a 59-year-old Milanese antiquarian book dealer who loses his episodic memory due to a stroke. At the beginning of the novel, he can remember everything he has ever read but does not remember his family, his past, or even his own name. Yambo decides to go to Solara, his childhood home, parts of which he has abandoned following a family tragedy, to see if he can rediscover his lost past. After days of searching through old newspapers, vinyl records, books, magazines and childhood comic books, he is unsuccessful in regaining memories, though he relives the story of his generation and the society in which his dead parents and grandfather lived. Ready to abandon his quest, he discovers a copy of the original First Folio of 1623 among his grandfather's books, the shock of which causes another incident, during which he relives his lost memories of childhood. The final section of the book is, therefore, a literary exploration of the traditional phenomenon whereby a person's life flashes before him or her, as Yambo struggles to regain the one memory he seeks above all others: the face of the girl he loved ever since he was a student. Umberto Eco includes myriad references to both scholarly and popular culture in the book (notably the Flash Gordon strips) and has drawn heavily on his own experiences growing up in Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy. Like other Eco novels, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana boasts abundant intertextuality. Critical reception The novel received generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0‚Äì100 reviews from professional reviewers, the book achieved a rating score of 65 based on 23 reviews.

He has since produced songs for artists such as Trey Songz, Ne-Yo, and Big Boi. In 2017, Luke began songwriting and producing for German singer- songwriter Kim Petras. He also produced five songs on Doja Cat's second album Hot Pink (2019), including its number one single \\"Say So\\". Lawsuit with Kesha In September 2013, Rebecca Pimmel, a fan of Kesha, set up a petition to \\"free\\" Kesha from Gottwald's management and accused Luke of \\"stunting\\" Kesha's creative growth as an artist. The petitioners concur with the position stated in Kesha's TV series documentary, My Crazy Beautiful Life, in which Luke serves as an executive producer, that she had little creative control of her second album, Warrior. In January 2014, shortly after Kesha was admitted to a rehab center for bulimia nervosa, Kesha's mother, Pebe Sebert, made allegations that pressure for Kesha to lose weight came from Gottwald. Sebert claimed that Gottwald said that Kesha looked \\"like a refrigerator\\" which instigated her eating disorder. Gottwald denies these claims. In October 2014, Kesha sued Gottwald, claiming sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, gender violence, civil harassment, violation of California's laws against unfair business practices, infliction of emotional distress (both intentional and negligent), and negligent retention and supervision. Gottwald responded by filing a countersuit alleging that Kesha's lawsuit was an attempt by Kesha, her mother, and her new management firm to extort him into releasing her from her contract. A preliminary injunction in which Kesha sought to be released from her contract was denied on February 19, 2016. Before her legal battle against Gottwald, in 2011, Kesha had previously sworn under oath that the producer had never assaulted or drugged her in a deposition for a lawsuit against her former managers at DAS Communications, a key piece of evidence that played a role in the court ruling in favor of the defense. In April 2016, Kesha claimed that she had been offered freedom from her contract if she recanted her rape allegations against Gottwald. Since Gottwald's countersuit was in New York, the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on incidents alleged to have occurred in California. Kesha filed suit in California, but a Los Angeles superior court judge froze Kesha's lawsuit until Gottwald's lawsuit, for breach of contract and defamation, was settled. On April 6, 2016, New York Judge Shirley Kornreich dismissed Kesha's claims of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and gender violence. \\"While Kesha's [claim] alleges that she was sexually, physically and verbally abused by Gottwald for a decade, she describes only two specific instances of physical/sexual abuse,\\" Kornreich wrote. \\"And the most recent event described was alleged to have happened in 2008 and so falls outside of the statute of limitations.\\" The judge dismissed Kesha's hate crime claim because the filings \\"do not allege that Gottwald harbored animus toward women or was motivated by gender animus when he allegedly behaved violently toward Kesha ... Every rape is not a gender- motivated hate crime.\\" Kesha's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress was dismissed by the judge because \\"claims of insults about her value as an artist, her looks, and her weight are insufficient to constitute extreme, outrageous conduct intolerable in civilized society.\\" Awards and nominations Grammy Awards *2011 ‚Äì Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (Nominated) *2011 ‚Äì Album of the Year (Teenage Dream) (Nominated) *2014 ‚Äì Song of the Year (\\"Roar\\") (Nominated) *2014 ‚Äì Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (Nominated) ASCAP Pop Music Awards *2010 ‚Äì Songwriter of the Year (Won) *2011 ‚Äì Songwriter of the Year (Won) Discography  References   External links  * *Dr. Luke Discography Category:1973 births Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American singers Category:21st- century American guitarists Category:21st-century American singers Category:American male guitarists Category:American male pop singers Category:American pop singers Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:American pop guitarists Category:American synth-pop musicians Category:Guitarists from New York City Category:Guitarists from Rhode Island Category:Jewish American songwriters Category:Jewish singers Category:Living people Category:Manhattan School of Music alumni Category:Musicians from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Record producers from New York (state) Category:Record producers from Rhode Island Category:Remixers Category:Saturday Night Live Band members Category:Singers from New York City Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:Songwriters from Rhode Island Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Dr. Luke"},{"id":"2165112","text":"Generalgouvernement is a German term that may refer to: *General Government of Belgium under German occupation during World War I *General Government, German-occupied Poland during World War II ","title":"Generalgouvernement"},{"id":"2165120","title":"Aterciopelados"},{"id":"2165132","text":"·∏§ƒÅrith ibn Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib () was one of the uncles of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

The Life of Muhammad. London & New York: Routledge. Opposition to Islam In their youth, Abu Sufyan and Muhammad were close friends; but as soon as Muhammad declared himself a prophet in 610, Abu Sufyan ‚Äútreated him with enmity as no one before him.\\" As he later explained it: \\"We were with a community, a people of high-mindedness. I saw the excellence of the people who lived with their discernment and opinion. They went through a mountain pass, and we followed. Then the people of nobility and age began to break away from Muhammad, and they helped their gods and defended their forefathers, and we followed them.\\" \\"He showed hatred toward the Prophet for twenty years, never remaining behind when the Quraysh set out to fight Muhammad.\\" He fought at the Battle of Badr on the side of the polytheists. He was one of the first to arrive back in Mecca with the news of their defeat. As he told his uncle, Abu Lahab: \\"As soon as we met the party we turned our backs and they were killing and capturing us just as they pleased; and by God I don't blame the people for that. We met men in white on piebald horses between heaven and earth, and, by Allah, they spared nothing, and none could withstand them.\\"Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. He also wrote satirical poems against Muhammad and the Muslims and insulted Hassan ibn Sabit: Who will deliver a message to Hassan from me? I think you are one of the most evil of destitute men. Your father is the father of evil, and your uncle is the same. You are not better than your father and your uncle. Hassan asked Muhammad's permission to compose counter-insults, promising to withdraw Muhammad's own name from the hostile sentiments, and permission was given. In January 626 Muhammad led the final expedition to Badr, an appointment for a pitched battle between the Quraysh and the Muslims. The battle did not take place because the Meccan army never arrived. Hassan ibn Thabit composed a poem about the situation: We stayed by the shallow well eight nights ‚Ä¶ Take Abu Sufyan [ibn Harb] a message from me, for you are the best of a bad lot. Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith composed an answer: O Hassan, son of a moldy date-eating woman, ‚Ä¶ you stayed by the shallow well wanting us and you left us in the palm-groves hard by. Our horses and camels walked on the crops and what they trod on they drove into the soft sand ‚Ä¶ Don't describe your fine horses, but speak of them as one who holds them firmly back. You rejoice in them, but that is the right of others, the horsemen of the sons of Fihr [Quraysh]. After the slaying of the Qurayza tribe in 627, Hassan ibn Thabit composed a poem to the effect that they had gone to Hell. Abu Sufyan responded with a counter-poem: May Allah make that deed immortal, May fire burn in its quarters! You shall know which of us is far [from Hellfire] and which of our lands will be harmed. Had the palms therein been horsemen, they would have said, \\"You have no place here, be off!\\" In 628 an Arab merchant gave a report of Muhammad to the Emperor Heraclius. This person, who claimed to be Muhammad's \\"nearest kin\\" among the party, is usually identified as Abu Sufyan ibn Harb; but Abu Sufyan ibn Al-Harith also claimed to have been present. He said: \\"I did not see myself with [Heraclius], while I had fled from Islam, yet knowing only Muhammad. Thus Islam entered me, and I realised the error of polytheism.\\" Conversion to Islam On the eve of the Conquest of Mecca in 630, Abu Sufyan decided to become a Muslim. Jumanah responded: \\"Finally, you see that Bedouins and foreigners have followed Muhammad, while you have been his confirmed foe! You should have been the first person to assist him!\\" Abu Sufyan urged his slave Madhkur to hurry saddling the camels and horse to meet Muhammad's army at al-Abwa. Together with Jumanah, Ja‚Äôfar and his cousin Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya, he travelled in disguise and in fear of his life, \\"for my blood was permitted.\\" When Muhammad's camel appeared, Abu Sufyan tried to make eye contact with his cousin, but Muhammad turned his face away. Abu Sufyan turned to the direction of his face, but Muhammad kept turning away. Abu Sufyan worried that he would be killed in revenge for his past hostility, although he hoped that Muhammad would be pleased about his conversion because of their original friendship. The other Muslims, including Abu Bakr, all followed Muhammad's example in turning away from Abu Sufyan, and Numan ibn Al-Harith, encouraged by Umar, followed him, taunting: \\"O enemy of Allah, you harm Allah‚Äôs Messenger and his companions. Your enmity to him is known all over the world!\\" Abu Sufyan appealed to his uncle Abbas for intercession, but Abbas said it would be useless. He then tried Ali, his brother-in-law, with a similar result. Abu Sufyan began to follow Muhammad's camp, sitting at Muhammad's tent door wherever he stopped, but he was ignored. At Niqu'l-‚ÄòUqab Muhammad's wife Umm Salama, who was Abdullah's sister, urged him to receive them. ‚ÄúAll the Quraysh were saying similar things, and you have forgiven people who are more criminal than he is.\\" Muhammad replied: \\"I have no use for them. As for [Abu Sufyan], he has wounded my pride; and as for [Abdullah], he spoke insultingly of me in Mecca.\\" When Abu Sufyan heard this message, he responded: \\"By Allah, he must let me in, or I will take this little boy of mine and we will wander through the land until we die of hunger and thirst.\\" This continued while Muhammad entered Mecca and became victorious. In Mecca Jumanah entered Muhammad's tent with some other visitors, and she was able to speak to him, but still he did not speak to Abu Sufyan. Finally Abu Sufyan followed Muhammad to the Battle of Hunayn. When the enemy approached, he jumped off his horse, sword in hand, wishing (as he later said) to die for Muhammad. When many of the Muslims fled, Abbas took the rein of Muhammad's grey mule, and Abu Sufyan took the other side. Muhammad asked who his defender was, and Abu Sufyan removed his helmet. Abbas said: \\"It's your brother and cousin, Abu Sufyan, so regard him with favour!\\" Muhammad replied: \\"I do. May Allah forgive him all his enmity toward me!\\" Abu Sufyan kissed his foot in the stirrup, and Muhammad declared, \\"This is my brother, upon my life!\\" Then Muhammad instructed Abbas to call back the Muslim army, and they attacked their ambushers. He later said that for this act of loyalty, Abu Sufyan and his family were guaranteed Paradise. Muhammad took a formal declaration of faith from both Abu Sufyan and Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya. Abu Sufyan composed a poem to explain his previous reluctance to convert. By thy life, when I carried a banner To give al-Lat‚Äôs cavalry the victory over Muhammad, I was like one going astray in the darkness of the night, But now I am led on the right track. I could not guide myself, and he who with Allah overcame me Was he whom I had driven away with all my might. [At this point, Muhammad punched his chest and said, \\"You did indeed!\\"] I used to do all I could to keep men from Muhammad, And I was called a relative of his, though I did not claim the relation. They are what they are. He who does not hold with them Though he be a man of sense is blamed and given the lie. I wanted to be on good terms with them [the Muslims], But I could not join them while I was not guided. Abu Sufyan became ‚Äúthe best of Muslims‚Äù and ‚Äúnothing bad was said about him‚Äù. Muhammad assigned him a pension of 100 wasqs from Khaybar. Three days before his death, Abu Sufyan dug his own grave in Al-Baqi' near the house of Aqeel ibn Abi Talib. His date of death is disputed: one source places it in February 641, another in 652. Umar presided over his funeral prayers.

In optimal circumstances, it lends itself to any stroke the swimmer wishes to perform. Resistance swimming can be carried out either against the pull of a tether or against the flow of water artificially set in motion by means of a swimming machine. Tethered swimming In its most simple form, it consists of swimming while being held relatively stationary by a flexible restraining device, such as a harness or a foot restraint. This training method is used by a number of swim teams, such as the ones at Purdue University, University of Indianapolis, Florida State University and the University of Florida. Likewise, Special Forces Scuba Team members at Fort Bragg use a commercial restraining device in their personal training for open water swimming. Users often indicate that it takes a certain amount of time to learn to compensate for the feeling of swimming against a restraint. However, for those who have familiarized themselves with these systems, tethers enable the swimmer to swim at any speed, even flat-out sprints, and to vary the speed at will. Tethered swimming, as this method is known, has been in use since the middle of the twentieth century, and has undergone a gradual evolution. Initially the swimmers were restrained by a rope, which was eventually supplanted by interlocked bicycle inner tubes or surgical tubing. Presently the systems in use employ either bungee cords or coiled lines to provide the shock-absorption necessary for a comfortable swim. Attachment methods also vary. Some devices restrain the swimmer by means of a belt, others wrap around the ankles, and still others connect to specially modified water shoes. Hybrid systems These swimming machines straddle the difference between traditional tethers and mechanical swimming machines. As a result, they combine the advantages of both, with a couple of drawbacks. They share the self-contained aspect of counter-current swimming machines with the low cost, simplicity and freedom of movement of tether systems. They are not strictly speaking \\"still-water pools\\" since the movements of the swimmer actually induce a gentle current of water which permits a more natural swimming experience. There are no energy costs (other than the water quality system) with these machines, as they use no electricity for swimming. While they are valuable for aerobic exercise, endurance and strength training, and for stroke practice, they cannot replicate open water conditions. Thus, for competition training they have to be complemented with open-water practice. Swimming machines Another form of resistance swimming is that in which the swimmer is unrestrained and the water is set in motion by means of mechanical devices, such as jets, propellers or paddle wheels. Such an apparatus is also known as a countercurrent swimming machine, of which a number are presently available commercially. A prototype machine was used by the Columbia University swim team in the late 1980s. Swimming machines made their appearance in the 1970s, initially in the form of jetted streams. Some of these were criticized for causing turbulence and an un-natural swimming environment. They were followed by paddle-wheel and propeller-driven machines, which were popularized by Endless Pools. These generated a smoother stream of water. Many users find them easy to swim in, but the machines are also criticized for being expensive, noisy, and wasteful of energy (consuming 6.5 kW to 11 kW of electricity just to set the water in motion). Finally, there are exercise machines which allow a person to remain on dry land while simulating certain swimming strokes. These devices however can not compensate for the weight of the body and the limbs and thus deprive the user of the benefits of exercise in an aquatic environment.

A khanjar (, , , , ) is a traditional dagger originating from Oman. Worn by men for ceremonial occasions, it is a short curved sword shaped like the letter \\"J\\" and resembles a hook. It can be made from a variety of different materials, depending on the quality of its craftsmanship. It is a popular souvenir among tourists and is sold in souqs throughout the region. A national symbol of the sultanate, the khanjar is featured on Oman's national emblem and on the Omani rial. It also features in logos and commercial imagery by companies based in Oman. History Although it is not known when the Omani khanjar was first created, rock carvings epitomizing the dagger were found on gravestones located in the central part of the Ru‚Äôus al Jibal region. These are believed to have predated the Wahhabi revival, which occurred in the late 1700s. They were also mentioned in an account by Robert Padbrugge of the Dutch Republic, who journeyed to Muscat in June 1672. The Ottoman Empire spread further the use of this type of knife. In the Balkans, where it was known as Handschar, such knives were regularly carried by Ottoman policemen, and it remained in local use also after the end of Ottoman rule. During the Second World War, the knife's name was bestowed on the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers, the knife also appeared on the division's emblem. The word ÿÆŸÜÿ¨ÿ± appears to be the arabized version of the Persian word ÿÆŸàŸÜ⁄Øÿ±. Usage and symbolism =Composition and manufacturing= The national emblem of Oman featuring the khanjar at the centre Depending on the quality of its craftsmanship, the Omani khanjar can be made using a variety of different metals and other materials. Gold or silver would be used to make khanjar of the finest quality (e.g. for royalty), while brass and copper would be utilized for daggers made by local craftsmen. For instance, a sheath adorned with gold was historically limited to the Omani upper class. White or Ivory handled and sheathed ones are preferred by the Sayyids or Hashemites symbolising their status in society. Najeeb Altarfayn Saadah in Oman and Arabia usually carry two of them. Traditionally, the dagger is designed by its future owner himself, with the craftsman taking into account the \\"specifications\\" and \\"preferences\\" stipulated by the former. The time it takes to manufacture a khanjar can range from three weeks to several months. The most elemental sections of the khanjar are its handle and blade, with the material utilized in the former playing a significant role influencing the final price of the dagger. Rhinoceros horn and ivory were once the common standard, as it was \\"considered the best material\\" to make the hilt out of. However, with the international ban on the ivory trade and rhinoceros horn, the usage of other materials such as wood, plastic, and camel bone has become more prevalent. Typically, the top of the hilt is flat, but the one designed for the royal family is in the shape of a cross. =Custom= The Omani khanjar is tucked underneath a waist belt and is situated at the front and centre of the wearer's body. It used to form part of everyday attire; however, it is now carried as a \\"ceremonial dagger\\", and worn only for formal events and ceremonies ‚Äì such as weddings, parades, meetings, and diplomatic functions ‚Äì among many other occasions. Labelled a \\"ubiquitous sign of masculinity\\" by John M. Willis in The Arab Studies Journal, the khanjar is a symbol of \\"manhood, power and authority\\", as well as serving as a status symbol for the person wearing it. As a result, it is sometimes given by families to their sons when they reach adolescence, and is a common wedding gift to the groom. Although the khanjar was originally created as a weapon to attack and defend, it is utilized solely for ceremonial and practical purposes today. The latter situation would occur in the desert, where it is used as a tool for hunting and skinning animals, as well as for slicing ropes. Because of this development, it is now considered a \\"social taboo\\" in Oman to pull out one's khanjar from its scabbard without blooding it, since the only time men would do this would be to seek vengeance or to defend oneself. =Distribution= While the khanjar is most prevalent in Oman given its symbolic status there, it is also worn by men in Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, forming an integral component of \\"traditional dress\\" in those countries. It can also be found and is sold in other Persian Gulf states, such as the Souq Waqif in Doha, Qatar. The khanjar is a popular keepsake among tourists, and is the Sultanate's best-selling memento. =Other uses= rial note. Official government As the khanjar is a national symbol of Oman, it is featured on the sultanate's national emblem. It has been a symbol on the royal crest of the Al Said dynasty since the 18th century, which subsequently became the national emblem. It is also depicted on the Omani rial ‚Äì the country's currency ‚Äì specifically on the one rial note, as well as on postage stamps issued by the sultanate. Furthermore, there are statues of khanjar on buildings housing government ministries and at various roundabouts throughout the country. =Commercial= The khanjar was previously shown prominently on the logo and planes of Oman Air ‚Äì the country's flag carrier ‚Äì until it was removed under a rebranding in 2008. The logo of Omantel also illustrates a stylized khanjar; it was retained in the logotype's motif after the telecommunications company merged with Oman Mobile in 2010. Moreover, the perfume company Amouage, which is owned by the Sultan of Oman and his royal family, incorporates the dagger into the design of its bottles. The cap on its Gold for Men perfume bottle resembles the handle of a khanjar, complementing the Gold for Women cap which evokes the dome of Ruwi Mosque.

History CIU began in 1923 when it was founded as Columbia Bible School. The original purpose was to provide a two-year course of study in biblical studies for local mill workers. By 1927, the decision was made to convert the school into a college and begin offering bachelor's degrees in Bible. A location in downtown Columbia was established and the first dean (later president) of the college was chosen. The school continued to grow and eventually required a new campus. The college was relocated in 1960 to its present facility on Monticello Road. It was during 1968 that the institution‚Äôs longest serving president, Robertson McQuilkin, son of the first president of Columbia Bible College, was inaugurated. During this period, the institution also changed its name to Columbia Bible College and Seminary. The name was changed yet again in 1994 to Columbia International University to highlight the growing educational mission as well as to demonstrate a commitment to preparing students from all parts of the world for global Christian service. Former presidents include Drs. RC McQuilkin, G. Alen Fleece, Robertson McQuilkin, Johnny Miller, George Murray, and Bill Jones. Divisions CIU Seal CIU has five colleges: the College of Arts & Sciences, the College of Counseling, the College of Education, the College of Intercultural Studies, and the Seminary & School of Ministry. Because of the closely knit nature of the institution and the emphasis on Christian education and biblical studies regardless of major, many of the colleges share faculty members.Columbia International University 2013‚Äì2014 Academic Catalog Academics CIU's traditional academic emphasis has been placed on primarily on cross cultural work, followed by biblical studies and the humanities and liberal arts rather than natural sciences, in addition to strong emphasis on ministerial skills at the undergraduate level. This is evidenced by the fact that there are undergraduate and graduate majors relating directly to ministry but not in the sciences. =Accreditation= CIU is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools for its undergraduate and graduate programs and is listed as a Level VI school, the highest degree level offered, meaning that it offers four or more doctoral degrees. CIU is also accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Association for Biblical Higher Education with its next ten year review in 2029. The seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada to award the Master of Divinity, the Master of Arts and the Doctor of Ministry. The Graduate School is also accredited by the South Carolina Department of Education to offer graduate degrees in early childhood and elementary education leading to certification as a teacher in State of South Carolina. Student life Like most evangelical schools and many seminaries, CIU does have doctrinal affirmations and lifestyle standards which all students (regardless of degree sought) are expected to affirm as a part of admission. =Doctrinal standards= There are seven doctrinal points which students must assent to as a part of their admission to and candidacy for a degree from CIU. These are biblical inspiration, natural separation of humanity from God, salvation by grace through faith in Christ, the historical doctrine of the Trinity, the bodily resurrection of Christ from the dead, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the believer, and the evangelical mandate to witness to the gospel of Christ. Additionally, the doctrine of Premillennialism is officially held by the school, but students are not required to adhere to this doctrine. CIU requires all teaching faculty to affirm Premillennialism.CIU 2013‚Äì2014 Academic Catalog =Lifestyle standards= CIU holds to a goal of spiritual formation in preparation for life after college. Students are required to sign a covenant form agreeing to keep various lifestyle standards established by the university. Some of the standards include prohibition from alcohol and tobacco. Students are required to complete a Spiritual Growth and Self Assessment ‚Äì a narrative of a student‚Äôs spiritual journey during the year. Though not required during summer and winter breaks, students are expected to maintain CIU lifestyle standards. The standards have been a point of contention for many years. While not actively publicized, a complete handbook is available for viewing at . In the spring semester of 2007, one of the most contentious standards, the \\"physical expression of affection\\" standard (dating couples may not hold hands or kiss, but may only hug briefly) was revised to allow for more freedom of physical expressions (couples dating seriously are now allowed to hold hands and kiss briefly). Denominational relationships CIU is not directly affiliated or sponsored by any single denomination though welcomes all students from any number of evangelical Christian denominations and somewhat more loosely, any Protestant denomination. While CIU does have enrolled students and faculty who are members of Christian communities which would not typically be identified as evangelical Protestant, it does require that all faculty and staff belong to a local Protestant church. This policy was enforced some years ago when one faculty member, Dr. Edward Rommen, was removed from his seminary teaching post upon his conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy and reception into the Orthodox Church in America. Prior to his removal from the faculty, Dr. Rommen was a prominent member of the Evangelical Free Church of America. Additional programs While the primary mission of CIU is to provide an evangelical higher education to its students, the corporate entity also includes Ben Lippen School. =Ben Lippen School= Ben Lippen is a private, interdenominational Christian school located on the CIU campus. It was founded as a boarding school in Asheville, North Carolina in the 1940s, but was moved to its current location in 1988, offering middle and high school programs. An elementary school away from the main CIU campus was begun in 1989, and in 2006 a main elementary school campus was completed on CIU grounds and classes began there in August. The schools are co-educational and feature a mix of commuting and resident students. The curriculum mirrors most public institutions with the exception of teaching subject from an evangelical Christian worldview and the inclusion of Bible classes and chapel for students, faculty, and staff. In 2013, there were nearly 800 students enrolled at the school. Notable alumni *Doris Bartholomew *Chet Bitterman *P. T.

It was also a historical name applied to the Americas and to the New World. The association has given rise to the names of many American places, objects, institutions and companies; such as: Columbia University, the District of Columbia (U.S. capital), \\"Hail, Columbia\\" (unofficial national and official vice-presidential anthem), as well as the ship Columbia Rediviva, which would give its name to the Columbia River. Images of the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World, erected in 1886) largely displaced personified Columbia as the female symbol of the United States by around 1920, although Lady Liberty was seen as an aspect of Columbia. Columbia is a New Latin toponym, in use since the 1730s with reference to the Thirteen Colonies which would go on to form the United States. It originated from the name of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus and from the ending -ia, common in Latin names of countries (paralleling Britannia, Gallia, and others).  History  Personification of the Americas in Meissen porcelain, c. 1760, from a set of the Four Continents. =Early= The earliest type of personification of the Americas, seen in European art from the 16th century onwards, reflected the tropical regions in South and Central America from which the earliest travellers reported back. These were most often used in sets of female personifications of the Four Continents. America was depicted as a woman who, like Africa, was only partly dressed, typically in bright feathers, which invariably formed her headress. She often held a parrot, was seated on a caiman or alligator, with a cornucopia. Sometimes a severed head was a further attribute, or in prints scenes of cannibalism were seen in the background.Le Corbellier, 210‚Äì218; Higham, 45‚Äì52 =18th century= Though versions of this depiction, tending as time went on to soften the rather savage image into an \\"Indian princess\\" type, and in churches emphasizing conversion to Christianity, served European artists well enough, by the 18th century they were becoming rejected by settlers in North America, who wanted figures representing themselves rather than the Native Americans they were often in conflict with.Higham, 55‚Äì57 Massachusetts Chief Justice Samuel Sewall used the name Columbina (not Columbia) for the New World in 1697.Thomas J. Schlereth, \\"Columbia, Columbus, and Columbianism\\" in The Journal of American History, v. 79, no. 3 (1992), 939 The name Columbia for America first appeared in 1738The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285 Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Dec. 1885, pp. 159‚Äì65 in the weekly publication of the debates of Parliament in Edward Cave's The Gentleman's Magazine. Publication of Parliamentary debates was technically illegal, so the debates were issued under the thin disguise of Reports of the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput and fictitious names were used for most individuals and placenames found in the record. Most of these were transparent anagrams or similar distortions of the real names and some few were taken directly from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels while a few others were classical or neoclassical in style. Such were Ierne for Ireland, Iberia for Spain, Noveborac for New York (from Eboracum, the Roman name for York) and Columbia for America‚Äîat the time used in the sense of \\"European colonies in the New World\\".Debates in Parliament, Samuel Johnson. Columbia and an early rendition of Uncle Sam in an 1869 Thomas Nast cartoon having Thanksgiving dinner with a diverse group of immigrants An 1872 painting titled American Progress which depicts Columbia as the Spirit of the Frontier, carrying telegraph lines across the Western frontier to fulfill manifest destiny By the time of the Revolution, the name Columbia had lost the comic overtone of its Lilliputian origins and had become established as an alternative, or poetic name for America. While the name America is necessarily scanned with four syllables, according to 18th-century rules of English versification Columbia was normally scanned with three, which is often more metrically convenient. For instance, the name appears in a collection of complimentary poems written by Harvard graduates in 1761 on the occasion of the marriage and coronation of King George III.Hoyt, Albert. \\"The Name 'Columbia'\\", The New England Historical & Genealogical Register, July 1886, pp. 310‚Äì13. :Behold, Britannia! in thy favour'd Isle; :At distance, thou, Columbia! view thy Prince, :For ancestors renowned, for virtues more;Pietas et Gratulatio Collegii Cantabrigiensis apud Novanglos, no. xxix. Boston, Green and Russell, 1761. The name Columbia rapidly came to be applied to a variety of items reflecting American identity. A ship built in Massachusetts in 1773 received the name Columbia Rediviva and it later became famous as an exploring ship and lent its name to new Columbias. =After Independence= No serious consideration was given to using the name Columbia as an official name for the independent United States, but with independence, the name became popular and was given to many counties, townships, and towns as well as other institutions. * In 1784, the former King's College in New York City had its name changed to Columbia College, which became the nucleus of the present-day Ivy League Columbia University. * In 1786, South Carolina gave the name Columbia to its new capital city. Columbia is also the name of at least 19 other towns in the United States. * In 1791, three commissioners appointed by President George Washington named the area destined for the seat of the United States government the Territory of Columbia. In 1801, it was organized as the District of Columbia. * In 1792, the Columbia Rediviva sailing ship gave its name to the Columbia River in the American Northwest (much later, the Rediviva would give its name to the Space Shuttle Columbia). * In 1798, Joseph Hopkinson wrote lyrics for Philip Phile's 1789 inaugural \\"President's March\\" under the new title of \\"Hail, Columbia\\". Once used as de facto national anthem of the United States, it is now used as the entrance march of the Vice President of the United States. * In 1821, citizens of Boone County, Missouri, chose the name for their new city, Columbia, Missouri, * In 1865 Jules Verne's novel From the Earth to the Moon, the spacecraft to the Moon was fired from a giant Columbiad cannon. In part, the more frequent usage of the name \\"Columbia\\" reflected a rising American neoclassicism, exemplified in the tendency to use Roman terms and symbols. The selection of the eagle as the national bird, the heraldric use of the eagle, the use of the term Senate to describe the upper house of Congress and the naming of Capitol Hill and the Capitol building were all conscious evocations of Roman precedents. The adjective Columbian has been used to mean \\"of or from the United States of America\\" such as in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago, Illinois. It has occasionally been proposed as an alternative word for American. Columbian should not be confused with the adjective pre-Columbian, which refers to a time period before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492.  Personification  Puck, April 6, 1901) As a quasi-mythical figure, Columbia first appears in the poetry of the African-American Phillis Wheatley in 1776, during the Revolutionary War: Especially in the 19th century, Columbia was visualized as a goddess-like female national personification of the United States and of liberty itself, comparable to the British Britannia, the Italian Italia Turrita and the French Marianne, often seen in political cartoons of the 19th and early 20th century. The personification was sometimes called Lady Columbia or Miss Columbia. Such an iconography usually personified America in the form of an Indian queen or Native American princess. The image of the personified Columbia was never fixed, but she was most often presented as a woman between youth and middle age, wearing classically-draped garments decorated with stars and stripes. A popular version gave her a red-and-white- striped dress and a blue blouse, shawl, or sash, spangled with white stars. Her headdress varied and sometimes it included feathers reminiscent of a Native American headdress while other times it was a laurel wreath, but most often, it was a cap of liberty. Early in World War I (1914‚Äì1918), the image of Columbia standing over a kneeling \\"Doughboy\\" was issued in lieu of the Purple Heart medal. She gave \\"to her son the accolade of the new chivalry of humanity\\" for injuries sustained in \\"the\\" World War. In World War I, the name Liberty Bond for savings bonds was heavily publicized, often with images from the Statue of Liberty. The personification of Columbia fell out of use and was largely replaced by the Statue of Liberty as a feminine symbol of the United States. After Columbia Pictures adopted Columbia as its logo in 1924, she has since appeared as bearing a torch similar to that of the Statue of Liberty, unlike 19th-century depictions of Columbia. Statues of the personified Columbia may be found among others in the following places: * The 1863 Statue of Freedom atop the United States Capitol building, though not actually called Columbia, shares many of her iconic characteristics. * Atop Philadelphia's Memorial Hall, built 1876 * The replica Statue of the Republic (Golden Lady) in Chicago's Jackson Park is often understood to be Columbia. It is one of the remaining icons of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. * In the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, dedicated 1949. * In the Monument of Angola, Indiana.  Modern appearances  Since 1800, the name \\"Columbia\\" has been used for a wide variety of items. * The naming of the New World and of the newly-independent country of Colombia after Christopher Columbus in the early 19th century is discussed at Colombia ¬ß Etymology. * Columbia, Missouri * In the 1840s, British Columbia, which is now now a province of Canada, was named by Queen Victoria. The details of the naming of the Columbia River and the Columbia provinces around it are discussed at British Columbia ¬ß Etymology. * The element niobium was first called columbium, a name which some people still use today. The name columbium, coined by the chemist Charles Hatchett upon his discovery of the metal in 1801, reflected that the type specimen of the ore came from America. * Avenues and streets in various cities and towns throughout the United States named Columbia Avenue or Columbia Street, such as the Columbia Avenue Historic District in Davenport, Iowa, and various Columbia Avenues in Pennsylvania cities. * Columbia County, Pennsylvania. * Columbia, Kentucky in Adair County. * Columbia, Pennsylvania in Lancaster County. * Columbia, Maryland in Howard County. * Columbia, Connecticut in Tolland County. * Columbia, South Carolina * Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City that first adopted the name Columbia College in 1784 to replace King's College * The song \\"Hail, Columbia,\\" an American patriotic song.

As development continued, the name was changed to DDML, reflecting a shift away from the goal of replicating all DTD functionality, in order to concentrate on providing a robust framework for describing basic element/attribute hierarchy. DDML offered no datatypes or functionality beyond what DTDs already provided, so there was not much advantage to using DDML instead of DTDs.

Illustration from the late 19th Century. Memorial to Fran√ßois d'Arlandes in Anneyron Fran√ßois Laurent le Vieux d'Arlandes (; 1742 ‚Äì 1 May 1809) was a French marquis, soldier and a pioneer of hot air ballooning. He and Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier made the first manned free balloon flight on 21 November 1783, in a Montgolfier balloon. D'Arlandes was born in Anneyron in the Dauphin√©. He met Joseph Montgolfier at the Jesuit college of Tournon. He became an infantry officer in the French royal guard. The first public demonstration of a balloon by the Montgolfier brothers took place in June 1783, and was followed by an untethered flight of a sheep, a cockerel and a duck from the front courtyard of the Palace of Versailles on 19 September. The French King Louis XVI decided that the first manned flight would contain two condemned criminals, but de Rozier enlisted the help of the Duchess de Polignac to support his view that the honour of becoming first balloonists should belong to someone of higher status, and d'Arlandes agreed to accompany him. The King was persuaded to permit d'Arlandes and de Rozier to become the first pilots. After several tethered tests to gain some experience of controlling the balloon, de Rozier and d'Arlandes made their first untethered flight in a Montgolfier hot air balloon on 21 November 1783, taking off at 1:54 p.m. from the garden of the Ch√¢teau de la Muette in the Bois de Boulogne, in the presence of the King. Also watching was U.S. envoy, Benjamin Franklin. Their 25-minute flight travelled slowly about 5¬Ω miles (some 9 km) to the southeast, attaining an altitude of 3,000 feet, before returning to the ground at the Butte-aux-Cailles, then on the outskirts of Paris. After the flight, the pilots drank champagne to celebrate the flight, a tradition carried on by balloonists to this day. D'Arlandes proposed a flight to cross the English Channel in 1784, but the plan came to nothing. He was dismissed from the army for cowardice after the French Revolution, and died in his castle of Saleton near Anneyron. Some sources suggest that he committed suicide.

Muntilan is about 15 km south of Magelang, 10 km from Mungkid, 25 km north of Yogyakarta, and 90 km from the main town of Semarang located on the northern coast of Java. The town of Muntilan is on the old railway route between Kebon Polo station in Magelang and the main Tugu station in Yogyakarta. Tourists on their way to the well-known Buddhist temple Borobudur usually pass through Muntilan. Muntilan township is one of the main market centers on the western slopes of Mount Merapi, a major volcano in central Java within the administrative ambit of the regional government in Magelang. The locality is densely populated: in 2016, there was a population of around 79,500 people living in an area of approximately 28.6 km2, indicating a population density of almost 2,800 per km2.Source: Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics. History The adjacent countryside has many villages with pesantren and strong allegiances to more stricter forms of Islam. In contrast, villages closer to the Kraton palaces of Surakarta and Yogyakarta tend to more influenced by syncretic views of Javanese beliefs. Jesuits have long had a presence in the town, having a schoolSMA Pangudi Luhur Van Lith, seminary, and a necropolis containing the remains of many of their earlier members.Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder being a more recent internee. Frans van Lith, a Jesuit priest from The Netherlands, arrived in Muntilan in 1897 and played an important role in promoting Catholicism in the area. Indonesia's first Catholic cardinal, Justinus Darmojuwono, is buried in Kerkhoof Muntilan, a cemetery for prominent Catholics in the town. During the Second World War, Muntilan was the site of a Japanese prisoner of war camp which contained many Dutch families. Current The streetscape of Muntilan along Jl Pemuda (Pemuda street) provides one of the more classic street views in Central Java. The line of shop-fronts, and the enclave of Chinese-based businesses in the central area, provide clues as to the nature of commercial development in the town over the last century. The area is at ever-present risk of needing to respond to natural disasters caused by eruptions of Mt Merapi. In 1994, for example, a pyroclastic flow from Mt Merapi killed over 20 people in the Muntilan area.

The church has an estimated membership of 27,500-50,000 members.Burgess, Stanley M. and Van de Maas, Edouard M. (eds.) \\"United House of Prayer For All People, Church on the Rock of the Apostolic Faith\\" in The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002). The national headquarters for the church is located in Washington, D.C. at 601 M Street. The United House of Prayer for All People runs soul food restaurants that serve the communities and holds annual \\"Christian Saints\\" marching parades in honor of its past bishops. The United House of Prayer for All People is noted for its public street baptisms, sometimes performed by fire hose, and for its shout bands. Doctrine The United House of Prayer for All People is Apostolic in doctrine. Its creed establishes its basic principles as believing in Jesus Christ and his death on the cross so that humanity could have life, water baptism for the repentance of sin, that to be saved one must be born again of the Holy Spirit, and that one leader is the Divine ruler of the Kingdom of God. The United House of Prayer for All People's sacred text is the Holy Bible. The first portion of the name is derived from Isaiah 56:7 where God says: \\"Mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.\\" (This is also found in Matthew 21:13, Mark 11:17, and Luke 19:46). The latter part is taken from \\"Acts 4:10‚Äì12 and Ephesians 2:20, which discusses Christian salvation as being built on a figurative cornerstone, or rock,\\" which \\"is believed to be the teachings of Jesus Christ as preached by the Apostle Peter.\\" The United House of Prayer for All People believes that the word church means a group of Christians who are believers and worshippers in Christ and that the modern definition of church as a building, denomination, or institution is unbiblical according to the writings of the Holy Scriptures as recorded in Acts 9:31.\\"The Truth and Facts of the United House of Prayer and the Most Honorable Bishop Dr. S.C. Madison (2005) p.30 Therefore, the United House of Prayer does not see itself as a denomination. History =Bishop Grace= Bishop Charles Manuel \\"Sweet Daddy\\" Grace was born Marcelino Manuel da Graca, January 25, 1884, in Brava, Cape Verde Islands, a Portuguese possession off the west coast of Africa. He came to America on a ship called Freedom in 1903 and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After leaving his job as a railway cook, Grace began using the title bishop. In 1919, \\"Daddy\\" Grace, as parishioners knew him, built the first House of Prayer in West Wareham, Massachusetts at the cost of thirty- nine dollars. He later established branches in Charlotte, North Carolina and Newark, New Jersey. The \\"Mother House\\" in Harlem, New York City was founded in 1920 by Bishop Grace; the congregation moved to this building after their first house burned down in 1947 Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Grace traveled America preaching and establishing the United House of Prayer for all People. The constitution and bylaws of The United House of Prayer, promulgated in 1929, stated that the purpose of the organization in pertinent part was \\"to erect and maintain places of worship and assembly where all people may gather prayer and to worship the Almighty God, irrespective of denomination or creed.\\" He traveled extensively throughout the segregated South in the 1920s and 1930s preaching to integrated congregations years before the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and the religious ecumenical movements which followed. One of the principles that Grace taught which provoked controversy was the concept of one-man leadership. Grace used the Bible as his reference and taught that God only used one man at a time (e.g. Noah, Moses, and Jesus. One of the many criticisms made against Grace is the following statement which Grace is to have allegedly made in the early 1940s: \\"Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He is on vacation, don't worry about Him. If you sin against God, Grace can save you, but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you.\\"Fauset, Arthur. Black Gods of the Metropolis, p.26 Nonetheless, the \\"interpretation of this point ‚Äì that Grace claimed he himself was God ‚Äì has been almost completely definitive in both academic and popular literature, and only a handful of writers have ever questioned it, usually as an aside.\\"Dallam, Marie W. Daddy Grace: A Celebrity Preacher and His House of Prayer, pp.57,87 The most extensive research done by Danielle Brune Sigler on this statement shows that Mr. Fauset selectively quoted certain parts of the original message which changed the context.\\" The original statement, spoken by a member and not Grace, shows that the members and Grace, himself, thought that he was not \\"God himself\\", but merely an \\"intermediary\\" and \\"the path to salvation.\\"Brune, Danielle. \\"Sweet Daddy Grace: The Life and Times of a Modern Day Prophet\\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas, Austin, 2002), pp.64‚Äì71,170 One reason for the early success of the denomination is that offerings went directly to Grace for investment into products such as soap, stationery, tea, coffee, cookies, toothpaste, facial creams, talcum powder, hair dressing, and the Grace Magazine. Bishop Grace died on January 12, 1960, at his home in Los Angeles, California. Bishop W. McCollough succeeded him and served for 31 years. =Bishop McCollough= When Grace died he left the church with an unclear succession. After winning a court fight and two elections, Walter McCollough succeeded Grace as the second bishop. Bishop McCollough launched a nationwide building program. Through this program, low-income and affordable housing was being erected. New church structures were built by their own construction teams and other edifices received major renovations, financed solely by the members. Day care centers and senior citizens homes were also erected. One of the unique features of Daddy McCollough's building programs was that all of the church structures were completely paid for at the time of dedication. Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Under his leadership, the House of Prayer acquired a fleet of luxury coach buses; property was acquired for the House of Prayer for use as future development sites; concert and marching bands were organized to march in annual parades and annual competitions; and softball teams were organized, nationwide, for interstate competition. In addition, the McCollough Scholarship Fund was established which allowed youth of the church to pursue higher education. Bishop McCollough died on March 21, 1991. =Bishop Madison= Once again a crisis occurred over the succession, with Charles McCollough, a son of the late Bishop McCollough, and Samuel Christian Madison, the Senior Minister of \\"God's White House\\", struggling for control of the church. On May 24, 1991, the members voted Madison to the office of Bishop. Shortly after, Madison pledged to fulfill everything that was on Bishop McCollough's agenda. Under his administration, over 123 Houses of Prayer received major renovation or were constructed. Added to this number were numerous apartments, senior citizens' dwellings, parsonages, houses, and commercial properties. Bishop Madison was an advocate for scholastic achievement and was the chief executive officer and major contributor to the McCollough Scholarship College Fund. Madison expanded the academic programs of the organization through inaugurating the Annual First Lady Scholastic Achievement Awards Program. Bishop Madison died on April 5, 2008. =Bishop Bailey= Bishop C. M. (sometimes known as \\"Sweet Daddy\\") Bailey, a native of Newport News, Virginia, and the former pastor/apostle of the United House of Prayer For All People in Augusta, Georgia (the \\"Motherhouse\\" or parent church for their ministry in Georgia), succeeded Madison on May 23, 2008. He was elected during Memorial Week in Washington, D. C. after having won 91% of the electoral votes by the General Assembly. As a result of the appointment, he became Sole Trustee of the United House of Prayer, and C.E.O. Structure Near Northeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The United House of Prayer as defined in their constitution and by-laws is composed of the bishop, elders, ministers, deacons, and all persons who assemble themselves in the various places of assembly maintained by the organization.Constitution and By-Laws of the United House of Prayer For All People of the Church on the Rock of the Apostolic Faith (1992), pp.2,3,4,6 \\"On a broader organization level, each House of Prayer belonged to a regional district\\" and each district is chaired by a minister who is the state chairman. The organization also has what they call the General Assembly which consist of the bishop, ministers, elders, and two elected representatives from each congregation. The General Assembly is the vehicle used to make amendments to the constitution and by-laws, to fill vacancies in the office of bishop, and to remove the bishop for cause. Besides the bishop, the General Assembly, ministers, and members, there exist an ecclesiastical court called the General Council.The Supreme Laws For The Government of the United House of Prayer For All People of the Church on the Rock of the Apostolic Faith (2005) p.1 The General Council consist of the bishop, state chairmen and others who are appointed by the bishop and their primary responsibility is to protect the work of the organization and the bishop and to ensure that all houses and members are compliant with laws outlined in the Supreme Laws For the Government of the United House of Prayer. The constitution and by-laws of the organization stipulate that the bishop must be in full knowledge of the doctrine of the United House of Prayer, ready to give answers in good faith, able to judge the various members among the church and congregations, and must be continuously working for the good of the organization in accordance with the rules of the New Testament. The bishop's role includes the power to select, ordain, and supervise ministers. He is also designated on behalf of the members as trustee of all church property. Memorial A mausoleum in memory of W. McCollough and S. C. Madison was built in Lincoln Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland. The monument also honors C. M. Grace and the United House of Prayer for All People of the Church on The Rock of The Apostolic Faith. The memorial features several larger-than-lifesize statues. W.

Danielpour's notable works include First Light (1988) for chamber orchestra, three symphonies (1985, 1986, and 1990), four piano concerti (1981, 1993, 2002 and 2009), the ballet Anima mundi (1995), and the opera Margaret Garner (2005).

Although damaged by a bulldozer it was recognized, documented and described by archeologist Italo Biddittu, who happened to be present when the fossil came to light. and Mallegni et al. (2003) proposed the introduction of a new human species, dubbed Homo cepranensis, based on the fossil. although other paleontologists have classified it as belonging to Homo heidelbergensis. Mounier et al. (2011) have identified the fossil as \\"an appropriate ancestral stock\\" of H. heidelbergensis, \\"preceding the appearance of regional autapomorphic features\\". \\"The result of this peculiar morphology is that Ceprano clusters in our analysis with other European, African and Asian Mid-Pleistocene specimens ‚Äì such as Petralona, Dali, Kabwe, Jinniu Shan, Steinheim, and SH5 ‚Äì furnishing a rather plesiomorphic phenetic link among them. On the basis of this morphological affinity, it seems appropriate to group Ceprano with these fossils, and consider them as a single taxon. The available nomen for this putative species is H. heidelbergensis, whose distinctiveness stands on the retention of a number of archaic traits combined with features that are more derived and independent from any Neandertal ancestry. [...] This result would suggest that H. ergaster survived as a distinct species until 1 Ma, and would discard the validity of the species H. cepranensis, which was based on the claimed affinities between Daka and Ceprano that we did not observe. ...the mandible AT-888 associated with the SH5 cranium from Atapuerca has been shown to share affinities with the holotype of H. heidelbergensis: the Mauer mandible. Thus we can include the so-called ‚ÄúAnte-Neandertals‚Äù from Europe in the same taxonomical unit with other Mid-Pleistocene samples from Africa and continental Asia. Combining the results of the two approaches of our phenetic analysis, Ceprano should be reasonably accommodated as part of a Mid-Pleistocene human taxon H. heidelbergensis, which would include European, African, and Asian specimens. Moreover, the combination of archaic and derived features exhibited by the Italian specimen represents a ‚Äúnode‚Äù connecting the different poles of such a polymorphic humanity.\\" The holotype (see image) of Homo cepranenis has a unique combination of morphological features: 1: incomplete sulcus supraorbitalis, 2: frontal tuber weakly developed medially shifted, 3: supraorbital region medially concave, 4: intermediate position of the external auditory meatus in regard to the processus zygomaticus temporalis); 5 and 6 (blue) = more derived traits (i.e. 5: straight torus occipitalis transversus, 6: medio-lateral concavity of the articular tubercle); 7 to 10 (green) = more primitive traits (i.e. 7: petro-tympanic crest orientated downward, 8: opisthocranion coincident with inion, 9: processus retromastoideus, 10: torus angularis parietalis. The fossil was first estimated to be between 690,000 to 900,000 years old determined on the basis of regional correlations and a series of absolute dates. Taking the circumstances of the recovery of the fossil into account A. Ascenzi (2001) stated: \\"...given the absence in the sediments containing the cranium of any leucitic remnants of the more recent volcanic activity known in the region‚Äîthat are referred to the range between 100 and 700 ka and the presence above the cranium itself of a clear stratigraphic unconformity that marks the lowest limit of the sandy leucitic pyroclasts, an age between 800 and 900 ka is at present our best chronological estimate.[sic]\\" After clarification of its geostratigraphic, biostratigraphic and archaeological relation to the well known and nearby Acheulean site of Fontana Ranuccio, dated to , Muttoni et al. (2009) suggested that Ceprano is most likely about 450,000 years old - the mid of the Middle Pleistocene. The cranial features on the bone seem to be intermediate between those found on Homo erectus and those of later species, such as Homo heidelbergensis, that dominated Europe long before Homo neanderthalensis. A 2011 study suggested that it was ancestral to Homo neanderthalensis.

Discovered in 1938, it was among the first early hominins described and the first discovered robust australopithecine, and became the type species for the genus Paranthropus. However, it is argued that Paranthropus is an invalid grouping and synonymous with Australopithecus, so the species is also often classified as Australopithecus robustus. Robust australopithecines are characterised by heavily built skulls capable of producing high stresses and bite forces, and some of the largest molars with the thickest enamel of any known ape. Males had more heavily built skulls than females. P. robustus may have had a genetic susceptibility for pitting enamel hypoplasia on the teeth, and seems to have had a dental cavity rate similar to non-agricultural modern humans. The species is thought to have exhibited marked sexual dimorphism, with males substantially larger and more robust than females. Based on 3 specimens, males may have been tall and females . Based on 4 specimens, males averaged in weight and females . The brain volume of the specimen SK 1585 is estimated to have been 476 cc. P. robustus limb anatomy is similar to that of other australopithecines, which may indicate a less efficient walking ability than modern humans, and perhaps some degree of arboreality in the trees. P. robustus seems to have consumed a high proportion of C4 savanna plants. In addition, P. robustus may have also consumed fruits, underground storage organs, and perhaps honey and termites. P. robustus may have used bones as tools to extract and process food. It is unclear if P. robustus lived in a harem society like gorillas or a multi-male society like baboons. P. robustus society may have been patrilocal, with adult females more likely to leave the group than males, but males may have been more likely to be evicted indicated by higher male mortality rates and assumed increased risk of predation to solitary individuals. P. robust contended with sabertooth cats, leopards, and hyenas on the mixed, open-to-closed landscape, and P. robustus bones probably accumulated in caves due to big cat predation. It is typically found in what were mixed open and wooded environments, and may have gone extinct in the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and the continual prolonging of dry cycles and subsequent retreat of such habitat. Taxonomy =Research history= Cast of TM 1517, the holotype specimen of P. robustus The first remains, a partial skull including a part of the jawbone (TM 1517), were discovered in June 1938 at Kromdraai, South Africa, by local schoolboy Gert Terblanche. He gave the remains to South African conservationist Charles Sydney Barlow, who then relayed it to South African palaeontologist Robert Broom. A few weeks later, Broom recovered a distal right humerus (at the elbow joint), a proximal right ulna (also elbow), and 2 toe bones, which he assigned to the specimen. He also identified a distal toe phalanx bone which he believed belonged to a baboon, but has since been associated with the specimen. Broom noted the Kromdraai remains were especially robust compared to other hominins. At this point in time, Australian anthropologist Raymond Dart had made the very first claim (quite controversially at the time) of an early ape-like human ancestor in 1924 from South Africa, Australopithecus africanus, based on the Taung child. In 1936, Broom had described \\"Plesianthropus transvaalensis\\" (now synonymised with A. africanus) from the Sterkfontein Caves only west from Kromdraii. Broom considered all these species, which dated to the Pleistocene and were found in the same general vicinity (now called the \\"Cradle of Humankind\\"), evidence of a greater diversity of hominins in the Pliocene out of which they and modern humans descended from, and that several hominin taxa existed alongside human ancestors. In August 1938, Broom classified the robust Kromdraai remains into a new genus as Paranthropus robustus. \\"Paranthropus\\" derives from Ancient Greek œÄŒ±œÅŒ± para beside or alongside; and Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ √°nthropos man. In 1948, at the nearby Swartkrans Cave, Broom and Robinson described \\"P. crassidens\\" based on a subadult jaw, SK 6, which was younger than the fossils from Kromdraai. They believed that the Swartkrans Paranthropus were reproductively isolated from Kromdraai Paranthropus and they eventually speciated. At this point in time, humans and ancestors were classified into the family Hominidae, and other apes into \\"Pongidae\\"; in 1950, Broom suggested separating early hominins into the subfamilies Australopithecinae (A. africanus and \\"P. transvaalensis\\"), \\"Paranthropinae\\" (P. robustus and \\"P. crassidens\\"), and \\"Archanthropinae\\" (\\"A. prometheus\\"). This scheme was widely criticised for being too liberal in demarcating species. Further, the remains were not firmly dated, and it was debated if there were indeed multiple hominin lineages or if there was only 1 leading to humans. Most prominently, Broom and South African palaeontologist John Talbot Robinson continued arguing for the validity of Paranthropus. Anthropologists Sherwood Washburn and Bruce D. Patterson were the first to recommend synonymising Paranthropus with Australopithecus in 1951, wanting to limit hominin genera to only that and Homo, and it has since been debated whether or not Paranthropus is a junior synonym of Australopithecus. In the spirit of tightening splitting criteria for hominin taxa, in 1954, Robinson suggested demoting \\"P. crassidens\\" to subspecies level as \\"P. r. crassidens\\", and also moved the Indonesian Meganthropus into the genus as \\"P. palaeojavanicus\\". Meganthropus has since been variously reclassified as a synonym of the Asian Homo erectus, \\"Pithecanthropus dubius\\", Pongo (orangutans), and so on, and in 2019 it was again argued to be a valid genus. By the 21st century, \\"P. crassidens\\" had more or less fallen out of use in favour of P. robustus. American palaeoanthropologist Frederick E. Grine is the primary proponent against synonymisation. In 1939, Broom hypothesised that Paranthropus was closely related to the similarly large-toothed ape Gigantopithecus from Asia (extinct apes were primarily known from Asia at the time) believing Gigantopithecus to have been a hominin. Primarily influenced by the mid-century opinions of Jewish German anthropologist Franz Weidenreich and German-Dutch palaeontologist Ralph von Koenigswald that Gigantopithecus was, respectively, the direct ancestor of the Asian H. erectus or closely related, much debate followed over whether or not Gigantopithecus was a hominin or if it was a non-human ape. In 1972, Robinson suggested including Gigantopithecus into \\"Paranthropinae\\", with the Miocene Pakistani \\"G. bilaspurensis\\" (now Indopithecus) as the ancestor of Paranthropus and the Chinese G. blacki. He also believed that they both had a massive build, contrasting this with a very small build for A. africanus (which he referred to as \\"H. africanus\\") and supposed cultural and hunting ability in the earliest human lineages which \\"paranthropines\\" lacked. With the popularisation of cladistics by the late 1970s to 1980s, and better resolution on how Miocene apes relate to later apes, Gigantopithecus was entirely removed from Homininae, and is now placed in the subfamily Ponginae with orangutans. In 1949, also in Swartkrans Cave, Broom and Robinson found a mandible which they preliminary described as \\"intermediate between one of the ape-men and true man,\\" classifying it as a new genus and species \\"Telanthropus capensis\\". Most immediate reactions favoured synonymising \\"T. capensis\\" with \\"P. crassidens\\" whose remains were already abundantly found in the cave. In 1957, though, Italian biologist Alberto Simonetta moved it to the genus \\"Pithecanthropus\\", and Robinson (without a specific reason why) decided to synonymise it with H. erectus (African H. erectus are sometimes called H. ergaster today), though it is unclear if this classification is completely sound. Reconstruction of OH 5, the holotype specimen of P. boisei In 1959, another and much more robust australopithecine was discovered in East Africa, P. boisei, and in 1975, the P. boisei skull KNM-ER 406 was demonstrated to have been contemporaneous with the H. ergaster/H. erectus skull KNM ER 3733 (which is considered a human ancestor). This is generally taken to show that Paranthropus was a sister taxon to Homo, both developing from some Australopithecus species, which at the time only included A. africanus. In 1979, a year after describing A. afarensis from East Africa, anthropologists Donald Johanson and Tim D. White suggested that A. afarensis was instead the last common ancestor between Homo and Paranthropus, and A. africanus was the earliest member of the Paranthropus lineage or at least was ancestral to P. robustus, because A. africanus inhabited South Africa before P. robustus, and A. afarensis was at the time the oldest known hominin species at roughly 3.5 million years old. Now, the earliest known South African australopithecine (\\"Little Foot\\") dates to 3.67 million years ago, contemporaneous with A. afarensis. The matter is still debated. It was long assumed (by those that believe Paranthropus is valid) that P. robustus was the ancestor of P. boisei, but the assignment of the 2.5 million year old East African skull KNM WT 17000 to the genus as P. aethiopicus in 1985 invalidated such a model. Instead, P. robustus and P. boisei evolved many robust features independently, and they were proposed to have both evolved from P. aethiopicus assuming Paranthropus is valid. =Setting= P. robustus was only definitively identified at Kromdraai and Swartkrans until around the turn of the century when the species was reported elsewhere in the Cradle of Humankind in Sterkfontein, Gondolin, Coopers, and Drimolen Caves. At Swartkrans, P. robustus has been identified from Members 1‚Äì3. Homo is also found in these deposits, but species identification in Members 1 and 2 is debated between H. ergaster/H. erectus, H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, or multiple species. In total, over 300 P. robustus specimens representing over 130 individuals, predominantly isolated teeth, have been recovered from Swartkrans. Member 1 and Member 3 have several mammal species in common, making dating by animal remains (biostratigraphy) yield overlapping time intervals. Like the East African Olduvai Bed I (2.03‚Äì1.75 million years ago) and Lower Bed II (1.75‚Äì1.70 million years ago), Member 1 preserved the antelope Parmularius angusticornis, the wildebeest, and the Cape buffalo. The presence of the Hamadryas baboon and Dinopithecus could mean Members 1‚Äì3 were deposited 1.9‚Äì1.65 million years ago, though the presence of warthogs suggests some sections of the deposits could date to after 1.5 million years ago. Uranium‚Äìlead dating reports intervals of 3.21‚Äì0.45 million years ago for Member 1 (a very large error range), 1.65‚Äì1.07 million years ago for Member 2, and 1.04‚Äì0.62 million years ago for Member 3, though more likely the younger side of the estimate; this could mean P. robustus outlived P. boisei. At Sterkfontein, only the specimens StW 566 and StW 569 are firmly assigned to the species, coming from the \\"Oldowan infill\\" dating to 2‚Äì1.7 million years ago in a section of Member 5. Earlier members yielded A. africanus. In 1988, palaeoanthropologist Ronald J. Clarke suggested StW 505 from the earlier Member 4 was an ancestor to P. robustus. The specimen is still generally assigned to A. africanus, though the Sterkfontein hominins are known to have an exceedingly wide range of variation, and it is debated whether or not the materials represent multiple species instead of just A. africanus. The appearance of the baboon Theropithecus oswaldi, zebras, lions, ostriches, springhares, and several grazing antelope in Member 5 indicates the predominance of open grasslands, but sediment analysis indicates the cave opening was moist during deposition, which could point to a well-watered wooded grassland. At Kromdraai, P. robustus has been unearthed at Kromdraai B, and almost all P. robustus fossils discovered in the cave have been recovered from Member 3 (out of 5 members). A total of 31 specimens representing at least 17 individuals have been recovered. The only potential Homo specimen fro Member 3 is KB 5223, but its classification is debated. The animals remains of Kromdraai A suggest deposition occurred anywhere between 1.89 and 1.63 million years ago, and the presence of Oldowan or Achulean tools indicates early Homo activity. The dating of Kromdraai B is less clear as there are no animal species which are known to have existed in a narrow time interval, and many non-hominin specimens have not been assigned to a species (left at genus level). Palaeomagnatism suggests Member 3 may date to 1.78‚Äì1.6 million years ago, Member 2 to before 1.78 million years ago, and Member 1 to 2.11‚Äì1.95 million years ago. At least 17 P. robustus individuals have been recovered from Kromdraai B. About 75% of other mammalian remains are monkeys, including leaf-eating colobine monkeys, the possibly the earliest record of the Hamadryas baboon, Gorgopithecus, and Papio angusticeps in South Africa. The absence of the baboons T. oswaldi and Dinopithecus could potentially mean Member 3 is older than Sterkfontein Member 5 and Swartkrans Member 1; which, if correct, would invalidate the results from palaeomagnetism, and make these specimens among the oldest representatives of the species. The ear of the juvenile KB 6067 from Member 3 is consistent with that of P. robustus, but the dimensions of the cochlea and oval window better align with the more ancient StW 53 from Sterkfontein Member 4 with undetermined species designation. KB 6067, therefore, may possibly be basal to (more ancient than) other P. robustus specimens, at least those for which ear morphology is known. GDA-2 from Gondolin Cave Gondolin Cave has yielded 3 hominin specimens: a right third premolar assigned to early Homo (G14018), a partial left gracile australopithecine 1st or 2nd molar (GDA-1), and a robust australopithecine 2nd molar (GDA-2). The first hominin specimen (G14018) was found by German palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba in 1979, and the other two specimens were recovered in 1997 by respectively South African palaeoanthropologist Andre Keyser and excavator L. Dihasu. GDA-2‚Äîmeasuring , an area of ‚Äîis exceptionally large for P. robustus, which has a recorded maximum of , falling within the range of P. boisei . So, the discoverers assigned it to Paranthropus species indeterminate rather than P. robustus. GDA-2 was found alongside the pig Metridiochoerus andrewsi, which means the tooth must be 1.9‚Äì1.5 million years old. Using this and palaeomagnetism, it may date to roughly 1.8 million years ago. Coopers Cave was first reported to yield P. robustus remains in 2000 by South African palaeoanthropologists Christine Steininger and Lee Rogers Berger at the annual American Association of Physical Anthropologists. Specimens include a crushed partial right face (COB 101), 3 isolated teeth, a juvenile jawbone, and several skull fragments. The animal remains in the hominin- bearing deposit are similar to those of Swartkrans and Kromdraai A, so the Coopers Cave deposits may date to 1.87‚Äì1.56 million years ago. Drimolen Cave was first discovered to have yielded hominin remains by Keyser in 1992, who, in 8 years, oversaw the recovery of 79 P. robustus specimens. Among these is the most complete P. robustus skull, DNH-7, preserving an articulated jawbone with almost all the teeth. The site is thought to be roughly 2‚Äì1.5 million years old based on animal remains which have also been recovered from Swartkrans Member 1. The animal assemblage is broadly similar to that of Coopers Cave, meaning they probably are about the same age. In 2020, DNH 152 was palaeomagnetically dated to 2.04‚Äì1.95 million years ago, making it the oldest confirmed P. robustus specimen. It was also associated with the H. ergaster/H. erectus skull DNH 134. =Classification= The genus Paranthropus (otherwise known as \\"robust australopithecines\\") now also includes the East African P. boisei and P. aethiopicus. It is still debated if this is a valid natural grouping (monophyletic) or an invalid grouping of similar-looking hominins (paraphyletic). Because skeletal elements are so limited in these species, their affinities with each other and to other australopithecines is difficult to gauge with accuracy. The jaws are the main argument for monophyly, but such anatomy is strongly influenced by diet and environment, and could in all likelihood have evolved independently in P. robustus and P. boisei. Proponents of monophyly consider P. aethiopicus to be ancestral to the other two species, or closely related to the ancestor. Proponents of paraphyly allocate these three species to the genus Australopithecus as A. boisei, A. aethiopicus, and A. robustus. Arguments for which species is more closely related to which are based on how one draws the hominin family tree, and the exact classification of Australopithecus species with each other is quite contentious. Anatomy =Skull= Typical of Paranthropus, P. robustus exhibits post-canine megadontia with enormous cheek teeth but human-sized incisors and canines. The premolars are shaped like molars. P. robustus had a tall face with slight prognathism (the face was not completely flat). The skull had a well-defined sagittal crest on the midline and inflated cheek bones, which likely supported massive temporal muscles important in biting. The cheeks project so far from the face that, when in top-view, the nose appears to sit at the bottom of a concavity (a dished face). This displaced the eye sockets forward somewhat, causing a weak brow ridge and receding forehead. The inflated cheeks also would have pushed the masseter muscle (important in biting down) forward and pushed the tooth rows back, which would have created a higher bite force on the premolars. The ramus of the jawbone, which connects the lower jaw to the upper jaw, is tall, which would have increased lever arm (and thereby, torque) of the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles (both important in biting down), further increasing bite force. However, the well-defined sagittal crest and inflated cheeks are absent in the presumed-female skull DNH-7, so Keyser suggested that male P. robustus may have been more heavily built than females (P. robustus was sexually dimorphic). Upon species description, Broom estimated the fragmentary braincase of TM 1517 as 600 cc, and he, along with South African anthropologist Gerrit Willem Hendrik Schepers, revised this to 575‚Äì680 cc in 1946. A year later, British primatologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark commented that, since only a part of the temporal bone on 1 side is known, brain volume cannot be accurately measured for this specimen. In 2001, Polish anthropologist Katarzyna Kaszycka said that Broom quite often artificially inflated brain size in early hominins, and the true value was probably much lower. In 1972, American physical anthropologist Ralph Holloway measured the skullcap SK 1585, which is missing part of the frontal bone, and reported a volume of about 530 cc. He also noted that, compared to other australopithecines, Paranthropus seems to have had an expanded cerebellum like Homo, echoing what Phillip V. Tobias said while studying P. boisei skulls in 1967. In 2000, American neuroanthropologist Dean Falk and colleagues filled in frontal bone anatomy of SK 1585 using the P. boisei specimens KNM-ER 407, OH 5, and KNM-ER 732, and recalculated the brain volume to about 476 cc. They stated overall brain anatomy of P. robustus was more like that of non-human apes. The posterior semicircular canals in the inner ear of SK 46 and SK 47 are unlike those of Australopithecus or Homo, suggesting different locomotory patterns since inner ear anatomy affects the vestibular system (sense of balance). The posterior semicircular canals of modern humans are thought to aid in stabilisation while running. In 1983, while studying SK 1585 (P. robustus) and KNM-ER 407 (P. boisei, which he referred to as robustus), French anthropologist Roger Saban stated that the parietal branch of the middle meningeal artery originated from the posterior branch in P. robustus and P. boisei instead of the anterior branch as in earlier hominins, and considered this a derived characteristic due to increased brain capacity. It has since been demonstrated that, at least for P. boisei, the parietal branch could originate from either the anterior or posterior branches, sometimes both in a single specimen on opposite sides of the skull. Regarding the dural venous sinuses, in 1983, Falk and anthropologist Glenn Conroy suggested that, unlike A. africanus or modern humans, all Paranthropus (and A. afarensis) had expanded occipital and marginal (around the foramen magnum) sinuses, completely supplanting the transverse and sigmoid sinuses. They suggested the setup would have increased blood flow to the internal vertebral venous plexuses or internal jugular vein, and was thus related to the reorganisation of the blood vessels supplying the head as an immediate response to bipedalism, which relaxed as bipedalism became more developed. In 1988, Falk and Tobias demonstrated that early hominins (at least A. africanus and P. boisei) could have both an occipital/marginal and transverse/sigmoid systems concurrently or on opposite halves of the skull. =Size= Reconstruction of the female DNH 7 Broom had noted that the ankle bone and humerus of the holotype TM 1517 were about the same dimensions of that of a modern San woman, and so assumed humanlike proportions in P. robustus. In 1972, Robinson estimated Paranthropus as having been massive. He calculated the humerus-to- femur ratio of P. robustus by using the presumed female humerus of STS 7 and comparing it with the presumed male femur of STS 14. He also had to estimate the length of the humerus using the femur assuming a similar degree of sexual dimorphism between P. robustus and humans. Comparing the ratio to humans, he concluded that P. robustus was a heavily-built species with a height of and a weight of . Consequently, Robinson had described its locomotory habits as, \\"a compromise between erectness and facility for quadrupedal climbing.\\" In contrast, he estimated A. africanus (which he called \\"H. africanus\\") to have been tall and in weight, and to have also been completely bipedal. This was soon challenged in 1974 by American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould and English palaeoanthropologist David Pilbeam, who guessed from the available skeletal elements a much lighter weight of about . Similarly, in 1988, American anthropologist Henry McHenry reported much lighter weights as well as notable sexual dimorphism for Paranthropus. McHenry measured the area of the cross section of the femoral head and scaled the dimensions of a modern human and an ape to such a cross-sectional area and noted the size. He then took the average of these 2 estimates. Based on SK 82 and SK SK 97, he reported an average weight of for P. robustus. In 1991, McHenry expanded his sample size, and also estimated the living size of Swartkrans specimens by scaling down the dimensions of an average modern human to meet a preserved leg or foot element (he considered the arm measurements too variable among hominins to give accurate estimates). At Members 1 and 2, about 35% of the P. robustus leg or foot specimens were the same size as those in a human, 22% in a human, and the remaining 43% bigger than the former but less than a human except for KNM‚ÄêER 1464 (an ankle bone). At Member 3, all individuals were consistent with a human. P. robustus sites are oddly dominated by small adults, which could be explained as heightened predation or mortality of the larger males of a group. McHenry also estimated the living height of 3 P. robustus specimens (male SK 82, male SK 97, and female or subadult SK 3155), by scaling down an average human to meet the estimated size of the preserved femur, as , , and respectively. Based on just these three, he reported an average height of for P. robustus males and for females. In 2001, palaeoanthropologist Randall L. Susman and colleagues, using two recently discovered proximal femoral fragments from Swartkrans, estimated an average of for males and for females. If these four proximal femur specimens‚ÄîSK 82, SK 97, SKW 19, and SK 3121‚Äîare representative of the entire species, they said that this degree of sexual dimorphism is greater than what is exhibited in humans and chimps, but less than orangutans and gorillas. Female P. robustus were about the same estimated weight as female H. ergaster/H. erectus in Swartkrans, but they estimated male H. ergaster/H. erectus as much bigger at . In 2012, American anthropologist Trenton Holliday, using the same equation as McHenry on 3 specimens, reported an average of with a range of . In 2015, biological anthropologist Mark Grabowski and colleagues, using 9 specimens, estimated an average of for males and for females. =Torso= Few vertebrae are assigned to P. robustus. The only thoracolumbar series (thoracic and lumbar series) preserved belongs to the juvenile SKW 14002, and either represents L1‚ÄìL4 or L2‚ÄìL5. SK 3981 preserves a T12 (last thoracic vertebra), and a lower lumbar vertebra. The T12 is relatively elongated, and the articular surface (where it joins with another vertebra) is kidney-shaped. The T12 is more compressed in height than that of other australopithecines and modern apes. Modern humans which suffer from spinal disc herniation often have vertebrae that are more similar to those of chimps than healthy humans. Early hominin vertebrae are similar to those of a pathological human, including the only other T12 known for P. robustus, the juvenile SK 853. Conversely, SK 3981 is more similar to those of healthy humans, which could be explained as: SK 3981 is abnormal, the vertebrae took on a more humanlike condition with maturity, or 1 of these specimens is assigned to the wrong species. The shape of the lumbar vertebrae is much more similar to that of Turkana boy (H. ergaster/H. erectus) and humans than other australopithecines. The pedicles (which jut out diagonally from the vertebra) of the lower lumbar vertebra are much more robust than other australopithecines and are within the range of humans, and the transverse processes indicate powerful iliolumbar ligaments. These could have bearing on the amount of time spent upright compared to other australopithecines. Illustration of DNH 43 (front view) The pelvis is similar to the pelvises of A. africanus and A. afarensis, but it has a wider iliac blade and smaller acetabulum and hip joint. Like modern humans, the ilium of P. robustus features development of the surface and thickening of the posterior superior iliac spine, which are important in stabilising the sacrum, and indicates lumbar lordosis (curvature of the lumbar vertebrae) and thus bipedalism. The anatomy of the sacrum and the first lumbar vertebra (at least the vertebral arch), preserved in DNH 43, are similar to those of other australopithecines. The pelvis seems to indicate a more-or-less humanlike hip joint consistent with bipedalism, though differences in overall pelvic anatomy may indicate P. robustus used different muscles to generate force and perhaps had a different mechanism to direct force up the spine. This is similar to the condition seen in A. africanus. This could potentially indicate the lower limbs had a wider range of motion than modern humans. =Limbs= The distal (lower) humerus of P. robustus falls within the variation of both modern humans and chimps, as the distal humerus is quite similar between humans and chimps. The radius of P. robustus is the same as in Australopithecus species. The wrist joint has the same manoeuverability as that of modern humans rather than the greater flexion achieved by non-human apes, but the head of radius (the elbow) seems to have been quite capable of maintaining stability when the forearm is flexed like non-human apes. It is possible this reflects some arboreal activity in the trees as is controversially postulated in other australopithecines. SKX 3602 exhibits robust radial styloid processes near the hand which indicate strong brachioradialis muscles and extensor retinaculae. Like humans, the finger bones are uncurved and have weaker muscle attachment than non-human apes, though the proximal phalanges are smaller than in humans. The intermediate phalanges are stout and straight like humans, but have stouter bases and better developed flexor impressions. The distal phalanges seem to be essentially humanlike. These could indicate a decreased climbing capacity compared to non-human apes and P. boisei. The P. robustus hand is consistent with a humanlike precision grip which would have made possible the production or usage of tools requiring greater motor functions than non-human primate tools. The femur, like P. boisei and H. habilis, is flattened anteroposteriorly (on the front and back side). This may indicate a walking gait more similar to early hominins than to modern humans (less efficient gait). Four femora assigned to P. robustus‚ÄîSK 19, SK 82, SK 97, and SK 3121‚Äîexhibit an apparently high anisotropic trabecular bone (at the hip joint) structure, which could indicate reduced mobility of the hip joint compared to non-human apes, and the ability to produce forces consistent with humanlike bipedalism. The femoral head StW 311, which either belongs to P. robustus or early Homo, seems to have habitually been placed in highly flexed positions, which would be consistent with frequent climbing activity. It is unclear if frequent squatting could be a valid alternative interpretation. The textural complexity of the kneecap SKX 1084, which reflects cartilage thickness and thus usage of the knee joint and bipedality, is midway between modern humans and chimps. The big toe bone of P. robustus is not dextrous, which indicates a humanlike foot posture and range of motion, but the more distal ankle joint would have inhibited the modern human toe-off gait cycle. P. robustus and H. habilis may have achieved about the same grade of bipedality. Palaeobiology =Diet= Cast of SK 46 In 1954, Robinson suggested that the heavily built skull of P. robustus and resultantly exorbitant bite force was indicative of a specialist diet specifically adapted for processing a narrow band of foods. Because of this, the predominant model of Paranthropus extinction for the latter half of the 20th century was that they were unable to adapt to the volatile climate of the Pleistocene, unlike the much more adaptable Homo. Subsequent researchers furthered this model that Paranthropus ate only hard foods studying the musculature of the face, dental wearing patterns, and primate ecology. In 1981, English anthropologist Alan Walker, while studying the P. boisei skulls KNM-ER 406 and 729, pointed out that bite force is a measure of not only the total pressure exerted but also the surface area of the tooth over which the pressure is being exerted, and Paranthropus teeth are 4‚Äì5 times the size of modern human teeth. Because the chewing muscles are arranged the same way, Walker postulated that the heavy build was instead an adaptation to chew a large quantity of food at the same time. He also found the microwearing on 20 P. boisei molar specimens were indistinguishable from patterning recorded in mandrills, chimps, and orangutans. Despite subsequent arguments that Paranthropus were not specialist feeders, the predominant consensus in favour of Robinson's initial model did not change for the remainder of the 20th century. In 2004, in their review of Paranthropus dietary literature, anthropologists Bernard Wood and David Strait concluded that Paranthropus were most definitely generalist feeders, and that P. robustus was an omnivore. They found that the microwear patterns in P. robustus suggest hard food was infrequently consumed, and therefore the heavy build of the skull was only relevant when eating less desirable fallback foods. Such a strategy is similar to that used by modern gorillas, which can sustain themselves entirely on lower quality fallback foods year-round, as opposed to lighter built chimps (and presumably gracile australopithecines) which require steady access to high quality foods. In 1980, anthropologists Tom Hatley and John Kappelman suggested that early hominins (convergently with bears and pigs) adapted to eating abrasive and calorie-rich underground storage organs (USOs), such as roots and tubers. Since then, hominin exploitation of USOs has gained more support. In 2005, biological anthropologists Greg Laden and Richard Wrangham proposed that Paranthropus relied on USOs as a fallback or possibly primary food source, and noted that there may be a correlation between high USO abundance and hominin occupation. A 2006 carbon isotope analysis suggested that P. robustus subsisted on mainly C4 savanna plants or C3 forest plants depending on the season, which could indicate either seasonal shifts in diet or seasonal migration from forest to savanna. H. ergaster/H. erectus appears to have consumed about the same proportion of C3 to C4 based foods as P. robustus. P. robustus likely also consumed seeds based on tooth chipping patterns. A high cavity rate could indicate honey consumption. Juvenile P. robustus may have relied more on tubers than adults, given the elevated levels of strontium compared to adults in teeth from Swartkrans Cave, which, in the area, was most likely sourced from tubers. Dentin exposure on juvenile teeth could indicate early weaning, or a more abrasive diet than adults which wore away the cementum and enamel coatings, or both. It is also possible juveniles were instead less capable of removing grit from dug-up food rather than purposefully seeking out more abrasive foods. =Technology= Australopithecine bone technology was first proposed by Dart in the 1950s with the now-disproven \\"osteodontokeratic culture\\", which he attributed to A. africanus at Makapansgat dating to 3‚Äì2.6 million years ago. The first probable bone tool was reported by Robinson in 1959 at Sterkfontein Member 5. Excavations led by South African palaeontologist Charles Kimberlin Brain at Swartkrans in the late 1980s and early 1990s recovered 84 similar bone tools, and excavations led by Keyser at Drimolen recovered 23. These tools were all found alongside Acheulean stone tools, except for those from Swartkrans Member 1 which bore Oldowan stone tools. Thus, there are 108 bone tool specimens from the region in total, and possibly an additional 2 from Kromdraai B. Bone tools are most abundant when P. robustus remains far outnumber Homo remains and stone tools, so they are often attributed to P. robustus. The 2 stone tools (either \\"Developed Oldowan\\" or \\"Early Acheulean\\") from Kromdraai B could possibly be attributed to P. robustus, as Homo has not been confidently identified in this layer; however, it is possible that the stone tools were reworked. Bone tools may have been used to cut or process vegetation, process fruits (namely marula fruit), strip tree bark, or dig up tubers or termites. The form of P. robustus incisors appears to be intermediate between H. erectus and modern humans, which could possibly mean it did not have to regularly bite off mouthfuls of a large food item due to preparation with simple tools. The bone tools were typically sourced from the shaft of long bones from medium- to large-sized mammals, but tools sourced from mandibles, ribs, and horn cores have also been found. They were not manufactured or purposefully shaped for a task. However, since the bones display no weathering, and there is a preference displayed for certain bones, raw materials were likely specifically hand picked. This contrasts with East African bone tools which appear to have been modified and directly cut into specific shapes before using. In 1988, Brain and South African archaeologist A. Sillent analysed the 59,488 bone fragments from Swartkrans Member 3, and found that 270 had been burnt, mainly belonging to medium-sized antelope, but also zebra, warthog, baboon, and P. robustus. They were found across the entire depth of Member 3, so fire was a regular event throughout its deposition. Based on colour and structural changes, they found that 46 were heated to below , 52 to , 45 to , and 127 above this. They concluded that these bones were, \\"the earliest direct evidence of fire use in the fossil record,\\" and compared the temperatures with those achieved by experimental campfires burning white stinkwood which commonly grows near the cave. Though some bones had cut marks consistent with butchery, they said it was also possible hominins were making fire to scare away predators or for warmth instead of cooking. However, the bones were not burnt inside the cave, and it is alternatively possible that the bones were naturally burnt in cyclically occurring wildfires (dry savanna grass as well as possible guano or plant accumulation in the cave may have left it susceptible to such a scenario), and then washed into what would become Member 3. The now-earliest claim of fire usage is 1.7 million years ago at Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, made by South African archaeologist Peter Beaumont in 2011. =Social structure= Given the marked anatomical and physical differences with modern great apes, there may be no modern analogue for australopithecine societies, so comparisons drawn with modern primates are highly speculative. A 2007 study pointed out that P. robustus appears to have had pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males notably larger than females. This is commonly correlated with a male-dominated polygamous society, such as the harem society of modern forest-dwelling silverback gorillas where one male has exclusive breeding rights to a group of females. Estimated male-female size disparity in P. robustus is comparable to gorillas (based on facial dimensions), and younger males were less robust than older males (delayed maturity is also exhibited in gorillas). Because the majority of sexed P. robustus specimens are male (or at least presumed male), males seem to have had a higher mortality rate than females. In a harem society, males are more likely to be evicted from the group given higher male‚Äìmale competition over females, and lone males may have been put at a higher risk of predation. By this hypothesis, a female moving out of her birth group may have spent little time alone and transferred immediately to another established group. Hamadryas baboon troop at Dierenpark Emmen with several males However, a 2011 strontium isotope study of P. robustus teeth from the dolomite Sterkfontein Valley found that, like other hominins, but unlike other great apes, P. robustus females were more likely to leave their place of birth (patrilocal). This discounts the plausibility of a harem society, which would have resulted in a matrilocal society due to heightened male‚Äìmale competition. Males did not seem to have ventured very far from the valley, which could either indicate small home ranges, or that they preferred dolomitic landscapes due to perhaps cave abundance or factors related to vegetation growth. Similarly, a 2016 study rebutted that, among primates, delayed maturity is also exhibited in the rhesus monkey which has a multi-male society, and may not be an accurate indicator of social structure. If P. robustus preferred a savanna habitat, a multi-male society would have been more conducive in defending the troop from predators in the more exposed environment, much like savanna baboons. Even in a multi-male society, it is still possible that males were more likely to be evicted, explaining male-skewed mortality with the same mechanism. A 2017 study postulated that, because male non-human great apes have a larger sagittal crest than females (particularly gorillas and orangutans), the crest may be influenced by sexual selection in addition to supporting chewing muscles. Further, the size of the sagittal crest (and the gluteus muscles) in male western lowland gorillas has been correlated with reproductive success. They extended their interpretation of the crest to the males of Paranthropus species, with the crest and resultantly larger head (at least in P. boisei) being used for some kind of display. This contrasts with other primates which flash the typically engorged canines in agonistic display (the canines of Paranthropus are comparatively small). However, it is also possible that male gorillas and orangutans require larger temporalis muscles to achieve a wider gape to better display the canines. =Development= SKX 11 tooth Australopithecines are generally considered to have had a faster, apelike growth rate than modern humans largely due to dental development trends. Broadly speaking, the emergence of the first permanent molar in early hominins has been variously estimated anywhere from 2.5‚Äì4.5 years, which all contrast markedly with the modern human average of 5.8 years. The 1st permanent molar of SK 63, which may have died at 3.4‚Äì3.7 years of age, possibly erupted at 2.9‚Äì3.2 years. In modern apes (including humans), dental development trajectory is strongly correlated with life history and overall growth rate, but it is possible that early hominins simply had a faster dental trajectory but a slower life history due to environmental factors, such as early weaning age as is exemplified in modern indriid lemurs. In TM 1517, fusion of the elements of the distal humerus (at the elbow) joint occurred before the fusion of the elements in the distal big toe phalanx, much like in chimps and bonobos, but unlike humans, which could also indicate an apelike growth trajectory. While growing, the front part of the jaw in P. robustus is depository whereas the sides are resorptive. For comparison, chimp jaws are generally depository reflecting prognathism, and modern humans resorptive reflecting a flat face. In Paranthropus, this may have functioned to thicken the palate. Unlike apes and gracile australopithecines, but like humans, the premaxillary suture between the premaxilla and the maxilla (on the palate) formed early in development. At early stages, the P. robustus jawbone is somewhat similar to that of modern humans, but the breadth grows in P. robustus, as to be expected from its incredible robustness in adulthood. By the time the first permanent molar erupts, the body of the mandible and the front jaw broaden, and the ramus of the mandible elongates, diverging from the modern human trajectory. Because the ramus is so tall, it is suggested that P. robustus experienced more anterior face rotation than modern humans and apes. Growth is most marked between the eruptions of the first and second permanent molars, most notably in terms of the distance from the back of the mouth to the front of the mouth, probably to make room for the massive postcanine teeth. Like humans, jaw robustness decreases with age, though it decreases slower in P. robustus. Regardless if P. robustus followed a human or non-human ape dental development timeframe, the premolars and molars would have had an accelerated growth rate to achieve their massive size. In contrast, the presence of perikymata on the incisors and canines (growth lines which typically are worn away after eruption) could indicate these teeth had a reduced growth rate. The tooth roots of P. robustus molars may have grown at a faster rate than gracile australopithecines; the root length of SK 62's 1st molar, which was reaching emergence from the dental alveolus, is about . This is more similar to gorillas whose roots typically measure when emerging from the gums (a later stage of dental development) whereas other hominins typically are under . Females may have reached skeletal maturity by the time the third molar erupted, but males appear to have continued growing after reaching dental maturity, during which time they become markedly more robust than females (sexual bimaturism). Similarly, male gorillas complete dental development about the same time as females, but continue growing for up to 5 or 6 years; and male mandrills complete dental development before females, but continue growing for several years more. It is debated whether or not P. robustus had a defined growth spurt in terms of overall height during adolescence, an event unique to humans among modern apes. In 1968, American anthropologist Alan Mann, using dental maturity, stratified P. robustus specimens from Swartkrans into different ages, and found an average of 17.2 years at death (they did not necessarily die from old age), and the oldest specimen was 30‚Äì35 years old. He also reported an average of 22.2 years for A. africanus. Using these, he argued these hominins had a humanlike prolonged childhood. In response, in 1971, biologist Kelton McKinley repeated Mann's process with more specimens, and (including P. boisei) reported an average of 18 years. McKinley agreed with Mann that P. robustus may have had a prolonged childhood. McKinley also speculated that sexual maturity was reached approximately 11 years because it is about halfway between the averages for chimps (9 years) and humans (13). Based on this, he concluded babies were birthed at intervals of 3 to 4 years using a statistical test to maximise children born. In 1972, after estimating a fetal size of based on an adult female weight of , anthropologist Walter Leutenegger estimated fetal head size at about , similar to a chimp. In 1973, using this and an equation between fetal head size and gestation (assuming foetal growth rate of 0.6 for all mammals), biologist John Frazer estimated a gestation of 300 days for P. robustus. In response, Leutenegger pointed out that apes have highly variable foetal growth rates, and \\"estimates on gestation periods based on this rate and birth weight are useless.\\" In 1985, British biologists Paul H. Harvey and Tim Clutton-Brock came up with equations relating body size to life history events for primates, which McHenry applied to australopithecines in 1994. For P. robustus, he reported neonate brain size of 175 cc and weight of , gestation 7.6 months, weaning after 30.1 months of age, maturation age 9.7 years, breeding age 11.4 years, birth interval 45 months, and lifespan 43.3 years. These roughly aligned with other australopithecines and chimps. However, for chimps, he got strongly inaccurate results when compared to actual data for neonate brain size, weaning age, and birth interval; and for humans all metrics except birth interval. =Pathology= The left upper 1st molar of SK 57 with tertiary dentin (white arrow) Based on a sample of 402 teeth, P. robustus seems to have had a low incidence rate of about 12‚Äì16% for tertiary dentin, which forms to repair tooth damage caused by excessive wearing or dental cavities. This is similar to what was found for A. africanus and H. naledi (which all inhabited the Cradle of Humankind at different points in time). In contrast, chimps have an incidence rate of 47%, and gorillas as much as 90%, probably due to a diet with a much higher content of tough plants. P. robustus seems to have had notably high rates of pitting enamel hypoplasia (PEH), where tooth enamel formation is spotty instead of mostly uniform. In P. robustus, about 47% of baby teeth and 14% of adult teeth were affected, in comparison to about 6.7% and 4.3% respectively for the combined teeth of A. africanus, A. sediba, early Homo, and H. naledi. The condition of these holes covering the entire tooth is consistent with the modern human ailment amelogenesis imperfecta. However, since circular holes in enamel coverage are uniform in size, only present on the molar teeth, and have the same severity across individuals, the PEH may have been a genetic condition. It is possible that the coding region concerned with thickening enamel also increased the risk of developing PEH. As many as four P. robustus individuals have been identified as having had dental cavities, indicating a rate similar to non-agricultural modern humans (1‚Äì5%). This is odd as P. robustus is thought to have had a diet high in gritty foods, and gritty foods should decrease cavity incidence rate, so P. robustus may have often consumed high- sugar cavity-causing foods. PEH may have also increased susceptibility to cavities. A molar from Drimolen showed a cavity on the tooth root, a rare occurrence in fossil great apes. In order for cavity-creating bacteria to reach this area, the individual would have had to have also presented either alveolar resportion, which is commonly associated with gum disease; or super- eruption of the tooth which occurs when it becomes worn down and has to erupt a bit more in order to maintain a proper bite, exposing the root in the process. The latter is most likely, and the exposed root seems to have caused hypercementosis to anchor the tooth in place. The cavity seems to have been healing, possibly due to a change in diet or mouth microbiome, or the loss of the adjacent molar. In a sample of 15 P. robustus specimens, all of them exhibited mild to moderate alveolar bone loss resulting from periodontal disease (the wearing away of the bone which supports the teeth due to gum disease). In contrast, in a sample of 10 A. africanus specimens, three exhibited no pathologies of the alveolar bone. Measuring the distance between the alveolar bone and the cementoenamel junction, P. robustus possibly suffered from a higher rate of tooth-attachment loss, unless P. robustus had a higher cervical height (the slightly narrowed area where the crown meets the root) in which case these two species had the same rate of tooth-attachment loss. If the former is correct, then the difference may be due to different dietary habits, chewing strategies, more pathogenic mouth microflora in P. robustus, or some immunological difference which made P. robustus somewhat more susceptible to gum disease. While removing the matrix encapsulating TM 1517, Schepers noted a large rock, which would have weighed , which had driven itself into the braincase through the parietal bone; he considered this evidence that another individual had killed TM 1517 by launching the rock as a projectile in either defense or attack. However, the most parsimonious explanation is that the rock was deposited during the fossilisation process after TM 1517 had died. In 1961, science writer Robert Ardrey noted two small holes about 2.5 cm (an inch) apart on the child skullcap SK 54, and believed this individual had been killed by being struck twice on the head in an assault; in 1970, Brain reinterpreted this as evidence of a leopard attack. Palaeoecology The Pleistocene Cradle of Humankind was mainly dominated by the springbok Antidorcas recki, but other antelope, giraffes, and elephants were also seemingly abundant megafauna. The carnivore assemblage comprises the sabertoothed cats Dinofelis and Megantereon, and the hyena Lycyaenops silberbergi. Overall, the animal assemblage of the region broadly indicates a mixed, open-to-closed landscape featuring perhaps montane grasslands and shrublands. Australopithecines and early Homo likely preferred cooler conditions than later Homo, as there are no australopithecine sites that were below in elevation at the time of deposition. This would mean that, like chimps, they often inhabited areas with an average diurnal temperature of , dropping to at night. SK 54 skullcap Australopithecine bones may have accumulated in caves due to large carnivore activity, dragging in carcasses, which was first explored in detail in 1983 by Brain. The juvenile P. robustus skullcap SK 54 has two puncture marks consistent with the lower canines of the leopard specimen SK 349 from the same deposits. Brain hypothesised that Dinofelis and perhaps also hunting hyenas specialised on killing australopithecines. However, carbon isotope analysis indicates these species predominantly ate large grazers, and the leopard, the sabertoothed Megantereon, and the spotted hyena were more likely to have regularly consumed P. robustus. Brain was unsure if these predators actively sought them out and brought them back to the cave den to eat, or inhabited deeper recesses of caves and ambushed them when they entered. Baboons in this region modern day often shelter in sinkholes especially on cold winter nights, though Brain proposed that australopithecines seasonally migrated out of the Highveld and into the warmer Bushveld, only taking up cave shelters in spring and autumn. As an antipredator behaviour, baboons often associated themselves with medium- to-large herbivores, most notably with impalas, and it is possible that P. robustus as well as other early hominins which lived in open environments did so also given they are typically associated with an abundance of medium-to- large bovid and horse remains. P. robustus also cohabited the Cradle of Humankind with H. ergaster/H. erectus. In addition, these two species resided alongside A. sediba which is known from about 2 million years ago at Malapa. The most recent A. africanus specimen, Sts 5, dates to about 2.07 million years ago, around the arrival of P. robustus and H. erectus. It has been debated whether or not P. robustus would have had symbiotic, neutral, or antagonist relations with contemporary Australopithecus and Homo. It is possible that South Africa was a refugium for Australopithecus until about 2 million years ago with the beginning of major climatic variability and volatility, and potentially competition with Homo and Paranthropus. Though P. robustus was a rather hardy species with a tolerance for environmental variability, it seems to have preferred wooded environments, and similarly most P. robustus remains date to a wet period in South Africa 2‚Äì1.75 million years ago conducive to such biomes. The extinction of P. robustus coincides with the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, and the doubling of glacial cycle duration. During glacial events, with more ice locked up at the poles, the tropical rain belt contracted towards the equator, subsequently causing the retreat of wetland and woodland environments. Before the transition, P. robustus populations possibly contracted to certain wooded refuge zones over 21,000 year cycles, becoming regionally extinct in certain areas until the wet cycle whereupon it would repopulate those zones. The continual prolonging of dry cycles may have caused its extinction, with the last occurrence in the fossil record 1‚Äì0.6 million years ago (though more likely 0.9 million years ago). Homo possibly was able to survive due to the great geographical range. However, the geographical range of P. robustus in the fossil record is roughly , whereas the critically endangered eastern gorilla (with the smallest range of any African ape) inhabits , the critically endangered western gorilla , and the endangered chimp . Therefore, fossil distribution very unlikely represents the true range of the species; consequently, P. robustus possibly went extinct much more recently somewhere other than the Cradle of Humankind (Signor‚ÄìLipps effect).

The holotype specimen, OH 5, was discovered by palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey in 1959, and described by her husband Louis a month later. It was originally placed into its own genus as \\"Zinjanthropus boisei\\", but is now relegated to Paranthropus along with other robust australopithecines. However, it is argued that Paranthropus is an invalid grouping and synonymous with Australopithecus, so the species is also often classified as Australopithecus boisei. Robust australopithecines are characterised by heavily built skulls capable of producing high stresses and bite forces, and some of the largest molars with the thickest enamel of any known ape. P. boisei is the most robust of this group. Brain size was about , similar to other australopithecines. Some skulls are markedly smaller than others, which is taken as evidence of sexual dimorphism where females are much smaller than males, though body size is difficult to estimate given only one specimen, OH 80, definitely provides any bodily elements. The presumed male OH 80 may have been tall and in weight (assuming improbable humanlike proportions), and the presumed female KNM-ER 1500 tall (though its species designation is unclear). The arm and hand bones of OH 80 and KNM-ER 47000 suggest P. boisei was arboreal to a degree and was possibly capable of manufacturing tools. P. boisei was originally believed to have been a specialist of hard foods, such as nuts, due to its heavily built skull, but it was more likely a generalist feeder of predominantly abrasive C4 plants, such as grasses or underground storage organs. Like gorillas, the apparently specialised adaptations of the skull may have only been used with less desirable fallback foods, allowing P. boisei to inhabit a wider range of habitats than gracile australopithecines. P. boisei may have been able to make Oldowan stone tools and butcher carcasses. P. boisei mainly inhabited wet, wooded environments, and coexisted with H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, H. ergaster, and H. erectus. These were likely preyed upon by the large carnivores of the time, including big cats, crocodiles, and hyenas. Taxonomy =Research history= Map of Paranthropus finds (P. boisei in red) The first remains‚ÄîOlduvai Hominin (OH) 3, a baby canine and large molar tooth‚Äîwere unearthed in 1955 in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. On July 17, 1959, palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey discovered a skull without a jaw, OH 5. The remains were clearly australopithecine (not the genus Homo), and at the time, the only australopithecine genera described were Australopithecus by Raymond Dart and Paranthropus (the South African P. robustus) by Robert Broom, and there were arguments that Paranthropus was synonymous with Australopithecus. Palaeoanthropologist Louis Leakey (Mary's husband) believed the skull had a mix of traits from both genera, briefly listing 20 differences, and so used OH 5 as the basis for the new genus and species \\"Zinjanthropus boisei\\" on August 15, 1959. The genus name derives from the medieval term for East Africa, \\"Zanj\\", and the species name was in honour of Charles Watson Boise, the Leakeys' benefactor. Soon after OH 5's discovery, Louis presented \\"Z. boisei\\" to the 4th Pan-African Congress on Prehistory in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1960, American anthropologist John Talbot Robinson pointed out that the supposed differences are due to OH 5 being slightly larger than P. robustus, and so recommended the species be reclassified as P. boisei. Louis rejected Robinson's argument. Following this, it was debated if P. boisei was simply an East African variant of P. robustus until 1967 when South African palaeoanthropologist Phillip V. Tobias gave a far more detailed description of OH 5 in a monograph (edited by Louis). However, they still retained Zinjanthropus and recommended demoting it to subgenus level as Australopithecus (Zinjanthropus) boisei, considering Paranthropus to be synonymous with Australopithecus. Synonymising Paranthropus with Australopithecus was first suggested by anthropologists Sherwood Washburn and Bruce D. Patterson in 1951, who recommended limiting hominin genera to only Australopithecus and Homo. By the time OH 5 was discovered, the Leakey's had spent 24 years excavating the area for early hominin remains, but had instead recovered mainly other animal remains as well as the Oldowan stone tool industry. Because OH 5 was associated with the tools and processed animal bones, they presumed it to have been the toolmaker. Attribution of the tools was promptly switched to the bigger-brained H. habilis upon its description in 1964. In 1965, OH 5 was dated to 1.75 million years ago based on potassium- argon dating of anortoclase crystals from an overlying tuff (volcanic ash) bed. Various P. boisei specimens The first identified jawbone, Peninj 1, was discovered Lake Natron just north of Olduvai Gorge in 1964. Especially from 1966‚Äì1975, several more specimens revealing facial elements were reported from the Shungura Formation, Ethiopia; Koobi Fora and Chesowanja, Kenya; and Omo and Konso, Ethiopia. Among the notable specimens found include the well preserved skull KNM-ER 406 from Koobi Fora in 1970. In 1997, the first specimen with both the skull and jawbone (and also one of the largest specimens), KGA10-525, was discovered in Konso. In 1999, a jawbone was recovered from Malema, Malawi, extending the species' southernmost range over from Olduvai Gorge. The first definitive bodily elements of P. boisei associated with facial elements, OH 80 (isolated teeth with an arm and a leg), were discovered in 2013. Previously, body remains lacking unambiguous diagnostic skull elements had been dubiously assigned to the species, namely the partial skeleton KNM-ER 1500 associated with a small jawbone fragment. OH 80 was also associated with Oldowan stone tools. In 2015, based on OH 80, American palaeoanthropologist Michael Lague recommended assigning the isolated humerus specimens KNM-ER 739, 1504, 6020, and 1591 from Koobi Fora to P. boisei. In 2020, the first associated hand bones were reported, KNM-ER 47000 (which also includes a nearly complete arm), from Ileret, Kenya. =Classification= The genus Paranthropus (otherwise known as \\"robust australopithecines\\") typically includes P. boisei, P. aethiopicus, and P. robustus. It is debated if Paranthropus is a valid natural grouping (monophyletic) or an invalid grouping of similar-looking hominins (paraphyletic). Because skeletal elements are so limited in these species, their affinities with each other and to other australopithecines is difficult to gauge with accuracy. The jaws are the main argument for monophyly, but such anatomy is strongly influenced by diet and environment, and could in all likelihood have evolved independently in P. boisei and P. robustus. Proponents of monophyly consider P. aethiopicus to be ancestral to the other two species, or closely related to the ancestor. Proponents of paraphyly allocate these three species to the genus Australopithecus as A. boisei, A. aethiopicus, and A. robustus. Before P. boisei was described (and P. robustus was the only member of Paranthropus), Broom and Robinson continued arguing that P. robustus and A. africanus (the then only known australopithecines) were two distinct lineages. However, remains were not firmly dated, and it was debated if there were indeed multiple hominin lineages or if there was only 1 leading to humans. In 1975, the P. boisei skull KNM-ER 406 was demonstrated to have been contemporaneous with the H. ergaster skull KNM ER 3733, which is generally taken to show that Paranthropus was a sister taxon to Homo, both developing from some Australopithecus species, which at the time only included A. africanus. In 1979, a year after describing A. afarensis from East Africa, anthropologists Donald Johanson and Tim D. White suggested that A. afarensis was instead the last common ancestor between Homo and Paranthropus, and A. africanus was the earliest member of the Paranthropus lineage or at least was ancestral to P. robustus, because A. africanus inhabited South Africa before P. robustus, and A. afarensis was at the time the oldest known hominin species at roughly 3.5 million years old. Now, the earliest known South African australopithecine (\\"Little Foot\\") dates to 3.67 million years ago, contemporaneous with A. afarensis. Such arguments are based on how one draws the hominin family tree, and the exact classification of Australopithecus species with each other is quite contentious. For example, if the South African A. sediba (which evolved from A. africanus) is considered the ancestor or closely related to the ancestor of Homo, then this could allow for A. africanus to be placed more closely related to Homo than to Paranthropus. This would leave the Ethiopian A. garhi as the ancestor of P. aethiopicus instead of A. africanus (assuming Paranthropus is monophyletic, and that P. aethiopicus evolved at a time in East Africa when only A. garhi existed there). Because P. boisei and P. aethiopicus are both known from East Africa and P. aethiopicus is only confidently identified from the skull KNM WT 17000 and a few jaws and isolated teeth, it is debated if P. aethiopicus should be subsumed under P. boisei or if the differences stemming from archaicness justifies species distinction. The terms P. boisei sensu lato (\\"in the broad sense\\") and P. boisei sensu stricto (\\"in the strict sense\\") can be used to respectively include and exclude P. aethiopicus from P. boisei when discussing the lineage as a whole. P. aethiopicus is the earliest member of the genus, with the oldest remains, from the Ethiopian Omo Kibish Formation, dated to 2.6 million years ago (mya) at the end of the Pliocene. It is possible that P. aethiopicus evolved even earlier, up to 3.3 mya, on the expansive Kenyan floodplains of the time. The oldest P. boisei remains date to about 2.3 mya from Malema. The youngest record of P. boisei comes Olduvai Gorge (OH 80) about 1.34 mya; however, due a large gap in the hominin fossil record, P. boisei may have persisted until 1 mya. P. boisei changed remarkably little over its nearly 1 million year existence. Anatomy P. boisei bust at the Hall of Human Origins, Washington DC, by John Gurche P. boisei is the most robust of the robust australopithecines, whereas the South African P. robustus is smaller with comparatively more gracile features. The P. boisei skull is heavily built, and features a defined brow ridge, receding forehead, rounded bottom margins of the eye sockets, inflated and concave cheek bones, a thick palate, and a robust and deep jawbone. This is generally interpreted as having allowed P. boisei to resist high stresses while chewing, though the thick palate could instead be a byproduct of facial lengthening. The skull features large rough patches (rugosities) on the cheek and jawbones, and males have pronounced sagittal (on the midline) and temporonuchal (on the back) crests, which indicate a massive masseter muscle (used in biting down) placed near the front of the head (increasing mechanical advantage). This is typically considered to be evidence of a high bite force. The enormous cheek teeth (postcanine megadontia) of both sexes would have increased the pressure applied to food. In the upper jaw, the 1st molar averages roughly , the 2nd molar , and the 3rd molar ; in the lower jaw, the 1st molar averages roughly , the 2nd molar , and the 3rd molar . The molars are bunodont, featuring low and rounded cusps. The premolars resemble molars (are molarised), which may indicate P. boisei required an extended chewing surface for processing a lot of food at the same time. The enamel on the cheek teeth are among the thickest of any known ape, which would help resist high stresses while biting. The incisors and canines are reduced, which would hinder biting off chunks of large food pieces. Peninj 1 showing postcanine megadontia In a sample of 10 P. boisei specimens, brain size varied from with an average of . However, the lower-end specimen, Omo L338‚Äêy6, is a juvenile, and many skull specimens have a highly damaged or missing frontal bone which can alter brain volume estimates. The brain volume of australopithecines generally ranged from , and for contemporary Homo . Regarding the dural venous sinuses, in 1983, American neuroanthropologist Dean Falk and anthropologist Glenn Conroy suggested that, unlike A. africanus or modern humans, all Paranthropus (and A. afarensis) had expanded occipital and marginal (around the foramen magnum) sinuses, completely supplanting the transverse and sigmoid sinuses. In 1988, Falk and Tobias demonstrated that hominins can have both an occipital/marginal and transverse/sigmoid systems concurrently or on opposite halves of the skull, such as with the P. boisei specimen KNM-ER 23000. In 1983, French anthropologist Roger Saban stated that the parietal branch of the middle meningeal artery originated from the posterior branch in P. boisei and P. robustus instead of the anterior branch as in earlier hominins, and considered this a derived characteristic due to increased brain capacity. It has since been demonstrated that the parietal branch could originate from either the anterior or posterior branches, sometimes both in a single specimen on opposite sides of the skull as in KNM-ER 23000 and OH 5. The wide range of size variation in skull specimens seems to indicate a great degree of sexual dimorphism with males being notably bigger than females. However, it is difficult to predict with accuracy the true dimensions of living males and females due to the lack of definitive P. boisei skeletal remains, save for the presumed male OH 80. Based on an approximation of for the femur before it was broken and using modern humanlike proportions (which is probably an unsafe assumption), OH 80 was about tall in life. For comparison, modern human men and women in the year 1900 averaged and , respectively. The femoral head, the best proxy for estimating body mass, is missing, but using the shaft, OH 80 weighed about assuming humanlike proportions, and using the proportions of a non-human ape. The ambiguously attributed, presumed female femur KNM-ER 1500 is estimated to have been about tall which would be consistent with the argument of sexual dimorphism, but if the specimen does indeed belong to P. boisei, it would show a limb anatomy quite similar to that of the contemporary H. habilis. OH 80 femoral shaft (left) and ulna (right) Scale bar= Instead, the OH 80 femur, more like H. erectus femora, is quite thick, features a laterally flattened shaft, and indicates similarly arranged gluteal, pectineal, and intertrochanteric lines around the hip joint. Nonetheless, the intertrochanteric line is much more defined in OH 80, the gluteal tuberosity is more towards the midline of the femur, and the mid-shaft in side-view is straighter, which likely reflect some difference in load- bearing capabilities of the leg. Unlike P. robustus, the arm bones of OH 80 are heavily built, and the elbow joint shows similarities to that of modern gibbons and orangutans. This could either indicate that P. boisei used a combination of terrestrial walking as well as suspensory behaviour, or was completely bipedal but retained an ape-like upper body condition from some ancestor species due to a lack of selection to lose them. In contrast, the P. robustus hand is not consistent with climbing. The hand of KNM-ER 47000 shows Australopithecus-like anatomy lacking the third metacarpal styloid process (which allows the hand to lock into the wrist to exert more pressure), a weak thumb compared to modern humans, and curved phalanges (finger bones) which are typically interpreted as adaptations for climbing. Nonetheless, despite lacking a particularly forceful precision grip like Homo, the hand was still dextrous enough to handle and manufacture simple tools. Palaeobiology =Diet= In 1954, Robinson suggested that the heavily built skull of Paranthropus (at the time only including P. robustus) was indicative of a specialist diet specifically adapted for processing a narrow band of foods. Because of this, the predominant model of Paranthropus extinction for the latter half of the 20th century was that it was unable to adapt to the volatile climate of the Pleistocene, unlike the much more adaptable Homo. It was also once thought P. boisei cracked open nuts and similar hard foods with its powerful teeth, giving OH 5 the nickname \\"Nutcracker Man\\". However, in 1981, English anthropologist Alan Walker found that the microwearing patterns on the molars were inconsistent with a diet high in hard foods, and were effectively indistinguishable from the pattern seen in the molars of fruit- eating (frugivorous) mandrills, chimps, and orangutans. The microwearing on P. boisei molars is different than that on P. robustus molars, and indicates that P. boisei, unlike P. robustus, very rarely ever ate hard foods. Carbon isotope analyses report a diet of predominantly C4 plants, such as low quality and abrasive grasses and sedges. Thick enamel is consistent with grinding abrasive foods. The microwear patterns in P. robustus have been thoroughly examined, and suggest that the heavy build of the skull was only relevant when eating less desirable fallback foods. A similar scheme may have been in use by P. boisei. Such a strategy is similar to that used by modern gorillas, which can sustain themselves entirely on lower quality fallback foods year-round, as opposed to lighter built chimps (and presumably gracile australopithecines) which require steady access to high quality foods. Reconstruction of MGL 95211 skull and jaw In 1980, anthropologists Tom Hatley and John Kappelman suggested that early hominins (convergently with bears and pigs) adapted to eating abrasive and calorie-rich underground storage organs (USOs), such as roots and tubers. Since then, hominin exploitation of USOs has gained more support. In 2005, biological anthropologists Greg Laden and Richard Wrangham proposed that Paranthropus relied on USOs as a fallback or possibly primary food source, and noted that there may be a correlation between high USO abundance and hominin occupation. In this model, P. boisei may have been a generalist feeder with a predilection for USOs, and may have gone extinct due to an aridity trend and a resultant decline in USOs in tandem with increasing competition with baboons and Homo. Like modern forest chimps and baboons, australopithecines likely foraged for food in the cooler morning and evening instead of in the heat of the day. OH 80 was found associated with a mass of Oldowan stone tools and animal bones bearing evidence of butchery. This could potentially indicate P. boisei was manufacturing the Oldowan tradition and ate meat to some degree. =Social structure= In 1979, American biological anthropologist Noel T. Boaz noticed that the relative proportions between large mammal families at the Shungura Formation are quite similar to the proportion in modern day across sub-Saharan Africa. Boaz believed that hominins would have had about the same population density as other large mammals, which would equate to 0.006‚Äì1.7 individuals per square kilometre (0.4 square miles). Alternatively, by multiplying the density of either bovids, elephants, or hippos by the percentage of hominin remains out of total mammal remains found at the formation, Boaz estimated a density of 0.001‚Äì2.58 individuals per square kilometre. Biologist Robert A. Martin considered population models based on the number of known specimens to be flimsy. In 1981, Martin applied equations formulated by ecologists Alton S. Harestad and Fred L. Bunnel in 1979 to estimate the home range and population density of large mammals based on weight and diet, and, using a weight of , he got: and 0.769 individuals per square kilometre if herbivorous; and 0.077 individuals if omnivorous; and and 0.0004 individuals if carnivorous. Male (left) and female (right) western gorilla skulls A 2017 study postulated that, because male non-human great apes have a larger sagittal crest than females (particularly gorillas and orangutans), the crest may be influenced by sexual selection in addition to supporting chewing muscles. Further, the size of the sagittal crest (and the gluteus muscles) in male western lowland gorillas has been correlated with reproductive success. They extended their interpretation of the crest to the males of Paranthropus species, with the crest and resultantly larger head (at least in P. boisei) being used for some kind of display. This contrasts with other primates which flash the typically engorged canines in agonistic display (the canines of Paranthropus are comparatively small). However, it is also possible that male gorillas and orangutans require larger temporalis muscles to achieve a wider gape to better display the canines. =Development= Australopithecines are generally considered to have had a faster, apelike growth rate than modern humans largely due to dental development trends. Broadly speaking, the emergence of the first permanent molar in early hominins has been variously estimated anywhere from 2.5‚Äì4.5 years of age, which all contrast markedly with the modern human average of 5.8 years. The tips of the mesial cusps of the 1st molar (on the side closest to the premolar) of KNM-ER 1820 were at about the same level as the cervix (where the enamel meets the cementum) of its non-permanent 2nd premolar. In baboons, this stage occurs when the 1st molar is about to erupt from the gums. The tooth root is about , which is similar to most other hominins at this stage. In contrast, the root of the P. robustus specimen SK 62 was when emerging through the dental alveolus (an earlier stage of development than gum emergence), so, unless either specimen is abnormal, P. robustus may have had a higher tooth root formation rate. The specimen's 1st molar may have erupted 2‚Äì3 months before death, so possibly at 2.7‚Äì3.3 years of age. In modern apes (including humans), dental development trajectory is strongly correlated with life history and overall growth rate, but it is possible that early hominins simply had a faster dental trajectory but a slower life history due to environmental factors, such as early weaning age as is exemplified in modern indriid lemurs. Palaeoecology P. boisei remains have been found predominantly in what were wet, wooded environments, such as wetlands along lakes and rivers, wooded or arid shrublands, and semiarid woodlands, with the exception of the savanna- dominated Malawian Chiwondo Beds. During the Pleistocene, there seems to have been coastal and montane forests in Eastern Africa. More expansive river valleys‚Äìnamely the Omo River Valley‚Äìmay have served as important refuges for forest-dwelling creatures. Being cut off from the forests of Central Africa by a savanna corridor, these East African forests would have promoted high rates of endemism, especially during times of climatic volatility. Australopithecines and early Homo likely preferred cooler conditions than later Homo, as there are no australopithecine sites that were below in elevation at the time of deposition. This would mean that, like chimps, they often inhabited areas with an average diurnal temperature of , dropping to at night. P. boisei coexisted with H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, and H. ergaster / H. erectus, but it is unclear how they interacted. To explain why P. boisei was associated with Oldowan tools despite not being the tool maker, Louis Leakey and colleagues, when describing H. habilis in 1964, suggested that one possibility was P. boisei was killed by H. habilis, perhaps as food. However, when describing P. boisei 5 years earlier, he said, \\"There is no reason whatever, in this case, to believe that the skull [OH 5] represents the victim of a cannibalistic feast by some hypothetical more advanced type of man.\\" OH 80 seems to have been eaten by a big cat. The leg OH 35, which either belongs to P. boisei or H. habilis, shows evidence of leopard predation. Other likely Oldowan predators of great apes include the hunting hyaena Chasmaporthetes nitidula, the sabertoothed cats Dinofelis and Megantereon, and the crocodile Crocodylus anthropophagus.

In 627, at the time of the Battle of the Ditch, he converted to Islam and emigrated to Medina. Bloodwit case Rabi'ah's son Adam was a small child living with a foster-mother from the Bakr tribe. The Bakr were at war with the Hudhayl. Adam crept out in front of the tents and was caught in the cross-fire of the battle. A rock thrown by a Hudhayl man hit and crushed his head, which killed him. Rabi'ah intended to demand blood-money or a counter-killing from the Hudhayl for the death of his son. Before this could happen, Muhammad conquered Mecca.

From 1940-1941 he served under Jean de Lattre de Tassigny as chief of staff of the commander in chief of North Africa at the headquarters of Vichy French forces in Tunisia. In 1942 Carpentier joined General Charles de Gaulle's Free French forces, becoming chief of staff of the French Expeditionary Corps in 1943. He continued in this post until 1944, when he became Commander of the 2nd Moroccan Division, with which he served until 1945. After World War II he was in charge of France's 15 military regions and was appointed Commandant sup√©rieur of Tunisian Troops in 1946. He was made Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honor in 1947. In 1949 he was appointed commander-in-chief of French Union forces in Indochina, but in 1950 following the disastrous defeat in the Battle of Route Coloniale 4 he was replaced by de Lattre. Carpentier then returned to Europe to become chief of staff assigned to NATO in 1951, serving there until 1952. In 1956 he was appointed Inspector General of Infantry, eventually retiring as Commander in Chief of NATO for Central Europe.

Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts a Top 40 (CHR) format branded as 106.5 The End, and is one of two Top 40s in Entercom's Sacramento cluster, the other being Rhythmic Top 40 KSFM. Its studios are located in Foothill Farms (with a Sacramento address) and its transmitter is in Folsom. History =KJML= Origin The 106.5 frequency in Sacramento signed on in 1957 with the call letters KJML, which adopted a number of format changes before settling with the beautiful music format, commonly identified as \\"instrumental elevator music.\\" =KWOD= 1970s, Royce Broadcasting, AC/jazz format Royce International Broadcasting headed by Edward R. Stolz II acquired the station in 1977 dropping the beautiful music format in favor of a soft rock/jazz music hybrid with a change of call letters to KWOD, named after quadrophonic sound, as the station was one of the first to experiment with the technology that never caught on. The initial format was programmed by Kevin Childs, who created the method of transitioning from rock to jazz via what was called \\"The Crossroads of Jazz\\". With no advertising of promotion, KWOD succeeded in achieving a dedicated following across the Sacramento Valley. 1980s, Top 40 format In the late 1970s, Royce Broadcasting decided to drop the adult contemporary/jazz hybrid music format in favor of a Top 40 music format. By 1985, KWOD was the second rated station in the 12+ age demographic under the programming of Program Director Tommy \\"Tom\\" Chase and Music Director Edward \\"Mr. Ed\\" Lambert behind crosstown CHUrban powerhouse (and future sister station) FM 102. The popular morning show of this period was \\"The Doug Masters and Marty Johnson's Morning Radio Clinic Show\\" featuring Douglas \\"Doug\\" Masters and Martin \\"Marty\\" Johnson. Other jocks throughout the Tom Chase and Ed Lambert era included Dave Diamond, Dean Stevens, Dave Skyler, Paul Michaels, Gregory Lane, Melanie Evans, John Edwards, Panama Jack, Rick Foster, Russell \\"Russ\\" Martin, with Patrick \\"Pat The Night Hawk\\" Garrett, and Alexander Cosper. Tom left in late 1987 to program competitor KROY and Ed followed to become KROY's MD in early 1988. In 1988 KWOD becomes Power Hits KWOD 106, the morning show became \\"The Tom Sterling and Terry Steele Morning Show\\" featuring Program Director Jeff Hunter (Terry Steele) and Charlie Simons (Tom Sterling) following the resignation of Marty Johnson, Doug Masters moved to middays. The rest of the full-time line-up of this period included Johnny \\"Jammin'\\" Edwards in middays, Panama Jack in afternoons, with Pat \\"The Night Hawk\\" Garrett in evenings, and Alex Cosper in late nights. Other jocks included Bill \\"Wild Bill\\" Shakespeare, Vincent \\"Vince\\" Simon, Rick Neal, with Rick Foster, and Rexton \\"Rex\\" McNeill did weekend overnights and was responsible for cleaning the KWOD 106's Power van after late night station parties. Tom and Terry left in 1989 to do mornings in San Jose and were replaced by a temporary irreverent show that failed called the Renegades. 1990s, modern rock format Gerry Cagle arrived in late 1989 to oversee programming as Operations Manager. Ratings fell sharply beginning in 1988 (as documented in the Sacramento Bee) as KWOD fell into third place in a three-way battle with cross-town competitors KSFM and KROY. Even after KROY changed to The Eagle as a classic rock station, the ratings remained dismal leading to a change of format in May 1991 to a Top 40/modern rock music hybrid which evolved into a modern rock music format by June 1993.\\"KWOD makes a move to modern rock format\\", The Sacramento Bee, May 11, 1991. In 1992, Gerry Cagle was instrumental in changing the CHR music format in favor of full-time modern rock. This is documented in multiple trade publications. Axl Marley and the late Dan Kennedy excelled in AM Drive with the new Modern Rock format. The much later line-up included the morning team of Shawn Cash and Jeff Jensen followed by Cosper in mid-days, Brad Adams in afternoons and Nick Monroe nights. Later in 1993, Monroe moved to afternoons and Joe ‚ÄúWith You‚Äù Gomez moved to nights. Shortly after the move to their new headquarters in downtown Sacramento, part-time DJ Giles Hendriksen from the U.K. became the full-time afternoon host with Joe ‚ÄúWith You‚Äù Gomez staying in the evening slot. Jamie Gates took over the evening slot as well as programming both the \\"punk\\" and \\"industrial\\" music shows. Jamie stayed on until 1997 when new management took over. By this time, Ally Storm had already departed to work at Live 105 in San Francisco. The station reached its ratings peak as an alternative station in the summer of 1995 with a 5.2 (12+) share, making it one of the highest rated alternative stations in America at the time (as documented in the 12/9/95 issue of Billboard). It also beat all four other rock stations in the market. Ron Bunce assumed control of KWOD's programming in 1997, and took the station to an edgier harder rock direction, which peaked at 4.5 (12+) in the Arbitron ratings. 2000s, Entercom purchase, modern AC format thumb Throughout the 2000s KWOD stayed below a 3 share 12+, and was not competitive with rock station KRXQ. Over time, there was a lot of staff turnover. Morning personalities Shawn & Jeff left for KZZO in 2001 and were succeeded by Boomer and the Dave. Comedian Kelly Pryce eventually replaced Dave after KWOD's eventual sale to Entercom and the show later featured DJ Mervin and Ian Gary. Andy Sims also came on board in 2001 for middays, replacing Derek Moore, who later went on to 96.9 The Eagle. In 2003, after a protracted seven-year court battle wherein violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) were alleged, Entercom acquired KWOD from Royce International Broadcasting. Entercom left KWOD's Modern Rock/Alternative format intact until two years later. In Spring 2005, the Royce-era KWOD played its final song (\\"Nice to Know You\\" by Incubus) then started a two-week-long transition to a Modern AC/Light Alternative format with an auditory progress indicator between songs. Artists such as John Mayer and Tracy Chapman were added as harder rock bands like Korn and Deftones were dropped. The station re-branded itself \\"KWOD 2.0\\", and released the entire on-air staff. The station later shifted back toward its original approach, but the heritage KWOD on-air staff (Boomer & The Dave, Andy Sims, Nick Monroe, and Capone) did not return. Under Entercom's management, KWOD's overall 12+ ratings dropped under a 3 share throughout 2005 and 2006. In the Winter of 2007, KWOD's 12+ ratings fell below a 2 share. In early 2006, KWOD picked up the syndicated Adam Carolla Show for the morning drive, and began to feature projects and shows devised by the disc jockeys, including the returning David X and Andy Sims. KWOD also started to feature a strong program of music including a focus on modern punk and indie music complemented by a \\"Never More Than 2 Minutes of Commercials\\" campaign. Sunday mornings featured a show from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. called \\"Retro Revival\\" with David X as the host. In February 2009, following the cancellation of the syndicated Adam Carolla Show, the morning drive time slot transitioned into playing music. Closure In May 2009, Program Director Curtiss Johnson posted a notice on KWOD's homepage announcing that the station would be shutting down on May 22. Citing economic difficulties as the primary reason for the shutdown, Johnson assured that the decision was local and not made by the owner corporation Entercom. At the time of the closure, the on-air staff consisted of Andy Hawk, Andy Sims, Rubin, Mike D \\"Dezego\\", and Laith the Intern. The format change would leave Sacramento without a modern rock/alternative format station until March 3, 2010, when sister station KSSJ flipped from smooth jazz to a gold-based Alternative rock format, branded as \\"Radio 94.7.\\" Just before 9 a.m. on May 22, 2009, after playing Green Day's \\"21 Guns\\" and \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\" by Sacramento band Cake, KWOD signed off.106.5 KWOD Becomes All 90s \\"The Buzz\\" =KBZC= The Buzz logo, 2009-2011 At approximately 9 a.m. on May 22, 2009, the station became \\"106.5 The Buzz - Totally 90s\\", playing music exclusively from the 1990s, and using the call letters KBZC. The first song of the new \\"Buzz\\" format was Summertime by DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. It was the first terrestrial all-1990s radio station, and the third all-1990s radio station after XM's '90s on 9 (now also on Sirius 9 since November 12, 2008) and the short-lived I-90 channel on Sirius from 2002. KBZC advertised itself as playing \\"'90s and More\\", meaning that in addition to 1990s hits, they include some classics from previous decades in their playlists. It also aired pre- recorded short sayings with phrases and product references from the 1990s. In addition, the Snapple lady responded to questions submitted on the website. It was also reported in the Orange County Register in June 2009 that Jamie White would do a morning show starting on June 11, 2009.From The Orange County Register (June 11, 2009) White would leave the station on April 22, 2011. On September 2, 2011, at 5 p.m., after playing \\"I Wish\\" by Skee-Lo, KBZC dropped the All-'90s format and shifted to Rhythmic Adult Contemporary, retaining the \\"Buzz\\" moniker, but added a new slogan: \\"Feel Good Music.\\" The first song under the relaunch was \\"Don't Stop The Music\\" by Rihanna. The station faced competition from the market's already established Rhythmic AC, KHYL, and featured a playlist that consisted of Rhythmic Pop currents and recurrents. The sudden flip came after it saw a decline in both its listener base and ratings, as well as an ill-fated attempt to expand its library to include music from the late 1980s and early 2000s.\\"The Buzz Sacramento Revamps\\" from Radioinsight (September 2, 2011) Star logo, 2016-2017 Following the abrupt flip of Hot AC station KGBY to a simulcast of KFBK, Entercom flipped the format of KBZC to Hot AC as \\"Star 106.5\\" at noon on December 9, 2011, following an hour of songs signifying a \\"goodbye\\" theme and/or with the word \\"star\\" in the title. The first song on \\"Star\\" was \\"For the First Time\\" by The Script. The flip gave the market two Hot AC's, the other being CBS Radio's KZZO. On March 31, 2014, KBZC changed their call letters back to KWOD. However, as part of a warehousing move by Entercom, KWOD changed their call letters to KUDL on April 7. The KUDL call letters were formerly used on KWOD's long-time adult contemporary sister station in the Kansas City market. The KWOD call letters, in turn, moved to KUDL's former 1660 AM frequency in that market. =\\"The End\\" moves to 106.5= On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced its intent to merge with CBS Radio, who owned the fellow Sacramento AC and Adult CHR stations KYMX and KZZO, as well as KSFM, KNCI, and KHTK. The next day, Entercom announced that it would shut down KUDL's sister station KDND 107.9 The End, return its license to the FCC, and move KDND's intellectual property to KUDL. The FCC had declared the renewal of KDND's license to be subject to hearing, disputing whether the station had served the public interest; in 2007, a woman died from water intoxication resulting from her participation in a \\"Hold Your Wee for a Wii\\" contest held by the station's morning show. Entercom stated that this decision was intended \\"to facilitate the timely FCC approvals for the planned combination with CBS Radio\\". On February 6, 2017, KDND's contemporary hit radio format, programming, and branding were relocated to KUDL as 106.5 The End. The callsign, however, remained KUDL. The Entercom merger was completed on November 17, 2017; all of CBS Radio's existing stations in the market, except for KSFM (which now serves as a rhythmic contemporary companion to KUDL), were divested into a trust, and substantially acquired by Bonneville International in August 2018. Awards and honors * In 1993 and 2006 KWOD was named Station of the Year by Sac News & Review. It was also named Station of the Year in 1992 by the Sacramento Bee. KUDL-HD2 KUDL's HD2 subcarrier, called Subterranean, formerly aired a format featuring Deep Rock tracks and album cuts. As of February 22, 2017, KUDL-HD2 had been broadcasting Radio Disney until the end of May 2018, when Entercom's deal with Radio Disney expired. The channel now carries reruns of the station‚Äôs morning show The Wake Up Call.

He is perhaps most recognized for his roles as Sinbad in the syndicated television series The Adventures of Sinbad, and was a regular cast member on the ABC daytime drama All My Children as bad boy and rapist Braden Lavery. More recently he's appeared in Miller Lite's \\"Man Laws\\" commercials as one of the \\"Men Of The Square Table\\". Gesner also appeared on an episode of the popular sitcom Friends in which he played Rachel Green's date. A graduate of the prestigious London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), Gesner has appeared in several movies since his cinematic debut as \\"Dale's Man #1\\" in the 1994 comedy Dumb & Dumber, including Osmosis Jones (as Emergency Room Doctor #1), Me, Myself & Irene (Agent Peterson), Shallow Hal (Ralph), and There's Something About Mary (as a bartender). In 2005, he had a small part in the romantic comedy Fever Pitch starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon. Early life Gesner was born in Van Nuys, California, the son of stage actress Nan Martin and architect Harry Gesner.Zen Gesner Biography (1970‚Äì) His parents named him after the Japanese Buddhist sect that preaches enlightenment through meditation. He has an older half-brother, Casey Martin Dolan, from his mother's first marriage to musician Robert E. Dolan, and two older half- siblings from his father's prior marriages, Jason Gesner (Hydroelectric Manager), and Tara Tanzer-Cartwright (Teacher). Gesner was interested in music as a boy, and plays both the piano and trumpet. He became an aspiring actor while attending Santa Monica High School after landing a small part in the school's production of Hamlet, and went on to play leading roles in the school's rendition of \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" and \\"The Sound of Music\\". Upon graduation, Gesner joined South Coast Repertory Theatre in Orange County, CA, performing in small roles and watching experienced actors ply their craft. Career After touring the audition circuit, Gesner sought admission to LAMDA's intensive summer programme on Shakespeare and was accepted. Towards the end of the course, he was offered a position in the general three-year programme at the Academy, whose North American alumni include such actors as Alexis Denisof, John Lithgow and Donald Sutherland. As a student at LAMDA, Gesner not only performed in such plays as Richard III, The Cherry Orchard and Anything Goes, but also studied everything from poetry to archery to fire- blowing. He especially excelled in fencing and during his second year, earned an advanced certificate from The Society of British Fight Directors. Post- graduation from the Academy, the actor worked as Assistant Fight Director to the Royal Opera, London. Gesner made his feature film debut in Dumb & Dumber and put his real-life surfing skills to use as a surfer in the Chris Isaak music video, \\"Somebody's Crying\\". After four auditions and a screen test, Gesner won the title role in the syndicated fantasy-action series, The Adventures of Sinbad. The series was filmed in Cape Town, South Africa, and involved heavy stuntwork and use of special effects. Between shoots, Gesner added to his physical performance skills by picking up tricks from a local circus troupe, such as tightrope walking, inverted rope-climbing, kicking/flipping up from the ground (known as \\"kipping\\"), and stunt flips. Although listed on the fall lineup for a third season, the well-rated series ended its run after the second season due to contract disputes between the production company and series distributors. Since the conclusion of Sinbad in 1998, Gesner has appeared on television series such as Friends and All My Children. He played the role of David Patrick in the 2005 movie The Ringer, a film about the Special Olympics. He was also the spokesperson for Chicken Of The Sea's 2005 \\"What Women Want\\" marketing campaign. Gesner is brother-in-law to the Farrelly Brothers, and has received several small roles in their movies, including Dumb & Dumber, Fever Pitch, Kingpin, Me, Myself & Irene, Osmosis Jones, Shallow Hal and There's Something About Mary. Gesner also played (Ron) a gay man in the movie Boat Trip. He appeared in the Man Laws commercials for Miller Lite. Gesner was the \\"Mystery Man\\" in the opening of each episode of Take the Money & Run. He hands the briefcase containing $100,000 to the two-person team of contestants and relays instructions. Personal life Gesner moved back to the United States, where he met and married his wife Cynthia Farrelly Gesner (sister of the writer-directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly) in 1997. They moved to Hollywood, where Gesner worked part-time in construction while auditioning for television and movie roles. They have three sons: Finn Harry Gesner (b. July 24, 1997 in Cape Town, South Africa), Rory Farrelly Gesner (b. October 9, 2000 in Santa Monica, California, and Tuck John Gesner (b. July 11, 2003 in Santa Monica, California). Gesner currently resides with his family in Malibu, California.

He was born in Meedel, Moravia, and died in Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main). Life Schindler moved to Vienna in 1813 to study law, and from 1817 to 1822 was a clerk in a law office there. He was a competent, though not an exceptional violinist, and played in various musical ensembles, first meeting Beethoven in 1814. He gave up his law career, becoming in 1822 first violinist at the Theater in der Josefstadt, and from 1825 first violinist at the Theater am K√§rntnertor. His acquaintance with Beethoven continued, and from 1822, he lived in the composer's house, as his unpaid secretary.Paul Nettl. \\"Schindler, Anton Felix\\". Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York, 1956.Anton Schindler (1795‚Äì1864) ‚Äì Reproduktion einer Fotografie Beethoven- haus Bonn Digital Archives.

There was a break in the relationship in March 1825, and Karl Holz, a young violinist in the Schuppanzigh Quartet and friend of Beethoven, became Beethoven's secretary; though Schindler and Beethoven reconciled in August 1826, Holz continued as Beethoven's secretary with Schindler also tending to the composers' needs. After Beethoven's death in 1827, Schindler moved to Budapest where he was a music teacher, returning to Vienna in 1829. In 1831, he moved to M√ºnster where he was a musical director; from 1835 he lived in Aachen, where he was municipal music director until 1840. In 1840, his biography of Beethoven was published in M√ºnster. Later editions appeared in 1845, 1860 and 1871. In 1841‚Äì42 he visited Paris, and met famous musicians of the day. He possessed a great part of Beethoven's estate, in particular around 400 conversation books that people used to converse with Beethoven in his later years. Beethoven's estate, purchased by the Royal Prussian Library in Berlin in 1845, included 136 conversation books. Schindler retained the remainder, which were likely destroyed.Paul Nettl. \\"Conversation-books (Konversationshefte)\\". Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York, 1956.  Subsequent discredit and recent revival of credibility  Although the inconsistencies of Schindler's account of Beethoven's life were clear as early as the 1850s to lead Alexander Wheelock Thayer to commence research for his own pioneering Beethoven biography, it was a series of musicological articles published beginning in the 1970sSee Stadlen (1977), Goldschmidt (2013, p. 58, n. 138), Herre & Beck (1978), Beck & Herre (1979), Howell (1979), Newman (1984). that essentially destroyed Schindler's reputation of reliability. It was demonstrated that Schindler had falsified entries in Beethoven's Conversation Books (into which he inserted many spurious entries after the composer's death in 1827),See Tellenbach and that he had exaggerated his period of close association with Beethoven (his claimed '11 or 12 years' was probably no more than five or six). It is also believed that Schindler burned more than half of Beethoven's conversation books and removed countless pages from those that survived. The Beethoven Compendium (Cooper 1991, p. 52) goes so far as to say that Schindler's propensity for inaccuracy and fabrication was so great, virtually nothing he has written about Beethoven can be relied on unless it is supported by other evidence. More recently, Theodore Albrecht has re-examined the question of Schindler's reliability, and as to his presumed destruction of a huge number of conversation books, concludes that this widespread belief could possibly have been exaggerated.\\"In any case, it now becomes abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as circa 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number.\\" (Albrecht 2010) Although Anton Schindler forged documents and otherwise became notorious as an unreliable biographer and music historian, his accounts on Beethoven's style of performing his own piano works are indispensable sources. Dr. George Barth, in his book The Pianist as Orator (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1992) brings to light an approach to bringing the Beethoven keyboard literature to life, based on Schindler and his testimonies, quite different from the Carl Czerny accounts on Beethoven the world has accepted since Schindler's forgeries compromised the latter's credibility. Discrepancies in metronome markings by Czerny as well as accounts of Beethoven's own rhythm and tempo choices create a worthier image of Schindler's credibility in that regard, and his valuable perspective on interpretation of Beethoven's piano music.Barth, op. cit.  In film  Anton Schindler plays a central role in the highly fictionalized Beethoven film Immortal Beloved, in which Schindler attempts to discover the identity of the mysterious addressee of Beethoven's most famous love letter.

The park encompasses of parkland including Albert Park Lake () and provides numerous ovals, sporting facilities, the Albert Park Public Golf Course, a walking track around the lake, and the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit. It is bordered by Albert Road, Queens Road, Fitzroy Street and Canterbury Road. Surrounding suburbs include Albert Park, Middle Park, St Kilda, Melbourne and South Melbourne. History =Early history= Albert Park was originally part of the extensive Yarra River Delta, which involved vast areas of wetlands and sparse vegetation, interspersed by lagoons, some of which were quite large, including the lagoon from which Albert Park Lake was created. The area was occupied by localised tribes of Indigenous Australians, the Wurundjeri people, for around 40,000+ years prior to European settlement, and was one of many sites around Melbourne where regular corroborees (meetings) were held. =19th and 20th centuries= Following British settlement from 1835 onwards, much of the Yarra River delta was drained to dry the land and enable agriculture, housing and grazing. Through the 1840s and 1850s, the area now occupied by Albert Park itself was unofficial parkland, used for military training, grazing and hunting. In 1864 the area was officially proclaimed a public park and named Albert Park in honour of Queen Victoria's devoted consort, Prince Albert. By 1875, areas of the park along Queens Road and in St. Kilda, had been sold off for housing and other uses, reducing the park from 385 to 231 hectares. Through much of the late 19th Century, allotments were allocated for sporting facilities such as Football, Tennis, Bowling, Cricket and Boating. Between 1873 and 1880, silt in the lagoons was excavated and used as infill around the lagoon itself to create a permanent lake. In 1890, water was diverted from the Yarra River to help fill the lake. Through the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, the park was used as a tip, a camp for the armed services, scenic drives, picnics and many other forms of recreation. Map of Albert Park and Lake In 1882, 1918 and 1935, adjoining educational institutions acquired land from the park, to much opposition at the time. From 1941‚Äì1950, the Army occupied large areas of land in the park, this land was given back to the park during the 1950s and 1960s. From 1953‚Äì1958, motor racing was held within the park, including the 1953 and 1956 Australian Grands Prix was held within the park, around the lake, until it was moved to the circuit on Phillip Island. Through much of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, general park maintenance was neglected as funding became hard to come by, finances were collected from a carousel and similar facilities. =Recent years= During the early 1990s, the lake was drained to remove weed infestations, rubbish and other debris that had accumulated over the years. In 1993, it was announced that the Australian Grand Prix would be moved from the Adelaide Street Circuit to a reconstructed Albert Park Circuit, loosely following the 1950s configuration. This was met with much opposition, but the project went ahead and a host of sporting facilities were subsequently constructed and funding allocated to improve the parklands followed. Albert Park is enjoyed by approximately five million visitors annually. Vestiges of Albert Park's Aboriginal history still remain, the most noticeable being the large ancient River Red Gum Tree, reputed to be the site of many corroborees. It is thought to be over 300 years old, the oldest remnant tree in the Port Phillip area, located next to Junction Oval on the corner of Fitzroy Street and Queens Road, St Kilda. The Clarendon Street gates were originally built of wooden pickets in 1910, they were cast in wrought iron in 1939 and can still be seen today. Habitat and fauna Aughtie Drive (part of the Grand Prix track) looking east over Gunn Island toward 470 St Kilda Road, St Kilda (main reflection), in the St Kilda Road residential and office precinct The parkland, Albert Park lake, and Gunn Island, provides a grassy wetlands habitat for nearly two hundred bird species, both resident and transient. A 1990 study recorded 31 bird species as breeding in the park with a total of 21 these indigenous species. Migratory species include the flame robin, white- throated needletail and sacred kingfisher. Locally rare native bird species that have been recorded in the park include little egret, laughing kookaburra, Australian shelduck, Cape Barren goose, great-crested grebe, white-bellied sea eagle and whiskered tern, while little ravens, Australian magpies, long-billed corella, sulphur-crested cockatoo, willie wagtails and magpie-larks are common. Common lake birds include black swans and Pacific black ducks, Australasian grebe, Eurasian coots, purple swamphen, dusky moorhen and all four freshwater cormorant species. Feral white swans were removed from the park between the 1980s and 1990s. Feral common mynas and common starling are also numerous in the park. Native mammals include common brushtail possums, common ringtail possums and water rat. Common bent-wing bats, white-striped mastiff bats and Gould's wattled bat have also been recorded in the park. Feral black rats are also common in the park. Foxes have also been spotted on occasion at night. Several reptiles and amphibians, such as the marbled gecko make their home in the park. The lake is home to some freshwater fish species. The department of Primary Industries releases native golden perch for recreational fishing purposes. European carp, a noxious pest are the most commonly found fish in the lake and is subject to control programs. A vegetation survey in 1992 found 117 species of plants, a mixture of native and exotic species. A native revegetation area in the south east corner of the park features a large ancient river red gum tree known as the Corroboree Tree, a heritage registered eucalypt of cultural significance as a pre-European gathering place. Facilities and features Albert Park Lake, looking towards Melbourne There are nine separate picnic areas, most with barbecues, shelters and toilets. There is a vast network of sealed and unsealed, shared pedestrian/bicycle paths, centred on a main route that circles the lake. There are several playgrounds of varying sizes, the park also hosts many large sporting facilities, including: *Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre - International class swimming and sports facilities. *Lakeside Stadium - Home ground of Athletics Australia, Athletics Victoria and South Melbourne FC. *Albert Park Public Golf Course - including a golf driving range on the opposite side of the lake. *Junction Oval - historic sporting ground. *Several boating and sailing clubs - located on the north and eastern sides of the lake. *Several rowing clubs at either ends of the lake, specifically [2014] APSMRC [Albert Park South Melbourne], Caulfield Grammar School, Argonauts, YWCA, Korowa GS, Wesley College, Brighton Grammar School. *Restaurants and Function Centres - including the Powerhouse, the Point and Carousel. *Various sporting grounds/ovals - including Harry Trott Oval, Holdsworth Pavilion, Ross Gregory Oval, Stuart King Pavilion, Ian Johnson Oval, and several smaller bowls clubs, tennis clubs, cricket ovals, soccer and rugby fields located in the south western side of the park. =Other features= *Gunn Island - an artificial island. A second island at the southern end was removed by the military as a training exercise in the early 1950s. *The Aquatower - a large water spout/fountain, which is currently turned off due to water restrictions. Events The Australian Grand Prix is held around the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit around the lake in March each year; usually on the Labour Day weekend. Every May the RSPCA holds the Million Paws Walk to raise needed income for their work with animals. The Albert Sailing Club holds regular regattas on Saturdays. The Albert Park Yacht club, established in 1871 and the oldest continuing yacht club in Victoria, runs sailing classes over winter months on Albert Park lake and also has competitive sailing on Saturdays. Albert Park is home to a 5 km Parkrun event. Albert Melbourne Parkrun starts at 8am every Saturday from the Coot Picnic area.

It was founded in 1896.  History  In 1896, Wingate University began as 'The Wingate School,' a primary and secondary institution founded by the Baptist Associations of Union County, North Carolina and Chesterfield County, South Carolina in response to a dearth of locally-available public schools. The school took its name from Dr. Washington Manly Wingate, a former president of Wake Forest College, and continued to offer a primary and secondary education until the proliferation of public schools in the early 20th century. In 1923, The Wingate School began offering the first two years of a baccalaureate education and became Wingate Junior College. The years leading to World War II were difficult for the institution. Though it began receiving financial support from The Baptist State Convention of North Carolina soon after becoming a college, this support was withdrawn during The Great Depression. It was also during this period, in 1932, that the college's administration building was destroyed by fire. The college survived, however, as a result of the work of its administration, faculty, and supporters as well as the post-WWII college enrollment boom. The Baptist State Convention resumed financial support in 1949, and Charles Cannon, a local businessman and philanthropist, began making substantial donations to the college beginning in the 1950s. In 1952, Wingate Junior College was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and in 1977, became a four-year institution, Wingate College. The college continued to grow, especially under the leadership of Jerry McGee, added graduate programs, and became Wingate University in 1995.  Academics  Wingate offers 35 undergraduate majors, 10 pre-professional programs and 38 minors. The university offers five types of bachelor‚Äôs degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Music Education and Bachelor of Liberal Studies. Three add-on licensure programs in the field of education are available as are six master‚Äôs degree programs: accounting, business, education, teaching, physician assistant studies and sport management. Wingate offers four doctoral degree programs: education, pharmacy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. One-in-five Wingate undergraduate students is preparing to be a pharmacist, physician assistant, physical therapist, occupational therapist or nurse and 65 percent of graduate students are enrolled in health sciences. =Pharmacy= The Wingate University School of Pharmacy () is a pharmacy school located in Wingate, North Carolina. The school, part of Wingate University, offers a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy degree (Pharm.D) and is nationally accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. As of 2017, tied with 6 other programs, it was ranked #81 among pharmacy colleges in the US.U.S. News & World Report 2017 Best Pharmacy Programs  US News Rankings Page accessed 11 November 2017 = Study abroad = Started in 1978, the university's W'International program allows eligible juniors to take a two-credit-hour seminar, which ends with a 10-day travel experience for $1,500 or less. Wingate also offers language-immersion summer programs in Costa Rica and Quebec.  Athletics  Wingate student-athletes compete in 22 NCAA Division II sports. These sports include: baseball, softball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track & field, men's and women's lacrosse, football and volleyball.

A subsidiary of the EMI conglomerate, the corporate name was not used throughout the entire period of EMI's involvement in the film industry, from 1969 to 1986, but the company's brief connection with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Anglo-EMI, the division under Nat Cohen, and the later company as part of the Thorn EMI conglomerate (following the merger with Thorn) are outlined here. History =Headed by Bryan Forbes= The company was formed after the takeover of Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1969 by EMI, following the acquisition of Warner Bros.' shares in ABPC the previous year. At the time ABPC owned 270 ABC Cinemas, a half share in the ITV contractor Thames Television, Elstree Studios at Shenley Road, and had recently bought Anglo-Amalgamated, a film studio in which Nat Cohen had been a partner. EMI moved into film production with the foundation of a new company, EMI-Elstree. Bernard Delfont appointed writer-director Bryan Forbes as the head of production at Elstree in April 1969 for three years at ¬£40,000 a year, plus a percentage of the profits.Forbes, p 62 As part of the general shake up of EMI, Nat Cohen was appointed to the Board. EMI announced they would make 28 films for $36 million ‚Äì 13 of these would be from Cohen's unit for ¬£7 million, the rest from Forbes'. Bernard Delfont called it \\"probably the most ambitious program ever undertaken by a British film company.\\" Forbes announced his intention to make a variety of films at Elstree, steering away from what he called the \\"pornography of violence.\\"Walker, 1974, p.426-428 He claimed EMI would make 14 films in 18 months with such stars as Peter Sellers and Roger Moore at a cost of ¬£5‚Äì10 million in total. His aim was to keep budgets down and create a varied slate which would increase the chances of appealing to audiences and making a sufficient return to continue productions. Forbes soon announced his slate of projects, including: *Hoffman (with Peter Sellers, directed by Alvin Rakoff), *The Go-Between directed by Joseph Losey, *The Breaking of Bumbo directed by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo, *The Feathers of Death directed by Richard Attenborough from a story by Simon Raven (unproduced),Forbes, p.103 *a film of a script by Richard Condon, *an adaptation of The Railway Children directed by Lionel Jeffries, *A Fine and Private Place, directed by Paul Watson *Dulcima directed by Frank Nesbitt with John Mills, *Forbrush and the Penguins. \\"This is the first serious effort to revitalize the British film industry in 20 years\\", said Forbes. He added, \\"We intend to give youth a chance and not merely pay lip service to it. This is our first program and it won't be our last.\\" However, the first few films of Forbes' regime actually performed poorly commercially: Eyewitness, Hoffmann, And Soon the Darkness and The Man Who Haunted Himself (starring Moore). The Breaking of Bumbo (all 1970), and Mr. Forbush and the Penguins (1971) flopped and A Fine and Private Place was abandoned. Forbes clashed with Bernard Delfont and their American backers, in this case Columbia, over the artistic and commercial value of director Joseph Losey's film The Go-Between (1970). Forbes was also criticised within EMI for directing his own film, The Raging Moon (US: Long Ago, Tomorrow, 1971). The Railway Children (1970) and Tales of Beatrix Potter (1971) were Forbes' only hits. The company was affected with labour problems. Forbes felt as though he did not have the support of the EMI board, arguing that he never had the funds to market his films, in contrast with those available to Anglo-EMI, which was headed by Nat Cohen. Forbes resigned in March 1971, after committing himself to a no-redundancy policy. He had made eleven films in total for an estimated cost of ¬£4 million.Walker, 1985, p 114 Although Forbes' regime was seen at the time to have been a commercial failure, he later claimed that by 1993 his ¬£4 million program of films had eventually brought EMI a profit of ¬£16 million.Forbes, p.108 Among the films Forbes wished to make but was unable to during his time at Elstree were adaptations of The Living Room, the play by Graham Greene to be directed by Michael Powell;Forbes, p.102 a musical about the Bernado Boys; and The Loud, Loud Silence a post-apocalyptic story from Richard Condon. He turned down Ned Kelly (1970) because its projected budget was too high. =MGM-EMI= In April 1970, EMI struck up a co-production agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The Hollywood studio announced they would sell their Borehamwood facility (\\"MGM- British Studios\\") and move their equipment to EMI's Elstree studio. MGM and EMI would then distribute and produce films in co-operation through a joint venture to be called MGM-EMI.Sian Barber The British Film Industry in the 1970s: Capital, Culture and Creativity, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, p.47 and MGM began to finance some of EMI's productions. EMI's studio complex was renamed EMI-MGM Elstree StudiosPatricia Warren British Film Studios: An Illustrated History, London: B.T Batsford, 2001, p.76 while a film distribution company MGM-EMI Distributors Ltd. was formed as part of the co- production agreement. This company, headed by Mike Havas would handle domestic distribution of MGM and EMI-produced films in the United Kingdom. It was originally announced that MGM-EMI would make six to eight films a year, but they ended up producing far fewer. Forbes was given the title of managing director of MGM-EMI to add to his existing title of head of production. In July 1970 MGM-EMI announced they would make four co-productions: The Go- Between, Get Carter, The Boyfriend and The Last Run directed by John Boorman. Of these only the last was not made. MGM pulled out of the amalgamation in 1973, and became a member of CIC, which took over international distribution of MGM produced films. At this point the distribution company became EMI Film Distributors Ltd., and EMI-MGM Elstree Studios reverted to EMI-Elstree Studios. =Anglo-EMI Film Distributors= EMI's other filmmaking division, Anglo-EMI Film Distributors Ltd, which had come out of Anglo-Amalgamated, was run autonomously by Nat Cohen. This wing of the company had released films such as Percy (1971). They also financed and distributed a series of films made by Hammer Film Productions, which partly came about through Bernard Delfont's friendship with James Carreras. Nat Cohen took over Forbes' responsibilities as head of production after his resignation in 1971. Cohen backed productions intended for international success, and EMI had a more obviously commercial outlook.author=In October 1971, EMI's chairman John Read admitted the film division had performed disappointingly. \\"Profits were negligible last year and we felt it was desirable to make one or two provisions to write off some of the costs.\\" However films like On the Buses and Up Pompeii (both 1971) performed well in relation to their budgets. \\"The experts say you're doing well if you make money out of one in three films\\", said Read. \\"We see filmmaking as a significant profit earner in the future.\\" Cohen was responsible for overseeing about 70% of the films produced in the UK during 1973, following a significant decline in domestic projects overall. In particular, long-term duopoly rival Rank had by now greatly reduced its own investment in British film production to a token presence. Cohen was not unaware of the problems inherent in his dominant position.Barber, p.48 Meanwhile, dependent on support from the most profitable parts of EMI, the company's financial position meant that they had to avoid backing any risky productions. In May 1973, Cohen announced a ¬£3 million production slate of movies including an adaptation of Swallows and Amazons (1974) and a sequel to Alfie (1966) released as Alfie Darling (1975). The greatest success of Cohen's regime was Murder on the Orient Express (1974), which Cohen later claimed was the first British movie fully financed by a British company to reach the top of the American box office charts. In July 1975, Cohen announced a ¬£6 million programme of new films, including Seven Nights in Japan and To the Devil a Daughter (both 1976).Walker, 1985 p141 These were not particularly successful. Cohen resigned as chairman on 31 December 1977. =Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings= In May 1976, the company purchased British Lion Films and the two men who ran British Lion, Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings, became joint managing directors of EMI Distributors, with Nat Cohen remaining as chairman and chief executive. They also joined the EMI board, headed by Bernard Delfont. Deeley and Spiking's method was to only make a film if at least half the budget was put up by an American studio, reducing their financial risk although making the studio's product less obviously British. They focused on movies with international appeal ‚Äì i.e. action films ‚Äì and major stars.author=The initial Deeley-Spikings slate included three films shot in the US, with $18 million in all\\" The Deer Hunter, Convoy and The Driver (all 1978). They also made three British-based films, Death on the Nile (1978), Warlords of Atlantis (1978) and Sweeney 2 (1978).Deeley in his memoirs says the sixth film was Arabian Adventure. See Deeley p 134 Films announced by not made include The Last Gun and Chinese Bandit. EMI also signed an agreement to invest $5 million in Columbia films. They picked Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Deep and The Greatest (all 1977).Deeley p 134 Muhammad Ali played himself in the last of these. In July 1976 EMI bought Roger Gimbel's production company, Tomorrow Enterprises, and formed EMI Television, headed by Gimbel. They made a large number of American TV movies like The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977) and Deadman's Curve (1978). EMI backed out of funding Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) at the last moment, after Bernard Delfont read the script and objected to its treatment of religion. In April 1978, EMI announced they would make films with the newly formed Orion Pictures, including Arabian Adventure (1979) and other projects. Michael Deeley left EMI in 1979 but Barry Spikings remained in charge of film production. =Spikings, AFD and Thorn-EMI merger= Spikings announced a slate of films under his auspices: The Jazz Singer with Neil Diamond, The Elephant Man (both 1980), Honky Tonk Freeway (1981) Franco Zeffirelli's biopic of Maria Callas, Discoland, The Awakening, and The Knight directed by Ridley Scott. Delfont created a new company, Associated Film Distribution, to distribute films of EMI and ITC Entertainment, then controlled by Lew Grade, his brother. EMI's film division was renamed Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment, to reflect EMI's merger with Thorn Electrical Industries to become Thorn EMI in 1979. In March 1980, EMI were only making one film in Britain The Mirror Crack'd, which was released at the end of the year, but was a box-office failure. Lord Delfont announced that the company had purchased two British scripts, The Defense by John Mortimer and Off the Record by Frederick Forsyth. He admitted that sixty percent of the company's film budget would be spent in America the following year but \\"100% of the profits would come to this country... We have got to make films we believe are international, to get the money to bring exports back to this country.\\" In February 1981, Barry Spikings announced a slate of films worth ¬£70 million, including Honky Tonk Freeway, Memoirs of a Survivor, Comrades and The Knight (a Walter Hill film). The latter was not made. In March 1981, Spikings admitted AFD has not \\"gotten off to a flying start\\" and would be wound up, with Universal taking over distribution of EMI Films. He argued that \\"production and distribution are not linked\\" and pointed to the five Oscars that EMI films had earned. In particular, Can't Stop the Music (1980), Honky Tonk Freeway, and Raise the Titanic (1980) had been box-office failures. =Verity Lambert= In January 1983, Barry Spikings left the company and Verity Lambert was appointed head of production. Gary Dartnall became executive chairman. Lambert's first slate was Slayground, Comfort and Joy, Illegal Aliens (which became Morons from Outer Space) and Dreamchild. Lambert said they aimed to make five films a year ranging in budget from $5 to $10 million. In December 1984, Thorn EMI offered investors the chance to invest in several films by issuing ¬£36 million worth of shares. The films were A Passage to India (1984), Morons from Outer Space, Dreamchild, Wild Geese II and The Holcroft CovenantWalker 1985 p286 (all 1985). In March 1985, Thorn-EMI announced they would set up a production fund worth $175 million to make twenty films. Financier John Reiss said the fund would be used as loans for filmmakers or to invest in films budgeted around $13‚Äì14 million. Reiss said that the films would be made for international audiences, their typical audience member being a 42-year-old factory worker from Cincinnati. Lambert resigned in July 1985. After this TESE wound down its in-house production arm and relied on films from independent outfits.Walker, 1985, p35-36 The last films made under her watch were Clockwise and Link. Lambert later recalled the after she was hired, \\"the person who hired me left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films I was proud of... Dreamchild, and Clockwise... it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience. But I was determined to see out my three-year contract. By the end I'd had enough of corporate life and wanted to see what I could do as an independent.\\" =Denouement= Thorn EMI later sold its film production and distribution arm (Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment), home video (Thorn EMI Video), and cinema (ABC Cinemas) operations to businessman Alan Bond in April 1986. Bond, in turn, sold it to The Cannon Group a week later. A year after the purchase, a cash-strapped Cannon sold the film library to Weintraub Entertainment Group. The library ended up in the hands of several companies over the years and is now owned by StudioCanal, a sister company to Universal Music Group who acquired EMI in 2012 and parent company Canal+ Group's acquisition of European cinema operator UGC who acquired the library's then-owner, the United Kingdom-based Lumiere Pictures and Television in 1996, via Cannon Films. EMI Films also owned Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England; in turn, Cannon ended up purchasing the studio as well, but later sold it to Brent Walker Group in 1988, who in turn ended up selling half of the EMI Elstree Studios site to Tesco for a supermarket, before Hertsmere Council eventually acquired what was left of the Elstree Studios, and, as of 2018, still operates it as a film and television studios centre.

","title":"EMI Films"},{"id":"2165386","title":"Cameron Thor"},{"id":"2165388","text":"In formal semantics, truth-value semantics is an alternative to Tarskian semantics. It has been primarily championed by Ruth Barcan Marcus, H. Leblanc, and M. Dunn and N. Belnap. It is also called the substitution interpretation (of the quantifiers) or substitutional quantification. The idea of these semantics is that universal (existential) quantifier may be read as a conjunction (disjunction) of formulas in which constants replace the variables in the scope of the quantifier. E.g. ‚àÄxPx may be read (Pa & Pb & Pc &...) where a,b,c are individual constants replacing all occurrences of x in Px. The main difference between truth-value semantics and the standard semantics for predicate logic is that there are no domains for truth-value semantics. Only the truth clauses for atomic and for quantificational formulas differ from those of the standard semantics. Whereas in standard semantics atomic formulas like Pb or Rca are true if and only if (the referent of) b is a member of the extension of the predicate P, respectively, if and only if the pair (c,a) is a member of the extension of R, in truth-value semantics the truth-values of atomic formulas are basic. A universal (existential) formula is true if and only if all (some) substitution instances of it are true. Compare this with the standard semantics, which says that a universal (existential) formula is true if and only if for all (some) members of the domain, the formula holds for all (some) of them; e.g. ‚àÄxA is true (under an interpretation) if and only if for all k in the domain D, A(k/x) is true (where A(k/x) is the result of substituting k for all occurrences of x in A). (Here we are assuming that constants are names for themselves‚Äîi.e. they are also members of the domain.) Truth-value semantics is not without its problems. First, the strong completeness theorem and compactness fail. To see this consider the set {F(1), F(2),...}. Clearly the formula ‚àÄxF(x) is a logical consequence of the set, but it is not a consequence of any finite subset of it (and hence it is not deducible from it). It follows immediately that both compactness and the strong completeness theorem fail for truth-value semantics. This is rectified by a modified definition of logical consequence as given in Dunn and Belnap 1968. Another problem occurs in free logic. Consider a language with one individual constant c that is nondesignating and a predicate F standing for 'does not exist'. Then ‚àÉxFx is false even though a substitution instance (in fact every such instance under this interpretation) of it is true. To solve this problem we simply add the proviso that an existentially quantified statement is true under an interpretation for at least one substitution instance in which the constant designates something that exists.

Gameplay Gameplay is similar to Electronic Arts's own Need for Speed series. Beetle Adventure Racing supports up to four players. Two player races can be held in any of the tracks, provided they have been unlocked in the single player championship. Two to four players can also take part in the \\"Beetle Battle\\" mode, a vehicular combat mode in which players compete to collect six differently colored ladybugs (HSV pendants in HSV Adventure Racing), attempt to destroy the other competitors, and race for the exit once all the ladybugs are collected. Single player has two modes, Single Race and Championship. Single Race is single player racing against computer-controlled vehicles on any stage that has been unlocked in the Championship mode. Championship is considered the main game, where players are given three circuits starting with Novice, Advanced, and Professional, with a fourth secret circuit, the Bonus Circuit, which is unlocked after completing all previous circuits. Upon completing each circuit, new vehicles and tracks will be unlocked. Two special vehicles are unlocked by completing both Professional and Bonus circuits, the Alien Beetle and the Police Beetle respectively. The Alien Beetle's horn consists of the words, \\"We come in peace,\\" spoken in an alien voice. The Police Beetle uses a siren, in which all other computer racers stop and pull over upon hearing it. Four different types of crates are scattered along each track in Championship mode. Three of them are Point Crates, which are mostly found off track in shortcuts. The points are used to earn Continues during each race, with between 50 and 70 required to get the Continue (dependent on difficulty). Finding all point crates, which add up to 100 in total, gives players a new Arena In Beetle Battle Mode. Upon smashing through Nitro crates, the player is given a temporary boost of speed. These crates are usually found on hidden paths and beside the main roads. The fourth crate is a Cheat Crate, hidden on each stage. Smashing one, the player would hear, \\"Groovy!\\". Smashing a Cheat crate the first time unlocks the Cheat Menu, which offers cheat codes in both Two-Player Racing and Beetle Battle. The Cheat menu has an Easter egg in which all the developers of the game have their faces scattered on the background of the menu. Music The soundtrack is groovy breakbeat, featuring drums, organs, and guitars. The music was composed by Phil Western, Scott Blackwood, and Brenden Tennant. Reception Beetle Adventure Racing received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Square EA on November 26, 1999, Famitsu gave it a score of 28 out of 40. Next Generation rated it four stars out of five and stated that \\"Beetle Adventure Racing not only emerges as one of the best, but its level design will also serve as a watermark that other franchises like Top Gear and even EA's own Need for Speed will have to live up to.\\" Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground wrote, \\"Although the repetitiveness that comes from having only one style of vehicle to race with is a bit of a drag, I have to say that the modelling of the bugs has been well handled. [...] The scenery around the tracks is absolutely stunning. All of the environments in Beetle Adventure Racing feel like they're alive.\\" Lucas noted some graphical errors and felt that the game should have utilized the system's Expansion Pak for higher resolution, but wrote, \\"Still, all of the tracks are long, intense and littered with discovery. I couldn't bring myself to complain too loudly. The music and sound effects of Beetle Adventure Racing are so perfectly suited to the gameplay it's almost as if the audio was built first and the gameplay was designed around it.\\" Lucas concluded that, \\"Beetle Adventure Racing is the first truly addictive Nintendo 64 game of 1999.\\" Peer Schneider of IGN heavily praised the game's graphics, sound effects, detailed racing tracks, vehicle handling, and multiplayer mode, but wrote that \\"one of the game's strongest salespoints is also its Achilles' Heel. Make no mistake about it -- the Beetles are cool and deliver all the speed and handling you'd want, but what if EA had gone for a multi-car-license as with Need for Speed? We can only imagine how cool it would have been to compete for a Lotus or a Ferrari instead of another VW Bug. At the very least, EA could have included the classic Beetle model or a few other VW cars. The relatively limited number of tracks and cars is actually our only serious complaint.\\" Schneider also wrote, \\"Unfortunately, the music is limited to generic 'drum and bass' tracks. It's not that it's bad, it just doesn't fit most of the tracks and there is hardly any bass to be heard...\\" Schneider concluded, \\"Aside from Wave Race, this is definitely the best racer on N64 yet. [...] Beetle Adventure Racing arrives as a breath of fresh air in a genre that hasn't moved forward in years.\\" Shawn Sackenheim of AllGame praised the game's lengthy racetracks, its multiplayer mode, its \\"superb\\" use of various shortcuts, and wrote, \\"Visually, the game is exceptional with tons of personality in the car models, tracks, and overall presentation. [...] Soaking in all the graphic detail is something your eyes will thank you for--a breathtaking look at the Nintendo 64's true power! [...] There's just so much to cover in this game that it's hard to condense it to even a lengthy review without leaving so much out! [...] Some of the brightest and most vibrant graphics on the system! Nice bouncy tunes, but they repeat after only a few minutes. Great effects and minimal voice samples round out the package.\\" GameSpot claimed the game is a \\"great deal of fun\\". Proposed sequel A Beetle Adventure Racing II was in development, but has never been released.

It is an edited compilation of the first three episodes of the Davy Crockett television miniseries, Davy Crockett Indian Fighter, Davy Crockett Goes to Congress, and Davy Crockett at the Alamo, starring Fess Parker as Davy Crockett. Dave Smith. Disney A to Z. Disney Editions, 2006. 161. Plot =Creek Indian Wars= Two Tennessee wilderness settlers, Davy Crockett and his best friend George Russell (son of Captain William Russell and Agness H. Mccollough), volunteer to fight with General Andrew Jackson and Major Tobias Norton in the Creek War (1813-1814). They return home after a successful battle to make sure their families have enough provisions for the winter, rejoining a short time later to find the Americans at a stalemate against the Creeks, with Jackson having gone to New Orleans. Against Norton's orders, Crockett and Russell scout for Creek positions, and Russell is captured. Crockett tracks the Creeks to their camp, where he challenges the remaining Creek chief, Red Stick, to a tomahawk duel for Russell's life. Crockett wins, but agrees to spare Red Stick's life in exchange for his signing the American peace treaty. =Off to Congress= Crockett and Russell head west to scout virgin territory being opened for settlement, planning to send for Davy's family once a cabin has been built. They acquire a claim after beating Bigfoot Mason in a shooting contest. They learn that Mason is running Native Americans off their land in order to resell it, and befriend a family of Cherokee refugees Mason has victimized. Crockett offers to become the magistrate for the area. Crockett defeats Mason in hand- to-hand combat before arresting him and his surviving accomplice (the other one having been shot dead when he tried to shoot Crockett). Crockett is convinced to run for the state legislature against Amos Thorpe, a corrupt politician in league with men trying to claim Cherokee lands, who is running unopposed. He then receives a letter from his sister-in-law telling him that his wife has died of a fever. Crockett wins the election handily and becomes a popular member of the Tennessee General Assembly. He reunites with Norton and Andrew Jackson, who is running for President of the United States and convinces him to run for the United States House of Representatives. After he enters Congress, Norton, trying to pass a bill to usurp Native American treaty lands, has Crockett embark on a speaking tour across the eastern United States to distract him, but Russel learns of the bill and brings Crockett back to Washington to argue against it. Crockett tears the bill in half before leaving, ending his political career. =The Alamo= Crockett decides to join the Battle of the Alamo (1836), joined by George Russell. While traveling to San Antonio, they are joined by Thimblerig, a riverboat gambler, and Busted Luck, a Comanche tribesman. Reaching the Alamo, they join its defense, though Colonel James Bowie confides that their supplies are dangerously low. Russell manages to slip through the enemy lines to try to bring back help, only to return empty-handed. The Texan garrison withstands several attacks from Mexican troops before being overcome. George Russell, Thimblerig, Busted Luck, Travis, and a bedridden Colonel Bowie are all killed, leaving Crockett the sole defender standing. Crockett kills several Mexicans, though the surrounding Mexican army will inevitably kill him as well.

Life He was born in Mainz to Carl Joseph Gerhard (1793‚Äì1843) and Friederike (1789‚Äì1867) Cornelius, actors in Mainz and Wiesbaden. From an early age he played the violin and composed, eventually studying with Tekla Griebel-Wandall and composition with Heinrich Esser in 1841. He lived with his painter uncle Peter von Cornelius in Berlin from 1844 to 1852, and during this time he met prominent figures such as Alexander von Humboldt, the Brothers Grimm, Friedrich R√ºckert and Felix Mendelssohn. Cornelius's first mature works (including the opera Der Barbier von Bagdad) were composed during his brief stay in Weimar (1852-1858). His next place of residence was Vienna, where he lived for five years. It was in Vienna that Cornelius began a friendship with Richard Wagner. At the latter's behest, Cornelius moved to Munich in 1864, where he took a wife and fathered four children. In Britain to this day, Cornelius's best-known work is \\"The Three Kings\\", a song for voice and piano in which the soloist sings \\"Three Kings from Persian lands afar ...\\", while from the piano is heard the chorale tune of Philipp Nicolai, Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern (\\"How brightly shines the morning star\\") underneath. An arrangement by Ivor Atkins of \\"The Three Kings\\" for solo voice and choir is included in the first volume of the popular David Willcocks and Reginald Jacques compilation Carols for Choirs. During his last few years in Berlin, Cornelius wrote music criticism for several major Berlin journals and entered into friendships with Joseph von Eichendorff, Paul Heyse and Hans von B√ºlow. Despite his long-standing association with Wagner and Franz Liszt (the latter on occasion sought Cornelius's advice when it came to matters of orchestration), Cornelius's relations with the so-called \\"New German School\\" of composition were sometimes rocky. For instance, he did not attend the premiere of Tristan und Isolde, using the premiere of his own opera Der Cid as an excuse. Cornelius's third and final operatic project, Gunl√∂d, based on the Norse eddas, was left incomplete at his death (from diabetes) in Mainz. He was buried in the city's Hauptfriedhof, and his grave can still be seen there.

The company became known in the nautical world for manufacturing highly accurate marine chronometers and complicated timepieces used by over fifty of the world's navies from the end of the 19th century till 1950. According to the last official report of Neuch√¢tel Observatory in Switzerland, Ulysse Nardin had won numerous awards and honors for its marine chronometers from 1846 to 1975, including 4324 certificates, 2411 special prizes and 18 gold medals at International Exhibitions. The company was later taken over and re-invigorated in 1983 by Rolf W. Schnyder who transformed it into a profitable business again. Since 2014, it has been a subsidiary of the French Kering Group. Ulysse Nardin has operated out of the same building headquartered in Le Locle, Switzerland since 1865. The company today designs and manufactures luxury watches, dual time watches, marine chronometers, and sells its products through a network of distributors and several boutiques around the world. History = Early history = Ulysse Nardin was born in 1823 in Le Locle, Switzerland. During the long and snowy winters, inhabitants used to produce timekeeping instruments to survive, as they couldn't live from farming alone. Ulysse Nardin first trained as an apprentice horologist under his father, L√©onard-Fr√©d√©ric Nardin, and perfected his skills under the tutelage of Fr√©d√©ric-William Dubois and Louis JeanRichard-dit-Bressel, two master watchmakers who were experts in precision watches and whose fame extended beyond the mountains of Neuchatel, Switzerland. In 1846, at the age of 23, Ulysse Nardin founded his own company in Le Locle where its headquarters are still located. Despite Ulysse Nardin growing up in the Jura mountains, he was fascinated by the sea and produced nautical timekeeping instruments. His company became one of the first to manufacture marine chronometers and high-precision seafaring instruments for commercial ships and navies throughout the world. His pocket and marine chronometers became reference products in civil, military and scientific realms. Ulysse Nardin acquired a high-precision astronomical regulator, built by Jacques-Frederic Houriet in 1768, to rate his pocket chronometers. It is now in a museum in Le Locle. Minute repeaters, complicated watches and pocket chronometers carried the reputation of the company. Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin At that time, famous horologists were French and English. Ulysse Nardin went to London to challenge the best pocket chronometers makers. At the 1862 International Exhibition in London, Ulysse Nardin was awarded the Prize Medal in the category of \\"complicated watches and pocket chronometers\\" . The prize was the highest distinction for watchmaking in the United Kingdom. In 1867, Ulysse Nardin obtained the first series of certificates from Neuch√¢tel Observatory for its marine chronometers. In 1876, Ulysse Nardin died at age 53, and his son Paul-David Nardin succeeded him as the head of the company which continued to expand. In 1889, Ulysse Nardin won a Gold Medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition, was awarded two Swiss patents in 1890, won First Prize at the Chicago Universal Exhibition in 1893, and many more. In 1902, the company started to deliver marine chronometers to the US Navy. The brand regularly won Washington Naval Observatory competitions and became the official supplier for the US Navy's torpedo boats. The company has since provided timepieces to the navies of the United States, United Kingdom, Russia and Japan. Since the 1870s, over 50 navies and international shipping companies had been equipped with Ulysse Nardin marine chronometers. In 1975, the Neuch√¢tel Observatory published the last official edition on the performance of chronometers from 1846 to 1975. According to this report, Ulysse Nardin was awarded 4,324 performance certificates for mechanical marine chronometers out of 4,504 submitted (95%). = Recent development = Due to the quartz crisis, Ulysse Nardin faced significant challenges in late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1983, the company was acquired by businessman Rolf Schnyder who, in conjunction with watchmakers such as Ludwig Oechslin, revived the brand. Rolf Schnyder served as its chief executive and transformed the company into a healthy business. Schnyder and Oechslin would aim to produce complication timepieces using modern materials and manufacturing techniques. Ulysse Nardin has introduced several innovations. In 1996, Ulysse Nardin released its first marine chronometer wristwatch \\"Marine Chronometer 1846\\", and first perpetual calendar \\"Perpetual Ludwig\\". These timepieces were designed by Ludwig Oechslin for the 150th anniversary of the brand. After Schnyder' sudden death in 2011, Chai Schnyder, his wife, took over the company till it was acquired by the Kering group in 2014. In 2011, Ulysse Nardin acquired a Swiss enamaler workshop, Donz√© Cadrans, that has provided the brand the opportunity to use enamel in its watch dials. In 2012, Ulysse Nardin launched its first automatic caliber, entirely conceived and manufactured in-house: UN-118. One year later, Ulysse Nardin released five new in-house calibers (UN-690, UN-310, UN-170, UN-150 and UN-205). In 2014, Ulysse Nardin was acquired by the Kering luxury group, formerly known as PPR, which took a 100 % stake in the watch brand. In 2017, the company appointed Patrick Pruniaux, a previous executive of Apple, as its new CEO. In 2019, Ulysse Nardin has released three new calibers (UN-230, UN-371 and UN-631). The company still occupies its original headquarters in Le Locle, one of the main watch production hubs in northwest Switzerland and has also three manufacturing plants in: La Chaux-de-Fonds (R&D; and movement production site), Le Locle (Donz√© Cadrans site, which belongs to Ulysse Nardin but also produces enamel dials for other companies) and Sion (Sigatec site, which produces micromecanics components in silicium). While marine wrist chronometers are still a specialty for the brand, it produces luxury complicated timepieces with high sophistication for men and women. The company sells its products through a network of distributors and several boutiques around the globe, as well as through retailers in Europe, America, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Australia, China and Russia. Ulysse Nardin is part of the exclusive circle of Swiss watchmaking, the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie.  Watch manufacturing  The company has an integrated production system. The majority of the work is done in-house, from conception, design, development and crafting through to production. The brand produces its own high-precision components, movements and calibers. Since the acquisition of Donz√© Cadrans, Ulysse Nardin creates its own enamel dials. Pieces are heated to a high temperature (1500¬∞F or 850¬∞C) repeatedly, several times, as layers of color are added. This requires hours of work. Engineers, drafting technicians, technical and caliber designers develop new technologies, and design movements. They produce prototypes and tools for the workshops. Profile turners or specialist setters supervise the production of pieces required for the balance axis, screws, pins and the other minute parts. Decorators engrave plates and bridges with distinctive patterns. Experienced watchmakers then assemble the finished components, working on the movements of in-house calibers. Another team of watchmakers, specialized in highly complicated timepieces, works on the movement assemblies and casings of complex mechanisms (minute repeater, hourstriker, tourbillon...) and astronomical timepieces. Quality control experts perform checks on everything: aesthetics, watch functions, waterproofing, etc. Some watches have a chronometer movement certified for accuracy by the Contr√¥le Officiel Suisse des Chronom√®tres, the official Swiss testing agency. Ulysse Nardin has also its own quality certification, the Ulysse Nardin Certificate, with standards for quality higher than the COSC. Notable models A Freak wristwatch =Freak= Ulysse Nardin introduced the Freak wristwatches in 2001. The first timepiece of this collection was the \\"Laboratory on the wrist\\" Freak watch. The model contains a revolutionary 7-day carrousel-tourbillon, and has no (true) dial, crown or hands. The movement contains silicon escapement components, and would rotate on itself to indicate time. The watch model was named \\"Watch of the Year\\" in innovation category in 2002. This use of silicon parts in a mechanical movement was an industry first. In 2005, the brand launched the \\"Freak Diamond Heart\\" watch, featuring a patented escapement made from synthetic diamonds. In 2007, the company presented a new material, Diamonsil, which combines silicium and synthetic diamonds. It eliminates friction and removes the need for lubrication of the escapement. The brand also launched the \\"Freak Diamonsil\\" watch, using this nanotechnology for the escapement. The same year, the brand released \\"Innovision 1\\" watch, featuring 10 innovations. In 2017, the brand presented ten innovations, gathered within a new Freak watch, named \\"Innovision 2\\". One year later, the company launched the \\"Freak Vision\\" with three patents out of \\"Innovision 2\\" : \\"Grinder\\" winding system, constant power escapement and balance wheel in silicium with micro palets. The current Freak model includes two series: Freak Out and Freak Vision (introduced in 2017). = Trilogy of Time = The first major advancement of the company after quartz crisis was the launch of \\"Trilogy of Time\\". This collection incorporated three different astronomical pieces starting in 1985 with the release of the Astrolabium Galileo Galilei, named after Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. The Astrolabium displays local and solar time, the orbits and eclipses of the sun and the moon and the positions of several major stars. It was named by the Guinness Book of Records in 1989 as the world's most- functional watch (with 21 distinct functions). Dr. Oechslin then followed the Astrolabium up with two other astronomical watches: in 1988 the Planetarium Copernicus (named after the stargazing theaters called planetariums and of astronomer Copernicus) and in 1992 the Tellurium Johannes Kepler (named after the Latin 'Tellus' meaning Earth, a Tellurian and astronomer Johannes Kepler). The Cloisonn√© dial of the Tellurium takes fifty-four processes, twelve baking operations and more than fifty hours of work by a skilled craftsman to transform a draft sketch on a small metal disc into a unique work of art - each and every Tellurium is unique.

In 2015, for the sixth edition of the Only Watch Charity Auction, the brand released the ‚ÄùOnly Watch Stranger‚Äù watch, equipped with a music box. On the hour, the watch plays Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe are the Champions‚Äù thanks to the copyright granted to Ulysse Nardin for its participation to the charity cause association. First introduced in 2013, the Stranger was named after Frank Sinatra‚Äôs 1966 song ‚ÄúStrangers in the Night‚Äù that the timepiece reproduced through a musical box mechanism. Since 2017, Ulysse Nardin has been the official sponsor of Sweden's Artemis Racing team at the America's Cup race.

Early years Radowitz was born to Roman Catholic nobility in Blankenburg am Harz, in Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. His family being of Serb-Hungarian origin. He received a military education in France and fought in Napoleon's army. As a young lieutenant in the Westphalian artillery, Radowitz was wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of Leipzig (1813), subsequently entered the Hanoverian service, and in 1823 that of Prussia. His promotion was rapid, and in 1830 he became chief of the general staff of the artillery. Prussian envoy In 1836, Radowitz went as Prussian military plenipotentiary to the federal diet at Frankfurt, and in 1842 was appointed envoy to the courts of Karlsruhe, Darmstadt and Nassau. He had early become an intimate friend of the crown prince (afterwards King Frederick William IV), and the Prussian constitution of February 1847 was an attempt to realize the ideas put forward by him in his Gespr√§che aus den Gegenwart der Staat und Kirche, published under the pseudonym \\"Waldheim\\" in 1846. Promoting Prussian unionist policy In November 1847 and March 1848 Radowitz was sent by Frederick William to Vienna to attempt to arrange common action for the reconstruction of the German Confederation. In the Frankfurt Parliament he was leader of the conservative Right; and, after its break-up, he was zealous in promoting the Unionist policy of Prussia, which he defended both in the Prussian diet and in the Erfurt parliament. Prussian foreign minister He was practically responsible for the foreign policy of Prussia from May 1848 onwards, and on 27 September 1851 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs. He resigned, however, on 2 November, owing to the king's refusal to settle the difficulties with the Austrian Empire by an appeal to arms. Literary pursuits In August 1852, he was appointed director of military education, but the rest of his life was devoted mainly to literary pursuits. Radowitz published, in addition to several political treatises, Ikonographie der Heiligen, im Beitrag zur Kunstgeschichte (Berlin, 1834) and Devisen und Mottos des sp√§tern Mittelalters (ii., 1850). His Gesammelte Schriften were published in 5 vols. at Berlin, 1852-53. Death Radowitz died on 25 December 1853 in Berlin. Sources *Josef von Radowitz.

Appearance It is very similar to and very closely related to its sister species, the Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, differing in having a slightly more \\"scooped\\" forehead and reaching a larger length of . Most individuals only reach around . The greatest recorded weight for a specimen of this species is , there is very little evidence for this, most people assume it was a typo i.e. it was 10 lb and not 10 kg. Reproduction Estuary perch breed in winter at the same time as Australian bass, and are similarly sexually dimorphic, with females larger than males. Females reach sexual maturity at older ages and larger sizes than males. In Victoria, estuary perch/Australian bass hybrids are regularly recorded; most hybrids appear to be reproductively viable. Spawning occurs at the mouths of estuaries, rivers, and streams during winter and spring when water temperatures are 14-19 ¬∞C. In New South Wales, this occurs from July to August, while in the western regions of Victorian waters this happens from November to December.Native Fish Australia: Estuary Perch www.nativefish.asn.au Eggs are semibuoyant, nonadhesive, and in diameter. They hatch into larvae after 2‚Äì3 days. Age Estuary perch, as also many other native fish of southeast Australia, are very long-lived. Longevity is a survival strategy to ensure that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Ni√±a years and may only occur every one or two decades. Maximum recorded age is 41 years. Fishing The estuary perch is a popular recreational angling fish in the states of Victoria (particularly) and New South Wales. The fish was once caught commercially with seine nets during their winter spawning migrations. However, recently declining numbers mean the species is now protected from commercial fishing and bag limits occasionally apply on recreational angling.

Best known for his starring role in the 2006 comedy film Grandma's Boy, he is a frequent collaborator with actor and friend Adam Sandler with prominent roles in such films as Happy Gilmore (1996), The Wedding Singer (1998), Big Daddy (1999), Little Nicky (2000), Mr. Deeds (2002), Anger Management (2003), 50 First Dates (2004), Strange Wilderness (2008), and Just Go with It (2011). Early and personal life Covert was born in West Palm Beach, Florida, the son of Elizabeth Ann (n√©e Duhy) and Stephen Covert.Google News He studied theater at New York University, where he was a classmate of Adam Sandler. Covert has served as a performer, writer, and/or producer for almost every film and comedy album Sandler has ever released. Covert currently resides in California. Covert's father was Jewish and his mother was a Southern Baptist. Covert co-founded a young children's publishing company geared towards basic American history. On July 18, 2019, he got a divorce from his wife. Career Covert's first film role was a cruise ship bartender in Sandler's 1989 film Going Overboard which also was Sandler's first cinematic appearance, who played Shecky, who aspired to be the cruise ships house comedian. Covert had minor parts in several subsequent Sandler films before his first prominent role in 1998's The Wedding Singer alongside Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Covert would continue to have fairly large roles in Sandler's next four films, including one in Little Nicky for which he gained 40 pounds. He eventually settled back into smaller walk-on and single- scene appearances in Sandler's films beginning with 50 First Dates in 2004. However, in 2006 Covert starred in the comedy film Grandma's Boy, his first (and only) lead role. Sandler didn't act in that film but served as an executive producer. Covert has also had small roles in four films that neither star or are produced by Sandler: Never Been Kissed, Late Last Night, Heavyweights, and The Cable Guy. Although Covert's on-screen presence has been reduced in recent years, he has continued to serve an active role in Adam Sandler's movie production company, Happy Madison Productions, where Covert is an executive producer and sometimes co-writer on most of the company's films. In addition, Covert has contributed heavily to Sandler's many comedy albums, and frequently receives co-songwriting credits on the original songs that Sandler performs in many of his films. Covert also appeared as himself, along with Adam Sandler, in an episode of the television series Undeclared. The show's creator, Judd Apatow, is another friend and former college classmate of Covert and Sandler. Covert is also a cofounder of Cherry Tree Books, a publisher of eBooks for children.

The Buchholz relay is used as a protective device sensitive to the effects of dielectric failure inside the equipment. A generic designation for this type of device is \\"gas detector relay\\". Application Two ball- shaped floats and two glass-enclosed reed switches are visible inside this cutaway view of a Buchholz relay Buchholz relays have been applied on oil- filled power and distribution transformers at least since the 1940s. The relay is connected to the oil piping between the overhead conservator tank and the main oil tank of a transformer. The piping between the main tank and conservator is arranged so that any gas evolved in the main tank tends to flow upward toward the conservator and gas detector relay. Tutorial T5 Schematic diagram of a large oil-filled power transformer. The conservator tank, green, at right, is marked 3 and the Buchholz relay is marked 5 Operation Depending on the model, the relay has multiple methods to detect a failing transformer. On a slow accumulation of gas, due perhaps to slight overload, gas produced by decomposition of insulating oil accumulates in the top of the relay and forces the oil level down. A float switch in the relay is used to initiate an alarm signal. Depending on design, a second float may also serve to detect slow oil leaks. If an electrical arc forms, gas accumulation is rapid, and oil flows rapidly into the conservator. This flow of oil operates a switch attached to a vane located in the path of the moving oil. This switch normally will operate a circuit breaker to isolate the apparatus before the fault causes additional damage. Buchholz relays have a test port to allow the accumulated gas to be withdrawn for testing. Flammable gas found in the relay indicates some internal fault such as overheating or arcing, whereas air found in the relay may only indicate low oil level or a leak. C. Christopoulos, A. Wright, Electrical Power System Protection Second Edition, Springer Science & Business Media, 1999, page 215 Through a connected gas sampling device the control can also be made from the ground. Depending on the requirements, the Buchholz relay has a flange or threaded connection. The classic Buchholz relay has to comply with the requirements of the DIN EN 50216-2 standard. Depending on the requirements, it is equipped with up to four (2 per float) switches or change-over switches, which can either send a light signal or switch off the transformer.Operating principle of buchholz relay The relay was first developed by Max Buchholz (1875‚Äì1956) in 1921.

The name may refer to the size and often the cleanliness of the venue, or a lack of dressing rooms leading to the band being required to change in the toilets. Most of Britain's large towns and cities are home to at least one toilet circuit venue, although a regular toilet-circuit tour is only around 20 dates long at the most, meaning not all of the said venues are present in all toilet-circuit tours. Some of the largest cities, however, such as London, Manchester, Glasgow and Nottingham, appear on almost every tour, and these cities accordingly have many venues which could be described as \\"toilet venues\\". The circuit is mentioned in the Muse song \\"Muscle Museum\\" ‚Äì \\"I have played in every toilet.\\" Frank Turner also references it in the song \\"I Still Believe\\", as \\"toilet circuit touring stops\\". The 21st century saw the closure of several well-known toilet circuit venues, with many more under threat. In London, for example, 40% of the city's live music venues were said to have closed in the decade to 2016. This trend increased after the passing of the Live Music Act 2012, which allowed any venue with under 200 capacity to hold live music without a licence, and has been cited as a major factor in the decline of paid-entry live music events.

According to legend, the Leonberger was ostensibly bred as a \\"symbolic dog\\" that would mimic the lion in the town coat of arms. It is in the Working Group for dog shows such as Crufts, but not at the World Dog Show.  Description  Leonberger male =Appearance= This breed occurs with a generous double coat; the Leonberger is a large, muscular, and elegant dog with balanced body type, medium temperament, and dramatic presence. The head is adorned with a striking black mask and projects the breed's distinct expression of intelligence, pride, and kindliness. Remaining true to their early roots as a capable family and working dog and search and rescue dog (particularly water), the surprisingly agile Leonberger is sound and coordinated, with both strength in bearing and elegance in movement. A sexually dimorphic breed, the Leonberger possesses either a strongly masculine or elegantly feminine form, making gender immediately discernible.Junehall, Petra Breed Standard: Leonberger, 08-tryck, 2005. =Size, proportion, and substance= Height at withers: * Male: : average * Female: : average Weight: Leonberger female * Males: : average * Females: : average Capable of demanding work, the Leonberger is a dog of ample substance. Its frame is supported with well-muscled, medium to heavy bone in direct proportion to its size. A roomy chest is sufficiently broad and deep for the purpose of work. Seen in profile, the chest curves inward from the prosternum, tangenitally joins at the elbow to its underline at 50% of the withers' height and then continues slightly upward toward the stifle. =Head= The head is well balanced in proportion to the size of the dog and is deeper than broad with the length of muzzle and the length of skull approximately equal. With close fitting eyelids, the eyes are set into the skull upon a slight oblique; the eyes are medium-sized, almond shaped, and colored dark brown. The ears are fleshy, moderately sized, and pendant shaped, with sufficient substance to hang close to the skull and drop the tip of the ears level with the inside corners of the mouth. The Leonberger's ears rise from halfway between the eye and the top of his skull to level with the top of his skull. Though level bites and slight anomalies not affecting the robustness of the lower jaw are common, the ideal Leonberger capably possesses a strong scissor bite with full dentition. =Coat= thumb Both a necessity for work and a defining attribute of the breed, the Leonberger has a water-resistant double coat on his body that is complemented by the shorter, fine hair on his muzzle and limbs. The long, profuse, outer coat is durable, relatively straight, lies flat, and fits close. A mature, masculine Leonberger exhibits a pronounced mane. Similarly, his tail is very well furnished from the tip to the base where it blends harmoniously with the breech's furnishings. Climate permitting, his undercoat is soft and dense. Apart from a neatening of the feet, the Leonberger is presented untrimmed. = Color = A variety of coat colors are acceptable, including all combinations of lion-yellow, red, red-brown, and sand. Nose leather, foot pads and lips should always be black. Faulty colors include brown with brown nose leather, black and tan, black, white or silver and eyes without any brown. A small patch of white on the chest or toes is permitted. =Temperament= upright First and foremost a family dog, the Leonberger's temperament is one of its most important and distinguishing characteristics. Well socialized and trained, the Leonberger is self-assured, insensitive to noise, submissive to family members, friendly toward children, well composed with passersby, and self-disciplined when obliging its family or property with protection. Robust, loyal, intelligent, playful, and kindly, they can thus be taken anywhere without difficulty and adjust easily to a variety of circumstances, including the introduction of other dogs. Proper control and early socialization and training are essential, as this is a giant breed. Health Leonbergers are strong, generally healthy dogs. Hip dysplasia, which devastates many large breeds, is largely controlled because of the effort of many breeders who actively screen their Leonbergers using X-rays evaluated by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and leave dysplastic specimens out of the gene pool, thereby reducing the risk of bone/joint problems. For over 20 years, breeders belonging to the Leonberger Club of America, which issued pedigrees for the Leonberger breed in America, adhered to many aspects of the German breeding program, whereby member kennels may only choose to breed dogs that were certified as three generation free of hip dysplasia. As a likely result, the incidence of hip dysplasia in the breed was reduced to almost 10% and the occurrence of OFA-rated \\"Excellent\\" hips increased by over 60% in just 20 years. Current incidence rates of hip dysplasia in Leonbergers are likely around 13%. After 2010, when the Leonberger Club of America joined the American Kennel Club, the formerly strict breeding rules are no longer mandatory for all Leonbergers. Though not common, Leonbergers do inherit and/or develop a number of diseases that range in their impact from mild to devastating. In addition to hip dysplasia, Leonbergers can inherit and/or develop heart problems, inherited Leonberger paralysis/polyneuropathy, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteochondrosis dissecans, allergies, digestive disorders, cataracts, entropion/ectropion eyelids, progressive retinal atrophy, perianal fistulas, and thyroid disorders. Though rumors persist of Leonbergers being more sensitive to anesthesia than other breeds of dog, they are largely untrue. Leonbergers, like other large breed dogs, require less dosage per pound of sedative than smaller breeds to yield the same effect. The Leonberger Health Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation whose sole mission is to support major researchers who are seeking to identify genetic markers for serious diseases which affect the breed, is currently focusing on osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and Leonberger polyneuropathy. =Longevity= Leonbergers in U.K. and U.S./Canada surveys had a median lifespan around 7 years, which is about 4 years less than the average purebred dog, but typical of similarly sized breeds. About 20% of Leonbergers in the surveys lived to 10 years or more. The oldest dogs in both surveys died at about 13. In France, the breed has a median lifespan of 8.75 years. mean=8.18 ¬± 3.1 median=8.75 Serious diseases can affect the Leonberger‚Äîcertain types of cancers are very common in the breed. Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called bloat, is another serious condition that affects many of the large- and giant-breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests. It causes the stomach to twist and can be fatal quite quickly.Health at LeonbergerClubofAmerica.com Adult Leonbergers should always be fed twice a day rather than one large meal to reduce the likelihood of bloat. Leonbergers are not alone in inheriting serious diseases, and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds. In a 2004 U.K. Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (45%), cardiac disease (11%), and \\"unknown\\" (8.5%). In a 2000 U.S./Canada Leonberger Club of America survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (37%), old age (12%), cardiac disease (9%), and \\"sudden death\\" (8%).Summary of the 2000 Health Mortality and Morbidity Survey Findings. Leonberger Club of America. LEO Watch Volume 2, Spring 2002. Archived from the original Studies have indicated problems with inherited polyneuropathy in certain populations of Leonbergers and cataracts in dogs in the United Kingdom. A study of \\"Leonberger polyneuropathy\\" was published in 2014. Genetic testing is to be done through a protocol administered in North America by the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. or Institute of Genetics, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland History In the 1830s, Heinrich Essig, a dog breeder and seller and mayor of the town of Leonberg near Stuttgart in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, claimed to have created the Leonberger by crossing a female Landseer Newfoundland with a \\"barry\\" male from the Great St Bernard Hospice and Monastery (which would later create the Saint Bernard). Later, according to Essig, a Pyrenean Mountain Dog was added, resulting in very large dogs with the long, white coats that were the fashion for the time, and a pleasant temperament. The first dogs registered as Leonbergers were born in 1846 and had many of the prized qualities of the breeds from which they were derived. The popular legend is that it was bred to resemble the coat-of-arms animal of Leonberg, the lion. The Leonberger dog became popular with several European royal households, including Napoleon II, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, the Prince of Wales, Otto Von Bismarck, Emperor Napoleon III, and Umberto I of Italy. Essig's claim of breeding the dog as described is disputed. Records from as early as 1585 may indicate the existence of Leonberger-type dogs; documents dating from 1601 held by the Metternich family describe similar dogs used to deter the theft of livestock. Either way, no doubt exists that Essig named and registered the breed first. A black-and-white engraving of the Leonberger was included in The Illustrated Book of the Dog by Vero Shaw (at p. 488) in 1881. At the time, Essig's Leonbergers were denounced as an indifferent knockoff of a St. Bernard‚Äînot a stable and recognized breed‚Äîand a product of a popular fad or fashion for large and strong dogs, fomented in part by Essig's prodigious marketing skills (he gave dogs to the rich and famous). at Internet Archive The modern look of the Leonberger, with darker coats and black masks, was developed during the latter part of the 20th century by reintroducing other breeds, such as the Newfoundland. This was necessary because breeding stocks of the Leonberger were seriously affected by the two world wars. During World War I, most Leonbergers were left to fend for themselves as breeders fled or were killed. Reportedly, only five Leonbergers survived World War I and were bred until World War II when, again, almost all Leonbergers were lost. During the two world wars, Leonbergers were used to pull the ammunition carts, a service to the breed's country that resulted in the Leonbergers' near-destruction. Karl Stadelmann and Otto Josenhans are credited as the breed's saviors, bringing them back from almost extinction. Leonbergers today can have their ancestry traced to the eight dogs that survived World War II. Traditionally, Leonbergers were kept as farm dogs and were much praised for their abilities in watchdog and draft work. They were frequently seen pulling carts around the villages of Bavaria and surrounding districts. Around the beginning of the 20th century, Leonbergers were imported by the government of Canada for use as water rescue/lifesaving dogs. The breed continues in that role today, along with the Newfoundland, Labrador Retriever, and Golden Retriever; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard. They have been used successfully as flock guard dogs. The Leonberger received American Kennel Club recognition as a member of the Working Group on January 1, 2010, alongside the Icelandic Sheepdog and the Cane Corso. It was the 167th breed to be recognized by the AKC. In popular culture Three Leonberger dogs (one was a female, two were males) played the main character Buck in The Call of the Wild: Dog of the Yukon (1997), a Canadian rendition of Jack London's The Call of the Wild which stars Rutger Hauer as John Thornton and is narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. The breed used in this movie was not the one identified as Buck in the novel. In The Equalizer, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) visits his former CIA co- workers at their large Virginia home, which has two Leonbergers. The breed has been featured on stamps from many countries. The Lifetime TV movie Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever features a Leonberger that becomes a victim of a kidnapping, co-starring with the famous Grumpy Cat. In The Secret of Moonacre, Wrolf is played by a Leonberger. In Rammstein's \\"Deutschland\\" music video, a Leonberger is featured as a birth product of the Germania character. In the story Murphy and the Great Surf Rescue in Gill Lewis' Puppy Academy series of children's books, Murphy is a Leonberger puppy whose special skill is swimming.

It was Abbey's third published novel and followed Jonathan Troy and The Brave Cowboy. Plot summary Abbey includes the following paragraph to introduce this book: The hero of the story is John Vogelin, a New Mexico rancher whose land is about to be condemned by the United States Air Force, who want to use his land to expand a bombing range. He is the last holdout among the several people whose land the Air Force wants, and he refuses to move. The story of his resistance to being thrown off his land and his death is told through the eyes of his grandson, who is visiting the ranch for the summer. Criticism of Government The book is essentially a critique on the over-extension of government. Abbey makes an argument for limited government, more explicitly to limit government's ability to expropriate private land. However, Abbey still opposed the private sector from developing on natural lands, arguments which were explored in later books such as The Monkey Wrench Gang through the novel's antagonist, which put him at odds with aspects of these ideologies. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 1981 the book was made into a made- for-television movie, Fire on the Mountain. Buddy Ebsen played John Vogelin and Ron Howard played Lee Mackie.

Cahalan's biography of Abbey. Only 5,000 copies were printed and almost immediately after it was released the author wanted to disown the work. He asked that it never be published again, and it has not been, making it very rare and the only one of his eight novels that many Edward Abbey fans have not read. When a fan once asked where they could find a copy of the novel, Abbey is reported to have told them \\"I don't know where you can find one, but if you do, burn it.\\" Copies of the book offered for sale online start at $1,300 and go up to $7,500. Abbey's disgust with the novel was immediate. According to James M. Cahalan's biography, Edward Abbey, A Life, he could barely get through the galleys before the book was published. He said it seemed \\"even worse than I had thought,\\" too \\"juvenile, naive, succeeded in almost nothing. Too much empty rhetoric, not enough meat and bone. Not convincing. All the obvious faults of the beginner.\\" In 1984 Abbey was quoted by William Plummer in \\"Edward Abbey's Desert Solecisms\\" as saying that Jonathan Troy \\"was a disgusting novel, fortunately long out of print. ... It's about the agonies of growing up in a small town: pimples and masturbation. There's a Faulkner chapter, an entire chapter in one sentence ... There's a Thomas Wolfe wind- through-the-trees-outside-the-farmhouse chapter, a Joyce chapter, and of course there are newspaper clips all through the thing, like in Dos Passos's Nineteen Nineteen.\\" This is the only one of Abbey's eight novels that was set entirely east of the Mississippi River and away from his beloved deserts of the Southwestern United States. He does spend a good portion of The Fool's Progress in West Virginia, but it starts in Tucson and then follows a road trip to its climax. Background In high school Abbey kept a journal and often used the moniker Jonathan Troy to refer to himself. While no one has claimed that the book is in any way an autobiographical account, it was not well received by people who had known Abbey during his senior year of high school. The contempt Jonathan shows for the residents of his home town was a hard blow to people Abbey knew in high school, a fact that may have had something to do with Abbey's later regret at having published this book. Still, as with his later novels, the book contains more fiction than fact. For example, in the book, Jonathan lives alone with his one-eyed father. In real life, both of Abbey's parents were living and his father had two perfectly good eyes. According to the back of the book jacket, Abbey began writing Jonathan Troy as a creative writing assignment at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque under the sponsorship of Professor C.V. Wicker. After receiving his B.A. degree in 1951, Abbey spent a year at the University of Edinburgh. It was there that the greater part of Jonathan Troy was completed. Plot summary Many of the other characters in the book refer to Jonathan Troy as the golden boy. He's a senior at the local high school and they call him that because he has everything: Looks, intelligence and talent. But he is not an easy character for the reader to like. We're given an insight into the mind of a teen-age boy, where he holds nearly everyone he meets in contempt‚Äîespecially his father, Nathaniel, and his favorite teacher, Feathersmith. The book is written as a series of different events, almost none of them related. Jonathan has had an ongoing relationship with one girl, Etheline. But once he finally succeeds in seducing her, he begins to lose interest, especially when she starts talking about marriage. A chance meeting with a new girl in town, Leafy, gives him new inspiration and he begins pursuit of her. Abbey also introduces the only major gay character in any of his eight novels, Phillip Feathersmith. Abbey doesn't come right out and say he's gay, but he describes his \\"fairy-flower\\" hands, talks about what a pink little fellow he is, and Jonathan calls him \\"Fairysmith\\" in his own mind. Feathersmith shows an attraction to Jonathan that is not very subtle. Most of the story is set in a western Pennsylvania town called Powhattan. It was actually based on the town near where Abbey grew up, Indiana, Pennsylvania. Abbey even uses some of the names of businesses in Indiana in the 1940s for his story. The Blue Star Restaurant becomes the Blue Bell Bar that is the business under the apartment Jonathan Troy shares with his father. There are many hints of the greatness Abbey would fine tune in his later works, including his love of the desert (Jonathan longs to go there); his deep passion for women and beer; and above all his sense of humor. One of the memorable characters in the book is Fatgut, a pathological liar who Jonathan seems close to. But for most of the book you figure Jonathan has no friends, mostly because he's too full of himself. You hear his every thought, and it's all very brutally honest. The key secondary character of the story is Jonathan's father, Nathaniel Troy. He is a Communist living in 1950s America, right about the time of the Red Scare. He receives almost daily threats to his well-being. Jonathan avoids his father as much as possible, living a mostly independent life. But the climax of the story comes when some town drunks decide they're going to make the Communist kiss the American flag. Another character in the novel is Red Ginter, who would also be a character in The Fool's Progress. In this book, Ginter is the neighborhood bully who has tormented Jonathan most of his life. In the latter book, he's a member of a baseball team who hits the game-winning home run, but then refuses to run the bases. There was a real person named Earl \\"Red\\" Ginter who was part of Abbey's early life and seems to be the inspiration for these characters. There is no nobility in Jonathan Troy. Having access to his thoughts kills any affection you might be able to muster. He's rude to nearly everyone he meets, especially his father. Once he's made love to Etheline, he looks at her again with fresh perspective and decides he hates her body. And when given an opportunity to stand up for something noble, Jonathan usually turns and heads in the other direction. One of the techniques Abbey uses in this book is devote a few chapters to printing notices in the local newspaper. It provides a slice of small-town life and in at least one case, relates to the plot.

He rejects much of modern technology, prefers to cut down any fence he comes across, will not carry any kind of modern identification such as a driver's license or Social Security card, and refuses to register for the draft. When his friend Paul Bondi, who is a philosophical anarchist, is jailed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for refusing to register for the draft, Burns deliberately gets himself arrested in an attempt to break his friend out of jail, but winds up on the run from the law himself. Bondi has been tried and is awaiting transport from county jail to federal prison but refuses to escape with Burns. As police have discovered that Burns has also never registered for the draft, authorities are intent on sending Burns to trial and eventually federal prison for violation of the Selective Service Act of 1948. Burns eventually escapes reluctantly leaving his friend behind. After a brief stop to say goodbye to Paul's wife, Jerry, and son, Seth, Jack heads into the Sandia Mountains, just east of Albuquerque, on horseback. The police mount a manhunt and pull out all the stops to capture Burns, including helicopters on loan by the Air Force. If Burns can scale the mountain range, he figures he can escape under the cover of the forest on the other side. The police know this as well, so they position themselves to prevent that from happening. Links to other work Many casual fans of Abbey might consider George Washington Hayduke as the author's favorite character, but it was John W. \\"Jack\\" Burns who Abbey kept writing about. Burns is introduced in The Brave Cowboy. He is also a major character in Abbey's science fiction novel, Good News. Burns makes cameo appearances in both The Monkey Wrench Gang and Hayduke Lives!. The Brave Cowboy also contains elements of future books, though the relationship between them is unclear. The Brave Cowboy explains that Burns is the grandson of Henry Vogelin, whose ranch Burns spent time on as a child. The ranch, currently in the hands of the US Air Force is part of a base commanded by General DeSalius. Vogelin and DeSalius will be characters six years later in Abbey's 1962 work Fire on the Mountain, the story of a boy from the East Coast who visits his grandfather's ranch and falls in love with the desert and ranch life just in time to see both destroyed by development. However, Burns's time on the ranch is well detailed in Brave Cowboy and the only characters the stories share are Vogelin and DeSalius. Though the book is written as a memoir, Jack seems too old to have been the boy staying on the ranch at the moment of dispossession. Having written Fire On The Mountain after The Brave Cowboy, Abbey chose to write about the child \\"Billy\\" rejecting the option of using the novel to explain the past of Jack Burns. Yet it is still possible that the novels are directly linked, as the number of Vogelin's children is never revealed. Jack and Billy may be cousins or brothers, and the Vogelin and ranch in question may indeed be the same in both novels.  Publication  The first edition of the book is considered the rarest of Abbey's eight novels. There was only one printing of 5,000 copies and many of them have not survived. One online rare book dealer shows copies of the first U.S. edition start at $4,000 and the highest asking price is $10,000. Film version Kirk Douglas gave the film version of The Brave Cowboy the title Lonely Are the Brave, his personal favorite. It was adapted by Academy Award-winning‚Äîand formerly blacklisted‚Äîscreenwriter Dalton Trumbo. Released in 1962, it is one of only two films made based on Abbey's novels. British writer/director/actor Alex Cox has lauded the film, writing that \\"there is no greater western, and certainly no more tragic one.\\" The second Abbey adaptation was Fire on the Mountain, which was a made-for-TV movie that starred Ron Howard and Buddy Ebsen. A third film, based on Abbey's most popular novel, The Monkey Wrench Gang, is currently in development.\\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" at IMDb. Catherine Hardwicke is scheduled to direct the film.

The organisation was officially registered on Friday 27 July 1990 (5 Muharram 1411 of the Islamic calendar) when its registration was accepted by The Registrar of Society, Malaysia. Its women wing, Wanita JIM, was established in 1993. Today, JIM has 14 state and 54 district branches, with its headquarters in Melawati City Centre, Kuala Lumpur. It has more than 8,000 members all over Malaysia. JIM's motto is \\"Bersama Islam Membina Masyarakat\\", which literally means \\"(Together) With Islam (We Are) Building Society\\". History =The Pioneers= Hj. Saari Sungib (who was also known as \\"Abu 'Urwah\\" was the Chairman for the Sponsorship Committee of JIM's establishment. He then became the first president of JIM. Abu 'Urwah held the post of presidency for 10 years starting from 1990 until 1999. Among the early leadership of JIM were, Ustaz Alias Osman, Shari Bahri, Zaid Kamaruddin, Dr. Mohamed Hatta Shaharom, Dr. Sahrim Ahmad, Kamaliah Nordin and Aliza Jaafar. Fuziah Salleh was the first Head of JIM's Women wing from 1993 to 1999. Fuziah together with a few other Women activists of JIM had founded this institution. During the early years of JIM, the Women's wing were led by Rawiyah Zakaria, Norainee Kamaruddin, Salwani Mohd Daud and Wan Zarina Wan Zakaria.  JIM's Da'wah Operations  =Phase 1 (1991-1995)= At this stage, To JIM, in uplifting Islam in Malaysia, it has to begin from what is available to the Muslims in the country. Their ethos is controversial, outdated and claims that \\"One valuable asset is the Malay supremacy (ketuanan Melayu)\\". Rational people will deem that in today's day and age there is no such thing as 'one race' claiming supremacy over another. As such, the transformation process, from the current situation to an Islamic one, is believed to have happened in a harmonious way, without disturbing the stability of the status quo (Saari Sungib 1995). Such a process is termed by JIM as homeostasis, a process that originated from the French scientist Claude Bernard to mean, in the social reformation domain, a transformation process that does not change the fundamental strength in the system (Saari Sungib 1997:28) \\"To us, it means struggling from within the existing socio-economic and political framework.\\" But JIM insists that by adopting the homeostasis approach, it means struggling along the Malaysian mainstream based on what it terms asislah (reformation) and tadrij (stages). By islah it means launching reformation programmes at all levels, be it at the national, institutional or infrastructural levels and systems. It involves the continuing education process and the involvementin raising the consciousness and practice of the Malaysian society in activities related to Islamic principles and values that fulfil the objective of the social reformation. By tadrij it means endeavouring a change in Acts and the Federal Constitution as well as the enforcement of civil law towards absolute justice, which naturally will eventually move towards the law of Shariah (Saari Sungib 1995). JIM firmly believes that through such an approach, Malaysia will become an Islamic state in 2010 at the latest, that is ten years earlier than the governments target for a developed, industrial nation as envisaged in the nations Vision 2020. For the above reasons, JIM is not keen in transforming Malaysia into an Islamic state. To JIM, as long as the country is being ruled and administered by the Malay supremacy that respects Islam, the question of establishing an Islamic state is no more important. It is from \`respecting Islam, JIM believes, that reformation and improvement towards \`upholding Islam will happen. Thus, if the Malays are already having a strong influence in leadership and governance, it must not be disturbed and challenged (Saari Sungib 1996:45), hence JIMs non-confrontational approach.Saari Sungib, 1993.

Life Reichensperger studied law and entered government service, becoming counsellor to the court of appeal (Appellationsgerichtsrat) at Cologne in 1849. He was a member of the German parliament at Frankfurt in 1848, when he attached himself to the Right, and of the Erfurt Parliament in 1850, when he voted against the Prussian- dominated union of the German states. From 1850 to 1863 he sat in the Prussian Lower House, from 1867 to 1884 in the Reichstag, and from 1879 onwards also in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies. Originally of liberal tendencies, he developed from 1837 onwards ultramontane opinions, founded in 1852 the Catholic group which in 1861 took the name of the Centre Party and became one of its most conspicuous orators. He died at Cologne. He published a considerable number of works on art and architecture, including Die christlich-germanische Baukunst (Trier, 1852, 3rd ed., 1860); Fingerzeige auf dem Gebiete der christlichen Kunst (Leipzig, 1854); and Augustus Pugin, der Neubegr√ºnder der christlichen Kunst in England (Freiburg, 1877). His brother, Peter Reichensperger, was also active in German politics.

The name was influenced by Le Bon March√©, the noted Parisian retailer. In 1929, The Bon March√© was acquired by Hahn Department Stores, itself folded into Allied Stores a few years later. A solid middle-range store, The Bon served largely working-class Seattle. Branches were also added in several Northwestern cities. Among them were Spokane, Tacoma, Yakima, Kennewick, Longview, Walla Walla, Olympia, and Bellingham, Washington, Missoula, Montana, Great Falls, Montana, Idaho Falls, Idaho, Pocatello, Idaho, and Boise, Idaho. Commonly known to customers as The Bon, the company dropped the March√© from their name in the late 1970s before reinstating it by the mid-1980s. The Bon was known for their catchy jingles, such as the following to the tune of \\"The Banana Boat Song\\": \\"Day-o, One Day Sale, One day only at The Bon March√©! Save 20, 30, 40 percent (example savings)! Saturday only at the Bon Marche. Prices are down in every department! Saturday only at the Bon Marche!...\\" This jingle continued after the name was changed to Bon-Macy's, with the appropriate changes. In the 1960s, The Bon also used some cuts from PAMS' Series 23 jingle package, \\"Ani- Magic\\" in the 1960s. Allied Stores was merged into Federated Department Stores in 1989. As part of its national rebranding program, Federated changed the name to Bon-Macy's in 2003. On March 6, 2005, the Bon-Macy's name was eliminated, with the stores renamed as the Macy's Northwest division of Federated. On February 6, 2008, the Macy's Northwest division was merged with the Macy's West division, based in San Francisco.

Nordhoff moved to Chicago in 1881 and managed a department store in Chicago where he met his wife Josephine, who was a clerk 13 years his junior. frame The Nordhoffs leased a small storefront in modern-day Belltown at 1st Avenue and Cedar Street that cost $25 per month. They invested their entire savings account into merchandise for the store and worked to attract customers away from the city's main retail district. Josephine Nordhoff stocked shelves, kept the books, and cleaned the store; she later learned the Chinook language to wait on Native American customers. To keep customers during the economic panic of the early 1890s, the Nordhoffs stocked sacks of pennies to provide small discounts. The growing success of the store allowed the Nordhoffs to relocate closer to the business district in 1896, leasing an L-shaped building at 2nd Avenue and Pike Street. =Initial growth and expansion= The 1902 Bon March√©, pictured here in 1907‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and seen here in 1919, with the 1911 addition to the south. In 1899, at age 40, Edward died of an illness his doctor called phthisis, probably tuberculosis (Phthisis pulmonalis). Josephine remarried two years later. Her new husband, Frank McDermott, joined her and Rudolph Nordhoff, Edward's brother, in operating The Bon March√©. The store entered a period of rapid growth under the management of this trio. Sales increased from $338,000 in 1900 to $8 million in 1923.Sewell, Cynthia \\"Downtown Boise loses an anchor with Macy's closure\\" Idaho Statesman January 6, 2010. Retrieved 2010-00-21. The store was enlarged twice at its Second and Pike location, in 1902 and 1911.. The article is about a different nearby building, but mentions the dates for the rebuilding of the Bon March√©. In 1929, The Bon March√© opened at its current downtown location at Third and Pine. That year, the store was sold to Hahn Stores of Chicago, which was acquired by Allied Stores five years later. Both corporations continued to operate the store under its original name. In 1937, The Bon March√© opened its first store outside of Washington through a merger of Boise, Idaho-based C.C. Anderson's into The Bon March√© by Allied Stores. The downtown Boise store remained in operation for more than 70 years, until early 2010, albeit as a Macy's for its final few years. The Bon began opening additional stores after World War II. In 1949, it provided the anchor store for one of the world's first modern shopping centers, at Northgate Mall. By 1986, when Campeau Corporation acquired Allied Stores, the Bon March√© was one of the best-known retailers in the Northwest, with about 40 stores throughout the region. In 1978, the company acquired nine stores including Missoula Mercantile of Missoula, Montana. The Missoula store closed as Macy's in 2010.Briggeman, Kim \\"Chapter closes at old Missoula Mercantile building as Macy's to close\\" Missoulian February 5, 2010. Retrieved 2010-09-21. The Bon also opened and operated three stores in Utah: The largest one was in Ogden, at the Ogden City Mall. The second was in Layton Hills Mall in Layton, a bedroom community north of Salt Lake City. Third was the smallest store in the entire chain - Logan. This store was located in the Cache Valley Mall. The stores in Ogden and Logan were sold to Lamonts department stores in 1988 because they weren't performing well for the company. Layton's location remained open until 1993, when it was sold to After yet another change in corporate ownership in 1990, the Bon ended up in the hands of Federated Department Stores, a Cincinnati-based company which also owns the Macy's and Bloomingdales chains. In 2001, The Bon March√© debuted a prototype store in Helena, Montana. The store featured everything a typical Bon March√© had plus centralized checkouts.Batsell, Jake (November 1, 2001). \\"Bon thinking outside the box: Experimental store to offer centralized checkout, faster shopping\\". The Seattle Times, p. C1. =Name changes= Bon- Macy's logo used from 2003-2005 In August 2003, Federated \\"rebranded\\" The Bon March√©, turning it into Bon-Macy's. Federated also tacked Macy's onto the names of four other regional chains under its umbrella (Burdines in Florida, Lazarus in the Midwest, Goldsmith's in Tennessee, and Rich's in the Southeast). Customers had about a year to get used to that change when, in September 2004, Federated announced that all its regional chains would be renamed Macy‚Äôs. As of 2004, Bon-Macy's consisted of 50 stores in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. New store signs, reading simply Macy's, were in place by January 2005. The former flagship store in downtown Seattle retains one small, original example of The Bon March√© signage; this can be seen above the north entrance of the store, at the corner of 4th Ave & Olive Way. On February 6, 2008, Terry Lundgren announced the localization strategy and the company's plan to shed 2,550 jobs. This included laying off the Macy's Northwest headquarters and merging all of the former The Bon March√© stores under the Macy's West division. Macy's sold the upper 6 levels of the flagship store in 2015 to Starwood Capital. That portion of the building was remodeled into a office complex for Amazon.com. Macy's remained on the lower two floors and in the basement. On February 23, 2020, the Macy's closed the store and the building was sold to Starwood. Advertising jingle Beginning in the 1990s, The Bon March√© used an advertising jingle for its \\"One Day Sale\\" based on the song \\"Day-O\\" by Harry Belafonte. It was used in television and radio commercials into the 2000s and later entered local pop culture.

Page 1. The hero, named Horn, is the son of the king A√§lof of Suddene (probably somewhere near Devon). Horn is orphaned after the Saracens kill his parents. He and twelve companions then set sail in a boat only to end up on the shores of Brittany, where he grows to manhood and falls in love with the king's daughter Rigmel. There he defends the kingdom from invading Saracens, but the king banishes him to Ireland after he is wrongfully accused of trying to usurp the throne. In Ireland, Horn again proves his heroism and is offered the hand of the king's daughter. Horn refuses it and after some time returns to Brittany to rescue and marry Rigmel. The story became the base for one of the earliest Middle English romances King Horn, written around 1225.
