In 1889 she won the college's A. E. T. Draper medal for general scholarship and elocution. After graduating, she taught school in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1894, she passed an examination which granted her a life-time license to teach in Alabama.

James T. Haley included Lovinggood's 1894 address \\"Woman's Work in the Elevation of the Race\\" in his Afro-American Encyclopaedia (1895). In the address, Lovinggood argues that this is no difference between \\"Jews or Gentiles, black or white, male or female,\\" and that elevation of one will uplift all. She suggests that women have historically been restricted in their \\"sphere of action\\" by men who have \\"had a monopoly of everything,\\" but that some women have nevertheless \\"surmounted almost insuperable barriers and are now taken for their true worth.\\" She advocates for women to work for the betterment of humanity both inside and outside the home, to \\"study medicine, law, music, elocution and become the best in those professions.\\" For role models, Lovinggood points to women's work in medicine, anti-slavery campaigns, and suffrage. Lovinggood died in January, 1896, ten days after giving birth to a son.

Armando.info is a long-term partner of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and has worked on many projects, including the two most recent projects, Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. History Spanish national newspaper El Pa√≠s said that the world would know little of the recent turmoil in Venezuela if not for the \\"in-depth reports\\" published by Armando.Info. It reports on all matters that contribute to the crisis in Venezuela, including corruption in other countries. One report on Mexican exploitation by overpricing CLAP boxes sold to the Venezuelan government even as it was filling them with expired food products won the website the ICFJ Knight Prize. However, since the report showed weakness in the government, many of the reporters had to flee the country in exile; they continued to investigate and brought the responsible company to trial in Colombia and put on a United States watchlist. = Operaci√≥n Alacr√°n = On 1 December, Armando.info published an investigation reporting that nine parliamentaries mediated in favor of two businessmen linked with the government. After the investigation was published, the deputies Luis Parra, Jos√© Brito, Conrado P√©rez and Jos√© Gregorio \\"Goyo\\" Noriega were suspended and expelled from their parties Justice First and Popular Will. The Venezuelan opposition alleged that they were targeted by what they described as a \\"campaign of bribery and intimidation\\" by Nicol√°s Maduro's government in December 2019. Venezuelan lawmakers and the US State Department said that opposition deputies, in parties led or allied with Guaid√≥, were being offered up to US$1 million to not vote for him. Luis Parra and other opposition deputies were removed from their parties following allegations that they were being bribed by Maduro. National Assembly deputies Ismael Le√≥n and Luis Stefanelli directly accused Parra in December 2019 of attempting to bribe deputies to vote against Guaid√≥. Parra denied the allegations and said he was open to being investigated for corruption. Weeks prior to his investigation, Parra openly shared support for Guaid√≥ and promoted his protest movement. Deputy Delsa Sol√≥rzano accused Nicol√°s Maduro on CNN Radio Argentina of directing the operation. According to her, the government resorted to this method after failing to incarcerate or suspend the parliamentary immunity of the deputies, denouncing a considerable increase of political persecution as 5 January was approaching, explaining that security forces have gone to the houses of many deputies without alternates, and the only one with one, according to Sol√≥rzano, did accept the bribe. On 3 January 2020, Nicmer Evans, a Caracas-based analyst, alleged that Maduro had managed to cause 14 deputies to not cast a vote for Guaid√≥ through these tactics. Guaid√≥ theoretically controlled 112 seats in the Assembly at the time, needing 84 votes to win. Censorship On 11 September 2018, the National Commission of Telecommunications (CONATEL) banned journalists from publishing information about Alex Saab in Armando.Info, whose journalist investigations point out Saab of being allegedly involved in corruption of his business and the CLAP food distribution network. The prohibition was denounced by the Press Workers Union Syndicate, who previously also denounced that Armando Info's website was the target of massive cybernetic attacks. Journalist Roberto Deniz condemned the decision, reminding that the team had been previously threatened in Twitter and were prohibited from exiting the country.

Its full title is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with the Founder of the British Red Cross Henri Dunant. Painted in secret in Canada, it was unveiled by the Queen at Windsor Castle in October 2016 and commemorates the Queen's 60-year role as the patron of the British Red Cross.  Background  Ward was chosen to prepare the portrait as he is a long-standing supporter of the British Red Cross. The painting was influenced by previous royal portraitists including Anthony van Dyck and Joshua Reynolds. Ward painted the portrait in secret in his converted garage studio in Burlington, Ontario, using reference photographs from a two-hour session at Windsor Castle's White Drawing Room. He later remarked that passers-by would occasionally catch a glance at the work in progress and be surprised. Features In the portrait, Ward attempted to show the links between the charity and royalty through the blue Order of the Garter robes, the diamond bracelet and tiara, which were owned by the British Red Cross's first royal patron, Queen Alexandra (consort of Edward VII), and in the background a bust of Henry Dunant, founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Ward wanted to show an authentic portrayal of the Queen in her 90s. He later said, \\"I wanted a strong queen in my portrait, a queen of warmth but also of reserve.\\"  Unveiling  The painting was unveiled at Windsor Castle on 14 October 2016, by the Queen. The following month the first public viewing was planned at the Carlton Towers Hotel, Knightsbridge. It was then put on permanent display at the Savoy Hotel.

Sinead collapses and Ken is forced to tell Daniel and he did not forgive him at first but Ken's son Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) talks Daniel round. Sinead decides to undergo chemotherapy at the end of her first trimester, instead of starting aggressive radiotherapy which would require her to terminate her pregnancy. Sinead is later told that her cancer has not responded to the treatment, and that she requires an emergency caesarean section in order to save the baby and allow her to change to a different treatment. Shortly after he is born prematurely, the baby contracts an infection. After he recovers, Daniel and Sinead decide to name him Bertie, after Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth).

Producer Iain MacLeod called the family \\"funny, warm and will pull together through thick and thin\\" and expressed his joy at their castings, adding that the actors work well together. Graham expressed his delight at joining the cast and becoming part of the Bailey family. James is 19 years old and the youngest member of the Bailey family. He is a gifted footballer who plays for Weatherfield County's youth football team and is characterised as attractive, hard-working, \\"brooding\\", \\"quiet, modest and hard-working\\". He is close to his father and brother and billed as Edison's \\"pride and joy\\" and a friend to Michael. Graham called James \\"the apple of his father's eye\\" and explained that Edison wanted to be a footballer, but could not manage it, so is \\"almost living his life through James\\". In regards to his career, Graham described James as \\"very determined and driven to achieving his dreams\\" as he hopes to progress and move to better football teams. MacLeod called James \\"a fundamentally decent guy\\". James establishes a close bond with Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) after his arrival when she mistakenly tries for a relationship with him, unaware that he is gay.

James and Steve soon bond and MacLeod confirmed that James would establish friendships with Steve and Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) as they are in awe of his football connection. MacLeod noted that James would be worried about coming out to his family and that his homosexuality would affect his football career. Graham looked forward to the storylines that he would be given. It was subsequently confirmed that James would be at the centre of an issue-led story exploring homophobia in football. MacLeod did not want to portray a \\"normal coming out story where we see James wrestling with his sexuality\\", but wanted to display him worried about sharing his secret and \\"scared\\" about being open in his vocation. MacLeod also revealed that James would face an initial negative response to his sexuality from some members of his family, but they soon warm to the idea.  Ed Bailey  Edison \\"Ed\\" Bailey, played by Trevor Michael Georges, first appears in June 2019. The character and Georges' casting details were announced on 6 April 2019.

The family are introduced when they move into 3 Coronation Street and purchase the local construction yard. The family are the first black family to appear on the soap since 2013. Producer Iain MacLeod called the family \\"funny, warm and will pull together through thick and thin\\" and expressed his joy at their castings, adding that the actors work well together. Russell expressed his disbelief at joining the soap having watched the show as a child. He found it \\"humbling\\" to be featured in a script with the longest-serving character Ken Barlow (William Roache). Ed is a former property developer-turned-builder who purchases the construction yard with Michael. The character is billed as \\"a no nonsense kind of bloke who has made his own way in life\\". He is described as \\"one of the lads\\" who enjoys a pint and a laugh with his friends. Ed is extremely in love with Aggie, evidenced through his affection to her, but he also regularly moans about her lively personality as she has fun with her friends. MacLeod called Ed and Aggie \\"soulmates\\" who are loyal to their family and very friendly with each other. Ed considers James to his \\"pride and joy\\". Graham explained that Ed is \\"living his life\\" through his son since he wanted to be a footballer as a child.(He has mentioned being a fan of Arsenal F.C.) He added that to Ed, James is \\"the golden child\\". Edison also establishes friendships with Ken and Roy Cropper (David Neilson). It is revealed that Ed has a gambling addiction, which Michael tries to help him cover.  Michael Bailey  Michael Bailey, played by Ryan Russell, first appears in June 2019. Details about the character and Russell's casting details were announced on 6 April 2019. Michael is introduced as a member of the Bailey family, consisting of brothers Michael and James Bailey (Nathan Graham), and their parents, Ed Bailey (Trevor Michael Georges) and Aggie Bailey (Lorna Laidlaw). The family are introduced when they move into 3 Coronation Street and purchase the local construction yard. The family are the first black family to appear on the soap since 2013. Producer Iain MacLeod called the family \\"funny, warm and will pull together through thick and thin\\" and expressed his joy at their castings, adding that the actors work well together. Russell expressed his delight at joining the cast and portraying Michael, who he deemed to be a \\"challenge\\". Michael is 27 years old and the eldest child in the Bailey family. He is a laborer who purchases the construction yard with Edison. The character is billed as a \\"cheeky-chappy\\" who is confident, \\"endlessly optimistic\\" and \\"fiercely protective\\" of James. He is close to his mother and is described as \\"the apple of Aggie's eye\\". MacLeod called Michael \\"an exuberant, loveable dreamer with a huge heart\\". He also opined that Michael acts as the \\"glue that holds the family together\\". Michael establishes friendships with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) and Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne). Writers also gave the character a love interest as an opportunity to explore his personality. Russell explained that it would showcase how Michael is \\"not as confident as he initially makes out\\" as he struggles with his efforts to impress. On the character's romanntic advances, Russell commented, \\"Michael knows he's not the smoothest guy in the world but he can still charm someone over when given the opportunity.\\" MacLeod thought that the character and his romantic efforts were \\"endearing\\" as he is naturally charming. He described Michael as a combination of Steve, Only Fools and Horses character Del Boy (David Jason) and Four Weddings and a Funeral character Charles (Hugh Grant). Dan Seddon of entertainment website Digital Spy liked the combination and looked forward to seeing it onscreen.  Aggie Bailey  Aggie Bailey, played by Lorna Laidlaw, first appears in June 2019. The character and Laidlaw's casting details were announced on 6 April 2019. Aggie is introduced as a member of the Bailey family, consisting of brothers Michael Bailey (Ryan Russell) and James Bailey (Nathan Graham), and their parents, Aggie and Ed Bailey (Trevor Michael Georges). The family are introduced when they move into 3 Coronation Street and purchase the local construction yard. The family are the first black family to appear on the soap since 2013. Producer Iain MacLeod called the family \\"funny, warm and will pull together through thick and thin\\" and expressed his joy at their castings, adding that the actors work well together. Laidlaw expressed her excitement at joining the soap, which she called \\"a staple\\" of British television. Laidlaw was highly publicised for playing Mrs Tembe in the BBC soap opera Doctors, a role she played until leaving in February 2019. The actress was concerned about transferring from one soap to another, but thought the characters varied enough. She also revealed that she was surprised to be offered the role of Aggie. Aggie is in her 50s and is a pharmacy assistant. The character is billed as \\"friendly, fun and outrageous in equal measures\\". Laidlaw contrasted Aggie's characteristics with that of Mrs Tembe, opining that they are very different and \\"on the other end of the scale\\" to Mrs Tembe. Aggie favours Michael and considers him to be \\"the apple of [her] eye\\". Writers created an evident love and chemistry between Aggie and Edison and it is clear how in love they are with each other. MacLeod called Aggie and Edison \\"soulmates\\" who are loyal to their family and very friendly with each other. Aggie also establishes friendships with Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) and Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Upon moving into the Street, Aggie and her family end up clashing with their neighbours, the Barlows over the noise they make. This results in a noise war between Aggie and Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska) which concludes when they make peace after finding their partners in the Rovers drinking together. Aggie is next seen in the pub doing paperwork for her pharmacy job, where Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) approaches her about a rash and she is forced to try and deal with it. In August 2019, the Baileys are explored more as a family, as it is revealed why they moved to Coronation Street in the first place, having used to live in a bigger, more luxurious house. Aggie's husband, Ed secretly battled a gambling addiction and as a result, they lost their house but unable to take responsibility for his actions and admit the truth, the Bailey's eldest son, Michael took the blame and face the brunt of Aggie's anger. Aggie soon began to realise their financial hardships when her card was declined in the Corner Shop but she only discovered the actual truth when trying to throw Michael out after uncovering his fake pregnancy scam that he was dragged into operating with Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove). A heartbroken Aggie could not believe that Ed had deceived her and their family in such a way, which caused her to walk out and not come home that night. Her family waited for her the next morning, worried about where she could have got to, as she was not responding to any texts or calls that other son, James had left her. She soon returned home and told them that she had stayed at a colleague's house, one who was single and had inspirational quotes written on the walls. Ed tried to make things right with Aggie, who tried to think clearly about how they could solve and repair their current situation, not just in terms of their finance, but in their marriage. Aggie realised how much she truly loved Ed and the pair reconciled. After seeing how long the queue in Roy's Rolls was and how much Roy Cropper (David Neilson) is needing help, she volunteers her services, needing a part-time job alongside her pharmacy job to help her family get by, despite having no experience working in a cafe and not being able to cook. Roy reluctantly hires Aggie and tries to train her up, but her cooking comes under criticism from some customers, namely Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill). The criticism causes Aggie to break down crying over her family's situation, to which Roy comforts her and the pair's friendship blossoms from there. As she manages two jobs, Aggie manages to help get the Baileys back on their feet, during which time she forms friendships with several of the Street's residents, including Liz McDonald (Beverly Callard). In September 2019, Aggie decides to host a surprise birthday party for Ed to celebrate and manages to get several of the Street's residents involved and the surprise leaves Ed delighted. Aggie is forced to stand by as Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) has too much to drunk and makes a scene, which leads to him being escorted out of the Bailey house by his loved ones. Following the party, Michael has become suspicious of James after overhearing him with Bethany, agreeing to a fake relationship. James soon comes out to Michael as gay, but fears that publicly coming out will put the spotlight on him and ruin his career as a professional footballer. It is soon revealed that Aggie has known about James' sexuality for years, due to her maternal nature and motherly instincts. Aggie also reveals that the other Bailey child, Dee Dee is also aware of James being gay. Aggie then tells James that everyone now knows in the family apart from Ed and she doesn't want that, so she urges James to come clean and tell Ed the truth, despite James being fearful of Ed's reaction. James tells Aggie that he will do it in his own time. On Christmas Day 2019, whilst leaving the house with James, they are confronted by Derek Milligan, who is armed with a gun and has just fled the Rovers. Held at gunpoint, Aggie manages to talk Derek around to not opening fire on her and James. She is alerted by Derek to the fact that Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) has been accidentally shot by him. After Derek gets distracted, Aggie and James rush to help Robert, in which Aggie rings for an ambulance and tries to save Robert's life. Robert soon dies from an undetected heart attack in hospital, which leaves Aggie feeling guilty as she felt she could have done more to help save his life. It is soon revealed that Aggie in fact used to be a nurse, but for some reason, she quit the profession. Following her actions on Christmas Day, Aggie discovers that James has put her forward for the Weatherfield Hearts award for her bravery and actions in helping Robert on Christmas Day. In January 2020, Aggie opens up to Roy about why she left nursing. She reveals that a patient died and she felt responsible, despite it not being her fault. This led to increased paranoia whilst at work, as she would check things several times and she began to doubt herself, which caused her confidence to crumble and as a result, she quit. Roy suggests that she could maybe go back to nursing, which Aggie considers but doesn't know if she has the courage to go through with it. In February 2020, Aggie is at the forefront with her family as James finally comes out to Ed and on top of that, reveals that he has been having a secret relationship with Danny, a longtime friend of Ed's. Ed is extremely hurt by this and has a negative reaction with James, one that angers James and devastates Aggie. Aggie urges Ed to reconsider his old fashioned views and tells him that all James wants is his love and support. The Baileys later attend the Weatherfield Hearts Awards where Aggie collects her award, having won for her actions of bravery. She dedicates her award to her family. Aggie later announces to her family that she has decided to return to nursing and as a result, stops working at Roy's Rolls. On her first day back in March 2020, Ed tries to speak to James and tells him that for one day, they can pull together as a family to celebrate Aggie's return to nursing. The Baileys later meet in the pub, but it's clear that the relationship between Ed and James is very fraught. In April 2020, Ed and Aggie celebrated the anniversary of their first meeting and tried to have a romantic night in together with a candlelit dinner, however this was disrupted by a party hosted at No.1 next door, which led to Aggie calling the police due to the noise and vandalism of their own garden. In May 2020, Ed and Michael begin to suffer racism from the Bistro's new manager, Don. Michael wants to react to the comments made by Don, however Ed insists that they have to pick and choose what arguments to involve themselves in and if they react, then they won't get paid. Aggie stands by Ed, recongising the generational gap between them and their children in terms of experiences of racism. The Baileys soon reluctantly decide to attend the relaunch of the Bistro, where Don continues to make comments at the Bailey family. This finally leads Ed to snap and he lectures Don on his behaviour and talks about his experiences of racism as Aggie and several other street residents watch on. Heading to the Rovers, Ed and Aggie are approached by several residents who commemorate Ed for his actions against Don. Aggie soon tells Ed that if he can recognize racist behaviour towards their family, then he needs to stand by James, as he will face prejudice for his own sexuality, which has been rumoured in the press but he denied when questioned about it. Aggie is delighted when Ed and James make amends with each other. Aggie is later seen at the hospital, where she tries to support her friend, Liz, who's grandson, Oliver has been admitted after having several seizures.

Hazlegrove expressed her delight at her casting and recalled how she began her acting career on Coronation Street, having portrayed Sue Clayton in 1985. On Hazlegrove's casting, a show spokesperson commented, \\"We are very pleased that the fantastic Jane Hazlegrove has agreed to join the cast as the irrepressible and impossible Gemma's even more irrepressible and impossible mother. Fur will fly!\\" Hazlegrove began filming in May 2019. The first image of Hazlegrove in the role of Bernie was released on 1 June 2019. Joe Anderton of Digital Spy thought that the actress appeared \\"almost unrecognisable\\" as Bernie and quipped that she had been \\"Gemma'd\\".

Her backstory states that she struggled as a parent to Gemma and Paul, having repeatedly let them down as she embarked on a \\"party lifestyle\\". She is first mentioned in April 2019 when Bernie fails to support Gemma after she plans to leave Weatherfield, the show's fictional setting. Bernie arrives to support Gemma through her pregnancy and prove herself as a mother. While Gemma is pleased to see her, Paul is \\"suspicious of her motives\\". Campbell believed that Bernie's arrival would supply \\"a real insight into what made Gemma the person she is today\\".

He is a businessman and the client of Gary Windass (Mikey North), who ends up blackmailing Derek in collaborating with his scheme to invest in the \\"Underworld Factory\\"; with Derek being implied to owe Gary in debt to him. Derek initially complies to Gary's demands, but later attempts to stand up for him - up to the point where he nearly ruins his scheme altogether. In retribution, Gary holds Derek captive until Christmas Eve that year in order to destroy his last-efforts of reconciling with his ex-wife and their children. The following day on Christmas 2019, Derek - seeking revenge on Gary - steals a gun from his shop and ends up causing a siege at the local public house, \\"The Rovers Return Inn\\", in an attempt to confront Gary. When Gary appears, Derek fires the gun to prove his intent on killing Gary - though he unknowingly ends up shooting one of Gary's neighbors, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill), in the process; Robert is later hospitalized and passes away from his injuries. When Gary flees, Derek pursues him to a theme park where they end up having a fight; which ends with Derek tumbling off the roof after shooting Gary and a local resident, Shona Platt (Julia Goulding), during the struggle. Gary attempts to bring Derek up to safety, but loses his grip and watches as Derek falls off a roof. He is later pronounced dead and his body is taken away.

Fiz and her fianc√© Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) are delighted by Jade's presence around the house, however, Tyrone's grandmother Evelyn Plummer (Maureen Lipman) is suspicious of Jade's motives. Knowing that Evelyn disagrees with Fiz's parenting methods, Jade expresses her annoyance with the way Fiz is treating Hope. However, Evelyn sides with Fiz. As a result, Jade leaves and visits the grave of John Stape (Graeme Hawley), revealing that she is John's daughter. When Fiz and Tyrone realise that Jade is John's daughter, they kick her out. When Hope goes missing, they assume Jade has taken her and call the police; however, Jade later finds Hope at John's grave. When Fiz confronts Jade, she strikes her over the head, leaving her unconscious in her living room; Jade escapes, and returns weeks later in a bid to seduce Tyrone. She threatens to tell the police about the assault so she can take care of Hope, but Hope stands up for her parents, and Jade leaves. On 29 December 2019, it was announced that Henshall would be leaving the soap and Jade would depart at the conclusion of her storyline. Jade departed on 4 March 2020. Aled, Carys, Llio and Bryn Winter-Brown Aled, Carys, Llio and Bryn Winter-Brown are the quadruplet children of Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell). The concept of the characters was announced in May 2019. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap that the quadruplets' introduction would spark the exposure of \\"a more vulnerable side to Gemma\\", adding, \\"Typically, Gemma and Chesney have very different ideas on parenting, so how will the pair cope with the new four arrivals?\\" The following month, it was confirmed that eight babies would be cast to portray the quadruplets. They are born in a cable car during a holiday break in Llandudno, Wales. Aled is the eldest child, followed by Carys and Llio, making Bryn the youngest child.

It is currently empty. The May Company Building at Mission Valley was designed in 1959 and opened in 1961. It was designed by William S.

However the report stated that the building did not qualify because of the lack of integrity of the original construction, due to replacement of some original tiles, altered walls, covering up of the building by new retail space set in front of it, removal of original pop-out display windows and \\"May Co.\\" signage, and demolition of the 1958 canopy and columns, thus all together the alteration of more than 50% of the surface area of the original building exterior.

Klaus (June 6, 1927 ‚Äì August 15, 2017) was a neonatologist who studied the effects of maternal bonding after birth.  Biography  Marshall Henry Klaus was born on June 6, 1927, in Lakewood, Ohio to Dr. Max Henry Klaus and Caroline Epstein. As a child, his parents passed away and Klaus and his brother went to live with their uncle, a physician. He graduated from Case Western Reserve University Medical School specializing in pediatric pulmonology and neonatal development. A bout with polio left Kraus with a weakened right arm, so he chose a specialization that would be physically possible for him. In 1950, he married Lois Krieger, a chemist, with whom he had five children. The couple later divorced. He completed is residency in 1954 at Children's Hospital in Cleveland. During his year as Chief Resident, the hospital opened a ward for parents to stay with their children and was interested in the better patient care and satisfaction. In 1961, he completed a Pulmonary Medicine Fellowship at the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF) and moved took the position as Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University. In 1967, he became the Neonatal Director and in 1973 published his first book \\"Care of the High Risk Neonate\\" which established the discipline of Neonatology by introducing \\"new material via case problems and included expert commenters debating alternate lines of therapy where there was not yet a solid evidence base.\\" While studying mechanical ventilation at Stanford University, he noticed that mothers of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit had trouble bonding and with colleague Dr. John H. Kennell began to study maternal bonding after birth. In 1976, Klaus and Kennell published ‚ÄúMaternal-Infant Bonding‚Äù concluding that a mother's attachment to her baby is stronger if able to bond in the first few hours after birth. Bonding after birth was said to increase breastfeeding, enhance child development, and reduces child abuse. The research came under criticism with opponents citing the inherent problems studying human behavior and claiming that the improved bonding effect is small and limited. Many hospitals began to change their procedures to give new parents time with their infants, allow partners in the delivery room, and the baby's siblings to visit based on the book's recommendations. In 1984, he was awarded the C. Anderson Aldrich Award for their contributions to the field of child development from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). In 1973, Klaus and Kennell were studying bonding in Guatemala where they noticed that when a female student stayed with the laboring mother, the labor was shorter. After a formal study in 1980, their research found that with supportive labor companions, or doulas, a woman's labor was shorter, discomfort and a need for a cesarean were decreased, and maternal bonding was increased. Their findings were published in the paper \\"Effects Of Social Support During Parturition On Maternal And Infant Morbidity.\\" During his early studies of doulas, Klaus met Phyllis Stoller, whom he married in 1982. In 1992, Klaus and his wife Phyllis joined with Kennell, Penny Simkin, and Annie Kennedy to form the first doula certifying organization, Doulas of North America. In 2002, the AAP named a grant in his honor, the Marshall Klaus Perinatal Research Awards, for neonatal fellows. He died on August 15, 2017 in Palo Alto, California.

Macromolecular cage architectures come in various sizes ranging from 1-50 nm and have varying topologies as well as functions. They can be synthesized through covalent bonding or self-assembly through non-covalent interactions. Most macromolecular cages that are formed through self-assembly are sensitive to pH, temperature, and solvent polarity.  Metal Organic Polyhedra  right Metal Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) comprise a specific type of self-assembled macromolecular cage that is formed through unique coordination and is typically chemically and thermally stable. MOPs have cage-like frameworks with an enclosed cavity. The discrete self-assembly of metal ions and organic scaffolds to form MOPs into highly symmetrical architectures, is a modular process and has various applications. The self- assembly of various subunits that result in high symmetry is a common occurrence in biological systems. Specific examples of this are ferritin, capsid, and the tobacco mosaic virus, which are formed by the self-assembly of protein subunits into a polyhedral symmetry. Nonbiological polyhedra formed with metal ions and organic linkers are metal based macromolecular cages that have nanocavities with multiple openings or pores that allow small molecules to permeate and pass through. MOPs have been used to encapsulate a number of guests through various host-guest interactions (e.g. electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and steric interactions). MOPs are biomimetic materials that have potential for biomedical and biochemical applications. In order for the cage to work effectively and have biomedical relevance, it has to be chemically stable, biocompatible, and needs to operate mechanistically in aqueous media. Macromolecular cages in general can be used for a variety of applications (e.g. nanoencapsulation, biosensing, drug delivery, regulation of nanoparticle synthesis, and catalysis).  Cage Shaped Polymers  There are also a class of macromolecular cages that are synthetically formed through covalent bonding as opposed to self-assembly. Through the covalent-bond- forming strategy the cage molecules can be synthesized methodically with customizable functionality and regulated cavity size. Cage-shaped polymers are macromolecular analogues of molecular cages such as cryptand. A cage molecule of this type can be tuned by the degree of polymerization. The polymers that are typically used to make the polymer based macromolecular cages are made with star shaped polymers or nonlinear polymer precursors. The molecular size of the polymeric macromolecular cage is controlled by the molecular weight of the star-shaped polymer or branched polymer. The macromolecular cages made from non-linear polymers are designed to have molecular recognition, respond to external stimuli and self-assemble into higher order structures.  Fullerenes  Fullerenes are a class of carbon allotropes that were first discovered in 1985 and are also an example of macromolecular cages. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) and the 60 atoms of this molecule are arranged in a cage-like structure and the framework resembles a soccer ball; the molecule has an icosahedral symmetry. C60 has versatile applications due to its macromolecular cage structure; for example, it can be used for water purification, catalysis, bio-pharmaceuticals, serve as a carrier of radionuclides for MRI, and drug delivery.  Macromolecular Cage Architecture in Biology  The RNA exosome is a biomolecular cage that has nuclease activity which catalyzes the breakdown of RNA molecules. Shown above is the whole RNA exosome with a helical protein framework and a central chamber where RNA degradation takes place. Depicted is the tobacco mosaic virus protein coat; virus protein coats known as capsids are examples of macromolecular cages in nature. The protein shell encapsulates a hollow chamber which contains the viral genomic information. Ferritin is a hollow sphere that has an outer diameter close to 12 nm and an inner diameter of 7-8 nm. The inner chamber of ferritin uptakes or binds iron in its ferrous state and stores iron in its ferric or trivalent state. There are many examples of highly symmetrical macromolecular cage motifs known as protein cages in biological systems. The term protein cage delineates a diverse range of protein structures that are formed by the self-assembly of protein subunits into hollow macromolecular nanoparticles. These protein cages are nanoparticles that have one or more cavities present in their structure. The size of the cavity contributes to the size of the particle that the cavity can enclose, for example inorganic nanoparticles, nucleic acids, and even other proteins. The interior or chamber portion of the protein cage is usually accessible through a pore which is located in between protein subunits. The RNA exosome has nuclease active sites that are present in a cavity where 3' RNA degradation takes place; access to this cavity is controlled by a pore and this serves to prevent uncontrollable RNA decay. Some protein cages are dynamic structures that assemble and disassemble in response to external stimuli. Other examples of protein cages are clathrin cages, viral envelopes, chaperonins, and the iron storage protein ferritin.  Synthetic Strategies to form Macromolecular Cages  There are various methods used to form polymeric macromolecular cages. One synthetic method uses ring opening and multiple click chemistry in the first step to form trefoil and quatrefoil-shaped polymers, which can then be topologically converted into cages using hydrogenolysis. The initiator in this synthesis is azido and hydroxy functionalized p-xylene and the monomer is butylene oxide. The ring opening polymerization and simultaneous click cyclizations of butylene oxide with the initiator is catalyzed by t-Bu-P4. This synthetic strategy was used to form cage-shaped polybutylene oxides; cage-shaped block copolymers are also formed using a similar method. One synthetic strategy utilizes atom transfer radical polymerization and click chemistry methods to form figure eight and cage- shaped polystyrene; in this case the precursor is nonlinear polystyrene. Another synthetic strategy employs intramolecular ring-opening metathesis oligomerization of a star polymer and this reaction method is catalyzed by diluted Grubb's third generation catalyst. Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have also been used to form cage architectures and in one such example Schiff base cyclization was used to form the macromolecular cage molecule. In this synthesis 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and (R,R)-(1,2)-diphenylethylenediamine undergo cycloimination in dichloromethane with trifluoroacetic acid as a catalyst to form a COF cage molecule. Macrocyclizations have also been employed to form peptoid based macromolecular cages, the specific methodology utilizes a one pot synthesis to form steroid-aryl hybrid cages using two- and three-fold Ugi type macrocyclization reactions. = Genetically engineered macromolecular cages made from biomolecules = Macromolecular cages can also be formed synthetically using biomolecules. Protein cages can be genetically engineered, and the outside of the cage can be tailored with synthetic polymers, which is known as protein-polymer conjugation. Preformed polymer chains can be attached to the surface of the protein using chemical linkers. Polymerization can also occur from the protein surface, and the polymer can also be bound to the surface of protein cages via electrostatic interactions. The purpose of this modification is to make synthetic protein cages more biocompatible; this post synthetic modification makes the protein cage less susceptible to an immune response and stabilizes the cage from degradation from proteases. Virus-like protein (VLP) cages have also been synthesized and recombinant DNA technology is used to form non-native virus-like proteins. The first reported case of the formation of non-native VLP constructs into a capsid-like structure utilized a functionalized gold core for nucleation. The self-assembly of the VLP was initiated by the electrostatic interaction of the functionalized gold nanoparticles which is similar to the interaction of a native virus with its nucleic acid component. These viral protein cages have potential applications in biosensing and medical imaging. DNA origami is another strategy to form macromolecular cages or containers. In one case, a 3D macromolecular cage with icosahedral symmetry (resembling viral capsids) was formed based on the synthetic strategy in 2D origami. The structure had an inside volume or hollow cavity encased by triangular faces, similar to a pyramid. This close-faced cage was designed to potentially encapsulate other materials such as proteins and metal nanoparticles.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The Leigh 30 design is similar to the Morris 30 and the Victoria 30, all Paine designs built by Morris Yachts in the same timeframe. Production The design was built by Morris Yachts in Bass Harbor, Maine, United States. The company built 19 examples of the design, starting in 1979, but it is now out of production. Design The Leigh 30 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a cutter rig, a raked stem, a canoe transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel with the forefoot cutaway. A wheel was optional. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Westerbeke diesel engine of for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The boats were built with a variety of lower deck layouts, but typical is a galley on the port side with a two-burner kerosene stove, top- loading ice box and a sink with manual water pump. The head is located just aft of the bow \\"V\\"-berth, with a hanging locker opposite. There is additional sleeping accommodation in the main cabin, with a starboard pilot berth, a settee and very small port side berth. The wood used in the interior is pine and mahogany, with additional painted wood. Teak is employed above decks. Ventilation is provided by nine bronze ports that open, plus two hatches, one over the main cabin and the other in the bow. The cockpit has two main winches, plus a halyard winch and additional sheeting winch on the coach house roof. There are inboard genoa tracks and a bow roller for a CQR anchor on the bow. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 192. Operational history In a review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"The Leigh is moderate displacement, but the ballast/displacement ratio is 48 percent and she is stiff. The high freeboard is extended by bulwarks, making for a dry boat. The keel is moderately long, the forefoot cut away, and the sail plan balanced, so she should steer easily.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alberg 30 *Alberg Odyssey 30 *Aloha 30 *Annie 30 *Bahama 30 *Bristol 29.9 *C&C; 30 *C&C; 30 Redwing *Catalina 30 *Catalina 309 *CS 30 *Grampian 30 *Hunter 30 *Hunter 30T *Hunter 30-2 *Mirage 30 *Mirage 30 SX *Nonsuch 30 *O'Day 30 *Pearson 303 *S2 9.2 *Santana 30/30 *Seafarer 30 *Southern Cross 28 *Tanzer 31 References Keelboats 1970s sailboat type designs Sailing yachts ","title":"Leigh 30"},{"id":"60502899","text":"Gary Moores (born 4 April 1959) is a British wrestler.

By the time it was extinguished, the building's spire collapsed and most of its roof had been destroyed and its upper walls severely damaged. Extensive damage to the interior was prevented by its stone vaulted ceiling, which largely contained the burning roof as it collapsed. Many works of art and religious relics were moved to safety early in the emergency, but others suffered some smoke damage, and some exterior art was damaged or destroyed. The cathedral's altar, two pipe organs, and its three 13th-century rose windows suffered little to no damage. Three emergency workers were injured. Contamination of the site and the nearby environment resulted. French president Emmanuel Macron said that the cathedral would be restored by 2024, and launched a fundraising campaign which brought in pledges of over ‚Ç¨1billion . A complete restoration could require twenty years or more. On 25 December 2019, the cathedral did not host Christmas services for the first time since 1803. Background The Catholic cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris (\\"Our Lady of Paris\\"), part of the \\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\\" UNESCO World Heritage Site, was begun in the 12th century. Its walls and interior vaulted ceiling are of stone; its roof and fl√®che (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water. The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century. The cathedral's stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water. The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age. In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at ‚Ç¨150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise ‚Ç¨100million over the following five to ten years. At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept. Extensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral. The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily. Fire From Square Ren√©-Viviani at 19:51 Fire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral's roof at 18:18. At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; (archive copy legible if javascript turned off) a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong locationthe attic of the adjoining sacristywhere he found no fire. About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced. The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned. Firefighters arrived within ten minutes. Police evacuated the √éle de la Cit√©. White smoke rising from the roof turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow. =Firefighting= The spire aflame Firefighters using a deluge gun More than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred worked to move precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers. The fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800¬∞C or 1500¬∞F) inwards. Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents. Water was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine. Aerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled. Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots for visual imaging and directing water streams. Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters. By 18:52, smoke was visible from outside; flames appeared in the next ten minutes, as firefighters arrived. The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic. Firefighters then retreated from within the attic. Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported eight very large bells. Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral. At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers. By 21:45 the fire was under control. Adjacent apartment buildings were evacuated due to concern about possible collapse, but on 19 April the fire brigade ruled out that risk. One firefighter and two police officers were injured. =Damage= Animation showing the south facade before and after the fire; scaffolding had been erected as part of renovations underway when the fire started. crossing and two other cells of vaulting collapsed The roof reduced to piles of char atop the mostly intact vaults Most of the wood/metal roof and the spire of the cathedral was destroyed, with about one third of the roof remaining. The remnants of the roof and spire fell atop the stone vault underneath, which forms the ceiling of the cathedral's interior. Some sections of this vaulting collapsed in turn, allowing debris from the burning roof to fall to the marble floor below, but most sections remained intact due to the use of rib vaulting, greatly reducing damage to the cathedral's interior and objects within. The cathedral contained a large number of artworks, religious relics, and other irreplaceable treasures, including a crown of thorns said to be the one Jesus wore at his crucifixion, a purported piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the Tunic of St. Louis, a much-rebuilt pipe organ by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll, and the 14th- century Virgin of Paris statue. Some artwork had been removed in preparation for the renovations, and most of the cathedral's sacred relics were held in the adjoining sacristy, which the fire did not reach; all the cathedral's relics survived. Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants. Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April. Lead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged. One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping. Several pews were destroyed and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church's main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it. Some paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration. A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations. The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris. The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged. The largest of the cathedral's bells, the bourdon, was not damaged. The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the \\"grands Mays\\" paintings were moved to safety. Environmental damage Airparif said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor. It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby. The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire. The burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead. Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire. Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area. People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the lead precautions required for their own protection; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down. There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism. Average lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit (1000 Œºg/m2), due to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs. The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m2 indoors. There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L'Agence r√©gionale de sant√© (ARS) d'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire. This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action. In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m2 to 5000. Rain can redistribute the lead dust. =Reactions= H√¥tel de Ville in homage to the cathedral and those who helped save it Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre Dame and gave a brief address there. Numerous world religious and government leaders extended condolences. Through the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray. The following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire. Investigation The fire seen from Pont de la Tournelle On 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act. The fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them. Renovation works increase fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident. The renovations presented a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and welding lead sheets resting on timber). Normally, no electrical installations were allowed in the roof space due to the extreme fire risk. The roof framing was of very dry timber, often powdery with age. After the fire the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control. Of the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire. The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting. Le Bras Fr√®resLe Bras Fr√®res , a company specialized in roofing including for heritage roofing restoration. said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out. Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire. On 25 April, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of electric bell-ringing apparatus, and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding. Le Bras Fr√®res (the roofing company) confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire. The Paris prosecutor's office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive. The security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived. Additionally, the fire security system used confusing terminology in its referencing parts of the cathedral, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire. As of September, five months after the fire, investigators thought the cause of the fire was more likely an electrical fault than a cigarette. Determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work. By 15 April 2020, investigators believed \\"the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system\\". Reconstruction Chartres Cathedral was rebuilt with wrought iron trusses and copper sheeting after an 1836 fire. On the night of the fire Macron said that the cathedral, which is owned by the state, would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign. France's cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured. The heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros; but, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry. European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which currently is estimated around ‚Ç¨7billion. This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral; art insurers said any pieces on loan from other museums would have been insured, but the works owned by the cathedral would not have been insurable. While Macron hoped the cathedral could be restored in time for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, architects expect the work could take from twenty to forty years, as any new structure would need to balance restoring the look of the original building, using wood and stone sourced from the same regions used in the original construction, with the structural reinforcement required for preventing a similar disaster in the future. There is discussion of whether to reconstruct the cathedral in modified form. Rebuilding the roof with titanium sheets and steel trusses has been suggested; other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones. White tarpaulins over metal beams were quickly rigged to protect the interior from the elements. Nettings protect the destabilised exterior. French prime minister √âdouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire \\"adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.\\" The spire replacement project has gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules. After the design competition was announced, the French senate amended the government's restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire. This amendment awaits approval by the National Assembly of France. On 16 July, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral's roof and central spire, the law that will govern the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the French parliament. It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to \\"preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument\\", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum. On 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore \\"some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level\\" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals. Monika Gr√ºtters, Germany's Commissioner for Culture was quoted as saying \\"her country would shoulder the costs\\". =Fundraising= , donations of over ‚Ç¨1billion have been pledged for the cathedral's reconstruction, at least ‚Ç¨880million of that in less than a day after Macron's appeal. Pledges ‚Ç¨10M and over include: There have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts. A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry. Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions. Those who do not pay income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including many working- and middle-class donors) are not eligible for tax deductions. , only ‚Ç¨80million had been collected. The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful. One year after the fire, from an estimated 320,000 contributors, close to ‚Ç¨1 billion had been received.

History  The Elizabeth House was founded in 1988 and is named after a volunteer veteran Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Colnaghi. In the 1970s, Colnaghi began using her basement as a food pantry to serve low-income residents of the Laurel area. This later grew to include emergency financial aid and transportation. The Elizabeth House serves people in Prince George's County, Howard County, and Anne Arundel County. The number of people supported by the organization has grown since its foundation. Boy Scouts of America collect donations that provide additional support in the holiday season. In August 1995, Elizabeth House served approximately 50 to 75 homeless people a night. According to Laurel officials, in 1995, the Elizabeth House served roughly 70 to 90 people annually. In November 2011, the Elizabeth House provides three bags of groceries to 20 families a week and 40 bagged lunches a week. In total, its 240 bags of groceries and 1,120 hot meals and bagged lunches a month. The former Laurel Mall hosted food drives to benefit the Elizabeth House. = Criticism = Since the 1990s, leadership at the Elizabeth House has disputed with City of Laurel Officials including City Administrator Ernest Saccanelli and Police Chief Roy Gilmore over how to best help the homeless population. Elizabeth House director, Robert Colnaghi stated that the two officials told him \\"we should not serve those people from Howard County that we're a magnet for homeless people from Anne Arundel, Howard and Montgomery counties.\\" Saccanelli believes the services offered by social programs including the Elizabeth House attract more homeless to the city.

At least 20,136 people in London and surrounding parishes were recorded to have died of plague during the outbreak. Around 24% of London's population ultimately perished, but the plague affected London's insanitary parishes and neighborhoods the most. London in 1563 In 1563 the City of London was overcrowded, unsanitary, and poorly-policed. Queen Elizabeth reigned in her 5th year and the government struggled with a rapidly increasing population. Although sanitation was a constant problem, the city had gone over a dozen years without a plague epidemic and many contemporary Londoners were unconcerned about the disease. That changed in 1563 when plague suddenly erupted in Derby, Leicester, and London with such virulence that sickness spread to English troops garrisoned at Havre, weakening them and causing a surrender to French forces. The plague in London Queen Elizabeth led the response to the epidemic with cooperation between the government and Church. The first cases of plague began to appear in June. According to manuscripts by John Stow kept at Lambeth Library, weekly bills of mortality for 1563 show the first 17 recorded plague deaths for the week ending 12 June. Elizabeth began coordinating a government response to the epidemic by communicating orders to her people through the Church. Churchwardens and curates were instructed to tell parishioners staying with those sick with plague not to come to church until several weeks after they die or recover. Strict countermeasures were taken at the local level to combat the epidemic such as painting blue crosses on the houses of the infected and government orders to kill and bury all stray cats and dogs \\"for the avoidance of plague,\\" with special officers appointed to carry out the cull. Many people still believed that plague was caused by inhaling corrupt airs known as \\"miasmas.\\" In another well-intentioned but likely ineffective effort to cleanse London, orders were given by Queen Elizabeth's Council on 9 July that all householders at seven in the evening should make bonfires in the street to consume the corrupt air. Cases began to steadily increase over the next few weeks, with plague killing 131 Londoners for the week ending 3 July before sharply increasing to hundreds of deaths per week by 30 July. Tudor physician William Bullein records the contemporary testimony of a beggar witnessing those fleeing the epidemic: \\"I met with wagons, cartes, and horses full loden with young barnes, for fear of the black Pestilence...\\" The urban neighborhoods within London's walls were among the hardest hit by the epidemic of 1563, with the worst afflicted areas being Saint Poulkar's parish, Fleet Ditch's Turnagain lane, and Seacoal lane. S. Poulkar's was the most severely affected parish, having large quantities of fruit merchandise and filth in the lanes attracting rats. The areas around Fleet river were notorious for being overcrowded and unsanitary, and plague spread wildly in these localities. A prominent London physician named Dr. Geynes, known for invoking Galen and being citationed by the government for it, died on 23 July from plague. Another physician, Dr. John Jones, contracted plague after staying in the house of a sick person but survived the illness. Dr. Jones promotes the theory of contagion in his Dyall of Auges, writing that \\"I myself was infected by reason that unawares I lodged with one who had it running from him.\\" As London's death toll soared, fear of the plague became palpable in the Royal Court. On 21 August, Lord Burleigh drafted Queen Elizabeth's order for the removal of Lady Katherine Grey and the Earl of Hertford from the Tower, out of \\"great fear that [the plague] may enter into our said Tower.\\" By the end of August nearly 1,000 Londoners per week were dying, and London was experiencing widespread panic. Elizabeth and the Royal Council decided to avoid the City of London entirely. The Queen moved the Royal Court to Windsor Castle and erected a gallows in the town square, threatening to hang anyone who followed them from London. She prudently banned the transportation of goods into Windsor from London, as she too had a fear of contagion. A pious queen, Elizabeth also wrote to the Archbishop of York to recommend universal prayer and fasting for hastening \\"remedy and mitigation\\" of the plague in her realm. =Autumn peak and winter decline= An average of 1,449 people were dying weekly between 27 August and 1 October, peaking at 1,828 plague deaths in London for the week ending 1 October. Queen Elizabeth's government gave new orders on 30 September that all houses with infected individuals should have their doors and windows boarded up and that no person inside shall make contact with persons outside for 40 days. This strict quarantine may have had an immediate effect, with plague deaths the next week dropping over 30% to 1,262 for the week ending 8 October. It is normal during plague outbreaks for the disease to subside or break in a community during the winter months, as rats and their fleas retreat from snow and their resources thin out. By 2 December deaths had fallen to 178 per week and the Common Council released an order that none of the houses where plague patients had been can be rented out. Cases continued to decline to 13 deaths for the week ending 21 January 1564 before plague dissipated from the city.

The black dog breezed through the competition remained going unbeaten into the final. As the only wide runner in the final he took a decisive lead on the second bend to win a first Derby for his trainer Charlie Lister. The time of 28.23 was the fastest time ever for a Wimbledon Stadium Derby final.

The basin covers an area of 150,000 square kilometers and spans from southeastern South Australia to southwestern Victoria, with 80% lying offshore in water depths ranging from 50-3,000 meters. Otway represents a passive margin rift basin and is one of a series of basins located along the Australian Southern Rift System. The basin dates from the late Jurassic to late Cretaceous periods and formed by multi-stage rifting during the breakup of Gondwana and the separation of the Antarctic and Australian plates. The basin contains a significant amount of natural gas and is a current source of commercial extraction.  Tectonic setting  The Otway Basin developed along the Australian Southern Rift System during late Jurassic to Cenozoic breakup of eastern Gondwana as Antarctica began rifting away from Australia. The basin lies at the transition from a normal-obliquely rifted continental margin to the west to a transform continental margin to the southeast. This transition zone is dominated by transtensional faulting that contributes to the basin's complex structural and depositional history. The margin developed through repeated episodes of extension and thermal subsidence leading up to, and following, the commencement of seafloor spreading between Australian and Antarctica.  Structural elements  The basin includes five significant depocenters. The Inner Otway Basin, Torquay Sub-basin, Morum Sub- basin, Nelson Sub-basin, and Hunter Sub-basin formed as a result of two major, basin-wide rifting phases. At the onset of major north-south rifting in the late Jurassic several east-west trending extensional depocenters developed in the onshore part of the basin to define the Inner Otway Basin. Renewed rifting in the late Cretaceous was driven by a change in crustal extension style from north-south to northeast-southwest resulting in the structurally different, northwest-southeast trending Torquay, Morum, Nelson, and Hunter Sub-basins in the mid- and off-shore. Following each rifting episode the basin underwent compressional phases resulting in the inversion and wrenching of pre-existing structures. Stratigraphy of the Otway Basin, Australia from Robson et al. (2018)  Tectonostratigraphic evolution  Eight distinct and regionally mappable stratigraphic groups define the Otway Basin fill. = Initial rifting (Early Cretaceous) = Basin rift system initiated at the onset of north-south extension between the Australian and Antarctic plates in the late Jurassic. Growing extensional structures were filled with ~5000 meters of continental and fluvio-lacustrine sediments that comprise the Crayfish Group. In the Aptian the basin experienced widespread thermal subsidence where ~4000 meters of fluvial and lacustrine sediments of the Eumeralla Formation were deposited in the progressively widening sag basin. = Compression and uplift (Mid Cretaceous) = The first phase of rifting ceased in the Albian at which time the basin underwent an erosive compressional period leading to the basin wide Otway unconformity. = Renewed rifting (Late Cretaceous) = After a 6.5 Ma hiatus, rifting renewed and rift-related subsidence began in the Turonian. This rifting phase is marked by a change in crustal extension direction from north-south to northeast-southwest resulting in the deposition of large and deep depocenters in the mid- and off-shore basin. Syn-rift deposition includes ~1300 meters of fluvial and deltaic sediments that comprise the Shipwreck Group. A major marine transgression in the Campanian produced ~5000 meters of deltaic and marine Sherbrook Group sediments. = Continental breakup (Late Maastrichtian) = In the late Cretaceous rifting transitioned to seafloor spreading marking the onset of post-rift passive margin conditions within the Otway Basin. As Australian-Antarctic plate clearance continued and the passive margin developed further the basin experienced widespread thermal subsidence leading to an increase in accommodation space. Deposition from the late Maastrichtian to present day is marked by a succession of marine and carbonate accumulations of the Wangerrip, Nirranda, Heytesbury, and Whalers Bluff Groups, separated by distinct unconformities associated with basin-wide compression events.

His Fantasia in F minor D 940 is dedicated to her.  Biography  The Countess was born in 1805, in Pressburg, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Bratislava in Slovakia) to J√°nos K√°roly, Count Esterh√°zy de Gal√°ntha and Countess R√≥za Festetics de Tolna. By birth she was a member of the wealthy and illustrious Esterh√°zy family. She received music lessons from Franz Schubert during the summers of 1818 and 1824 on her family estate at Zseliz (today ≈Ωeliezovce). To judge from her collection of music scores and the markings in them, it appears she was an accomplished pianist. After the summer of 1824, she and Schubert remained friends until his death in 1828. On 8 April 1844, she married Count Karl Folliott de Crenneville-Poutet, but the marriage broke down within a few months and the couple separated. She died in Pressburg on 14 March 1851, from an intestinal disorder.  Relationship with Schubert  The nature of Schubert's feelings for the countess has been the subject of much speculation. Schubert's friends believed him to be in unrequited love with the young countess, and there are a number of references to this in their writings. Eduard von Bauernfeld wrote of his friend: \\"He was, in fact, head over heels in love with one of his pupils, a young Countess Esterh√°zy [...]. In addition to his lessons there, he also visited the Count's home, from time to time, under the aegis of his patron, the singer Vogl. [...] On such occasions Schubert was quite content to take a back seat, to remain quietly by the side of his adored pupil, and to thrust love's arrow ever deeper into his heart. [...] Countess Caroline may be looked upon as his visible, beneficent muse, as the Leonore of this musical Tasso.\\" According to Sch√∂nstein, ‚Äúwhen [the countess] once jokingly teased Schubert that he had never dedicated a piece of his to her he responded: 'Why do that? Everything is dedicated to you anyway.'‚Äù Shortly before his death, Schubert nonetheless dedicated his Fantasia in F minor to her.  In popular culture  \\"Schubertiade at Josef von Spaun\\", by Moritz von Schwind. A portrait of Caroline Esterh√°zy can be seen hanging over the piano. Moritz von Schwind, in his drawing \\"Schubertiade at Josef von Spaun\\", shows a portrait of Caroline Esterh√°zy hanging over the piano which Schubert is playing. A number of films have fictionalized Esterh√°zy‚Äôs relationship with Schubert, including Gently My Songs Entreat (1933), Unfinished Symphony (1934) and Symphony of Love (1954). The countess is also a main character in the French novella Un √©t√© √† quatre mains.

Background In February 1644 the Royalist commander Prince Rupert moved to Wales to take up his new post of President of Wales. In May of the year, however, he marched with his available forces to Lancashire, leaving Oswestry garrisoned by a small force under the command of Colonel Edward Lloyd. At that time, the Royalists of the Oswestry garrison were responsible for the control of Wales and the Marshes. With the absence of Prince Rupert, the local Parliamentarians led by Lord Denbigh and Colonel Mytton decided in June 1644 to take control of the walled town and castle. The battle The attack began at 14:00 hours on 22 June as the Parliamentarians had learned from spies that the garrison at that time wasn't fully defended as the Governor had taken some Parliamentary prisoners to Shrewsbury. The Parliamentarian cavalry was deployed in the rear to guard against relief attempts while 200 foot moved up to attack the town. In their initial attack, the Parliamentarians first captured the defended St Oswalds church which stood outside the town walls and then demolished the main gate of the town with cannonfire. The Royalist defenders withdrew to the castle and the Parliamentarians occupied the town. The following morning the Royalist garrison was persuaded to surrender. Lord Denbigh then set off in pursuit of Prince Rupert, leaving Colonel Mytton to garrison the town. Aftermath In view of the fact that the loss of Oswestry severed communications between Chester and Shrewsbury, Sir Fulke Huncke, the Royalist commander in Shrewsbury, felt obliged to recover the town and set off on a relief mission with 2000 infantry and 600 cavalry. Lord Denbigh, who had by now reached Cheshire, sent back Sir Thomas Myddelton with a force of cavalry to support the Parliamentarian defenders. Colonel Marrow led out the Royalist cavalry to intercept Myddelton's force, but was routed on 2 July by the Parliamentary cavalry at Whittington, some three miles from Oswestry. Faced by the loss of his cavalry, Huncke was forced to return to Shrewsbury. Oswestry Castle was later destroyed by the Parliamentarians.

Historical eruptions During recorded history, eruptions at Mount Baker have mainly occurred from Sherman Crater. The earliest historical eruption took place in 1843, with more recent eruptions having occurred in 1852‚Äì1853, 1854, 1858, 1859‚Äì1860, 1863, 1870 and 1880. These eruptions ranked 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. Possible but unconfirmed eruptions may have also occurred in 1850, 1856, 1860, 1865, 1867, 1869 and 1884. 1975 activity In March 1975, local observers noted a dark column rising from Sherman Crater that sharply contrasted with previous white steam emissions. Over the next year several ashy plumes resulted in the formation of several small near-vent lahars. In addition scientists measured a ten-fold increase in thermal activity and detected magmatic gases, increasing concern that an eruption could occur. This was the first hint of volcanic activity in the Cascade Range since the 1914‚Äì1917 eruption of Lassen Peak in northern California. By the fall of 1975, melting of Sherman Crater glacier resulted in a snow-free area three times larger than typical summer exposure and revealed a shallow crater lake and previously unknown fumaroles. Sampling fumarole gas at Sherman Crater in 1981 A major concern was that an eruption might cause the walls of Sherman Crater to collapse, sending lahars into Baker Lake reservoir and cause a wave to overtop, or significantly damage, the Upper Baker Dam. Either event would result in a large volume of water rushing into the Lake Shannon reservoir and potentially cause a surge of water over, or failure of, the Lower Baker Dam. Failure of the Lower Baker Dam would result in catastrophic flooding down the Skagit River with little to no warning. This was an especially worrying scenario for the town of Concrete, which lies at the foot of the Lower Baker Dam. As a result of the activity and hazard concerns, all potential monitoring tools available at the time were employed and the Baker Lake reservoir was lowered to accommodate possible lahars. This was the first extensive and modern monitoring campaign at a Cascade volcano. Monitoring techniques included installation of a seismic network, tilt monitoring, temperature measurements, fumarole and airborne gas sampling, crater meltwater analysis and gravity measurements. As time passed, no clear signs of rising magma, significant changes in gas composition or emission rates or surface deformation appeared. The activity gradually declined over the following two years but the amount of heat escaping from the ground stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. Field observations and onsite monitoring occurred sporadically in the 1990s and more regularly in the 2000s, which provided for a relatively long-term data set regarding the behavior of Mount Baker. The data collected suggests that magma may have intruded beneath the volcano in 1975, but it did not have enough energy to erupt. The magma stalled, likely in the form of a dike, and has been cooling since. The shallow magma heated the overlying hydrothermal system, which caused the observed increases in heat and gas emissions as well as providing energy for the steam explosions.

Ansfield co-founded the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 1964, along with Harry Bisel, Arnoldus Goudsmit, Herman H. Freckman, Robert W. Talley, William Wilson and Jane Cooke Wright. He served as ASCO's third president (1966-1967). Dr. Fred J Ansfield > \\"He shall be remembered by cancer treatment specialists everywhere as one of > the founders of Medical Oncology.\\"  Early life  Ansfield was born on August 30, 1910, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By age 13, both of his parents had died from cancer, steering him towards medicine and cancer research. He attended the University of Wisconsin, receiving his Bachelor's degree in 1931. During this period he first had the idea to use mice to find a cure for mammary cancer in animals. Ansfield received his M.D. in 1933 from the University of Wisconsin Medical School. After his internship and residency training at Milwaukee County Hospital, Ansfield became a camp physician for the Civilian Conservation Corps near Glidden, Wisconsin. He entered private practice there in 1936, with the goal of saving enough money to fund his mouse experiments. During World War II, Ansfield served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps as a battalion surgeon for the 11th Airborne division in the Philippines and New Guinea. He earned the Bronze Star, Silver Star and Purple Heart. After the war, he returned to practice in Glidden, Wisconsin. In 1952 Ansfield began discussing the idea of using the immune system in cancer therapy with his former medical school classmate, Dr. Harold Rusch, then head of the McArdle Memorial Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Rusch helped Dr. Ansfield get started with mouse surgery experiments by providing lab space and equipment. Drs. Ansfield and Rusch designed and began a series of immunotherapy experiments for testing tumors in mice. In 1957, Dr. Ansfield joined the University of Wisconsin's faculty in an instructor position in the clinical oncology division of the Department of Surgery. His first faculty assignment was testing 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil), a new drug conceptualized and developed by Professor Charles Heidelberger of the McArdle Laboratory. \\"It was just after he arrived here [Madison] that Dr. Ansfield proposed that dosages of a new drug, 5-Fluorouracil, be increased in the treatment of incurable cancer to find if it had more value than was generally believed\\". > \\"Dr. Ansfield found that 5-FU was effective against advanced colon cancer, a > disease that defied other treatments.

The asylum was designed to cater for 200 patients, although in anticipation of future extension the administrative portion of the building was adapted for a larger number. It was erected on a commanding site in the parish of Ugborough, on the borders of Dartmoor. Stone for the building was quarried on the estate, and the masonry dressings are of limestone, brick, Portland and Bath stone. The chapel is in the Early English style. The contracted price for the asylum was ¬£34,514; Pethick Brothers, of Plymouth acted as contractors. The Mayor, Alderman Waring, Chairman of the Plymouth Justices, laid the foundation stone in 1888. The hospital was opened as the Plymouth Borough Asylum in October 1891. Plymouth Asylum floor plan in 1890 Situated at above sea level, its patients enjoyed excellent views down to the sea below.

Early life and education  Jorge Haddock Acevedo was born to his father of the same name and Francisca Acevedo, in Caguas, Puerto Rico on 15 August 1955. Haddock has two siblings, one of which is the actress . His mother, who held a master's degree, later divorced and raised her three children as a single mother with help of her father, Pedro \\"Don Peyo\\" Acevedo. Haddock's maternal grandfather, to whom Haddock later dedicated his doctoral thesis, was a waiter who had been able to send Francisca and her two brothers to college, one of whom became an accountant and the other an engineer. In 2019 Haddock was a guest to one of Gilda's daughter's wedding. On 7 June 1980 he married Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Valent√≠n D√≠az. They have two children, Angelique and Alexander, and four grandchildren: Desmond, Cameron, Lily and Noah. Haddock earned a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez in May 1978 There he received a full-ride scholarship, without which, Haddock claimed, he would not have been able to attend. The following May he obtained a master's degree in Management Engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, followed by a PhD in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in 1981 while simultaneously being an industrial engineering assistant professor in his baccalaureate alma mater. Early career He is a co-inventor of patent WO1997003409A1 filed under the title \\"Method and system for providing credit support to parties associated with derivative and other financial transactions.\\" Additionally, he has authored over a hundred publications. Between 1985-86 Haddock was the advisor to the student chapter of the Institute of Industrial Engineers at Clemson University. In 1999 he became a professor at the Lally School of Management and Technology, and later, in 2004, its dean. The next year Haddock was named dean of the Robins School of Business, of the University of Richmond, by then president William Cooper. He is the author of the book Creating Global Business Leaders: Business Education at the Intersection of Innovation, Technology, and Globalization. In 2009 he was appointed as dean of the then George Mason University School of Management. During his tenure there Haddock was invited to speak to the Rotary Club of Tysons Corner, and was named to the Association to Advance Collegiate School of Business, where he was part of the Initial Accreditation Committee between 2011‚Äì2014. When he became President of the University of Puerto Rico, he was invited to the aforementioned body's annual conference as a speaker on alternative revenue streams. Haddock was also appointed as mentor to the University of Bahrain's College of Business. Additionally, he was named chair of the Advisory Board to the Greater Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 2011. In 2013 he aspired to two presidential positions. Haddock was one of five finalists for the position of University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Chancellor. Additionally, he was one of two finalist nominees for president of Fairleigh Dickinson University. In early 2014 Haddock was one of five nominees aspiring to the deanship of Daniels College of Business. Later that year he was named dean of the University of Massachusetts Boston's School of Management, where he also led its Entrepreneur Center as interim director and was chairperson to the Affirmative Action Advisory Committee.  President of the University of Puerto Rico  Selection In 2018 he was selected by the Board of Governors of the University of Puerto Rico to be Chancellor. His appointment, however, was not effective until 4 September, when he would be in Puerto Rico. When asked about his appointment, Haddock claimed that he would work \\"25 hours [a day], 8 days [a week].\\" His annual salary of $240,000,caused much controversy since the wage ceiling has been $105,000 since 1997. Additionally he was provided with a stipend ceiling of $5,000 for relocalization purposes. In a press conference immediately after his appointment was announced, Haddock said \\"I have taken a substantial income hit. I do it because I did not come here for the money...\\" On 4 September 2018, he assumed the role of president, upon which he said the budget cuts proposed by the Financial Oversight Management Board (FOMB) were \\"manageable\\", thought they would reduce the state's contributions to the university budget of $1,347 million (2018) by $243 million by 2023. The University has two simultaneous fiscal plans, one approved by the Board of Governors and the other by the FOMB. Haddock has claimed that the FOMB does not micromanage the university. When he received notification that the FOMB would require an additional $80 million as contributions to the pension plan, Haddock told Inside Higher Ed \\"We don‚Äôt have the money on top of the $86 million cuts -- now they want us to add another $80 million contribution. It's almost like they want to hurt us.\\" Less than a month after taking office and having gone to each campus to better comprehend their problems, he had a meeting with the Executive Director of the FOMB, Natalie Jaresko, to \\"better explain to her the importance of full-ride scholarships, as well as the impact of the measures\\" expected by the FOMB. Since the FOMB had planned a yearly increase in cost-per-credit, Rock Solid Technologies doubled their 16 year old scholarship program to include four students in 2018, who had the opportunity to participate in a paid internship in the company. In the middle of the uncertainty of the time, Haddock recognized university achievements such as an Emmy-nominated documentary about Hurricane Mar√≠a made by University of Puerto Rico Arecibo students. In April 2019 the UPR Board of Governors acceded to a request from the FOMB to increase the cost-per-credit from $115 to $124 by July. The former was an increase as well from a long held cost of $57. Haddock opposed the gradual increase proposed by the FOMB of $124 (2019-2020), $134 (2020-2021), $145 (2021-2022) ending with $157 by the 2022‚Äì2023 academic year as well as other cuts stipulated in their plan. Budget cuts Apart from the budget costs that the university faced, the matter of most importance to the university was the re- accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), which had most campuses under probation. This had occurred since several financial audits had not been done for the past several years. Additionally it risked the potential closing of the whole university by 2021, in what is known as a teach-out plan. These allegations arose from the release, apparently against MSCHE policy, of the R√≠o Piedras campus' show cause report, which included the teach-out plan. To silence these fears, Haddock assured that the university would remain open and submission of teach-out plans are a routine part of the reaccreditation process. To turn in all documents on time, he ordered that no employee could go on winter recess until these had been satisfactorily submitted. In January 2019 he accused one of the largest unions for non-faculty staff, the Brotherhood of Exent Non-Faculty Employees (HEEND, in Spanish) for the delay of the 2018 financial statements. The HEEND claimed that those documents were the responsibility of Ernst & Young, as they were the external auditors. On three occasions the HEEND held protests blocking the entrance of non-faculty employees who worked on these statements to the university's central administration. On a fourth occasion, on 20 February, which Haddock called \\"irresponsible\\" and accused the HEEND of putting the accreditation at risk, employees were not able to access their workplace by car, but were permitted to do so as pedestrians. As such, Haddock docked the wages of employees who did not go to work. The university had to comply by submitting the 2017 documents by 15 January 2019 and the 2018 financial statements by March,though the latter was then extended until 30 April, however brought up a week earlier to the 21, as well as a report to the MSCHE by 25 January as to why accreditation should be granted to the university's eleven campuses. The university was able to turn in the 2016-2017 financial statements the night of 14 January, which was still 12 days after the deadline. In an interview upon announcing the completion and submission of the 2017 financial statements, Haddock claimed that the university had been late to turn documents of the same nature for the past eleven years. The Puerto Rican Association of University Professors (APPU, in Spanish) claimed that the loss of accreditation would have a domino effect on the educational system of Puerto Rico and that the university administration was \\"playing Russian roulette\\" with the issue of accreditation. The 2017-2018 financial statements were finally submitted on 29 April. At first glance, these revealed that the universe had $300 million in expenses over revenue. However, it turned out this was money owed to the retirement fund. The actuarial debt, the total amount it would take for the fund to pay all its responsibilities, amounted to $2,900 million for 2018, up from $2,010 million the year before. As such, Haddock assured that measures were taken so all required documents were turned in on time in posterity. On 6 June 2019, the FOMB released a new cuts upon those already implemented. The already executed cuts, Haddock claimed, showed that the UPR could survive \\"without laying off employees or closing campuses.\\" The FOMB proposed \\"to freeze the defined benefit plan immediately and, to avoid its insolvency, that the UPR withdraw $160 million instead of the $80 million\\" that was originally projected. Haddock claimed this was \\"risky\\" since \\"it would leave the UPR without a rainy day fund. Financial aid reforms Haddock announced that a new financial aid model would be rolled out for the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year on 13 February 2019. The FOMB had ordered that all full-ride scholarships be eliminated, except for high academic achievers and veterans. In the 2018-2019 Academic year, the full-ride scholarships were reduced by 50%. The new model would not give out scholarships based on merit, but on economic necessities. However, it would keep the same requirements for except for the spouses of university employees. Haddock stated his support to then governor Ricardo Rosell√≥ Nevares' announcement in a state of the state address on 24 April 2019 in which Rosell√≥ proposed a free higher education model. He made it known that this would be through a massive open online course (MOOC), which had been already used by most private universities on Puerto Rico for online or degree courses online. This came just as it was revealed that less graduate students were admitted for the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year, being 495 admitted of the 3,049 who applied compared to the previous year's 1,139 of 3,568. This worried Haddock, however, it was more than the projected 3.3% reduction overall for total number of students in the university, which would be 53,203. Haddock was successful in making an agreement with the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration (PRFAA), where the university would have a representative in the agency. The representative would have to be an expert in federal grants and search for federal funding for the university. This position, as well as a $1 million in additional contracts and the buying of three new robes for the Board of Governors, received much criticism from the HEEND. Haddock stated that it was \\"incredible that the resource contracts that worked in the process for the University to meet the requirements of federal agencies and that helped us achieve the extension of accreditation\\" would be deemed \\"unnecessary,\\" and that resistance to initiatives that would increase revenue and make university bureaucracy more efficient was \\"absurd.\\" As to the acquisition of robes, Haddock clarified that this was necessary for the members to participate in graduations and official ceremonies as required by university protocol and policy. It was under Haddock's administration, in March 2019, six months after he took office and eighteen since Hurricane Mar√≠a, that the university received the first round of funds to repair campus' facilities damaged by the hurricane. That same month, he initiated the search for rectors in propriety, since these had been interim since 2016. These are nominated by committees in their respective campuses, then by the president and approved by the Board of Governors. Later, in May, the Board approved 9 of the 11 nominated rectors, since Haddock had retired the nominations from Cayey and Humacao. Haddock oversaw the closure of the university newspaper, Di√°logo, which after 32 years in print, was moved online and employees were laid off until only the editor and her assistant were left. They were reassigned, while the newspaper was moved from the central administration to the Arecibo campus. In May 2019, Haddock order a stop to the eviction of Nelson Sambol√≠n, a renowned artist who had his workshop at the university headquarters at the San Juan Botanical Garden. It was revealed that Sambol√≠n had a contract with the UPR between 2015 and 31 June 2017, when his contract expired. However, the UPR continued making payments of $1,500 a month, without a contract, amounting to $10,500 by the time this was announced. Haddock claimed he was \\"proud\\" of Sambolin's work. Nonetheless, he was presented an eviction letter that stated he had to vacate the premises in 10 days time. Investiture His investiture ceremony, which took place at 9:00 a.m. on 13 June 2019 at the R√≠o Piedras campus's theatre, was mired with controversy. The last presidential investiture to take place was for Ismael Almod√≥var, who was president between 1977‚Äì1985. Even though they sent more than 500 invitations to universities outside of Puerto Rico, less than ten actually sent representatives. One ticket per person was offered to all employees and students who presented their official IDs at their respective campuses. Most of the audience was composed of deans of the university, some representatives of universities from the United States and presidents of the Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico, the Antillean Adventist University and the Universidad del Sagrado Coraz√≥n. Before the event, outside the venue accompanied by a group of protestors, the president of the HEEND, requested that the total cost of the ceremony be revealed, since it had been marketed as a \\"simple\\" event by the university and had a cost of $3,525 in academic dresses alone. During the ceremony, Haddock was handed a mallet used by the inaugural president, Jaime Ben√≠tez, as well as a medal. As the latter was being placed around his neck, a protestor displayed a banner which described Haddock as \\"insolent\\". The afternoon after the ceremony had finished it was revealed that the total estimated cost was $5,500, which was compared to the $40,000 it costs per graduation. Haddock was criticized for allegedly \\"feeding his ego\\" and the ceremony as a whole was labelled as \\"shameful\\". In 2018 he inaugurated a Learning Commons Center at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. In 2019 he was named Honorary Co-Chair of the Honorary Committee of the University of Albany's RISE 2019 conference. He has propelled the entrepreneurial and investigative development of the aeronautics and areospacial industries in Puerto Rico. Possible closure of campuses In October 2019, Haddock announced the possible closure of some campuses of the University due to proposed budget costs by the FOMB for the following fiscal and academic year. Allegedly, in a letter sent to the President of the Board of Governors in January 2020, he attempted to detain payments to employees of four campuses which had remained closed for two days during the preceding Fall Semester because of student protests against the budget costs.

This is contrasted with global differential privacy, a model of differential privacy that incorporates a central aggregator with access to the raw data. History In 2003, Alexandre V. Evfimievski, Johannes Gehrke, Ramakrishnan Srikant gave a definition equivalent to local differential privacy. In 2008, Kasiviswanathan et al. gave a formal definition conforming with the standard definition of differential privacy. The prototypical example of a locally differential private mechanism is the randomized response survey technique proposed by Stanley L. Warner in 1965, predating modern discussions of privacy. Warner's innovation was the introduction of the ‚Äúuntrusted curator‚Äù model, where the entity collecting the data may not be trustworthy. Before users' responses are sent to the curator, the answers are randomized in a controlled manner guaranteeing differential privacy while allowing valid population-wide statistical inferences. Œµ-local differential privacy =Definition of Œµ-local differential privacy= Let Œµ be a positive real number and \\\\mathcal{A} be a randomized algorithm that takes a user's private data as input. Let \\\\textrm{im} \\\\mathcal{A} denote the image of \\\\mathcal{A}. The algorithm \\\\mathcal{A} is said to provide \\\\epsilon-local differential privacy if, for all pairs of user's possible private data x and x^\\\\prime and all subsets S of \\\\textrm{im} \\\\mathcal{A}: \\\\Pr[\\\\mathcal{A}(x) \\\\in S] \\\\leq e^{\\\\epsilon} \\\\times \\\\Pr[\\\\mathcal{A}(x^\\\\prime) \\\\in S], where the probability is taken over the randomness used by the algorithm. The main difference between this definition and the standard definition of differential privacy is that in differential privacy the probabilities are of the outputs of an algorithm that takes all users' data and here it is on an algorithm that takes a single user's data. Sometimes the definition takes an algorithm that has all users data as input, and outputs a collection of all responses (such as the definition in Raef Bassily, Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer and Abhradeep Guha Thakurta's 2017 paper ). Deployment Local differential privacy has been deployed in several internet companies: References Theory of cryptography Information privacy Differential privacy ","title":"Local differential privacy"},{"id":"60504494","text":"Differentially private analysis of graphs studies algorithms for computing accurate graph statistics while preserving differential privacy. Such algorithms are used for data represented in the form of a graph where nodes correspond to individuals and edges correspond to relationships between them. For examples, edges could correspond to friendships, sexual relationships, or communication patterns. A party that collected sensitive graph data can process it using a differentially private algorithm and publish the output of the algorithm. The goal differentially private analysis of graphs is to design algorithms that compute accurate global information about graphs while preserving privacy of individuals whose data is stored in the graph. Variants Differential privacy imposes a restriction on the algorithm. Intuitively, it requires that the algorithm has roughly the same output distribution on neighboring inputs. If the input is a graph, there are two natural notions of neighboring inputs, edge neighbors and node neighbors, which yield two natural variants of differential privacy for graph data. Let Œµ be a positive real number and \\\\mathcal{A} be a randomized algorithm that takes a graph as input and returns an output from a set \\\\mathcal{O}. The algorithm \\\\mathcal{A} is \\\\epsilon-differentially private if, for all neighboring graphs G_1 and G_2 and all subsets S of \\\\mathcal{O}, \\\\Pr[\\\\mathcal{A}(G_1) \\\\in S] \\\\leq e^{\\\\epsilon} \\\\times \\\\Pr[\\\\mathcal{A}(G_2) \\\\in S], where the probability is taken over the randomness used by the algorithm. =Edge differential privacy= Two graphs are edge neighbors if they differ in one edge. An algorithm is \\\\epsilon-edge-differentially private if, in the definition above, the notion of edge neighbors is used. Intuitively, an edge differentially private algorithm has similar output distributions on any pair of graphs that differ in one edge, thus protecting changes to graph edges. =Node differential privacy= Two graphs are node neighbors if one can be obtained from the other by deleting a node and its adjacent edges. An algorithm is \\\\epsilon-node-differentially private if, in the definition above, the notion of node neighbors is used. Intuitively, a node differentially private algorithm has similar output distributions on any pair of graphs that differ in one one nodes and edges adjacent to it, thus protecting information pertaining to each individual. Node differential privacy give a stronger privacy protection than edge differential privacy. Research history The first edge differentially private algorithm was designed by Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith. The distinction between edge and node differential privacy was first discussed by Hay, Miklau, and Jensen. However, it took several years before first node differentially private algorithms were published in Blocki et al., Kasiviswanathan et al., and Chen and Zhou. In all three papers, the algorithms are for releasing a single statistic, like a triangle count or counts of other subgraphs. Raskhodnikova and Smith gave the first node differentially private algorithm for releasing a vector, specifically, the degree count and the degree distribution.

It is known for its issues of Cajun and zydeco music. Lee Lavergne began to record musicians local to his home in Church Point, Louisiana after he was returned from army service in Korea. The label was formed in 1960 as a secondary endeavor to Lavergne's job as a grocery clerk. Lavergne deeply wanted to be in the music business, but didn't think he could make it as a performer or a disk jockey. He became a fan of local cajun and rhythm and blues musicians, and decided he wanted to produce and release records. Initially he was discouraged from entering the record business by those he first worked with, but Lavergne decided to begin even if prospects were poor. Lanor's first release was by Shirley Bergeron in May 1960, its entire run of 2000 copies sold and immediately established Lanor as a viable ongoing entity. He supervised his own recording sessions that took place at Crowley and New Orleans, gaining experience and better technical results as time passed. The first Lanor album was also by Shirley Bergeron, entitled \\"The Sounds Of Cajun Music\\". This first album was successful, but a second album by Bergeron had disappointing sales. While promoting Bergeron's discs, Lavergne became acquainted with individuals in the rock and rhythm and blues promotion, and he began recording those genres. The label's first true hit was 1962's \\"Life Problem\\" by Elton Anderson. Capitol Records picked up the record for national distribution, and signed with Lanor for further recordings, but the agreement lasted only a short while, and then Anderson unexpectedly quit altogether. Recordings by Charles Mann, who sold very well in Louisiana and Texas, and Billy Matte provided further profitability. Lanor moved into the blues field briefly, but found the climate for a purer form of blues in Louisiana to be difficult with sales rarely exceeding 100 copies, and exited that market by 1963. Lanor entered the southern soul field in the late 1960s, to disappointing results. Lavergne opened a retail music store in 1972, and in 1975 moved Lanor into a location that was previously a restaurant and bar., but the label was in hiatus for most of the 1970s. Lanor came back in 1980 when it released an album of new Charles Mann material named \\"She's Walking Towards Me\\". In 1982, as Lavergne experienced increasing studio costs he built his own small studio consisting of an inexpensive mixing board and a single reel-to-reel recording unit. The label focused primarily on 45rpm singles until the 1990s, at which time it began to issue albums in cassette and compact disc formats. Later the label was owned and operated by Bobby and Pat Murray, and relocated to Jennings, Louisiana The label has been highly sought-after by fans of Cajun and zydeco, who often travel to Louisiana seeking releases. The label has also issued material in the bluegrass and blues genres.

She serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Washington. She is interested in subduction zone science, and studies how earthquakes trigger each other and how faults can slip. Gomberg is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union. She was the first person to demonstrate how dynamic stress associated with seismic waves can trigger other earthquakes.  Early life and education  Gomberg studied geophysics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1979. She moved to California for her graduate studies, earning a PhD in 1989. Gomberg held postdoctoral fellowships at University of California, San Diego and University of Nevada, Reno. She was awarded a Gilbert Fellowship in 1993.  Research and career  Gomberg joined the United States Geological Survey in 1988. She completed visiting research projects in New Zealand and Italy. At the United States Geological Survey, Gomberg has worked in Colorado, Memphis, and Seattle. In Memphis Gomberg worked on intraplate earthquakes. When she moved to Seattle, which is on a subduction zones. She specialises in earthquake seismology for the Earthquake Hazards Program in the Pacific Northwest. She uses 1-hertz Global Positioning System to monitor seismic waves, as well as high frequency GPS to study ground-motion. Gomberg demonstrated that earthquake aftershock are triggered by dynamic stress. She showed that dynamic stresses do not permanently change the applied load, but trigger earthquakes by changing the mechanical state of a fault zone. Faults that have been weakened by dynamic stresses can fail during seismic activity and trigger further earthquakes. In 2001, Gomberg wrote about the impact of the internet on communicating disaster and coordinating emergency response. It is well known that fast fault slips can trigger earthquakes, but Gomberg identified that slow, aseismic fault motion can also cause earthquakes. Gomberg studies the geological action beneath subduction zones, including submarine landslides. Her work has identified that earthquakes may start as foreshocks with aseismic slip. Gomberg used state-of-the art characterisation methods to contribute to the first seismic hazard maps for Memphis, Tennessee, incorporating the effect of local geology, including soils. Gomberg is a member of the faculty at the University of Washington, and a member of the Southern California Earthquake Center.

In 2018 he was rated the second-best two-year-old in Japan as he was undefeated in three starts including the Grade 1 Hopeful Stakes on his final appearance of the season. On his three-year-old debut he added another Grade 1 success as he took the Satsuki Sho but was beaten when odds-on favourite for the Tokyo Yushun. Later in the year he won the Kobe Shimbun Hai and finished second in the Arima Kinen. Background Saturnalia is a dark bay or brown horse with a white star bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During his racing career he was owned by U Carrot Farm. The colt was sent into training with Katsuhiko Sumii. Saturnalia was from the second crop of foals sired by Lord Kanaloa, an outstanding sprinter-miler who was voted Japanese Horse of the Year in 2013. Saturnalia's dam Cesario was a top-class racemare won the Yushun Himba and the American Oaks and went on to produce the Japan Cup winner Epiphaneia and the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes winner Leontes. She was a fourth-generation descendant of the Epsom Oaks winner Pia. As a fourth-generation descendant of the Epsom Oaks winner Pia, Cesario was related to other major winners, including Chief Singer and Pleasantly Perfect. Racing career =2018: two- year-old season= Saturnalia began his racing career in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 10 June 2018 and won from Deep Diver and seven others. After a break of more than four months, the colt returned for the Listed Hagi Stakes over 1800 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 27 October and won again, beating Jamil Fuerte and six others. When Sumii was banned from training horses after a drunk driving conviction Saturnalia's conditioning was handled by Kazuya Nakatake. On 28 December, Saturnalia was stepped up in class to contest the Grade 1 Hopeful Stakes over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. Ridden by Mirco Demuro, he was made the 0.8/1 favourite ahead of twelve opponents including the Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes winner Nishino Daisy. After racing in second place behind the front-running Cosmo Calendula, Saturnalia produced a strong run in the straight, took the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a half lengths from Admire Justa, with third place going to Nishino Daisy. After the race Demuro said \\"I feel great. I knew I was riding the strongest two-year-old of the season. He really showed his strength though squeezing his way through the narrow opening. I am really looking forward to his three-year-old season\\". In the official ratings for Japanese two-year-olds Saturnalia was rated the second best juvenile of the year, one pond behind the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes winner Admire Mars. In January 2019 Saturnalia finished second to the Admire Mars in the polling for the Best Two- Year-Old Colt at the JRA Awards for 2018 receiving 123 votes against his rivals 153. =2019: three-year-old season= Saturnalia wins the 79th Satsuki Sho Saturnalia moved back to the stable of Katsuhiko Sumii for the 2019 season. For his first run of the season the colt contested the Grade 1 Satsuki Sho, the first leg of the Japanese Triple Crown over 2000 metres at Nakayama on 14 April. In the run-up to the race his assistant trainer Yasuyuki Tsujino said \\"Things have been fine with him, his breathing's good, and he's run well in training with control and power... He's come along very well, and I don‚Äôt think he's been fully extended.\\" Ridden for the first time by Christophe Lemaire he was made the 0.7/1 favourite ahead of Admire Mars in an eighteen- runner field which included Velox, Danon Kingly (Tokinominoru Kinen), Fantasist (Keio Hai Nisai Stakes) and Meisho Tengen (Yayoi Sho). After racing in mid-division in the early stages, Saturnalia moved forward on the final turn and made a strong challenge in the straight taking the lead from Velox 200 metres from the finish. Velox rallied, while Danon Kingly produced a strong run up the inside rail but Saturnalia prevailed by a head and a nose. After the race Lemaire said \\"I rode him for the first time in the race but I had confidence in him. He seemed a bit nervous and drifted towards the inside when we took command before the crowd. His condition was not 100% as it was his first start this year but he should be in top condition going into the Japanese Derby.\\" On 26 May Saturnalia started the 0.6/1 favourite against seventeen opponents for the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres and was ridden by Damian Lane. After racing in eleventh place for most of the way he made rapid progress in the straight but never looked likely to catch the leaders and came home fourth behind Roger Barows, Danon Kingly and Velox, beaten three and a quarter lengths by the winner. After an absence of almost four months Saturnalia returned in the Kobe Shinbun Hai over 2400 metres at Hanshin on 22 September and started the odds-on favourite in an eight-runner field. Lemaire settled the colt in second place behind the front-running Sifflement before taking the lead in the straight. Saturnalia drew away in the closing tagess to win by three lengths from Velox with a further length and a quarter back to World Premiere in third place. Lemaire commented \\"He showed his strength today. He needed a horse in front of him and he relaxed in the back straight. His start was no good in the Derby but it was good today. Looking forward to the future, I'm sure he's a super horse\\". On 27 October Saturnalia faced older for the first time in the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo and started the 2.4/1 second favourite in a sixteen-runner field. He raced in third place for most of the way before fading in the straight and coming home sixth behind Almond Eye. For his final run of the year Saturnalia was matched against older horses again in the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 22 December. He raced towards the rear of the field before staying on strongly in the straight to take second place behind the five-year-old mare Lys Gracieux. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Saturnalia was voted Best Three-Year-Old Colt, beating Admire Mars by 124 votes to 107.

It was built in 1901, is still used and is one of the eight ‚ÄúFirst Category‚Äù bullrings in the country. In 1937 the bullring was named after Jos√© Pereira Palha Blanco, a cattle raiser, who organised a group of benefactors to form a joint-stock company to fund the building. Prior to its construction there had been three other bullrings on the same site, all constructed out of wood. The first was unsuitable because it lacked the traditional round shape, the second proved inadequate, and the third burned down. The inaugural bullfights in the new ring were held on September 30, 1901 and the bullring achieved prominence in 1905 when King Carlos attended. In addition to bullfighting the ring has hosted performances by artists such as the Portuguese fado singer Am√°lia Rodrigues. It has also been used for boxing events, carnival parades, contests between bands and as an open-air cinema, as well as for charitable events. During the rule of the totalitarian Estado Novo it was used for parades by the Mocidade Portuguesa, a right-wing youth organisation. During World War II it was used by cavalry mobilised for the war. Bullfighters to fight at the ring have included Domingo Ortega, Conchita Cintr√≥n and Carlos Arruza, as well as √Ålvaro Domecq y D√≠ez who is credited with reviving bullfighting on horseback.

Nominally a vassal to the Latin Emperor, the Podest√† functioned as a ruler in his own right, and answered to the Doge of Venice. The podest√† was also officially known as Governor of One-Fourth and One-Half of the Empire of Romania and was entitled to wearing the crimson buskins as the emperors.Hazlitt, William Carew. The Venetian Republic: Its Rise, Its Growth, and Its Fall 421‚Äì1797. Vol. 1, A. And C. Black, 1900. History =Background= The Venetians had enjoyed their own quarter in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople since the 1082 chrysobull of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. How that colony colony was governed is unknown; most likely it elected its own local elders, but occasionally consuls sent from Venice, or passing captains of the Venetian fleet, may have assumed some political responsibility. The Venetian position in Constantinople was immensely strengthened as a result of the Fourth Crusade, in which the Venetian fleet, and the Doge Enrico Dandolo, played a critical role. In the aftermath of the Sack of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire, he secured for Venice terms that made it paramount in the new state: the Republic claimed three eighths of the former Byzantine possessions, ensured recognition of the privileges the Republic had enjoyed under the Byzantine emperors, secured a dominant voice in the election of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, and pushed through its own candidate, Baldwin of Flanders, as the first Latin Emperor. Dandolo himself remained in Constantinople and received the exalted Byzantine title of Despot. Until his death on 29 May 1205, in the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Adrianople, he remained the ruler of the local Venetians, and one of the most important statesmen of the Latin Empire. =Establishment of the office= The Latin Empire with its vassals (in yellow) and the Greek successor states of the Byzantine Empire (in red) and Venetian possessions (in green), After Dandolo's death, the Venetians of Constantinople elected Marino Zeno as \\"By the Grace of God Podest√† and lord of one quarter and one half [quarter] of the whole Empire of Romania\\" in the Doge's stead. The use of such lofty titles was also a stake for influence given the existing power vacuum in the Latin Empire following Adrianople. Already in the first act of the new official, dated 29 June 1205, he appears with his own privy council, with a composition similar to the council of the Doge in Venice: judges (judices communi), councillors (consciliatores), a treasurer (camerarius), and a prosecutorial magistrate (avocatorio). According to the 16th-century historian Daniele Barbaro, for a while after Dandolo's death it was seriously considered to move the capital of the Republic from Venice to Constantinople. Although in all probability a later invention, it is an indication of the size and eminence of the Venetiam community in Constantinople become at this time, as well as the dominant role the Venetian played in the affairs of the Latin Empire. When Pietro Ziani was elected Doge in Venice to succeed Dandolo, on the one hand he (reluctantly) recognized the fait accompli of Zeno's election and confirmed him in his office, but also moved quickly \\"to redress the balance\\" between the mother city and its colony in Constantinople. In the first of these actions, October 1205, Zeno ceded Durazzo, Vagenetia, and Corfu, territories belonging to the Venetian share of the Empire of Romania and strategically located at the exit of the Adriatic, directly to Venice, although in reality the area was held by the Greek ruler of Epirus, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, whom the Venetians recognized in these possessions in 1210 as a Venetian vassal. At about the same time, Ziani issued a decree allowing any Venetian or allied citizen to privately occupy and govern any formerly Byzantine territory, with the right to pass this possession on to his descendants. This decree effectively bypassed the Podest√† as the nominal head of the Venetians in the Latin Empire: men like the Venetian Marco Sanudo, who founded the Duchy of Naxos, were thus subordinated directly to the Latin Emperor. After 1207, the title \\"Lord of one fourth and one half of the Empire of Romania\\" (dominator quartae partis et dimidiae Imperii Romaniae) was applied to the Doge rather than the Podest√†, who became simply \\"the Podest√† of the Venetians in Constantinople\\" (in Constantinopoli Venetorum Potestas). The Doges retained that title until the 1358 Treaty of Zara, and although some of the Podest√†s used it, it was only in their capacity as the Doge's representative. =Position within the Latin Empire= Based on an agreement concluded in October 1205, the Podest√† and his councillors (consiliarii) formed part of the executive council (consilium) of the Latin Empire, which was responsible for defence and foreign policy matters, as well as adjudicating disputes between the Emperor and his feudal lieges, alongside the Emperor and the \\"Frankish magnates\\" (magnates Francigenarum). However, the Venetian position was ambiguous: as Filip Van Tricht explains, Venice was \\"at one and the same time an independent state and a feudal partner in the empire\\". Thus the Podest√† conducted his own negotiations and concluded trade agreements with neighbouring rulers, although this independence did not extend to other areas of foreign policy, and the commercial agreements appear to have been largely aligned with the Latin Empire's policy at the time. The tension between Venice and the Emperor is evident in the frequent attempts by the emperors and powerful barons of the Latin Empire to intrude in nominally Venetian jurisdictions, and restrict and even revert Venetian claims and rights deriving from the Empire's foundational treaties of 1204‚Äì1205. This tendency arose very quickly: already by 1208, the executive council stipulated in 1205 had ceased to play its intended role, and the Emperor ceased involving the Podest√† or the Venetians in his decisions. This development was aided on the one hand by the stabilization of the Empire's military situation after its catastrophic early years, and by the relative weakness of the Podest√† and his councillors, given their brief and circumscribed tenures, vis-a-vis the Emperor and his barons. =Abolition and aftermath= In 1261, when Constantinople was retaken by the Byzantines under Michael VIII Palaiologos, the office of Podest√† ceased to exist and the Venetians were expelled from the city. In the Treaty of 1265/68 with Palaiologos, under which the Venetians were allowed to return, and the subsequent treaties, the Venetian colony in the city was now headed by an official known as the Bailo (baiulus or rector).

Function  This transmembrane protein is responsible for the influx of zinc, manganese, iron, and cadmium. ZIP8 is distributed among the embryo, placenta, and yolk sac during development. Within the embryo, the concentration of ZIP8 is highest during the developmental period of different organ systems, specifically the heart where is it localized in the endothelial cells. Cardiac development is a zinc- dependent event. Beginning around mouse E8.0, the heart is in a tubular form with an outer myocardium layer and an inner endocardium layer, separated by cardiac jelly. As development continues, trabeculation, the protrusion of cardiomyocytes into the cardiac jelly, begins and facilitates nutrient and oxygen exchange prior to the establishment of coronary vessels. Simultaneous with coronary circulation development, the trabeculae then collapse into the ventricular wall in a process known as compaction. Cardiomyocyte differentiation, proliferation, and trabeculae patterning is regulated through Notch 1 signaling, which is upregulated by the ECM. ADAMTS 1, 5, 7, 15, and 19 are zinc metalloenzymes responsible for degrading the ECM prior to compaction. Many studies have analyzed the effects of Slc39a8-/- on fetal heart development and have shown a decrease in zinc influx leading to an increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation through BMP10, hypertrabeculation through the upregulation of Notch1, and ventricular non-compaction due to the persistence of the ECM.

Little is known about the language, but it shared a much simplified grammatical system, with many features similar to the better attested Delaware Jargon spoken in the nearby Hudson and Delaware watersheds.Campbell, L. (p. 20). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.Goddard, I. (2000). 'The Use of Pidgins and Jargons on the East Coast of North America' in The Language Encounter in the Americas, 1492-1800: A Collection of Essays Gray, E. G. and Fiering, N. (eds). (pp. 74-75). New York, NY: Bergahn Books. It was mutually intelligible with the other Southern New England Algonquian languages. History =Development= Massachusett Pidgin is recorded as early as 1624, when references to it appear in the colonial records. With exception of Mobilian Jargon, most of the auxiliary languages that developed in North America are thought to have been brought about by contact with Europeans. There are several factors in place that make it very likely that the language pre-dated European arrival. The Massachusett people were once a numerically dominant people of the region, with a large population supported by the fertile lands of the coastal plain and ample access to riparian and ocean food resources. With a strong population, the Massachusett sachems were head of a loose alliance of peoples, covering all the Massachusett-speaking peoples, the Nipmuc and even the unclassified peoples of the Pioneer Valley before their numbers were felled by the leptospirosis outbreak circa 1619 and subsequent virgin soil epidemics and the large numbers of English colonists that usurped their land and competed with them for resources.Bragdon, K. J. (2005). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. (pp. 133-135). New York, NY: Columbia University Press. Massachusett was spoken by several peoples, including not only the Massachusett, but also the Pawtucket, Wampanoag, Nauset and Coweset peoples. It was mutually intelligible with the other Southern New England Algonquian languages (SNEA), spoken in southern New England and parts of Long Island, and related to but not mutually intelligible with the Abenakian languages spoken to the north and the Delawaran languages to the west and southwest of the SNEA region.Goddard, Ives. 1996. \\"Introduction.\\" Ives Goddard, ed., The Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17. Languages, pp. 1‚Äì16. Massachusett Pidgin and Massachusett Pidgin English are of interest to scholars of the English language and language contact, as most of the Algonquian loan words adopted from the peoples of New England were adopted through these languages and not directly from Massachusett.Rice, K. (2012). 'English in Contact: Native American Languages' in (A. Bergs & L. J. Brinton, Eds.) English Historical Linguistics: An International Handbook., II, pp. 1753‚Äì1767. =Colonial attestation= The existence of Massachusett Pidgin is only inferred from colonial sources. Edward Winslow, who served as governor of the Plymouth Colony, had developed a close relationship with the Wampanoag sachem Massasoit and other local Wampanoag leaders and was one of a handful of the Pilgrims that had any command of the local 'Indian language.' In Winslow's 1624 publication Good News from New England, he describes a situation where his party of Pilgrim men came across some Wampanoag men they knew and were able to communicate, but when the Wampanoag spoke to each other, it was incomprehensible.Goddard, I. (2000). pp. 33-34. Winslow later on recalls the visit of the Massachusett sachem Chickatawbut. After exchanging pleasantries with the Winslow and the other representatives of the Plymouth Colony, the conversation between the sachems was not understood by Winslow save a few words. Similar accounts are recorded by the Dutch and Swedish colonists of what is now the Mid-Atlantic States and the traditional homeland of the Lenape peoples. Like Winslow, the Dutch and Swedish settlers thought they were speaking the local language, but were actually speaking pidgin varieties thereof. Massachusett Pidgin spread with the fur trade, allowing Indians to communicate with northern and interior tribes and exchange items for beaver pelts, which were highly prized by the English settlers. As beaver became scarce in southern New England, the Indian traders and hunters had to trek further to obtain the desired pelts, likely taking the easy to learn and somewhat intelligible Massachusett Pidgin. As the English settlers were not interested in learning the local language, and the Indians, outnumbered by English settlers, needed English to trade and participate in wider society, switched over to Massachusett Pidgin English, essentially Massachusett Pidgin with heavy English relexification. The Native peoples of New England continued to use their local dialect or language such as Massachusett, Massachusett Pidgin and Massachusett Pidgin English to communicate. Dual use of these by the Native peoples is recorded as early as 1651 in Connecticut, where trade was conducted on English vessels with Indian interpreters possibly code- switching between Massachusett Pidgin and Massachusett Pidgin. Similarly, a court trial involving an Indian accused of stealing a hog was shown a hog's head and told tatapa you (t√¢tapaw y8) , 'similar to this,' and in Massachusett Pidgin 'all one this' in Massachusett Pidgin English in 1704. =Decline= The Massachusett speaking peoples also adopted English, albeit imperfectly with heavy influences of Massachusett grammar and some vocabulary. The use of the Massachusett language declined in Massachusett communities in the 1750s and the 1770s in the Wampanoag communities as Massachusett Pidgin English, and later English, began to overtake the Native languages. This was part due to assimilation pressures, increased rates of intermarriage with Blacks and Whites outside the speech community and This co-existed with the usage of Massachusett Pidgin, but as English became more and more necessary to trade and participate in society, and the new settlers were less eager to bother to learn the 'Indian language,' Massachusett Pidgin was rapidly eclipsed by the sole use of Massachusett Pidgin English.Bragdon, K. J. (1981). 'Linguistic acculturation in Massachusett: 1663-1771' in Papers of the 12th Algonquian Conference. Cowan, W. (ed.) Ottawa, ON: Carleton University. Massachusett Pidgin may have influenced the late-stage of the Massachusett language, and many of the small number of words recorded by Speck when he visited the elderly members of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe in the 1920s, many were actually Massachusett Pidgin derivations. The Massachusett language went extinct at the end of the nineteenth century, with the death of the last native speakers of Aquinnah, but the language had already declined as the primary language of the Indian communities in the 1770s. Lexicon =Massachusett= Most of the vocabulary is drawn from the Massachusett language, although Massachusett Pidgin does feature some shortened expressions and word compounds that would not be permissible in the normal spoken language. As the majority of the lexicon is derived from Massachusett, it is assumed that speakers, especially the Natives themselves, pronounced the words according to the rules of Massachusett phonology. * neenGoodard, I.

Mohegan Tribe. =English= As Massachusett Pidgin was often used to communicate with the English settlers, it naturally incorporated numerous English terms. Hundreds of words were adopted into Massachusett from English, mainly for the new crops, domesticated animals, tools, material culture and religion of the English settlers. Many items of the English quickly became prized items of trade. Although it is uncertain to what extant these words were used in Massachusett Pidgin, the words listed below were known to have been absorbed into the Massachusett language. Due to the reduced phonemic inventory of Massachusett, most words were approximated to their closest Massachusett equivalent sounds. English and were often replaced by due to interference from N-SNEA dialect pronunciation, as Massachusett speakers were familiar with neighboring languages where cognate words with /r/ and /l/ became /n/ in Massachusett. As consonant clusters were limited, an epenthetic vowel was often inserted to ease pronunciation. English words were also overtly marked with the Massachusett declensional pronoun and verb conjugation system, producing hybrid forms. * pigsack, 'pigs,' from English 'pigs' (pl) and Massachusett animate plural () . Possibly pronounced * or *. * coneekoRees-Miller, J. (1996). Morphological Adaptation of English Loanwords in Algonquian.

Possibly pronounced *. * Frenchmensog, 'Frenchmen,' from hypercorrected plural of English 'Frenchmen' and Massachusett animate plural. Possibly pronounced as *, from variant spelling panachmansog. Grammatical features Like Pidgin Delaware, verbs in Massachusett are simplified into the inanimate forms. For example, Massasoit is believed to have said to Winslow upon his deathbed, (), 'Oh Winslow, I shall never see thee again' but more literally 'Not I again see Winslow.' In standard Massachusett, the expected verb would be ()Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 51. , a transitive animate verb, 'I see (someone)' or more direct () , 'I see you,' as opposed to ()Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 48. , the transitive inanimate 'see it.' The simplification of all the verbs to inanimate forms necessitated the need of pronouns to clarify meaning as opposed to the standard Algonquian languages which are pro-drop due to the pronominal information encoded in the verb declension.

Attacks on Implementations  In addition to standard defects of software artifacts that can be identified using testing or fuzzing, implementations of differentially private mechanisms may suffer from the following vulnerabilities: * Subtle algorithmic or analytical mistakes. * Timing side-channel attacks. In contrast with timing attacks against implementations of cryptographic algorithms that typically have low leakage rate and must be followed with non-trivial cryptanalysis, a timing channel may lead to a catastrophic compromise of a differentially private system, since a targeted attack can be used to exfiltrate the very bit that the system is designed to hide. * Leakage through floating-point arithmetic. Differentially private algorithms are typically presented in the language of probability distributions, which most naturally lead to implementations using floating- point arithmetic. The abstraction of floating-point arithmetic is leaky, and without careful attention to details, a naive implementation may fail to provide differential privacy. (This is particularly the case for Œµ-differential privacy, which does not allow any probability of failure, even in the worst case.) For example, the support of a textbook sampler of the Laplace distribution (required, for instance, for the Laplace mechanism) is less than 80% of all double-precision floating point numbers; moreover, the support for distributions with different means are not identical. A single sample from a na√Øve implementation of the Laplace mechanism allows distinguishing between two adjacent datasets with probability more than 35%. * Timing channel through floating-point arithmetic. Unlike operations over integers that are typically constant-time on modern CPUs, floating-point arithmetic exhibits significant input-dependent timing variability. Handling of subnormals can be particularly slow, as much as by √ó100 compared to the typical case.

The Internal Troops of Turkmenistan (Turkmen: T√ºrkmenistany≈à i√ßeri i≈üler edaralaryny≈à i≈üg√§rlerine) is a service branch of the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan under the auspices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is one of three types of paramilitary forces in the country, with the other two being the Turkmen National Guard and the Turkmen Border Troops. It is designed to maintain law and order and enforce the status quo in terms of state sovereignty. It aides the Turkmen National Police in everyday activities, similarly to the Military Police Corps in the United States Army. In an operational view, the internal troops are organized similarly to the Turkmen Ground Forces, both consisting of sub-units. The Internal Troops consists of between 20,000 and 25,000 personnel. Tasks The main tasks of the Internal Troops since its establishment in January 1992 have been: *Protect the rights and freedoms of citizens and ensure their personal security *Enforce the law and keep public order *Suppress and/or eradicate criminal offenses caused by high-profile criminals *Investigate high-profie crimes *Ensure road safety and compliance with road laws Military Unit 1001 The Military Unit 1001 named after M√§likguly Berdimuhamedow is one of the more notable units of the Internal Troops.http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/articles/15876.html Located in Ashgabat, is named in honour of M√§likguly Berdimuhamedowi√ß Berdimuhamedow (renamed by order of Assembly Chairman Akja Nurberdi√Ωewa in 2012http://www.turkmeninform.com/ru/news/20120208/05285.html), a former Colonel of Police in a prison guard detachment–ò–º—è –æ—Ç—Ü–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –¢—É—Ä–∫–º–µ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ —É–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ—á–∏–ª–∏ –≤ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≤–æ–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ US embassy cables: Turkmenistan president 'not a very bright guy', Theguardian.com, 2 December 2010 and the father of the current President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.

Her husband was the polar explorer Edward Adrian Wilson. Early life Oriana Souper was born in Bradfield, Berkshire, in circa 1874 as the oldest child of Fanny Emmeline () and Francis Abraham Souper, a clergyman and headmaster of Bradfield College. The 1881 census listed her as six years old with three younger siblings, James F. T., Noel Beaumont, and Constance. At age twelve, her mother died, which left her to care for the household. Before her marriage, she worked as a matron at a prep school in Cheltenham. Naturalist work Reverend George Seaver described Wilson as \\"a good field naturalist and blest with a quick and lively observation\\", saying that she, like her husband, had a particular affinity for birds. Wilson collected the holotype for the Australasian bent- wing bat, for which Oldfield Thomas named the species Miniopterus orianae. In 1914, Leiper and Atkinson named a cestode genus after her, Oriana, with the type species of the genus as Oriana wilsoni. However, Oriana was recognised as a synonym of Tetrabothrius, so the species was renamed as T. wilsoni. Later life and death During the First World War, Wilson worked to provide comforts to New Zealand troops in Britain. She was awarded the Commander of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours in recognition of her \\"signal services\\". The award was given mainly in association with her work as honorary secretary of the Hospital Comforts Committee, which came under the New Zealand Red Cross. Wilson destroyed much of her personal correspondence, so details of her later life are few. However, she seemed to have travelled extensively through East Africa based on surviving correspondence to Apsley Cherry-Garrard. She also travelled to an area south of Port Darwin, Australia, that had been previously unvisited by Western women. She died in a nursing home in Finchley, London, England on 25 April 1945. Personal life In 1897, she met Edward Adrian Wilson, at Caius House, Battersea, while he was conducting mission work in London. They married on 16 July 1901, three weeks before Edward left on the Antarctic Discovery Expedition; the sledging flag she sewed for him was, after his death, displayed in Gloucester Cathedral and is now in the collection of the Scott Polar Research Institute. The wedding was in Hilton, Huntingdonshire, where her father was vicar. Wilson was widowed by her husband's death on the Terra Nova Expedition in March 1912. Fundraising efforts for families of those who died on the expedition were enormously successful, especially considering that only five men died. The Mansion House raised ¬£75,000 in 1912, . As a widow, Wilson's income included ¬£300 annually in a government pension (); ¬£8,500 as a one-time payment from the Mansion House trust (); and a ¬£636 salary from the British Antarctic Expedition (). The loss of her husband was a blow to her faith, though she maintained it until the death of her brother during the Battle of the Somme. She did not remarry and had no issue. In New Zealand, she maintained a correspondence with poet Ursula Bethell. In published works In 2013, Katherine MacInnes published a book about Wilson entitled Love and Death and Mrs Bill: a play about Oriana, wife of Polar explorer Edward Wilson.

At four weeks gestational age in the human embryo the neural tube has developed at the cranial end into three swellings ‚Äì the primary brain vesicles. The space into which the cranial part of the neural tube is developing is limited. This limitation causes the neural tube to bend, or flex, at two ventral flexures ‚Äì the rostral cephalic flexure, and the caudal cervical flexure. It also bends dorsally into the pontine flexure. These flexures have formed by the time that the primary brain vesicles have developed into five secondary brain vesicles in the fifth week. Flexure development The neural tube has a longitudinal axis called the neuraxis, from the future brain area at the cranial end, to the conus medullaris of the spinal cord at the caudal end. By the fourth week in the human embryo, at its cranial end, three swellings have formed as primary brain vesicles. These vesicles form the future forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The three vesicles need to develop further into five brain vesicles but the space at the cranial end is limited. This causes the neural tube to bend ventrally at two flexures ‚Äì the first at the cephalic flexure and the second at the cervical flexure. A third flexure is oriented in the opposite dorsal direction as the pontine flexure. By the fifth week further flexion has taken place and the five secondary brain vesicles have formed. The angle formed by the two ventral flexures, the cephalic flexure and the cervical flexure together, is a right angle in the ventral direction between the axis of the body and the axis of the brain. The pontine flexure is located between these two flexures. Isthmic organizer at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. =Cephalic flexure= The cephalic flexure also known as the mesencephalic flexure, is the first flexure or bend that forms between the midbrain and hindbrain. The caudal part of the midbrain and the rostral part of the hindbrain makes up a mibrain-hindbrain boundary region known as the isthmic organizer. In human embryos it generally occurs at the end of the 3rd week or the beginning of the 4th. =Cervical flexure= The cervical flexure forms between the hindbrain and the spinal cord. =Pontine flexure= The pontine flexure, also called the rhombic flexure, forms the boundary between the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. The metencephalon becomes the pons and the cerebellum, and the myelencephalon becomes the medulla oblongata. These two regions develop and fold dorsally at the pontine flexure.

Typically, the dataset contains sensitive information about individuals, whose privacy needs to be protected. The attacker has no or only partial access to the dataset, but has access to public aggregate statistics about the datasets, which could be exact or distorted, for example by adding noise. If the public statistics are not sufficiently distorted, the attacker is able to accurately reconstruct a large portion of the original private data. Reconstruction attacks are relevant to the analysis of private data, as they show that, in order to preserve even a very weak notion of individual privacy, any published statistics need to be sufficiently distorted. This phenomenon was called the Fundamental Law of Information Recovery by Dwork and Roth, and formulated as \\"overly accurate answers to too many questions will destroy privacy in a spectacular way.\\"The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy by Cynthia Dwork and Aaron Roth.

Turner was baptized on 19 June 1712, the only son of Sir John Turner, 2nd Baronet, of Warham and his wife Anne Allen, daughter of Thomas Allen, London merchant. He was educated at. Greenwich school and was admitted at Middle Temple on 20 February 1729 and Christ's College, Cambridge on 9 January 1730. In 1736 he was called to the bar. He succeeded his father to the baronetcy on 6 January 1739. Turner was returned as Member of Parliament for King's Lynn at a by-election on 9 February 1739 in succession to his uncle, Sir Charles Turner, 1st Baronet. He voted with the Government in every recorded division. He was returned unopposed at the 1741 British general election, and won in a contest at the 1747 British general election. Turner married Miss Stonehouse on 20 October 1746. She died in 1749 and he married again to Frances Neale, daughter of John Neale of Allesley, Warwickshire. Turner was returned unopposed for King's Lynn again at the 1754 British general election, On 3 May 1757 he voted for Townshend's motion on the Minorca inquiry in opposition to Newcastle and Fox. At the 1761 British general election, he was again returned unopposed. He made his first recorded speech, on 14 December1761, to second Lord Strange's bill to make the militia permanent. He followed Bute, and in May 1762 was appointed Lord of Treasury when Bute became its first lord. He remained in office under Grenville, and supported the Administration over Wilkes and general warrants, but apparently took no part in the debates. When the Rockingham Administration took over, Turner lost his place in July 1765 and for a while continued to adhere to Grenville. He voted against the repeal of the Stamp Act. He became a bencher on his Inn in 1766. At the 1768 British general election there was a contest at King's Lynn, and Turner narrowly escaped defeat. He had become unpopular both on personal grounds and because of his attitude on general warrants. He seems to have lost interest in politics, and his only known vote in that Parliament was with Administration over the Middlesex election on 8 May 1769. His interest at King's Lynn had been seriously weakened, and he decided not to contest the borough at the 1774 British general election Turner died 25 June 1780, leaving two daughters, and was buried at Warham. On his death the baronetcy became extinct.

He also serves as the director of the USC Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture. His research focuses on Zen Buddhism, Buddhism in America, and the mixed-race Japanese (hapa) experience. Early life and education Duncan Ry≈´ken Williams was born in Tokyo, Japan. The child of a Japanese woman and a British man, Williams spent the first 17 years of his life in Japan and England. As an undergraduate, Williams attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. While attending Reed, Williams lived in a Zen Buddhist center, which inspired him to become ordained as a Buddhist priest. He was ordained as a S≈çt≈ç Zen Buddhist priest in 1993, when he became a monk at Kotakuji Temple in Nagano, Japan. At Harvard University, Williams was the university‚Äôs Buddhist chaplain from 1994 to 1996, before his completing a Ph.D. in religion in 2000.  Career  =Teaching and affiliations= Williams has taught courses at Brown University, Trinity College, UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, and USC. Previously Williams held the Shinso Ito Distinguished Chair of Japanese Buddhism at the University of California at Berkeley and served as the Director of Berkeley‚Äôs Center for Japanese Studies. Williams was the founding director of the USC Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture, USC‚Äôs first Japanese Studies center. =Author= The Other Side of Zen In 2004, Williams published his first monograph, The Other Side of Zen, with Princeton University Press. It was released in paperback in 2009. The title draws from Barbara Ruch's well-known essay, \\"The Other Side of Culture in Medieval Japan,\\" which points out the importance of historical scholarship on \\"common culture\\" shared by the majority of the population.\\" The Other Side of Zen challenges traditional studies of Japanese Zen Buddhism (which tend to focus on well-known teachers, Zen meditation, Zen gardens, and solving k≈çans), instead examining the practices of everyday monks and laypeople and placing them within a larger social history in the Tokugawa and early Meiji periods. Analyzing temple records, Williams discusses how, as the overseers of these larger systems of affiliation and registration, Buddhist clerics had power over their parishioners which manifested in social and economic pressure to support the temple with which they were affiliated. Williams also includes many anecdotes and stories to illustrate how ordinary people's lives were shaped by government policies and religious practices, making the book accessible to a more general readership. One review of The Other Side of Zen declares, ‚ÄúThis book is required reading for any student of Zen Buddhism or Japanese religion and will remain a standard reference for years to come.\\" American Sutra In 2019, Williams published his second monograph, American Sutra, with Harvard University Press. During World War II, the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans began with the FBI rounding up leaders of Japanese American communities; Buddhist priests were among the first to be incarcerated. American Sutra tells the story of Japanese American Buddhists (the largest group of Buddhists in the United States at that time in the context of anti-Japanese sentiment during World War II and draws parallels to contemporary challenges to religious freedom facing Americans today. To understand and document this history, Williams conducted bilingual research, including translating four volumes of diaries written by a Buddhist priest incarcerated at a high-security camp in Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1941-45 and obtaining and declassifying FBI documents that show that nearly 300 priests were picked up by the FBI after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Japanese American scholars have noted how the book provides a new perspective on a familiar topic because of the bilingual sources Williams uses and the Buddhist framing of, for example, the Japanese American soldiers who served in the 100th Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team and the Military Intelligence Service during World War II. =Other projects= Williams has organized ‚ÄúHapa Japan Festivals\\". These are multiple days celebrating the multiracial Japanese experiences globally. They typically include academic conferences, comedy shows, musical performances, film screenings, interviews, receptions, book fairs, art and photography displays, and an exhibit on multiracial Japanese Americans in the United States at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. Williams also published two edited volumes, Hapa Japan: History and Hapa Japan: Identities and Representations, in 2017. This is the first time so many essays have been published together on the history, identification, and representations of global mixed-race people of Japanese descent. Awards and honors In 2011, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Consulate- General of Japan commended Williams for his work on a series of events at UC Berkeley‚Äôs Center for Japanese Studies. The event series deepened the relationship between the United States and Japan, which is why he was commended. In May 2015, Williams hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who met with staff and faculty at the Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture as part of his visit to USC, where Abe had spent three semesters as a student in 1978. From 2016-2017, Williams served as the Executive Vice President and Planning Director of Japan House/LA, a public diplomacy initiative of Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Ustick platted the farming community of Ustick on his property, six miles west of Boise. The Ustick post office was established in 1908 and closed in 1958. Dr. Ustick helped to organize the Boise Valley Railroad, later the Boise Interurban Railway, a trolley line that included a station at Ustick, and Dr. Ustick briefly served as president of the company. The Ustick School District, also known as District #37, was formed in 1909 from parts of other districts, and in that year the Ustick community approved construction of Ustick School by a vote of 72 to 3. By 1910 the schoolhouse was considered \\"one of the best new school buildings in the county.\\" A gymnasium was added to the building after 1911, and it was demolished after 1967 and before the school's listing on the NRHP in 1982. The school was closed in the mid 1950s, but the gymnasium was in use as a cannery for Allen's Custom Cannery of Fruitland in the 1960s. The cannery continued to operate at the school in the 1970s. By 1999 Ustick School had been converted into a house, and by 2008 the building had been divided for apartments.

Holes is known for his contributions to solving the Golden State Killer case using advanced methods of identifying the killer with DNA and genealogy technology. Since retiring in March 2018, Holes has contributed to books, television, and podcasts about the Golden State Killer and true crime.  Education  Holes studied at the University of California, Davis, from 1986 to 1990. There he received his Bachelor of Science in biochemistry.  Investigative career  Holes was sworn in as an investigator for the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office in Martinez, California, in 1994. In the same year, Holes first discovered the cold case files of the East Area Rapist (EAR). His interest in the case was ignited and he remained close to the files, reviewing them any chance he had between active cases in Contra Costa County until a DNA break in 2001 expanded the case even further. When DNA from the EAR matched other unsolved murder crimes throughout California, the case again gained traction and had expanded in evidence. After years of gathering evidence and using as many DNA samples as he could without depleting the evidence, Holes made contact with genealogist and scientist Barbara Rae-Venter. Rae-Venter used DNA from the Golden State Killer to construct a genetic profile of the suspect and create a family tree that was detailed enough to narrow down the suspects to Joseph James DeAngelo. In March 2018, Holes visited the Citrus Heights home of DeAngelo on his final day as an investigator before his retirement. Holes watched the home for the activity of DeAngelo, who at the time was only a leading suspect tied to the Golden State Killer rapes and murders. Holes decided not to approach the home for fear of causing a disturbance or tipping off DeAngelo of any suspicion of his involvement as a suspect in the case. Using discarded DNA samples from DeAngelo's home, detectives were able to match his DNA to that known to be from the Golden State Killer. DeAngelo was later taken into custody by the Sacramento Police on April 24, 2018. While researching the EAR case, it began to be strongly suspected by some that another high profile unsolved case, the Visalia Ransacker, and the EAR were the same person based on evidence similarity. However, unlike the Golden State Killer case, no current DNA link existed. In a 2017 interview, Holes was skeptical of the link between the two, based on credible witness descriptions, but changed his mind after the DeAngelo arrest.  The Murder Squad  In 2019, Holes and investigative journalist Billy Jensen released a true crime podcast called The Murder Squad that explores evidence and discussions of current unsolved murders, unidentified remains, and missing persons cases. The weekly podcast is a production of Exactly Right, a podcast network created by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, hosts of My Favorite Murder.  Personal life  Holes is currently married and has two adult daughters and one adult son.  In the media  Holes became an internet sensation following the attention of his role while investigating and contributing to the writings of the Golden State Killer case with Michelle McNamara, the now deceased writer and creator of the famous Golden State Killer name. He has also been a celebrated name with Murderinos, fans of the My Favorite Murder podcast, which started the #HotforHoles fanbase. Holes has been published and featured in many media outlets in discussion with the Golden State Killer leading up to and following DeAngelo's arrest. 2000 * Cold Case Files: Season 2, episode 22 2009 * MysteryQuest: Season 1, episode 3 * THS Investigates: The Original Night Stalker 2016 * Crime Watch Daily: Season 2, episode 52 2017 * 48 Hours: Season 30, episode 34 * 48 Hours on ID: Season 8, episode 20 * On the Case with Paula Zahn: Season 15, episode 3 * Casefile True Crime Podcast: Case 53: EAR/ONS; Bonus episode #2: Interview with Paul Holes 2018 * Evil Has a Name: The Untold Story of the Golden State Killer Investigation: audiobook writer, narrator 2018-2019 * Unmasking a Killer: Season 1, episodes 1‚Äì7 2019-2020 * The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes 2020 *I'll Be Gone In The Dark  References  Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Law enforcement workers from California University of California, Davis alumni External Links * ","title":"Paul Holes"},{"id":"60505196","text":"Charles Augustus Schermerhorn (January 1, 1839 ‚Äì October 2, 1914) was an American real estate investor and insurance executive.

These guns were rebored late in the war and held in reserve between the wars then mobilized by France during World War II. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 305 mod√®le 1893/96 √† glissement started life as eight surplus Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893/96 naval guns which armed pre-dreadnought battleships of the Charlemagne, R√©publique, and Libert√©class. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period which consisted of a rifled liner reinforced by layers of hoops. The guns used a Welin interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. To load the gun the barrel was lowered to +3¬∞ and there was an elevated shell handling trolley at the rear. The eight guns for the Canon de 305 mod√®le 1893/96 √† glissement were first deployed as the Canon de 305 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ built by St. Chamond. The guns were removed from that chassis because the elevation was too low, the range was poor, balance was poor and the recoil forces were too great for that carriage to handle. In order to produce a better weapon, the guns were replaced with eight smaller Canon de 240 de c√¥te mod√®le 1893 coastal defense guns to produce the Canon de 240 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ. The carriages consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on two six-axle articulated rail bogies manufactured by Schneider. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. The carriage was similar to that used by the contemporary Canon de 370 mod√®le 75/79 Glissement produced by Schneider. Since the carriage did not have a traversing mechanism it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Six steel beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take the weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system. World War I The Canon de 305 mod√®le 1893/96 √† glissement first saw action during the Nivelle Offensive in the Spring of 1917 and the Flanders Offensive in the Summer of 1917. They also saw action during the German Spring Offensive of 1918 and during the Hundred Days Offensive in the Summer of 1918. After the barrels became worn out they were returned to Schneider and bored out to fire ammunition during 1918-19 and were designated Canon de 320 mod√®le 1917 √† glissement. These were placed in reserve between the wars. World War II Eight Canon de 320 mod√®le 1917 √† glissement guns were mobilized at the beginning of the Second World War by the French Army. Four guns were assigned to the fourth Heavy Artillery Battery of the 372¬∞ Regiment of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e) stationed at Aboncourt. The four guns were named (Sneezy, Dopey, Happy and Grumpy) after characters of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Four guns were assigned to the tenth Heavy Artillery Battery of the 373¬∞ Regiment of the ALVF stationed at Reguisheim. Guns captured by the Germans after the Fall of France were given the designation 32 cm Kanone (Eisenbahn) 651/1(f).

The oldest parts of the building date back to 1219. It is both a listed building and a scheduled Ancient Monument in the region. It is well known for being frequented by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1856, where he began writing Idylls of the King from the building's riverside views. A blue plaque now adorns the building, with another on the wall near his rumoured seat.  Description  The pub is formed from local rubbled stone, limewashed and decorated in 16th century style. Much of the original architecture remains untouched. The slate roof also consists of local Welsh stone. The windows were reformed in the 19th century and the interior remains in its true style.  History  Caerleon has historic origins as an Iron Age Silures hill fort. Upon the arrival of the Roman outposts across Britain, including at nearby Caerwent, the Isca Augusta fortress at Caerleon developed on the River Usk as an important route for goods and men into the country.. The first known construction on the site is a Norman tower built around 1219, which stands to this day. The purpose of the tower is uncertain, however two theories exist. One suggests that the tower was twinned with another on the opposite bank of the Usk, and together served as a chain tower allowing access to the upper river. Other historians claim it formed the outer bailey of the village. In the 1600s, Caerleon's quay grew, likely in a similar to the much earlier Roman docks that are now buried, and the Hanbury Arms established itself as an important presence on the riverside. The current building began as a home and trading post named Ty Glyndwr, built by the local Morgan family. The building dates to 1565 and was later used in the 17th century as a Magistrate's Court. The aforementioned Norman tower was appropriately used during this time as a lock-up.  Present era  The modern premises operates as it did in the 18th century, as a public house now operated by Cardiff-based Welsh brewery S.A. Brain. The business operates until 11.30pm during weekends. It hosts regular live performances from local and international musicians, especially so during the yearly Caerleon Arts Festival each summer.

Biography Muster roll of American Revolutionary War soldiers from 1783 with Sergeant Jonathan Nicholas at the top. Jonathan Nicholas was born in the Province of New Jersey, British America. Contemporary genealogy records state that Jonathan was born in Wales but a letter written by his son William in 1850 says he was born in New Jersey. There are no primary sources to indicate he was from Wales despite a book published in the late 19th century indicating this. His father and mother are also unknown. It is possible his father is a Price Nicholas as indicated on his christening document. Jonathan's birthday is given in several sources as April 1, 1756 or 1757. His tombstone listed him at 73 years old and 5 months in 1833 giving him a birthday around November 1759. However, Jonathan's christening was at St. John's Episcopal Church on May 22, 1757. Jonathan enlisted in the American Revolutionary War in spring 1777 at Elizabethtown reaching the rank of sergeant. Jonathan was under the command of Captain Pierson part of Colonel Oliver Spencer's regiment. Jonathan took part in the commissary department assisting in attaining water for the soldiers in winter 1778. In 1778 Jonathan was transferred to Jonathan Dayton's regiment and took part in the Battle of Monmouth and Siege of Yorktown. Toward the end of the war on June 5, 1783 Jonathan was transferred to Colonel Spencer's regiment in New York where he was discharged from the war. At the end of the war General Nathanael Greene gave Jonathan a cane for his service. After the war, Jonathan became a barrel maker and a settler in Flanders near Bottle Hill, in what is now Mount Olive Township, New Jersey. In 1799 Jonathan purchased in Flanders for farming where he had a house built which housed his children and grandchildren. His grandson David Ayers Nicholas built a new house on the site of Jonathan's house which still stands today. The Nicholas house and land had been in the Nicholas family for over 125 years. In February 1810 Jonathan filed for a pension with district judge William Pennington because he was in need of financial assistance. Jonathan had assistance with Jonathan Dayton, at the time the former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senator from New Jersey, by providing a testimony honoring Jonathan's service in his regiment. Jonathan began his pension for serving in the American Revolutionary War on February 16, 1819, suspended May 1, 1820 due to the Revolutionary War Pension Act and restored July 7, 1823. Family Jonathan married Irish immigrant Elizabeth Lawler on May 16, 1779. Jonathan and Elizabeth had 12 children: Hannah, Nancy, John, Rhece, Jonathan Jr., David, Elizabeth, Lewis, Josiah, Elias, William and Jerusha. Jonathan's grandson David Ayers Nicholas organized the First Presbyterian Church of Flanders in 1852, elected one of the first elders in Flanders, and one of the original stockholders of the First National Bank at Morristown. David organized the Pleasant Hill Cemetery where Jonathan was buried. In 1916 Jonathan's great grandson David Oscar Nicholas became the first Nicholas to join the Sons of the American Revolution.

The game is one of the first open world adventure games ever made, and focuses on the search for a lost classmate in a small rural American town. The game has never been localized outside of Japan, but fan translation projects have attempted to translate it. Plot The game takes place in Mizzurna Falls, a fictional town in Colorado near the Rocky mountains. On Christmas Day 1995 a young girl, Kathy Flannery is discovered unconscious in the forest, apparently attacked by a bear. Soon after, high school student Emma Rowland goes missing. Emma's classmate Matthew Williams becomes involved in the mystery surrounding the disappearance and the dark secrets of the town. Gameplay The player has seven days to explore the town and countryside talking to the residents in order to solve the mystery. One in game hour is around five minutes in real time. The strict seven day time limit makes it difficult to see all the events and get the best of the three endings. The player can save the game by sleeping for either one or five in game hours. The game features the \\"tank style\\" movement controls made famous by Resident Evil, fighting and shooting systems and quick time events. The game also features a full weather cycle and the residents of the town have individual daily routines. The player has access to a Volkswagen Beetle and a boat to move around town quickly. Matthew can eat at the local dinners, and must keep his car fueled. Matthew can also use his mobile phone to call other characters and certain businesses in the town.  Development and release  It is the only game by its writer and director Taichi Ishizuka, who followed this by moving to Canada as a nature guide. The game is reminiscent of Twin Peaks. The game was released on December 23, 1998 in Japan for the Sony PlayStation, and was published by Human Entertainment themselves. The game was never localized nor published in the West.  Reception and legacy  Upon release, four reviewers from Famitsu gave it a score of 22 out of 40. Its legacy is in being one of the first open world video games. Rolling Stone commented that the title was \\"quirky, weird, and rife with references to a cornucopia of media, namely Twin Peaks, and traces of it can now be seen in cult favorites like Deadly Premonition.\\" =Localization attempts= For a while the game was \\"little more than a 20-year-old curiosity\\" according to Waypoint, which could only be played via poor emulation or by purchasing a Japanese version of the game. However, in 2017 Tokyo-based freelance translator Resident Evie translated the script into English as part of a playthrough project. She also set up the Tumblr Project Mizzurna, a hub for discussions and content around the game. Evie noted that \\"The game was so innovative that it was even slightly broken\\". In mid-2019, an unofficial English localization patch based on Evie's translation was released in an incomplete state. However, the patch was quickly pulled off various sites due to a copyright complaint, as the publisher had compiled all the code from the authors without permission. In late 2019, a game translator under the pseudonym \\"Mr.Nobody\\" published a Spanish translation patch based on the aforementioned English patch, making it possible to play the game in Spanish.

She reports about and creates content regarding politics, arts, social justice and music photography. Early life Tobak's family immigrated to Detroit, Michigan in the late 1970s when she was five years old. In an interview given to journalist Ben Merlis for the online magazine udiscovermusic.com she commented on her early musical experience, ‚ÄúI landed in Detroit ‚Äì a predominantly black city, predominantly music-oriented city, where music is everywhere you go. You hear Motown, you hear Aretha and Stevie Wonder, that was my impression of what America was from the start.\\" In Cold War America, some of her white classmates often treated her with mistrust, whereas the black community, she says, welcomed her with open arms. It was in Detroit that she immersed herself into early hip hop culture. New York groups like Public Enemy and EPMD were writing about creating identity and demanding respect. The movement inspired her to be closer to the pulse. As a teenager, Tobak moved from Detroit to New York City where, after working for a time as a cashier and doorwoman at the nightclub called Nell's, she got an entry-level job at Payday Records, the label known for such hip hop performers as Gang Starr, Guru, DJ Premier, Jeru the Damaja and Mos Def. After just a few months at the company she was promoted to marketing and PR director, which included organizing photography sessions for the artists. She continued to work in the music industry throughout the nineties, experiences that gave her a behind-the-scenes perspective on the rise of hip hop culture. Her insider knowledge on the subject segued into work as a music journalist and also as a music photography curator. Career In 2018, she authored the book Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop (published by Penguin Random House/Clarkson Potter). The book features analog photography sessions of hip hop legends complemented by the photographers' personal stories about the images. The Contact prints featured span from the very beginnings of the Hip hop genre until the end of the regular use film photography for music pictures (2007). The book was considered one of Time Magazine's 25 Best Photobooks of 2018. and the New Yorker described the publication as a \\"Wondrous tribute to the way hip-hop overturned not just the sound of culture but also ways of seeing.\\" In 2019, The Annenberg Space For Photography in Culver City, California hosted an exhibit entitled Contact High: A Visual History of Hip Hop, based upon the contents of the book in association with the museum's 10th anniversary. The exhibit was curated by Tobak along with creative direction from hip hop artist and journalist Fab Five Freddy. In an interview given to Quartz regarding the exhibit, Tobak stated (specifically in reference to the photographers' contact sheets), ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rare glimpse into their process and allows viewers to see so much more than the final product\\".

Isosaari () is an island in Helsinki, part of the Ulkosaaret district of the city, more specifically of It√§saaret, i.e. ‚Äòeastern islands‚Äô. It was one of the fortified islands of the Gulf of Finland. Isosaari is one of the outermost islands in the Helsinki region, and it is a site that is important from the perspective of cultural history. Its sights and its nature are unique. General information The island covers an area of 76 hectares. It is mainly covered by a coniferous forest. The island had a fortress of the Finnish Defence Forces until January 2012, when the training of conscripts on the island ceased and the island remained a training ground and a guard fortress. The island is located 3.8 kilometres to the south of Santahamina. It is two kilometres long and one kilometre wide at its widest.Otavan Iso tietosanakirja, Otava 1968, vol. 2 p. 1375 The ferry ride from the Helsinki Market Square takes little over half an hour.

Isosaar maritime surveillance station Rikama, in September 2013 A coastal gun 130 53 TK The fortification works on Isosaari were begun in 1913. The batteries with heavy guns were completed in 1915. Since then the island fortress played a significant role in the evolution of coastal artillery in Finland and in the defense of capital of the nation. When the training of conscripts ended in Isosaari, it was transferred to the Upinniemi garrison. During the independence of Finland, the Isosaari fortress was a unit under the Suomenlinna Coastal Regiment, responsible for the training of conscripts and all other functions on the island. =Training of conscripts= A total of ca. 300 conscripts were trained on the island every year. As of 2012, this training ended, but various special courses are still held on the island. On these courses, firing position men, marines, maritime surveillance men, fortress launchers and military police were trained. In addition to these, firing position NCOs were trained, as well as logistics men, scribes, headquarter couriers and gunsmiths. The fortress was responsible for its own standby troops, and due to the small number of conscripts, they had fewer weekend leaves than other conscripts in the country, and during the evenings they were not allowed to travel to the mainland. The standby functions included guard duty, maritime surveillance, and the ability to fire warning shots from one of the 130 mm cannons on the island. In addition to this, the men of the fortress were responsible for guard duty at the Naval Academy on the island of Pikku-Musta in Suomenlinna. The military police of the fortress was responsible for many standby tasks. Marine surveillance based on sensory perception has been discontinued, just as it has on other fortresses in Finland. The Finnish Defence Forces are responsible for the guarding of the island as well as its logistics and transportation to and from the island. In the old days, boats came to the island from Santahamina three times a day. The weather and maritime surveillance station During 1984‚Äì2008 the Defence Forces operated a weather station on the island, making observations on behalf of the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The weather observations were made by conscripts, who had been trained in the Artillery Brigade in Niinisalo. Every three hours they sent a SYNOP telegram, which included information on the temperature, the relative humidity, wind speed and direction, quality of clouds and their lower limit and total number, as well as the barometer reading, visibility and meteorological phenomena. On its 24th anniversary, on 1 October 2008, the Isosaari weather station ceased it operations. Before 1984, the weather station was located on Katajaluoto. There are still automated weather stations on the sea outside Helsinki, e. g. in the Harmaja Lighthouse. The coastal surveillance station at the southern tip of the island is known as \\"Rikama\\", in honour of Colonel Johan Rikama. Actually, Rikama did not have anything to do with the coastal surveillance station, but he was actively involved in the development of the country's coastal defense and especially of the fire control of the coastal artillery. His ashes were scattered to the south of Isosaari, and a stone was erected on its southern shore in his memory. Memorial plaques for him and Lieutenant General Eino J√§rvinen can be found on the stone. J√§rvinen died while participating in the inauguration ceremony of the stone.Salli Huotilainen, Is√§n kuvaa korjaamassa, Kymen Sanomat 22.2.2009Anu Vuorinen: Isosaari P√§√§kaupungin etuvartio. The grave of George Quinnell The grave of the English Able seaman George Quinnell is located on Isosaari. He participated in 1855 in what is in Finland known as the √Öland War, the British and French naval campaign on the shores of Finland in connection with the Crimean War, as part of the crew of HMS Amphion (1846). The Amphion was trying to sound the Viipuri Channel, but encountered fire from both Santahamina and Matosaari in Laajasalo, as well as from five gun boats. One cannonball from Santahamina hit Quinnell in the head, and took it to the sea. The corpse was identified from the insignia. He was one of the few British casualties in the operation in the Helsinki waters. The body was buried in Isosaari, as the dead could not be transported home without serious health hazards. Quinnell was 35 when he died. A wooden cross was placed on the grave, with the text: \\"Sacred to the memory of George Quinnell. I. H. S.\\" Towards the end of the century, a British wife of a Finnish merchant erected a permanent stone on the grave, on to which the text was copied. Representatives of the Royal Navy and the British ambassador to Finland with his spouse have placed a wreath on the grave on the occasions of the 100th and 150th anniversaries of the battle. Tradition says that Quinnell's widow haunts the grave, which has now become a site of interest for tourists. Prison camp In 1918, the Isosaari Prison Camp was operated on the island, to which members of the Red Guards and Russian soldiers were placed. It was a place where the Whites placed especially prisoners who were considered to be \\"politically dangerous\\". More than 300 prisoners died on the island.Nieminen, Jarmo: \\"Santahamina 1918, OSA XI\\" Retrieved 13.2.2014. Most of the dead were buried in Santahamina, with only a fraction buried in Isosaari. A black stone was erected in 1955 in the memory of those who died on the camp. It is located on the grounds of the former prisoner camp, on the likely site of the mass grave.Ty√∂v√§enmuseo Werstas: \\"Punaisten muistomerkit, Helsinki\\" Retrieved 10.9.2014. Tourism In 2017, Senate Properties (Finland) rented out the island and its buildings to Suomen Saaristokuljetus so that year-round tourism could be developed on the island. The island was opened to the public in June 2017. It is expected to become a popular destination for visitors and tourists, especially during the summer. The island has two restaurants, two beaches for swimming, a shooting range, a barracks building, three saunas next to the shore and a number of quarters for the staff. The island also houses a 9-hole \\"golf course\\", where the public can play golf. Cruises for golfing are arranged on Mondays.Armeijalla on Suomen vaativin par-3 kentt√§, retreaved 2 July 2011 As of 2017, only one person resided regularly on the island.

History The temple was originally built in 1341, during the Mongolian-ruling Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). It was rebuilt in the reign of Wanli Emperor (1573-1620) of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The temple was enlarged in the Shunzhi (1644-1661) and Kangxi periods (1662-1722) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). In 1658, abbot Tongzheng () supervised the restoration of the entire temple complex. Yifeng Hall (), Caoxi Humble Cottage (), Xigong Hall (), Qinghua Pavilion () and other halls were added to the temple. Of them, Qinghua Pavilion was the most prestigious structure. In early Qing dynasty, the 3rd-generation abbot of the temple and a few of his successors were specialized in either painting, epigraphy or poetry, so literati and scholars often held poetry saloons and literary discussions in the temple, giving the temple a deep cultural heritage. A modern renovation of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1991. The temple was officially reopened to the public in 1995. On November 6, 2018, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited the temple.

She was sold in 1814. Construction She and her sister ship were constructed of fir. The motive for the use of pine ‚Äì an inferior material for shipbuilding ‚Äì was speed of construction. It was much quicker to build a ship with this material than one of oak; the drawback was that these fir-built ships were less durable than oak-built ships. The two fir-built ships underwent design alterations necessary for fir wood, notably a flat, square tuck stern. Career Captain George Duff commissioned Glenmore in April 1796 for the North Sea. She was on the Irish station between 1797 and 1798, and thereafter. In December 1799 Glenmore and were escorting the West India convoy from Cork.

On 15 May 1801 Lloyd's List (LL) reported that Glenmore had recaptured two merchant vessels that had fallen prey to the French privateer Braave. One vessel was Camilla, Preston, master, which had been sailing from Grenada to Liverpool. The other was Guiana Planter, Wedge, master, which had been sailing from St Kitts to Portsmouth.

On Broadway, Olivette appeared in Music Box Revue, Queen High, George White's Scandals, The Sweetest Little Devil, Captain Jinks, and Hold Everything! Much of Olivette's career was spent in comedic roles. Her first straight role came in Twin Beds (1954).

Starting with a dance such as the Black Bottom or Charleston, she said that she relaxed her muscles, \\"then [I] try to give the appearance of falling apart while performing it.

Education  Comte earned a B.A. in visual arts from l‚ÄôEcole Cantonale d‚ÄôArt de Lausanne, ECAL, Switzerland and an M.A. in science of education from Haute Ecole P√©dagogique, Visual Arts, Lausanne, Switzerland.  Work  Comte's artwork shows a wide range of influences that range from canonized artists, such as Brancusi and Jean Arp, to popular cartoons, like The Simpsons. She mixes the natural with the artificial, dissolving distinctions between what is considered intellectual and unsophisticated. In an interview with The Brooklyn Rail in 2015, Comte said she mixes classical themes with references to modern art, and then imparts her own voice on the form. Comte values the physical labor required to create her artwork. While in art school, Comte's classmates nicknamed her la tron√ßonneuse, Miss Chainsaw. The chainsaw has been Comte's tool of choice. However, Comte has asserted that her chosen tool, \\"has nothing to do with feminism or any other political act.\\" Rather, it is the only tool that manipulates the material in the way she wants.

Biography  He was ordained a priest by Bishop Alejandro Menchaca Lira on 8 July 1968. On 31 January 1995, Pope John Paul II named him titular bishop of Lamiggiga and Military Ordinary of Chile. He received his episcopal consecration from Archbishop Piero Biggio on 2 April. John Paul appointed him Bishop of Valpara√≠so on 4 December 1998. On 18 May 2018, Duarte submitted his resignation to Pope Francis, as did all the Chilean bishops at the conclusion of a three-day meeting in Rome. On 11 June 2018, Pope Francis accepted his resignation as bishop. Francis replaced him with an Apostolic Administrator as he did all bishops who retired following his personal intervention in the clerical sexual abuse crisis in Chile. On the day Francis accepted Durate's resignation, he also accepted those of two other Chileans, Bishop Juan Barros Madrid of Osorno, who had been at the center of Chile's controversy over sexual abuse by clergy, and Archbishop Cristi√°n Caro Cordero of Puerto Montt, who like Duerte had submitted his resignation months earlier at the age of 75 as required. It initially seemed that the resignations of Caro and Duerte were unrelated to the sexual abuse scandal, that they were \\"customary\\" resignations because of age. But several former seminarians immediately accused Duerte of sexual abuse. After refusing to comment for several weeks, Duarte said he had tendered his resignation months earlier as required when he turn 75 and that his resignation was unrelated to charges of sexual abuse. He said one complaint against him had been dismissed in court as \\"without merit\\" and said a second one misinterpreted an encounter that had nothing sexual about it. Civil authorities heard testimony from Duerte about charges he covered up for abusers on 21 November 2018, The accusers continue to press their case and expressed satisfaction with the progress they were making with the new Apostolic Administrator of Valparaiso, Bishop Pedro Ossand√≥n.

As the second oldest military chorus and instrumental ensemble (after the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Korean People's Army), it serves as one of the outstanding premier musical ensembles within the whole KPA proper and has been hailed as a model institution. It has been in existence since February 1947.  Brief history  The ensemble was established on February 25, 1947 by orders of the founding Premier of the DPRK and Supreme Commander of the KPA, Kim Il-sung, as a subdivision of the General Political Bureau of the KPA's arts and culture section, and performed its first public concert on that day, which has been marked as its anniversary ever since. The SMCSO-KPA has been one of the more experienced of the military arts ensembles of North Korea, having made appearances in many events concerning the KPA, the Worker's Party of Korea and the nation at large. During the Korean War, musicians and singers of the Chorus performed at the front lines before servicemen and women of the KPA, and many were decorated with state orders and decorations for valorious participation in the war effort. Postwar, it became one of the premier musical ensembles of the growing nation, and attention was given to its performances that featured songs praising the leadership of the country and helped in the propagation of the cult of personality of the state, the importance of Juche, economic progress and of national defense against the United States and its allies, and the building of a socialist future for the country and the world. Through its 7 decades of existence the Chorus was also privileged to perform before many foreign heads of state and government in their state visits to the country. In the mid-1990s up to his death in 2011, Kim Jong-il, in his capacity as Supreme Commander, attended many of its holiday and special concerts and made the Chorus a model musical group as part of the campaigns to strengthen the Songun ideology of the KPA and as an ambassador of North Korean music to the world. Many of his appearances in its concerts inspired the ensemble's musicians and singers to work harder to fulfill the tasks set by the Party and the KPA to provide the people with revolutionary-styled songs that portray the country as one that is strong, prosperous and independent, led by the Supreme Leaders, guided by the WPK in its pursuit of living the national ideology and defended to the last by the men and women of the People's Army, the armed forces guided by the Songun political ideology. Also, the Chorus made music videos shown daily on Korean Central Television of many of its best compositions, with the rise of pro-DPRK channels on social media sites like YouTube in the mid-2000s, the videos of their songs exposed the men of the ensemble and its symphonic orchestra to online viewers outside the country (except in South Korea, where such videos have been banned). In the late 2000s the Chorus began its series of collaboration concerts then with the now defunct Unhasu Orchestra and the Samjiyon Band and Orchestra, in an effort to update its musical selections, in 2015 it resumed its collaboration concerts, this time, with the Moranbong Band and the Chongbong Band appearing occasionally. Kim Jong-un's administration saw the modernization of the ensemble and of its instrumentation to keep up with the times and formally included women soloists and instrumentalists beginning in 2014 as it transitioned into a dynamic musical group and the KPA's flagship ensemble, adopting pop-styled music in addition to its usual classical, ideological and patriotic music compositions performed in its concert schedules, some of which he attended personally in his capacity as Supreme Leader of the Republic and Supreme Commander of the KPA. To mark the 70th year of the WPK in 2015, the Chorus, as part of the \\"Songs Full of Memories\\" concert series (February‚ÄìMarch), also performed with musicians from both the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble and the Wangjaesan Light Music Band.http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2015/201510/news14/20151014-16ee.html In 2019, it gained a permanent home at the WPK Central Committee Annex Building in Pyongyang, following years of performing in major concert halls in the capital, using a new set of white dress uniforms (debuted 2018), which are used occasionally with the new styled khaki uniforms, used since 2015 in concert performances. It began performing overseas after many years in September 2015, when it performed in Moscow to mark the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory in the Pacific, followed by an impressive performance in January 2019, when it performed at the National Concert Hall in Beijing, China. On June 21, 2019, the Chorus and Symphony Orchestra played in the formal reopening night of the 2019 Arirang Mass Games \\"People's Country\\" at Pyongyang's Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in the presence of both Kim Jong-un and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping.

Such devices are now commonplace and may be purchased in a range of qualities, from dollar stores and upwards. The FuelRod does not have a capacity marked on it, but this has been estimated at around 1,000 mAh. This would be a typical capacity for a bank with a single 18650.  Business model  FuelRod have two business transactions with their users. They sell the basic device, either by vending machines in popular locations, such as transport hubs and theme parks, or online. Secondly these vending machines or 'swap boxes' also allow the user's flat powerbank to be exchanged for a freshly charged powerbank, for free. FuelRods have a purchase price of $20‚Äì30, depending on location. Other brands vary widely in price, but most are far cheaper than this, or a bank at a similar price can have a much greater capacity. Swapping a FuelRod is most usually free, although a fee may sometimes be charged. FuelRod's business model involves making a profit from the sale of the initial unit, greater than for other brands, and using this to cross-subsidise the swapping service. The premium pricing for the consumer is justified by the added convenience. However, this convenience has been questioned, given the small capacity of the bank and the likelihood of using multiple banks in a single day; a single, larger bank could be purchased for the same price.  History  FuelRod was developed by Chi Yau and Joe Yeagley as a mobile battery charger for use while traveling.

The mountain is situated in Chelan County, in the Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount David, to the northeast, and Indian Head Peak is to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from Whittier Peak drains into tributaries of the Wenatchee River. The peak was named for poet John Greenleaf Whittier by Albert Hale Sylvester, a pioneer surveyor, explorer, topographer, and forest supervisor in the Cascades who named thousands of natural features. Other peaks in the immediate vicinity named by Sylvester after poets include Irving Peak, Poe Mountain, Longfellow Mountain, and Bryant Peak. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is north of Whittier Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Whittier Peak, volcanic ash is common in the area. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Whittier Peak (right) from Poe Mountain Whittier Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

She lived in California where she became a teacher and principal in San Francisco. She is most known for her \\"equal pay for equal work\\" campaign in 1874 where she successfully lobbied the California legislature to support female teachers receiving the same pay as their male counterparts. Biography =Early years= Kate Kennedy was born in Gaskinstown, Ireland in 1827, the daughter of Thomas Kennedy, a gentleman farmer, and Eliza King. She was the middle child of six siblings; one older brother and five younger sisters. She attended a convent school in Navan until she was thirteen when her father died and the family lost their inheritance. With the family unable to send her younger sisters to school, Kennedy began teaching her younger sisters instead. Over time, Kennedy and her sisters learned French; Kennedy went on to learn German, Italian, and Spanish too. The Great Famine (Ireland) of 1845-1849, forced Kennedy, one sister, and her brother to leave Ireland. They arrived in New York City in 1849 where Kennedy and her sister got a job in embroidering; her mother and other sisters joined her in 1851. After a few years in New York, the family moved to California with Kennedy arriving in 1856. =Teaching and Equal Pay Campaign= By the time Kennedy had arrived in California, her sister Alice Kennedy, had already become a teacher for the San Francisco School Department in 1852. When Kate Kennedy arrived in 1856, she briefly taught in Suisun and took the teachers exam along with her sister Lizzie. In the 1860s, Kennedy became principal of the North Cosmopolitan Grammar School. Typical of 19th century America, women earned less than men for the same work; in Kennedy's case she earned $100 per month while her male counterparts earned $150. Because of this, Kennedy organized an \\"equal pay for equal work\\" campaign. The campaigned focused on allow more women into supervisory positions in public education as well as elected offices while paying them equally to men. In 1873, the California Legislature passed legislation opening op position for women; the following year the Legislature passed equal pay for equal work. While Kennedy benefited from the legislature, many female teachers did not; the legislation outlined both experience and education as qualifications for equal pay at a time when most women teachers did not have the same education as men, despite making up upwards of 90% of the teaching profession. Kennedy remained a prominent figure in public education. In 1886, Kennedy ran for California Superintendent of Public Instruction, the first woman in California to run for statewide office, though lost the election. =Later life= Following her defeat, she prepared for retirement. She traveled to Europe in 1887 and upon her return was transferred to Ocean View School. When the district transferred her, they demoted her and reduced her salary from $175 to $100. Two months into her new position, she was dismissed from the school \\"for political reasons.\\" Kennedy challenged her dismissal and sued the school district for her position and back pay, citing the California Tenure Law of 1881. The Supreme Court of California ultimately sided with Kennedy in 1890, affirming that \\"A teacher of any particular grade and with a proper certificate cannot be placed in a lower grade or dismissed except for misconduct or incompetency.\\" The Court also ruled she must be reinstated in her position, which she immediately resigned from, and granted her $5,700.75. However, she died in March 1890 before receiving her back pay. Instead, the compensation went to her estate, which used it to fund political movements Kennedy had been involved in. She was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery. =Legacy= Her contributions to public education have been reflected in several schools named after her in the San Francisco area. Organizations like the Kate Kennedy Parent-Teachers Association and the Kate Kennedy School Women's Club also played a role in the early 20th century to promote her contributions to teachers rights and public education.

His work was influential in using mathematics in developing the concept of centralization and in formalizing fundamental concepts of network structure. University of Iowa As one of Kurt Lewin's first graduate students, Bavelas went to University of Iowa from Springfield College trained on group work. He suggested to Lewin a method of training people to be democratic, which would become the germ of extending autocracy-democracy studies to the field of industrial relations. At Lewin's suggestion, Bavelas sought to directly apply small group dynamics theory to labor-management relations by conducting small- group experiments at the Harwood Manufacturing Company in Virginia, known as Harwood research.Harwood research#Introduction In implementing a program of collaborative research in Harwood, he created and developed the \`Echo approach' in the early 1940s. From 1940 to 1947, Bavelas and his successor John French were able to have many of Harwood's 600 workers and almost all of the managers in experiments. These proved to be successful in increasing worker productivity while maintaining good morale, and thus small-group research in industrial settings became Bavelas's forte. Move to Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bavelas moved with Lewin from Iowa to MIT. He also used the Echo approach in studying Mennonite children. Working in MIT the 1940s and 1950s, Bavelas used mathematics to formalize his theories on social networks. After Lewin's death in 1947, Bavelas stayed in MIT while many of Lewin's students transferred to the University of Michigan to create a new Center for Group Dynamics.http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/91.pdf In 1948, Bavelas obtained his PhD from MIT with Some Mathematical Properties of Psychological Space as his doctoral thesis with Dorwin Cartwright as his adviser. Years later, Frank Harary told Cartwright that Bavelas' PhD thesis showed an independent rediscovery of graph theory. In the late 1940s, Bavelas worked in the Industrial Relations section of MIT's Department of Economics & Social Science, then headed by Douglas McGregor. He founded the Group Networks Laboratory at MIT in 1948, which included mathematician R. Duncan Luce and social psychologist Leon Festinger. Bavelas experiments Bavelas designed studies focused on information diffusion within a small group and on network structures that affect the speed and efficiency of this information diffusion. Bavelas and his students‚Äîparticularly Harold Leavitt‚Äîconducted experiments on the effect of organizational structure on productivity and morale. In these experiments, small groups were given a task to complete, and then the communication structure was altered to determine if performance would be affected by a modification in the group structure. These experiments would be known as the 'Bavelas experiments' and would be described as social psychology experiments using five-person groups with four communication networks‚Äîa wheel, chain, Y-formation, and a circle. Results from the experiments show that centralized communication is productive to routine decision-making but the quality of decision-making for complex tasks is better with the decentralized communication networks. This gained admiration from organizational theorists and social psychologists, mainly due to turning a complex social situation into a quantifiable and controllable experiment. The experiments led to a notion where a central actor is relatively close to other actors in its network and is in optimal position for integrating information from the dislocated network parts. In 1950, Bavelas defined closeness as the reciprocal of the farness, that is, the sum of distance from all actors. This also led to the development of the centrality index, which was used as an indicator for how quickly information would travel through the network. He also looked at the development of theories, where experiments showed that the complexity of theories grow until a revolution throws it all away. Stanford University Bavelas left MIT in 1956 and worked for Bell Telephone Labs for four years. He then joined Stanford University's business school as a professor of psychology. He was a fellow for Stanford's Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences from 1954 to 1955. He was at Stanford until 1970 and he also taught at the University of Victoria in Canada. Death Bavelas died in Sidney, British Columbia on August 16, 1993.

The freshwater fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. There are about two million species of arthropods found in the world, and still it is counting with many new species still being discovered. It is very complicated and difficult to summarize the exact number of species found within a certain region. Freshwater habitats Freshwater animals are important to the economy of a country. The animal life in freshwater comprises a great diversity. The organisms ranging from tiny protozoa to large mammals in size. Sri Lanka is a hydraulic civilization. First civilizations in Sri Lanka were originated closer to main rivers in Sri Lanka such as Mahaweli, Kelani, Malwathu and Gin Ganga. Rivers in Sri Lanka flow in a radial pattern, from central hills where there are numerous waterfalls, the rivers flowing to the west, east and south being shorter than thoe flowing to north., north west and north east. Several streams join these rivers. Some of the streams in the hill country and mid country are quick flowing streams known as torrential streams. Sri Lankan freshwater habitats can be divided into 6 major types - river, stream, lake, pond, villu and paddy field - according to size, depth, rate of flow and type of bottom. Medium-sized rivers are called Oya and fast flowing streams torrential streams are called Dola in Sinhalese. The following list provide the freshwater fauna of Sri Lanka. Adaptations of freshwater fauna The life history of any animal is divisible into 3 phases, initially a period of slow development, followed by a rapid growth with a voracious apetite and finally to an adult which breeds at regular intervals and continue to grow slowly. Most freshwater animals breed during or after monsoon rains where water is available for the young to spread over a wide area where crowding is less and there is a plentiful supply of food in the form of minute plants and animals. During dry season, conditions in temporary habitats become less and less favourable for aquatic animals. Those cut off in small habitats are quickly killed off, others in larger habitats survive longer. During this period, food become scarce and water level reduces. Animals become weakened or diseased and die or are eaten by birds and terrestrial animals. Many freshwater animals show adaptations to drought conditions. Fish with air breathing ability, utilize atmospheric oxygen to moisten gills, mud burrowing ability are some of them. Smaller crustaceans, produce eggs with hard resistant covering capable of surviving even a severe drought. These cysts are blown by wind and the species is dispersed. Freshwater crabs and prawns carry their eggs until they hatch out, while leeches carry the young in a pouch. Researches on Sri Lankan freshwater fauna Knowledge of Sri Lankan freshwater fauna has been considerably enhanced in the last twenty years or so in two ways. One is through the publication of monographs. The other way is through Swedish Expedition and Smithsonian Institution. Several animals groups were identified extensively from Sri Lanka, such as fish, amphibians, odonates and arthropods. Other freshwater fauna of Sri Lanka need more detailed work, which are currently based on the notes of way back in British period. According to the National Red Data List in 2012, many freshwater habitats are degraded at an alarming rate due to rapid human interference. Habitat destruction, fragmentation and loss of forest cover has increased in past decade rapidly. The result becomes severe, where many amphibians have been not recorded after their discovery, which led the scientists to categorize Sri Lanka as an biodiversity hotspot.

She was the first woman to serve in a vice presidency role at an Ohio university. As a head coach of the field hockey and lacrosse teams, she logged more victories than any other coach in Kent State University history. She was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1986. Personal life Biles was born Fay Reifsnyder in Reading, Pennsylvania as the youngest of three girls. Her father, a former tennis player, ran a family business as a hosiery manufacturer. Growing up Biles was active in sports, playing both field hockey and lacrosse throughout her schooling years. Although she was inclined to attend Ursinus College as a pre-med student, her older sisters encouraged her to attend Duke University. She was one of two people selected from Philadelphia to attend Duke University. Biles is a member of Delta Delta Delta. While she was at Duke she met Bedford Biles, a World War II paratrooper who participated in D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge. The two married shortly after Biles graduated. Career After working as a high school teacher for four years, Biles began to study for her master's degree at Kent State University while simultaneously teaching and coaching at the University of Akron. She later earned her PhD in communications at Ohio State University. After earning her PhD, Biles taught health and physical education at Kent State. Besides teaching, Biles worked as a head coach for Kent State's field hockey and lacrosse teams from 1959 to 1972. She coached the 1963 field hockey team to a winning record with an undefeated season. She was the most successful coach in Kent State history. In 1966, Biles became the president- elect of the Physical Education Department for the Ohio College Association. In 1967, Biles and her husband bought a vacation home on Marco Island, Florida. After a survey conducted by the Physical Education Department revealed a lack of knowledge among the student body about the objectives of physical education programs, Biles began to construct the Physical Education Public Information (PEPI) program. In 1971, Biles took a year off from Kent State to help found PEPI. She returned to Kent State and presented her findings at an American Alliance's Convention. After her presentation, Biles received an offer from the new president of Kent State University, Glenn Olds, to become the Vice President for Public Affairs and Development. She was the first female vice president at Kent State University and in all of Ohio. While working as Vice President for Public Affairs and Development, Biles dealt with the repercussions of the Kent State shootings. As the spokesperson for the University, Biles detailed she received constant harassment, such as death threats, from students. Other activities In 1974, she ran as a Republican nominee for the 62nd District seat in the Ohio General Assembly. In 1975, she formed the Marco Island Taxpayers Association and remained its president until it ceased operation in 2014. She also served on the Emergency Medical Services Advisory Council and the Water and Wastewater Authority of Collier County.

The series follows a collection of ghosts from different historical periods haunting a country house while sharing the house with its new living occupants. The series is written and performed by many of the cast members of Horrible Histories and Yonderland. The series is the first post-watershed comedy by the ensemble, although some television critics noted that it was suitable for adults and children alike. Reviews of the series have been positive, with critics appreciating the high joke rate, the premise and the strength of the acting ensemble. The series was made by the production company Monumental Pictures, part of ITV Studios. It is filmed on location at West Horsley Place in Surrey. A second and third series were immediately commissioned and a Christmas episode will also be broadcast in 2020. Premise A young married couple, Alison and Mike, unexpectedly inherit the vast but crumbling Button Hall from a 99-year-old distant female relative of hers. The Hall is haunted by numerous squabbling ghosts from across the ages that died on its grounds, who are invisible and intangible to the living. Ignoring their solicitor's advice to sell the property, Alison and Mike decide to move in and renovate it, with the idea of turning the house into a luxury hotel. At first, the ghosts are not very happy with their plans and conspire to get rid of the newcomers. After various failed attempts to scare them, one of the ghosts pushes Alison from an upstairs window. When she awakes two weeks later from an induced coma, she discovers her husband has arranged a huge mortgage, and that she can see the ghosts due to her near-death experience. Initially imagining the ghosts to be an after-effect of her accident, Alison eventually accepts the truth and confronts them. Because neither she (for financial reasons) nor the ghosts (who are stuck there for eternity) can leave, both sides eventually agree that they have no choice but to coexist as best they can. Meanwhile, the house requires a lot of work, and Alison and Mike devise several schemes to assist their perilous finances. Cast * Charlotte Ritchie as Alison Cooper ‚Äì a young woman who has inherited a mansion from a very distant relative, who ‚Äì after a near-death experience caused by one of the ghosts ‚Äì is able to see and hear ghosts. * Kiell Smith-Bynoe as Mike Cooper ‚Äì Alison's husband, who has grand plans for the Hall but is not very adept at putting them into action, such as with building contracts and money managing. * Martha Howe-Douglas as Lady Fanny Button ‚Äì The ghost of a former owner from the Edwardian era. After she discovered her husband having a threesome with the groundskeeper and the butler, her husband pushed her out the window to protect his secret, an event she subconsciously re-enacts every time the clock chimes at three in the morning, the time of her death (prompting some of the other ghosts to set the clock back). Of all the ghosts, she is Alison's closest relative. She has the ability to appear in photographs. * Mathew Baynton as Thomas Thorne ‚Äì The ghost of a failed Romantic poet who was shot in a duel, and falls in love with Alison at first sight. * Simon Farnaby as Julian Fawcett MP ‚Äì The trouser-less ghost of a disgraced MP who died in a sex scandal in 1993. He has the ability to physically interact with the corporeal world, if he concentrates hard enough. * Lolly Adefope as Kitty ‚Äì The ghost of an overly chummy, naive Georgian noblewoman. * Laurence Rickard as Robin the Caveman ‚Äì The ghost of a caveman who lived on the land the Hall now occupies. He has the ability to flicker the lights in the house and is very good at chess, having spent centuries picking up knowledge despite his 'physical' limitations. **Rickard also appears as the head of Humphrey ‚Äì The ghost of a Tudor nobleman who struggles to have his body (played by Yani Xander) pick up his head after it has dropped him. * Ben Willbond as The Captain ‚Äì The ghost of a stern Second World War army captain, obsessed with wartime tactics, who shows increasing signs of being gay. * Katy Wix as Mary ‚Äì The rather slow-witted ghost of a witch trial victim burned at the stake, and constantly smouldering as a result. She has the ability (by walking through them) to make people smell burning. * Jim Howick as Pat Butcher ‚Äì The ghost of a friendly and polite scoutmaster who was accidentally shot through the neck with an arrow by one of his scouts in 1984. In addition to playing the ghosts who comprise most of the main characters, Howe-Douglas, Baynton, Farnaby, Adefope, Rickard, Willbond, Wix and Howick also play the ghosts of medieval plague victims whose bodies were buried beneath the house. While they have the ability to go upstairs if they wish, they choose to spend all of their time in the basement, and are experts on the house's heating system. Alison is also able to see ghosts outside of Button House, for example: Jemima (Anya McKenna-Bruce), a terrifying child plague victim who sings nursery rhymes to scare Button House's living residents (being the only ghost who can be heard by the living), a woman dressed in black with a pram at the side of a busy London road and two Second World War German pilots, who had died mid-air as they were about to land on British soil. She also sees the ghost of a pigeon that lived in Button Hall. Production West Horsley Place in Surrey, which appears as Button Hall in the series. Speaking as part of the BBC Press Pack for the series, Mathew Baynton recalled that the idea of a haunted house was one of the first ideas the writers developed after the end of Horrible Histories. However, they were initially uncertain because there was \\"no jeopardy that we could write into it\\" and they created the sitcom Yonderland for Sky One instead. However, after the ending of that series, they \\"realised the boredom of eternity and the existential aspects of the ghosts idea was unique...We realised it was a house-share sitcom ‚Äì and as soon as you stop thinking about those kind of major drama stakes, you unlock a story that is really domestic and petty.\\" Mike and Alison, the two living characters, were introduced as a foil to the ghosts, as well as to introduce \\"the stakes, the worries about money, life and everything you need for a story\\". Writing in Broadcast, Jim Howick notes that the 2016 episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in which Cockney EastEnders actor Danny Dyer discovered he was related to Edward III of England, formed the basis of the idea of Alison: \\"We loved the idea of Danny Dyer's royal lineage...We've mirrored this with our character Alison, who discovers her aristocratic roots, which she embraces immediately and takes on with relish\\". Matthew Baynton recalled that BBC head of comedy commissioning Shane Allen was looking for a pre-watershed primetime sitcom for BBC One. During the writing process, the intention was to make an adult show, but one that would appeal to older children, along the lines of Blackadder: \\"We wanted to do something that has a properly creaky atmosphere. I love the idea that some kids might stay up for it. It's great as a kid when you think something isn't quite for you and it's a bit cheekier.\\" In the event, the programme was scheduled at 9.30 on Monday evenings after the sitcom Not Going Out. Baynton noted in the i newspaper that the original audience of Horrible Histories would now be grown up \\"hopefully we're making something so they can continue to watch us!\\" Baynton said that for the writers the Tim Burton film Beetlejuice provided a \\"useful tonal reference\\" as did The Rocky Horror Show. Jim Howick, addressing its similarity to the 1970s series Rentaghost noted most of the writers were either slightly too young or too old to have watched it, but the series did make knowing use of many of the clich√©s of horror programmes such as headless Tudor noblemen. The programme is filmed at West Horsley Place in Surrey, England, a large country house unexpectedly inherited by the writer and former University Challenge presenter Bamber Gascoigne in 2014 from his great aunt, the Duchess of Roxburghe under circumstances not dissimilar to those depicted in the series. Some scenes were also filmed on London Road and Clandon Road in nearby Guildford. Filming of the second series started on 13 January 2020. On 12 September 2020 Baynton tweeted that the second series would begin airing on 21 September 2020 on BBC 1 Episodes =Series 1 (2019)= =Series 2 (2020)= Reception Critical reception to the series has been positive. Stuart Jeffries in The Guardian wrote that \\"In making us giggle at the supernatural, Ghosts is very British ‚Äì a mashup of No√´l Coward's Blithe Spirit and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), not to mention the manifold sillinesses of Hammer horrors. But it is American in the sense of having a gag-to-airtime ratio much higher than British sitcoms normally manage these days.\\" Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph was similarly positive, comparing it to the 1970s children's sitcom Rentaghost but noting that \\"This deliriously daft supernatural romp, however, was none the worse for that.\\" Susannah Butter in the Evening Standard said the first episode reminded her of a property show, watching the couple view a terrible flat, before making their escape to the country. She was critical of the post-watershed scheduling of 9.30pm, saying \\"it feels like a show that children would enjoy\\" and noting \\"This is a gentle ensemble comedy. Alison and Mike are wide-eyed, charming and likeable. I would gladly have them as friends, even though they can't sing...Nothing about this show is scary.\\" Carol Midgley in The Times was also confused by the scheduling, noting that \\"Ghosts is smut[-] and swearword-free\\" and calling it \\"a curiously life- affirming comedy about death\\". Comparing it to the bleak \\"sadcoms\\" such as Fleabag and After Life, Pat Stacey in the Irish Independent noted \\"It's joyously, infectiously silly, yet at the same time whip-smart. It's just the ticket to scare those sadcom blues away.\\" A second series was announced a week after the transmission of episode 6. The BBC Press Office announcement noted it received a consolidated average of 3.7 million viewers across the series, noting its popularity with 16‚Äì34 year-old viewers. On 8 October 2019, Rickard confirmed that a third series had also been commissioned.  Adaptation  An American adaptation of the series was announced on 29 November 2019 by CBS. On 4 February 2020, it was announced that pilot had been picked up and produced between BBC Studios, Lionsgate Television and CBS Television Studios.

Featuring an 8-bit aesthetic, it follows a cybernetic ninja named Shadow who sets out to rescue his clan in a world overrun by machines. The game is being mostly developed by Aarne Hunziker, who is the sole member of Mechanical Head Studios. It was first shown at PAX East 2019, having been in development from years before and silently announced before that event. It contains stated inspirations from other platform video games such as Ninja Gaiden. Gameplay Cyber Shadow is a side-scrolling platforming game in which players control a ninja character who battles enemies with a sword and various special abilities acquired as subweapons. It features an 8-bit aesthetic which shares similarities to Shatterhand and contains several gameplay elements of Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Castlevania and similar games, which include snaking paths and occasional backtracking. Several bosses are present. The game's story is told primarily through cinematic cutscenes, though in-engine ones are used as well. Plot The game's plot follows Shadow, a cyborg ninja who sets out to rescue his fallen clan in a world overrun by synthetic lifeforms harvesting them for their powers. It is specifically set in the ruins of the fictional Mekacity. Development Cyber Shadow is being developed by Mechanical Head Studios, a team consisting purely of the creator Aarne Hunziker, and published by Yacht Club Games. Aarne Hunziker, having already been developing the game for years on his own, initially had no intention of teaming up with a publisher; he was first discovered by Yacht Club while posting about the ongoing development on Twitter, and later was convinced by them to \\"join [their] little family\\". Although most of the development is handled by Hunziker, the music will be composed by Enrique Martin and produced by Jake Kaufman; in addition to their usual role as a publisher, Yacht Club is giving design feedback from their previous experience developing Shovel Knight. Hunziker's first experience in game development was hacking the ROMs of classic games to manipulate their visuals, effectively customizing them. He later decided to create an own game, but scrapped it four years later to begin coding from scratch what would become Cyber Shadow. He has had continued difficulties with the development of the game due to its scope and having to do it almost entirely alone. Hunziker has described the game as one that combines \\"the level design principles of Mario, the skills and action of Ninja Gaiden, the enemy designs of Contra and the dark visual aesthetic of Batman\\", but has also said that it is more deliberately intended as a callback to Shadow of the Ninja. In an interview with Siliconera, he said that \\"[t]he story is about exploiting carefully nurtured ancient knowledge with logic\\" as a reason why it involves both ancient ninjas and futuristic robots. The game was first shown at PAX East 2019, though it was announced less publicly earlier. It will be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows. In the \\"Yacht Club Games Presents\\" on February 26, 2020, it was revealed that the game would release in the Fall of 2020, and that the Shovel Knight Amiibo would be compatible with the Nintendo Switch version of the game.

Career  Hrabƒï de Angelis studied biology at Philipps- Universit√§t Marburg and completed his doctorate in 1994 with a dissertation on the influence of growth factors on early embryonic development (1985‚Äì1994). From 1994 to1997 he was a postdoc at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor (US). There he analyzed the delta/notch signaling pathway of the mouse and investigated mouse mutations as a model for somitogenesis. From 1997 to 2000, Hrabƒï de Angelis was head of the research group \\"Functional Genetics\\" at the Institute of Mammalian Genetics of the former Society for Radiation Research, GSF (now Helmholtz Zentrum M√ºnchen). Since 2000 he has been director of the Institute of Experimental Genetics at Helmholtz Zentrum M√ºnchen. In 2003 he was appointed to the Chair of Experimental Genetics at Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. At the same time, he is director of the pan-European research consortium INFRAFRONTIER. In 2001 Hrabƒï de Angelis founded the German Mouse Clinic (GMC) for the systemic analysis of human diseases. The main research focus is the elucidation of genetic and epigenetic factors of diabetes mellitus. Hrabƒï de Angelis was co-founder of the German Center for Diabetes Research in 2009. (DZD) (https://dzd-ev.de) and is a speaker and board member. He is a past-president (president 2017-18) of the International Mammalian Genome Society. Using a mouse model, Hrabƒï de Angelis has shown that dietary obesity and diabetes can be epigenetically inherited to offspring both via oocytes and sperm. By studying knockout mice, each of which lacked a precisely selected gene, he succeeded in identifying a network of genes that could play an important role in the development of metabolic diseases such as diabetes (3). Hrabƒï de Angelis has published more than 500 scientific articles in peer- reviewed journals (Google Scholar Citations: 26271) as well as numerous articles in reference books. His H index is 73 (as of March 2019).

Youth and education  Hanns Christian L√∂hr grew up in West Germany. After graduating from high school, he studied ancient, medieval and contemporary history as well as philosophy at the University of Hamburg and the University of Bonn. He completed his studies in 1988 with a master of arts degree. In 1992 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Bonn in history under Klaus Hildebrand, with a thesis on the foundation of the modern state of Albania and the outbreak of the First World War.Biographical information in: Die Albanische Frage, [Dissertation], Bonn 1992.  Scientific activity  Loehr's first book described the privatization of East German agriculture by the \\"Treuhandanstalt Berlin\\". Der Kampf um das Volkseigentum, Berlin 2000. Later he concentrated his scientific research on National Socialist art theft. In the course of this work he evaluated the photo file of the special commission Linz (\\"Sonderauftrag Linz\\") for the F√ºhrermuseum and the so called F√ºhrerbaukartei, which he was the first to identify in the archive of the former regional tax office Berlin, which was not open to the public at the time. Both card indexes show a large part of the works of art acquired by Adolf Hitler. As a result, a monograph on Hitler's looted art organization was published in 2005. Das Braune Haus der Kunst, Hitler und der ‚ÄûSonderauftrag Linz‚Äú; Visionen, Verbrechen, Akademie Verlag Berlin 2005. In 2009 he published an analog work on the collection of Hermann G√∂ring. Der Eiserner Sammler, Berlin 2009. In 2018, the last work in this series to appear was a study on the art theft carried out by Hitler's chief ideologist Alfred Rosenberg during the Second World War.Kunst als Waffe, Berlin 2018. L√∂hr thus published a trilogy on the three important National Socialist art thefts. The three books each contain a catalogue of lost works of art that have been missing since 1945. He published photographs of objects that had previously been largely unknown to researchers. In September 2009, the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office, together with the Central Institute for Art History in Munich, secured the painting \\"The Sermon on the Mount\\" by Frans Francken the Younger, which he had listed as a loss from Hitler's collection in his book The Brown House of Art.Sensationeller Fund in M√ºnchen, Das Bild der alten Dame, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 9-7-2009. He supplemented his academic work on National Socialist cultural policy with a study on the architectural and cultural plans, which Hitler wanted to realize in his former hometown of Linz on the Danube. Hitlers Linz, Berlin 2013.  Activity as editor  Together with the foundation German Historical Museum (represented by curator Monika Flacke) and the former Federal Office for Open Property Issues (represented by staff Angelika Enderlein), L√∂hr published the database on the \\"Special Commission Linz\\" on the Internet in 2008, which lists all works of art acquired for Hitler between 1939 and 1945.\\"The F√ºhrer's taste: Hitler's private collection goes virtual\\", Der Spiegel, 31-7-2008.

Gregory was elected Bishop of Gy≈ër by the cathedral chapter in 1224; according to a non-authentic charter, he already held the position since 1223.

He actively participated in their governance at the royal council. He led a royal campaign against the Teutonic Knights in 1225, who had attempted to eliminate the suzerainty of the Hungarian kings in their granted territory Barcas√°g (now »öara B√¢rsei, Romania) in Transylvania. During his episcopate, Gregory managed to resettle the Franciscan and Dominican friars in the Diocese of Gy≈ër.

Radha Krishna under their banners Geetha Arts and Haarika & Hassine Creations. The film stars Allu Arjun and Pooja Hegde, while Tabu, Jayaram, Sushanth, Navdeep, Nivetha Pethuraj, Samuthirakani, Murali Sharma, Rajendra Prasad, Sunil, Sachin Khedekar, and Harsha Vardhan play pivotal roles. The film features soundtrack composed by S. Thaman, while cinematography and editing were handled by P. S. Vinod and Naveen Nooli, respectively. The plot follows Bantu (Allu Arjun) who is hated and neglected by his father Valmiki (Sharma). Bantu later learns that his biological father is not Valmiki but a rich businessman, Ramachandra (Jayaram). Bantu enters Ramachandra's house, Vaikuntapuram to protect his biological family. The film was released theatrically on 12 January 2020, coinciding with Sankranti. It opened to positive reviews, with critics praising Allu Arjun and Murali Sharma's performances, Trivikram's writing and direction and Thaman's music. The film is a commercial success, with a gross , it ended up as one of the highest- grossing Telugu films.  Plot  Valmiki and Ramachandra start their career as clerks in the company of Ananth Radhakrishna, or ARK. Ramachandra who marries ARK's daughter, Yasu becomes wealthy while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both their children, Ramachandra's son appears to be dead. When nurse Sulochana informs Valmiki about this, he seizes the opportunity to secretly switch the child with his own, so that his son would have a better life. After switching them, however, the apparently dead child begins to cry. Sulochana tries to switch them back but Valmiki prevents her, pushing her accidentally off a ledge. Sulochana goes into a coma, while Valmiki gets a leg cramp that makes him limp permanently. Two boys grow-up in different ways. Raj, raised at Ramachandra's house is timid, innocent, and soft-spoken, while Bantu who is raised at Valmiki's house, is smart, outspoken, and hard-working. Valmiki who favours Raj treats Bantu with disgust due to his true parentage. After his MBA was denied by Valmiki, Bantu heads to interview for a job at a travel company headed by Amulya, a self made businesswoman. After a scuffle and misunderstanding with the company's HR manager Shekhar, Bantu lands a job. Eventually, Bantu starts catching feelings for Amulya. Bantu, Amulya, Shekhar, and Ravindra then go to Paris for a business trip, and shortly after the trip Bantu and Amulya fall in love with each other. Meanwhile, Raj returns from abroad discontinuing his MBA. Ramachandra sends Raj to reject Paidithalli, the son of a wealthy man,'s offer to buy 50% of their company's shares. Ramachandra watches the deal from the hotel where Amulya and Bantu have a meeting with Sudarshan, who wants to buy Amulya's travel agency. Ramachandra is disappointed by Raj's hesitance and inability to say no to Paidithalli but is proud of Bantu and Amulya for saying no to Sudarshan. Following this, Raj is engaged with Amulya on ARK's suggestion, even though Raj was already in love with his cousin Nandu. When Amulya reveals her feelings for Bantu, he convinces her to ask Ramachandra to call-off her marriage with Raj. Paidithalli's father, Appala Naidu, a powerful and influential man, attempts to kill Ramachandra for refusing to sell the shares moments before Amulya and Bantu arrive. Bantu saves Ramachandra by taking him to the hospital where he meets Sulochana, who comes out of her coma and reveals Bantu's true parentage. The furious Bantu slaps Valmiki, telling him that he learned the secret about his birth. Bantu then manages to enter Ramachandra's house, named \\"Vaikuntapuram.\\" ARK is fond of Bantu for saving Ramachandra. Bantu begins to address the issues plaguing the house by patching up Ramachandra's broken relationship with Yasu, settling the dispute with Paidathalli, and reforming the corrupt family members, Kashiram and Sitaram. At a party thrown at their house, Yasu witnesses Bantu and Amulya kissing each other. Bantu is kicked out of the house by Valmiki while Amulya's engagement with Raj is cancelled. Naidu uses the situation to his advantage by kidnapping and threatening to kill Nandu unless Ramachandra gives away the shares to Paidithalli. When Valmiki begs Bantu to save Nandu, he refuses but goes anyway. He thrashes the goons, slams Paidathalli, and stabs Naidu in the chest. Later, Raj saves Naidu, thus ending his enmity with Ramachandra. When Bantu and Valmiki arrive at Vaikuntapuram, ARK slaps Valmiki and reveals that he overheard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. Bantu unites with his biological father, Ramachandra but asks him not to reveal the truth to Yasu, fearing she might be disheartened to know that Raj is not her real child. Unaware of this, Yasu remarks that Bantu is equal to Raj as he saved Nandu and the family, thereby giving Bantu 50% of the company's shares. Yasu then asks Valmiki to train Raj for five years so that he could be as competent as Bantu and become the CEO. After arriving at Valmiki's house, Raj, however, feels that Valmiki with a nurse's help should have switched the babies 25 years ago so he could've ended up at Valmiki's house and Bantu at Ramachandra's, much to the dismay of Valmiki. Meanwhile, Bantu heads to his new office as the CEO with his wife Amulya in a helicopter, also making Valmiki jealous.

The first look poster of the film was released on 1 September 2019. It gives the 'vintage Trivikram mark for its rich appeal and classy look of Bunny'.  Reception  = Critical reception = The film received positive reviews especially for the performance of Allu Arjun, musical score by S. Thaman, and the script and screenplay penned by Trivikram, while the predictable storyline and the narrative of the film were criticised. Hemanth Kumar of Firstpost gave the film 3.25 stars out of 5 and wrote \\"Trivikram Srinivas is a wordsmith of the highest order, and when he's in great form, everything he writes is like music to the ears. He makes you want to latch on to everything that the characters speak or sing throughout the story. However, in Ala Vaikuntapurramlo, he takes a detour from his path and focuses more on the emotional drama between the characters. More than the witty lines and humour, it's the depth in the emotional conversations between the characters that leave a strong impression.\\" A review posted by Rohit Mohan on Koimoi said the film to be \\"a perfect family entertainer to watch on this festive season of [Sankranti] with your near and dear ones, not only for Allu Arjun fans but also for every movie lovers.\\" He gave the film three and a half stars out of five. The Hans India gave the film 3.25 stars out of 5 stating that performances, narration and bgm are the major plus points of the film while also mentioning that there are no major minus points in the movie. Trivikram Srinivas received praise for his script while Allu Arjun was praised for his performance. It was concluded that Ala Vaikunthapurramlo is definitely a worth watching movie. Neeshita Nyayapati of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 stating \\"Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo has a bit of everything and despite the clich√© and the predictable storyline : Trivikram manages to make it work and deliver what he promises. Watch this for Allu Arjun, especially if you're a fan, for he shines in this one and of course, the fun of it all.\\" Karthik Keramalu of The Quint called Ala Vaikunthapurramlo an entertainer that promises fun. According to him \\"Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo has a lot going for it because Bantu (weirdest name for a Telugu movie hero) spends time with other characters (played by Tabu, Jayaram, Sunil, Sachin Khedekar, Vennela Kishore, Rajendra Prasad, Rahul Ramakrishna, Nivetha Pethuraj etc...) and doesn't wallow in mediocrity for a long time. And P. S., Vinod's cinematography makes each frame in the action episodes appear as avant-garde paintings. And on top of it all, the songs are a treat! An absolute treat!\\" Bhavana Sharma of International Business Times called the film a \\"paisa vasool\\" entertainer with amazing performances. She further added \\"Allu Arjun is back with a bang after a gap of two years. Living up to the expectations of the audiences and showing Trivikram's mark everywhere, Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo rings in the celebrations of the Sankranti festival and proves that the film was worth the wait.\\" Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called the film an absorbing and entertaining drama presented by Trivikram ‚Äì Allu Arjun duo. She said the film hits the right notes. = Box office = Ala Vaikunthapurramloo grossed worldwide on its opening day. By the end of first week, the film raked in domestically and also became the first Indian film in 2020 to touch $2 million gross at the United States box office. Ala Vaikunthapurramloo became the first grosser for both Allu Arjun and Trivikram Srinivas. According to Box Office India, the film netted domestically, becoming the sixth film from southern India and the first film without Hindi version to achieve this feat. It has netted more than from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana alone, third film to do so alongside two parts of Baahubali series. By the end of its theatrical run, the film managed to gross worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing Telugu films.

His interest in freshwater insects was first triggered by his interest in fishing. He was also a well-known angler and fly-fisherman and contributed to the works of Frederic M. Halford, a friend and distant relative. Mosely was born in Newcastle upon Tyne to Alfred Isaiah Mosely who came from a well-known Jewish family of dentists. His grandfather, Ephraim Mosely (1807-1873) held practice in Grosvenor Square and was the author of Teeth, their natural history: with the physiology of the human mouth, in regard to artificial teeth (1862). His father died when he was just aged two and was raised by his mother Malvina Marian (n√©e Schlesinger) and her older sister who had moved to live in Hampstead, London. By 1901 the family moved to Kensington and Martin began to work as a bank clerk for a while and took an interest in fishing, possibly through Frederic M. Halford (1844-1914). They fished together at Mottisfont in Hampshire. Mosely joined the Fly Fishers' Club in 1905 where he also joined Hugh G. Franks on fishing trips. Mosely however gave up active fishing around 1912, possibly due to an accident in which he nearly drowned. Mosely was briefly involved with a natural fly committee which was interested in the study of insects. Halford had collected a fair number and he donated his cabinets to the Club and Mosely later described the specimens and added to the collection. Mosely helped edit the journal of the club from 1911 to 1931. Mosely was admitted as a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London in 1910, proposed by Malcolm Burr and seconded by Kenneth J. Morton. Following Halford's death in 1914, he saw the need for a guide to freshwater insects. He began to work on it but was interrupted by World War I. Mosely volunteered with the East Surrey Regiment and then the Royal Fusiliers. After the war, the book plan was hindered by high costs and the lack of an artist to produce the plates. Mosely retired from the bank in 1929 and joined the British Museum as honorary scientist. He also made collection trips to Europe and worked at the museum for the next two decades, examining the Trichoptera collections there. He then collaborated with Douglas E. Kimmins (1905-1985) who illustrated his works (signed just with \\"K\\"). Mosely would later work on the massive collections of Robert McLachlan (1837-1904) which were acquired by the British Museum in 1938. Mosely also collaborated with Norman E. Hickin (1910-1990) to study the immature stages of caddisflies. His outdoor activities were reduced in 1934 following phlebitis which prevented him from standing for long periods. Mosely died a day after suffering from a heart attack in August 1948. He was unmarried and left his estate worth over to his niece Kate Margaret Yates (1910-1991). He donated his collections and manuscripts to the British Museum.  Publications  A selected list of Mosely's works include: * Betten, C. & M.E.

Background In early December 1952 the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Infantry Division occupied defensive positions on the double horseshoe bend of the Imjin River. On the west bank of the river, as it began its first horseshoe turn, lay a low hill complex known as Nori; Big Nori formed the western half of the ridge and Little Nori the eastern half. The ROK 15th Regiment maintained outposts on these hills and also on Hill Betty, about south of Little Nori, and on Hill 105, approximately southwest of Little Nori. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) controlled outposts on the terrain to the north and west of Nori, but had remained fairly inactive in that sector in early December. Battle On 11 December two battalions of the 420th Regiment, 140th Division, 47th Army, closely followed 800 rounds of artillery and mortar fire in an attack upon the ROK outposts on Little Nori, Betty, and Hill 105. The main weight fell on Little Nori as two PVA companies sought to dislodge the men of the ROK 15th Infantry. After a bitter 3-hour exchange at close range, the ROK defenders were ordered to pull back to Hill 69, to the east of Little Nori. After regrouping, the ROK 15th launched two counterattacks, but the two platoons committed failed to drive the PVA off the heights. The PVA waited until the attack forces neared their defensive positions, then hurled hand grenades and loosed a withering artillery, mortar, and small arms fire. Later in the morning, however, a small force from the ROK 11th Regiment, which had relieved the 15th Regiment, reoccupied Little Nori without opposition. In the meantime, the ROK units on Betty had held, but those on Hill 105 had to fall back temporarily. Evidently the PVA movement against Hill 105 was only a diversion, for they left shortly thereafter and the ROK forces reoccupied the positions without incident. On the night of the 11th, the PVA first launched a two-company drive against Little Nori, then increased the attacking force to a battalion, and the ROK again withdrew to Hill 69. Air support was called in and six B-26's dropped over one hundred 260-pound fragmentary bombs on the hill. Twelve battalions of artillery poured a continuous hail of shells on the PVA, but four counterattacks by the ROK 11th Regiment on 12 December failed. Despite the punishment administered by large and small arms and the mounting toll of losses, the PVA held the hill. The artillery concentrations went on during the night of 12-13 December and when morning arrived, a battalion from the ROK 11th Regiment moved in with two companies in the attack. Fighting steadily forward, they won their way back to Little Nori, but met with little success in their efforts to clear Big Nori. On the evening of the 13th, the ROK dug in and awaited the expected PVA counterattacks. Two PVA companies vainly attempted to penetrate the ROK positions during the night and as the morning of 14 December dawned, the contest resolved itself into a stalemate. Aftermath The entire action on Big and Little Nori took place in an area wide and deep. During the engagement the UN artillery fired 120,000 rounds, and the mortar crews over 31,000 while tanks added over 4,500 90mm shells. Supporting aircraft flew 39 missions of 177 sorties to bomb and strafe the PVA positions with Napalm, high explosives, and rockets. In return the ROK received over 18,000 rounds of mixed artillery and mortar fire from PVA guns. The ROK suffered about 750 casualties including 237 dead, while the estimated total for the PVA ranged between 2,290 and 2,732. According to a deserter from the Chinese 420th Regiment in January, the regiment was removed from the line because of the heavy casualties it took in the battle and placed in reserve. Action in the Nori sector settled down to patrols and raids during January 1953. The PVA dispatched two platoon-sized probes during the month and on 23 January the ROK 11th Regiment sent a three-platoon raiding party against Big Nori. Air strikes, artillery, and mortar fire, and fire from twelve supporting tanks enabled the raiders to gain the crest, destroy PVA bunkers and then withdraw safely.

Biography  Gargiani was born in September 1956 in Poggio a Caiano, Italy. He graduated in architecture in 1983 and received his PhD in 1992 at the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Florence. He was successively appointed associate professor of architectural history at the (1994-97), at the √âcole d'Architecture de la Ville et des Territoires Marne-la-Vall√©e (1998-2000), and at the Faculty of Architecture of Roma Tre University (1998-2005), where he was then promoted to full professor. In 2005, he was appointed professor at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), where he is the head of the Laboratory of Theory and History of Architecture 3 (LTH3) and where he served as Director of the Architecture Department (2011-15) and of the Archives de la construction moderne (2015‚Äì2017).  Research  His early research, carried out during the 1980s and 1990s, focused on 20th French century architecture and interiors, on Auguste Perret and his school, and on Le Corbusier. History of construction, from antiquity to the contemporary era, is the subject of books and essays on a wide range of topics, spanning from the construction of the Louvre colonnade in reinforced stone, to the libraries of Henri Labrouste, to the question of polychromy and its implications on the concept of truth of materials, to Gottfried Semper‚Äôs principle of cladding and its influences on techniques in modern architecture. The outcome of the research on the history of construction led to the publication of edited collections of essays dedicated to the essential elements of architecture - column, floor, platform, etc. In the mid-1990s he also focused his research on techniques, materials and structures of European Renaissance architecture, which resulted in a book on Italian architecture of the 15th century. In the early 2000s his research on contemporary architecture, in particular on Rem Koolhaas, Archizoom Associati and Superstudio, resulted in several monographic essays and an exposition. In 2008, he was awarded with the ERC Advanced Grant for a research entitled \\"The surfaces of cement and reinforced concrete. A history of formwork and processing of the surface, 1870-2008\\". In his collection Treatise on Concrete, curated by EPFL Press, Roberto Gargiani investigated on the protagonists of 20th century concrete architecture (Le Corbusier, Louis I. Kahn and Pier Luigi Nervi), explored crucial historical periods for the development of concrete structures (18th century), and tackled the role of this material in 20th century art.

Biography The tower of the episcopal castle of Gy≈ër, built by Bishop Artolf Artolf (or Artolph) was born into an unidentified wealthy Hungarian noble family, which possessed large-scale landholdings in Transdanubia. The Schematizmus dioecesis Jauriensis refers to him as Artolf and Aistulf, simultaneously, while other documents also mention the name variants of Arnolphus and Atolf. Artolf was an educated prelate and skilled in theology and science. He was styled as provost of V√°c in 1237. Artolf was appointed Bishop of Transylvania around June 1244 by B√©la IV of Hungary, who filled the dignity after a three-year period vacancy, which lasted from the death of Raynald of Belleville, who was killed in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241. During their invasion, the Mongols completely devastated and perished the province of Transylvania, along with its diocese and church property (including the cathedral). Artolf's task was to begin the restoration of the diocese's administrative and financial positions, but the lack of local knowledge and the shocking experience of the destruction exceeded his suitability. Around September 1245, the cathedral chapter of Gy≈ër elected Artolf as their bishop. Leaving the remote and war-torn Transylvania, he pleased to occupy the position, as the several lands of his family laid in the territory of the diocese. King B√©la IV interceded Pope Innocent IV in order to transfer Artolf from Transylvania to Gy≈ër. The monarch called his protege as \\"popular, clean-lived, educated and principled\\", while argued, \\"the army of his powerful and influential kinship will be useful for the Crown against the hostile raids at the western boundaries of the kingdom\\". The remark obviously referred to the emerging tension between B√©la IV and Frederick the Quarrelsome, Duke of Austria. The pope contributed to the change and translated Artolf to the Diocese of Gy≈ër on 12 December 1245. Artolf's bishopric became a buffer zone between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Duchy of Austria in the upcoming years. He was responsible for to protect the frontier in Western Hungary. It is presumable that Artolf built the tower of the episcopal castle of Gy≈ër. Artolf was last mentioned as a living person by contemporary records in November 1251. He died in 1252.

Personal life and family  Her great grandfather was the renowned Kabbalist Rabbi Yehuda Fatiyah. Her grandfather, Shaul Fatiyah was also a Kabbalist. His daughter, Pedaya's mother, Simha Ovadia Fatiyah, established the \\"Hazon\\" project, which provided vocational rehabilitation for people with mental illness. He owned a shop in the Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem. Her parents immigrated to Israel from Baghdad, during the 1950s, during the mass migration of Jews from Iraq. Pedaya was born and grew up in Jerusalem. Pedaya is married to David Sorotzkin, has one daughter, and lives in Beersheba. Her interest in Jewish mysticism and spirituality began on a personal level before it became her area of research. She believes in reincarnation, a belief she \\"inherited\\" from her Kabbalist grandfather, and between the ages of 17 and 22, she undertook a ta'anit (ritual of abstention) of silence. She defines herself as \\"religious by choice, not conditioning\\", and cares for all the street and yard cats and dogs in her neighborhood. According to Pedaya, \\"the condition of animals is a mirror of the human condition\\". After making her career in research of mysticism and Jewish history, she turned to writing prose and poetry. Her first prose book, Ein HeHatul (Eye of the Cat) includes stories of the animals she cares for. As a Mizrahi feminist, she has collaborated with various Mizrahi cultural events and organizations, and is a fierce critic of the ways society continues to oppress women. = Academic career = Pedaya studied Kabbalah and Jewish philosophy at the Hebrew University. She graduated from the School of Visual Theater in 1991. She continued on to complete her PhD in Jewish Philosophy. Her dissertation was the basis for her book about Rabbi Yitzhak Sagi Nahor, \\"◊î◊©◊ù ◊ï◊î◊û◊ß◊ì◊© ◊ë◊û◊©◊†◊™ ◊®' ◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ß ◊°◊í◊ô ◊†◊î◊ï◊®\\", published in 2001. In 1987, Pedaya was appointed as a lecturer in the history department at Ben-Gurion University, and became a full professor in 2002. Since 2009, she is the head the Elyachar Center for Studies in Sephardi Heritage. Pedaya stood at the helm of the Helicon School of Poetry (2014‚Äì2105), and served as an academic adviser at Alma College, where she also taught. She was a board member of the Chaim Herzog Center for Middle East Studies (2006‚Äì2007), and is a senior fellow at the Van Leer Institute, where she led two research groups ‚Äì Piyyut, and The East Writes Itself. Pedaya is on the editorial board of the peer-reviewed Bezalel Journal of Visual and Material Culture. She is the recipient of the National Academy of Sciences Gershom Scholem award for Kabbalistic studies for 2018, the Yehuda Amichai literary award of 2012, and the President's Literature Award of 2004, for her book \\"Motzah Hanefesh\\".

She is particularly interested in the phenomenology of the Kabbalah, which is where she began her research into ecstasy. She later began researching the Hassidic movement of the 18th century, and Rabbi Nachman of Breslev. In her book \\"Hashem veHamikdash\\" she deals with the concepts of heavenly Jerusalem, the apocalypse, and the Kabbalah. In her two books about Nachmanides, she discusses hermeneutics, the land of Israel, symmetry, and the applicability of layers of exegesis to layers of reality; the relationship between the symbolic and the concrete, and how it applies to categorization of texts, and attitudes towards the Jewish diaspora.Name and Sanctuary in the Teaching of R. Isaac the Blind, Magnes, August 2001 Her Hassidic research tends to concentrate on mysticism, a subject she expanded upon in her book Vision and Speech (\\"Hamar'eh veHadibur\\"), in which she employs typology to describe the mystical. One of the ideas that sets Pedaya apart from other researchers of Hassidism is the argument that it is one of the major expressions of Jewish modernism, as opposed to other scholars who believe that enlightenment is the best expression of Jewish modernism, while Hassidism is archaic and undeveloped.Vision and Speech: Models of Revelatory Experience in Jewish Mysticism, Los Angeles: Kruv, 2002 Another major subject of study for Pedaya is the concept of trauma in Judaism. She sees Jewish history as traumatic, and thus, she approaches her work as dealing with the theology of crisis. She considers the Spanish expulsion of the Jews as one of most major traumas of Jewish history. Pedaya was the first person to apply the ideas of trauma and inter-generational transference to 16th century Jewish history ‚Äì tools more generally applied to Holocaust research.  Literary works  = Prose = Her first prose work is Ein HeHatul (Eye of the Cat), published in 2008. It is a collection of stories about urban characters, interspersed with a study of the cat as a wanderer in the urban space. Her next work was Hotamot (seals), a collection of short stories influenced by folk tales. Some of the stories are realistic, while others allegorical and fantastical. Most of the book deals with the feminine existence: The girl-youth-woman in relationships and family settings, where a minor character in one story is the main character of another. Both books include Kabbalistic influences in both narrative and structure. = Poetry = When Pedaya won the President's literary award, the announcement included as a reason: \\"A masterpiece of lyrical poetry ... In multi-vocal and multi-layered language she is a trailblazer of Hebrew poetry.\\" MiTeivah Stuma (From a Cryptic Ark, 1996) is a collection of symbolic poems, many of which were later set to music by contemporary Israeli artists of multiple genres.  Music  According to Noam Ben Zeev, Haaretz critic: \\"At the basis of the rich consciousness of Pedaya is music, having crossed the border between the music of her home and her private world, and presenting her music to the public about a decade ago. It was a dramatic move that created a stylistic change in Hebrew music, and there are those who define it as a revolution.\\" In 2003 Pedaya established the \\"Yonah Ensemble\\" (dove ensemble), to create a renaissance of mystical and liturgical music from the Near East. The ensemble was active until 2010, with Pedaya as its manager and musical producer. The lead singer of the ensemble was the Hazzan Yehuda Ovadia Pedaya, Haviva Pedaya's brother. The ensemble was invited to perform at the Krakow Jewish Music Festival. Pedaya was co-founder and producer of the musical show called \\"Yehuda Halevy Corner of Ibn Gbirol\\" ‚Äì references to two main streets in Tel Aviv named after Yehuda Halevy, the Spanish Jewish physician, poet and philosopher; and Shlomo Ibn Gbirol, the 11th-century Andalusian poet and Jewish philosopher. The event, which took place at Heichal HaTarbut in 2004, featured performances by some of Israel's leading musicians, including Hava Alberstein, Kobi Oz, Eviatar Banai, Berry Sakharof, Ahuva Ozeri, Mosh Ben Ari, Ehud Banai, Shem Tov Levy, David D'Or, Yonatan Razel, Yonah ensemble, and others. The performance was released on CD as a live album. Pedaya initiated and produced the album \\"Najarah\\" in 2013. The album included piyyut music of the Baghdad Kabbalists, with Turkish Sufi stylings, based on words by the 16th century Jewish poet Yisrael Najarah. She collaborated on several additional projects with musicians of varying modern styles: Berry Sakharof (rock), Aviv Gedj (fusion of rock, Mizrahi, and piyyut), and Dikla (singer-songwriter, fusion of Arabic music and pop). In 2015, Pedaya staged \\"Hillula for a Mother ‚Äì an Oriental Rock Opera\\", a requiem to her own late mother. The musical was performed at the Israel Festival. Pedaya wrote the words, and Peretz Eliyahu set them to music. The musical style of the composition is classical Arabic with oriental rock. In 2013, Pedaya edited the book Piyyut as a Cultural Prism (Hapiyut Ketsohar tarbuti), which included a chapter by her entitled \\"Piyyut as a Dream and as a Window: Spaces of Memory\\", in which she analyzed the essence of piyyut. In 2017, the annual festival of Ethiopian music in Jerusalem, Hullegeb Festival, featured the event The Return to Zion: Longings for the Heavenly Israel (‚ÄúShivat Zion‚Äù in Hebrew), a multi-layered, multi-style show based on Pedaya's work, in which participated Ethiopian-born and Russian-born singers and musicians, in styles ranging from the liturgical, to electronic, to jazz. Pedaya, who has written extensively about the Sephardic/Mizrahi immigration experisnce in Israel, sought to create inclusivity for a group facing not only issues of immigration, but also color-based racism: \\"‚ÄúJudaism comprises all the diasporas, all the colors, all the music ‚Äì all the scales and maqams ‚Äì that they have in Eastern and Western music. And there are also Jews who are black, which I feel is wonderful.\\"  Public works  Pedaya is the creator of the \\"Zman Yehudi Maleh\\" (full Jewish time), an online encyclopedia of Jews from Islamic nations. Between 2007 and 2011 Pedaya was chair of the non-profit organization \\"Reshimu\\" for a spiritual material environment, and chair of the non-profit \\"Hazon Fetiyah\\", the association created by her mother to provide occupational rehabilitation for mentally ill people. She was also active in the \\"Amcha\\" association, an assistance organization for Holocaust survivors, and was an advisor for the Haifa biennale. In 2013, Pedaya ran for the city council elections in Beersheba, on the Meretz ticket, but was not elected. In 2013‚Äì2014 was a co-founder of I-Core Center of Excellence, a cooperative venture between Hebrew University and Ben-Gurion University. She is responsible for two musical projects at the center: \\"Jewish Identity, Place and Absence\\", dealing with Hassidic music from Poland; and \\"Southern Eastern\\", Mizrahi Hazzanic music in southern Israel. Pedaya is a member of the Hermes International Forum, which promotes world peace, and meets annually in Marrakesh, Morocco. The Forum works to process theological messages into spiritual and universal language of tolerance and acceptance. Since 2016, Pedaya is chairperson of the Council of Public Libraries in Israel. That same year, she was appointed to the national council of higher education. She is also on the Advisory board of the Shaharit think tank, leadership incubator, and community organizing hub. In addition, she heads Makom M‚ÄôShelach (\\"A Place of Your Own\\"), a project of empowerment and rehabilitation through the arts for women with mental illness from all sectors of society.  Other writing and commentary  Pedaya is a prolific writer of art criticism, opinion journalism, and social analysis, in particular about Mizrahi issues. For example, her essay \\"The City as Text and the Margins as Voice ‚Äì Exclusion from the Book and Routing to the Book\\" explores musical culture as a mirror of Ashkenazi and Mizrahi society in Israel. She describes the dialectic between the geographical periphery, where she says the authentic voice and memory are held, and the center, where she says singers from the periphery flock to, seeking acceptance, but losing their true voices en route. Most of her early works on music and poetry form a manifesto on the topic of Mizrahi culture; her article \\"The Exiled Voice\\", which appeared in Haaretz in 2004, describes the ways that repressed memories are recovered by third-generation Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Israelis, as expressed in music. Pedaya also writes about art, primarily Mizrahi art.\\"◊î◊î◊ï◊§◊¢◊î ◊ï◊î◊î◊™◊í◊ú◊ï◊™\\", ◊ë◊™◊ï◊ö: ◊û◊®◊ô◊™ ◊ë◊ü ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú (◊¢◊ï◊®◊õ◊™), ◊ß◊ï◊ú◊î ◊©◊ú ◊î◊û◊ú◊î, ◊î◊ñ◊ô◊®◊î ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ü-◊™◊ó◊ï◊û◊ô◊™, ◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë: ◊ë◊ë◊ú, 2003; ◊ß◊ò◊ú◊ï◊í ◊î◊™◊¢◊®◊ï◊õ◊î ◊©◊ú ◊©◊ú◊û◊î ◊ë◊®◊ï◊©, 2009.; \\"◊û◊ï◊ú◊ì◊™ ◊î◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ô◊ê ◊î◊ô◊ú◊ì◊ï◊™\\" ‚Äì ◊ß◊ò◊ú◊ï◊í ◊î◊™◊¢◊®◊ï◊õ◊î ◊©◊ú ◊ê◊û◊ô◊® ◊†◊ï◊ï◊î, 2010; \\"◊™◊õ◊ï◊ú◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊™\\", ◊ß◊ò◊ú◊ï◊í ◊î◊ë◊ô◊†◊ê◊ú◊î ◊î◊ô◊ù-◊™◊ô◊õ◊ï◊†◊ô◊™ ◊©◊ú ◊ó◊ô◊§◊î, 2010, ◊¢◊û' 14‚Äì21. ◊§◊ì◊ô◊î, ◊ó◊ë◊ô◊ë◊î; ◊§◊ì◊ô◊î, ◊ó◊ë◊ô◊ë◊î, \\"◊ê◊ô◊¶◊ô◊ß ◊ë◊ì◊©, ◊î◊õ◊î◊ü ◊ë◊©◊ù ◊î◊ê◊ù\\", ◊ë◊™◊ï◊ö: \\"◊ñ◊ê◊ú◊î\\", ◊û◊ï◊ñ◊ô◊ê◊ï◊ü ◊§◊™◊ó ◊™◊ß◊ï◊ï◊î ◊ú◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊™, 2010, ◊¢◊û' 27‚Äì39.

The film features Bellamkonda Sreenivas and Anupama Parameswaran in the lead roles and it is the official remake of the 2018 Tamil film Ratsasan. The music is composed by Ghibran, the film began production in March 2019. Movie was released on 2 August 2019. Plot The film opens with two elderly men discovering the corpse of Samyuktha, a 15-year-old school student who was found brutally murdered and wrapped in a polythene bag. Arun Kumar (Bellamkonda Sreenivas) is an aspiring filmmaker who wants to make a movie on psychopaths. After being rejected many times despite having a good script and due to pressure from his family, he decides to give up his dreams and become a sub-inspector with the help of his brother-in-law, Prasad (Rajeev Kanakala), a police officer himself. He moves in with his sister Sapna (Vinodhini Vaidyanathan), Prasad, and their daughter Siri (Abhirami). Siri gets into trouble when she makes Arun forge her father's signature on her report card as she failed in two subjects. Her class teacher Krishnaveni (Anupama Parameswaran) figures this out and thinks that she signed it herself. Siri brings Arun to her school to pretend to be her father. Later, when Siri is caught by her parents, they transfer their daughter to another school. Arun then meets and befriends Krishnaveni and her niece Kavya (Dua Kaushik), who is speech deprived. A teenage school girl named Amrutha is abducted on her way home. Her parents then find a mutilated doll's head in a gift box attached to their dog's collar. Arun finds a similarity between Samyuktha and Amrutha, both of them being 15-year-old school students who were kidnapped while returning from school. Just like Samyuktha, the hair on the doll's forehead is uprooted, the eyes are drilled, and her mouth is damaged. Apart from that, in particular, there is a knife mark on Samyuktha's forehead, ears and nasion. The same marks were found on the doll's face. He tries to convince ACP Lakshmi (Suzane George), his egotistical superior officer, that this was a psychopath at work. However, his theories are brushed off as stories. Later, Amrutha's brutally mutilated corpse is found. The killer drilled out Amrutha's eyes, broke her teeth, and uprooted her hair in patches. On top of that, Amrutha's body has stab wounds made while she was alive. Arun suggests the corpses be hidden from the public to prevent the killer from gaining attention. Initially, the officials oppose this idea owing to breaking protocol, but they eventually give in, moving the bodies to a secret facility under Dr. Kishore (Surya). Soon after, another school girl named Meera (Priya) is abducted. She happened to be from Siri's former school. The search leads to a teacher named Somaraj (Vinod Sagar), who works at Siri's current school and is revealed to be a pedophile preying on schoolgirls. Arun encounters Somaraj trying to molest Siri and beats him up before detaining him. Somaraj admits to being a sexual predator but denies having anything to do with the murders. In a bid to escape, he holds Venkat (Keshav Deepak), a policeman, at gunpoint. Arun manages to gun Somaraj down inside the lift, thereby saving Venkat. Meanwhile, Siri is abducted from her birthday party at home. Arun and Prasad try to find her but they were too late. Arun discovers her mutilated body in their car trunk, implying that she was also murdered. Things worsen for Arun, as he gets suspended for his negligence for shooting Somaraj. Dejected and angry, Arun investigates the case by himself, with the help of a few policemen. Finding an audio clip from the hearing aid of Meera, he traces it back to an elderly magician named Annabella George's (Saravanan) performance at the victim's school function. The lady used her magic show as a ruse to kidnap the girls since she impressed all the students with her magic tricks. She invites one student to volunteer in an act and then interacts with the student to gain her trust. She stalks the selected student leading to their kidnapping the day after meeting them, without any hassle. This leads Arun to the next potential victim, a schoolgirl named Sanjana (Trishala). Arun soon realises that he was following the wrong girl when he learns of Sanjana having a twin sister. Sanjana gets abducted, even though she was under surveillance. Arun tracks her location to a house in the city, where he narrowly saves Sanjana from being murdered. The perpetrator escapes, but her identity is revealed to be Mary Fernandez (her real name), who was involved in a killing a long time ago. Arun finds more about the case from the investigating officer, Jaya Prakash, (Radha Ravi), a retired cop. Mary's son Christopher (Yasar) had been afflicted with Werner Syndrome, a hormonal disorder that caused him to look aged. He was an outcast at school, but a girl named Sophie (Ragavi Renu) took pity on him and befriended him. Christopher soon began to develop feelings for Sophie, but unfortunately, he is heartbroken when she turns down his love and is ridiculed at school. The next day, Mary asked Sophie to become friends again and handed her a gift. When Sophie opens the gift box, she found a mutilated doll's head, which was what Sophie gave Christopher as his birthday gift. Sophie was brutally murdered by Mary, and both Mary and her son were arrested. It is then revealed that both Mary and Christopher were in an accident, and she is still alive and murdering with the same vengeance. Jaya Prakash finds a clue in the files but is killed by Mary before meeting Arun. On being found at the scene of the crime, Arun is detained and kept handcuffed at the station. He discovers that Jaya Prakash was trying to reveal that the person who had been performing the magic show in the school had six fingers on the left hand and by a piece of photo evidence, it is known that it was Christopher who has six fingers. Since only Mary died in the accident, the murderer is not the lady - it is her son Christopher, who has taken advantage of his aged appearance. Before Arun can act on this, Christopher attacks Krishnaveni and abducts Kavya. While trying to apprehend Christopher, Venkat is killed. Kavya escapes and is found by Kishore, who tries to hide her in the facility, but Kishore dies trying to protect her. Arun tracks down Christopher to the facility, and after a prolonged fight, manages to kill him and save Kavya. The movie ends with the media reporting the chain of events and an end to the murders by the psychopath. It is then revealed that Arun gets a chance to make a movie about a psychopath, fulfilling his dream.

Bellamkonda puts in one of his best performances till date\\". Firstpost gave 3.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"The biggest strength of Rakshasudu lies in its staging and how well-knit the whole narrative is. Editing by Amar Reddy is another major asset and there is hardly a boring moment in the film. For Sreenivas, film is a major shot in the arm and huge improvement compared to his recent performances\\". India Today gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Bellamkonda Sai Sreenivas's Rakshasudu is a frame-to-frame remake of Tamil film Ratsasan. While the cop-thriller shows lazy film-making in parts, it still keeps you engrossed in the proceedings. Ghibran's haunting score, which speaks volumes\\". Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Plus points are performances, story and screenplay. On the flipside, there is a bit of Tamil flavour (lacking Telugu nativity) in casting some of the actors and in some of the scenes. The dark approach of describing gruesome nature and killing techniques is not recommended for everybody\\". Great Andhra gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Rakshasudu is Sreenivas's better act among all his movies. Musical background score by Ghibran and the sound design have actually elevated the movie. The sound is terrific. Production values are perfect\\". Sify gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Rakshasudu is a fairly captivating serial- killer thriller with some edge of the seat moments.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The building was demolished in 2016. History In 1917, work began on construction of Fort Custer, for use as a training center for troops drafted to fight in World War I. In 1918, on land directly adjacent to Fort Custer, construction began on the Roosevelt Community House, intended to serve as an officer's club and a hospitality station for family members of the men stationed at Fort Custer. The building was financed by the state of Michigan War Emergency Fund. However, the building was not completely finished until late 1918, after Armistice had been declared. The building was dedicated on January 6, 1919, and named after Theodore Roosevelt, who had died earlier that same day. As the use of Fort Custer wound down, the Roosevelt Community House served as a hospitality station for only a few months. After the war, the building was purchased by Bernarr Macfadden, a popular proponent of physical culture, as a home for his International Health Resort. However, at the same time there was a rising tide of returning servicemen who had contracted tuberculosis; recognizing the public health crisis, governor Alex Groesbeck purchased the Roosevelt Community House back from Macfadden in 1921. The state then leased it to the American Legion for use as a veteran's hospital, particularly for the care of tuberculosis. Over the years, new buildings were added, and as tuberculosis declined and the Veterans Health Administration began building hospitals, the Roosevelt American Legion Hospital began diversifying, admitting non-veterans and treating other diseases. By 1951, half of the patients were non-veterans. In the early 1950s, major additions were made to the hospital, and many of the older wooden buildings on the campus, some of which had been moved from Fort Custer after World War I, were razed. The hospital also began to specialize in rehabilitation services, and in 1965 changed its name to the Southwest Regional Rehabilitation Center. It served as a rehabilitation center until 1973, when the hospital moved and the building was repurposed to be a long- term housing and health care facility for veterans, known as the Legion Villa. However, the condition of the building gradually deteriorated, and in 2013, after failed attempts to secure funding for repairs, the facility closed. The property was condemned and the city of Springfield took ownership in 2014. The building was demolished in 2016. Description The Roosevelt Community House was a T-shaped, wood-framed Arts and Crafts building. The building had a distinctive, large, three-story open rotunda with a gable roof placed at the intersection of the T. The wings extending outward from the rotunda were 1-1/2 stories tall with gable roofs. The gable roofs contained four dormers on each slope, and porches extended around the building. The siding was originally cedar, but was covered with aluminum in the 1950s. The large rotunda had massive wooden trusses supporting the roof and banks if high windows.

As a soloist she is also remembered as Swanhilda in Copp√©lia, a role she performed 128 times to wide acclaim. She became the company's star ballerina until her retirement in 1918. Biography Born on 19 November 1872, Valborg Bodil Emilie J√∏rgensen was the daughter of J√∏rgen Adolf J√∏rgensen (1822‚Äì1900), an instrument maker, and Christiane Pouline Engelund (1835‚Äì1890). She married twice, first in 1896 with the actor Johannes Norden Guldbrandsen (1871‚Äì1922), then in 1908 with the actor and later theatre director Kaare Guldbrand Borchsenius (1874‚Äì1960). Valborg J√∏rgensen attended the ballet school of the Royal Danish Theatre from 1879. As a child, she appeared in the first performances of Ibsen's A Doll's House at the Royal Theatre. After her ballet d√©but in 1888 as the eskimo girl in Bournonville's Far from Denmark, in 1891 she danced the title role in his La Sylphide, marking her development as a soloist. She went on to take the leading roles in Bournonville's repertoire, often partnering Hans Beck. She played Astrid in Valdemar, Hilda in Et Folkesagn, Sigyn in Thrymskviden, Ragnhild and Kirsti in Brudef√¶rden i Hardanger, Svava in Valkyrien and Celeste in Toreadoren. In June 1918, she retired as a dancer, performing two of her most successful roles: Swinilda in Copp√©lia and Teresina in Napoli. She continued as a teacher at the theatre's ballet school, ensuring that the children were brought up in the true Bournonville style in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. One of her lasting achievements was that she described in writing the choreographic details of Bournonville's ballets, ensuring that later generations would be able to draw on an authentic record.

They finished the season 9‚Äì19, 2‚Äì16 in SEC play. They lost to Ole Miss in the first round of the SEC Tournament. The Tigers' season was beset with many problems. Junior forward John Caylor, expected to be a key contributor this season, was lost after five games due to a life-threatening blood clot in his shoulder. Junior guard Derrick Dennison, another key contributor from last season, quit the team over a feud with Coach Smith about a reduced role, but later returned. Additionally, forward Kelvin Ardister, a junior-college transfer, and freshman guard Johnny Benjamin were both dismissed from the team after seven games for violating team rules. Prior to his dismissal, Benjamin had been arrested and imprisoned on two misdemeanor charges, criminal trespassing and third-degree theft of property, when he entered a student's off-campus apartment and took an undisclosed amount of money. After the season, coach Sonny Smith resigned and took the head coaching position at VCU.

He played for Canterbury-Bankstown and for Western Suburbs in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. Playing career Allison made his first grade debut for Wests against Balmain in Round 6 1935 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Western Suburbs would go on to reach the finals in 1935 but were defeated by Eastern Suburbs. Allison played one further season with Wests before leaving at the end of 1936. Due to the residency rules at the time, Allison missed 2 years of playing before signing with Canterbury in 1939. Allison scored a try on debut for the club against Eastern Suburbs and was a member of their City Cup winning team. In 1940, Canterbury reached their second grand final against Eastern Suburbs. Allison played at second-row as Canterbury were defeated 24-14 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The following season, Canterbury finished 2nd in 1941 and reached the final but were once again defeated by Easts 24-22. In 1942, Allison only made 2 appearances for Canterbury and missed out on the club's second premiership victory over St George. In the following 2 seasons, Canterbury went from winning the premiership in 1942 to running last in 1943 and 1944 claiming the wooden spoon. As of the 2019 season, no other club has gone from premiers to wooden spooners the next season with the exception of Melbourne who won the premiership in 2009 but were later stripped of the title for major breaches of the salary cap in 2010 and made to play for no points which resulted in the club coming last. Allison played up with Canterbury up until the end of 1945 before retiring. His last game for the club was the reserve grade grand final against South Sydney. In total, Allison played 105 games for Canterbury across all grades.

Demolition of the ruins was complicated by solidified lead that bound the ruins together. * List of churches destroyed in the Great Fire of London and not rebuilt Many London churches were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. * Newcastle Cathedral A Norman predecessor burned in 1216. * Norwich Cathedral In 1171 a fire damaged the nave. A lightning strike in 1463 ignited the spire and destroyed the nave roof. The heat of the fire changed the limestone of the nave from cream colored to pink in places. In 1509 the transept roofs burned. * Peterborough Cathedral A 22 November 2001, arson caused substantial damage to the cathedral where the wooden ceiling came within moments of catching fire. Fortunately the fire was spotted by one of the vergers allowing a swift response by emergency services. The timing was particularly unfortunate, for a complete restoration of the painted wooden ceiling was nearing completion. * Sheffield Cathedral The parish church predecessor was burned in 1266. * Southwark Cathedral The cathedral's predecessor was destroyed in 1212 by the Great Fire of Southwark. * Southwell Cathedral Lightning striking the southwest tower burned the tower roof, nave and crossing on 5 November 1711.

Its successor was damaged in 1069 during the harrying of the North, and finally destroyed by the Danes in 1070. A new Norman style structure was built from 1080 and was damaged by fire in 1137. It was replaced in stages by the present structure. An 1840 fire destroyed the roof over the nave, southwest tower and south aisle. On 9 July 1984 a major fire destroyed the roof and vaulted ceiling of the 13th-century south transept.

His father, Urban Richard P√ºschel, the village pastor, had studied at Leipzig University but was from a working-class background of miners, foresters, and farmers. P√ºschel had four brothers; Gottfried, Martin, Walter, and Georg. The three elder brothers served in World War I; Martin was killed in October 1914, aged 20. Walter, who was severely injured in the war, died in 1920.P√ºschel, Konrad (1997) Wege eines Bauh√§uslers. Dessau: Anhaltische Verlagsgesellschaft mbH The family finances were badly affected by hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, so at 16 P√ºschel began an apprenticeship with a master carpenter in a firm in Glauchau in May 1923, which he completed in April 1926. There he learned a wide range of woodworking, furniture-making, and building skills, including reading the detailed architectural plans and drawings from which he had to work. As a young man in 1920s Weimar Republic Germany, P√ºschel began to socialise with young artists and became interested in Modernism. His friends often discussed the Bauhaus and its teaching methods, and he decided to apply to study there. Bauhaus Dessau One of the Laubengangh√§user apartment blocks, from the garden side, built 1930 P√ºschel began his studies at the Bauhaus in Dessau on 1 November 1926, enabling him to be present for the official opening of the Bauhaus Dessau building on 4 December 1926. He first took Josef Albers' preliminary course, as all students did. He was also taught painting by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky and photography by Laszlo Moholy- Nagy, and he participated in Oskar Schlemmer's stage workshop. He spent his second semester at the Bauhaus, starting in April 1927, studying under Marcel Breuer in the wood sculpture workshop. In 1928 he undertook a building apprenticeship at the school, and in March 1929 he began studying architecture in the Building Department under Hannes Meyer, the director of the Bauhaus. Between 1929 and 1930, as part of his training under Meyer, he worked on the Laubengangh√§user apartments in Dessau, a social housing project, along with fellow students , , Hans Volger, , and others, covering all aspects of running a large building project including design, construction management and project accounting.Bauhaus100.

From 1934 he worked in the industrial city of Orsk, in the southern Urals, working on the Sotsgorod Orsk project, building housing, sports halls, kindergartens, schools and college buildings. International political tensions in the mid-1930s and Stalinism becoming wary of foreigners made Meyer return to Switzerland in 1936. P√ºschel returned to Germany in May 1937. Three of the other members of the Red Bauhaus Brigade were arrested by the Soviet authorities in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

Nazi era Immediately upon returning to Glauchau, P√ºschel was interrogated for two days by the Gestapo in the basement of the town hall, and his relatives were also questioned. As he was not a member of any left-wing political party, he was let go with the understanding that he would be under the watch of the Nazis. He was not allowed to work for any government agency and so he began a blacksmith's apprenticeship in his father-in-law's foundry and thus obtained work with a building firm in the area around Merseburg, mainly by leading apartment building projects. However, under pressure from local Nazis, the firm dismissed him. He and his wife were also evicted from their flat. He was then employed by the architect Alfred Arndt, a former student and teacher at the Bauhaus, in Probstzella, Th√ºringia, where his daughter Monika was born in 1938. In 1939, while he was working for Arndt, he designed the home and weaving workshop of the Bauhaus-trained weaver Margaretha Reichardt in Erfurt.

Early life and education Akothee was born Esther Akoth on 8 April 1980 in Migori County as the first daughter of her parents. She grew up in Migori, where she attended school. Akothee attended Nyabisawa Girls secondary school but dropped out one year later in form two (sophomore) before completing her high school program when she eloped with her boyfriend who was also in high school at the time and entered early marriage. After running away from home, her boyfriend went back to school and she was forced to start with her mother in law, for whom she worked as a house help for seven years. It was while at her mother-in-law's home in Migori that she conceived and bore her first child. She was fourteen years old at the time. She gave birth to her second and third children at ages fifteen and sixteen respectively. However her second child, a daughter, died in infancy following an illness because she could not raise the money needed for her treatment. In 2000, she gave birth to her fourth child, at seventeen years of age. The same year, Akothee and her mother-in-law disagreed, and she left her in-law's home to fend for herself. As result of their disagreement, Akothee moved to Kanga, where she worked as a fish hawker to raise money for upkeep. Meanwhile, her husband continued with his studies, and by this time, he was in the university. In 2003, he completed his university education and the two moved in together, at which point the two decided that Akothee would go back to school while her husband took care of the kids. She went back to high school and, in 2004, at 21 years of age, completed her high school education at Gachie Mixed Secondary, finishing with a mean grade of C+.

He was most notable for being the father of President Martin Van Buren. Biography Abraham Van Buren was born in Albany, New York on February 17, 1737, the son of Marten Pieterse Van Buren (1701‚Äì1766) and Dirckje (Van Alstyne) Van Buren. The fifth of nine children, he was a descendant of Cornelis Maessen, a native of Buurmalsen, Netherlands who had come to North America in 1631. Van Buren owned a Kinderhook farm and several slaves, as well as a combined tavern and inn. Most of Kinderhook's residents were descendants of the Dutch colonists who created New Netherland, and they spoke Dutch as their primary language. The Van Buren tavern was strategically situated on the main route between New York City and Albany. In addition to being a prominent destination for stagecoach travelers, Van Buren's tavern was also a prominent local meeting place, and used for political gatherings, town meetings, and as a polling place. During the American Revolution, Van Buren was identified with the Patriot cause, and he served in the Albany County Militia's 7th Regiment with the rank of captain. After the war, Van Buren was active in politics as an Anti-Federalist and Jeffersonian, and he joined the Democratic-Republican Party at its founding. In 1787, Van Buren was elected to serve as Kinderhook's town clerk, the first individual chosen for this position after it was created. He served until 1797, and was succeeded by his stepson James I. Van Alen. The details of Abraham Van Buren's education are not known, but according to 1914's A History of Old Kinderhook, his excellent penmanship and the legibility of the town records he produced was still notable more than 120 years after he created them. Family From his wife's first marriage to Johannes Van Alen, Van Buren was the stepfather of: * Marytje (or Maria) Van Alen (1768‚Äì1829), who married John L. Hoes. * John I. Van Alen (1770‚Äì1805) * James I. Van Alen (1772‚Äì1822), who practiced law with Martin Van Buren, succeeded Abraham Van Buren as town clerk, and also served as a member of Congress (1807‚Äì1809). From his own marriage, Van Buren's children included:. * Dirckie \\"Derike\\" Van Buren (1777‚Äì1865), who married Barent Hoes (1777‚Äì1853). Barent Hoes was the brother of Martin Van Buren's wife, and served in local offices including town clerk. * Jannetje (Called \\"Hannah\\" or \\"Jane\\") Van Buren (1780‚Äì1838), who never married and who resided with her sister Dirckie Van Buren and brother-in-law Barent Hoes. * Martin Van Buren (1782‚Äì1862), 8th President of the United States. * Lawrence (or Laurence) Van Buren (1786‚Äì1868), a store owner and attorney who served as a militia officer in the War of 1812 and held local offices including Kinderhook Town Supervisor, postmaster, and presidential elector in 1852. * Abraham Van Buren (1788‚Äì1836), an attorney who served as Columbia County Surrogate after Martin Van Buren and James I. Van Alen. Death and burial Van Buren died in Kinderhook on April 8, 1817. He was buried at Kinderhook Reformed Church Cemetery. Reputation Martin Van Buren apparently said and wrote very little about his father. In one of his few recorded recollections, Martin Van Buren wrote of his father that Abraham Van Buren was an amiable man who had no enemies, but also had little talent for making or saving money. However, Abraham Van Buren's children also erected a marker over his grave, which contained a detailed epitaph: References  External links  * 1737 births 1817 deaths American people of Dutch descent Burials in New York (state) Fathers of Presidents of the United States Fathers of Vice Presidents of the United States Fathers of Secretaries of State of the United States Martin Van Buren New York (state) Anti- Federalists New York (state) Democratic-Republicans New York (state) militiamen in the American Revolution People from Kinderhook, New York Abraham 1737 ","title":"Abraham Van Buren (I)"},{"id":"60509518","text":"Farkas from the kindred Bejc (; died after 1269) was a Hungarian prelate in the 13th century, who served as Bishop of Gy≈ër from 1268 to 1269. Prior to that, he was provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and vice-chancellor in the royal court, then briefly elected Bishop of Zagreb. Biography Also referred to as Wolfgang, his German name variant, Farkas originated from the gens (clan) Bejc (or Beuch), a minor Hungarian kindred, which possessed lands in Vas County around their centre, Bejc (present-day part of Bejcgyerty√°nos), near the village of Rum. A large-scale woodland between K√°ld and Bejcgyerty√°nos is still called \\"Farkas-erd≈ë\\" (lit. Farkas' Forest) today, presumably named after the bishop. Through his brother Paul, he had a nephew Nicholas, who was granted the castle of Hrics√≥ (present-day Hriƒçovsk√© Podhradie, Slovakia) by B√©la IV of Hungary in 1265, courtesy to his uncle. The clan existed until the middle of the 14th century.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Bejc) Farkas bore the title of \\"magister\\", demonstrating his potential education and skills in science. He was a staunch supporter of King B√©la IV during his civil war against his son, Duke Stephen. He served as vice-chancellor and provost of the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Chapter from 1262 to 1268. As a candidate of the monarch, he was elected Bishop of Zagreb by some members of the cathedral chapter in the second half of 1262, but the election was not confirmed by Pope Urban IV, because B√©la's rival, the influential cardinal Stephen B√°ncsa suggested his namesake nephew at first, then the chamberlain of his household, Timothy to become the Bishop of Zagreb. Farkas was unanimously elected Bishop of Gy≈ër around April 1268, as a result he was replaced as vice-chancellor and provost in that year. His election was confirmed by Pope Clement IV.

The first fire occurred at St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/louisiana- black-church-fire-hate-crime.html Ten days later, two other historic black churches, Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, were also set on fire‚Äîon April 2 and April 4 respectively. The suspect used gasoline at each church, destroying them completely. This incident raised officials' concerns that the fires had been started by a racist and/or radical group or person. Police arrested the suspect, the son of a St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputy, six days after the third fire. Holden Matthews, 21 years old, was charged with the destruction of the churches. Incident The St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Louisiana, was the first in a series of three African-American churches, over 100 years old, that burned to the ground on March 26, 2019. On April 2, 2019, a second church, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, was set on fire. The third church, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church also in Opelousas, was set alight on April 4, 2019. Holden Matthews was arrested on April 10 and charged with three counts of arson. Gasoline was the primary accelerant used in each fire. The churches were empty and no injuries occurred in any of the incidents. Only one of the fires forced people to evacuate, when it spread to a neighboring home. The local fire marshal, Butch Browning, confirmed the existence of a receipt showing Matthews had bought oil rags and a gas can. These materials, along with a lighter, were found in Matthews's truck, Browning said. He also said that Matthews filmed the church fire on his cellphone. History A report published by the National Fire Protection Association showed a declining number of fires within religious and funeral properties. Between 2007 and 2011, however, 16% of the fires at these properties were ruled intentional. John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, said that the chain of fires was \\"especially painful because it reminds us of a very dark past of intimidation and fear\\". Black churches have been the targets of racist attacks across the American South since the 1950s. During Reconstruction and the civil rights movement, black churches dealt with arson, bombings, and other forms of armed assault. A group of young adults burned three black churches in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1996. Officials later labelled this incident a hate crime. In 2015, a white supremacist gunman Dylann Roof opened fire on a prayer group at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina killing nine black people. Nearly 200 years before, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church's predecessor had been burned to the ground in 1822 by Charleston's white leaders, who feared an insurrection by the city's enslaved residents. In 2016, a man in Mississippi pleaded guilty to arson for setting fire to a black church. He had attempted to disguise the arson as a hate crime. In a coincidental church fire in Caddo Parish region, on March 31, a small fire occurred at the United Pentecostal Church. After officials investigated it they reported no evidence was found to tie it to Holden Matthews. Arrest Holden Matthews, 21 of St. Landry Parish, the son of a sheriff's deputy, was charged with committing arson at three black churches. He was arrested two weeks after the first church was set on fire. Louisiana Fire Marshal H. \\"Butch\\" Browning said, \\"We are extremely, unequivocally confident that we have the person who is responsible for these tragic crimes on these three churches\\". Matthews had no prior hate crime charges or arrests. A court affidavit outlines the reasons the investigators turned their attention to Matthews. They found the remains of 2-gallon gas can in Matthews' vehicle, and video surveillance captured his truck moments before the Greater Union Baptist Church fire started. Also, a firefighter reported seeing a pickup that looked like Matthew's vehicle near the burning church. The affidavit said federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents discovered a gas can at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church. A local Walmart employee confirmed that two Scepter-brand gas cans, a lighter and a 10-pack of automotive cloths were sold on March 25, about three hours before the first church fire. After more investigation detectives found that the purchase was made with Holden Matthews' debit card. In addition, Matthews' vehicle was captured by Walmart store CCTV. People who were near two of the fires, and called 911 to report them, said they saw a vehicle that looked like Matthews' pickup before the fire started. James Doherty, the State District Judge, denied Matthews' bond request during the Court proceedings because of the \\"substantial amount of evidence\\" against him. Matthews had visited the sites ahead of time and used his phone to photograph and take video of the locations. Matthews wore an orange prison jumpsuit and remained silent. His parents were only allowed to watch their son via a video link. His father, Deputy Roy Matthews, was seen frequently wringing his hands and he finally left the room crying. Roy Matthews had no prior knowledge of his son's crimes according to St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz. When Guidroz called him to police headquarters to tell him about the charges, he \\"broke down\\", and later helped police to arrest his son. Guidroz said, \\"We are all sure that Holden's father is a gentleman and good employee. He had a very terrible time after this incident.\\" Investigators found that Matthews was attracted to a type of music called \\"black metal\\". Black metal is an extreme kind of heavy metal music linked to arsons at Christian churches in other parts of the world in the 1990s. He frequently posted on social media about pagan beliefs or traditions, and had recently uploaded picture of a gun and a knife with the caption, \\"I carry this..... maybe not legally but I only truly follow the law of Odin.....\\" (Odin is a pagan Norse god). Aftermath The NAACP has called these fires incidents of \\"domestic terrorism\\", adding that \\"church burning in Southern states is a reflection of the racial reactions.\\" Monica Harris, 57, a member of the Greater Union Baptist Church, felt sadness since the historic church burned down on April 2. She believed a part of her family history perished along with it. She was baptized and married there, and her parents were buried in the cemetery on the church's grounds. She said, \\"I was sad because I felt my parent lost their calm in their grave after church fire, when Matthews was arrested, I felt my parents are able to rest again.\\" A GoFundMe page was put up by the Seventh District Baptist Association, a 149 year old non-profit religious organization. The goal was initially to raise but was later increased to $1.8 million, which was successfully reached within weeks. Donations were provided by journalists Megyn Kelly, Aileen Getty and Jake Tapper. Investor and philanthropist Robert F. Smith also provided a donation. According to The Daily Advertiser, the local bank IberiaBank and a car dealer donated to rebuild the churches. Reactions This incident coincided with Notre Dame church fire in Paris. Donald Trump and Mike Pence tweeted about US support for Notre Dame church and France. Then, American Twitter users started a campaign to raise funds for the three burned black churches in Louisiana. Journalist Yashar Ali said, 'The Notre Dame will be rebuilt, but at this time, three black churches in Louisiana were destroyed by fire and need your help. It was a racist attack and the attacker has been charged with hate crimes. Please join me in donating.' Derrick Johnson, the N.A.A.C.P. president, condemned and said, \\"For many years, black churches have served as a symbol of hope for many of African-American people, and unfortunately these churches have been the targets of hate crimes.\\" Congressman Clay Higgins said, \\"I'm suggesting that the fires were related, because the churches burned in a same method.\\" Former State Senator Elbert Guillory said, \\"We always have been a good relationships in our society between black and white residents. So the main question is: where does this come from? Who's doing it and for what reason?\\"  See also  * List of attacks against African-American churches * Escondido mosque fire, arson attack that occurred in the same month * Macedonia Baptist Church arson  References  2019 disasters in the United States 2019 fires 2019 in Christianity 2019 in Louisiana March 2019 events in the United States April 2019 events in the United States Churches Churches Racially motivated violence against African Americans Attacks on religious buildings and structures in the United States Attacks on African-American churches United States crime- related lists ","title":"Louisiana black church fires"},{"id":"60509532","text":"Gordon Clunas was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s and 1940s.

It was initially serialized in eleven issues published by Image Comics between December 2017 and January 2019, then reprinted in two paperback collections. The creators worked with colorist and editor Alissa Sallah and letterer Deron Bennett. Set in a medieval kingdom, the fantasy story is about Lady \\"Poppy\\" Pyppenia, the illegitimate daughter of the recently deceased king. Poppy and Cyrenic, her personal protector who does not need sleep because of a magic spell, are unsure if they have a place in the royal court when Poppy's uncle becomes the new king. When assassins target Poppy, she believes they were sent by the new king's daughter and nephew out of fear she will try to usurp the throne. Despite being in love with Cyrenic, the king suggests Poppy marry his nephew. On their wedding night, her husband is killed by the mastermind behind the assassination plot, which is motivated by revenge against her father. The series received generally positive reviews. Although some plot elements were criticized for being clich√©, most critics praised Poppy's memorable characterization and del Duca's distinctive art. Reviews were split on the effectiveness of the story's narrative pace and the handling of expository dialogue. Publication history =Development= Prior to working on Sleepless, writer Sarah Vaughn had previously created the webcomic Sparkshooter and co-wrote the fifteen-issue Image comic series Alex + Ada with Jonathan Luna from 2013 to 2015. The initial concept for Sleepless came to her when she had trouble falling asleep, and she developed it over the course of a few years. Vaughn was approached by artist Leila del Duca, who was working on the Image comic series Shutter, about collaborating on a romance comic at the 2015 New York Comic Con. Vaughn sent del Duca a short list of story pitches, and she selected the one that became Sleepless. When del Duca's saw her work schedule would open up in early 2017, the two submitted the idea to Image. The publisher liked it and the series was officially announced on March 2, 2017, at the Image Expo segment of the 2017 Emerald City Comic Con. =Production= When Vaughn and del Duca began working on the project, they recruited Alissa Sallah, an intern at del Duca's art studio, to be their colorist and editor. A piece written by Sallah had been published in the Image comic book Bitch Planet: Triple Feature, but Sleepless was her first big art job in the comics industry. Both del Duca and Sallah were involved with any changes to the plot. They based their fantasy world on cultures from the early 16th century. Unlike typical medieval fantasy settings which are derived from Northern European cultures, Sleepless is a combination of Mediterranean and North African cultures, particularly Moroccan culture. The artist's initial research included watching The Borgia, Ever After, and other films with a similar setting. Then she began mixing in Moroccan patterns and designs. The uncommon inspiration allowed the team more freedom in their designs. In addition to the nontraditional visuals, both leads are non-whites, which is unusual in the genre, and the plot subverts traditional female roles in fantasy by having their decisions and actions be vital to plot twists. Sallah colored del Duca's line art with a simple wash style to enhance del Duca's emotive lines, and avoided using saturated color to maintain the Old World setting. Their letterer, Deron Bennett, created a unique font specifically for Sleepless. The logo was designed by del Duca, who started with medieval typography before trying to make it \\"feel sleepy and flowing\\". Within the context of the story, the creative team intentionally kept magic subtle and mysterious. Image assigned the comic a \\"young adult\\" rating instead of the more common \\"mature\\" label, but the creators did not intentionally tone down elements to achieve it. =Publication= The first issue was released digitally and to comic specialty shops on December 6, 2017. Estimated physical sales of the first issue were around 9,500 copies, putting it the 174th position on the month's sales-by-units chart. Sales fell steadily with each new monthly issue, and the sixth issue had estimated sales of 2,900 copies in May 2018, putting in at the 381st chart position. There was a four-month gap between publication of issues six and seven. During the break, Image made a digital version of the first issue available for free. A paperback collection of the first six issues was released July 11, 2018. When the series returned to monthly installments after its hiatus, estimated sales had fallen another 300 units, or ten percent. On November 13, 2018, del Duca announced on Twitter that she was working on the final issue. The conclusion had been planned from the beginning, as Vaughn prefers to write stories that are complete and definite rather than being serialized without end. Although initially expected to run twelve issues, the series concluded at issue eleven. The final issue sold an estimated 2,200 copies. A second paperback volume released on March 13, 2019, collected the final five issues. Synopsis =Characters= * Lady \\"Poppy\\" Pyppenia is a teenager and the illegitimate daughter of the king of Harbeny and a foreigner. During her father's reign, Poppy enjoyed an active role in the royal court. * Cyrenic is a member of the Sleepless Knights, men who use magic to shorten their lives in exchange for a state of constant wakefulness. Unlike other members of the order who are pledged to the throne, Cyrenic made his vow directly to Poppy at her father's request following an assassination attempt on her life several years before the story begins. The spell is beginning to have side effects, and Cyrenic believes he will soon enter a sleeping state from which other knights have never awoken. * King Surno is Poppy's uncle on her father's side and has lived in Edtland for many years. When Poppy's father dies, Surno returns and is crowned king of Harbeny. * Princess Rellen is Surno's only child. She is near Poppy's age and has prominent scars on her face due to acne. * Lord Helder is Surno's nephew by marriage. He aspires to be Surno's heir. * Lord Otrano was an advisor to Poppy's father, and his services are retained following the coronation of King Surno. =Themes and symbolism= According to the creators, time is the most important theme in the story. Critics also identified agency, sleep, dreams, memories, and death as prominent themes. Poppy's name is an allusion to opium, which is made from poppy flowers. Opium was used to help people sleep in medieval times, and this led to the flower becoming a common symbol of sleep and death. =Plot= ;Book One Following the death of her father, the king, Poppy is uncertain of her place in the royal court and wishes to travel to her country estate or her mother's homeland. She makes a formal request to King Surno at his coronation, but that night an assassin attacks her and Cyrenic in the castle. Poppy believes Princess Rellen was behind the attack to prevent Poppy from trying to usurp the throne. Surno denies her travel request, saying she will be safest if she remains with him. To celebrate the new king, a tournament of knights is held in his honor. To gain the favor of Surno and Rellen, Poppy grants her chooses Lord Helder as her champion in the competition. Cyrenic defeats Helder, winning the tournament. His prize is a walk with the king at a time of Cyrenic's choosing. The tournament is followed by a feast, where Poppy's pet alerts her to poison on her plate. Shortly thereafter, Poppy has a private conversation with Rellen, confessing that she only wants to leave Harbeny and bears Rellen no ill will. Rellen reveals she has a bracelet that tells her when people are lying to her, then admits that her concerns about Poppy had been fed by Helder. Together, they suspect Helder is behind the two assassination attempts. On the way back to her chamber, two more assassins attack but are killed by Cyrenic. Before dying, one confesses that Helder hired them. Poppy and Cyrenic go to the king, who is already meeting with Helder. King Surno suggests the two of them marry to legitimize Poppy's place in the court before Poppy explains what the assassin told her. Surno calls for Rellen, who uses her bracelet to monitor Helder's responses. Rellen admits Helder's careful denials are true, but the king ignores her when she requests to ask more direct questions. Frustrated by these developments and worried he will be unable to protect Poppy if his wakefulness spell falters and he falls asleep, Cyrenic plans to murder Helder. Poppy voices her love for Cyrenic and begs him not to do something that will cause his death. He kisses her in return, but refuses to change his mind. With no other way to stop him, Poppy recites the incantation that releases Cyrenic from his vow. He immediately falls into a deep sleep. ;Book Two One year later, Cyrenic is still asleep. Court physicians do not know what to expect because no Sleepless Knight has ever been released before. His body has been moved to the crypt where former Sleepless Knights are also kept. No other threats to Poppy's life have arisen, and plans for her marriage to Helder have moved forward despite Poppy's continued suspicions. Cyrenic awakens, but it takes him time to adjust to his new condition. In addition to being rested, his body is weak and his mind is uncertain because his vow no longer guides his actions. His relationship with Poppy sours over her coming marriage. After Poppy and Helder are married, they retire to his bed chamber to consummate their union. With Poppy's prompting, Helder admits that he was behind the assassination attempts, but he now hopes they can rule together. Poppy tells him she has no intention of assisting him, and will actively work against him for the rest of his life. Helder moves to attack her, but she evades him and bloodies his nose. She flees, letting him be seen chasing her through the castle. Cyrenic sees her and helps her escape. Lord Otrano appears behind Helder and chastises him for failing before pushing him over a ledge to his death. He then spreads rumors among the uncertain witnesses that Poppy pushed him with Cyrenic's help. King Surno organizes a search party to locate Poppy and Cyrenic with orders to kill them. Poppy and Cyrenic sneak back into the castle to find out who has betrayed them. Guards loyal to Otrano capture them and he explains that her country estate used to belong to his fianc√© and be part of another kingdom. When his fianc√©'s family supported an enemy of Harbeny, Poppy's father annexed the estate, removed record of her family, and granted the land to Poppy. Otrano has wanted revenge ever since, and he has been behind all the assassination attempts on Poppy's life, including the one years ago that led to Cyrenic guarding her. King Surno is called to witness their executions, but Cyrenic reminds him of his prize from the tournament and demands they take their walk before he is put to death. Cyrenic recounts what Otrano told them, and Surno believes the truth. Otrano is executed. Poppy and Cyrenic travel to her country estate to live in peace. Reception Sleepless received mostly positive reviews upon release and throughout its run. It appeared on numerous critics' \\"Best of 2018\\" lists and was frequently described as one of the best fantasy comics. Poppy was singled out as one of the most memorable female protagonists of 2018 by Barnes & Noble. The first issue began in medias res with three nearly silent pages with much subtle foreshadowing. ComicBook.com called it \\"ideal\\" and credited the narrative pace for its success. The story's structure was compared to a Shakespearean drama by Adventures in Poor Taste. The amount of exposition divided critics, with Comics Beat believing it was well-handled while Bleeding Cool thought there was too much. The issue lacked a cliffhanger or unexpected twist, which led Comic Book Resources to conclude the story might read better in longer installments. Poppy's depiction was praised throughout the series for being memorable, compelling, and relatable. The romance between her and Cyrenic was well executed according to Comics Beat, but Bleeding Cool compared it to Jane Austen novels and called it \\"common and dull\\". In a later review, Comic Bastards acknowledged the clich√© elements, but argued the world the team has built was fascinating enough to overcome that weakness. Later elements of the story were contrasted with other modern comic series. Multiversity Comics took special note of how effective the narrative ellipsis between issues six and seven was, which is a plot device infrequently used successfully in comic books. Both Comics Beat and ComicBook.com appreciated the self-contained nature of the story in an industry where most stories are continuing, interconnected, or both. Many critics applauded del Duca's artwork. Black Nerd Problems said the art is what set the comic apart from others, and Comic Bastards said the art had a fairy tale quality perfectly suited to the story. The character's costumes were called \\"beautiful\\" and \\"ornate\\", and del Duca's linework was described as \\"intricate\\". Many important story elements are nonverbal, and Comic Bastards felt del Duca's layouts did an excellent job of guiding a reader's eye to prevent those points from being overlooked. Bleeding Cool agreed with this sentiment, adding that illustrating emotion appears to be del Duca's specialty. Reviewers disagreed on how best to describe the style, with some comparing it to paintings while others compared it to Art Nouveau or woodblock prints. Adventures in Poor Taste thought Sallah's colors were too dull, but Multiversity Comics felt they were \\"exotic\\" and Comic Bastards thought they complemented the artwork well.

It is a decision-making process that aims to establish the best possible methods and tools of preservation and treatment. The conservation-restoration of Mesoamerican literature is essential for understanding the ancient civilizations of Mexico. Efforts of restoration have proved difficult due to their fragility and importance of preserving historical and evidential value. Non-invasive technologies have been a more recent advancement, making analysis and treatment of pre-Hispanic codices a delayed process. As analysis continues, digitization has also been a more recent and valuable means of making information accessible to a wider audience, thus contributing to further research and preservation. A page of the Precolumbian Mayan Dresden Codex  Extant codices  Page 71 of the Codex Borgia, depicts the sun god, Tonatiuh. The Pre-Hispanic world had a rich tradition of writing and tlacuilolli (the art of painting codices) before Spanish colonization of the Americas when almost every native document was destroyed. The mere thirteen existing pre-Hispanic codices are now separated into three groups according to geographical region and subject matter. The Mixteca group originated from the Mixteca region of southwestern Mexico and contains predominantly myths, royal genealogies and history. The codices from this group include Codex Zouche- Nuttall; Codex Vindobonensis Mexicanus I; Codex Selden; Codex Bodley; and Codex Colombino. The Borgia group are believed to have been created in the Mixteca-Puebla region of central Mexico and they contain calendrical and ritual information. This group includes the Codex Borgia; Codex Cospi; Codex Laud; Codex Fej√©rv√°ry-Mayer; and Codex Vaticanus B. Maya codices contained calendrical, astronomical and ritual information and are well known for being the source of today‚Äôs understanding of Maya civilization. The surviving pre- Hispanic Maya codices include the Dresden Codex; Paris Codex; and Madrid Codex (Maya).  Post-conquest and recovery  Almost all archives and codices of ancient Mesoamerica were destroyed as a result of conquest. Missionaries, physicians, and naturalists from Europe desired to understand and preserve aspects of native customs. Francisco_Hern√°ndez de Toledo was sent to Mexico by the king of Spain in the 16th century to research medicinal properties of plants and native uses of plants. Friar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n also made it his life‚Äôs work to preserve the cultural heritage of the people of Tepepulco (present-day Hidalgo). Efforts such as these required them to learn native techniques to reproduce and preserve ancient knowledge in its traditional form. These preservation efforts were within a larger context of the assimilation of native people, and the documentation of native traditions by Europeans can be understood as a retelling through the lens of the conquerors. Much of what is known of Mesoamerican codex-making has been interpreted through these documents and reproductions. Preserving the last remaining codices means understanding how they were created; what materials and colorants were used; and what purposes they served. Recent efforts in codex preservation include non-invasive analysis; preventive conservation practices; digitization and reproductions.  Non-invasive analysis  Non-invasive analysis through use of portable tools has been of vital importance to the conservation of Mesoamerican codices today. This is due to the delicate nature of the materials and pigments. ‚ÄúThe multi-technique integrated approcach‚Äù of MOLAB in studying the Codex Cospi employed UV-vis absorption and emission to determine the sources of red colors on the pages. The reflectance spectra (absorbance maxima at 370,530 and 555 nm) indicated that there were features of ‚Äúan anthraquinonic lake of animal origin‚Äù. The UV-vis reflection measurements were taken using a portable spectrophotometer. Portable devices ensure that the object is not over-handled. X-ray fluorescence (XFR), Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV- vis), Optical microscopy, and reference materials (historical documents and a preparation of Maya Blue) were all used in the analysis of Codex Cospi to determine the sources of the different colorants used. And this was done without having to remove samples from the codex. The only invasive analysis carried out on the existing pre-Hispanic codices has been limited to small samples of the paper. In analyzing the Maya codices, analysis has confirmed the paper material as bark from ‚Äúone or more species of the genus ficus\\" with a white layer of calcium carbonate. The only direct invasive analysis performed on the Madrid Codex consisted of an ‚Äúexamination of two bark paper samples‚Äù and was performed by Fudolf Schwede. Both non-invasive and previous destructive analysis has shown the use of carbon black was homogenous between Cospi, Codex Fej√©rv√°ry-Mayer, Madrid Codex (Maya) and Codex Colombino. Recent technologies have enabled conservators and scientists to examine these documents without excessive handling or invasive sampling while much more has been discovered in regard to materials, colorants, and context. = X-ray fluorescence (XRF) = This method determines the chemistry of an object sample by measuring the fluorescent (or secondary) X-ray emitted from a sample when it is excited by a primary X-ray source. = Infrared (IR) spectroscopy = IR spectroscopy is used in determining and identifying the structural composition of an object. It measures absorption, emission and reflection of infrared light interacting with a molecule. = Raman spectroscopy = A technique used to detect molecular vibrations. Used in the chemical analysis and characterization of solids, liquids and gases. = UV-vis = Ultraviolet- visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy determines the concentration of analytes in a solution through light absorption or reflectance. = Optical microscopy = This method employs the use of an optical microscope to analyze a sample. = Digital microscopy = Digital microscopyemploys a microscope that has a digital camera attached. This allows for images of a sample to be viewed and analyzed on an electric monitor display. = In Situ analysis = The first page of the Codex Fej√©rv√°ry-Mayer The existing pre-Hispanic codices have been examined in situ while employing different MOLAB techniques. These techniques include digital microscopy, Raman, UV-vis reflectance, and emission spectroscopy. To avoid stress, damage, and movement, supports were created by conservators to imitate the zigzag screenfold structure of the codices. In examining the fragment Cortesiano, part of the Madrid Codex, a specially designed support was created to hold the document vertically so that the images would be visible without having to handle them during analysis. The colorants, stylistic elements, and material components allow a better understanding of certain differences, as well as technical relationships between the codices, which contribute to the overall knowledge of the codex- making tradition in Mesoamerica. Infrared spectroscopy allowed for analysis of the white layer covering on each side of the Codex Cospi and Codex Ferj√©rv√°ry- Mayer to be identified as a composition of gypsum and calcium carbonate. The white layer on the Codex Ferj√©rv√°ry-Mayer is ‚Äúcomposed of a mixture of two different hydration forms of calcium sulfate: gypsum and anhydrite (anhydrous calcium sulfate)‚Äù. In all the codices that were analyzed, the white layer on the back and front of each codex were identical in composition which provides evidence that the white background was ‚Äúprepared in a single moment, independently from the painting sessions‚Äù. Analysis between the codices have indicated ‚Äúclear-cut division between the Borgia group and Mixtec codices,‚Äù which have gypsum-based paint covering an animal skin support, in contrast with the Maya codices which have a calcium carbonate-base covering a paper support.  Preventive conservation and agents of deterioration  Preventive conservation is the process and practice of eliminating or slowing the effects of agents of deterioration. It requires constant assessment of environmental factors that put the collection at risk and must consider the effects of certain agents of deterioration on the various materials that make up the collection. The agents of deterioration that may put a collection at risk are physical forces; theft; fire; water; incorrect temperature; incorrect relative humidity (RH); pollutants; dissociation; pests; and light. This practice has become interdisciplinary and often requires a collective knowledge of science, ‚Äúchemistry, physics, biology, engineering, systems science, and management‚Äù all while considering different value systems of different cultures. = Materials = The Borgia Group are composed of long strips of deer hide folded like an accordion and sized with white gesso. The covers consist of hide or wood attached to each end. The Maya codices, in contrast, are composed of a long strip of bark paper, or Amate, folded in the same accordion-like, screen- fold way as the Codex Borgia group. The most important codices were likely adorned with jaguar fur covers, although there is only documentational evidence of this. In applying preventive conservation techniques to the preservation of Mesoamerican codices, the material composition of these objects put them at high risk. The colorants used on each of the codices are both organic and inorganic making the composite nature of these books difficult to preserve. The ‚Äúdetection of orpiment on the verso of Codex Cospi and on both sides of Codex fej√©rv√°ry-Mayer‚Äù proved most unexpected as an inorganic pigment containing high amounts of arsenic trisulfide in the Raman spectrum. As some of the codices contain inorganic pigment, such as carbon black, they require attention to environmental pollutants that might react with or change the chemical structure (such as corrosion or dissolution of constituents). Along with the organic and inorganic pigments, gypsum and calcium carbonate were other compounds detected through analysis. Organic materials such as bark paper, deer skin, and colorants are highly susceptible to deterioration from fluctuations in RH as well as incorrect RH. Furthermore, organic materials are hygroscopic (absorbing and emitting water). These materials attract mold, insects, rodents and other pests, and they are highly sensitive to light. The complex organic components of Mesoamerican codices, along with their fragility due to age, require a strictly controlled environment that limits exposure to light and maintains correct RH and temperature. ‚ÄúIt takes time for objects made from hygroscopic materials to adjust to changes in RH‚Äù, which ‚Äúcan range between a few hours (such as a sheet of paper) to several weeks (such as a wooden sculpture)‚Äù. Although short-term fluctuations may be tolerated, damage can result in situations where the extreme change in temperature or RH remains long enough for the object to respond. Through assessing all the possible risks, conservators develop strategies that aim to balance these risks with the appropriate risk management strategies. Digitization and sharing of information are of utmost importance for improving the field of Conservation-restoration. A push toward digitization and digital records management will also work to prevent risks of dissociation.  Treatment of Post-Hispanic codices  In the periods after conquest, there is evidence of a fusion of Spanish and Native influence that became common in manuscript making. Post-Hispanic codices contain a mixture of both Native and European styles and materials. Treatments have been conducted on Mesoamerican codices to prevent further decomposition and to assist in preservation. In current treatment of such codices, it is sometimes necessary to reverse old treatments for further preservation. Although, in the field of Conservation-Restoration it is recognized that no treatments are fully reversible. In the more recent treatment of the Huexotzinco Codex, or Huejotzingo codex, the decision to unbind the pages, clean and treat them was agreed upon after careful consideration. Panel 1 of the Huexotzinco Codex; the panel contains an image of the Virgin and Child and symbolic representations of tribute paid to the administrators = Documentation = The condition both before and after treatment is to be thoroughly documented. Documentation often includes images for reference. A treatment proposal is prepared, revised, approved and documented as is the entire treatment process. = Handling = The delicate leaves of the codex are placed in polyester film sleeves during analysis and treatment to protect them during handling. = Cleaning = The leaves, or pages, of the codices can first be dry-cleaned with grated Staedtler Mars plastic eraser crumbs as used in the treatment of Codex Huejotzingo. Tests are conducted to determine how the ink and leaves will react to aqueous treatment. The risks of aqueous treatment on Mesoamerican codices include the ink seeping further into the pages and stresses from expansion and contraction. Nonaqueous treatments are preferable for Mesoamerican codices. A solution of methyl magnesium carbonate was used in cleaning the Codex Huetjotzingo in which the leaves are submersed to give them an alkaline reserve. Tetrahydrafuran (THF) is used to remove adhesives and staining caused by adhesives from the leaves prior to treatment with methyl magnesium carbonate. = Treating tears and areas of loss = Mending with Japanese papers is a preferred method of repairing areas of loss. A micrometer is used to determine and match the thickness of the leaves. Matching the thickness of the leaves is important for preventing new stresses when the pages are put back together. = Treating ink-damaged leaves = Heat-set tissue toned with acrylic pigments is a preferred material due to flexibility, strength, and reversibility. This method also proved beneficial for attaining the appropriate tone of color. = Treating silked pages = Silking is a treatment method in which large areas of loss are filled with laid paper with a layer of Cr√©peline (a French close-weave transparent silk) applied over it., Treatment of Silked Pages The process of silking causes the ink to blur over time and sink through to the opposite sides of the pages. To treat the silked pages of the Huejotzingo Codex, an aqueous solution was needed to remove the silking. \\"An alpha amylase enzyme solution was selected to detach the silk from the paper without transfer of ink\\"  Digitization, reproductions, and access  plates 10 and 11 of the Dresden Maya Codex. Drawing by Lacambalam, 2001 Concerning the surviving pre-Hispanic codices, digitization serves to contribute to new research findings and continued linguistic studies of ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. Research can be more easily conducted without having to travel around the world to view the codices in person. Allowing physical contact with the codices for research purposes contributes to risks of light exposure; physical risks of handling; environmental risks; and even possible theft. Facsimiles have been produced and published on Mesomerican codices in efforts to preserve their contents and to make them accessible. They are used by researchers and students to contribute to the knowledge of the pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican world as well as historical evidence of the impact of Spanish conquest.  Historical evidence of pre- Hispanic codex making  Aztec feather artisans or painters. Florentine Codex (ca. 1576) with native drawings and Nahuatl text Bernardino de Sahag√∫n recorded names and characteristics of plants and colors used by painters and documented his research in the Florentine Codex. The Florentine Codex is a primary resource for understanding the creation and uses of codices, as well as for understanding the politics of post-conquest Mexico. The use of gypsum, tzacuhtli (organic glue extracted from orchids), nacazc√≥lotle (dark red obtained from the wood of Caesalpinia coriaria), have all been described in the writings of Sahag√∫n and others. Francisco Hern√°ndez recalls that t√©zhuatl (yellow-red extracted from Miconia laevigata) ‚Äúwas commonly mixed with cochineal and alum in order to obtain‚Äù the color. This mixture is ‚Äúsimilar to the one detected on Codex‚Äù Cospi. Descriptions from the early years of conquest describe not only the materials and uses of codices, but also the reasoning and process of their destruction. The \\"fields of Maya epigraphy and religious iconography were born through the pioneering efforts of Ernst F√∂rstemann, Eduard Seler, and Paul Schellhas,\\" through early studies of the Dresden Codex. The Madrid Codex (Maya) is especially important to researchers in that it was likely in use from the second half of the 15th century through the first decade of the 17th century, and it contains a paper patch with Latin and Spanish text. This codex is a ‚Äúcompilation of information‚Äù drawn from across space and time as various portions are the ‚Äúresult of the conversion in a Maya format of central Mexican almanacs such as those found in‚Äù codices from the Borgia group. This suggests that scribes had direct access to the Borgia Codex or other related manuscripts. The ‚Äúintrusion of European stylistic elements,\\" ‚Äúover time, would become more prominent in tlacuilolli, to the point of eclipsing the ancient native traditions‚Äù  References  Book arts Preservation (library and archival science) Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Illuminated manuscripts Collections care ","title":"Conservation and restoration of Mesoamerican codices"},{"id":"60509833","title":"Radio (Rammstein song)"},{"id":"60509850","text":"Reza Andouz (, born 31 March 1965) is a retired Greco-Roman wrestler from Iran.

Freyer was born in Moradabad in India, where his father, Peter, was serving in the Indian Medical Service. He was largely brought up in Dublin, and he was educated at Wellington College, then attended Trinity College, Cambridge, followed by the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine. Before graduating from Edinburgh, he met Oliver St John Gogarty, who convinced him to leave the university and focus on writing. He spent some time as a reader for Charles Elkin Mathews, and in this role rejected James Joyce's Dubliners, describing two of its stories as \\"almost obscene\\". In Edinburgh, Freyer met New Zealand- born Lorna Doone, although she contracted tuberculosis and was advised to return to New Zealand. Freyer moved to Cambridge, and was soon joined by Doone, the two marrying in 1909. During 1912, Freyer served as joint editor of Granta, despite not being a student at the time. He fell out with his co- editor, Denis Garstin, but was given a say in appointing the next editor, Edward Shanks. Despite Lorna spending much time away due to poor health, the couple had three children: Patrick, who became an architect, Grattan, who founded a pottery, and Michael, who became a hotel manager. Freyer joined the London Irish Rifles in 1905, and served with them throughout World War I, apparently based in London and given charge of fitting soldiers' uniforms. Despite this, he was promoted to become a major. In 1919, Lorna died in the Spanish flu epidemic. Freyer also joined the Labour Party, for which he was elected to Cambridge City Council. He stood for Parliament on numerous occasions, without success: in Huntingdonshire at the 1922 United Kingdom general election, the Isle of Ely in 1924 and 1929, and Hitchin at the 1931 United Kingdom general election. In 1932, Freyer wrote the semi- autobiographical novel, Not All Joy. In 1934, he moved to Achill Island off the west coast of Ireland, purchasing the house which had once belonged to Charles Boycott. He converted it into a hotel, and on Sundays, held song and dance events, open to all. He ran it on a haphazard basis, not charging guests who were short of money, but charging extra to anyone who did not take a daily bath. By 1964, he was running out of money, and sold the hotel, returning to Cambridge. Freyer had three sons. Freyer's sister Kathleen married Colonel John Duncan Grant VC, a British Indian Army officer. Freyer died early in 1970, and was buried at Grantchester Church, near Cambridge.

The opening took place on September 2, 2017. It is part of the extension of the U1 from Reumannplatz to Oberlaa.  Station conditions  The station Altes Landgut was built about 1.6 km south of the Reumannplatz in a low-lying area under the square called Altes Landgut, known in traffic announcements as Verteilerkreis Favoriten, and under the Favoritenstra√üe. The name comes from a restaurant on the northern slope of Laaer Berg that was demolished in 1900. Today's square is located on the top of the mountain, so it is, as far as sea level is concerned, the highest station on the U1 or the entire Vienna U-Bahn network. The station serves theUniversity of Applied Sciences Vienna Campus, in German FH Campus Wien, the football stadium Generali Arena, and the summer spa Laaerbergbad, all three of which are in the immediate vicinity. Furthermore, you can change here (as before from the tram line 67) to the bus line 15A, which crosses the route of the U1 and connects Meidling (U4, U6) tangentially with Simmering (U3). The extent to which the station will be used for \\"Park & Ride\\" by motorists of the S√ºdosttangente (A23) in the Laaerbergtunnel between the Altes Landgut and the subway line depends on the expansion of the parking lots near the station. For this purpose, and for the planned construction of a new neighborhood around the subway station or the traffic circle, a press release by the Planning Department of the Vienna City Administration was published in the spring of 2014.Neuer Stadtteil am Verteilerkreis, Meldung vom 3. At the end of 2015, project partner Asfinag announced that the construction of the new neighborhood would be postponed for several years for economic reasons.Verbauung des Verteilerkreises verschoben; Meldung auf der Website des ORF vom 22.  Design  On the distribution floor of the station, the walls of the escalator were provided with the large-format mural \\"face-tracking snails\\" (Gesichts√ºberwachungsschnecken) by the Swiss computer artist Yves Netzhammer. The total of 63 stylized portraits are a playful tribute to the diversity of people and the ubiquitous monitoring by face recognition. They are humorous depictions with many loving details. The drawings were applied to the metal plates by means of digital direct printing (DDP) and a special paint that uses light interference effects. This flip-flop lacquer causes the color to be perceived differently from different angles; the drawings therefore seem to change as you pass by on the escalator. Also in the distribution floor is a small figure of Saint Barbara, the patron saint of miners.

It is located in the Pathankot district on the border with Jammu and Kashmir. The Upper Bari Doab Canal (UBDC) off-taking from Madhopur irrigates agricultural lands in Punjab and provides water to the cities of Gurdaspur, Batala and Amritsar. The headworks was one of the first irrigation projects constructed in Punjab during the British Raj. It irrigated lands in the Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Lahore districts of the undivided Punjab. During the partition arrangements, Cyrill Radcliffe allocated three tehsils of Gurdaspur district to India in part to maintain the integrity of the canal system from Madhopur. After independence, India signed the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan obtaining the exclusive use of waters from the Ravi River. Subsequently, India rebuilt the Madhopur headwork as a full barrage. Pakistan continues to use the UBDC canal network within its territory, replacing the Ravi waters by waters from Chenab via the BRB Canal.  Antecedents  A canal by name Hasli canal was constructed during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (), taking water from Madhopur to Lahore. It was planned by Ali Mardan Khan and executed by Mullah Ala'ul-Mul Tuni. In the 19th century, the Sikh emperor Ranjit Singh refurbished the canal and extended it with another branch to Amritsar. According to scholar Ian Stone, these early canals were defective in many ways. They did not utilise masonry structures and easily gave way to floods. They were also prone to silt deposits and therefore had to be periodically refurbished.  British projects  Districts of Punjab during the British Raj. The Bari doab consisted of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Lahore, Montogomery and Multan districts. Irrigation map of Punjab (1911) depicting the Upper Bari Doab Canal network After conquering Punjab from the Sikhs in 1849, the British East India Company rebuilt the canals under the name Upper Bari Doab Canal (UBDC). It was planned and carried out by engineers Joseph Henry Dyas and James Crofton.: 'Madhopur Headworks project was carried out under the direction of Lt. (later Lt-Col.) H. Dyas, a 26-year-old subaltern, who had already done good work on the Western Yamuna Canal. From 1850 the Headworks steadily grew, and in 1859 water from the Ravi was admitted into the Bari Doab Canal. In 1868, when Chief Engineer, North-Western Provinces [now Uttar Pradesh], Dyas died from overwork at the age of 44, \\"...a sacrifice to his devotion to his duty and his work\\".' Providing employment to the disbanded Sikh soldiers via agriculture is said to have been the main motivation for its urgent construction. The new canals were opened in 1859 and irrigated agricultural lands in Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Lahore districts. No headworks were constructed at this time due to apprehensions that they would not be able to withstand the floods of the Ravi River. A side channel of the river with a weir and falling shutters regulated the canal waters. A bridge with 23 arched openings 10 feet wide was constructed for this purpose. The head of the Bari- Doab Canal, Madhopur (watercolour painting 1865), British Library, retrieved 1 May 2020. Modern commentators also note that the canal was constructed with an excessive slope of 0.05 m/km which caused erosion of its bed. The Madhopur headwork was added during 1875‚Äì1879. It consisted of a long weir across the Ravi river, with the crest varying from 3 feet to 6 feet above the bed of the river. The last 300 feet towards on the left (towards Punjab) held undersluices with 12 openings of 20 feet width and 3‚Äì4 feet height. They were operated by iron gates. Even though the canal system was capable of carrying flows of per second, the headwork supplied a maximum of per second. The main line of the canal ran to after which it divided into a main branch and a Kasur branch near the town of Gurdaspur. The two branches had further subbranches leading to Lahore and Sobraon respectively. * The main branch flowed past the towns of Batala and Amritsar and headed towards the village of Bedian in the Lahore district. It continued in the Lahore district flowing past the villages of Raiwind and Kot Radha Kishan. An escape to the channel of the Ravi River allowed any excess flood waters to drain back into the river. * The Lahore branch took off the main branch near Batala and, flowing past Amritsar on its north, headed towards the city of Lahore. * The Kasur branch ran south from Gurdaspur till the town of Kahnuwan and then turned southwest. Flowing past Batala and Tarn Taran Sahib, it entered the Kasur tehsil near the village of Patti (now in Tarn Taran district). * The Sobraon branch continued south of Kahnuwan and turned southwest. Flowing parallel to the Sutlej River, it ended near Sobraon (to its north). Most of these areas were later scenes of conflict during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.  Partition of India   Modern development  In 1955, a full barrage was constructed at Madhopur after the original weir of the Madhopur headwork got damaged in a flood. Over the next two years, a Madhopur‚ÄìBeas Link canal was also added, to link the Ravi waters to the Beas River via the Chaki nalla.Canal Administration Post-Independence, Department of Irrigation, Government of Punjab, retrieved 5 May 2020.

The congregation is based in the oldest GKSA building still in use in Namibia.  Beginnings  The Biermanskool congregation was founded in 1955 as the Vanjaarsveld Reformed Church, probably named after Dm. H.S. van Jaarsveld, who founded the first GKSA church in South West Africa in 1930. In 1961, the name was changed to Outjo-Wes, but in 1985, it finally received its current name. The congregation's church lies on the Urumbe farm near Kamanjab. (The latter town had its own congregation, the Kamanjab Reformed Church, from 1969 to 1977, but its origin and history is poorly understood.) A school operated for the children of GKSA worshippers here, named as the congregation eventually would be for a Monsignor Bierman, who depending on the source was either an education inspector for the church or an administrator for the SWA government. There was no church there at Urumbe farm; therefore, the local GKSA folk, mostly descended from those on the Dorsland Trek who were repatriated to SWA from 1928-1930. A canvas tent was used at first, later followed by the schoolhouse refectory. At the time, the area around the farm was considered the Vanjaarsveld district of the Outjo Reformed Church.  Church building  Around 1948, work began on a church building for the Vanjaarsveld district under the architect Max Ecker, a German who had retired there. Danie Oosthuizen was chairman of the building committee. The district collected ¬£230 for building the edifice. According to legend, a member took the money to buy cattle and a windmill for himself, and was then forced to pay for the building, completed in 1949, out of his own pocket. Dm. J.W.J. van Ryssen, pastor for the Outjo church from 1949 to 1953, presided over the opening in February 1949. In the centennial year of the GKSA (1959), the Vanjaarsveld congregation had 91 confirmed members. By the end of 1997, there were only 25, but the number had rebounded to 45 by the end of 2014. Biermanskool had been grouped with Outjo, Aranos, Otjiwarongo, Namib-Kus, and Khomas-Hoogland were grouped under the Klassis Waterberg, while the other 12 Namibian congregations formed Klassis Etosha. In 2016, all the Waterberg churches, save for Otjiwarongo which joined Etosha, left the GKSA.

She writes in both Papiamento and Dutch. In 1976 she received award, one of the Netherlands' highest honors for youth literature for her book Nancho van Bonaire. In 2003 she earned the inaugural Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds Caribisch Gebied (PBCCG Cultuurprijs, Prince Bernhard Caribbean Cultural Fund Prize) for her book Caimin's geheim and in 2007 she was honored as a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Early life Diana Melinda Lebacs was born in 1947 in the Chere Asile neighborhood of Willemstad in the Dutch colony known as the Territory of Cura√ßao. The year after her birth the country would become the Netherlands Antilles, a constituent state of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Her mother, Esther Amalia Doelwijt, was from Suriname and spoke Sranan Tongo, having moved to Cura√ßao at the age of eighteen. Her father, Willem Mertjo Lebacs, was a chief customs officer, who also worked artistically as a carpenter and woodcarver. Willem's father was from Bandabou on Cura√ßao and had completed his military service in Indonesia and married a Malay woman there before returning to Cura√ßao. Her grandmother never learned Dutch and only spoke the Malay language and Papiamento. As her parents could only communicate in Dutch, Lebacs grew up speaking Dutch and Papiamento at home. After Lebacs completed her primary education at the Philomena School she attended the Mar√≠a Immaculata Lyceum for her secondary studies. During this time, (1960‚Äì1961) she began writing novels for teenage girls and sang in a band, Teenage Shadows, from 1963 to 1966. In 1966, she graduated from the Willemstad Pedagogical Academy and the play performed at the commencement ceremony, Regels voor ezels (Rules for Donkeys) was written by Lebacs. The following year, married Pacheco Domacass√©, who had directed Teenage Shadows and would later head the cultural section of the Education and Cultural Department of Bonaire. They would subsequently have two children. Career In May 1968, Lebacs' mother died and in August she and her husband embarked on a tour of western Europe over the next six months. During their travels, she began to write a novel, Sherry‚Äîhet begin van een begin (Sherry‚ÄîThe Beginning of the Beginning), a coming of age story of an Antillean girl which delved into the socio-economic development of the islands and the labor strikes which occurred in conjunction with anticolonial uprisings in Cura√ßao in 1969. That summer, she sent the book to Leopold Publishing in The Hague and waited six months for their response. After agreeing to publish the novel and completing the edits they wanted, in 1970, Lebacs enrolled in a two-year literary course in Papiamento to gain a better insight into the lingua franca of her homeland. She wanted to publish children's stories in the language spoken by children in the Dutch Antilles. In 1971, Sherry premiered and two years later was translated into Finnish by the publisher Tammi. Also in 1973, Lebacs wrote a youth theater play, which was the first dramatization written in Papiamento in over twenty-five years. Buchi Wan pia fini (Buchi Wan Skinny Legs), premiered with her husband as director, as a critique of European education systems and featured live exchanges between the actors and the audience. After the debut, the play was presented several times in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura√ßao and it was published in 1974. At the beginning of the next six years, Lebacs published a new work. Her 1975 book, Nancho van Bonaire earned the (Silver Stylus) award in 1976, the first time the honor had been given to a non-European author. Lebacs continued working on several fronts simultaneously throughout the 1980s and 1990s. She published children's fiction in Dutch and Papiamento, educational textbooks for elementary students, developed television programs about the Spanish and Dutch colonization history of Curacao, and acted in two films, Famia kibr√° and Boka Sarantonio (Sarantonio Bay). She also participated in community projects including book fairs, workshops to end violence against women, and programs to protect the environment. In 1994, Lebacs published her first novel for adults, De langste maand (The Longest Month), which evaluates disparities in traditional local values and Westernized expectations. In 2003 Lebacs earned the inaugural Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds Caribisch Gebied (PBCCG Cultuurprijs, Prince Bernhard Caribbean Cultural Fund Prize) for her book Caimin's geheim (Caimin's Secret) and in 2007 was honored as a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau. That same year, she completed her bachelor's degree in Papiamento at the University of the Netherlands Antilles and went on to earn her master's degree in 2011. Subsequently, she began teaching courses in Papiamento at the university for beginning students. In 2014, Lebacs debuted her first collection of poetry, Belumbe/De Waterlijn (The Waterline).

Biography Denis was called \\"frater\\" (\\"friar\\") in a document from 1270, thus he belonged to one of the religious orders (possibly Benedictines or Cistercians). He was made Bishop of Gy≈ër in 1270, not long before the death of B√©la IV of Hungary, but it is possible that he already held the office from the previous year. He was a confidant of Stephen V of Hungary, who confirmed and transcribed several donations to the Diocese of Gy≈ër during his short reign. In 1271, Stephen V also granted the \\"right of Feh√©rv√°r\\" to Gy≈ër, i.e. promoted to the status of free royal town. After the death of Stephen V, the Kingdom of Hungary fell into anarchy, when many baronial groups fought for the supreme power during the nominal rule of the minor Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Under such circumstances, the Diocese of Gy≈ër was constantly threatened by the Austrian troops of Ottokar II of Bohemia. Taking advantage of chaotic situation in Hungary, Ottokar's army invaded the borderlands of Hungary in April 1273. The influential prelate, Job Z√°h arrived to the region with his army and expelled his fellow bishop Denis from the castle of Gy≈ër and made himself the captain of the fortress. The Austrians, however, besieged and took the fort. When the Hungarian royal army recovered the castle, Denis returned to the town. Thereafter Denis frequently resided in the royal court beside Ladislaus IV and his faction. Following the skirmish, Denis negotiated with Ottokar over a conclusion of peace. Denis attended the Synod of Buda in September 1279, convened by the papal legate Philip, Bishop of Fermo. Denis served as bishop at least until 1285, when he was last mentioned by contemporary records. His immediate successor, Andrew first appeared in this capacity only in 1290 or 1291.

Gilson is the largest producer of custom snowboards and skis (custom artwork). The company locally sources its hardwoods from sustainably harvested Pennsylvania poplar and states a commitment to responsible manufacturing.  History  Gilson Snow was founded in 2013 out of the classroom by Nick Gilson (CEO) and Austin Royer (COO) in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Gilson and Royer were working as middle school science teachers, (Gilson through Teach For America) when they created year-long \\"curiosity projects\\" with their students. Gilson and Royer led an example project, out of which the first Gilson prototype was born. They relocated to a donkey and horse stable in Winfield, Pennsylvania later that year to build the company with limited resources. During this time, the early Gilson team lived in a cabin in the woods with no running water or electricity, hiking out each day to their makeshift factory in the stable. A year later, the growing team moved their headquarters down the road to the 17-acre farm that now holds their current manufacturing facility. This is also where they host their annual \\"Summer Snow Day\\", a free summer festival with music, food and beverage trucks, games, and snowboarding.  Technology  Gilson skis and snowboards are known for their proprietary fluid dynamics-inspired design and their notable collaboration artwork. Nick Gilson created the \\"soft edge\\" after observing that all objects moving through a fluid, e.g. boats and planes, are curved to maximize efficiency. Gilson grew up surfing and sailing which inspired his initial design. Their signature Pow Channel (raised central region) design was influenced by the advantages of the catamaran over mono-hulled boats, and reduces contact with the snow's surface, in turn reducing drag. The soft edge allows for a 'floating' feeling on top of the snow and minimizes hang-ups or edge-to-feature contact while the SuperFlex makes it easier to lock down presses and snap on or off rails.

Her father died of tuberculosis when she was two years old. Her mother moved to Sheffield leaving her daughter to be brought up by an aunt in Macduff. At the age of 14, she relocated to Sheffield to join her mother, who had begun work at the Day Training College for Teachers in Sheffield and in 1905, became Vice-Principal of the City Training College. At this time, she felt able to care for her daughter again. Henry was educated at the Sheffield High School for Girls. She enrolled in the Sheffield University Medical School in 1909. In June 1916, she graduated with an MB ChB, and along with fellow student, Florence Elizabeth Millard, they were the first women to receive a medical degree from the university. The next day she became the first woman to work as a hospital doctor in Sheffield.  Medical career  Henry had further experience working as a house officer in Sheffield Royal Infirmary and the Sheffield Royal Hospital. During the World War I, it became easier for women doctors to find posts in teaching hospitals, as many male doctors were serving in the armed forces. Her experience included working in the Sheffield Royal Infirmary women's clinic for venereal diseases, the first woman doctor to do so. The day after finishing as a house officer and becoming fully qualified to practise medicine, Henry enlisted in the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service (SWH), working in the hospital set up in Royaumont Abbey, north-east of Paris. She arrived in July 1917 and was the youngest doctor on the staff. There, as an assistant surgeon, she had charge of the Blanche de Castille ward. She later served at the associated SWH hospital at Villers-Cotter√™ts, which treated French rather than British soldiers. After the war the French government awarded her the Croix de Guerre. After the war, Henry worked on her MD thesis, which was on gangrene, based on her experiences with the condition at Royaumont. With this thesis, in 1920 she graduated from the University of Sheffield with the degree of MD, the first woman to do so. Appointment as assistant medical officer of health for Blackburn, Lancashire, followed. Her success in this post led to her appointment as head of the Social Services Department at the King's College for Women of the University of London, and she went on to become a member of its Senate. Henry emigrated to Canada in 1925 and married, becoming Mrs J. Stewart Henry. She stopped practising as a physician. During World War II, she returned to Scotland, providing assistance onshore for the submarine crews operating out of north-east Scotland. In 1978, the University of Edinburgh medical school awarded her the degree of DSc, on the occasion of its 150th anniversary.  Death and legacy  She died in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, on 27 March 1985. A memorial to her memory was erected in her birthplace, Macduff, Scotland.

It also tries to establish the superiority of ancient Indian philosophy over modern Western thoughts on the basis of the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Puranas. Background In June 1888, Manilal's article on Advaita appeared in the Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr die Kunde des Morgenlandes (Vienna Oriental Journal). Encouraged by the warm response it received abroad he decided to prepare a scientific treatise on Advaitism in English, comparing it with the Western theory of Monism. Within fifteen days he wrote out 100 sheets and sent the book to the press under the title Monism or Advaitism?. Spanning 104 pages, Monism or Advaitism? was first published in 1889 by the Subodha-Prakash Press, Bombay, with subtitle, An Introduction to the Advaita Philosophy read by the light of Modern Science. Contents Title page of first edition, 1889 In the book, Manilal tries to compare the Advaita Philosophy with the Western theory of Monism. He pointed out that the principle of unity of nature was common to the Indian advaita and the scientific theory of evolution in the West. But, the former was far more advanced than the latter, which was only in the primary stage of speculation. Manilal hoped to establish complete identity between the two by comparing them. Manilal analysed the principles underlying Monism and Advaitism and highlighted the essence of both by pointing out that the theory of evolution was based on the unity of nature and the principle of advaita aimed at the identity of all the elements of nature. According to him, the principle involved in advaita was, rationally speaking, more developed than that of Monism. Manilal then proceeds to compare the concepts of God in the light of the two theories. He explains the Semitic concept of God implying duality between man and God, while the Advaita Philosophy posits the experience of identity between the two. In the experience of perception also, advaita asserts the identity of Agent (Karta) and Action (Karma) or that of the Seer (Drig) and the Seen (Drishya). Manilal calls the religion of Advaita philosophy as \\"scientific religion\\" because it signifies the culmination of human intellect in an extremely rational thought. The belief in a transcendent God could hardly accommodate science and scientific progress; but as he emphatically argues, Advaitism, which asserts the possibility of experiencing the one all-pervading brahman (the Ultimate Reality) offered an intellectually satisfying religion. In the terminology of Indian philosophy, Manilal calls these two approaches as Karma-marga (path of worshiping an omnipotent God) and Jnana-marga (the path of science or scientific religion). The book was received well by western scholars.

Long since utilized as a theater, the site is now occupied by offices for the Centro Italiano di Documentazione sulla Cooperazione e L' Economia Sociale. History The theater was inaugurated on 3 October 1814, under the patronage of doctor and entrepreneur, Antonio Contavalli, in a lot that once formed part of the Carmelite convent affiliated with the church of San Martino. The engineer was Giovanni Battista Martinetti and the architect was Giuseppe Nadi. The entrance was the stairwell entrance to the monastery, but the three-story newly built hall, seating up to 800 attendees, and the theater curtain were decorated with paintings by Antonio Basoli. Other portions were decorated by Pietro Fancelli, Luigi Cini, Ridolfo Fantuzzi, and Mauro Berti. The stucco work was by Pietro Trifoglio. The style of the decoration was described as Pompeian (19th-century interpretation of Ancient Roman motifs) in style. The initial premiere featured Matilde ossia la Selvaggia by Carlo Coccia. Soon after the theater premiered the opera, L'Italiana in Algeri by Rossini and sung by Maria Marcolini, proved to be successful, and moved to the Teatro Comunale and the Teatro al Corso. In 1816, the opera house put on a performance of Barbiere di Siviglia, also by Rossini; and this house was often used to present plays by Rossini in Bologna,Biblioteca Salaborsa, description of theater history. such as Matilde di Shabran o sia Bellezza e Cuor di ferro.Comune of Bologna, exhibition on history of theater in Bologna. In 1824, the Accademia Filodrammatica, led by the Marquis Massimiliano Angelelli, decided to focus on classic theatrical performances. This caused dissenting members to form a faction opposed to the purists, with the support of the Cardinal Legate, they formed the Societ√† dei Concordi, which patronized modern works, often with controversial political overtones, at the Contavalli. In 1876, a new production company, the Accademia Filodrammatica Albergati was formed under marchese Gioacchino Napoleone Pepoli, and affiliated with this theater. In 1888 Alfredo Testoni, with the help of the Societ√† del Dottor Balanzone, who was affiliated with the Contavalli, formed a company dedicated to performances in local dialect and vernacular. Among the players were Argia and Guglielmina Magazzari, Augusto Galli, and Carlo Musi. The first work they sponsored was a comedy in Bolognese dialect titled Pisuneint (Pigionanti) by Testoni.Notice on the hundred year anniversary of premiere of Pisuneint by Testoni. By 1909, Testoni had joined the theater company with Goffredo Galliani, and they performed Acqua e ciacher in the then-refurbished Contavalli theater. It presented many performances by Angelo Gandolfi. However, the theater company was soon splintered by acrimony between the actors. The theater continued under Galliani until 1938, when it became a movie theater, until 1979, when it was functioning as a cinema for pornographic films (cinema a luci rossi).

Dedroog was sentenced to life imprisonment for the double murder, 25 years for the France murder and is currently being investigated for the Spain killing. Biography Not much is known about √âtienne's early life, but it was known that he was very attached to his mother. When she passed away in 2007, at the same time period he was getting a divorce, Dedroog experienced a mental breakdown the following year. According to reports from psychiatrists and psychologists, he has a \\"psychopathic personality\\", referring to his morbid egocentrism and tendency to manipulate others. =Murders= V√©ronique Crettaz Before settling in Crettaz's rural B&B; home in Bouchet, Dedroog committed fuel fraud, as well as scamming tens of hotels and B&Bs; in Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, Carpentras, Ved√®ne and Caderousse. In October 11, 2011, he killed the 57-year-old by cutting her external carotid artery, before stealing her credit cards and escaping in her car towards Spain. Tomas Mart√≠nez L√≥pez On the early morning of November 16, the 76-year- old L√≥pez had decided to go fishing near the Cabo de Gata-N√≠jar Natural Park in Andalusia. After mentioning his intentions at a bar where he had breakfast, he travelled to a location called Cala Raja, only to be later found dead on a gravel road with his car missing. Initially believed to be an accidental fall that had caused the death, it was later revealed that L√≥pez had been killed by a violent blow to the head with a rock, which had fractured his skull. His missing car was found on December 10 in La Jonquera, with DNA traces from the steering wheel matching those of √âtienne Dedroog. At the time of the murder, Dedroog was in Almer√≠a, working as a seasonal orange grower. Authorities later learned that between November 17 and 25, the suspected killer was spotted first in Valencia and then Huesca before returning to Belgium. While examining the deceased's home, they also found a bill issued in Dedroog's name from a hotel in Benidorm, disposed of in the wastebucket. Martin and Mia Blankaerts After arriving in Grandvoir, Neufch√¢teau, Dedroog was directed towards lodging at the Blankaerts' house (71 and 69 years old, respectively). Deciding that he wanted to steal their car, but was afraid that they would notice him, √âtienne subsequently strangled the couple. He then stole their car and a computer, before eventually abandoning the car in Bruges. Surrender and trials On December 1, Dedroog sent a message to his niece on Facebook, stating that he \\"does not recognize [himself] anymore\\", that \\"he did not deserve to be called a brother\\" and that \\"he had done more serious things than Ronald Janssen\\". The day after, he surrendered himself to the police in Leuven. He immediately confessed to killing the Blankaerts, and on November 7, 2014, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Assizes in Arlon. However, he vehemently denied killign Crettaz, despite admitting that he had indeed stayed in her lodge on the date of death. Despite the best efforts of his defense team, Dedroog was sentenced to a further 25 years imprisonment by the French assize court. Since 2015, after a complete investigation, the Spanish police have officially suspected Dedroog as the killer of L√≥pez, and the lawyer has requested, on behalf of the victim's family, an extradition so he could face trial.
