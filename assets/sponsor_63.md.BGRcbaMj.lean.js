Female sex trafficking victims originate primarily in Eastern Europe and former Soviet bloc countries. Traffickers use physical, emotional, and sexual abuse for coercion. Greece's European Union membership, coupled with a shared border with Turkey, means the country sees massive flows of illegal immigrants looking to enter the EU. Traffickers also use Greece not only as a destination but also as transit stop and also as a source country where evan Greek women are prostituted on the way to Western Europe. The Government of Greece does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government made clear progress in prosecuting labor and sex trafficking offenses, identifying victims, implementing a child victim protection agreement with Albania, and advancing prevention activities. Concerns remain about trafficking-related police complicity, inadequate victim identification among the Hellenic Coast Guard, border police, and vice police, as well as inadequate funding for anti-trafficking NGOs.\\"Greece\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The economic crisis in Greece also places strains on allocation of funding and resources towards anti-trafficking efforts. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Overview of human trafficking The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defines human trafficking as \\"the recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation.\\" All of the world's countries are affected by human trafficking, either as a source, destination, or transit country, or a combination of the three. According to the International Labour Organization, an estimated 2.4 million people are victims of trafficking at any given time. Global trade in women is estimated to be worth between 7 and 12 billion dollars annually; the chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) stated that human trafficking may even have overtaken drug trafficking as a lucrative criminal enterprise.Hughes, Donna M. \\"The \\"Natasha\\" Trade: The Transnational Shadow Market of Trafficking in Women.\\" Journal of International Affairs 52.2 (2000): 625-51.

As of 2010, an estimated 270,000 people are trafficking annually in Europe, with 40,000 women and children aged 12‚Äì25 trafficked annually to Greece, as well as an even larger number that are trafficked through Greece and from Greece to the rest of the European Union.Kim, Jeong- Yeoul.

Print. Destinations =Greece as destination= According to the 2001 Greek census, there were 797,091 documented foreigners living in Greece, with a large number from Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Russia. Ten years before that, the number of legal immigrants was only 30,000. By 2009, the immigrant population had expanded to 1.2 million in a country of just of 11 million citizens‚Äîlegal immigrants make up more than 10% of the Greek population, and the number of illegal immigrants increases the percentage of immigrants even more. The exponential increase in migration to Greece serves as a cover for traffickers, and facilitates their transportation of women for work in the sex industry in Greece, also because prostitution is legal in Greece. Because of the ease with which traffickers can disguise foreign victims among the immigrant population, Greeks are not typically the targeted victims of traffickers; instead women are brought in from outside the country to fuel the sex industry. Women are brought to Greece from a variety of places, but a large number come from Eastern Europe‚Äîa full 50‚Äì55% of sex workers in Athens are from former Soviet bloc countries. Greece is also a destination country for a large number of trafficked Romanians.Although, many foreign prostitutes can be disguised easily among immigrants in Greece, many Greek women have been involved voluntarily in the prostitution industry. Almost all prostitutes in Greece were Greek females before 1992. However by 2009, number of Greek prostitutes increased a lot percentage wise. Different reports state that number of Greek prostitutes increased 150% after 2009 by compossing manybe half of the 20,000 estimated prostitutes in Greece. =Gateway to the European Union= A large number of trafficked persons are trafficked through Greece on their way to Germany or other Western countries. From the 1970s onwards, migrants from Asia and Africa began to enter Greece as a temporary stop on their way to other, more developed Western European countries. Since then, immigration into Greece, legally and illegally, in order to gain access to the rest of the European Union has increased, and traffickers have taken advantage of this as well. There are two main trafficking routes that go through Greece in order to reach the European Union. The first is the Balkan Route, through which victims are moved from the Balkans into Slovenia, Hungary, Italy, and Greece, and from there to the rest of the EU. The second is the Eastern Mediterranean Route, which moves victims from Turkey through Greece into Bulgaria and Romania. Some accounts have estimated that Greece's border with Turkey serves as the ‚Äúback- door‚Äù entry point for close to 90% of the illegal immigrants to the European Union, and this number includes those transported illegally for purposes of sexual exploitation.Levers, Lisa L., and Debra Hyatt-Burkhart. \\"Immigration Reform and the Potential for Psychosocial Trauma: The Missing Link of Lived Human Experience.\\" Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy 00.00 (2011): 1-10. Print. Victims Experts struggle to profile human trafficking victims because they come from a wide variety of countries and backgrounds and experience different forms of economic and sexual exploitation and abuse. There are certain characteristics that many victims in Greece share, and they face similar challenges and dangers even after being rescued. =Characteristics= Over 60% of all migrants to Greece, legal and illegal, are female, and over 20,000 migrant women are trafficked annually to work in Greece. Approximately 40,000 women and children aged 12‚Äì25 are trafficked each year in Greece. The majority of these women today are from Eastern European and Balkan countries, such as Russia, Ukraine, Slovakia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Moldavia, but there are a fair number from Asia and Africa as well.Emke-Poulopoulos, Ira. \\"Trafficking in Women and Children: Greece, a Country of Destination and Transit.\\" Mediterranean Migration Observatory (2001): n. pag. Print. More than half the women trafficked in Greece are estimated to be from Russia and the Ukraine alone.Monzini, Paola. \\"Trafficking in Women and Girls and the Involvement of Organised Crime, with Reference to the Situation in Central and Eastern Europe.\\"International Review of Victimology 11.1 (2004): 73-88. Print. One study from 2001 estimates that 75% of trafficked women in Greece are brought into the country under false pretenses and, believing that an opportunity for lawful employment awaits them in Greece, suddenly find themselves sold to those involved in the sex trade and threatened with violence and deportation if they refuse to cooperate, and they become too frightened to report it. The average age of a sex worker in Greece is also lowering, and currently sits at about 12‚Äì15 years of age. Trafficked women work anywhere from 6 to 12 hours a day and see anywhere from 40-110 clients a day. 70% or more of their earnings, however, go to the brothel owners or pimps in order to keep the women in debt bondage. Trafficked women are likely to face physical abuse, threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and to experience drug and alcohol addiction, injuries resulting from violence, and various mental health problems as a result of the trauma they are exposed to. Women who are victims of trafficking also often suffer from sexually transmitted diseases and other infectious diseases. A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive. =Challenges after trafficking= Even after having been freed from entrapping situations, victims may face symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the physical, emotional, and sexual trauma to which they were exposed. Additionally, victims may be stigmatized, marginalized, and discriminated against as a result of their experiences. They often find it difficult to go back to their home countries, where they are no longer considered respectable women, and they find it equally difficult to start a new life in the country into which they have been trafficked. Women freed from trafficking situations face the added danger of a possible return to the sex trade, whether because it is the only life they know or because they are not adequately protected. An estimated 80% of women deported from Greece by train never make it back to their home country because it is common practice for the traffickers to board the trains and force them back to Greece before they reach their destination. Traffickers Traffickers involved in Greece are largely Albanian, Greek, and Russian, and while Greeks are also victims of trafficking, Greek citizens do participate in the trafficking of non-Greek nationals. Traffickers recruit victims through false advertisements for low skilled jobs with good salaries, such as waitresses, nannies, dancers, or hostesses; one study of newspapers in Ukraine showed each newspaper contained 5‚Äì20 suspicious adverts. Traffickers sometimes use a woman's legal documents and visas to get her into Greece and then confiscate them so she cannot leave. Additionally, traffickers use threats, intimidation, and physical, emotional, and sexual abuse to control these women and force them into prostitution. Contributing factors to trafficking =Historical factors= During the 1980s, the majority of foreign prostitutes in Greece originated from Asia, specifically Thailand and the Philippines. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, trafficking in women from former Soviet bloc countries rapidly expanded as women looked to improve their social and economic standings by moving West. This meant they could be taken advantage of by traffickers with the promise of a job in Western European countries. Former Soviet republics such as Belarus, Latvia, Russia, and the Ukraine have become major sending countries for trafficked women. Today, 50-55% of trafficking victims in Athens are from former Soviet bloc countries, and more than half of the women trafficked into Greece overall are estimated to be from Russia and Ukraine. =Political factors= The political situation in Greece regarding immigration, legal and illegal, facilitates the trafficking of women into and through Greece. Greece experienced massive immigration from the Balkan region in the 1980s and from Central and Eastern Europe in general in the 1990s. By 2009, Greece's legal immigrant population had expanded to 1.2 million, or 10% of the Greek population. At the time when these immigration flows were rapidly expanding, the Greek government and immigration policies were unprepared to deal with such a large number of immigrants; Greece's ability to deal with the multitudes of illegal immigrants was even less developed. The challenges Greece has faced with its large immigrant population and implementing successful immigration policy allows migrants that are trafficked and forced into prostitution to slip through the cracks and allows traffickers to hide them among the general migrant population. Greece's European Union membership, coupled with its geographical location between East and West, also contributes to its role as a transit nation in trafficking routes. As a gateway to Western Europe, victims are often trafficked through Greece in order to reach other EU countries. Greece's border with Turkey is also a hotspot for illegal immigrants looking to find their way into the European Union; from 1991‚Äì2001 over 2.2 million migrants who had entered Greece illegally were deported, and the vast majority of these had arrived in Greece through Turkey. In 2001, 6,471 immigrants were apprehended at sea trying to reach Greece from Turkey. An estimated 90% of the illegal immigrants to the entire European continent enter the EU through Greece's border with Turkey; this migration number includes the tens of thousands of trafficking victims. On January 20, 2000, the Greco-Turkish Agreement was signed. Both countries aimed at ‚Äúcombating crime, especially terrorism, organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and illegal migration‚Äù as part of the agreement, in addition to human trafficking between the two countries. =Socio-cultural factors= Strong xenophobic tendencies in Greece also contribute to trafficking. Various studies and polls continuously report Greece as the most xenophobic country in Europe. There is a perception among Greeks that foreign ethnicities are involved in organized crime. Inherent xenophobia in Greece has allowed the trafficking of outsiders; ethnic bias against Albanians and other foreigners has potentially prohibited Greece from recognizing and properly caring for victims who are not of Greek origin. Governmental anti-trafficking efforts There are several international standards for combating human trafficking. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, also known as the Palermo Protocol, lays down universal, fundamental regulations for international organization and cooperation for combating trafficking. Greece signed the Protocol on December 13, 2000 and proceeded to completing the ratification process on January 11, 2011.UN CHAPTER XVIII, PENAL MATTERS, 12 .a Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime The European Union has developed an anti-trafficking response that underpins the ‚Äò3P's of the Palermo Protocol‚Äîprosecution of traffickers, protection of victims, and prevention of trafficking. Since 2000, the U.S State Department has created an analysis of anti-trafficking efforts country by country around the world that ranks each country based on their anti-trafficking efforts, resulting in the annual Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP). From 2001 to 2003, Greece was placed on the Tier 3 list of the TIP report, which means the government was essentially ignoring the human trafficking problem. As the government made strides to address issues of human trafficking, it was moved to the Tier 2 Watch List in 2004, and in 2006 was placed on Tier 2, where it remains as of 2012. =Prosecution= The government demonstrated clear progress in its prosecution of trafficking offenders, though a high-profile case of trafficking-related complicity remained pending in court as of 2010. Under the Alien Act law 1975/1991, which lasted until June 2001, there were penalties for trafficking human beings but there was no legislation specifically criminalizing trafficking. In 2002, Greece passed law 3064/2002, the first Greek law to criminalize human trafficking and outlaw trafficking for sexual and labor exploitation. Police conducted 66 human trafficking investigations in 2009, a 65 percent increase over the 40 investigations in 2008. The government reported 32 new convictions of trafficking offenders in 2009, compared with 21 convictions in 2008. The average sentence for trafficking offenders was approximately 11 years with fines. The Ministry of Justice reported two suspended sentences in 2009. Some convicted trafficking offenders continued to be granted bail pending their lengthy appeals. The media continues to allege that trafficking-related complicity exists among some local police and vice squad officers. In a case cited in the 2010 TIP Report, a trafficking victim was allegedly raped while in police custody in 2006. In a positive development in 2009, one active and one retired officer were held without bail pending prosecution for alleged involvement in sex trafficking. In 2009, the Greek police reported cooperation with counterparts in Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, Romania, and Russia on trafficking cases. As of 2011, Greece has laws and penalties pertaining to Article 2 of the European Directive of 2011, which states all EU Member States must have legislation that punishes traffickers, regardless of the type of trafficking. =Protection= The government has demonstrated some progress in ensuring that victims of trafficking were provided access to essential services. Before 2001, a person who made his or her living from prostitution was liable to prosecution; since then, laws have been implemented that seek to care for the victim and punish the trafficker instead. In 2000 a Task Force against human trafficking was created to identify and assist victims, and in 2007 the largest trafficking ring known to date in Thessaloniki was dismantled. In 2003, Presidential Decree 223/2003 introduced measures for the assistance and protection of victims of human trafficking. In August 2004, a National Action Plan was developed to implement a wide variety of counter-trafficking efforts, including collecting facts and statistics, establishing procedures to identify victims, establish shelters, provide victims with legal recourse, and educating police, judges, and other member of law enforcement. The Ministry of Health trained nurses, medical admissions staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers on the identification of trafficking victims. Similarly, experienced anti-trafficking police continued to provide training to border police, vice police, and the Hellenic Coast Guard on victim identification. Greece provided officially-identified trafficking victims with access to legal and medical services through government-run shelters, public healthcare, and intermittent funding to NGOs. In 2005, law 3386/2005 was passed to better assist victims of trafficking; however, victim identification continues to be a weak point of Greek anti-trafficking efforts. The government officially identified only 125 human trafficking victims in 2009, an improvement over the 78 victims identified in 2008. The government continued to operate a short- term shelter, which could accommodate children, in addition to two long-term shelters for women. The government also referred child victims to orphanages or detention centers that did not have specialized facilities for trafficking victims. One NGO reported that authorities released unaccompanied foreign minors onto the street with little support after detention. The government encouraged victims to participate in prosecutions by offering a 30-day reflection period, a time for victims to receive immediate care while they consider whether to assist law enforcement, but according to NGOs, authorities did not always provide the reflection period consistently during the reporting period. Victims who assisted with law enforcement prosecutions qualified for temporary, renewable residence permits as a legal alternative to removal. NGOs reported excellent cooperation with specialized anti-trafficking police units. Overall, the government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts that may have been committed as a direct result of being trafficked. However, some NGOs reported that the coast guard and border police, overwhelmed with processing refugees and undocumented migrants, had little time to use victim identification procedures. As a result, they sent many potential victims, including vulnerable unaccompanied minors, to migrant detention centers, where they often faced poor conditions. In a positive development, the government implemented a child repatriation agreement with Albania, repatriating six Albanian child victims in cooperation with NGOs. =Prevention= The government has demonstrated steady progress in the prevention of trafficking. In 2009, a state television station aired a special on human trafficking in Greece in addition to other programs on the topic. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke out against trafficking, and since October 2009, anti- trafficking NGOs have reported stronger partnerships with high-level officials. The government, in partnership with IOM and NGOs, provided anti- trafficking training for police recruits and commanders, police from neighboring countries, and over 100 judges and prosecutors. The Minister for Foreign Affairs provided $155,100 toward a UNICEF campaign on trafficking of children as a global phenomenon and funded an International Organization for Migration-produced public awareness campaign acknowledging trafficking as a problem in Greece. The government did not run any new campaigns targeting the clients of prostitution or beneficiaries of forced labor. The government implemented a law enforcement-focused national plan of anti-trafficking action; however, the government lacked a central authority to coordinate ministries‚Äô anti-trafficking efforts and monitor anti-trafficking results. Coordination of data between agencies remained ad hoc. The Greek government facilitated anti-trafficking partnerships by funding initiatives in neighboring countries. Greek law provide extraterritorial jurisdiction over child sex tourism offenses by its nationals; the government did not report any prosecutions of Greek citizens for child sex tourism during the reporting period. The government gave its peacekeeping troops anti-trafficking training before deploying them abroad. Since 2011, Greece is a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. NGO anti-trafficking efforts In addition to governmental efforts, several non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, are also making strides to combat trafficking in Greece. NGOs reported that government grant disbursement delays, onerous reporting requirements, and deteriorating public finances have created financial difficulty for trafficking victim service providers dependent on government funding In 2001, StopNow project was launched to raise awareness and lobby public organizations on trafficking issues. The Marangopoulos Foundation for Human Rights conducts and analyses research on trafficking in women in Greece. The A21 Campaign, an NGO founded in 2008, promotes awareness about human trafficking, and rehabilitates and provides legal support to survivors. In 2009 A21 opened a crisis shelter for victims in Thessaloniki and works with the Greek government to assist trafficking victims. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs works closely with the NGO ‚ÄúSmile of a Child‚Äù to implement an amber alert program aimed at helping trafficked missing children. The Greek NGO ‚ÄúKEPAD‚Äù (Human Rights Defense Center) works to establish and maintain a network or anti-trafficking NGOs in the Balkan region that work cooperatively to combat trafficking. NGOs, some of whom received government funding, reported assisting at least 3,376 trafficking victims in 2009, significantly more than the 125 victims identified by the government. Remaining challenges As of 2012, the Greek government has made important strides in anti-trafficking efforts by tightening legislation and increasing the services and assistance to victims of trafficking in recent years. However, the current economic crisis in Greece has vastly limited the government's ability to help trafficking victims; severe economic conditions have taken resources and attention away from the issue of human trafficking. While the country remains in economic crisis, funding to various social services and anti-trafficking efforts will remain low as economic bailout money is allocated elsewhere.

People who are trafficked are mostly used for sexual purposes or illegal work. These acts include: forced marriages, trafficking for human organs, and gaining members for organized crimes. Every country in the world deals with this crime, and are usually classified as transit countries, target countries, or source countries. Guatemala is a part of North America, which is a target country; this means they contain human trafficking victims. History For the past few years, Guatemala has become a hot spot for multiple types of sex trafficking. Sex trafficking, kidnapping, and illegal adoption rings are part of a larger string of criminal acts. Part of the reason for this is the failure of the peace accords and the government not being able to implement tax reform. Trafficking is also encouraged by a police force that is constantly having to choose corruption or death, and deciding to participate in trafficking to avoid the later. There has also been a number of elected officials who are under investigation for either participating in sex trafficking or protecting establishments were trafficking occurs. It is also believed that ‚Äúterritorial groups‚Äù run brothels which contribute to these sexual acts. These groups are often local gangs running drugs or more established gangs that deal with international drug deals. It is also common for family-run sex trafficking to appear near the border, ports, and underpopulated jungles; which tend to usually go unnoticed. Guatemala has also made major improvements towards fighting trafficking. In 2012, the Guatemalan government established a trafficking prosecution unit that also helps prosecutors in the country's outer regions. There is also talk of this unit being expanded to eight additional states. Types of Human Trafficking The most common types of human trafficking reported in Guatemala is sexual exploitation including: forced prostitution, child sex tourism and child pornography. Sex trafficking in Guatemala is a problem. Sexual types of trafficking are more public as they require a consumer whereas labor trafficking (debt bondage, involuntary domestic servitude, child labor, and child soldiers) is less visible to concerned bystanders. Less common in Guatemala but still existent in some trafficking circles is the organ trade, where people are abducted for organ harvest. People are often upset by the advertising of selling people for sex and are therefore more likely to report these findings to law enforcement. Another large aspect of trafficking in Guatemala is adoption fraud, this is when children are forcefully taken from their biological mothers to be resold to family looking to adopt a foreign child. Guatemala is the second most popular country for foreign adoption after China, which has opened up the market for trafficked children to become a lucrative industry. Statistics Cases of identified trafficking victims have significantly decreased from previous years, dropping from 673 in 2015 to 316 victims in 2018. In this 2018 study it was observed that 292 of the 316 victims were children. Many of the victims are native Guatemalans under the age of 18. The children are often used to collect money though begging, pick-pocketing and working as hawkers. The young women are sexually exploited or sold and young men are forced into gang life, selling and transporting drugs along with other gang related activity. According to the United States assessment of Guatemala in relation to human trafficking, Guatemala has been on the tier 2 watch list for human trafficking since 2017. In 2016 the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) estimate that the trafficking industry involving sexual exploitation brings in $1.6 billion US dollars to Guatemala each year. This is equivalent to 12.3 billion Guatemalan quetzal, which is 2.7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is believed that only 3% of traffickers are known and many run under the name of large trafficking circles to avoid detection. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has stated that there are only two prosecutors willing to convict traffickers in the country, because of this there have been low conviction numbers with only 20 convicted in 2014.  Border Crossings  The borders in Central America involving Honduras, Mexico, El Salvador, Belize and Nicaragua are considered hot-spots for human trafficking supply and transit. Every year many women and children attempt the crossing from Guatemala to the United States though Mexico. They often will wait by the Guatemala-Mexico border and get picked up by traffickers promising safe travel for a cost. Many migrants cant afford it and will later pay though bonded labor or other manners such as sexual exploitation or working as a mule to pay off the debt. A global report on Trafficking in Persons by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported that cross-border trafficking in person originating in Central America and The Caribbean reports for 12% of the all human trafficking detected in North America. It has been stated that Guatemala has highest rates of trafficked child labor in the Americas with over 800,000 children forcefully working for gangs and other organizations.  Prevention  Guatemalan law enforcement require international assistance to fight human trafficking and assure justice. A project funded by the Government of Canada that supports the SICA Member States (Belize, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua) improve the collaboration against Human Trafficking within Central America. The project based on the \\"Comprehensive Strategy to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants\\" by the UNODC for Central America and the Caribbean aims to increase the actual structure of border control in Central America and the Dominican Republic. Guatemala has signed and ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Person. For a more efficient international cooperation that has resulted in a considerable increase in the number of convictions, the government has established appropriate laws. However, while the government has improved its efforts to stop human trafficking, inadequate funding and training remain restricting the capability of the officer division to manage various investigations and prosecutions in the whole country. = Prosecution = Among the new anti-trafficking law and the strengthened enforcement efforts from the government against human trafficking, the Guatemalan government has advanced with investigations, prosecutions, and convictions compared to previous years. In early 2009, to guarantee the appropriate care and compensation for damages to the victims, Guatemalan government in the National Law decree the Law Against Sexual Violence, Exploitation, Trafficking in Persons (VET) as an effort to assist victims. Article 48 of the VET added Article 202 to the Guatemalan criminal code, stating that \\"the capture, transport, transfer, retention, harboring or reception of more persons constitutes a crime of human trafficking\\". Similar to other penalties for severe crimes that are adequately stringent, the new anti-trafficking law prescribes sentence between eight and eighteen years of imprisonment which are sufficiently and rigorous by the government.

The majority of victims are children, and these incidents of trafficking are more prevalent among Guinean citizens than among foreign migrants living in Guinea. Within the country, girls are largely subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation, while boys are subjected to forced begging and forced labor as street vendors, shoe shiners, and laborers in gold and diamond mines.Guinea, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor Some Guinean men are also subjected to forced agricultural labor within Guinea. Smaller numbers of girls from Mali, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Guinea-Bissau migrate to Guinea, where they are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and likely also commercial sexual exploitation. Some Guinean boys and girls are subjected to forced labor in gold mining operations in Senegal, Mali, and possibly other African countries. Guinean women and girls are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and forced prostitution in Nigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Benin, Senegal, Greece, and Spain. Chinese women are trafficked to Guinea for commercial sexual exploitation by Chinese traffickers. Networks also traffic women from Nigeria, India, and Greece through Guinea to the Maghreb and onward to Europe, notably Italy, Ukraine, Switzerland, and France for forced prostitution and involuntary domestic servitude. The Government of Guinea does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The government sustained its efforts to investigate alleged trafficking crimes and detain suspected trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The junta, however, has made minimal progress toward combating human trafficking in Guinea since coming to power in a coup d'etat in December 2008. While Guinea has an adequate anti-trafficking legal framework, which it had strengthened by enacting the Child Code of 2008, the junta did not report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions for the second year in a row, and protection and prevention efforts remained weak. Therefore, Guinea is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year. In February 2009, the head of government issued a declaration giving security forces the right to shoot anyone apprehended while trafficking a human being, raising significant human rights concerns. In the same month, the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking met to evaluate the 2005-2006 National Action Plan and to outline an updated version for 2009‚Äì2011, but released no such document to the public. Many ministries claimed involvement in efforts to address trafficking, but the country was severely limited in its ability to address the problem due to budget constraints, capacity limitations, and unclear allocation of law enforcement and social welfare responsibilities.\\"Guinea\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Guinea did not show progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Guinea prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through separate statutes. The Child Code of 2008 includes provisions prohibiting all forms of child trafficking, specifically criminalizing child domestic servitude, and allowing NGOs to bring cases to court on behalf of victims. The government, in partnership with NGOs and international organizations, has yet to complete the implementing text for this law, which will prescribe penalties that allow the law to be enforced. Article 337 of the 1998 Penal Code prohibits individuals from entering into agreements that deprive third parties of their liberty, prescribing penalties of five to 10 years' imprisonment and confiscation of any resulting profits. Forced prostitution and child prostitution are criminalized by Article 329 of Guinea's Penal Code, which prescribes six months' to two years' imprisonment if the trafficked victim is an adult, and two to five years' imprisonment if the victim is a child. These penalties for sex trafficking of adults are neither sufficiently stringent nor commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not prosecute any human trafficking cases during the reporting period, although the Ministry of Justice reported that there were 13 new cases that involved the arrest of at least 40 suspected trafficking offenders during 2009. Of the alleged traffickers, 30 remain in detention. Another 17 trafficking cases from the previous reporting period continue to await prosecution. The government provided only limited specialized training to its officials on the recognition, investigation, and prosecution of human trafficking, due to budget constraints. Protection The government demonstrated weak efforts to protect trafficking victims during the reporting period. The government reportedly referred an unknown number of potential victims to NGOs and international organizations for assistance, though government officials did not demonstrate use of systematic referral procedures or proactive measures to identify victims among vulnerable groups, such as foreign children at worksites. The Ministry of Social Affairs continued to provide assistance to a few hundred children, a small number of whom may be trafficking victims. The government did not offer shelter for trafficking victims, but frequently assisted victims by contacting local and international NGOs directly to coordinate shelter and family reunification cases. The government did not provide trafficking victims with access to legal, medical, or psychological services, and did not subsidize services provided by foreign or domestic NGOs. Foreign trafficking victims do not benefit from permanent residency status or relief from deportation. The government reported that 106 trafficked children were identified by various entities in 2009, but offered no additional data on these children. The government occasionally provided victims refuge in jails when no alternative was available. The government encouraged trafficking victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, as long as the victim was at least 12 years of age. At the government's invitation, two such victims, one of whom was a child, separately discussed their cases on national television in April and June 2009, though their traffickers had not been brought to justice; this raises concerns for the security and well-being of the victims. Prevention The Government of Guinea demonstrated minimal efforts to conduct anti-trafficking or educational campaigns during the reporting period. The head of the junta, however, gave several speeches highlighting the importance of combating human trafficking. The government did not monitor immigration or emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. The government did not take steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.

Boys are sent to Senegal, and to a lesser extent Mali and Guinea, under the care of Koranic teachers called marabouts, or their intermediaries, to receive Islamic religious education. These teachers, however, routinely beat and subject the children, called talib√©, to force them to beg, and subject them to other harsh treatment, sometimes separating them permanently from their families. UNICEF estimates that 200 children are taken from Guinea-Bissau each month for this purpose, and in 2008 a study found that 30 percent of the 8,000 religious students begging on the streets of Dakar are from Guinea-Bissau. Men, often former talib√©s from the regions of Bafata and Gabu, are the principal traffickers. In most cases they operate in the open, protected by their stature in the Muslim community. Some observers believe girls are also targets, and may be subjected to domestic labor in Guinea- Bissau or Senegal. The Government of Guinea-Bissau does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Despite these efforts, the government demonstrated weak overall progress in combating trafficking during the reporting period, particularly its lack of any effective law enforcement action; therefore, Guinea-Bissau is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year.\\"Guinea-Bissau\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Guinea-Bissau did not increase efforts to prosecute and punish trafficking offenders during the reporting period. Bissau-Guinean law does not prohibit all forms of human trafficking, though it prohibits forced labor under article 37 of the country‚Äôs penal code, which prescribes a sufficiently stringent penalty of life imprisonment. In the previous reporting period, the National Assembly drafted legislation prohibiting child trafficking, though it was not adopted before the legislature was dissolved in August 2008. Guinea-Bissau does not specifically prohibit forced prostitution. The government could use existing laws to punish trafficking cases, such as the laws against removing children, sexual exploitation, abuse, and kidnapping of children, but did not do so during the reporting period. The government neither investigated nor prosecuted human trafficking offenses during the reporting period, due largely to systemic failures that pervaded the judicial system, such as lack of institutional capacity and corruption. Protection The Government of Guinea-Bissau continued to demonstrate efforts to protect and repatriate victims. However, the government did not demonstrate proactive efforts to identify trafficking victims. While the government did not operate victim shelters or provide other victims services directly, it continued to fund an NGO shelter for child trafficking victims in Gabu, providing about $16,000 to the annual operating budget of the facility. Police continued to refer victims to that NGO shelter, as well as a shelter operated by a separate NGO in Bafata. The government continued efforts, as allowed under Guinea- Bissau law, to intercept and return victims domestically and repatriate victims from abroad. The government, together with the Government of Senegal and the Bissau-Guinean Embassy in Dakar, repatriated 43 children during the reporting period. As part of the repatriation process for talib√©s, parents must sign a contract with the regional court accepting responsibility for the safety of their children, and can be subject to criminal sanction should the children be trafficked again. The government held some child victims in transition shelters until it could successfully reunite them with family and ensure that the family would not be involved in the child‚Äôs re-trafficking. No special protections are afforded to witnesses. Police coordinated their repatriation efforts with NGOs, in the last year referring 160 victims to NGO providers of victim services. Victims were frequently too young to contribute meaningfully to any prosecution. However, the government encouraged family members of the victim to assist in any investigation or prosecution of trafficking offenders. Given the widespread cultural acceptance of sending young boys away from home for a religious education, family members often were reluctant to support law enforcement efforts against traffickers. Prevention The Government of Guinea-Bissau continued to make minimal efforts to raise awareness about trafficking during the reporting period. A government-supported NGO trained border guards to identify potential trafficking offenders. Guards detained male adults who could not prove they were the fathers of children trying to cross the border and arranged for their transportation to police headquarters in Gabu. Border guards did not refer these cases to police for investigation, and suspected traffickers were generally released while guards contacted parents to collect their children. National anti-trafficking coordination efforts were hampered by the government‚Äôs failure to implement new programs in 2009 or adopt a previously drafted national action plan. An inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the president of the Institute of Women and Children, met regularly in an effort to coordinate the government and civil society response to human trafficking, but undertook little action. The government did not take measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor during the year. Guinea-Bissau is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Guyanese trafficking victim cases have been identified in the country, as well as in other countries in the region. Identified foreign victims have come from Venezuela and Brazil. Forced prostitution occurs in brothels on the coast and around mining camps, as well as in rum shops and Chinese restaurants. The common Guyanese practice of poor, rural families sending children to live with higher income family members or acquaintances in more populated areas has the potential to evolve into forced domestic servitude. Trafficking victims in Guyana may not self-identify to authorities due to fear of retribution from trafficking offenders, fear of resettlement to abusive home situations, and lack of awareness that human trafficking is a crime. Groups particularly vulnerable to human trafficking in Guyana include Amerindian females, foreign women (such as Brazilians) in prostitution, and children. During the reporting period, the U.S. Department of Labor reported results of a project that withdrew 984 children from exploitive child labor in logging and saw-milling, fishing, hazardous farming, factory work, mining, and freight handling from 2005 to 2009. The Government of Guyana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government did not initiate any new prosecutions of trafficking offenses during the reporting period, and has yet to convict or punish any trafficking offenders under its five-year-old anti-human trafficking law. Therefore, Guyana was placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the fourth consecutive yearin 2010. During the reporting period, the government and NGOs identified four victims of trafficking, two of whom prison officials proactively identified. The government provided some resources toward victim protection and local anti- trafficking groups. No suspected traffickers were charged, limiting the level of safety and protection that could be provided to victims. While the government took some tangible steps to raise awareness of human trafficking, including the establishment of focal point groups and an anti-trafficking task force, some local observers felt that the government discouraged discussions on developing effective strategies for combating this phenomenon of modern-day slavery.\\"Guyana\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government made no discernible progress in prosecuting, convicting, and sentencing human trafficking offenders in Guyana during the reporting period. The Combating Trafficking of Persons Act of 2005 prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties, ranging from three years to life imprisonment, and which are commensurate with those for rape. The government reported four new trafficking investigations during the reporting period, none of which led to prosecutions. The government‚Äôs four prosecutions from previous reporting periods remained ongoing, with no significant progress. To date, the government has not convicted any trafficking offenders. Progress on the prosecution of criminal cases is perpetually delayed by judicial backlogs, incorrectly filed paperwork, or the failure of key parties to appear at hearings. NGO's and one government official expressed concern that trafficking-related official complicity was a problem. It is reportedly common for defendants to bribe court officials for favorable rulings. The Ministry of Home Affairs conducted two anti-trafficking training programs, one in partnership with IOM, for 120 police, prosecutors, and investigators during the reporting period. Protection The government made some efforts to protect victims during the reporting period, but the number of identified victims was low, and the fact that the government charged no trafficking offenders and has yet to convict a trafficking offender undermined the effectiveness of those protections. The government, in partnership with IOM, developed a series of anti-trafficking focal point community groups around the country to help identify and refer possible trafficking victims to assistance organizations. While NGOs reported overall good working-level relations with anti-trafficking officials, some local observers expressed concern that pressure from senior officials may have prompted some lower-level officials to suppress information in order to avoid drawing attention to trafficking in Guyana. The Ministry tried to encourage identified victims to participate in prosecutions of traffickers by paying for travel costs associated with their testifying in court. In one instance, the Ministry hired a private lawyer for a victim. Nevertheless, none of the four victims identified during the reporting period elected to participate in prosecutions. In a positive step during the reporting period, Guyanese prison officials identified two foreign victims of trafficking in detention and referred them to the Human Services Ministry for assistance. The government later dropped pending charges against the two victims. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to their home countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Prevention The government made limited progress in the prevention of trafficking during the reporting period. The focal point groups conducted some public outreach activities in rural communities, including trafficking awareness programs targeting parents in Mahdia and Moruka, and distributing leaflets in Letherm to 440 local community leaders. The Ministry of Human Services continued to distribute IOM-funded posters, leaflets, and bumper stickers nationwide at large public gatherings throughout the year. The Ministry of Amerindian Affairs began a campaign for the issuance of birth certificates, which may have a positive effect on preventing trafficking in Guyana, though one senior official indicated that Amerindians were not as vulnerable to trafficking as other government sources have indicated. There were no campaigns directly aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period.

She was called \\"the protectress\\" for being the mistress of General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, the exalted \\"Protector of Peru.\\" Biography Rosa was the illegitimate daughter of Francisco Herrera Campuzano y Gutierrez, officer, rich cocoa producer, who conceived her with a \\"mulata\\" named Felipa Cornejo.Diccionario Bibliogr√°fico del Ecuador por Rodolfo Perez Pimentel Rosita is described by the chroniclers as a beautiful woman with fair skin and blue eyes, intelligent, breezy and literate. She came to Lima in 1817, after 21 years as mistress of a wealthy Spaniard and soon she became well known in Lima's society. Her social circle was frequented by prominent people. She took advantage of her position as mistress of a royalist general to obtain military information that she supplied to the Peruvian patriot forces. She hid, in her house, official royal army deserters and then; she helped them to join the Patriot Military Forces. Because of this clandestine and subversive activities she was detained for several days. Also, for these activities and attend the same social circles she met Manuela S√°enz, establishing between them a great friendship and complicity in the conspiracy work. Also in 1818 was denounced to the Inquisition for having banned books. On Saturday night, July 28, 1821, the Cabildo of Lima organized a party in the city hall in honor of San Mart√≠n and the proclamation of independence. The General and Rosita met there and the next day, Sunday, July 29, San Martin returned the deference with another dance, now in the halls of the Palace of the Viceroys and saw again the beautiful Guayaquil. According to several testimonies Rosa and the General became lovers. When \\"the Protector\\" included her in the 112 women that received the Order of the Sun, the traditional society Lima considered it an affront. The day San Mart√≠n left Peru, they were barely able to say goodbye. By 1832 Rosita began a relationship with the German businessman John Weniger, owner of two valuable shoe stores on the St. Augustine silversmiths' street. They had a son named Alexander Weniger Campuzano, who she didn't raise because John took him when they ended their relationship. In Rosa's testament she claims that she was married to Ernesto Gaber, who left her by going off to Europe, and to have a son named Alexander. Rosa died almost in poverty in 1851, at age 55. She was buried in the church of San Juan Bautista de Lima. References  Bibliography  * Tradiciones peruanas completas, by Ricardo Palma, Compiled by Edith Palma.

She was married to Renato Curcio. Life She was born to a middle- class family in Sardagna, Trentino, in the north of Italy. Her mother was a pharmacist and her father a prosperous merchant, owner of a perfumery. In 1964 she enrolled in the faculty of Social Science at the University of Trento. She soon became involved with left-wing student movements, where she got to know Renato Curcio. They worked for the publication Lavoro Politico (Political Work). She graduated in 1969. She married Renato Curcio in a Catholic ceremony, after which the couple moved to Milan, where she intended to study for a further two years.l'Unit√† newspaper 07-06-1975, p. 5 In Milan, the Curcios became full-fledged terrorists. The Red Brigades were formed with Alberto Franceschini in the second half of 1970 as a result of the merger of Renato Curcio's Proletarian Left and a radical student and worker group. After getting arrested in February 1971 for occupying a vacant house, the Curcios and the most extreme members of the Proletarian Left went completely underground and organized the Red Brigades. They spent the next three years, from 1972 to 1975, engaging in a series of bombings and kidnappings of prominent figures. Renato Curcio was captured and jailed, but freed by Margherita in a raid on the prison five months later, on 18 February 1975. In April, Cagol, Mario Moretti and Renato Curcio met in a house near Piacenza to discuss their strategy. The organisation was growing and they needed further finance to continue their terrorist activities. They decided to follow the example of the South American guerrillas and carry out a series of kidnappings, one of the victims being the industrialist Vallarino Gancia. He was chosen because he was wealthy and lived in a region with which they were familiar. According to Renato Curcio, he had also financed a Fascist organization.Interview with Renato Curcio He was kidnapped on 4 June while on his way to his villa in Canelli, near Asti, bundled into a transporter, and taken to the farmhouse (Cascina Spiotta) on the hills of Acqui Terme. This farmhouse had been purchased some time before by Cagol, and had been used by members of the Red Brigades from Turin. Renato Curcio did not take part in the operation; as a prison escapee, his picture had been published all over Italy, and it was considered too dangerous. Cagol, along with a companion, were left to guard Gancia. Later that evening Cagol phoned Renato to tell him that the operation had been a success. The following morning the Carabinieri began investigating farmhouses in the neighbourhood. Cagol had been on watch during the night, and had gone to bed. Her companion, who took over the watch, fell asleep, and did not wake up until the Carabinieri started knocking at the door. Their escape route was blocked by the Carabinieri‚Äôs car, so they decided to fight it out. In the ensuing gunfight, two police officers were wounded and one was killed, as was Cagol. Renato Curcio was again captured by the authorities in January 1976, tried, convicted and imprisoned.See Giovanni Fasanella and Alberto Franceschini (with an afterword by judge Rosario Priore, who investigated Aldo Moro's death), Che cosa sono le BR (\\"Brigades Rouges.

Key objectives ITU-T Y.156sam is designed around three key objectives: * To serve as a network service level agreement (SLA) validation tool, ensuring that a service meets its guaranteed performance settings in a controlled test time * To ensure that all services carried by the network meet their SLA objectives at their maximum committed rate, proving that under maximum load network devices and paths can support all the traffic as designed * To perform medium- and long-term service testing, confirming that network element can properly carry all services while under stress during a soaking period Test methodology ITU-T Y.156sam defines an out-of-service test methodology to assess the proper configuration and performance of an Ethernet service prior to customer notification and delivery. The test methodology applies to point- to-point and point-to-multipoint connectivity in the Ethernet layer and to the network portions that provide, or contribute to, the provisioning of such services. This recommendation does not define Ethernet network architectures or services, but rather defines a methodology to test Ethernet-based services at the service activation stage. In particular, it is aimed at solving the deficiencies of RFC 2544 listed below. =Existing test methodologies: RFC 2544= The Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2544 is a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices. This request for comment (RFC) was created in 1999 as a methodology to benchmark network devices such as hubs, switches and routers as well as to provide accurate and comparable values for comparison and benchmarking. RFC 2544 provides engineers and network technicians with a common language and results format. The RFC 2544 describes six subtests: * Throughput: measures the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device/system under test (DUT/SUT). This measurement translates into the available bandwidth of the Ethernet virtual connection. * Back-to-back or burstability: measures the longest burst of frames at maximum throughput or minimum legal separation between frames that the device or network under test will handle without any loss of frames. This measurement is a good indication of the buffering capacity of a DUT. * Frame loss: defines the percentage of frames that should have been forwarded by a network device under steady state (constant) loads that were not forwarded due to lack of resources. This measurement can be used for reporting the performance of a network device in an overloaded state, as it can be a useful indication of how a device would perform under pathological network conditions such as broadcast storms. * Latency: measures the round-trip time taken by a test frame to travel through a network device or across the network and back to the test port. Latency is the time interval that begins when the last bit of the input frame reaches the input port and ends when the first bit of the output frame is seen on the output port. It is the time taken by a bit to go through the network and back. Latency variability can be a problem. With protocols like voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), a variable or long latency can cause degradation in voice quality. * System reset: measures the speed at which a DUT recovers from a hardware or software reset. This subtest is performed by measuring the interruption of a continuous stream of frames during the reset process. * System recovery: measures the speed at which a DUT recovers from an overload or oversubscription condition. This subtest is performed by temporarily oversubscribing the device under test and then reducing the throughput at normal or low load while measuring frame delay in these two conditions. The different between delay at overloaded condition and the delay and low load conditions represent the recovery time. =Drawbacks of RFC 2544= From a laboratory and benchmarking perspective, the RFC 2544 methodology is an ideal tool for automated measurement and reporting. From a service turn-up and troubleshooting perspective, RFC 2544, although acceptable and valid, does have some drawbacks: * Service providers are shifting from only providing Ethernet pipes to enabling services. Networks must support multiple services from multiple customers, and each service has its own performance requirements that must be met even under full load conditions and with all services being processed simultaneously. RFC 2544 was designed as a performance tool with a focus on a single stream to measure maximum performance of a DUT or network under test and was never intended for multiservice testing. * With RFC 2544‚Äôs focus on identifying the maximum performance of a device or network under test, the overall test time is variable and heavily depends on the quality of the link and subtest settings. RFC 2544 test cycles can easily require a few hours of testing. This is not an issue for lab testing or benchmarking, but becomes a serious issue for network operators with short service maintenance windows. * Packet delay variation is a key performance indicator (KPI) for real time services such as VoIP and Internet protocol television (IPTV) and is not measured by the RFC 2544 methodology. Network operators that performed service testing with RFC 2544 typically must execute external packet jitter testing outside of RFC 2544 as this KPI was not defined or measured by the RFC. * Testing is performed sequentially on one KPI after another. In multiservice environments, traffic is going to experience all KPIs at the same time, although throughput might be good, it can also be accompanied by very high latency due to buffering. Designed as a performance assessment tool, RFC 2544 measures each KPI individually through its subtest and therefore cannot immediately associate a very high latency with a good throughput, which should be cause for concern. Service definitions The ITU-T Y.156sam defines test streams with service attributes linked to the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) 10.2 definitions. Services are traffic streams with specific attributes identified by different classifiers such as 802.1q VLAN, 802.1ad and class of service (CoS) profiles. These services are defined at the UNI level with different frame and bandwidth profile such as the service‚Äôs maximum transmission unit (MTU) or frame size, committed information rate (CIR), and excess information rate (EIR). Test rates The ITU Y.156sam defines three key test rates based on the MEF service attributes for Ethernet virtual circuit (EVC) and user-to-network interface (UNI) bandwidth profiles. * CIR defines the maximum transmission rate for a service where the service is guaranteed certain performance objectives. These objectives are typically defined and enforced via SLAs. * EIR defines the maximum transmission rate above the committed information rate considered as excess traffic. This excess traffic is forwarded as capacity allows and is not subject to meeting any guaranteed performance objectives (best effort forwarding). * Overshoot rate defines a testing transmission rate above CIR or EIR and is used to ensure that the DUT or network under test does not forward more traffic than specified by the CIR or EIR of the service. =Color markings= These rates can be associated to color markings: * Green traffic is equivalent to CIR * Yellow traffic is equivalent to EIR * Red traffic represents discarded traffic (overshoot ‚Äì CIR or overshoot ‚Äì EIR). Subtests The ITU-T Y.156sam is built around two key subtests, the service configuration test and the service performance test, which are performed in order: =Service configuration test= Forwarding devices such as switches, routers, bridges and network interface units are the basis of any network as they interconnect segments. If a service is not correctly configured on any one of these devices within the end-to-end path, network performance can be greatly affected, leading to potential service outages and network-wide issues such as congestion and link failures. The Service configuration test measures the ability of DUT or network under test to properly forward in three different states: * In the CIR phase, where performance metrics for the service are measured and compared to the SLA performance objectives * In the EIR phase, where performance is not guaranteed and the services transfer rate is measured to ensure that CIR is the minimum bandwidth * In the discard phase, where the service is generated at the overshoot rate and the expected forwarded rate is not greater than the committed information rate or excess rate (when configured). =Service performance test= As network devices come under load, they must prioritize one traffic flow over another to meet the KPIs set for each traffic class. With only one traffic class, there is no prioritization performed by the network devices since there is only one set of KPIs. As the number of traffic flows increase, prioritization is necessary and performance failures may occur. The service performance test measures the ability of the DUT or network under test to forward multiple services while maintaining SLA conformance for each service. Services are generated at the CIR, where performance is guaranteed, and pass/fail assessment is performed on the KPI values for each service according to its SLA. Service performance assessment must also be maintained for a medium- to long-term period as performance degradation will likely occur as the network is under stress for longer period of times. The service performance test is designed to soak the network under full committed load for all services and measure performance over medium and long test time. Metrics The Y.156sam focuses on the following KPIs for service quality: * Bandwidth: this is a bit rate measure of available or consumed data communication resources expressed in bits/second or multiples of it (kilobits/s, megabits/s, etc.). * Frame transfer delay (FTD): also known as latency, this is a measurement of the time delay between the transmission and the reception of a frame. Typically this is a round-trip measurement, meaning that the calculation measures both the near-end to far- end and far-end to near-end direction simultaneously. * Frame delay variations: also known as packet jitter, this is a measurement of the variations in the time delay between packet deliveries. As packets travel through a network to their destination, they are often queued and sent in bursts to the next hop. There may be prioritization at random moments also resulting in packets being sent at random rates. Packets are therefore received at irregular intervals. The direct consequence of this jitter is stress on the receiving buffers of the end nodes where buffers can be overused or underused when there are large swings of jitter. * Frame loss: typically expressed as a ratio, this is a measurement of the number of packets lost over the total number of packets sent. Frame loss can be due to a number of issues such as network congestion or errors during transmissions.

Victims are primarily from the Chinese mainland, Mongolia, Russia, and Southeast Asia, with many of them from inland Chinese provinces who travel to the border province of Guangdong in search of better employment. There, they fall prey to false advertisements for jobs in casinos and other legitimate employment in Macau, but upon arrival, they are forced into prostitution. Foreign and mainland Chinese women are sometimes passed to local organized crime groups upon arrival, held captive, and forced into sexual servitude. Chinese, Russian, and Thai criminal syndicates are believed to sometimes be involved in bringing women into Macau‚Äôs commercial sex industry. Victims are sometimes confined in massage parlors and illegal brothels, where they are closely monitored, forced to work long hours, have their identity documents confiscated, and threatened with violence; all factors that make it particularly difficult for them to seek help. Macau is a source territory for women and girls who are subjected to forced prostitution elsewhere in Asia. The MSAR does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued efforts to raise awareness about trafficking amongst officials and the general public. Authorities convicted one trafficking offender during the past year. However, authorities identified far fewer victims during the reporting period than in the previous year and victim identification and protection efforts need to be further improved. Macau has the resources and government infrastructure to make greater strides in combating trafficking.\\"Macau\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Sex trafficking in Macau is an issue. Macau and foreign women and girls are forced into prostitution in brothels, homes, and businesses in the city. Prosecution Macau‚Äôs 2008 anti-trafficking legislation prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons and prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes. During the reporting period, authorities investigated six new trafficking cases. There were no cases of joint investigations between Macau authorities and foreign governments during the reporting period. In one ongoing investigation, law enforcement officials arrested six individuals who appeared to have been running a trafficking operation for over a decade. The syndicate was believed to have lured women to Macau by promising them jobs in massage parlors, and subsequently forcing them into prostitution upon arrival in the territory. Many cases investigated in 2008 were closed due to lack of evidence. In November 2009, Macau prosecutors convicted their first trafficking offender under the anti-trafficking law. A local man was sentenced to over seven years‚Äô imprisonment for his role in the trafficking of two female Macau residents to Japan in 2008. Corruption remains a serious problem in Macau, often linked to the gambling industry and organized crime networks. There were no reports of trafficking complicity by Macau officials during the reporting period One Macau police officer arrested in 2008 for allegedly blackmailing two women in prostitution for ‚Äòprotection‚Äô fees has still not been brought to trial. The involvement of international criminal syndicates in trafficking likely continued to challenge Macau‚Äôs law enforcement efforts. Protection Macau authorities demonstrated limited progress in its efforts to protect trafficking victims, particularly in the proactive identification of trafficking victims. Authorities identified six sex trafficking victims during the reporting period, a significant decrease from the 23 victims identified during the previous reporting period. Four victims were from mainland China, one from Vietnam, and one from Mongolia. Three victims stayed at a government shelter, and the other victims were repatriated to their home country at their request. Macau authorities proactively identified two of the six victims. The government did not report any efforts to identify trafficking cases amongst the more than 1,600 migrant workers who filed labor complaints in 2009. Victims identified by Macau authorities received counseling, medical care, and financial stipends while in the government shelter, but foreign victims are not offered legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. The government sustained an existing partnership with a local NGO in order to identify interpreters who could assist in cases involving foreign victims. The government should further improve efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims among individuals deported for immigration violations, including women in prostitution. The Women‚Äôs General Association of Macau continued to receive government funding to run a 24-hour trafficking victim assistance hotline. In November 2009, the government reached out to an international organization and funded a gathering of international experts in Macau to train 70 police, immigration, and social welfare officers on victim identification and protection. Macau officials also participated in regional anti-trafficking training run by a foreign donor. Prevention The MSAR government continued some efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. The government continued to display anti-trafficking brochures and posters in multiple languages at border checkpoints, hospitals, and popular public gathering areas. The Health Bureau installed television terminals to broadcast an MTV-produced trafficking video and local public service announcements on trafficking to be shown at health centers frequented by foreign workers. Authorities partnered with a local NGO to print 2,000 booklets featuring 55 anti-trafficking poster entries by secondary school students submitted for a recent NGO contest. The government did not take measures during the year to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or conduct any awareness efforts targeting clients of Macau‚Äôs prostitution industry.

Macedonian women and children are trafficked internally within the country. Women and girls from Albania, Bulgaria and Kosovo were reportedly subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor in Macedonia in 2009. Macedonian victims and victims transiting through Macedonia are subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor in South Central and Western Europe. Children, primarily ethnic Roma, are subjected to forced begging by their parents or other relatives. Girls were subjected to conditions of forced labor in Macedonian bars and nightclubs. A small number of Macedonian men were allegedly subjected to forced labor in Azerbaijan. Traffickers continued to operate in more hidden, private sectors in an attempt to conceal their exploitation of victims from law enforcement. The Government of Macedonia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued to strengthen its anti-trafficking framework and issued its first annual National Rapporteur‚Äôs report on trafficking. The government did not convict any trafficking offenders, identified fewer official trafficking victims, and did not provide funding to NGOs for the care and assistance of foreign and domestic trafficking victims in Macedonia. The government did not prosecute any officials for trafficking specific crimes, but took significant steps in fighting trafficking-related corruption.\\"Macedonia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Macedonia made limited progress in its law enforcement response to human trafficking during the reporting period. The government prohibits sex and labor trafficking through Article 418(a) and (d) of its 2004 criminal code. In 2009, the government arrested 18 suspects for trafficking- related offenses and opened investigations of seven trafficking cases, of which five are ongoing. In the other two cases, the public prosecutor indicted and began prosecution in 2009. The government did not convict any trafficking offenders during the reporting period. In September 2009, the government adopted amendments to its criminal code that require a minimum sentence of eight years‚Äô imprisonment for any public official convicted of a trafficking offense committed while in the course of official duty. The government investigated and prosecuted corruption in certain sectors of law enforcement, which posed challenges to anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling efforts during the reporting period. The government reported evidence of immigration officials‚Äô forging residency documents of potential trafficking victims in 2009. The government did not prosecute or convict any officials for complicity specific to trafficking during the reporting period; however, it convicted 60 border police for soliciting bribes and, in a separate case, convicted one official of smuggling migrants in 2009. Protection The Government of Macedonia did not demonstrate sufficient progress in protecting trafficking victims in 2009. Macedonia's victim identification procedures require that first-line responders liberally identify people, such as illegal migrants and foreign women and girls in prostitution, as potential victims until they can be formally vetted by a trained anti-trafficking authority. Of the 157 potential trafficking victims identified by authorities in 2009, seven were confirmed as trafficking victims; all were children. Eighteen victims were identified in 2008. With IOM assistance, the government organized a series of trainings reaching 280 front-line responders on proactive victim identification. These trainings were funded with the government's EU pre- accession funds, earmarked for trafficking. Additionally, in conjunction with the OSCE, the government trained all of the country's labor inspectors on proactive victim identification in the labor sector. Macedonian law exempts victims from criminal prosecution for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. While the government's standard operating procedures mandate a multi-disciplinary approach to identifying victims, NGOs and international organizations should be more systematically included in this process. The government continued to fund and operate a transit center for foreign migrants and trafficking victims with the help of a local NGO that specializes in victim rehabilitation, especially children. The government provided in-kind contributions to the NGO assisting foreign victims in this center. All potential victims are offered a two-month reflection period during which time they are offered victim assistance services, regardless of whether they choose to testify for the state. At any time during the reflection period, if they decide to cooperate with authorities in the investigation of the crime, an additional six-month residency permit can be granted. As an undocumented foreigner, until a foreign trafficking victim receives a legal residency status, his or her movement is restricted to within the shelter. During the reporting period, one foreign victim stayed in the transit center under the reflection period. No foreign victims to date have requested the six-month residency permit. The largest Macedonian NGO providing protection and assistance to domestic trafficking victims continued to rely primarily on international donors to provide victims with both immediate and long-term comprehensive services for their rehabilitation and reintegration. Victims also received reintegration support from Macedonia's 30 social welfare centers located throughout the country. The government provided significant funding to these centers, which are not focused exclusively on helping trafficking victims and, according to NGOs, lack the capacity to fully address the complex and comprehensive needs of domestic trafficking victims. These centers assisted seven trafficking victims in 2009, the same number assisted in 2008. Aware of this problem, the government is in the process of refurbishing a domestic shelter that will house domestic victims of trafficking. In 2009, the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy succeeded in obtaining funding from the national budget for operation of a domestic shelter. Although the government drafted legislation to ensure that domestic trafficking victims receive free healthcare, a lack of implementation of this provision resulted in an NGO paying for some victims‚Äô emergency medical care in 2009. During the reporting period, the government took over complete financial responsibility for the National Referral Mechanism Office, a coordinating body responsible for monitoring victim identification, referral, assistance, and legal processes. Macedonian law provides legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face retribution or hardship through both a two- month reflection period and a six-month residency permit. The government encouraged victims to participate in the prosecution of their traffickers; it reported that three victims provided witness testimony in courts and three assisted in law enforcement investigations in 2009. Reportedly, one of the reasons victims do not report their traffickers is because the traffickers tell the victims they have connections with the police. Prevention The Government of Macedonia made progress in its anti-trafficking prevention efforts. In January 2010, the government's newly appointed National Rapporteur published Macedonia's first annual report on trafficking, which also covered migrant smuggling. The report was presented to the stakeholders, the international community, and NGOs for comment, but the final product lacked a comprehensive assessment of anti-trafficking efforts in Macedonia and contained cursory recommendations for improvement. The government continued to rely on NGOs and international organizations to assist in conducting many of its anti-trafficking prevention programs; it forged partnerships with NGOs to distribute general anti-trafficking leaflets in specified locations and schools throughout 2009. It also translated IOM's ‚ÄúBuy Responsibly‚Äù campaign and in November 2009 began broadcasting it over state television as part of a campaign to target client demand for products potentially resulting from labor trafficking. The government continued seminars in the University of Skopje and collaborated with another NGO on a series of workshops that addressed client demand for victims of sex trafficking. It also provided $1,000 to an NGO to conduct trafficking prevention lectures to youth around the country in 2009. In September 2009, the government formally adopted its 2009-2012 National Action Plan on trafficking, and for the first time budgeted specific funding for the plan's implementation.

An estimated 6,000 Malagasy women are currently employed as domestic workers in Lebanon, with a smaller number in Kuwait. Many of these women come from rural areas and are often illiterate or poorly educated, making them more vulnerable to deception and abuse at the hands of recruitment agencies and employers. Detailed information regarding situations of forced labor and other abuses experienced by Malagasy domestic workers in Lebanon came to light during the year. Numerous trafficking victims returning to Madagascar reported harsh working conditions, physical violence, sexual harassment and assault, confinement to the home, confiscation of travel documents, and withholding of salaries. Eight deaths were reported among this population in 2009. Children, mostly from rural areas, are subject to conditions of domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor in mining, fishing, and agriculture within the country. Most child trafficking occurs with the involvement of family members, but friends, transport operators, tour guides, and hotel workers also facilitate the enslavement of children. A child sex tourism problem exists in coastal cities, including Tamatave, Nosy Be, and Diego Suarez, as well as the capital city of Antananarivo; some children are recruited for work in the capital using fraudulent offers of employment as waitresses and maids before being forced into the commercial sex trade on the coast. The main sources of child sex tourists are France, Germany, and Switzerland. Parents sell young women into marriages, some of which are short- term, often for significant sums of money. The Government of Madagascar does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Since the March 2009 coup, combating human trafficking has received little attention in Madagascar; the recent focus on the abuse of domestic workers in Lebanon has not resulted in any commensurate governmental response to the problem. The government's anti-trafficking efforts were insufficient and decreased during the year ‚Äì especially in the areas of prosecuting trafficking offenders, identifying and protecting victims, and raising public awareness of the problem ‚Äì while the prevalence of officials' complicity in human trafficking became more evident. Lack of political will, institutional capacity, and relevant training remained significant impediments to improved anti- trafficking performance, particularly impacting the effectiveness of law enforcement activities; the government failed to investigate or prosecute traffickers in 2009. Therefore, Madagascar is placed on Tier 2 Watch List.\\"Madagascar\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Malagasy government's anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts diminished over the years, as it reported no investigations or prosecutions of trafficking offenders. Anti-Trafficking Law No. 2007-038 prohibits all forms of human trafficking, though it only prescribes punishments for sex trafficking; these range from two years' to life imprisonment, penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 262 of the Labor Code criminalizes labor trafficking, for which it prescribes inadequate penalties of one to three years' imprisonment. Decree 2007-563 prohibits and prescribes minimal punishments of up to two years' imprisonment for various forms of child trafficking, including prostitution, domestic servitude, and forced labor. The government has yet to use its anti-trafficking law to punish traffickers. Poor coordination among ministries, a lack of data sharing between officials at regional and national levels, and the lack of a presidential decree codifying and mandating its use at the provincial level hindered the law's implementation. The government did not investigate or prosecute cases of forced labor during the reporting period. The Government of Madagascar nominally suspended the work of several employment agencies implicated in human trafficking during the year, but did not follow through on its commitment to conduct inspections of these businesses. In November 2009, the government instituted a ban on sending workers to Lebanon, but it was poorly implemented, possibly due to complicity of high-ranking government officials; up to 10 labor recruitment agencies were reportedly owned by civil servants in the Ministry of Labor. Government officials also reportedly assist unlicensed recruitment agencies in obtaining fraudulent travel documents. Anecdotal evidence indicates there was also official complicity in permitting organized child prostitution rings to operate, particularly in Nosy Be. Local police remained hesitant to pursue child sex trafficking and child sex tourism offenses, possibly because of deep-rooted corruption, pressures from the local community, or fear of an international incident. The government took no action against official complicity in human trafficking during the reporting period. Protection The Malagasy government made weak efforts to ensure that victims were provided access to necessary services and it did not operate specific victim assistance programs. The majority of trafficking victims identified in 2009 were assisted by NGO-run centers. Madagascar lacks procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations or refer victims for care. However, the Ministry of Health's local-level Child Rights Protection Networks ‚Äì which grew through a partnership with UNICEF to include 761 communes in 2009 ‚Äì brought together government institutions, law enforcement, and NGOs to partially fill this role. These networks coordinated child protection activities, identified and reported abuse cases, and assisted some trafficking victims in accessing social and legal services. Victims who returned from Lebanon were immediately confined to a psychiatric institution and not provided with appropriate social or legal services. Madagascar's honorary consul in Beirut made limited attempts to mediate with labor agencies and refer Malagasy victims to a Beirut-based NGO shelter. The government sent an official from its embassy in Paris to Beirut to research the abuse of Malagasy domestic workers in Lebanon, but did not take measures to initiate bilateral engagement with the Government of Lebanon regarding protection of and legal remedies for exploited workers. The government did not penalize trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked, but did not show evidence that it encouraged them to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their exploiters. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution. Prevention The government's efforts to prevent trafficking decreased during the year, particularly in the area of public awareness raising. The President's Inter-Ministerial Anti-Trafficking Committee ceased functioning in early 2009. The government's Antananarivo- based Manjary Soa Center withdrew an unknown number of children from the worst forms of child labor and provided them with education or vocational training. Two additional centers opened in Toliara and Toamasina in 2009 and were the only programs fully funded by the government to combat child labor. Although nine Regional Committees to Fight Child Labor worked to increase coordination among government entities, NGOs, and ILO/IPEC under the framework of the National Action Plan for the Fight Against Child Labor, the Ministry of Labor's five child labor inspectors were insufficient to cover areas beyond Antananarivo or in informal economic sectors. The ministry conducted no complaint-driven child labor inspections and provided no information on incidences of child labor, if any, uncovered during regular inspections. The government continued to distribute to arriving international passengers fliers and a customs booklet containing a full-page warning of the consequences of child sex tourism. In 2009, the government charged a French national with rape and corruption of a minor after he paid for sex acts with several young girls.

Most Malawian trafficking victims are exploited internally, though Malawian victims of sex and labor trafficking have also been identified in South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and parts of Europe. To a lesser extent, Malawi is a transit point for foreign victims and a destination country for men, women, and children from Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe subjected to conditions of forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. Within the country, some children are forced into domestic servitude, cattle herding, agricultural labor, and menial work in various small businesses. Exploited girls and women become \\"bar girls\\" at local bars and rest houses where they are coerced to have sex with customers in exchange for room and board. Forced labor in agriculture is often found on tobacco plantations. Labor traffickers are often villagers who have moved to urban areas and subsequently recruit children from their original villages through offers of good jobs. Brothel owners or other prostitution facilitators lure girls with promises of nice clothing and lodging. Upon arrival, they charge the girl high rental fees for these items and instruct her how to engage in prostitution to pay off the debt. South African and Tanzanian long- distance truck drivers and mini-bus operators move victims across porous borders by avoiding immigration checkpoints. Some local businesswomen who also travel regularly to neighboring countries to buy clothing for import have been identified as traffickers. Reports of European tourists paying for sex with teenage boys and girls continue. The Government of Malawi does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. While the government maintained its efforts to ensure victims' access to protective services and prevent trafficking, adults trafficked for sex or labor exploitation and children exploited in domestic servitude and prostitution still did not receive the same amount of care as children exploited in forced labor.\\"Malawi\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Malawi maintained its progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the last year. Malawi prohibits all forms of trafficking through various laws, including the Employment Act and Articles 135 through 147 and 257 through 269 of the Penal Code, though the country lacks specific anti- trafficking laws. The penalties prescribed under these statutes range from small fines to 10 years' imprisonment; these penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes. For a second year, the draft Child Care, Protection and Justice Bill, which defines child trafficking and imposes a penalty of life imprisonment for convicted traffickers, remained in the government's Cabinet and was not passed by Parliament. Also for a second year, the Malawi Law Commission did not complete drafting comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation specifically outlawing all forms of human trafficking. Local law enforcement agencies in Malawi only keep written record of their activities, which are not consolidated at any central record facility. Data on nationwide statistics was not available, though some individual districts provided data on their specific activities. In 2009, the Magistrate's Court in the district of Mchinji on the Zambian border prosecuted five trafficking offenders on criminal charges and convicted four. In one case involving 14 child victims of labor trafficking, three offenders were sentenced to seven years of hard labor, one was fined $33, and one was acquitted. The Mchinji court convicted a trafficker caught while transporting 59 children to Zambia to be exploited in forced labor, and sentenced him to five years in prison. The government also prosecuted and convicted 34 trafficking offenders for exploiting children in forced farm labor. Each was fined $131, which is approximately one-third of the average annual income in Malawi. Police, child protection, social welfare, and other officials received training in how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking either directly from the government or in partnership with NGOs. The Ministry of Labor incorporated a child protection curriculum into labor inspector training. Requests to work with other governments are handled on an ad hoc, informal basis, especially between district officials in Mchinji and officials across the Zambian border. The Anti-Corruption Bureau's investigation, begun in 2007, into two complaints of government corruption relating to trafficking was ongoing at the end of the reporting period. Protection The Malawi government maintained its efforts to ensure that victims were provided access to appropriate services, and provided in-kind support to NGO service providers. Malawi continued to depend heavily on foreign donors and NGOs to fund and operate most of the country's anti-trafficking programs. This past year, it provided technical and coordination assistance to NGOs and helped set project guidelines. In Dedza district, police rescued 14 Malawian and 10 Mozambican child victims of labor trafficking. The government provided law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel with basic training in identifying victims of trafficking, though it has not yet established systematic procedures for proactively identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, especially persons in the commercial sex trade. Government personnel sustained partnerships with NGOs to connect their local programs with government labor inspectors, child protection officers, district social welfare officers, the police, and district child protection committees. The government funded one rehabilitation drop-in center in Lilongwe for victims of trafficking and gender-based violence. The center did not keep specific records of trafficking victims that it may have assisted. Over 100 police stations throughout the country housed victim support units to respond to gender-based violence and trafficking crimes. These units provided limited counseling and, in some places, temporary shelter, though the capacity to identify and assist victims varied greatly among stations. Inter-ministerial child protection committees monitored their districts for suspicious behavior which might indicate trafficking activity. Overall, the government encouraged victims' participation in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes and did not inappropriately incarcerate, fine, or otherwise penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The government sustained its efforts to prevent human trafficking and raise public awareness of the crime in 2009. An inter-ministerial task force on human trafficking, led by the Ministry of Gender, Child Development and Community Development, forged a partnership with international organizations and NGOs and began drafting a national plan of action which is not yet complete. Addressing child trafficking is also the responsibility of both the National Steering Committee on Orphans and Vulnerable Children and the National Steering Committee on Child Labor. Uneven levels of expertise and inadequate inter-agency coordination at national and district levels interfered with the effectiveness of these committees in preventing child trafficking. Through the National Aids Commission's Action Framework on HIV/AIDS Prevention, the government sensitized communities to the dangers of commercial sexual exploitation and attempted to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The Malawi Defense Force provided training on human rights, child protection, and the elimination of sexual exploitation to its nationals deployed abroad as part of peacekeeping missions.

The majority of trafficking victims are foreign workers who migrate willingly to Malaysia from Indonesia, Nepal, India, Thailand, China, the Philippines, Burma, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam in search of greater economic opportunities, some of whom subsequently encounter forced labour or debt bondage at the hands of their employers, employment agents, or informal labour recruiters.  Overview  While many of Malaysia's trafficking offenders are individual businessmen, large organised crime syndicates are also behind some of the trafficking of foreigners in Malaysia. A significant number of young women are recruited for work in Malaysian restaurants and hotels, some of whom migrate through the use of ‚ÄúGuest Relations Officer‚Äù visas, but subsequently are coerced into Malaysia's commercial sex trade. Such women from China are nicknamed \\"China Dolls\\". Many Malaysian labour outsourcing companies apparently recruited excess workers, who were then often subject to conditions of forced labour. Some Malaysian citizens are trafficked internally and abroad to Singapore, Hong Kong, France, and the United Kingdom for commercial sexual exploitation. There were approximately two million documented migrant workers in Malaysia in 2009, and an additional estimated 1.9 million who were undocumented. Many migrant workers in plantations, construction sites, textile factories, and employed as domestic workers throughout Malaysia experienced restrictions on movement, deceit and fraud in wages, passport confiscation, or debt bondage, which are practices indicative of trafficking. Some Malaysian employers reportedly did not pay their foreign domestic workers three to six months‚Äô wages to recoup recruitment agency charges, making them vulnerable to trafficking. Refugees were particularly vulnerable to trafficking, and Malaysians from rural communities and indigenous groups were also vulnerable. The People's Volunteer Corps (RELA) continued to conduct raids targeting illegal migrant communities and detained refugees, asylum seekers, and trafficking victims along with allegedly illegal migrants and foreign prostitutes. Some trafficking victims were locked up in warehouses or brothels. The Indonesian and Malaysian governments have not amended or replaced a 2006 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covering the employment of Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia, which authorises Malaysian employers to confiscate and hold the passports of domestic employees. The Government of Malaysia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Because the assessment that the government had made significant efforts is based in part on its commitments to undertake actions over the coming year ‚Äì notably greater implementation of Malaysia's anti-trafficking law against labour trafficking ‚Äì U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. The Malaysian government has shown a greater commitment to address human trafficking that is expected to lead to: increased investigations and prosecutions of labour trafficking offences and identification of labour trafficking victims; increasing efforts to prosecute trafficking-related corruption by government officials; and greater collaboration with NGOs and international organizations to improve victim services in government shelters. During the reporting period, senior government officials, including the Prime Minister, publicly acknowledged Malaysia's human trafficking problem, the government increased its investigations of trafficking cases and filed an increased number of criminal charges against traffickers, significantly expanded training of officials on the 2007 anti-trafficking law, conducted a public awareness campaign on human trafficking, opened three more shelters for trafficking victims, and launched a five-year national action plan on trafficking. Nevertheless, these early efforts will require continued attention, as there are many serious concerns remaining regarding trafficking in Malaysia, including the detention of trafficking victims in government facilities.\\"Malaysia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (14 June 2010). Prosecution The Government of Malaysia made some progress in law enforcement efforts against sex trafficking during the reporting period, and limited progress in prosecuting and convicting offenders of labour trafficking. Malaysian law prohibits all forms of human trafficking through its 2007 anti-trafficking law, which prescribes penalties that are commensurate with those of other serious offences, such as rape. During the reporting period, the government convicted three sex trafficking offenders and reported initiating 180 trafficking-related investigations and filing 123 charges against 69 individuals, though it is unclear how many of these cases were for actual trafficking. In January 2010, authorities identified their first labour trafficking case in the fisheries industry when the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency intercepted Thai fishing boats off the coast of Sarawak and arrested five Thai traffickers; the case remains pending. While NGOs reported several potential labour trafficking cases to the government, authorities did not report any related arrests or investigations. Authorities initiated a review of the licenses of the 277 companies that are authorised to act as labour recruiters in Malaysia. The government did not report any criminal prosecutions of employers who subjected workers to conditions of forced labour or labour recruiters who used deceptive practices and debt bondage to compel migrant workers into involuntary servitude. Despite a public statement by a senior official highlighting the right of workers to hold their own passports, the government continued to allow for the confiscation of passports by employers of migrant workers, and did not prosecute any employers who confiscated passports or travel documents of migrant workers or confined them to the workplace. In September 2009, the Home Minister announced that a new MOU being negotiated between Malaysia and Indonesia would not allow confiscation of passports of migrant workers, but the 2006 MOU authorising such confiscation has not yet been amended or replaced. Authorities did not take criminal action against Peoples Volunteer Corps (RELA) volunteers who physically threatened and abused migrant workers and extorted money from them, despite continued reports of these abuses. In response to credible reports of government officials‚Äô direct involvement in a human trafficking network along the Malaysia-Thailand border outlined in a US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report, five immigration officials were arrested for alleged involvement in a trafficking ring that took Burmese migrants to Thailand for sale to trafficking syndicates. However, officials have only lodged criminal charges under the Anti-Trafficking Act against one of the officers, and the case against him is still pending. Some observers report that corruption plays a role in the trafficking of foreign migrant workers, particularly with regard to officials‚Äô authorising excess recruitment by Malaysian outsourcing companies, despite assurances from officials that practice had been reduced by regulations implemented in July 2009 that require outsourcing companies to demonstrate their need for each worker recruited. Reports also indicate that collusion between police and trafficking offenders sometimes leads to offenders escaping arrest and punishment. Nevertheless, there were no officials convicted of trafficking-related complicity during the reporting period. Protection The government made minimal progress in protecting victims of trafficking during the reporting period. Efforts to identify and protect both sex and labour trafficking victims remained inadequate overall. The government did not report the identification of any Malaysian victims of trafficking. In January, officials rescued and identified 16 male forced labour victims from four deep-sea trawlers off the coast of Sarawak ‚Äì the first trafficking victims in the fisheries industry identified by the government. The Ministry for Women, Family, and Community Development continued to run two trafficking ‚Äúshelters‚Äù for women and children and opened a third in July 2009, which detained suspected and confirmed foreign sex trafficking victims involuntarily for 90 days until they were deported to their home countries, per Malaysian law. During the reporting period, the government also opened its first two shelters designed to house male victims of trafficking, although these shelters also detained victims involuntarily until they were deported. The government's policy of detaining trafficking victims against their will provided a disincentive for victims and their advocates from bringing cases to the government's attention. During the reporting period, 139 women and children were certified as victims and detained in the shelters. An additional 232 individuals were given initial protective orders, but were ultimately determined by the government to not be victims of trafficking and were deported, though officials acknowledge that some of these may have been trafficking victims who were reluctant to co- operate with law enforcement proceedings. During the year, the government reportedly made some improvements in its screening to identify individuals possessing UNHCR cards or possessing traits of trafficking victims to separate them from the illegal migrant populations. The government continued to use RELA volunteers in indiscriminate raids to identify illegal migrants, some of whom were reportedly trafficking victims. Several foreign embassies reported that they were sometimes not informed by Malaysian authorities of the presence of their nationals in trafficking shelters, and at times, authorities would deny these diplomatic missions access to their citizens once their presence was known. Government shelters resembled immigration detention centres, by denying victims basic freedoms, and these facilities did not employ medical officers, trained psychologists, or trained victim counselors. Some victims were locked in rooms within the shelters. While NGO trafficking shelters provide resources that government shelters do not, the government does not provide any financial assistance to NGOs, and requires all identified victims to reside in its own shelters. The anti-trafficking law provides immunity to trafficking victims for immigration offences such as illegal entry, unlawful presence, and possession of false travel documents, but victims continue to be detained and deported, as they would be if they were arrested for illegal immigration. Malaysian law does not provide immunity for criminal acts committed as a result of being trafficked. In January 2010, a 14-year-old Indonesian girl working as a domestic worker in Malaysia was identified by authorities as a trafficking victim. Authorities prosecuted the girl for theft from her employer, and did not prosecute the girl's employer for violating child labour laws. The government issued guidelines and provided training on the identification and processing of suspected trafficking victims, but did not develop or implement formal procedures to proactively identify victims of labour trafficking. The government treated victims of trafficking as illegal aliens and turned them over to immigration authorities for deportation after they provided evidence to prosecutors. Victims are required by law to assist in the prosecution of trafficking offenders, but the lack of victim protection or any incentives for victim assistance in investigations and prosecutions remained a significant impediment to successful prosecutions. Aside from a standard 90-day stay in one of its shelters, the government did not provide other legal alternatives to the removal of victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Although victims may file a civil suit against exploiters, their lack of any option to legally work during the consideration of their suit discouraged such attempts. Some foreign governments expressed concern about the lack of legal protections in place for foreign workers in Malaysia, particularly those subjected to involuntary servitude. Some unidentified victims, including children, were routinely processed as illegal migrants and held in prisons or immigration detention centres prior to deportation. Prevention Malaysia made some efforts to prevent trafficking in persons over the last year. The government conducted numerous anti- trafficking training events for Malaysian police, immigration, prosecutors, labour department officials, and Women's ministry officials, and began to partner with NGOs, international organisations, and foreign governments on such training. In November 2009, the government launched an anti-trafficking public awareness campaign that included advertisements in print media, on the radio, and on television, including television appearances by senior government officials to discuss human trafficking. In March 2010, the government launched a five-year action plan to combat trafficking. The government began to use its ‚Äú999‚Äù emergency number as a trafficking hotline where calls are routed to the Malaysian Police, though calls can only be taken in Malay and English. The Women's Ministry produced pamphlets to potential trafficking victims in nine languages, which the Immigration Department began to distribute. The Indonesian and Malaysian governments have yet to amend or replace a 2006 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covering the employment of Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia, which authorises Malaysian employers to confiscate and hold the passports of domestic employees, though negotiations to do so continued through the reporting period. According to the United States, Malaysia is not doing enough to curtail human trafficking. In June 2014 in its annual Trafficking in Persons report, the United States said it had lowered Malaysia's ranking to Tier 3, the lowest grade possible.

Some women are also subjected to forced prostitution. An unknown number of the 110,000 foreign workers currently working in the Maldives ‚Äì primarily in the construction and service sectors ‚Äì face fraudulent recruitment practices, confiscation of identity and travel documents, withholding or non-payment of wages, or debt bondage. Thirty thousand of these workers do not have legal status in the country, though both legal and illegal workers were vulnerable to conditions of forced labor. Diplomatic sources estimate that half of the 35,000 Bangladeshis in the Maldives went there illegally and that most of these workers are probably victims of trafficking. Migrant workers pay $1,000 to $4,000 in recruitment fees in order to migrate to the Maldives; such high recruitment costs increase workers‚Äô vulnerability to forced labor, as concluded in a recent ILO report. A small number of women from Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, China, the Philippines, Eastern Europe, and former Soviet Union countries are recruited for forced prostitution in Mal√©, the capital. A small number of underage Maldivian girls reportedly are trafficked to Male from other islands for involuntary domestic servitude; this is a corruption of the widely acknowledged practice where families send Maldivian girls to live with a host family in Male for educational purposes. Trafficking offenders usually fall into three groups: families that subject domestic servants to forced labor; employment agents who bring low-skilled migrant workers to the Maldives under false terms of employment and upon payment of high fees; and employers who subject the migrants to conditions of forced labor upon arrival. The Government of the Maldives does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government lacks systematic procedures for identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, and during the reporting period it did not investigate or prosecute trafficking-related offenses or take concrete actions to protect trafficking victims and prevent trafficking in the Maldives. Therefore, the Maldives is placed on Tier 2 Watch List. After 30 years of one-party rule, the new government ‚Äì formed in 2009 ‚Äì is continuing to build the institutions of democratic governance.\\"Maldives\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Prosecution The Government of the Maldives undertook limited anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the last year. Although the Maldives does not have laws prohibiting human trafficking offenses, its constitution prohibits forced labor and slavery. The only prescribed penalty for labor trafficking offenses is a fine. The government did not investigate or prosecute any trafficking cases. The Labor Tribunal, created as part of the 2008 Employment Act, heard eight cases involving foreign workers whose wages had not been paid ‚Äî a possible indicator of forced labor ‚Äî but the tribunal lacked legal authority to enforce its decision. In addition, employment tribunal members and employees expressed concerns about their ability to resolve cases involving foreign workers because all their proceedings were conducted in the local language. Protection The Maldivian government made limited efforts to ensure that victims of trafficking received access to necessary assistance during the reporting period. The government did not develop or implement formal procedures for proactively identifying victims, and the government did not identify any specific cases of trafficking or provide an estimate of the number of victims. Officers with the Maldivian Police and the Department of Immigration and Emigration have received training in the recognition of trafficking victims. The Maldives did not provide services such as shelter, counseling, medical care, or legal aid to foreign or Maldivian victims of trafficking. On an ad hoc basis, it provided extremely short-term housing for migrants immediately before deportation. The government‚Äôs general policy for dealing with trafficking victims was deportation, and it did not provide foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they might face hardship or retribution. Authorities did not encourage victims to participate in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking offenders, since no investigations or prosecutions took place. Due to a lack of comprehensive victim identification procedures, the Maldives may not have ensured that expatriates subjected to forced labor and prostitution were not inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficking. Prevention The Maldives made limited progress to prevent human trafficking over the last year. The government did not conduct any anti-trafficking or educational campaigns and it did not take steps to create an inter-agency structure ‚Äì such as a committee or plan of action ‚Äì for coordination on anti-trafficking matters. The government did not take any measures to reduce demand for forced labor on the islands. In 2010, the Maldives enacted a provision in the 2008 Employment Act requiring all employers to use employment agents. The Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, a constitutionally-established independent body, published a report in August 2009 that contained strong trafficking-related recommendations including prosecutions for forced labor offenders and regulations of recruitment agencies. In February 2010, the Ministry of Home Affairs‚Äô Department of Immigration and Emigration prominently posted on its website a readout of bilateral discussions on trafficking. Senior government officials recently attended the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation‚Äôs convention on trafficking, which focused on sex trafficking.

Within Mali, women and girls are forced into domestic servitude and, to a limited extent, prostitution. Malian boys are found in conditions of forced begging and forced labor in gold mines and agricultural settings both within Mali and neighboring countries. Reports indicate that Malian children are trafficked to Senegal and Guinea for forced labor in gold mines and for forced labor on cotton and cocoa farms in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Boys from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger and other countries are forced into begging and exploited for labor by religious instructors within Mali and across borders. Adult men and boys, primarily of Songhai ethnicity, are subjected to the longstanding practice of debt bondage in the salt mines of Taoudenni in northern Mali. Some members of Mali's black Tamachek community are subjected to traditional slavery-related practices rooted in hereditary master-slave relationships. The Government of Mali does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, such as assisting with the identification and rescue of 80 child trafficking victims and drafting new anti-trafficking legislation, the government failed to show evidence of progress in prosecuting and convicting trafficking offenders, and did not take action on five pending cases of traditional slavery. Therefore, Mali is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year.\\"Mali\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Prosecution The Government of Mali demonstrated limited law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the last year. Mali does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, though Article 244 of the criminal code prohibits all forms of child trafficking. Conviction of child trafficking carries a penalty of from five to 20 years' imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and comparable with penalties for sexual assault. Article 229 of the criminal code criminalizes the sexual exploitation of children and forced prostitution of adult women. Malian law may not adequately criminalize other forms of trafficking. Criminal Code Article 242, passed in 1973, prohibits individuals from entering into agreements or contracts that deprive third parties of their liberty: NGOs argue that this law, which has sometimes been characterized as an anti-slavery law, is inadequate to prosecute cases of hereditary slavery. In November 2009, the Malian government participated in a conference organized by a leading anti-slavery NGO to introduce draft anti- slavery legislation to civil society organizations, and officials plan to introduce a separate law outlawing all forms of trafficking to the Malian legislature later in 2010. During the reporting period, the government made two arrests for human trafficking offenses: in both cases, the suspected traffickers were released without trial. Malian authorities reported no prosecutions or convictions of trafficking offenders. On two occasions in 2009, one suspected trafficking offender was taken into custody by Malian authorities with trafficked children in his possession as he attempted to leave the country: on both occasions, he was released with no explanation. A trial date has not yet been set for three individuals arrested in March 2008 for allegedly trafficking two Malian and 24 Guinean children to Mali from Guinea; they were released in June pending trial. Six cases of traditional enslavement remained pending in Malian courts and judicial authorities have taken no discernible action to prosecute these cases to completion in a criminal court. In one case, however, local authorities responded to an NGO request to discuss an amicable resolution, though this is not an adequate response to an alleged crime of slavery. One of these cases involves a black Tamachek child taken from his parents in Kidal in September 2007 by an individual claiming traditional ownership rights over the child; the child remains in the custody of this traditional master. During the reporting period, the government provided no training on human trafficking investigations or legislation to Malian law enforcement and judicial officials. Authorities collaborated with the governments of Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mauritania to secure the repatriation of trafficking victims. There were no reports of official complicity in human trafficking. Some officials may not perceive certain kinds of trafficking, such as forced begging at the order of Koranic teachers, as egregious human trafficking offenses, thereby impeding some trafficking investigations. Traditional conflict mediation was favored over the rule of law in some cases of child trafficking and exploitation. In several cases, for example, authorities released religious teachers suspected of forcing children to beg after it was determined that the teacher had the parents' permission to take the child. Protection The Government of Mali demonstrated moderate efforts to protect trafficking victims in the last year. Authorities did not report a formal system for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as child laborers. Due to its limited resources, the government did not operate any victim shelters or provide direct aid to victims. Instead, it referred victims to NGOs and international organizations for assistance, and provided in-kind support to these organizations in the form of land or buildings. Authorities reported assisting 80 child victims of trafficking during 2009. The government did not report assisting any victims of traditional slavery. Most cases of trafficking identified by NGOs are reported to the government, and an official from the Ministry for the Advancement of Women, Children, and the Family coordinates the process of repatriation with a counterpart in the government of the victim's country of origin. During the reporting period, officials interviewed victims in one suspected child trafficking case and also interviewed one victim of traditional slavery. Mali does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. Identified victims are not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. While the Malian government stated that it has developed a system for collecting data on trafficking crimes and the number of victims identified, officials have not made this system public. Prevention The Government of Mali made limited efforts to prevent trafficking, through awareness-raising or other means, during the last year. A regional government office in the zone with the higher prevalence of forced agricultural labor operated a public awareness campaign on child trafficking and child labor. Many government officials do not acknowledge that hereditary slavery exists in Mali. During the reporting period, the National Steering Committee Against Child Labor, which is composed of 43 government, NGO, and international organization members, reported no actions and suffered from poor interagency communication. However, the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and Children created a more streamlined committee to combat trafficking, and the Malian government decided to introduce a law criminalizing all forms of trafficking in 2010. The government took no visible measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.

During this reporting period and in the past, the Maltese media also covered possible cases of Maltese teenage girls who may have been involved in forced prostitution in Malta. Malta is likely a destination country for men subjected to forced labor as reflected by a report in 2009 that three Pakistani males were forced to work in Pakistani restaurants in Malta. The dozens of children and 4,304 total irregular migrants currently residing in Malta from African countries may be vulnerable to human trafficking in Malta‚Äôs ‚Äúgrey‚Äù informal labor market.\\"Malta\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Malta does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government did not demonstrate progress in convicting and punishing trafficking offenders, or in identifying and ensuring the protection of trafficking victims during the reporting period. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. General Information The government of Malta has attempted to combat human trafficking through several initiatives, including the development of victim assistance services, training of government officials, and raising of public awareness. Malta has experienced a limited number of cases of human trafficking, all of which involved the sexual exploitation of women. The victims were mainly third-country nationals from Eastern Europe, including in particular Russia and the Ukraine, who had entered Malta through legal channels. Only one case involved the sexual exploitation of an EU national. The cases encountered so far did not involve organized crime networks. No new cases of human trafficking were encountered during 2009 and 2010, although a new case has been brought before the Courts this year. In view of the limited number of cases encountered so far, particularly during the last three years, it is difficult to extrapolate any particular trends. One new TIP case was registered in Malta in 2011. 4 persons were accused, 2 Maltese nationals and another 2 from Romania. There were 3 identified victims from Romania who were recruited while they were on holiday in Greece. This case follows previous registered trends experienced in Malta, which is trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The United States TIP report published in June 2012 rated Malta in Tier 2, up from the Tier 2 (Watch list) rating of the previous reports. Whilst making recommendations in relation to further actions, the report also notes that significant progress has been registered by the Maltese authorities in the sphere of human trafficking. Since February 2012 2 cases of human trafficking were encountered. One case involved trafficking for labor and sexual exploitation. It concerned Chinese nationals working in a massage parlor and in a restaurant and resulted in the identification of 3 victims, 2 males and 1 female. All victims were being employed irregularly and under poor working conditions. The female was also being asked to provide sexual services to clients. This case was discovered during ad hoc inspection by the Police unit responsible for prostitution and trafficking. The alleged perpetrator is a Chinese National. The other case was of a Filipino young woman who was being employed by a foreign family in Malta. The victim communicated with an NGO through her lap top, the social welfare agency was alerted and the victim was helped to flee the house. The victim has a valid passport and visa therefore she can stay in the country. So far, the victim has not yet taken a decision to take the case further to the police and thus report her employers. In terms of new cases of THB 1 new case was encountered by the Police and brought before the court in February 2013 for charges of human trafficking. This is being considered as an internal trafficking case since the perpetrator and the victim are both Maltese Nationals. It is the first case of its kind in Malta.\\"European Commission.\\" Together against Trafficking in Human Beings. Prosecution The Government of Malta demonstrated minimal progress in its efforts to prosecute trafficking in persons offenses and punish trafficking offenders during the reporting period. Malta‚Äôs criminal code prohibits trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and labor exploitation and prescribes punishments of two to nine years‚Äô imprisonment. These prescribed penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not convict and punish any alleged trafficking offenders during the reporting period. Several ongoing court cases cited in the 2008 and 2009 Reports remained unresolved: the case of a police officer convicted in 2005 who remained out of jail pending an appeal; the Maltese nationals arrested for the trafficking of eight Russian and Ukrainian women; the four people prosecuted for allegedly trafficking a Romanian woman in 2004; and the 2008 case in which three men were arrested for trafficking a Swedish woman. The Police Commissioner in January 2010 directed his subordinate staff ‚Äì who are responsible for criminal prosecution as well as investigation ‚Äì to expedite and conclude current and future trafficking cases within 90 days from date of arraignment. There was one new human trafficking prosecution initiated during the reporting period. The government did not sponsor any new trafficking- specific training for police, prosecutors or judges during the reporting period, though it did provide such training for border officials. Protection The Government of Malta made no discernible progress in protecting trafficking victims during the reporting period. The absence of anti-trafficking NGOs in Malta likely contributed to challenges in victim protection as NGOs traditionally provide valuable partnership in identifying and assisting potential victims. Lack of victim identification increased the risk that victims were punished for immigration violations or other unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked. The government continued to lack formal procedures to guide first responders in identifying forced labor cases among vulnerable groups, such as foreign workers, and referring them to trafficking-specific services. The government did not show evidence of adequately implementing its formal system for referring all women in prostitution apprehended by police to government social workers. The government incorporated indicators for human trafficking as part of the asylum process for irregular migrants but did not have formal procedures on how to refer potential victims in migrant detention centers to trafficking-specific services. According to a 2009 UN Report, the government initially imposed detention on all irregular migrants upon arrival in Malta. While the government applied a fast-track procedure for vulnerable migrants, including pregnant women, families, and unaccompanied minors to be released from detention to open centers (where migrants are provided with housing and government-sponsored social services available to all Maltese citizens), it may still take up to three months. The government did not provide trafficking victims with shelter or services during the reporting period, nor were potential foreign labor trafficking victims offered residence permits, social, medical and legal assistance, and other potential safety and protection resources available under Maltese law prior to their return to their country of origin. The government has not developed or implemented standardized procedures for safe, voluntary repatriation for victims exploited in Malta. The government encourages trafficking victims to assist in the prosecution of their traffickers and attempted to implement creative ways of doing so; one victim in the past was allowed to provide testimony against her trafficker through video conferencing. Prevention The Maltese government made some progress in advancing anti-trafficking prevention activities over the last year. The government‚Äôs agency for social welfare, Appogg continued to produce detailed brochures to raise awareness about human trafficking, including information on identifying potential victims and outlets for victim assistance, and distributed them at health clinics, community centers, churches, and in entertainment areas to target potential clients of the sex trade. In late 2009, the government and an international cosmetics company forged a partnership whereby proceeds from products sold by the business would assist the government in developing an awareness campaign on child trafficking. Malta‚Äôs government Employment and Training Corporation conducted informational sessions within migrant detention centers to inform migrants about their rights and the process by which to attain work permits and proper employment, if they are granted asylum and released. The government did not formally monitor its anti-trafficking efforts and continued to lack an anti- trafficking national action plan. The government did not report any specific measures to reduce the possible participation of Maltese nationals in child sex tourism abroad.

Mauritania is a suspected source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Supposedly, some women, men, and children from traditional slave castes are subjected to slavery-related practices, rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships, which continue to exist in a limited fashion in both rural and urban settings. These individuals, held for generations by slave-holding families, may be forced to work without pay as cattle herders and household help. Mauritanian and West African boys ‚Äì referred to as talibes ‚Äì are recruited to study at Koranic schools, but are sometimes subsequently subjected to forced begging within the country by religious teachers known as marabouts. Girls have been trafficked internally and from neighboring West African countries such as Mali, Senegal, and Gambia for involuntary domestic servitude. Mauritanian girls have been married off to wealthy men from the Middle East and taken there in some cases for forced prostitution. Mauritanian women are forced into prostitution within the country, as well as in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf.\\"Mauritania\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The government of Mauritania does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The government did not show evidence of significant progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking offenders, protecting trafficking victims, and preventing new incidents of trafficking. Despite its acknowledgment of trafficking as a problem, the government is reluctant to acknowledge that de facto slavery currently exists in Mauritania, and prefers to talk about \\"the consequences of slavery\\". The government has stated it is willing to take action, but does not have the necessary resources to fund needed services, such as shelters for trafficking victims, legal assistance, and training in life-skills and income generating activities. Certain government and civil society leaders have expressed a willingness to work with foreign partners to improve the country's human rights record; however, in 2009, prosecutions of forced labor or forced prostitution offenses were nonexistent, and no government programs were put in place to assist victims of such crimes. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government did not demonstrate increased overall law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Mauritanian law prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2003 \\"Law Against Trafficking in Persons\\", which prescribes penalties of from five to 10 years' imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and exceed those prescribed for rape. Slavery is prohibited by Law 2007-048, which was enacted in September 2007. The law's effectiveness, however, is hampered by its requirement that slaves file a legal complaint before a prosecution can be pursued, as well as its barring of NGOs from filing complaints on behalf of slaves. Many slaves are illiterate and unable to complete the paperwork involved in filing a complaint. According to the Ministry of Justice, there were neither investigations nor prosecutions of trafficking offenses, nor convictions or sentences of trafficking offenders in 2009. A local human rights organization reported that judges refused to investigate two child slavery cases brought to them during the year, either on slavery or child abuse grounds. The parties reached an informal agreement outside the court, and the children remained with their slavemasters. The government provided no support for programs to assist victims systematically to file complaints on slavery. Protection The Government of Mauritania demonstrated minimal efforts to protect victims of human trafficking, including of traditional slavery. In 2009, the government's National Center for the Protection of Children in Difficulty provided shelter for 270 children, including 60 talibes identified in Nouakchott, the capital. This center returned children to their families or imams, and asked for guarantees that the children would not be sent back to the streets to beg. Government- provided access to legal and medical services was very limited, and the government did not offer shelter or long-term housing benefits to victims aside from the aforementioned center for talibes. The government did not have a referral process in place to transfer victims who were detained, arrested, or placed in protective custody by law enforcement authorities to institutions that provided short- or long-term care. The government's law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel did not have a formal system of proactively identifying victims of trafficking among high-risk persons with whom they came in contact. Illegal migrants were detained and placed in the Migrant Detention Center at Nouadhibou until their expulsion from the country, without the government making any effort to identify trafficking victims among them. Women suspected of prostitution were often jailed. The government made no attempts to screen these women for victimization. The government did not encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases, and there were no precedents of victims filing civil suits or seeking legal action against trafficking offenders. In slavery cases, civil society representatives claimed that judges attempted to broker informal agreements between the masters and disgruntled slaves. Courts often dropped cases and avoided conducting investigations. Prevention The Government of Mauritania made inadequate efforts to raise awareness of trafficking during the last year. In 2009, the government, in conjunction with civil society, conducted a public awareness campaign in local newspapers about the plight of domestic workers, and also about the 2007 anti-slavery law, as part of the government's \\"Program to Eradicate the Consequences of Slavery\\". The government did not monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. There was no mechanism for coordination and communication between various agencies on trafficking-related matters. In 2009 the government worked in association with an international organization to draft a National Action Plan to Fight Trafficking in Persons, to be released in 2010. The government made no efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor.

Secondary school-age girls and, to a lesser extent, younger girls from all areas of the country, including from Rodrigues Island, are induced into prostitution, often by their peers, family members, or businessmen offering other forms of employment. Taxi drivers are known to provide transportation and introductions for both the girls and the clients. Girls and boys whose mothers engage in prostitution are reportedly forced into prostitution at a young age. Some drug-addicted women are forced into prostitution by their boyfriends, who serve as their pimps. In Great Britain, two Malagasy nationals were convicted in 2009 of holding a small number of Mauritian nationals, as well as citizens of other countries, in conditions of forced labor; this appears to be an isolated case of transnational human trafficking involving Mauritian citizens. Students from all over the world are forced into prostitution within the country. The Government of Mauritius fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Mauritius sustained its strong efforts to identify, investigate, and prosecute incidences of trafficking during the reporting period. The Mauritius Police Force increased its offerings of anti- trafficking training programs for police officers, and continued its awareness campaign in schools and villages. The government's efforts to coordinate among all relevant ministries, however, remained lacking, leading to inconsistent provision of protective and investigative services to trafficking victims.\\"Mauritius\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution In 2011, the government prosecuted 14 cases of forced labour involving domestic workers and six cases of sex trafficking under the anti- trafficking law. The government has taken swift efforts to clamp down on prostitution and child sex tourism. The Mauritian government demonstrated increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, vigorously investigating and prosecuting cases of human trafficking throughout the year. The ‚ÄúCombating of Trafficking in Persons Act of 2009‚Äù prohibits all forms of trafficking for adults and children and prescribes penalties of up to 15 years' imprisonment for convicted offenders. In addition, the Child Protection Act of 2005 prohibits all forms of child trafficking and prescribes punishment of up to 15 years' imprisonment for convicted offenders; the Judicial Provisions Act of 2008 increased the maximum prescribed punishment for child trafficking offenses to 30 years' imprisonment. All of the aforementioned penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes. From arrest to sentencing of offenders, cases of child trafficking typically took 18 to 24 months to resolve. In October 2009, the government used the Children Protection Act to convict and sentence a woman to ten years' imprisonment for subjecting two underage Mauritian girls to prostitution in 2007. Also during the year, the Mauritius Police Force's Minors Brigade, which carries out all investigations involving trafficked children, completed the investigation into a 2007 case of a grandmother who allegedly forced her granddaughter into prostitution and referred it to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for action. In 2009, the DPP referred for trial the January 2008 case of a man and woman charged with inducing their 12-year-old niece into prostitution; the case was scheduled to be heard in April 2010. The Minors Brigade utilized a database for tracking criminal trafficking cases, as well as awareness campaigns carried out in the community. In 2009 and early 2010, the Officer in Charge of the brigade conducted five training sessions on best practices for combating human trafficking for all 32 of the Minors Brigade's officers. The Police training school conducted anti-trafficking sessions during a two-week program for 182 senior police officers. Seventy government officials also received training on the commercial sexual exploitation of children from a local NGO. Protection The government sustained its protection of child trafficking victims during the reporting period, providing funding to NGO's running victim shelters on a reimbursable basis ‚Äì $6 per day for the protection of each child, including victims of trafficking. CDU officials regularly referred abused and exploited children to these organizations for shelter and other assistance. The Minor's Brigade systematically refers all cases of identified children in prostitution to the CDU for victim assistance; in 2009, the brigade referred two such children for protective services. The CDU did not, however, refer all cases of child prostitution identified by its officers to the Minors Brigade for possible investigation. The government-funded, NGO-run drop-in center for sexually abused children, which provided counseling to six girls engaged in prostitution in 2009, advertised its services through bumper stickers, a toll-free number, and community outreach; its social worker continued to promote the services in schools and local communities. Nonetheless, due to the drop-in center's lack of shelter facilities and the often crowded conditions at NGO shelters, comprehensive protective services were not always readily available to all victims identified within the country. Though the MOWR acquired land and obtained funding to construct a residential center for victims of child commercial sexual exploitation in late 2008, construction of the facility has not yet begun. The ministry operated a 24-hour hotline for reporting cases of sexual abuse that received two reported cases of child prostitution in 2009. Mauritius has a formal protocol on the provision of assistance to all victims of sexual abuse; children victimized by commercial sexual exploitation are accompanied to the hospital by a child welfare officer, and police work in conjunction with this officer to obtain a statement. Medical treatment and psychological support were readily available at public clinics and NGO centers in Mauritius. The Child Protection (Amendment) Act of 2008 established a child mentoring scheme to provide support and rehabilitation to children in distress, including children engaged in prostitution; the government did not utilize this program to assist children engaged in or at risk of prostitution during the reporting period. The government encourages victims' assistance in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes, and ensures that victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The government made notable efforts to prevent the sex trafficking of children and reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the year. The Police Family Protection Unit and the Minor's Brigade, in conjunction with the CDU, continued its widespread awareness campaign on child abuse and child rights at schools and community centers that included a session on the dangers and consequences of engaging in prostitution; this campaign reached over 16,372 persons in 2009, including 1,574 parents from tourist regions where children have greater risk of trafficking. Law enforcement and child welfare officials conducted surveillance at bus stops, night clubs, gaming houses, and other places frequented by children to identify and interact with students who were at a high risk of sex trafficking. The Ministry of Tourism, Leisure, and External Communications sustained its distribution of pamphlets to hotels and tour operators regarding the responsibility of the tourism sector to combat child sex trafficking. Communication and coordination among the relevant ministries, however, continued to be lacking. There were reports in 2009 that Mauritian nationals may be participating in child sex tourism in Nosy Be, Madagascar; the government took no specific action to address this problem during the year. Inspections conducted by the Ministry of Labor's 30 labor officers and nine trainee officers in 2009 yielded no cases of forced labor or exploitative child labor.

She won many doubles titles on the pro tour with several different partners including Ann Kiyomura and Kerry Reid with whom she won the Australian Open doubles title in 1977. She was a women's doubles and mixed doubles standout in World Team Tennis and was part of the #1 women's doubles team in the League with Billie Jean King in 1975 and the #1 mixed doubles team with Ross Case in 1978. Anne retired from the pro tour in 1980, and since then she has also won one world and fourteen age group National Singles Championships as of 2016. She is a retired real estate entrepreneur, a philanthropist, and author of How to Be Richer Than Your Parents, a book about finances for high schoolers and young adults. Women's rights pioneer Guerrant grew up in Iowa City, Iowa, in a big family with seven children. As a little girl she was always playing sports. Even though she was one of the best local baseball players, when she was 10 she was not allowed to play Little League baseball because she was a girl. Looking for an alternative sport open to girls, one of her brothers showed her how to play tennis. She was discovered by Don Klotz, the Tennis Coach at the University of Iowa, when she won her first tournament. Klotz taught her for free until she was 18 and went off to college. While she was at Iowa City High School there were no sports for girls at all. When she was a high school junior Guerrant went to her local school board and made a case for a girls' tennis team. She got all five votes. The school got a girls' tennis team, and Guerrant won the state high school tournament twice. She received an academic scholarship to Rollins College in Florida where she played varsity tennis. The women's pro tennis tour was just getting started when she graduated with a degree in Behavioral Science, and she decided to try the pro tour until her money ran out. The money never ran out. The #1 Women's Doubles Team in World Team Tennis in 1975 Guerrant was one of the founders of the Women‚Äôs Tennis Association along with Billie Jean King and other women‚Äôs rights pioneers. She was the Chairman of the Ranking Committee and helped introduce the first computer-generated ranking system to the women‚Äôs pro tour. Women‚Äôs tennis was a highly visible manifestation of the progress of the Women‚Äôs Lib movement of the 1970s. The crowds grew, prize money kept increasing, and women gained more and more respect as athletes and as people. Guerrant lives in Gilbert, Arizona with her husband, Terry Guerrant, whom she married in 1975. They have one son, Daniel Guerrant. The Guerrants were real estate investment entrepreneurs from 1976 until they retired in 2005. Charitable activities When Guerrant was playing on the pro tour and traveling the world she saw poverty, especially the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She resolved to help those impoverished people but did not know an effective way until she took a trip in 2005 to India with her husband, Terry. They visited a micro-lending program in a small village of mud huts and saw firsthand what small loans of $40‚Äì350 could do to transform a village. After seeing the extreme poverty and the impressive entrepreneurial results that women had achieved taking out and re-paying small loans, the couple decided micro-lending was the best way to make a lasting difference. They created the Guerrant Foundation, Inc. in late 2005. The Guerrant Foundation helps women and families improve their lives through small loans to start their own businesses. The interest on these small loans covers administrative expenses, and the repaid principal is loaned out again and again in a never ending cycle of prosperity. Guerrant Foundation The Guerrant Foundation has improved the lives of thousands of the world's most impoverished people.

Mexico is a large source, transit, and destination country for victims of human trafficking.{{Cite journallast=Acharyafirst=Arun Kumardate=June 2016title=Trafficking of Women and Children in Mexico: An Assessment of Anti-trafficking Lawsjournal=RCISvolume=53pages=5‚Äì21} Government and NGO statistics indicate that the magnitude of forced labor surpasses that of forced prostitution in Mexico. Groups considered most vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico include women, children, indigenous persons, and undocumented migrants. Mexican women, girls, and boys are subjected to sexual servitude within the United States and Mexico, lured by false job offers from poor rural regions to urban, border, and tourist areas. Mexican trafficking victims were also subjected to conditions of forced labor in domestic servitude, street begging, and construction in both the United States and Mexico.\\"Mexico\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010 . U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017.  Types  Human trafficking in Mexico takes many forms, including sex trafficking and labor trafficking. Often, migrants being willingly smuggled are entrapped in one or more of these types of trafficking. = Sex trafficking = While sex work is largely Illegal in Mexico, most cities do have Zonas de Tolerancia, areas where prostitution is allowed. This has made Mexico a destination for sex tourism and one of the world's largest hubs for sex trafficking; It is the largest destination for sex tourism from the United States. Sex work's profitability in Mexico has driven the forced exploitation of many girls as sex workers. Mexico is on the Tier 2 Watch List of the U.S. State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, a designation given to countries that do not meet the minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (TVPRA), but which are still making efforts to comply with these guidelines, in large part because of its booming child sex trafficking industry; an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 Mexican and Central American children are thought to be victims of sex trafficking in the country Mexico is rated as the second worst country in terms of child prostitution globally as of 2010.Monroy, P. (2010). Mexico: pasividad ante explotaci√≥n sexual infantil. Contralinea, Septiembre, Mexico DF, http://contralinea.info/archivo-revista/index.php/2010/ 09/05/mexico-pasividad-ante-explotacion-sexual-infantil/ Governmental ineffectiveness and rampant corruption have corroded trust in the Mexican government, which is evident in the declining rate of crime reporting in border regions of Mexico. = Labor trafficking = Mexico is also host to large numbers of persons trafficked for labor purposes, though reliable statistics on their numbers do not exist. Victims are often migrants who engage smugglers voluntarily and are then forced into labor arrangements against their will. Additionally, many of these arrangements take place within the United States rather than within Mexico itself and are thus not necessarily included in Mexican trafficking statistics. Despite this, substantial amounts of trafficked labor, particularly in the form of domestic servitude, are known to be employed within Mexico itself.  Prevalence  Mexico is one of the global centers of the child prostitution trade and a source and transit country for large numbers of migrants moving northward from Central America. There are an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 Mexican and Central American children who are trafficked for sex in Mexico. However, data on the number of victims of labor trafficking are not available. Additionally, the number of people trafficking into the United States from Mexico is known to vary widely, as do estimates of how many trafficking victims make such crossings. The vast majority of foreign victims in forced labor and sexual servitude in Mexico are from Central America, particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador; many transit Mexico en route to the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Western Europe. However, trafficking victims from South America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa are also found in Mexico, and some transit the country en route to the United States. Unaccompanied Central American minors, traveling through Mexico to meet family members in the United States, fall victim to human traffickers, particularly near the Guatemalan border. Mexican men and boys from Southern Mexico are found in conditions of forced labor in Northern Mexico, and Central Americans, especially Guatemalans, are subjected to forced labor in southern Mexico, particularly in agriculture. Child sex tourism continues to grow in Mexico, especially in tourist areas such as Acapulco and Canc√∫n, and northern border cities like Tijuana and Ciudad Ju√°rez. Between 2000 and 2002, approximately 135,000 children in Mexico were kidnapped, presumably for exploitation in prostitution, pornography, or illegal adoption trafficking. It is estimated that there are around 16,000 children engaged in prostitution in Mexico as of 2004. Structural causes = Poverty = Mexican States by Poverty Rate Mexico is characterized by persistent and extreme income inequality and high rates of poverty. These inequalities, and poverty in particular, can increase trafficking in several ways. Poverty often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. For example, in the case of Mexico parents are especially likely to leave their families to go work in the United States and may become victims of traffickers. Furthermore, many victims of trafficking, especially in the case of sex trafficking, are not fluent in the language of their destination country and are limited in their ability to escape their situation. In addition, victims often accept their positions because they feel that this is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state. In this manner, poverty can both drive trafficking and prevent its victims from escaping it once they have been trafficked. = Globalization = The rate of human trafficking has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border trade and the demand for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations. = Sexual assault = During the Central American civil wars throughout the 1980s, widespread sexual assaults of indigenous women were carried out, contributing greatly to the creation of the Mexican sex trafficking industry. Both policy and army personnel raped and assaulted several thousand poor, generally rural women during the El Salvadorean and Nicaraguan civil wars. Many of these women were shamed by their communities and families and chose to migrate to Mexico, leading to a boom in sex trafficking. As of 2014, this pattern of marginalization through sexual assault was still widespread. The effect of conflict and ensuing assault on the development of the sex trade is domestic to Mexico as well as foreign. Internal conflict between organized crime and police forces and the military have historically lead to unusually high levels of instability in some areas of Mexico, most notably in the case of the Chiapas Conflict. Similarly to the Central American civil wars, the sexual violence that accompanied this conflict drove many shunned women to turn to sex work and helped jump start the sex trade in those regions of Mexico. Anti-trafficking laws and policies Mexico ratified the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (or Palermo Convention) on April 11, 2003. The Convention includes a \\"Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and Air\\" and a \\"Protocol to Suppress, Prevent, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children\\". The Congress of Mexico passed a law on human trafficking in 2007 after which the Federal District and all of the states passed anti-trafficking measures themselves. In an attempt to harmonize the varied penal codes on the subject of human trafficking, the government passed a new anti-trafficking law in 2012 that criminalized all participants in the act of trafficking (including consumers) and unified local laws. The law was further reformed in 2014. In an effort to address the demand for forced labor, the Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare developed a series of workshops and trainings in 2010 to prevent child labor and trafficking for forced labor. It included media materials that explain how labor recruiting agents can deceive individuals in order to recruit them for forced labor. However, while Mexican officials recognize human trafficking as a serious problem, NGOs and government representatives report that some local officials tolerate and are sometimes complicit in trafficking, impeding implementation of anti- trafficking statutes. Mexico has publicly endorsed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime‚Äôs Blue Heart Campaign against Human Trafficking, becoming the first country in Latin America to do so. Trafficking across the border with the United States The U.S.‚ÄìMexico border with the area up to 100 miles from the border demarcated. A third of the people annually trafficked into the United States are from Latin America, and the vast majority of these people enter the US through the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. This extremely porous border has historically been the site of one of the most protracted labor migrations in the world, and is North America's largest transit site for young children exploited in labor and sex trafficking as of 2011. Texas is a particularly important transit site for domestic trafficking; around twenty percent of domestic trafficking victims pass through the state at some point on their journeys. \\"Coyote\\" is the colloquial term used to refer to migrant smugglers along the Mexico- United States border. In the past, the coyote- migrant relationship ended once the smuggler delivered the migrant to the U.S. However, it has become increasingly commonplace for coyotes to coerce migrants into exploitative labor arrangements upon reaching their destination in the U.S (frequently a different one from that which they paid to be smuggled to). These labor agreements frequently involve forced agricultural labor and/or sex work, conditions that migrants would never have consented to had they been previously aware of them. Coyotes use unpaid debt as a threat in order to force migrants into such arrangements. The rising costs of smuggling, a result of increased border security and enforcement, has made it far more common for migrants to become heavily indebted to smugglers. Additionally, the expansion of the coyote's role to include transporting migrants to a final destination within the U.S., rather than simply transporting them across the border, incurs additional expenses that the migrant must pay, and so increases the likelihood of their being exploited and trafficked by the coyotes as forced laborers or sex workers. Smugglers sometimes pretend to offer reduced fees to women and child migrants and then sexually assault or rape them as a form of substitute \\"payment\\". Human traffickers masquerading as coyotes often use false promises of guaranteed jobs to lure migrants, and will sometimes kidnap women and children along the journey, either for ransom from their families, or to be sold in the US into servitude or prostitution. Many unaccompanied children also make the crossing from Mexico to the U.S. Unaccompanied minors are sometimes sold into prostitution by the trafficker, and their families are falsely led to believe that they died during transit. Within the United States, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 serves as a legal framework within which many perpetrators of trafficking are tried, but victims of trafficking are generally punished on equal footing with perpetrators if intercepted during the process of entering the country.

He worked for the BBC until 2015. In July 2016 he became Investigations Editor at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Jones has investigated many subjects including the alleged fixing of the US Presidential Election in 2000, toxic waste dumping in Africa, how Britain helped Israel‚Äôs nuclear weapons programme, market-rigging by multinationals, bogus bomb detectors, tsunami aid, terror and security, political scandals and financial scams. He also worked with journalist Liz MacKean in late 2011 on a Newsnight investigation into the activities of suspected paedophile Jimmy Savile. Its rejection by their superior, (former) Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, ultimately led to a major scandal. Early career Jones was the first full-time Editor of the Cardiff student paper Gair Rhydd. He once broke in the principal's office to copy and expose files about an Iraqi henchman. As a sanction, he lost his Honorary Lifetime Membership that all students automatically get.A brief history of Gair Rhydd: 1972-2009, Gair Rhydd on Issuu.com, 8 June 2009 He freelanced at New Scientist where he wrote about everything from food poisoning to how to phase out the CFCs which at the time were damaging the ozone layer. Hospital caterers 'could cause listeriosis epidemic' New Scientist 21 July 1988 In search of the safe CFCs New Scientist 26 May 1988 He has also written freelance for The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent. Career Jones and Greg Palast revealed how many black voters in Florida had been barred from voting in the 2000 election by a purge of the Florida Central Voter File. Jones and Palast have been working together since 1998 and have made more than a dozen investigative films on subjects such as oil and the war in Iraq, the Bin Laden family, the Bush family, the coup against Chavez, and vulture funds. In 2005-6, Jones made three films with Michael Crick on nuclear weapons and Israel which revealed for the first time how Britain had helped Israel's nuclear weapons programme. Papers obtained through Freedom of Information showed how the UK had secretly exported the heavy water to Israel to start up the Dimona nuclear reactor and had supplied Israel with samples of uranium 235, plutonium and lithium 6. Jones wrote a print version of the revelations which New Statesman ran as their cover story. In September 2016, Jones and Israeli nuclear historian Avner Cohen wrote a piece for Haaretz revealing that there had been an investigation into 1960s British nuclear weapons chief Nyman Levin. QED 2016 about the fake bomb detector ADE 651 that he helped expose. On 22 January 2010 the British government announced that it would ban the export of \\"magic wand\\" type bomb detectors to Iraq and Afghanistan because of the danger to British and allied troops. The ban on the ADE651, GT200, Alpha 6 and similar products was the result of an investigation by Jones and the BBC's then Baghdad correspondent Caroline Hawley broadcast that day which showed that the detectors did not and could not work. British businessman Jim McCormick sold $85 million of the bogus detectors to Iraq before the ban. The Inspector General of the Iraqi Interior Ministry told the BBC that hundreds of civilians in Baghdad had died as a result of because suicide bombers were able to smuggle explosives past checkpoints equipped with the bogus devices.http://www.ny.com/2009/11/04/world/middleeast/04sensors.html On 23 April 2013, McCormick, was convicted of three counts of fraud involving the ADE651 at the Old Bailey in London,and was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The owner of the company which made the GT200, Gary Bolton, who sold thousands of the devices in Mexico Thailand and other countries was also convicted on 26 July 2013 on two charges of fraud and subsequently jailed for seven years. Since 2007, Jones and Greg Palast have been investigating Vulture fund operations, which attempt to divert into their own pockets the money given by Western governments to pay off the debts of poor countries. These films formed the centerpiece of a campaign backed by Oxfam and the Jubilee Debt Campaign to outlaw this practice through a Debt Relief Bill. The first film in 2007 exposed an American vulture who liked to call himself ¬´Goldfinger¬ª who was suing Zambia. It was rebroadcast in the USA and seen by two Congressmen who immediately went to the White House and asked President Bush face-to-face to curb the vulture funds. Beginning in 2009, Jones made a series of films over three years exposing how toxic waste from the oil trader Trafigura came to be illegally dumped in Abidjan in Africa rather than safely disposed of in the Netherlands. According to the government of Ivory Coast 16 people died and thousands were poisoned by the waste. The films were made in the face of pressure from Trafigura's lawyers Carter-Ruck who were attempting to close down press coverage of Trafigura's role in the scandal. Ultimately Carter-Ruck even attempted to use a super-injunction to stop The Guardian reporting mentions of Trafigura in Parliament. In response to the pressure Jones set up a network of international journalists and investigators to share information on the dumping, informally known as \\"Team Trafigura\\". In April 2010 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists gave the Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting to the members of that team for exposing \\"how a powerful offshore oil trader tried to cover up the poisoning of 30,000 West Africans\\". On 15 October 2010, the multi-national Reckitt Benckiser was fined ¬£10 million for rigging the market for Gaviscon following an investigation by Jones and Martin Shankleman. Immediately after Jimmy Savile's death in October 2011, Jones and his colleague Liz MacKean began an investigation for Newsnight into Savile's apparent history of abuse and that he had been a paedophile. They interviewed one victim on camera and others agreed to have their stories told anonymously. Jones and MacKean discovered that Surrey police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile. The programme was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011 but the film was never shown and the BBC broadcast tributes to Savile at Christmas 2011. The decision to pull the Newsnight investigation eventually led to a major crisis in public trust of the BBC. The later Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean had found cogent evidence that Savile was an abuser and that the programme could have exposed Savile in 2011 but a flawed decision was made not to broadcast There was no public mention of the Newsnight investigation into Savile at the time but In early 2012, several newspapers reported that BBC had investigated allegations of sexual abuse immediately after Savile's death, but the report was not broadcast. An article by Miles Goslett in The Oldie alleged there had been a cover-up by the BBC. In 2014, Jones was the joint producer with Owen Phillips of the Panorama about the ex-News of the World undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood called ‚ÄúFake Sheikh: Exposed‚Äù which starting from the case of Tulisa Contostavlos alleged that many of Mazher Mahmood's investigations had been dishonest. The broadcast was twice delayed and was finally transmitted on 12 November 2014. Following the programme the Crown Prosecution Service announced that they would reinvestigate 25 cases where people were convicted on Mahmood‚Äôs evidence. Mazher Mahmood was convicted in October 2016 of conspiring to pervert the course of justice in the Tulisa Contostavlos case and sentenced to 15 months in prison. In July 2016, Jones became Investigations Editor at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

They are non-electrical hardware frequently used as visual sight- indicators for surface demarcation and level measurement. They may also be incorporated into switch mechanisms or translucent fluid-tubes as a component in monitoring or controlling liquid level. Liquid level floats, or float switches, use the principle of material buoyancy (differential densities) to follow fluid levels. Solid floats are often made of plastics with a density less than water or other application liquid, and so they float. Hollow floats filled with air are much less dense than water or other liquids, and are appropriate for some applications. Stainless Steel Magnetic floats are tubed magnetic floats, used for reed switch activation; they have a hollow tubed connection running through them. These magnetic floats have become standard equipment where strength, corrosion resistance and buoyancy are necessary. They are manufactured by welding two drawn half shells together. The welding process is critical for the strength and durability of the float. The weld is a full penetration weld providing a smoothly finished seam, hardly distinguishable from the rest of the float surface. Liquid level floats can also be constructed with thermoplastic corrosion-resistant materials. These materials include PVC, Polypropylene and PVDF. An example of an application that would require such materials would be if a manufacturer of metal plating and metal finishing lines required continuous level measurement of their chromic acid tanks. Stainless Steel would rapidly corrode in chromic acid, which is why one would have the option to go with a PVDF float, which is a material with great chemical resistance to chromic acid. Thermoplastic level floats are a great alternative to some other forms of level sensors such as ultrasonic or radar when dealing with corrosive chemical applications. This is because some chemicals create vapor blankets or corrosive fumes inside of tanks. Liquid level floats are unaffected by any foam, vapor, turbulence or condensate inside of the tanks that would normally cause issues with an ultrasonic or radar level sensor.

Its signal can also be seen in other parts of east county San Diego, albeit with some interference. When the station is on the air with its VHF signal on channel 7, it blocks Los Angeles' ABC-owned KABC-TV, which has a digital signal on channel 7 which can be received when KZTC is off the air for whatever reason. The station went from airing infomercials to rebroadcasting MundoFox (now defunct) from XHDTV-TDT's second digital subchannel (49.2), a MyNetworkTV affiliate, operated by Entravision Communications. The station's schedule consists of paid programming seven-days a week, twenty-four hours a day. The station's owner, Civic Light Television, claims to have operated low power television operations in the San Diego area since 1990, when the FCC began to authorize television stations of that type. While KZTC's license goes back to 1990 when it operated on UHF channel 63 as \\"Bay 63\\" (with the call sign K63EN), it moved to analog VHF channel 7 in July 2010 in order to vacate the defunct channel 52-69 channel space in the Federal Communications Commission UHF revised bandplan. \\"Bay 63\\" originally operated from a small suite in a medical arts building at 2850 6th Avenue in the Hillcrest district of downtown San Diego, adjacent to Balboa Park. The station showed San Diego City Council proceedings and other public domain shows. It was an affiliate of the \\"Shop At Home\\" network during the time it operated from downtown San Diego. Because the station operated from the top floor of the building, it was also known for broadcasting nightly the sun setting off San Diego Bay.

A panoramic radiograph is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two- dimensional view of a half-circle from ear to ear. Panoramic radiography is a form of focal plane tomography; thus, images of multiple planes are taken to make up the composite panoramic image, where the maxilla and mandible are in the focal trough and the structures that are superficial and deep to the trough are blurred. Other nonproprietary names for a panoramic radiograph are dental panoramic radiograph and pantomogram; Abbreviations include PAN, DPR, OPT, and OPG (the latter, based on genericizing a trade name, are often avoided in medical editing). Types Dental panoramic radiography equipment consists of a horizontal rotating arm which holds an X-ray source and a moving film mechanism (carrying a film) arranged at opposed extremities. The patient's skull sits between the X-ray generator and the film. The X-ray source is rectangular collimated beam. Also the height of that beam covers the mandibles and the maxilla regions. The arm moves and its movement may be described as a rotation around an instant center which shifts on a dedicated trajectory. The manufacturers propose different solutions for moving the arm, trying to maintain constant distance between the teeth to the film and generator. Also those moving solutions try to project the teeth arch as orthogonally as possible. It is impossible to select an ideal movement as the anatomy varies very much from person to person. Finally a compromise is selected by each manufacturer and results in magnification factors which vary strongly along the film (15%-30%). The patient positioning is very critical in regard to both sharpness and distortions. =Films= There are two kinds of film moving mechanisms, one using a sliding flat cassette which holds the film, and another using a rotating cylinder around which the film is wound. There are two standard sizes for dental panoramic films: 30 cm √ó 12 cm (12‚Ä≥ √ó 5‚Ä≥) and 30 cm x 15 cm (12‚Ä≥ √ó 6‚Ä≥). The smaller size film receives 8% less X-ray dosage on it compared to the bigger size. =Digital= Dental X-rays' radiology is moving from film technology (involving a chemical developing process) to digital X-ray technology, which is based on electronic sensors and computers. One of the principal advantages compared to film based systems is the much greater exposure latitude. This means many fewer repeated scans, which reduces costs and also reduces patient exposure to radiation. Lost X-rays can also be reprinted if the digital file is saved. Other significant advantages include instantly viewable images, the ability to enhance images, the ability to email images to practitioners and clients (without needing to digitize them first), easy and reliable document handling, reduced X-ray exposure, that no darkroom is required, and that no chemicals are used. One particular type of digital system uses a photostimulable phosphor plate (aka PSP - Phosphor Plate) in place of the film. After X-ray exposure the plate (sheet) is placed in a special scanner where the latent formed image is retrieved point by point and digitized, using a laser light scanning. The digitized images are stored and displayed on the computer screen. This method is in between old film based technology and the current direct digital imaging technology. It is similar to the film process because it involves the same image support handling and differs because the chemical development process is replaced by the scanning process. This is not much faster than film processing and the resolution and sensitivity performances are contested. However it has the clear advantage of being able to fit with any existing equipment without any modification because it replaces just the existing film. Also sometimes the term \\"digital X-rays\\" is used to designate the scanned film documents which further are handled by computers. The other types of digital imaging technologies use electronic sensors. A majority of them first convert the X-rays in light (using a GdO2S or CsI layer) which is further captured using a CCD or a CMOS image sensor. Few of them use a hybrid analog-to-digital arrangement which first converts the X-ray into electricity (using a CdTe layer) and then this electricity is rendered as an image by a reading section based on CMOS technology. In current state-of-the-art digital systems, the image quality is vastly superior to conventional film-based systems. The latest advancements have also seen the addition on Cone Beam 3D Technology to standard digital panoramic devices. Indications Panoramic radiograph showing horizontally impacted lower wisdom teeth. Minimally-displaced fracture in right mandibular. Arrow marks fracture, root canal on central incisor, teeth to the left of fracture do not touch Panoramic radiograph showing Stafne defect (arrowed). Dental panoramic radiograph showing dentigerous cyst (arrowed). Orthopantomograms (OPTs) are used by health care professionals to provide information on: * Impacted wisdom teeth diagnosis and treatment planning - the most common use is to determine the status of wisdom teeth and trauma to the jaws. * Periodontal bone loss and periapical involvement. * Finding the source of dental pain, and when carrying out tooth-by-tooth diagnosis. * Assessment for the placement of dental implants * Orthodontic assessment. pre and post operative * Diagnosis of developmental anomalies such as cherubism, cleido cranial dysplasia * Carcinoma in relation to the jaws * Temporomandibular joint dysfunctions and ankylosis. * Diagnosis of osteosarcoma, ameloblastoma, renal osteodystrophy affecting jaws and hypophosphatemia. * Diagnosis, and pre- and post-surgical assessment of oral and maxillofacial trauma, e.g. dentoalveolar fractures and mandibular fractures. * Salivary stones (Sialolithiasis). * Other diagnostic and treatment applications.Dental Radiographic Examinations: Recommendations For Patient Selection And Limiting Radiation Exposure. Am Dent Assoc, U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services, FDA. Revised: 2012 Mechanism Normally, the person bites on a plastic spatula so that all the teeth, especially the crowns, can be viewed individually. The whole orthopantomogram process takes about one minute. The patient's actual radiation exposure time varies between 5.5 and 22 seconds for the machine‚Äôs excursion around the skull. The collimation of the machine means that, while rotating, the X-rays project only a limited portion of the anatomy onto the film at any given instant but, as the rotation progresses around the skull, a composite picture of the maxillo- facial block is created. While the arm rotates, the film moves in a such way that the projected partial skull image (limited by the beam section) scrolls over it and exposes it entirely. Not all of the overlapping individual images projected on the film have the same magnification because the beam is divergent and the images have differing focus points. Also not all the element images move with the same velocity on the target film as some of them are more distant from and others closer to the instant rotation center. The velocity of the film is controlled in such fashion to fit exactly the velocity of projection of the anatomical elements of the dental arch side which is closest to the film. Therefore, they are recorded sharply while the elements in different places are recorded blurred as they scroll at different velocity. The dental panoramic image suffers from important distortions because a vertical zoom and a horizontal zoom both vary differently along the image. The vertical and horizontal zooms are determined by the relative position of the recorded element versus film and generator. Features closer to the generator receive more vertical zoom. The horizontal zoom is also dependent on the relative position of the element to the focal path. Features inside the focal path arch receive more horizontal zoom and are blurred; features outside receive less horizontal zoom and are blurred. The result is an image showing sharply the section along the mandible arch, and blurred elsewhere. For example, the more radio-opaque anatomical region, the cervical vertebrae (neck), shows as a wide and blurred vertical pillar overlapping the front teeth. The path where the anatomical elements are recorded sharply is called \\"focal path\\". =Principal advantage of panoramic images= * Broad coverage of facial bone and teeth * Low patient radiation dose * Convenience of examination for the patient (films need not be placed inside the mouth) * Ability to be used in patients who cannot open the mouth or when the opening is restricted e.g.: due to trismus * Short time required for making the image * Patient's ready understandability of panoramic films, making them a useful visual aid in patient education and case presentation. * Easy to store compared to the large set of intra oral x-rays which are typically used.Stuart C. White, Micheal J Pharoh, Oral Radiology and Interpretation Mosby 2005 Preparation Persons who are to undergo panoramic radiography usually are required to remove any earrings, jewellery, hair pins, glasses, dentures or orthodontic appliances. If these articles are not removed, they may create artifacts on the image (especially if they contain metal) and reduce its usefulness. There is also a need for the person to stay absolutely still during the 18 or so second cycle it takes for the machine to expose the film. For this reason, radiographers often explain to the person beforehand how the machine will move. Adverse effects Like any medical imaging utilizing ionizing radiation, there will be a minute degree of direct ionizing damage and indirect damage from free radicals created during the ionization of water molecules within cells. A rough estimate of the risk of fatal cancer from a panoramic radiograph is about 1 in 20,000,000. The age of the person being imaged also alters the risk, with younger people having a slightly higher risk. E.g. the 1 in 10,000,000 risk would be doubled for someone in the 1-10 age group. History =Historical milestones for digital panoramic systems= 1985‚Äì1991 ‚Äì The first attempt to build a dental digital panoramic was of McDavid et al. at UTHSCSA.http://www.google.com/patents/US5018177 Their idea was based on a linear pixel array(single pixel column) sensor which was not appropriate for such an application because: a) there is no tomographic effect; b) huge difficulties to collimate the X-rays beam and to control the X-ray dose delivered to the patient; c) poor generator efficiency. DXIS - real time display 1995 ‚Äì DXIS, the first dental digital panoramic X-rays system available on the market, created by Catalin Stoichita at Signet (France). DXIS targeted to retrofit all the panoramic models. 1997 ‚Äì SIDEXIS, of Siemens (currently Sirona Dental Systems, Germany) offered a digital option for Ortophos Plus panoramic unit, DigiPan of Trophy Radiology (France) offered a digital option for the OP100 panoramic made by Instrumentarium (Finland). 1998‚Äì2004 ‚Äì many panoramic manufacturers offered their own digital systems. Research Arrows point to two vertical white lines which is how calcifications in the first part (proximal component) of the internal carotid artery appear on panoramic radiographs. A line drawing depicting a panoramic radiograph with an ovoid atheroma in the bifurcation region of the common carotid artery (CCA) as it bifurcates (divides) in the neck into the internal carotid artery (ICA) which supplies blood to the brain and the external carotid artery (ECA) which supplies blood to the face and mouth. Panoramic radiographs have the capability to demonstrate a portion of the neck and display atheromas (calcifications in the carotid artery) which are an indication of both local and generalized (systemic) atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries leading to myocardial infarction (heart attack), and atherosclerosis of the carotid artery leading to stroke are the number one and number three most common causes of death in the United States.American Heart Association‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics‚Äö√Ñ√Æ2010 Update There is interest to look at panoramic radiographs as a screening tool, however further data is needed with regards if it is able to make a meaningful difference in outcomes. = Epidemiology: general public and high risk groups = Additional research projects have further determined the prevalence rate of these atheromas in the general population (3‚Äì5%) and among high-risk groups (over 25% in: recent stroke victims, individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, postmenopausal women, type 2 diabetics, individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy, and among individuals who have received radiotherapy directed at the neck,). These findings have been corroborated by other several other researchers. = Dental infection and atherosclerosis = Atherosclerosis is attributed to risk factors that include cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (high blood pressure). These factors, however, do not fully account for the risk of disease. Atherosclerosis has been conceptualized as a chronic inflammatory response to endothelial cell injury and dysfunction possibly arising from chronic dental infection. In 2010, using the previously validated Mattila panoramic radiographic index to quantify the totality of dental infection (i.e., periapical and furcal lesions, pericoronitis sites, carious tooth roots, teeth with pulpal caries, and vertical bony defects), Friedlander‚Äôs group determined that individuals with carotid artery atheromas on their panoramic radiographs had significantly greater amounts of dental infection/inflammation than atherogenic risk-matched controls devoid of radiographic atheromas. While the Mattila index had been previously used to relate the extent of dental infection to coronary artery disease, this research is the first to link the full range of dental disease that it measures to panoramic radiographs evidencing calcified carotid artery atherosclerosis.

It broadcasts news 24 hours a day, publishing 3,000 articles on average per day. It serves content to almost 2,000 clients, including the main Spanish media: radios; newspapers; televisions and national, autonomic and local digital media. Also, among its clients there are the High Statal Institutions, all Public Ministries, Autonomous Governments, Public Halls, Public Deputations and the rest of Public Administrations at all levels, political parties, business organizations, labor unions and the main companies and foundations. These informations -with both general and specialized character and served in text and audiovisual format- are one of the main information sources for mass media and press offices. Europa Press has headquarters in every Spanish Autonomous Community and correspondents in each provincial capital. This allows the news agency to offer a very concrete informative product from local and autonomic issues, which is of key importance for institutions and companies. Press offices hire Europa Press' services in order to be informed in real time about the general or concrete current situation of their working area. The agency also offers companies the possibility of publishing their own news in corporate webs and spread them through its intranet.  History  In 1953, the journalist and writer Torcuato Luca de Tena Brunet founded and individual company that was called 'Agencia Europa', with the aim of creating and spreading editorial material such as books, novels and brochures with pictures about summaries of successful theatre plays or movies. The name 'Europa' responds to the European vocation of this founding group. At the beginning, the name was accompanied with 'Documents and International reports'. In 1958 it was changed to 'Agencia Europa Press', as it is still called today. This project initially associated with Florentino P√©rez Embid, Andr√©s Rueda, Luis Valls, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de la Mora, Javier Garc√≠a Vinuesa, Antonio Font√°n and √Ångel Benito, among others. The agency has had four head offices, always in Madrid and the actual one is at Paseo de la Castellana. In 1963, Antonio Herrero Losada was named director, a post he held until his retirement from active journalism in 1989. That same year a big capital increase was made along with the change of the head office, leading to substantial growth over the next years. In 1966, Europa Press started its informative service, competing with agencies like Efe, Logos, Pyresa, Fiel or Mencheta. A key person entered in the agency in 1968: Francisco Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Heredia. His personal and professional activities avoided in 1969 the shutdown of company. At the same time, he strengthened the business project in the following years until it became the solid multimedia group that it is today. Despite the political pressures suffered, mainly in the second part of 1960s, specially from the Information and Tourism Ministry, directed by Manuel Fraga (he wanted the agency to merge with Efe and he even asked clients to end their contracts with Europa Press), the agency made it through in part thanks to Francisco Mart√≠n, that had been named managing director shortly before this conflict. Francisco Mart√≠n (1922-2011) kept playing a fundamental role in the company's growth during the next decades until the end of the 1990s when he delegated his functions to his descendants. In 1970, Europa Press started a new service that was called 'Economic Summary'. It was a text that gathered the most important political and economic information of the day and was later distributed by post to the clients. This way information was more easily transmitted because it saved part of the censorship that the official channels suffered at that time. During the 1970s, Europa Press achieved some of its major successes, such us giving the worldwide exclusive of the death of the dictator Francisco Franco and on the following year the designation of Adolfo Su√°rez as President of the Government The press coverage of the disease and death of Francisco Franco translated into the National Journalism Award in 1975. In the 1990s, the agency started its territorial expansion and opened business delegations in the 17 Spanish Autonomous Communities, each of it with its own informative service. This way, all the Spanish territory was covered with journalists in every provincial capital and correspondents in the main Spanish cities. At the same time, informative services were opened in all the official languages in Spain: Catalan, Basque, Valencian, Galician and Bable. In 2005, the platform 'Desayunos Informativos' was created. It was one of the first forums for debates in Spain. Presidents of the Government, ministers, presidents of Autonomous Communities, High Statal Institutions, foreign Prime Ministers have been some of the public figures that have participated in the ‚ÄòDesayunos‚Äô. En 2012, it was published that Europa Press has closed three years in negative equity because of the loss of clients and the reduction of its sponsorships -many of them were institutional or depended on public companies--. The agency implemented a strategy based on the control of expenses and on April 11 fired 7 workers, 36 hours after of knowing that Journalist Union of Madrid has called sindical elections in three companies of the group.  Areas  The Europa Press group is made up of several independent limited-liability companies, built around seven areas of business: * Europa Press Noticias * Europa Press Televisi√≥n * Europa Press Reportajes * Europa Press Comunicaci√≥n * Europa Press Internet * Europa Press Ediciones * Europa Press.Net  Personnel  * Antonio Herrero Losada: He was the director during years, and could show respect, freedom, the truth, and courageousness to the editors. It involved penalties which was about to have his job losen. When he retired in 1989, he wrote the history of the agency, but he couldn't finish it because he died in August 1992. * Jos√© Mario Armero Alc√°ntara: He was president of Europa Press during decades after the end of the Francoist Spain. He was a very important figure to the Spanish transition to democracy, and served to Juan Carlos I and Adolfo Su√°rez. Armero Alc√°ntar carried on writing the history of the agency which Herrero Losada started. * Francisco Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez Heredia: He was president of Junta de Fundadores, chief executive officer and then president of Europa Press after the death of Armero Alc√°ntara. Fern√°ndez Heredia administrated the resources of the agency. He sent a letter to Carrero Blanco so he could save the vanishing of the agency. At the beginning of 2007, Fern√°ndez Heredia planned to finish writing the history of the agency, but it was ended by Jes√∫s Fr√≠as Alonso.

He is best known for his novels (particularly Jampot Smith, Henry's War and Smith, As Hero) and for his stage adaptations of classic works, particularly a series of Maxim Gorky plays for the Royal Shakespeare Company. His novels were praised for their lyricism and for their \\"Chekhovian mixture of comic concision and pathos\\". Anthony Burgess, in The Novel Now said \\"Jeremy Brooks has come to considerable stature in Jampot Smith and Smith, as Hero: he has created one of the few really large picaresque characters in the post-war novel.\\" Life and work Jeremy Brooks was born in Southampton in 1926 and went to Brighton Grammar School until, with the onset of World War II, he was evacuated with his family to Llandudno in North Wales, where he attended John Bright school. School was followed immediately by military training and service in the Navy, where he saw the last years of the war from the deck of a minesweeper in the Mediterranean (an experience that provided material for his novel, Smith, As Hero). After the war Brooks went on a navy scholarship to Oxford, where his English tutor was C. S. Lewis. He then attended Camberwell School of Art, where his wife, the painter Eleanor Brooks (n√©e Nevile), was also a student (although they did not meet at that time). He and Eleanor were married in 1950 and, after a spell on a Houseboat on the Thames, they eventually set up home in a near-derelict and remote cottage in North Wales on the estate of Clough Williams Ellis (the architect and creator of the Portmeirion hotel), where his wife still lives today. Throughout the fifties, living in near-poverty with three young children, Brooks pursued his writing. Critical success came with his second novel, Jampot Smith (recently republished in the Library of Wales classics series). This led to opportunities for paid work and the family eventually moved to London, with the manuscript of his third novel (Henry‚Äôs War, 1962) lying on the back shelf of the car (where a bottle of his wife's ink slowly seeped into it for the duration of the journey, obliterating all but the edges of each page of tissue-thin typing paper ‚Äì a disaster that Brooks later said had resulted in a better book). Now settled in London, Brooks wrote his fourth novel (Smith, As Hero, 1964) and worked for New Statesman, The Sunday Times and the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych, becoming Literary Manager there in 1964. As such, he was closely involved with the important figures of the theatre world throughout much of the sixties and seventies, particularly Peter Hall and Trevor Nunn, but also David Jones, Terry Hands, Adrian Noble, Clifford Williams, David Hare, David Edgar. This was a period of great upheaval in establishment theatre, with ground-breaking productions coming thick and fast (Peter Brook's Midsummer Night's Dream and Marat-Sade; works by Harold Pinter and Edward Bond; As You Like It with an all-male cast; Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead) and the politics of the counter culture sometimes interfering with the smooth running of the RSC. For Brooks the writer, this was too much distraction and he left the RSC sometime in the early seventies to concentrate on his own projects (among them an unfinished manuscript that deals in a highly personal and semi-fictionalised way with his time at the RSC). During all this time and on through the eighties, Brooks directed his creative energies largely towards theatre and film projects. He had never made any money from his novels (not even from Smith As Hero which spent time on the best-seller lists) and now with a family of four children, he needed to earn. He wrote screenplays (Our Mother's House; Work is a Four Letter Word); television scripts for directors such as Karel Reisz and Ken Loach and a great number of important and memorable adaptations of classics for the stage (The Lower Depths, The Government Inspector (with Paul Scofield), Enemies (with a young Helen Mirren), The Forest, A Child's Christmas in Wales (co-written with Adrian Mitchell), The Cherry Orchard, Medea, The Wind in the Willows and many more). The majority of these were for the RSC, where he worked closely with the director David Jones, but in later life he formed a fruitful relationship with Theatre Clwyd at Mold. This took him back to North Wales, where he died in 1994. Throughout his life, Brooks also wrote poetry (as a schoolboy he had won an Eisteddfod poetry competition) and although during the 1950s many of his poems were published in poetry magazines such as Elegebra, he subsequently never sought its publication, poetry being, for him, a very personal and private pursuit. Moreover, only his earlier poetic work survives (collected in a privately published edition, Wales 1950, Rugosa Press, 2008), an unpublished collection of his poems written throughout the 1960s having been stolen and never recovered. Critical response Anthony Burgess, in The Novel Now, said \\"Jeremy Brooks has come to considerable stature in Jampot Smith and Smith, as Hero: he has created one of the few really large picaresque characters in the post-war novel.\\" Micheal Kustow, in his obituary for The Guardian, said \\"His fiction aspired to, and often achieved, a Chekhovian mixture of comic concision and pathos. Jampot Smith is a small classic about the delight and pain of sexual awakening; it will outlast its period and provincial setting.\\" In The Test of Time ‚Äì What makes a classic a classic? (Waterstone's, 1999), Adrian Mitchell chose Jampot Smith as one of his classics, referring to Brooks as \\"a very underestimated writer\\". The Irish Times wrote, 'Jampot Smith is exact, funny, sad and beautiful; it is, I think, a masterpiece.' Smith, As Hero Brooks's follow-up to Jampot Smith, Smith, As Hero, received glowing reviews in the national press in the UK and literary stardom seemed assured. As luck would have it, the novel then suffered a fatal blow when it was launched in the United States during a newspaper strike. The resulting lack of publicity has contributed to the book's near-invisibility, despite its being his most mature and accessible work. One reviewer, Isabel Quigley in The Sunday Telegraph, wrote: \\"The crashing of serio-comic novelists between two stools is a familiar sound to novel reviewers, since few funny novels with serious intentions manage to be either funny or serious enough. Many try to pull it off, for it looks so easy (think of the disarming simplicity of a book as deadly, deadpan and complex as 'A Handful of Dust' say). But few succeed. Among the few I would put Jeremy Brooks with his 'Smith, As Hero', sequel to the much-praised 'Jampot Smith'. It seems to me, though in a totally different style, quite as funny as the early Waugh, and with a flavour indescribably mixed, strong, attractive and alarming... ...It is part of Brooks‚Äôs extraordinary skill at mixing his levels of feeling, intensity and response that he can end this wildly comic novel with an appalling scene aboard a post-war immigrants' hell- ship to Palestine, and make it seem a part of all that has gone before. Smith has, by then, grown up a little.\\" The above is typical of the reviews he received at publication in the UK, yet perhaps Brooks himself contributed to burying this book. He had never been a good salesman of his most personal work (the novels and poems) and, in speaking of Smith, As Hero, he often lamented what he saw as a formal error in the book; this was a foray into metafiction with the introduction in a late chapter of a character called Jeremy Brooks (a device used two decades later by Martin Amis in Money). This experiment was partly driven by his desire to distance himself from the protagonist Bernard Smith, but soon after publication he came to think of it as a mistake ‚Äì a hole in what was otherwise a watertight ship. But it was too late. Great reviews did nothing to mollify him ‚Äì on the contrary, they disturbed him. Typically, he was being too hard on himself (and perhaps also on those reviewers who had failed to upbraid him for his perceived mistake). It may be that to some extent Brooks subsequently 'lost his voice', or his muse, as a novelist and, apart from the four novellas collected in Doing the Voices (1986), never published a major work of fiction again. There may have been another reason for his never having completed another novel: the period generally known as 'the sixties' had altered the world to such an extent that his voice, forged in wartime Britain, suddenly seemed outdated. The American beat was in the ascendant; literature had to be hip, had to address the new consciousness and speak to it in its own tones. Writers like Ken Kesey, Robert Stone (a close friend of Brooks), Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegutt, spoke the language that people wanted to hear.

He is credited as being the founder and a \\"pioneer\\" in the area of market research. Career Before joining the Curtis Publishing Company, Parlin acted as a schoolteacher in the state of Wisconsin. In 1911, he was hired by the Curtis Publishing Company in a job that had no clearly defined title, as the work he was doing had not previously been done.Nair, S.E., Market Research: Text and Cases, 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014, Parlin came up with the name \\"commercial research\\" for his work, which would later end up being changed to market research. The company had just bought out the magazine, Country Gentleman, but the owner of the company, Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis, had little knowledge about agriculture. Since much of the advertising in the Country Gentleman magazine was purchased by the agriculturalists, Parlin began researching agriculture in general. After six months of interviews with a number of people in the industry, he completed a 460-page survey that \\"revealed unsuspected facts about where agricultural tools were made, to whom they were sold, when, and where.\\" After this, Parlin carried out a study on \\"the market for almost everything in the nation's one hundred largest cities,\\" which involved 1,121 interviews across the nation, compiling all of the fundings in order to draw conclusions about the workings of the national market. His \\"pioneer report\\", Department Store Lines, was released in 1912 and it focused on the distinctions between convenience goods and shopping goods and how the marketer should focus on selling primarily shopping goods in order to obtain the highest profits. In 1914, Parlin released a five-volume study titled Automobiles. It focused on the future of the automobile age and \\"collected facts on manufacturing and distribution, on the influence of women on automobile purchase\\". The study predicted correctly that the number of grades and makes would be reduced in the future and it \\"envisaged the dimensions and even the shape of the automobile market.\\" This information resulted in an increase in advertising by automobile manufacturers, in order to obtain customers faster than their competitors in the burgeoning market for automobiles. Largely due to Parlin's success, other commercial organisations began creating Departments of Commercial Research including: United States Rubber Company in 1915 and Swift and Company in 1916. Foreseeing a need for \\"standardized definitions and common measures\\" after the release of Parlin's studies, the Audit Bureau of Circulations was formed in 1914 in order to regulate publisher's claims for newspaper and magazine circulations. During the 1920s, Parlin went on to found the \\"first commercial research company\\" with Donald M. Hobart, backed by the Curtis Publishing Company, called National Analysts. Parlin retired from the company in 1938 and was succeeded by Hobart. Legacy The Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award was established in 1945 by \\"the Philadelphia Chapter of the AMA and The Wharton School in association with the Curtis Publishing Company to honor persons who have made outstanding contributions to the field of marketing research.\\" It is meant to act as a memorial to Parlin, due to his creation of the field of market research.

His works were important in the development towards more naturalism in Flemish landscape painting.Abel Grimmer, An Allegory of Summer at Sphinx Fine Arts Life Grimmer was born and died in Antwerp. He learned to paint from his father, the landscape painter Jacob Grimmer. His father Jacob Grimmer had established a name for himself by imitating the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder on small panel pictures and selling these on the market at low prices. Abel Grimmer married Catharina Lescornet on 29 September 1591 and became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1592.Hans Devisscher. \\"Abel Grimmer.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 24 April 2014 He took over his father's workshop. He worked his whole career in Antwerp. The date of his death is not known exactly and is placed after 1620. Work The Tower of Babel He often signed and dated his panels. His earliest dated work dates from 1586 and his latest dated work reads \\"162\\", so it is dated 1620 or later.Abel Grimmer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He is principally known for his paintings in small format of country scenes, sometimes with a biblical theme. The works were at times in the form of roundels (i.e. in a round format). Many of his paintings were dedicated to the Four Seasons or the Months of the Year. The paintings were sometimes inspired by or even copied from prints by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Hans Bol. Abel's work generally shows a strong influence of Bruegel and Bol as well as of his own father's work. His series of the Twelve Months (dated 1592; held in the Chapelle Notre- Dame in Montfaucon-en-Velay) is an exact copy of Adriaen Collaert's prints made after paintings by Hans Bol and published by Hans van Luyck in 1585. The paintings Spring and Summer (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) are almost exact copies of two prints by Pieter van der Heyden after designs by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Abel Grimmer's work is characterised by the simplification and systemisation of figures and landscapes. His landscapes show splendid colour harmonies and a certain linearity, through their slightly schematized compositions and their tendency to represent buildings as geometric shapes. His work has been dismissed because of this simplification and its reliance on the work of others. However, it is this combination that enabled him to survive in the Antwerp marketplace. He managed to be so prolific because he had streamlined his technique. Each pictorial area of his landscapes was composed in a single color with little or no modulation. He applied minimal varnishing, which eliminated the effects of roundness and reflection. This stylization and codification of established landscape formulas allowed him to make these works almost as inexpensive and widely available as prints. Jacob Grimmer was one of the first Netherlandish artists to break with the tradition of the mountain landscape pioneered by Joachim Patinir, the founder of the so- called world landscape. Abel Grimmer rather depicted broad landscapes of the Flemish countryside characterised by naturalism and a close observation of nature. Church interior A favourite theme of Abel Grimmer was the Tower of Babel of which he produced several versions, clearly inspired by Pieter Bruegel the Elder's treatment of the same subject.Abel Grimmer, The Tower of Babel at Richard Green The subject is taken from the Book of Genesis 11:1-9. This narrates the story of the decision to build a city and a tower reaching into the heavens. The biblical character Nimrod was appointed to oversee the project's construction. This story was a rich source of subject matter for various late 16th and early 17th century Flemish painters. Their representations were inspired by the two works of 1563 by Pieter Bruegel the Elder on this subject matter (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam).Abel Grimmer, The Tower of Babel at Christie's The story of the Tower of Babel is in essence a reflection on human impiety and hubris, a moral message already implicit in both Bruegel's paintings. The architecture of the Tower of Babel in Grimmer's paintings of the subject echoes that of the Colosseum, which in the 16th-century symbolised the decay of imperial Rome. Grimmer's treatment of this subject can also be interpreted as a comment on the turbulent times in which he was living. His home country - the Spanish Netherlands - was at the time he created the paintings engaged in a struggle with the breakaway Protestant provinces in the north. The story of the Tower of Babel also tells about a world in which people speaking one language are suddenly riven with the incomprehension of many different languages. This paralleled the 16th century, when the once united Netherlands became divided between a Catholic south and a Protestant north which vigorously debated the interpretation of the bible and the role of the church.Abel Grimmer, The Tower of Babel at Johnny Van Haeften Ltd Abel Grimmer collaborated with several different figure painters who provided the staffage in his Babel paintings. Abel Grimmer also produced architectural paintings including church interiors such as the Interior of a Gothic Church with a Franciscan Monk Preaching (sold at Sotheby's in London on 9 March 1983). His interest in perspective and the use of a golden light anticipate the work of the Dutch painter of church interiors Pieter Saenredam. His paintings of interior views, such as A Ball (Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire) and Jesus in the House of Martha and Mary (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) show Abel's interest in portraying interior space. Both works are clearly inspired by Hans Vredeman de Vries who also painted a Jesus in the House of Martha and Mary (Royal Collection). He relied on other artists such as Frans Francken the Younger to paint the staffage in his architectural paintings. He would occasionally paint church interiors without staffage. An example is the Church interior (Galen Galerie). This depicts a church interior without any figures and shows the artist's interest in architecture and atmosphere.Abel Grimmer, Kircheninterieur at Galen Galerie Earlier scholars suggested that Abel was also an architect on the basis of two autograph architectural drawings depicting respectively an elevation of the gable of Antwerp Cathedral and a church gable with a Gothic spire.

It was deemed worthy to be elevated to a Diocesan Shrine on November 7, 2007 by Bishop Daniel R. Jenky, and dissolved as a parish. He has granted a partial indulgence to those making a pious pilgrimage to the Shrine. The Shrine complex consists of the church, the rectory and a school building. Bishop Jenky designated the Shrine as a Holy Door pilgrimage site for the Holy Year of Mercy from November 8, 2015 through November 20, 2016, as announced by Pope Francis.  History  In 1904, Father Charles Zachini from the Diocese of Loreto, Italy arrived in La Salle and ministered to the Italian-American community for the Illinois towns of La Salle, Peru, and Oglesby. The first Masses were said in a private house on the corner of Third and Creve Coeur streets. Two months later, a house was purchased on the corner of Fourth and Bucklin, converted into a small church and dedicated as the Church of the Immaculate Conception on December 8, 1905. Two years after the dedication, Zachini was recalled to Italy to be made a canon of the Basilica of Loreto and the church was closed. For 18 years the Italian-American community was without its own parish until Father Peter Delo arrived in 1925 and established the Queen of the Holy Rosary church with the permission of Bishop Edmund M. Dunne. The first Masses were said in the Knights of Columbus hall. On the first Sunday in October, 1925, the Queen of the Holy Rosary Church was dedicated in a converted house at 529 Fourth Street and had a membership of 35 families. This is next to the site of the current structure. In 1936, Father Simon D. Bernardi was appointed pastor of the parish. He was originally from Pievepelago in the province of Modena, Italy and ordained June 12, 1932 in the United States. Parish collections averaged US$30 per week. From 1936 to 1944, the debt of the parish was paid off, and fund-raising began for a new building for the growing parish. At that time architect A. F. Moratz of Bloomington, Illinois was contracted to design a Neo-Italian Renaissance-style church. To this end, the parish contributed to the building fund from 1944 to 1954. Ground was broken on May 16, 1954 with construction under the direction of Father Bernardi; total cost was approximately $300,000. The new church was dedicated on October 7, 1956 with an Apostolic Blessing granted by Pope Pius XII. Monsignor Francesco Roberti, Secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Council and personal representative of the Pope to the Tenth U.S. CCD Congress participated in the Mass. Throughout the years various improvements were made. The rectory was completed in 1958. In the spring of 1958, the old church-rectory was demolished. On July 21, 1959, the parish became free of debt. In November 1965 an Italian-made mosaic was installed on the back walls of the main and side altars. In 1968 a Catechetical Center was completed. This required the purchase of the remaining half block of property west of the church and the demolition of the buildings. Father Bernardi was elevated to Privy Chamberlain with the title of Very Reverend by Pope Pius XII in 1956, and elevated to Domestic Prelate with the title of Reverend Monsignor in 1963 by Pope John XXIII. On October 5, 1975, after 39 years serving the parish, he died in the sacristy before a Pontifical High Mass to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the parish. Succeeding pastors have been Edward Bawiec (1975 - 1986), Dale Maloy (1986 - 2003), Gordon Pillon (2003 - 2006), Robert Rayson (2006 - 2012), Antonio Dittmer (2012 - 2016), and Paul Carlson (2016 - present).http://www.lasallecatholic.org/  Building detail  Queen of the Holy Rosary Memorial Shrine - Interior * The building has a steel structure with an exterior of Bedford stone with random ashlar. * The capitals are of Corinthian style and the exterior doors are bronze. * All floors are terrazzo. * The interior contains 15 different marbles from Italy, France and North Africa. * The marble altars and railings were carved in Pietrasanta, Italy by the laboratory of Felice Bertozzi and installed personally by the artisans. * There are numerous venetian mosaics, the most notable being the replica of Our Lady of Pomeii, Patroness of the Parish, above the center of the main altar.

Integers modulo p * On 2 Dec 2019, Fabrice Boudot, Pierrick Gaudry, Aurore Guillevic, Nadia Heninger, Emmanuel Thom√©, and Paul Zimmermann announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo the 240-digit (795 bit) prime RSA-240 + 49204 (the first safe prime above RSA-240). This computation was performed simultaneously with the factorization of RSA-240, using the Number Field Sieve algorithm and the open-source CADO- NFS software. The discrete logarithm part of the computation took approximately 3100 core-years, using Intel Xeon Gold 6130 CPUs as a reference (2.1GHz). The researchers estimate that improvements in the algorithms and software made this computation three times faster than would be expected from previous records after accounting for improvements in hardware.

The team works to diagnose his problem as his condition worsens, with only House remaining cynical about his heroism. Masters insists it must be an infection, but House dismisses the idea. Jack, who is away from home most of the time touring with his band, decides to give it up to be with his wife and daughter.

He lies in a futile attempt to avoid a dinner with Cuddy, Arlene, and Wilson, even though it is Cuddy's birthday. The dinner is very uncomfortable for all. House's solution is to secretly drug both Arlene and Wilson into unconsciousness. The next day, before he is forced to apologize, Arlene lets slip that she thinks she just drank too much. She tells House that she approves of his relationship with Cuddy. Then, as she is leaving, she remarks that she does not like children because she always catches diseases from them. House realizes that Daisy has given Jack chicken pox, a very serious disease when first contracted as an adult. When questioned, Jack's wife Eva reveals she has kept her daughter out of school because of an outbreak, but Daisy is still a carrier. Jack turns out to be one of the 5% who do not show the typical symptoms. It is easy enough to cure, once properly diagnosed. As Jack recovers, he informs Eva (guest star Sprague Grayden) that the band needs him for just a few more performances. In private, Eva tells a puzzled Taub that this is what Jack always does. He has not been changed at all by his experience. Taub goes home and tells his wife that they should get a divorce; he cannot give up his philandering, and it hurts her so much, she has turned to an online relationship for emotional comfort.

His rural scenes and landscapes of views around Antwerp marked an important development in 16th century Flemish landscape painting away from the world landscape with its fantastic panoramas and whimsically-shaped gigantic rocks towards greater simplicity and authenticity. His work influenced the next generation of Flemish landscape painters. Grimmer was a capable colorist who was able to create harmonic landscapes by using realistic colours and atmospheric values effectively.Jacob Grimmer, Allegory of Spring at De Jonckheere Gallery Life Jacob Grimmer was born in Antwerp as the son of the small merchant Nicolaas and Elisabeth Cops.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 297-300 According to the early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander, Grimmer first learned to paint landscapes from Matthys Cock and later from Christian van den Queborn, both of Antwerp.Jaques Grimmaer, landscape painter of Antwerp in: Karel van Mander, Schilder-boeck, 1604 There are no written sources, which confirm these apprenticeships. Landscape with figures The only documentary evidence relating to Grimmer's training is his registration in 1539 under the name Iaques Grimmaer in the liggeren of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a student of Gabriel Bouwens. It is therefore not certain that Grimmer in fact was a pupil of Matthys Cock and Christian van den Queborn.Virginie D'haene, De deconstructie van het oeuvre van Mathijs Cock. Volume 1: Tekst, Dissertation submitted to obtain the degree of Master of Art Sciences, Promotor: prof. Dr. M. Martens, University of Ghent, Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, Academic year 2007-2008, p. 17 Grimmer became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1547. Grimmer married Lucia van de Wouwer in April 1548. Of the four children born out of this marriage Abel became an important landscape and architectural painter. There is some disagreement among art historians as to whether or not Grimmer traveled to Italy as many of his artist contemporaries did.Peter C. Sutton, 'Jacob Grimmer biography' at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum He bought a house in the centre of Antwerp where he set up his studio. He was known for painting after nature in the areas around Antwerp. As early as 1550 Jacob Grimmer was praised by the famous Italian art historian Vasari as one of the best landscape painters of his time.Hans Devisscher. \\"Jacob Grimmer.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 12 February 2016 Karel van Mander described Grimmer as 'such an outstanding landscape painter that in some respects I do not know a better one, so lively and lovely were his skies'.Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, University of Pennsylvania Press, 31 Jan 2012, p. 188-189 Grimmer's art was appreciated not only by his contemporaries but also by artists of the next century. Both Pieter Lastman and his famous pupil, Rembrandt, owned landscapes by Grimmer. Rembrandt's inventory of 1656 included a winter landscape by Jacob Grimmer.Peter C. Sutton, 'Jacob Grimmer, A Winter Landscape with a Village, Skaters on a Frozen River, and Hunters in the Foreground' at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum A winter landscape with a village, skaters on a frozen river, and hunters in the foreground Jacob Grimmer was an active member of the local chamber of rhetoric Violieren where he was celebrated as a poet and author of comic writings.Jacob Grimmer (Antwerp 1525/6-before 1590), Summer at Christie's He died before May 1590 in Antwerp. Work =General= Jacob Grimmer was principally a painter of landscapes and winter scenes although he also painted some religiously themed works such as the Tower of Babel and genre works.Christa Gr√∂ssinger, 'North- European panel paintings: catalogue of Netherlandish & German paintings before 1600 in English churches & colleges', Harvey Miller, 1992, p. 265 He often returned to the subject of the Four Seasons and the Twelve Months. His earliest dated work was dated to 1546 and his latest dated work to 1589.Jacob Grimmer at The Netherlands Institute for Art History He was known for working directly from nature as was reported by Karel van Mander. His output was large as he relied on a large workshop, which produced small-scale panels in a standardized production process. His son Abel further streamlined this mass production process. =Significance of his work= Jacob has often been regarded as an imitator of Pieter Brueghel the Elder who recreated Brueghel's artistic innovations on small panels and supplied these to the market at low prices. Grimmer's landscapes did at the same time constitute a further development in the landscape genre. Grimmer broke away from the earlier Flemish tradition of the so-called 'world landscape' initiated by Joachim Patinir. The term world landscape is used in art historical literature for a landscape composition, which shows an imaginary panoramic landscape with mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings from an elevated viewpoint and usually includes a small-scale Biblical or historical narrative but the figures comprising this narrative element are dwarfed by their surroundings. Entrance to a village with peasants carousing In his earliest landscape drawing of a View over a tree-covered hill towards a village on a river (1573, Kunsthalle Hamburg) and in the series of paintings of the Four Seasons (1577, Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) Jacob Grimmer showed a preference for depicting realistic flat Flemish landscapes with villages and farmhouses and populated with rural residents. The small figures in these scenes are set in graduated zones of recession along rolling hills towards a horizon in the middle of the panel. These landscapes with figures and small anecdotal scenes are rendered in a naturalist manner. Grimmer abandoned the contrived world landscape of the earlier generation in favour of a simplicity and authenticity never seen before. His landscapes develop the scenery continuously from the foreground to the horizon. His compositions are broken up in large zones of uniform colour that contrast with each other. He chose more realistic colours than those used in the world landscapes of his predecessors. He used well-constructed, atmospheric values in order to arrive at a unity of composition. He had his own style of representing trees, which rise thinly against the background with spare crowns of foliage and each leaf drawn individually. View over a tree- covered hill towards a village on a river Grimmer's work stands out in its ability to provide a simple and sincere view of everyday life. In this attention for rural life Grimmer's work shows a parallel with the landscapes ascribed to the Master of the Small Landscapes which were first published around 1560 and signaled a move away from the world landscape with its religious scenes towards an engagement with the real life in the countryside. Unlike Pieter Brueghel the Elder who had a grim view of peasants, Grimmer held a much sunnier view of peasant life than did his fellow painter. Grimmer often accentuated the lighter, humoristic side of rural life as seen in his A Winter Landscape with a Village, Skaters on a Frozen River, and Hunters in the Foreground (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum), which shows a skater on the ice who falls over and reveals her bare buttocks. Although his stylistic development is still little understood, in his late works anecdotal details decreased markedly and were replaced by intimate views of the landscape. These late works anticipate the type of forest landscape made popular by artists of the next generation, such as David Vinckboons and the artists of the Frankenthal school. View of the Kiel at Antwerp Jacob‚Äôs extant pictures show explicit connection to the region around Antwerp. Some of his views of Antwerp adhere to the \\"town-and-country\\" format, a kind of combination of a rural view with a city view. An example is his panoramic View of the Kiel (1578, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) where the city appears only on the far-right distance. Another example is the View of the Scheldt near Antwerp (1587, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp), which depicts a somewhat different aspect of country pastimes. Only in the distant horizon are the towers of Antwerp visible.Gibson (2000), p, 20 Grimmer's work was influential on the next generation of Flemish landscape painters including his son Abel as well as Gillis van Coninxloo, Jan Brueghel the Younger and Jan Wildens. =Collaborations= As was common practice in the Antwerp art sector, Jacob Grimmer often collaborated with other specialist artists. Collaborations with Marten van Cleve and Gillis Mostaert who painted the staffage in his landscapes are recorded. Collaborations with Mostaert appear to have been particularly frequent. An example is a pair of landscapes representing 'Spring' and 'Winter', which may have been part of a cycle on the seasons (Auctioned at Sotheby's, London on 3 December 2008, lot 7). In this pair of paintings the artists depict everyday life by filling every corner with some anecdotal detail. They and their workshops repeated these compositions on several further occasions and numerous smaller repetitions, of varying degrees of quality, are known.Jacob Grimmer (circa 1525 ‚Äì after 1592) and Gillis Mostaert (1528‚Äì1598), Mountainous landscape with peasants working on the land and travellers with a carriage and Winter landscape with travellers and people on a frozen river at Sotheby's =Prints= Some of Grimmer‚Äôs landscape designs were turned into prints. A set of 12 Landscape Views in the Environs of Antwerp were engraved by Adriaen Collaert. The set was published probably in Antwerp in the 1580s. The prints resemble his painted series of the Months and Seasons. He seems to take some liberty with the actual scenery and makes the landscape much more dramatic and hilly than was actually the case in the environs of Antwerp. Procris dies in the arms of Cephalus Another series of 24 views of sites around Brussels engraved by Hans Collaer and first issued in Antwerp in the 1580s is likely also based on drawings by Grimmer. These prints show a more topographical interest, and unlike the Antwerp series, clearly identify the location depicted on both the prints and the five surviving drawings.Gibson (2000), p. 23-25 Jacob Grimmer also designed a set of four roundels of Landscapes with Cephalus and Procris. They were engraved and published by Philip Galle. The first two of the prints were based on the landscape backgrounds in two drawings with Hagar, Ishmael and the Angel (1586, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). Both the mythological subjects as well as the scenery with its rolling hills and punctuated by a few tall trees, reveal their debt to Hieronymus Cock's 1558 landscape print cycle of 'Landscapes with Biblical and Mythological Scenes' after designs by his brother Matthys Cock.

When he learned that it would take more than a week to evacuate the surviving orphans due to the lack of military transport planes, Macauley chartered a Boeing 747 from Pan American World Airways and arranged for 300 orphaned children to leave the country, paying for the trip by mortgaging his house. Macauley founded Americares in 1982, a year after he organized shipments of humanitarian aid to Poland at the behest of Pope John Paul II and had organized an airlift to provide medicine to victims of the Lebanese Civil War. Accepting no pay, he served as chief executive officer of the charity until 2002, distributing material collected from companies to people in need in trouble spots around the world.

Plot In 1963, an aging Philip Marlowe (James Caan) is newly married to young socialite Laura Parker (Dina Meyer). The private investigator leaves his Los Angeles apartment behind and sets up a new base of operations in Poodle Springs, an upscale community in the desert a couple hours from L.A. (a parody of Palm Springs), where he and his wife intend to live. \\"I don't do divorces,\\" Marlowe impatiently explains to potential clients in a peaceful, relatively crime-free town. His rich wife Laura would prefer that Philip get out of this line of work entirely and live off her money or come into business with P.J. Parker (Joe Don Baker), her politically connected father, but Marlowe isn't ready to permanently hang up his gun. As might be expected, crime follows Marlowe wherever he may be. While looking into a matter at a gambling club just beyond the city limits, Marlowe sets out to find a photographer with a gambling debt and is soon mixed up in blackmail and murder. Larry Victor, the photographer (David Keith), is a bigamist, two- timing Laura's wealthy friend Muffy (Julia Campbell) with a drug addict named Angel (Nia Peeples), and he is threatening to expose photos of a former stripper (La Joy Farr) who is now running with Muffy's billionaire father, Clayton Blackstone (Brian Cox). As things progress, Marlowe realizes that his new father-in-law is involved in a land swindle on such a massive scale that it could end up altering the California/Nevada state border. And any further snooping on the detective's part could quickly put an end to his wedded bliss.

Location  The L√§rchegg forms the mighty northeastern buttress of the Wilder Kaiser; its rock faces towering over the Kaiserbach valley. It belongs to the impressive backdrop of the Ostkaiser (\\"East Kaiser\\") and appears from all sides as a narrow rock pyramid. To the south it is joined to the high peaks of the Ackerlspitze and Maukspitze.  Approaches  The normal route to the summit of the L√§rchegg is challenging and should not be underestimated. Only experienced mountaineers with good fitness, sure-footedness, a head for heights and climbing agility should risk the ascent. The base in the Kaiserbach valley is the pine oil distillery (Latschen√∂lbrennerei, 900 m) between the Fischbachalm and the Griesner Alm (car parks on the toll road from Griesenau). The signposted mountain path climbs steeply into the Kleine Griesner Tor, a rock-strewn cirque. From there it branches off, unsigned, to the left; the main path carries on to the Fritz Pflaum Hut. From here to the summit there are only occasional and very faded signs (as at 2009) and the danger of falling rocks is ever present. The route traces a way roughly through the middle of an extremely steep, unstable scree slope to about 1,850 metres on the rock face of the summit block. There the climbing path leads up out of the cirque and runs across steep terrain (Schrofen), bands of rock and steep gullies. At the most difficult spot a cable has been fixed to which climbers must attach themselves. Immediately thereafter, is a challenging, unsecured grade II climb. In front of a rocky ledge (view over to the Chiemsee) the route runs right (view of St. Johann) and then over the north ar√™te to the summit cross. Three hours should be allowed for the whole climb, the descent on this route takes 2.5 hours.

He is mainly remembered for the crushing remark by Daniel O'Connell that McClelland was no example to his profession either as a barrister or a judge. Biography He was the son of James McClelland of Millmount, County Down. He attended Dublin University, entered Middle Temple in 1787, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1790. He became the Member of Parliament for Randalstown in 1798, and was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1801, as a reward for his support for the Act of Union 1801. He was raised to the Bench in 1803 as Baron of the Exchequer, (rather against his own wish, since at 35 he felt he was too young for high office), and served to his retirement in 1830. He married Charlotte Thompson of County Louth in 1797. They are buried at Ballymascanlon, where a memorial was erected to them. In 1819 he was accused of judicial misconduct in ordering soldiers to clear the public out of his courtroom: but the House of Commons decided not to pursue the matter, since the allegations, even if true, did not amount to misconduct.Volcansek, Mary L. Judicial Misconduct- a Cross-National Comparison University of Florida Press 1996 p.76 Daniel O'Connell, who despised most of the Irish judges of his time, had a particularly low opinion of McClelland. Although no precise date can be given, historians accept the truth of the story that McClelland saw O'Connell sitting in Court in a case he was not briefed in, in the apparent hope that a younger barrister would ask him to assist him in conducting the case. McClelland said that he had never behaved in such a way as a barrister: O'Connell sternly replied that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, and he did not propose to take directions from him as a judge.O'Faolain, Sean King of the Beggars-a life of Daniel O'Connell 1938 Mercier Press Edition p.97 References 1768 births 1831 deaths Irish MPs 1798‚Äì1800 Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Antrim constituencies Solicitors-General for Ireland People from County Down Barons of the Irish Exchequer ","title":"James McClelland (Solicitor-General)"},{"id":"30250927","title":"Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1980"},{"id":"30250942","title":"Coupe de la Ligue (ice hockey)"},{"id":"30250948","text":"Kole District is a district in Northern Uganda.

General or collective references * In the 2011 movie Immortals starring Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke, the Titans are locked away in Mount Tartarus until they are released by King Hyperion using the Epirus Bow. The Titans look like Gods but have dark orange helmets and their skin is a rock color. There appear to be more Titans in the film than in actual mythology. * In the Disney 1997 animated film Hercules there are five Titans. Four of them embody the four classical elements: The Rock Titan, The Ice Titan, The Lava Titan, and the Tornado Titan. A fifth Titan, the one-eyed Cyclops, is not associated with any element. They terrorize the earth until Zeus imprisons them; however, Hades later releases them to aid in his attempt to usurp Zeus. These Titans bear little similarity to their mythological counterparts. Later, in the animated series, the Titan Kronos is mentioned. *In the video game franchise Kingdom Hearts, the four elemental titans from the movie Hercules appear as reoccurring bosses. In the first game, only the Rock Titan and Ice Titan make an appearance. The Rock Titan is fought at the final round of the Hades cup, ranking higher than Hades him self, who was fought ten rounds earlier. In the international version of kingdom hearts and in the Final Mix version, upon defeating the Rock Titan, the gold match becomes available, allowing the main character, Sora, to fight the Ice Titan in a one on one fight. In Kingdom hearts 2, the Rock Titan makes a brief cameo in a cutscene that plays when first arriving at the Olympus Coliseum, in which Hercules bests the titan in combat and throws it into sky until it can‚Äôt be seen anymore. All four titans also appear on the titan cup trophy obtained after completing the titan cup. In Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, Aqua fights Hades in final round of the torment. Hades brings along help in the form of the Ice Colossus. Aqua defeats the two of them on her own, upon which Hades states ‚ÄúI knew that snow cone wouldn‚Äôt cut it, I need a real Titan.‚Äù Revealing that the Ice Colossus was just an inferior copy of the Ice Titan. In Kingdom Hearts: re:coded, the Rock and Ice Titans once again both appear as boss fights in the Olympus Coliseum. In Kingdom Hearts 3, Hades uses the four Titans to conjure mount Olympus, as he did in the movie Hercules. The Rock Titan is the first of the Titans that Sora fights. The Titan is fought that the summit of Mount Olympus, set there to prevent Sora and Hercules from reaching Hades and the other three Titans. The Ice and Lava Titans are fought together at Zeus's throne room. The two had trapped Zeus in a cooled lava cone, as they did in the movie Hercules. The Tornado Titan is the last Titan that Sora and Hercules fight. It is fought atop the clouds above the throne room and uses the Ice and Lava Titans below to fight Sora. Afterwards, all four Titans confront Sora together, but before they could do anything, Hercules freed Zeus, who threw a lightning bolt at the Titans. Hercules then grabs the Tornado Titan and pulls the other three into it before then throwing them into space and exploding. *In the 1981 film Clash of the Titans, the Kraken, actually an entity from Norse mythology, is presented as \\"the last Titan\\". It also describes the usage of the head of Medusa, who is actually a Gorgon, to fight him, as \\"a titan against another titan\\". In the 2010 remake, the Titans are mentioned at the beginning, when it is claimed Hades created the Kraken to defeat them. Kronos appears in the sequel Wrath of the Titans, where Ares turned to darkness and planned to revive his grandfather with Zeus' life force. * The Italian sword-and-sandal film Arrivano i titani shows the Titans first as prisoners in Tartarus, but they are later liberated by Zeus to take down the megalomanic King Cadmus. * The video game series, God of War, which is based on Greek mythology, features many of the Titans, mainly Gaia, Cronos and Atlas. They attempt to reignite their Great War with the Olympians with the help of a Spartan warrior named Kratos, who became the God of War after killing Ares. * The Titans appeared in an episode of Charmed titled \\"Oh My Goddess\\" where Cronus, Demtrieus and Meta battled the Charmed Ones who became Goddesses. Eventually, the Titans were destroyed by Piper Halliwell. * The Titans occasionally appear or are mentioned in Renaissance Pictures' Hercules/Xena franchise. In the Xena: Warrior Princess episode \\"The Titans,\\" many Titans (far more than in the actual myths) were turned to stone by the Olympians, which Crius, Hyperion and Theia seek to undo. In the Hercules: The Legendary Journeys episode \\"Let There Be Light,\\" it is said that the Titans successfully defeated Dahak, but the battle left them too weak to resist the Olympians. Also, in the Hercules series finale \\"Full Circle,\\" Oceanus, Helios and Atlas appear, having made a deal with Ares to destroy the Olympians but spare him. * Titan appears as a regular Earth-based summon in the video game series Final Fantasy. *The Titans are a race of Eternals (gods) in the Warcraft universe. They are depicted as tall figures with metallic-colored skin. They defeated the Old Gods, who originally ruled Azeroth long ago, before the invasion of the Burning Legion. * In the tabletop game, Warhammer 40,000, Titans are phenomenally large war machines, capable of laying waste to entire armies and cities with their colossal weapons. They are often referred to as \\"god-Machines\\" by Imperial forces, for they are virtually unstoppable (generally the only threat to a Titan on the battlefield is a Chaos Titan, or similar constructs created by other races). * The largest class of combat vessels in the MMORPG Eve Online are classified as 'titans', and several of the Gallente faction vessels are named after Greek deities. * In the series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the Titans are the main villains, attempting to take over Olympus and rule civilization once more, after most of them were imprisoned in the Underworld. *In DC Comics the Titans were exiled to another world after their defeat, which they called New Cronos.

They call themselves Titans and their reign the Time of Titans. * The popular Age of Empires Spin-off, Age of Mythology at first only contains three civilizations and mythologies: The Norse, the Greeks, and the Egyptians. Added in later in an equally-popular expansion, a fourth civilization was added, Atlantis, which worshipped the Titans. They are portrayed, as a whole, largely neutral with some Titans even switching sides at some points in the game for no reason. There are three Major Titans that can be worshipped: Chronos, Gaia, and Ouranos. Gaia is shown generally as good, Chronos as evil. Ouranos is mostly portrayed as a good force, but at one point in the game, his followers are on the evil side, however later still being the major god of the protagonists in one of the final battles. * In the Br√ºtal Legend video game, Titans are a race of benevolent creatures who invented music and left it for the modern world. * In the Dennou Boukenki Webdiver, there is the final giant robot named Ditalion, which based on a Titan. * The primary antagonists in the manga and anime series Attack on Titan are called \\"Titans\\" and are depicted as a race of mute giants that attack and eat humans on sight. In the series, the Titans had driven humanity to the brink of extinction, forcing the last humans to take refuge in a single medieval nation (Paradis) surrounded by three concentric walls. * In the manga Saint Seiya Episode.G, the Titans are important villains, attempting to rule civilization once more, and Leo Aiolia and the Gold Saints are assigned to stop them. * The videogame Titan Quest tells the story of how the Telkine manage to cut off the gods from the mortal realms and attempt to free Typhon (identified in the game as a Titan) to have him assault Mount Olympus, with the player being a Greek soldier rising to the challenge and defending the world from the onslaught of mythological beasts and monsters. * The videogame franchise Borderlands features various references to the Titans throughout each installment in the series. In the story, four characters called Vault Hunters end up on a planet called Pandora to search for a mythical alien Vault. The Vault is said to contain a cache of rare and powerful weapons. The Vault Hunters aren‚Äôt the only ones after this legendary stash. Among the others are the Atlas and Hyperion Corporations. The Hyperion Corporation builds a massive, H-shaped space station in Pandora‚Äôs orbit called Helios on which a fair portion of gameplay takes place in the third game of the franchise, Borderlands The Pre-Sequel. One of the playable characters for this game is a ‚Äúgladiator‚Äù known as Athena, who is an ex-employee of the now non- existent Atlas Corporation. * The videogame Catacomb Abyss (1992) features a level called The Battleground of the Titans, with the two titan races being trolls and demons.

In the 2008 game Chains of Olympus, Atlas (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) is freed from his prison in Tartarus by Persephone in order to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World; Kratos destroys her and chains Atlas to the world, cursing him to hold it on his shoulders forever. In the 2007 game God of War II, while seeking The Sisters of Fate, Kratos is caught by Atlas (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) after falling down the Great Chasm battling Icarus. After breaking his chains, he attempts to kill Kratos, but is convinced to help him and helps him across the Great Chasm, wishing him luck and granting him the last of his magic, Atlas Quake. * In Rick Riordan's The Titan's Curse (of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series), Atlas is freed from the burden of the sky by various ways of tricking people to carry it, but near the end Percy and Artemis force him back under the Sky, though he kills his daughter the nymph Zoe in battle. He was the main antagonist of the book. He appears in The Last Olympian and tells the other Titans one of them should take his burden so he can fight, but is told that due to his failure Kronos is keeping him there. * One of the models of Ford, Ford Atlas was named after the Titan. * The wizard SHAZAM gains Stamina from Atlas, and grants it to Captain Marvel (DC Comics) *Name of weapons manufacturer in the video game Borderlands (2009) and sequel Borderlands 3 (2019) =Coeus= * Coeus (as Koios) makes a brief appearance in The House of Hades, the penultimate book of The Heroes of Olympus. He speaks with his brother Iapetus, who he does not realize has abandoned the Titans and is now aiding and abetting their enemies. Koios claims that eventually the Titans would rule the cosmos once more, despite the fact that he and his brethren were defeated by the Olympians twice. He seems to feel disdain for his siblings, the Gigantes. =Crius= * He appears in Hercules and Xena ‚Äì The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus where he is depicted as the Wind Titan. * In episode 7 of Xena: Warrior Princess, The Titans, Crius is awoken by Gabrielle alongside Theia and Hyperion. * Crius (as Krios) is the main hero in the 1962 sword-and-sandal film Arrivano I Titani. * Crius (as Krios) very briefly appears in the last Percy Jackson and the Olympians book, The Last Olympian. When the other Titans march to invade Manhattan, Krios is left behind to guard Mount Tamalpais, the location of the Titans' base, Othrys (named after their original home, Mount Othrys). While The Last Olympian doesn't say what happens to him, The Lost Hero (the first book of The Heroes of Olympus, the sequel series to Percy Jackson and the Olympians) reveals Othrys was invaded by the Roman demigods of Camp Jupiter, and Krios was defeated by Jason Grace. Krios reappears in the fourth book, The House of Hades. In the book, he and Hyperion are guarding the Doors of Death. He expresses the desire to strike back at Jason. In the end, his brother Iapetus (as Bob) tricks him into expressing doubts about serving their mother Gaea. Krios and Hyperion are destroyed by Tartarus. =Cronus/Saturn= * In the Sailor Moon meta series, Sailor Saturn is one of the lead characters. Sailor Saturn's powers are mostly based on Roman mythology, in which Saturn is the god of the harvest. As such, her primary role is that of the destroyer, with her ultimate attack being the ability to destroy a planet in one move although it would take her life. * Appears in the God of War video game series (spelled Cronos in series). In the 2005 game God of War, he is featured roaming the Desert of Lost Souls with Pandora's Temple (which holds Pandora's Box) chained to his back as punishment for his role in the Great War.

The species is endemic to South America. Geographic range The Chaco tortoise is mainly found in Argentina, but also in Bolivia and Paraguay, mainly within the Chaco and Monte ecoregions. Its distribution is mainly limited by temperature-related variables, and precipitation in the reproductive period. Taxonomy The scientific name for this species, Chelonoidis chilensis, is misleading because it is not native to Chile. It occurs mainly in Argentina, Bolivia and neighboring Paraguay. When the species was first described by Gray in 1870, he mistakenly thought that Mendoza was in Chile instead of Argentina, thus the misnomer. Sclater corrected Gray's mistake in the same year. However, the rules of nomenclature give precedence to the name chilensis, even though it was based on an erroneous assumption, and the name has persisted. Description The carapace of C. chilensis can measure up to 43.3 cm (but usually less than 25 cm) in a straight line, and may be either totally yellowish brown or have dark-brown to black rings surrounding a tan center on each scute. Specimens found farther south tend to be much larger than those found in farther north populations. The rim of the shell is slightly serrated and has a dark wedge of pigment at the back edge of each scute. The plastron may be uniformly yellowish-brown or have a dark triangular wedge along the seams of each scute. The head, limbs and tail are greyish to yellowish-brown, with the front of each forelimb covered with large, angular scales and each thigh featuring several enlarged tubercles. Diet Like all tortoise species, the Chaco tortoise is primarily herbivorous, consuming grasses, shrubs, fruits, and cactus pads. Species status There is only one recognized species. However, some researchers believe C. chilensis should be divided into three species: C. chilensis, C. petersi, and C. donosobarrosi. Some support C. donosobarrosi as a subspecies (C. chilensis donosobarrosi). There is research to indicate that it may qualify as a separate species, while C. petersi may just be a variant of C. chilensis, the variances being clinal variations in adjacent populations. However, these taxa mentioned have all been formally synonymised and accepted. The morphological variation is explainable as a factor of elevation. Historically, these have been viewed as separate taxa, with little work done to confirm or deny it. Subsequent molecular analysis has found little to no genetic variation.Turtle Taxonomy Working Group (van Dijk PP, Iverson JB, Rhodin AGJ, Shaffer HB, Bour R). 2014.

The Head Patrol Officer of Katsushika, stationed at the police box in front of Kameari Park. Hails from Asakusa, Tait≈ç, Tokyo. \\"Ryo-san\\" is a 36-year-old police officer with the personality of a 12-year-old. His laziness at work is matched only by his zeal and cleverness in hatching money-making schemes, the fruits of which are invariably squandered on toys, gadgets, and cheap entertainment. He is the stereotypical street-smart \\"shitamachi\\" type: sporting a crew cut, stomping about in ratty sandals (even in uniform), and being narrow-minded toward the outside world, as he makes his rounds on a creaky old bicycle. At the same time, he is a super-otaku, up on all the latest fads in popular culture and consumer technology. While most of his interests are juvenile (such as videogames and collectibles), he also indulges in more typically salaryman-type pastimes such as drinking, pachinko, and gambling (especially horse-racing). Despite his undisciplined lifestyle, he possesses superhuman strength and stamina, which he is forced to depend on at times. Ryotsu is a bachelor and seems relatively uninterested in women, yet occasionally attracts the attention of na√Øve young female acquaintances, though never with any eventual success. He travels to Hashutsujo by his bicycle named Chidori. He has a younger brother named Kinjiro who wears glasses and runs a successful law firm. * Voiced by: Mitsuru Miyamoto (TV), Toshiyuki Morikawa (SP), Akira Kamiya ('85 Jump Festival Anime), Mokomichi Hayami (Live Action TV Series) : Born December 24.

He is quite handsome, an expert driver and marksman, and popular with all the lady cops. However, as a rich heir, he is quite naive to the ways of the world. His policeman's uniform is an ¬•300,000 yellow pinstripe suit made by Pierre Cardin. Though constantly surrounded by beautiful women throughout his duties, Nakagawa appears indifferent and his tendencies are somewhat ambiguous. He hates natto, and his favorite car is his Ferrari. He has a younger sister who is also as busy as his parents. * Voiced by: Yumi Morio (TV), Mika Doi ('85 Jump Festival Anime), Karina Nose (Live Action TV Series) : Born July 7. A female counterpart to Nakagawa, Reiko's wealth is inherited from European nobility and she juggles her commitments to the police job with those of high society. The daughter of the Kobe-based Akimoto Trading Zaibatsu, Reiko is half French, was raised in France, and is multilingual. With her flowing blonde hair and stunningly cute police uniform she looks like an angel. She is fast for a woman of such built. Reiko is often courted by rich and famous men but has never found the right man. She works in the transportation department and drives a Porsche.

He usually called \\"Buch≈ç\\" or \\"Division Head\\" (ÈÉ®Èï∑) and is Ryotsu's boss. He is a typical grizzled middle-management senior cop. Sporting a small trimmed mustache, akin to Hitler, Bucho is often out of touch or exasperated with his younger staff, but he always ready to punish Ryo-san for his laziness (Despite this, he shows kindness to Ryotsu occasionally, treating him as the son he never had). He is a fatherlike figure for Ryoutsu, Reiko, and Nakagawa. His many hobbies include judo, kendo, sado, bonsai, and calligraphy. He comes to Hashutsujho by bus and train. He is married with one daughter named Hiromi and is grandfather to her two children. * Voiced by: Kaori Asoh : Reiko‚Äôs occasional partner on the force, whose nickname is Maria („Éû„É™„Ç¢) which is an ateji reading of her full name's kanji. She is the most important female character after Reiko in the anime . Like Reiko, Maria is tall, beautiful, and buxom. Unlike Reiko, Maria is a brunette and a transgender woman . Maria along with Reiko are portrayed as being the main beauties of the Kochikame storyline. Ai is in love with Ryotsu due to his resemblance to her former martial arts teacher and becomes jealous whenever another girl comes near him. Initially Ryotsu wanted to marry Maria desperately but started to like her more like a female best friend after knowing her past. Since Maria is no more a man rather a pre-op transwoman , she is occasionally reminded by Ryotsu that she is a man . She was a Muay Thai (kickboxing) champion and generally excels at all martial arts. In the manga, she became a biological female at last after a magical incident, while she remained a transgender in the anime who had undergone hormone replacement therapy and breast augmentation surgery.

A shy young man who still sports a pompadour from his teenage motorcycle gang days, he immediately turns into an aggressive man with a deeper voice and a very intimidating face when he mounts a motorcycle. No motor gangster is a match against him, as he still thinks like one. He is also an otaku who loves sh≈çjo manga and Japanese idols. Honda's father runs a garage specializing in Kawasaki cycles named Honda Ringyo. His humble- aggressive personality switch runs in the family, as his father with his coveralls, his younger brother with bicycles, and his younger sister with elephants. *Voiced by: Chafurin (TV, eps. 1~97), Kobuhei Hayashiya (TV, eps. 98~) : A plump cop stationed at the police box. He wants to live his life as an \\"ordinary policeman\\" but is rather poor and unintelligent, though sensible. He has two sons. Every attempt he makes to buy a house or car ends with tragic results.

He is able to keep his job because his precognition and nensha abilities come in handy during investigations. If he is awakened before the scheduled time, he will go on an angry rampage and cause destruction everywhere, and only the pleading from a beautiful girl can calm him down. * Voiced by: Eiji Takemoto : Ryotsu's fellow patrol officer who often joined him in goofing off during the early years of the series. Though a police officer, he looks more like a yakuza, sporting tattoos on his back and a scar over his right eye. He has been playing mahjong for over 20 years and even remembers playing it as a child. Though once a prominent character, he appears very rarely these days, but he did appear in 2004 and 2006. He has a tattoo on his back. & * Voiced by (Ono): Maya Okamoto (Eps. 2~92), Rieko Miura (Eps. 93~), Kanako Mitsuhashi (Ep. 1) * Voiced by (Naoko): Kanako Mitsuhashi, Maya Okamoto (Ep. 1) : Two female police officers who work on the traffic department. Both of them love to tease and ridicule Ryotsu, though not out of hate. Their relationship with Ryotsu is a love/hate relation, similar to siblings, and both of them know that if they ever get into trouble, they can always count on Ryotsu (even though he sometimes demands a favor in return). Ono is Naoko's senpai. A (behind the scenes) misunderstanding led to them accidentally having each other's voice actress in the first episode. They only appear in the anime series and are absent in the manga. =Other Katsushika Station Officers= * Voiced by: Eimei Esumi‚ÜíEiji Takemoto : Head of the new Katsushika station. A rather kind and gentle man, he met and eloped with his wife during his patrol officer days. He has three children and six grandchildren whom he spends his days off babysitting. His estimated age is 58. * Voiced by: Y≈´ko Doi : A newly arrived traffic division officer who joined the ranks at age 19, right after graduating from high school. She was born in Kanda, Tokyo and is an efficient Edokko. Her shitamachi knowledge is almost on par with Ryo-san. She is a bit of a tomboy and is fearsome in a quarrel. A self-taught martial arts expert, she is also an amazing baseball player, capable of throwing a fastball at 150 km/h (approximately 93 mph). Her family runs the high-class restaurant . She (with her family) is the most important recent addition in the story. : She was engaged to Ryotsu after he started working in Super Kanda Sushi, but it was called off when they realized that they were cousins as well as learning his greedy nature. However, they continued to live and work together and even slept together sometimes (when she was drunk and strangled Ryotsu). In the manga, many chapters prove she and Ryotsu like each other. She usually matches and bests Ryotsu in everything he is good at (except for more negative things like gambling and drinking etc.). Despite her appearance, she is well-versed in many traditional Japanese arts, such as dancing and music, and once dressed up as a geisha - completely fooling both Ryotsu and her brother. Usually her street clothes involve jeans and T-shirts with no makeup and very little accessories. : Works in the traffic division. She is the eldest daughter of a distinguished Bushido house in Kyoto and is well-versed in all such arts. She is attractive and very honest. She is popular with the other policewomen and greatly admires Buch≈ç. Because his voice resembles her father's, she has fallen for Ryotsu and is very jealous of Maria. In addition, her name is a ky≈´d≈ç term. Haya is 21 years old. In later chapters, she displays the ability to see ghosts and even into the future.

He is unaccustomed to women (as he will nosebleed on the sight of them) and surprisingly cowardly without his guns. His ancestors in Ky≈´sh≈´ were ninja. * Voiced by: Masami Iwasaki : A police officer who works at the new Katsushika station. He is excellent at all combat sports, especially, judo. He tries to appear to have no interest in women but spends a lot of money on dating sims and later starts meeting girls online. * Voiced by: Yuu Sugimoto : One of the many young policewomen of the district and Ryotsu's arch-enemy. Saotome thinks Ryotsu is a disgusting, rude, hooligan. Ryotsu thinks Saotome and her colleagues are pampered weaklings and a waste of the force's budget. Saotome and her fellow bachelorettes live in a luxury dormitory resembling a French chateau. * Voiced by: Daisuke Fukagai : An elite police officer and graduate from Tokyo University. He is cool and intelligent but, because his face looks more like that of a yakuza thug, he carries his diploma around as proof that he is as smart as he says he is. His specialty is debate; he still always loses when it comes to looks. * Voiced by: T≈çta Tawaragi The \\"traffic safety\\" instructor for the division. He usually goes way overboard in his training and safety regulation, which basically involve that cars drive slower than walking pace, as well as giving ridiculous nicknames (all associated with traffic regulation) to his colleagues. * Voiced by: Katashi Ishizuka :A frequently appearing cop (though not quite as much in recent years) who laughs at anything and everything. =Other recurring characters= : She works in the Osaka Prefectural Police traffic division. She is unyielding. She is short but is allowed the job because of her ability to make arrests. She has a bronze medal for Olympic shooting. She is 20 years old. She has six younger brothers and her family runs a kushikatsu shop. She views Ryotsu as her \\"Enemy from Tokyo,\\" but she is a fan of Nakagawa and humbles herself in his presence. She only appears in the manga and is absent in the anime. * Voiced by: Rei Sait≈ç : A soldier in the United States Navy and girlfriend of Volvo's. She is a pilot on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson. She is blonde, beautiful and poison in the eyes of Volvo who is weak around women. She is said to be strong enough to defeat 10 Marine Corps soldiers in a row.

She disapproves of Ryo-san and is always trying to keep her granddaughters Matoi and Lemon from falling in love with him, especially Matoi. She is over 100 years old but still perfectly healthy - one of the very few characters who consistently gets the best of Ryo-san. * Voiced by: Ayaka Saito : The younger sister of Matoi. Kindergartener. She is a true child genius who likes historical things such as Mito K≈çmon, shogi, ojarumaru and often speak like an elder person (but has a childish and naive side occasionally as well).

He is a tall, handsome youth who is the main chef at a famous Kyoto restaurant and an almost-professional-level baseball player, as well as a railfan. The main flaw of this seemingly perfect person is that he is rather obsessed with himself and thinks that any beautiful young woman who looks him in the eye is in love with him. He is hard on himself for letting Matoi have a tomboy-like personality (because he started teaching her baseball) and always cries when he starts drinking. =Special Detective Squad= * Voiced by: Ry≈ç Arakawa : Real name .

Main characters ; * :First appearance: One-shot :Age: 16 Height: 179cm/5'10 Birthdate: August 31 :Oga is first introduced as a strong fighter, beating up some classmates and then making them bow down to him because they had attacked him in his sleep, he is the main protagonist of the anime and manga Beelzebub, but occasionally he can be represented as an anti-hero by his violent nature around Ishiyama and even his friends. It is revealed that he is relaying the story of a series of strange events which leads to his becoming the Earthly father of the son of the devil, Beelzebub IV. He was picked to become Beelzebub's father because, in the eyes of Alaindelon (see below), who was carrying the baby, he appeared to possess the qualities of the ideal parent for the future Devil King: strong, arrogant, and thinking nothing of his fellow man. :Oga and Beelzebub (nicknamed baby Beel) cannot be separated by more than 15 meters or else it may result in instant death for Oga, according to Hilda Chapter 2 page 14 (as of chapter 38, the distance has increased by 8 centimetres). A tattoo-like seal on Oga's right hand, which grows larger the more he fights, signifies the contract between Beelzebub and him, whereby Oga can access large amounts of demonic power.Chapter 6 page 9-10 He tries to stop fighting to limit the powers which will ultimately be used to end the human race. However, he is unsuccessful, as his fame of invincibility keeps attracting the attention of other delinquents who seek to conquer him and gain the fame that would come from defeating him. :As the story progresses, the reader learns that Oga is not exactly like the other delinquents in Ishiyama High School. He is certainly a hoodlum, as he relishes the opportunity to fight and seems to take some pride of his reputation of being almost impossible to beat. However, he is not a bully, and does not use his strength to intimidate other people. Also, at first he does not seek fights actively, is not interested in the power struggle that pits Ishiyama's gangs against each other, and does not want to belong to a gang or find underlings of his own. He minds his own business unless provoked, which to his dismay happens all the time. :However, when he learns that the baby will become attached to someone that is both stronger and possessing of the attributes that make the ideal parent, he decides to actively seek confrontation with delinquents who show promise in this regard. This first pits him against the Touhoushinki (see below), but he is disappointed that none of them is able to defeat him. In the process, baby Beel becomes progressively more attached to him and Oga's access to demonic power becomes easier. On defeating Himekawa (see below), he uses for the first time what later becomes his signature attack, the Zebub Blast: a powerful outburst that is strong enough to destroy a building. Later,Chapter 12 he becomes able to draw demonic power even without physical contact with baby Beel, and by chapter 84, he uses it consciously for the first time. :Oga's skill is revealed, in the course of the story, to be the consequence of a strong fighting instinct honed by numerous confrontations with other delinquents from an early age. His fame begins at Kata Middle School,Chapter 57 when it is told that the mean look in his eyes invited attacks from older students, from which he always came out on top, earning him his first nickname, Mad Dog Oga (by Furuichi). At the end of his 7th grade,Chapter 66 he fought alone, and presumably won, against about fifty thugs who had the school under siege. :His exploits at Kata cemented his reputation and at the time of his arrival at Ishiyama as a first-year student, Oga is already known by aliases such as Demon and Raging Ogre, seems to have a lot of enemies from the outset, and makes even more as the series progresses (despite trying not to fight). He also seems to have no friends except for his classmate, Furuichi. He lives with his parents and elder sister (who is an ex-delinquent; it is revealed that she was the first head of the Red Tail gang), though Hilda and Beelzebub have recently moved into his house. :Surprisingly, and often with comical effect, Oga is a decent father figure to Beelzebub. He appears to have his own skewed idea of what a 'man' should be like, and attempts to pass on these ideals to Beel.Chapter 9 Page 8 Despite being called evil by almost every character in the series, he has shown to have a calmer and - if only slightly - warmer side to him, such as when he speaks with Hilda about his position as Beel's parentChapter 38 Page 18 and assuring Lamia that if Beel ever got ill again he would call her immediately.Chapter 47 Page 13 Despite spending much of the first arc trying to pass Beel on to someone stronger and more evil than him, after all the time they spent together they've formed a close bond, and Oga seems to act more friendly towards Beel. :His long fighting record has made him a formidable enemy: although he has no formal training in martial arts, he is quick enough to dodge attacks from skilled fighters like Kunieda or Shinjou Alex; his agility counterbalances Tojo's heavier build and allows Oga to defeat him; and his resilience enables him to resist most direct hits from Miki and largely evade Kunieda's attacks while only sustaining minimal injuries. Oga is possessing of incredible, near superhuman, strength, even if not heavily built: he is able to send people flying in the air with an effortless punch; most of his opponents are knocked out cold with one hit, often being planted headfirst into the ground, ceiling or walls for comic effect; and in chapter 91 he lifted an enormous boulder off the ground. He comes out of most fights unscathed; and the number of opponents, or how they are equipped, seems to be of little concern to him. Due to him defeating the Touhoushinki and his virtual invincibility, he is considered to be \\"The King Of Ishiyama\\", the title given to the school's strongest fighter (Tojo was the \\"King\\" until Oga defeated him). :He is able to hold his own against a demon for some time without resort to demon power Chapter 86 (although he did use the Zebub blast against this enemy, it had no effect). He can feel Saotome (see below) using his demon power, which shows he has notable strength for a human. In chapter 75, the Zebub spell temporarily extends up his arm, over his trunk and across his face, giving him a demonic appearance in the eyes of Kiriya. Later, though, upon having to be rescued from a confrontation with a demon by Saotome, he becomes irritated by the fact he is unable to protect anyone and decides to take formal training from Kunieda's grandfather. After teaching Oga the basics, he engages Saotome to instruct the young man on how to tap Beel's demonic powers to their full extent. In chapter 106, he shows his acquired skills for the first time by defeating a demon with a new movement, the Zebub Emblem: after placing a projection of the Fly King Seal onto the intended target, Oga can launch a barrage of punches that cause an enormous amount of energy to accumulate on the victim, later released as a massive explosion. Oga also becomes capable of dissipating the dark aura of energy that demons release when they prepare an attack. :Also as a consequence of his training, Oga develops an extreme attack, comically dubbed Super Milk Time,Chapter 108 whereby he drinks Baby Beel's milk as a way of increasing their synchronisation ratio, thus enabling Oga to use Beel's power without limit. As a result, he can unleash a frantic, wild attack that can overwhelm even Saotome. As a trade-off, Oga and Beel's mentalities and bodies coalesce and Saotome has warned Oga that allowing himself to run on this state for longer than five minutes may overtax him physical and mentally to the point that he will lose his humanity. He goes on to train under Ikaruga Suiten (see below) in order to keep this process under control.Chapter 130 :As with most thugs in the series, he lacks any particular technique in fighting, mostly relying on his natural prowess to diminish the advantage of trained martial artists like Kunieda and Miki. However, he has figured out some classical techniques from wrestling: he defeats Tojo with a suplex and leads baby Beel in a Clothesline, an Elbow drop and a Boston crab. Later, not wanting to be looked down on by Miki (see below), he starts to invent nonsensical names for his punches and kicks, so that they will sound more respectable like the elaborate movements of trained fighters. However, his immense strength and agility mean that even basic techniques may become quite destructive in his hands. So far, he has learned one specialized movement, Nadeshiko, from Grandpa Kunieda, and in only one day's training became capable of using it to split massive rocks with ease. On his return from training with Suiten, he begins to show superhuman agility and strength similar to Saotome's, and a fine control of Beel's power that allows him to face demons as easily as delinquents.Chapter 131 :Oga is also pretty honourable by delinquents' standards. Although he has no qualms about humiliating petty thugs who pick fights with him, e.g. by making them bow down to him, he respects his opponents of more consequence. In the case of Tojo, for example, after having won the fight against him, Oga is willing to have everyone leave the scene quickly to let Tojo brood over his defeat in peace. He is also quick to acknowledge other people's strength or courage. :Oga's fighting record is not only of clear-cut victories. When caught by surprise or lacking motivation, or unwilling to fight, Oga can be pushed back if the enemy is strong or agile enough, as in his first confrontation with Tojo (who managed to land a punch on him when Oga got distracted by his tattoo) and Aizawa (who attacked from behind). Skilled martial artists like Miki and Kunieda may lack the strength to knock him out, but can come out of a fight against Oga largely unharmed by repeatedly evading or pushing him back. The only humans who have been able thoroughly to defeat Oga are Grandpa Kunieda and Saotome Zenjuurou. :Oga is easily agitated and does not avoid fighting. However, he also seems to care, at least to some degree, about his classmates, as he quickly stopped Nene when she was about to fight Miki, telling her she would lose if she did.Chapter 55 Page 8 Oga, along with Furuichi, is an avid fan of the video game series Dragon Quest, and regularly makes references to the series in the manga. :In a twisted manner, Oga is able to show some affection for his friends. For example, he misses Furuichi during holidays and uses Alaindelon to kidnap him from a five-star resort, if only to annoy him. He also resorts to the extreme measure of badly beating Miki up in order to prevent him from taking part in a fight against Kiriya and his gang (see below). At the end of the manga he is trusted to care for Beel's little sister Nico. ; * :First appearance: One-shot :Known as Beelzebub or . He is the youngest son of the Devil King. He is very attached to Oga, always clinging onto Oga's back or sitting on Oga's head. When he becomes agitated (and initially when he saw blood), he'll often throw a tantrum that will spontaneously electrocute anyone within his vicinity. Without Oga, he is physically weaker than even the average human child,Chapter 11, page 7 but contact with Oga allows him to unleash his demonic powers. After fearing for Oga's safety when he contracted a fever (as his power would end up killing Oga), he severed the contract and ran away. He then became somewhat attached to Tojo, who resembles Oga (at least in his own mind). Later, when Oga and Tojo start to fight, Beel snaps out of his fever and goes back to Oga. At that point, their mutual trust becomes so great that Beel even erases the Zebub spell to allow Oga to fight Tojo without using demonic powers. :Beelzebub's characteristic cry is \\"Daab≈´!\\" and he is always naked with a pacifier in his mouth (in the Animax Asia airing of the anime, he wears a diaper).http://kotaku.com/5932394/when-anime-boobs-and-baby-dingalings-must- be-changed He, like Oga, is shown to anger easily, yet his outbursts are portrayed in a more comical fashion. He, like other demons, is able to sense when a human is particularly strong, and this first leads him to take a liking to Kunieda.Chapters 14 and 53 Later, when she learns how to use demonic powers, Beel becomes even more attached to her.Chapter 113 He has also shown to have some liking to Tojo, who appears to remind him of Oga. When Oga reunites with Miki, Beel showed immediate disgust and possible fear toward the Saint Ishiyama Student.Chapter 54 Page 19 The reason for this has not been stated. :In the demon world, the extent of Beel's true power is finally known when he strikes down a gigantic monster bird in one hit and later defeats a monster larger than a mountain under Oga's direction. :Through the series (so far covering a period of about six months), he shows some development, as expected from an infant, and his ability to interact with other people increases. He and Kunieda's little brother Kouta (see below) develop a rivalry, with comic effect. Beel's power increases as he ages and so does Oga's, but the process is accelerated when both undergo training to allow Oga to control his possession by Beel.Chapter 138 :His name is borrowed from a semitic deity that was incorporated as a demon by Abrahamic religions. ; * :Age: 16 First appearance: One-shot :Preferring to be called by a shorter name, Hilda is a demon maid who helps Oga take care of Beelzebub IV. She reveres the Devil, or Demon Lord, and feels that it is a great honour to be chosen as the child's \\"Mother\\", or caretaker, by the Demon Lord. Her most characteristic features include her Gothic Lolita appearance and (as pointed out by Oga's mother) \\"great big knockers.\\" Hilda is also described as a bombshell, and her right eye is green. The left eye was only revealed in chapter 186, and is normally hidden behind a fringe of hair. That is because it shows moving things at one tenth of their normal speed and captures even minute objects; thus, if both eyes are working together for a long time, Hilda becomes nauseated by the discrepancy between them. :Hilda rides a flying, leathery creature known as an AK-BabaChapter 1, page 37 as transportation and owns an umbrella which conceals a sword in the handle.Chapter 1 page 34 Oga's family is under the impression that Oga and Hilda had sex and that Beelzebub was the result.Chapter 2 After the fight with Tojo, she seems to accept Oga raising Baby Beel and becomes warmer towards him. :Despite being blunt and cold most of the time, she has been shown to have a kinder side that comes out from time to time, often at the surprise and/or disbelief of the other characters.Chapter 50 Page 6 Being a demon herself, she is quite knowledgeable about the demon world, being able to successfully navigate Oga and company through Vlad's Haunt. She takes being Beel's mother quite seriously and even goes as far as to state that it was the only reason for her existence. As a fighter she is quite skilled. Her skills gained her the nickname \\"Oga Bride\\" at Ishiyama, as she dispatches her enemies in a similar manner to Oga (e.g., shoving her opponents' heads into walls). In the anime, she has developed an interest in watching soap opera, much to Oga's disbelief. Her name comes from the Old High German name \\"Hildegard\\" meaning Hild (=war or battle) and Gard (=protection) and means \\"protecting battle-maid\\". :Hilda and Oga's rapport is pragmatic for the most part. Hilda often looks down on him and never hesitates to mock him, but at the same time acknowledges his strength and allies with him in Beel's interest. In turn, he finds her cold and manipulative personality annoying, but does follow her advice. However, it is shown on rare occasions that they do care about each other and work extremely well together in a fight. :Initially in the manga, Hilda was probably the most powerful of the series' protagonists, as she was able to, for a short time, fight with Saotome while Oga, Tojou, and Izuma were taken out instantly by the teacher. When she becomes serious in a fight, she becomes surrounded by a pure black aura, which she then channels into her sword for a powerful attack. It is implied that, as with Beel, her full-fledged powers are much greater than what she is able to show in the human world, but she would need a human contractor to access them. She is considered to be the very elite among demon wet nurses, and is able to defeat Lord En's three maids single-handedly (see below). More recently, though,Chapter 106 Oga may have surpassed her by learning to use Beel's powers. Kunieda (see below) may also have become a match for Hilda after seemingly having trained to improve her sword skill and procuring help from Koma and Ikaruga Nazuna (see below). Just recently her age was revealed to be 16.Chapter 115 ; * :First appearance: One-shot :Age:: 16 Height: 175cm/5'9 Birthdate: November 11 :Another first year at Ishiyama, Furuichi seems to be the only non-delinquent student there and has little, if any, fighting ability. He often points out the absurdities in Oga's situation, acting as the rational and most passive member of the group. Furuichi often complains about Oga, stating that just because he hangs around with him, people take him for a delinquent as well.Chapter 52 Page 4 He is the eldest child of his family, which seems to be wealthier than Oga's, since they are able to spend summer holidays in a five-star resort. He is also implied to be quite a good student, and Miki says that his grades would have easily earned him a place in Saint Ishiyama School. He is a prototypical lovelorn teenager and is always scheming to ingratiate himself with the fair sex, to little avail: most women - human and demon alike - around are stronger than he, and many moments of comic relief in the series arise when Furuichi has his advances on girls frustrated. He envies Oga for being the object of Kunieda's love and for having Hilda under the same roof (see below). :He is very conscious of his own weakness and will not stand up to thugs, although he is quick to do an about-face when a pretty girl is involved. At these junctures, he shows considerable strategy and is even ruthless, for example using baby Beel to electrocute several enemies in a pool,Chapter 22 suggesting a different but no less evil commonality with Oga. :Furuichi and Oga seem to be reciprocal only friends, and the former is often the one that Oga goes to for conversation. He is comically referred to as \\"idiot Furuichi\\" by Oga, and is often the victim of many jokes in the story, although he is shown to have a darker side to him as well: Furuichi is not above returning to Oga some of the distress he is involved in because of him, and does not mind having Oga electrocuted as collateral damage in the episode described above. Their mutual loyalty is very fierce: Oga becomes riled up when Himekawa kidnaps and manhandles his friend, and Furuichi does not refrain from standing on Oga's side in tight spots, and even to put himself in danger to help him. Furuichi quickly (if reluctantly) forgives him for kidnapping him from his holiday resort.Chapter 21 Page 9 Like Oga, he is a fan of Dragon Quest. He has a younger sister, Honoka. :The story of how such disparate characters got along is eventually told. It turns out that Oga sees Furuichi as being very strong, but in a different way: in order to earn Oga's trust when they were ten years old, Furuichi resisted Oga's strikes multiple times, always getting back on his feet, something that had never happened before.Chapter 175 This and Furuichi disregard for the danger around Oga's fights have cemented their friendship, and Oga holds Furuichi's judgement in high regard. :In chapter 174, Behemoth (see below) wonders about Furuichi's ability to channel demonic power, despite the fact that Furuichi seems to be only a normal human. ; * :First appearance: One-shot :A dimensional transfer demon working under Hildegarde, he is first seen floating down the river with an arrow on his chest. He sees Oga forcing other delinquents to kneel before him and decides to deliver baby Beel to him as a potential parent. He is heavily built and is most often seen wearing a tank-top and boxer-shorts. After Oga becomes Beel's parent he moves in with Furuichi, against the boy's wishes. It is revealed in Chapter 42 that he has a daughter,Chapter 49 Page 19 but in the course of the story he also displays homosexual affection for Furuichi, much to the latter's chagrin. These tendencies are exaggerated in the anime. :He is supposed to be a satirical representation of the singer Freddie Mercury and is named after French actor Alain Delon; his appearances are often used for comic effect. Despite that, he is considered highly competent by Hilda, both as an assistant and a transdimensional demon: he is one of few who are capable of transporting two people at once and is able to recover from injuries in little time; his power is such that he can use a communicator as a homing device and send a person to the corresponding location. Alaindelon often advises Hilda about Oga and Beel. Both demons later join St. Ishiyama disguised as students in order to try to identify demons hiding in the school (see below). Ishiyama High Ishiyama is described as \\"the hoodlum school\\": with the exception of Furuichi, all students are delinquents who spend most of the time fighting. It is accidentally destroyed by Oga on chapter 37. =T≈çh≈çshinki= The four leaders of the delinquent forces in Ishiyama High. T≈çh≈çshinki is an acronym of their respective last names, , , , and . In the English subtitled version of the anime by Crunchyroll, the abbreviation TKKH (using the first letters of their surnames) is used. While initially introduced as antagonists early in the series, the four later become Oga's most loyal followers, each gaining the King's Emblem (located on different parts of their body) that allows them to tap into Beelzebub's demon powers during fights to a level that allows them to go toe-to-toe with other demon contract holders. ; : :First appearance: chapter 3 :Age: 18 Height: 178cm/5'10 Birthdate: June 1 :The first of the four to be introduced, he was the closest to dominating the school at the time. A sadistic and malignant third year, he was sought out by Oga to be a replacement father for Beel, Oga hoping Kanzaki's purportedly sinister and malicious character would be more appealing to the demon baby than his own. However, after Kanzaki viciously humiliates Shiroyama, his most loyal underling and until then his right-hand man, Oga becomes enraged and punches Kanzaki through a top-story window, sending him to the hospital and further solidifying Beel's attachment to him. After that, Kanzaki loses his retinue, save for Shiroyama and Natsume (see below). He later consorted with Himekawa and Oga in order to pull down the powerful Tojo, but gets caught up with Himekawa in a fight against Tojo's underlings and is sent to the hospital again due to injuries contracted in the explosion that destroyed the school. :Later he begins to reciprocate the loyalty of his remaining subordinates - now better described as friends -, such as when he goes to get revenge for Shiroyama after he is beaten up by St. Ishiyama High students, and his character evolves in a more likable fashion. At St. Ishiyama, he seeks to preserve the reputation of the Ishiyama students against the advances of the six Horsemen (see below), and starts to show some loyalty to Oga and the others. His considerable and unwarranted pride is often depicted in comical fashion, such as when he intervenes to relieve Tojo, who is much stronger than he is, in a fight against a demon. :His fighting style is raw and brutal, and does not appear to have any technique, but is effective against the average thug. Even after being defeated by Oga, his reputation as a T≈çh≈çshinki persists and he is greatly feared by lesser delinquents. It is implied that his family is wealthy and/or influential, and that he pushed that influence to achieve his status as a gang leader. On chapter 143, the reader learns that Kanzaki is indeed the second son of a yakuza family and has a little niece from his brother. :He wears a small chain hanging from his left ear and from a piercing below his mouth. It is revealed that Kanzaki becomes enraged if someone pulls the chain and in these occasions he becomes three times stronger than normal.Chapter 112 Nevertheless, after being defeated by Oga, he was gradually displaced in the scale of strength, to the point of being harshly beaten by the Poltergeists in chapter 193 (see below). However, he was then branded with a secondary Zebub Spell, effectively becoming Beel's first human knight, and proceeded to defeat all of his opponents single-handedly. ;; :: :First appearance: chapter 3 :Kanzaki's most devoted underling. A strong, tall third-year, he is nevertheless easily defeated by Oga with a single shot to the chin. Even after his humiliation by Kanzaki and the dissolution of the latter's gang, he remains attached to Kanzaki. Later, when he is sent to the hospital by St. Ishiyama students, Kanzaki visits upon him. He escapes the hospital to support Ishiyama against the Horsemen in the volleyball match, but is taken back by the staff. He is often seen acting as Kanzaki's voice of reason. ;; :: :First appearance: chapter 3 :A soft-spoken, third-year student and an underling of Kanzaki, he shows exceptional interest in Oga and his exploits. Handsome and long-haired, he prefers to make lighthearted quips during frays to engaging in them personally. Though he rarely participates in fights himself, he is incredibly strong, taking out the MK5 by himself and even downing one of Tojo's underlings within seconds. From this it is implied that Natsume is significantly stronger than previously credited, as not even Kanzaki or Himekawa were capable of such a feat. He shows these fighting skills again when he blocks Gou Hiromichi from attacking Oga head on, later stating during their fight, \\"it's not really my style to go all out in a fight.\\" ; : :First appearance: chapter 6 :He is the son of the \\"Himekawa Group\\", a financial zaibatsu, a third-year student and the second member of the Tohoshinki. Using money to solve his problems, he bribes friends and enemies into his employment, often turning the tables on dissident challengers by co-opting their own friends against them. This tactic proved completely useless on Oga, and Himekawa was the first victim of the Zebub Blast.Chapter 8-9 Following his recovery, he groups himself together with Oga and Kanzaki in order to remove Tojo from power, but is caught up in the explosion with Kanzaki and most of the student body. He has a slightly outlandish appearance, including his hair in Pompadour hairstyle and his constant use of sunglasses, most often complete with a Hawaii shirt. For comedic effect, he is shown to be quite handsome without his glasses and with his hair brushed down, which makes him look like a completely different person. :Although a capable fighter, Himekawa uses underhanded tactics to prevail, such as having his opponents break their fists by punching a ceramic tile shield hidden under his shirt, or electrocuting them with a shock-baton (both are shown to be useless against Oga). In his first appearance, he resorted to outright criminal acts to lure Oga, such as kidnapping Furuichi and threatening to kill him and Hilda. He behaved quite viciously towards her, shooting her garments multiple times with a water gun filled with acid in search of a mobile phone. :After losing his gang and later at St. Ishiyama, his character also evolves in a more positive fashion. Like Kanzaki, he starts to show some loyalty to his colleagues, especially to Oga, even stopping an attack by Sakaki Mitsuteru against an unarmed Kunieda. His strategic skills prove useful when he clinches a deal with St. Ishiyama's teachers to prevent his and his colleagues' expulsion. He is also the source of outside information regarding other gangs and always seems to be in the knowing of what is going on outside the classroom. It is revealed in chapter 135 that he has abnormal puzzle-solving skills. :Even for the standards of upper class families, Himekawa is granted extravagant means by his family: his pocket money, for example is enough to acquire the proprietor rights over an Internet game. He used to live in a multiple-story elite condominium penthouse he purchased with his and his friend Kugayama's (see below) winnings in Internet wager games, but it got destroyed by Oga. :In contrast to the other Touhoushinki, none of his underlings can be called his friend, and he was left completely alone after his defeat at Oga's hands. However, he garnered some respect from the others after helping out in the search for Lord En (see below). Aside from that, he is sometimes seen with a young butler called Hasui,Chapter 168 page 13 who is the only person who calls him by his given name. He is revealed to be the fourth person with a Zebub Symbol, only he is actually the 3rd Knight. ; * :First appearance: chapter 10 :Age: 17 Height: 165cm/5'5 Birthdate: May 15 :Aoi is 17 years old, a second- year student and the third leader of the \\"strongest ladies of Kantou\\", the Red Tails.Chapter 11 page 18-19 She is first introduced in disguise at the park taking care of her baby brother, Kouta,Chapter 10 page 19 who is constantly mistaken as being Aoi's own child by the mothers at the park. She is the daughter of a local shrine keeper.Chapter 10 page 18 Her nickname is Queen because she is the protector of all the girls at Ishiyama High from the men's \\"grubby hands\\".Chapter 13, page 12 Because of Oga's dense personality, he has yet to realize that the girl he befriended at the park that Oga knows as \\"Aoi Kunie\\" and Kunieda are one and the same. Despite her tough personality, she has a rather girlish crush on Oga but refuses to admit this fact to others. She can feel Saotome using his demon power, which shows she has notable strength for a human. :Aoi differs from the other thugs at Ishiyama in that she has formal martial arts training from her grandfather, the master of the shingetsu style. She is also not a bully, and steers the leadership of the Red Tails towards preventing unnecessary fights in the school. This is what puts her first in collision course with Oga, as the latter is deemed by her to be responsible for most of recent violent events in the school. They have two exchanges: in neither does Oga return her attacks, limiting himself to evade them, first to let baby Beel assess her strength and thus find out whether she is a potential replacement for him; later, because a failure in communication leads Oga to believe that Aoi's condition to take Beel is that he should resist her charges. She is greatly impressed by Oga's speed and power, and misunderstands his advances on her (to get rid of Beel) as romantic interest. After he saves her from a plot by the MK5, she decides to leave the Red Tails and become a more disciplined person, and at the same time her crush on Oga increases. Later, she and the Red Tails intervene to stop the whole male student body of Ishiyama from attacking Oga, allowing him to proceed to a confrontation with Tojo unhindered. :She at first harboured some jealousy against Hilda, seeing her as a potential rival for Oga, but on discovering the truth about her and Baby Beel's true nature, their animosity becomes less pronounced. Later, it is Hilda who becomes jealous of Beel's attachment to Aoi. :She is a skilled swordswoman and martial artist, and possesses an immense amount of vitality and stamina, as well as impressive speed that is above Sakaki Mitsuteru's, who is known to be able to wield his sword at 250 km/h (however, she is not fast enough to hit Oga, who manages to evade even her best attacks with minor injuries). She can use any weapon she chooses in battle, and has even been shown to fight with nothing more than a ruler. She has shown the ability to assess opponents' strengths and weaknesses very quickly. Despite all this however, Hilda has noted that Aoi is still below Oga's level in terms of battle capabilities. :After being targeted by demons, she and Oga went on a training trip with her grandfather to improve their fighting skills. She then requested for advice on how to exorcise demons from her friend Isafuyu (see below). After training, she and Hilda fight again, and this time Kunieda proves to be a match for the demon maid. Hilda then notices that Kunieda has somehow learned to use demonic powers herself. It is later explained that Kunieda forged an alliance with a minor deity, Koma (see below), and becomes able to release demonic power, as sensed by Beel and Hilda. She become's the second of Beel's Knights, gaining her Zebub Symbol on her chest during her fight with Ringo. ;; * ::First appearance: chapter 12 ::Age: 15 Height: 154cm/5'0 Birthdate: November 7 ::A first-year and leading member of the Red Tails. Chiaki rarely speaks and dispatches her enemies swiftly with a pair of modified air-guns hidden under her skirt (actually, she can use up to four guns at the same time). She is very loyal to Kunieda even after she leaves the gang, and is ready to shoot anyone other than Oga who makes advances on her. She is the first to recognise that Kunieda is in love with Oga and thinks it very cute, as opposed to Nene (see next). She is an expert video game player, often playing with her little brother, and Kanzaki gives her the nickname \\"Akichi\\" (an inversion of the syllables of her name) to signify her gaming persona. ;; * ::First appearance: chapter 12 ::Age: 16 Height: 162 cm/5'4 Birthdate: January 14 ::Originally Kunieda Aoi's second- in-command, Nene is far more aggressive than her permissive leader. Though she often openly disagrees with and occasionally disobeys Kunieda, she is still her faithful wingman, balking vociferously when Kunieda opts to leave the Red Tails and relinquish the mantle of leadership to her. She takes it nevertheless and soon proves to be worthy of it, gaining the confidence and trust of the Red Tails as their fourth leader. Her weapon of preference are chains, which she uses proficiently to gain an advantage against stronger men. As Kunieda, she is a second-year student. ;; * ::First appearance: chapter 34 ::A first-year student and a talkative member of the Red Tails who often makes embarrassing statements. She has long hair that is always adorned with a flower-shaped hairpin that can be used as a dagger. As a member of the Red Tails, she is a very good fighter and is not afraid of facing men. Lately, she and Kanzaki have been getting along, beginning when both witnessed Tojo's fight with a demon. In some recent chapters, it is lightly implied that she might have feelings for Kanzaki. ; : :First appearance: chapter 15 :The fourth, and by far the strongest, T≈çh≈çshinki (his strength in comparison to Kunieda is not confirmed, though it can be implied that he is stronger than she indirectly thought from their other fights). He is introduced how a main antagonist in the anime and a third-year student, Tojo has an unexpected soft side towards smaller creatures and babies, though said creatures do not feel similarly towards him. He is mostly bored with weaklings and is always looking for a good fight, which subsequently leads to his interest towards Oga. He works multiple jobs and sometimes has to miss school because of them. He can feel Saotome using his demon power, which shows he has notable strength for a human. His fighting style is a rigid brutal force. He appears to possess an incredible amount of stamina, as he was able to take a full blow from Miki without so much as flinching. Tojo presents an immediate threat to anyone he faces and has shown a strong willingness to fight, even at the expense of his own body. He is also called by the nickname Tora by his friends. :His main adversary thus far has been Oga, and although he does show a certain amount of respect for him, it is clear that the battles they share are the only things that matter to him. Tojo is stronger and more resilient, but Oga is more agile and has a superior technique. They have had three skirmishes so far: in the first one, Oga was gaining the upper hand but got distracted by Tojo's tattoo and was sent flying (although the punch failed to knock him out - the first time someone resisted a punch by Tojo). In the second, Oga defeated him fair and square, if narrowly, after a protracted fight. Contrarily to Himekawa and Kanzaki, Tojo is very honourable and promptly acknowledges his defeat. Later his fighting skill increased and when they have a third, amicable fight, it ended in a draw. :He appears to know Nanami Shizuka, the female member of the Horsemen, quite well. She referred to him as Tora when they met after the volleyball match, and both went searching for Saotome afterwards. :He looks up to Saotome Zenjuurou (see below), and has copied the latter's royal seal in the form of a tattoo in order to resemble him. Contrarily to Oga, he actively seeks to fight against progressively stronger opponents, and has his eyes currently on Izuma (see below) and demons. However, he is not a bully and shows no real interest in attracting followers as Himekawa and Kanzaki. He tends to be more aloof in class, although he does show loyalty towards his colleagues. He and Oga are the only humans so far to have been able temporarily to hold their ground against demons without resort to demonic powers of their own. :After being nearly killed by a demon, Tojo receives basic instructions from Saotome on how to tackle this kind of adversary, and the teacher states that he is safe to improve his skill if left to his own devices, as Tojo's fighting is mostly driven by instinct. When he appears again, he begins to show superhuman strength and speed on par with Oga's, but the origin of those hasn't been explained. He is the third person revealed to be one of Beel's Knights, with his symbol appearing on his upper arm. His number, however, is 4. ;;Kaoru Jinno :: :First appearance: chapter 15 :A long- haired, third-year underling of Tojo's. He has a calm attitude and is shown to be bookish, but is nevertheless a strong fighter, being able to defeat Himekawa and Kanzaki on his own easily. ;;Shoji Aizawa :: :First appearance: chapter 15 :Tojo's right-hand man and a third-year student. He wears sunglasses and has a cool attitude, and is a strong fighter. He has been able to evade one of Oga's attacks and even fight him briefly, although Oga had been taken by surprise. He and Kaoru are caught in the destruction of Ishiyama High and later share a hospital room with Kanzaki, Shiroyama and Himekawa. =Six Killer Elements= :Also known as \\"Ishiyama's Six Upstarts\\", they are six first-years who make their appearance at Ishiyama when it is finally rebuilt. Each one leads their own gang. During the period when the students were scattered among different schools, they seem to have grown strong and confident enough to challenge Oga and the T≈çh≈çshinki for the leadership of the school. They are divided in two tiers: the Three Kings and, above them, the Three Beasts. The Three Kings ;;Kankur≈ç Akahoshi ::First appearance: chapter 190 :The former leader of Hiaburi High School, his battle name is \\"Fan that dyes everything blood red\\", and his coat has the picture of a fan on its backside. Other than the hairstyle, he resembles Oga quite closely in physical appearance. Despite being the lowest-ranked of the Elements, he is quite proud and confident, and has declared that he will beat Oga fair and square to take his place as king of the school. His number two is Ryou Haizawa, a third year; and his number three is Shigeru Shigemori, a second-year. He is the contractor of one of the Seven Sins, Mammon ;;Houjou Ringo ::First appearance: chapter 190 :The only woman in the group. She was a former Red Tail under Aoi's leadership, but now has formed her own group at Majougari Academy, calling themselves the New World Red Tails. Her class and year are still unclear: she is described as a first year, but also as the second leader of the Red Tails before Kunieda. In their first clash with Aoi, the latter refused to fight back against former comrades and suffered minor injuries. Houjou is nicknamed \\"Tabako\\", since she is often smoking. Her numbers two and three are third- years Maaya Ajari and Yukino Kagemiya, respectively. ;;Ebian Ichikawa ::First appearance: chapter 190 :Formerly the head of Sabatou High, and known as \\"Blind Swordsman\\" due to a scar that keeps his left eye permanently shut, he is a bulky, bald man who is constantly scowling and who sports a moustache. He wears a dark suit with a scarf and carries a flower on his mouth, resulting in a slightly outlandish appearance. He is described as temperamental and describes Beel as \\"cute\\" on first seeing him. His weapon of choice is a sword and, like Aoi, he can cut through concrete with it. His numbers two and three are third-years Souken Chabou and Tetsuhito Kajiura, respectively. Three Beasts ;;Y≈çhei Nasu ::First appearance: chapter 188 :The former head of Sourei High and nicknamed as \\"Aubergine\\" (the meaning of the kanji that form his name), \\"Nasubi\\" is a tall, blond man of dishevelled appearance and who behaves condescendingly against opponents, even calling Oga \\"Lil' Oga\\". He is strong enough not only to take Oga's wall-burying punch but to easily detach himself from the wall, breaking it in the process. He and his gang members formed a musical group called The Poltergeists: Masao Onizuka, a tall third- year who used to fight Toujou and be the \\"ki\\" in the T≈çh≈çshinki before Himekawa, is the pianist; Teruomi Hino, a second-year who wears a mask, is the trumpeter; Seiji Kamayama, a dark-haired second-year, is the bassist; and Taiz≈ç Shiori, an obese third-year, is the drummer. :On their first encounter, Nasu tells Oga he is going to steal Beel from him, and indeed seems to be very interested in the baby. It is eventually revealed that Nasu, like Saotome (see below) is a Spellmaster, and quite an advanced one at that. He is defeated by Oga and Beel, while his henchmen are beaten by Kanzaki. He is part of a larger conspiracy which seems to be targeting Baby Beel. He is the third Beast. ;;Shinobu Takamiya ::First appearance: chapter 188 :The former leader of Daten High and the second Beast, he is the contractor of Lucifer. He led a gang called Fallen Angels. ;;Fuji :He is the contractor of one of the Seven Sins, Satan. =Others= ;MK5 First appearance: chapter 15 Named \\"Majide Kuukiyomenai 5 ningumi\\" [translation: The Unbelievably Tactless 5], this gang was suspended from school and is famous for its immense cruelty and poor hygiene. They always sport neckties and make a point of appearing in choreographic fashion, often with comical effects. Despite this, they are relatively weak in comparison to most of the other characters and have yet to win a single fight; they are almost always quickly defeated in an instant. They are distinct from most other thugs in that they use firearms loaded with actual bullets, and have even gone so far as to try to eliminate Nene Oomori. Members consist of: :: Short, snarky, and black-haired. The acting leader. :: Marked by a heart-shaped tattoo on his face. Uses a pistol. :: Bald and scarred. Uses nunchuks. :: Chapeaued and bespectacled. Carries a rifle. :: Immense, muscular, and has long hair. ; : :First appearance: chapter 2 :Better known as \\"Good Night Shimokawa\\", he is a second-year thug who has a crush on Kunieda and is one of the first to be defeated by Oga. His nickname derives from his constant use of \\"Good night\\" to address people. Saint Ishiyama Academy Oga and his friends were transferred to Saint Ishiyama Academy, the sister school of Ishiyama High, when the latter was destroyed. They are not welcome however, as the school is unwilling to adopt the delinquents. The group is constantly harassed by the students of the school, but they are not the only problem. The school of Saint Ishiyama Academy has a force within it that upholds the rules of conduct. They are known as the (or horsemen). They are six captains of different sports teams and groups/clubs who possess an extraordinary amount of strength and fighting experience. They have set out to get rid of Oga and his friends, and are backed by an unfair rule that allows them to carry out \\"judgement\\" on any person or party within the student body. The six knights challenged Oga and his friends to a sports competition (after a huge fight on the rooftops of Saint Ishiyama). The wager of the battle was clear: if Oga and his friends won, they would not be expelled. Himekawa also managed to clinch a deal with the teacher in charge of student life, whereby if the six knights lost the competition they would be stripped of their authority and privileges. In the end, Ishiyama came out on top. =Six Holy Knights= ; : :First appearance: chapter 50 :The only first-year student of Saint Ishiyama to become a member of the Six Knights. He is the captain of the Karate team and a master of Hakkyokuken, as well as an advanced practitioner of the fictional Izuma-style martial arts. He is very strong, being able to take down Kanzaki with a single punch. Miki knows Oga from middle school, where Oga (intentionally or not) saved Miki from a group of high school delinquents. Wanting to become stronger, he started to hang around Oga, but later realized that this would not make him any stronger, because no matter what kind of fight he was dragged into, Oga Tatsumi took care of everything.Chapter 57 Page 15 However, when they meet again at St. Ishiyama, he appears to hold deep feelings of contempt towards Oga and to be obsessed with proving to his former classmate how strong he has become. :The origin of Miki's grudge against Oga is later told. Miki used to hang out with Oga and Furuichi and longed to be accepted as a friend by them. One night, Miki found himself in a tight spot when he tried to recover a charm given to him by his father from a group of middle school thugs led by Kiriya Reiji, who gave him his double scar in the left cheek. At the occasion, Oga helped Miki out and used Kiriya's own nails to carve a triple scar across his face. Later, Miki found that Oga, without telling him, was being constantly harassed by Kiriya and his underlings who wanted revenge. Miki went after Oga to offer to fight along him, but Oga shunned him coldly, purporting not even to know his friend. Still, Miki thought Oga just wanted to keep him from harm, especially as Miki was about to move to Nara with his mother. One afternoon, however, when Kiriya's gang surrounded Kata Middle School after Oga, Miki decided to join him. At this point, Oga lashed out, viciously beating and humiliating him in front of everybody. Miki then became severely resentful of Oga and decided to become better than he at fighting, in order eventually to beat him. :However, when Kiriya holds St. Ishiyama hostage three years later to get his own revenge against Oga, he casually reveals to Miki that he moved with his family to Nara at the same time as Miki, who finally realises the truth: Oga was aware that Kiriya and Miki would live in the same area and that, if Miki, who had no fighting skill at the time, had taken part in the fight against Kiriya, the latter would have retaliated against him in a treacherous manner later. Therefore, Oga decided to sever ties with Miki, and even to beat him up in front of Kiriya, in order to shift attention off him. In this he succeeded: Kiriya did not go after Miki while both were living at Nara and actually did not remember him at all when they met again. :When Miki realises this, all animosity against Oga vanishes and the two fight back to back against Kiriya. From that point on, Oga, who had refrained to acknowledge their former acquaintance, begins to use Miki's name, and the latter begins to try to get close to his former friend again. :Miki's fighting record is mixed. Having been thoroughly trained in martial arts, he relies on his agility to evade Oga's attacks, and is one of very few people to come out of a fight with him unscathed. However, most of his own attacks, although strong enough to take down Kanzaki, fail to have much of an effect on stronger thugs like Oga and Tojo. The Izuma style finisher (the Black Owl Killer) is strong enough to take down Oga in one hit, but it must be stressed that Oga actually intended to take the blow to measure Miki's strength, and made no effort to dodge or counter it.Chapter 67 In Miki's own estimation, in that occasion he couldn't claim to have beaten Oga, mainly because executing the Black Owl Killer on him before having perfected the move damaged his hands badly to the point of bleeding. It is worth noting that Oga, though certainly incapable of retaliating, was not knocked out and was able to stand up on his feet soon afterwards, even though the move was supposed to send the victim to the hospital. Miki's own resilience does not seem particularly high, as he was quite affected by two hits from Teimou's shadow forces (see below), and was saved from further injury by Oga. By that point, though, he had perfected the Black Owl Killer and performed it to devastating effect on Kosei Kuroki (see below). :Despite being one of the six people who can feel Saotome using his powers, and therefore possessing of notable strength for a human, it is unclear whether Miki knows of the demon world, as he has not had any contact with demons. However, it is later learned that he is training with Izuma in preparation for a confrontation with the 34th Pillar Squad.Chapter 121 ; : :First appearance: chapter 59 :The leader of the six knights, Miki's teacher, the master of the Izuma dojo and until recently the student council president. A third-year, he is shown to be the strongest of its members, holding a great deal of authority over the group. Izuma is the descendant of a demon who escaped to the human world and he was taken up by Saint Ishiyama's headmaster upon losing his place in society for showing his powers in a previous school. As such, he can also release the dark aura seen in full demons, though apparently in lower levels. :He is often shown to oscillate between a calm and controlled attitude and a positive thirst for death. He has shown considerable authority, not only among students, but with the faculty members other than the headmaster as well, and is behind the initiative to challenge Ishiyama students for a volleyball match. During the match, he uses his martial style technique to send killer serves, but is eventually defeated by Kunieda. When Oga uses the Zebub Blast against Kiriya, he recognises the use of demonic powers and arranges a quick cover-up to prevent Oga from being exposed. In a later conversation, the headmaster reveals to him that Oga may be a target to demons, but it is not known whether he knows about baby Beel's being the Demon Lord's son. He can feel Saotome using his demon power, which shows he has notable strength for a human. In chapter 178, it is implied that he has feelings for Shizuka. :Izuma's fighting ability is superior to that of the other Knights and on par with Tojo's and Oga's. However, contrarily to them, he is taken down with ease by a demon and is saved from certain death by Tojo's intervention. Afterwards, he also set out to train in order to become capable of facing this kind of enemy.Chapter 114 Page 10 ; : :First appearance: chapter 50 :His heritage is still unknown but it is clear that he has some Spanish heritage. He is a second-year at Saint Ishiyama High with light wavy hair. The captain of the boxing club, he is regarded as the second best high school boxer in the nation and is known to finish all matches with a one-hit knockout of the opponent. He also plays the piano.Chapter 68, page 19 As of chapter 177, he has replaced Kaname Izuma as student council president. :At first, he shows contempt for Ishiyama's students and seeks a confrontation with Oga in the first opportunity. At the point, Oga's thoughts are of forcing baby Beel on him; knowing that fighting back means expulsion, he decides to take Alex' punches at first, while testing him with trivia questions in order to show baby Beel that he is not only strong but clever, with comic effect. :Alex is strong enough to defeat the MK5 with ease. However, he is no match for Oga: his punches fail to knock him out at first; later, Oga easily evades them and even stops one with his hand. When he finally evokes a reaction from Oga, the latter deals him a defeat similar to the ones Alex is known to deal to others: a one-hit knockout. ; : :First appearance: chapter 51 :Sakaki is a second-year like Shinjou. He has long black hair that is usually kept in a ponytail. He is usually seen in his standard Ishiyama uniform and is the least talkative of the knights. He is the captain of the kendo team. :Sakaki is a very skilled swordsman and is able to cut a few hairs of Kunieda's with a wooden sword. However, he is not in her league: Kunieda is able to cut his sword with a ruler, to Sakaki's shock. He then begins to believe her the strongest of the Ishiyama students and longs to have a rematch with her. He even goes to the length of attacking her when she is unarmed and unwilling to fight back, but is stopped by Himekawa. The two men then fight and seem reasonably well matched, with Himekawa coming out in a slightly worse condition. :Later, Sakaki begins to show some attraction to Kunieda, and her toughness leads him to consider her a tsundere character. ; : :First appearance: chapter 55 :Go is a muscular third-year. He is the captain of the radio club and participates in international ARDF competitions. He is ruthless and actively seeks fights, and attacked out of impulse once Miki admitted that Oga was the strongest of the four who showed up for the rooftop fights. His advance was intercepted by Shintarou Natsume and the two had a reasonably matched fight. ; : :First appearance: chapter 59 :She is an attractive, red- haired third-year, the only female member of the six knights, the captain of the archery team and until recently the student council vice-president. She seems to have a strong relationship with Izuma as she is able to joke and laugh with him, something the other horsemen seem unable to do (likely due to their fear of him). She is seen massaging Izuma's back after their volleyball training session.Chapter 65 Page 15 She knows Tojo from the past and calls him Tora, and both are longing to meet Saotome Zenjuurou. Her actual fighting skill is yet undetermined, but Kunieda was surprised that she could reach the rooftop undetected by her, and both girls rose up to help Oga and Miki against Teimou, which indicates Shizuka is as unafraid of physical combat against men as Kunieda. She can feel Saotome using his demonic powers, which shows she has notable strength for a human. Shizuka has three siblings, two boys and a girl, the eldest of whom seems to look up to Tojo. It is heavily implied that she has feelings for him, but is content for now with being his friend.Chapter 158 =Others= ; : :First appearance: chapter 48 :A first year student who looks up to thugs and gangs and wants to become a delinquent himself. He deeply admires Oga as the best hoodlum around and their first contact is when Oga and Kunieda save him and his friend Azusa from harassment by Teimou students. He then kowtows to Oga and begs to become his underling. After some insistence and flattery, Oga ends up accepting his company. He also admires Furuichi, to the latter's delight, calling him \\"General Furuichi\\", for being the only man able to follow Oga. His plot role so far has been mostly comic relief and as an information source on the Six Knights. ; : :First appearance: chapter 49 :Yamamura's girlfriend and classmate and an easy-going, lighthearted girl who quickly gets on good terms with Kunieda and Oga, even rooting for them in their fight against the Six Knights. ; : :First appearance: chapter 77 :A spellmaster, a human who made a contract with a demon and becomes capable of using their powers, who is assigned to Oga's class. The difference between simple contractors and spellmasters is not clear and may be just a matter of experience. It is not known which demon made the contract, but it is implied to be a member of the royal family, as Hilda recognises the seal on his hand. He already had sealed the contract when he was in High School.Chapter 127 He wears a bandana, long, black dishevelled hair and is always seen smoking. He is also quite perverted, shamelessly flirting with Kunieda and her subordinates, peeking up Hilda's skirt and also groping her breasts during their fight. :Saotome is the most powerful human described so far, although Oga may have matched him recently. He shows superhuman strength, speed and agility and is able to defeat several uncontracted demons with relative ease, including Hilda. He can use the Nadeshiko movement as Oga, but in a much larger scale, even splitting hillocks with it. It is implied that he has access to information from the demon world that even Hilda is not privy to. His control of his demonic powers was initially much greater than Oga's, and he can gauge the amount of energy he wants to use with precision, as seen by the fine control he has over the size and expansion of his own tattoo. Recently, he offered to teach Tojo how to fight a demon. It seems that he is acting on Genma Isurugi's orders: in the school, he is appointed as homeroom teacher to the Ishiyama students. After overcoming some resistance from Oga, Saotome teaches him how to use Beel's powers to fight other demons. :Some of Saotome's deeds go beyond simple enhancement of human physical skills: he can perform authentic feats of magic in the same fashion as Oga, such as sealing a dimensional hole open by Oga in the roof of the volleyball court and dispatching Behemoth's subordinates (see below) back to the demon world. When he uses his powers to seal the hole, the pulse of energy is felt, other than by Hilda, by six characters that are thus identified as possessing of notable strength for humans: Oga, two Touhoushinki (Kunieda and Tojo) and three Horsemen (Izuma, Miki and Shizuka). This event seems to set apart which humans in the story are fit for celebrating contracts with demons: Oga is already a contractor, being chosen by baby Beel; Izuma has demon blood in him and Kunieda is soon targeted by a demon for this very purpose. :Later, it is revealed that Saotome took part in some sort of war in the Demon World, and was a respected champion in that conflict.Chapter 120 Ikaruga Suiten (see below) states that a limitation to Saotome's use of demon power, as opposed to Oga's, is that Saotome does not master Black Techs and thus cannot allow himself to merge with his demon. ;Genma Isurugi :First appearance: chapter 78 :St. Ishiyama's Headmaster. An old man who knows of the demon world and, like Saotome, has access to information from there. He also offers protection to young people who are trying to cope with their demon powers by accepting them into his school. It is implied that Izuma is not the only descendant of demons currently enrolled at St. Ishiyama. He can feel demonic energy like Saotome and realises immediately when members of the 34th Pillar Squad (see below) arrive in the city. When fighting, his muscles expand quickly and he can launch very powerful strikes.Chapter 117 ; :First appearance: chapter 48 :The first homeroom teacher of the Ishiyama class at St. Ishiyama prior to Saotome's arrival. Bespectacled, and at first overconfident on his ability to exert control over the thugs, he quickly fails to do so, when his attempts to intimidate them by means of authority, strength or coercion backfire badly. He later becomes attached to the group and supports them in the volleyball match, and is greatly disappointed to be replaced by Saotome. ; :First appearance: chapter 51 :A teacher in charge of student life, he sustains an impassive expression when dealing with pupils and tries to enforce his authority over Ishiyama students, first by threatening to expel Kunieda and Oga if they do not restrain their colleagues; later, by deciding on the expulsion of Oga, all the Touhoushinki, Furuichi and Natsume. However, he is outmaneuvered by Himekawa and ends up agreeing to the condition of removing the Horsemen's authority in case Ishiyama win the volleyball match, which they do. During Kiriya and Teimou's plot, he keeps his cool and even threatens expulsion in case either of the opposing sides resorts to violence. Demon World In the Beelzebub series, the demon world bears little resemblance to Christian or Jewish Demonologies. It is described as a realm in another dimension that is inhabited by many fantastic creatures and ruled by the royal dynasty of the Beelzebubs. From what can be inferred, the way of life has traits of common medieval fiction stories, but at the same time contemporary devices such as video games are known. However, the technology seems to be slightly behind the human world's, as Lord En (see below) is shocked by how advanced a PlayStation 2 is. The Beelzebubs' power is not uncontested, though: there are rogues and thieves and other people living outside of the royal family's authority. Demons still have an intent to destroy Man, as in Western belief; however, they are not immortal and can be killed in a similar way to humans, although they are more powerful. They may have many different shapes, but most of those who interact with Oga and other humans are also human-like, with minor anatomical differences in some cases, such as reptilian ears, fangs or spots on the skin. ; : :First appearance: One-shot :The Devil King and Baby Beel's father. He is referred to as the third Beelzebub in chapter 48, so his full name may be Kaiser de Emperana Beelzebub III. He is a tall figure with long light-colored hair, wearing a helmet with two prominent, cartoonish horns and dressed in a long cape, who is always pictured from behind. His main characteristic, often alluded to in the course of the series, is being \\"extremely random\\". He spends his time mostly playing karaoke or video games, and has twice decided to destroy mankind out of pure whim: however, his schedule full of ceremonies and engagements prevents him from going on his own, and thus he whimsically decides to send his children: first Baby Beel, then Lord En. ; : :First appearance: chapter 27 :A former imperial doctor to the royal family. He has the appearance of a tall, dark-haired man, but in the human world he takes up a provisional body due to his contempt of humans. This body is similar to one of Lamia's (see below) \\"muumuu\\" pets, a random mass with a pair of eyes that can float above the ground at times. He is able to read minds. A highly skilled physician, he is first brought by Hilda in order to diagnose baby Beel, and is able to devise a cure for the kid by reestablishing his bond to Oga. He comes back later to treat Hilda's wound. Foras and Saotome know each other, but the nature of the acquaintance, as Saotome's connection to the demon world, is currently unknown. His name is probably a reference to a demon of the same name. It is later revealed that Forcas current position is as doctor to the 34th Pillar Squad (see below). ; : :First appearance: chapter 28 :A demon doctor who is very small. Lamia comes to the human world in her capacity as Dr. Rachmaninorr's assistant to help in treating baby Beel and later takes care of Oga's wounds after a confrontation with a demon. Like her boss, she can read minds, even baby Beel's, although she does not do it very often.Chapter 43 She disapproves of Oga as Beel's parent, but reluctantly accepts it after his battle with Tojo. Although she seemed cold and hostile upon their first encounter, she thanks Oga for saving her after the incident in the demon world. She is very protective of Baby Beel and greatly respects Hilda, whom she refers to as \\"Hilda-nee-san.\\" Her name is possibly an allusion to the mythological demon. Later in the series, she seeks Furuichi's help to find Lord En on Hilda's request. Furuichi suspects her of being a tsundere character. Lamia carries a pistol loaded with bullets containing demonic concoctions that can erase memories, force a person to do one's bidding or, in the case of Oga, trap him in a psychic loop. She is always accompanied by two small muumuu pets, one of which sits atop her head and often mimics her mood. Her age is unspecified, but her appearance is that of a preteen girl. Her mother is general Laymia of the 34th Pillar Squad (see below). ; : :First appearance: chapter 44 :Alaindelon's beautiful daughter. Like her father, she is a transdimensional demon. A naturalist, she is currently stationed in the outskirts of Vlad's Haunt to study its ecosystem. She seems to be a bit foolish and absent-minded. ;Lord En :First appearance: chapter 80 :Baby Beel's elder brother, sent by their father to help in destroying mankind. He is a very spoiled, pompous child and a video game addict. However, he seems to be extremely powerful, on par with his brother: if he cries, he will destroy everything up to a radius of 15 km in a sea of flames. An example of this happens in chapter 138, when he incinerates Akumano Academy (see below). He is also lazy and a crybaby, and is not as interested in destroying mankind as he is in clearing video games. Lord En seems to have a crush on Lamia and even calls her his wife, but she does not reciprocate. His juvenile canine teeth are actually fangs and the left one is slightly longer. He has green hair like his brother and is attended by three wet nurses: :Yolda (first appearance: chapter 80) is Hilda's younger sisterChapter 129 and bears a strong resemblance to her. She carries a mop and uses it as a weapon much as Hilda uses her umbrella. The two seem to have an unsettled score and Yolda positively despises Hilda. She is also able to move very quickly and knocks Furuichi and Kunieda out easily. In contrast to Hilda, she has a femme fatale attitude. It is later revealed that she is a dimensional transfer demon like Alaindelon; her powers are said to be even greater than his, and she is able to distort dimensions and create sections of space detached from the physical world. Despite not being as competent as Hilda, she is fiercely loyal to Lord En, to the point of allowing herself to be imprisoned so she can stay close to her master. :Sachura (first appearance: chapter 80) wears her long black hair in two braids and appears to be the youngest of the nurses. She brings Lord En his drinks. Her weapons are two pistols. :Isabella (first appearance: chapter 80) leads the three nurses and has a cold, serious attitude. She wears glasses and carries a book of incantations that she uses to cater for Lord En's needs and whims. ;Athrun :First appearance: chapter 43 :A powerful demon who appears for the first time in Angelica's house in the demon world. At first, he appears to be working on commission of the thieves' leader, but later he saves Oga and the others from being stomped flat by the giant baby Beel. He considers killing Oga when he seems unable to summon Beel to him and revert him to his original size, but Oga instinctively succeeds in doing so and Athrun changes his mind. :He is able to teleport himself by using stones that Lamia describes as byproducts of dimensional transfer demons, and is last seen reporting to mysterious parties on his encounter with Oga. He is then told by his superiors that he will meet Oga again in the human world. ;Postman :First appearance: chapter 156 :A demon who delivers letters to the human world. He has long blond hair and is constantly smiling. Because his method of delivery consists of letting the package fall from the sky, usually causing some damage, he tends to be on the receiving end of Oga's hostility, with comic effect. ;Tama-and-Pochi :First appearance: chapter 163 :Called by Hilda a \\"demon of embodiment\\", Tama-and- Pochi is an artificial demon made by the Great Demon Lord to protect a painting he made of Baby Beel's mother, known in the human world as \\"the demon's portrait\\". Tama-and-Pochi has the appearance of a teenage girl, uses a crescent moon-shaped sickle as a weapon and her power is the \\"demon script\\": those under its effect see their companion's defects amplified a hundredfold, which causes any party of people greater than two who sees the painting to devolve into man-on-man fights until there is only one left standing. This did not work on Oga and Beel, though, because they don't believe they have any defects and actually rejoice on what would disgust others. :Tama-and-Pochi is nearly as random as her creator, and can actually fall asleep on the spot, even while standing, and while asleep she often urinates on herself. ;Mrs Iris :First appearance: chapter 165 (portrait) :Beel's mother. An extremely beautiful woman whom Hilda originally served and considers an older sister. The Demon's Portrait, painted by the Demon King, is a picture of hers. Her whereabouts haven't been revealed yet. =34th Pillar Squad= A military division that works directly under Lord En. It consists of ten divisions, each one commanded by a \\"Pillar Head\\" (or Lieutenant General), who may have one or more \\"Pillars\\" (or Brigadier General) under their command, for a total of 24. Each Pillar has 15 \\"Peons\\" under them. Ranking officers wear black, peons wear white leather coats. Pillar Heads' names are normally borrowed from mythical or literary dragons or dragon-like creatures; they have special powers and can be distinguished by their fringed epaulettes. Pillars have alphabetic names and are tattooed, each tattoo representing a letter of the demonic alphabet. Their loyalty and deference to En is unwavering, sometimes with comic effect. Behemoth (first appearance: chapter 116) is the squad's founder and its former leader with the rank of general of the army. At least in the human world, he has the appearance of an eccentric, oddly dressed old man. He is named after the biblical beast. In contrast to the Demon Lord, who could not care less whether Beel or En is the one to destroy humanity, Behemoth wants En to prevail and be advanced as the rightful heir to the throne. He then sends his subordinates to the human world in order to kill Beel's contractor. Later, he builds a school (Akumano Academy, \\"Akumano\\" meaning \\"demon's\\") for Lord En in the place of the destroyed Ishiyama and populates it both with the other members of the squad and with Ishiyama's lesser thugs, who underwent some sort of brainwashing in the process. After the Squad is defeated by Oga and Akumano is burnt by En's crying, Behemoth and the rest of the Squad remain stuck in the human world. Jabberwock (first appearance: chapter 120), named after Lewis Carroll's character, is Behemoth's son and just appointed successor as leader of the squad, with the same rank as his father. He has a massive constitution and a big transversal scar across his face. His attitude is haughty and he immediately dismisses Oga as an unworthy opponent on first meeting him. Jabberwock then proceeds to have his pet dragon Sodom (described as a \\"Grand Bahamut\\") kidnap Hilda by swallowing her alive. He seems to respect Saotome and wishes to face him in battle, but is more reluctant than his father to be under the leadership of Lord En's, to whom he refers as a stupid kid. His recklessness has earned him the nickname \\"Crazy Dragon\\". Jabberwock is very powerful; the Zebub Emblem and even Super Milk Time seem to be ineffective against him, but he develops a little amount of respect for Oga on fighting him for the first time. His nasty temper got him expelled from the squad at a point, but he was readmitted by his father. Jabberwock is eventually defeated by Oga and Beel after a fierce battle. He has his own squadron, whose members seem to have a bad reputation with the rest of the Squad due to their lack of honour.Chapter 133 They include three personal Pillars:Chapter 136 :Lunana is a dark-skinned, stocky woman with a detached expression who seems to be able to move extremely quickly. :Lindworm, first glimpsed on chapter 123, wears a chest plate and has long dark hair, as well as a mischievous attitude. :Kirin has fair hair, wields two batons fitted with blades and is blindfolded. A number of Pillar Heads have been presented, as well as some Pillars working under them. Naga (first appearance: chapter 85) is first introduced alongside Graffel (see below) when the latter attacks Izuma and Tojo, but maintains a detached attitude that contrasts with Graffel's violence. He rushes with Graffel to Hecadoth's aid against Saotome, only to be dispatched to the demon world by the teacher. It is later revealed that he is known as the Water Dragon King and his power is way above Hecatos' and Graffel's. His black aura often takes the shape of a dragon. He is probably named after the Hindu deity. Naga is eventually defeated by Oga and Beel's Super Milk Time. :Hecadoth (first appearance: chapter 83) is the 8th Pillar. He begins his attack on Oga and the others by imprisoning Kunieda with the intention to use her blood to forge a demon contract; it is understood that the already powerful demons increase their power in the human world considerably if they find a contractor. It seems that the contract itself is not necessarily consensual. :However, Hecadoth looks down on Hilda and Oga and, instead of proceeding to seal the contract, he allows them to have a shot at him. The two succeed in surprising him with Oga's Zebub Blast, while Hilda releases Kunieda. Hecadoth, who had planned for that, uses the opportunity to impale Hilda with his spear, putting her out of combat. He then proceeds to face Oga, and is only prevented from killing him by Saotome's intervention, whereby he is sent back to the demon world. His spear fails to kill Hilda thanks to Kunieda's first aid and Dr. Rachmaninoff's timely intervention, but it puts the demon maid out of action for some time, since it has the property of diffusing demonic powers around the wound. :Later, Hecadoth meets Hilda again, but this time she is at the top of her powers and unhindered, and attacks him fiercely. Before he can retaliate, Oga arrives from his training with Saotome and takes up the fight from Hilda. He defeats Hecadoth easily and the demon is the first victim of the Zebub Emblem. :Graffel (first appearance: chapter 85), the 7th Pillar, also works under Naga and is first presented when he interrupts Tojo and Izuma's fight, having been attracted to it by Izuma's demonic energy. He is very proud of his power and considers humans and lower demons inferior, and nearly kills Tojo and Izuma before sensing Saotome's attack on Hecatos and rushing to his aid. He is sent back to the demon world by Saotome. He is later the first victim of Oga and Beel's Super Milk Time. :Graffel is general Yata's younger brother, although Yata considers him a good-for-nothing. Despite this assessment, his loyalty to Lord En is such that, alongside Hecadoth and Naga, he takes the initiative to kill Oga without authorisation from the Squad's leadership, and is ready to give his life to attain that goal. After their second defeat, he and Hecadoth are seen imprisoned in Akumano High's dungeon.Chapter 132 Laymia (first appearance: chapter 102) is a Pillar Head and Lamia's mother. She seems to be one of Behemoth's closest advisors. Although her daughter sides with Beel, she is one of the main architects in the plot to kill Oga and deprive the demon baby of his Contractor. She is a tall woman with an unfathomable expression who is seen heading a meeting of the Squad's officers. :Agiel (first appearance: chapter 118), the first Pillar, is a cheerful, slim girl in Laymia's division who is extremely strong and violent and who becomes obsessed with Aoi after being defeated by her. :Odonel (first appearance: chapter 118), the 14th Pillar and also under Laymia, is a short man whose head is completely covered in bandages and who is first shown with his arms tied up to his torso. Quetzalcoatl (first appearance: chapter 119) is Harlequin-like in appearance and has the ability to control people's minds. He uses this power on Lord En's orders to turn all of Ishiyama's former students who did not go to St. Ishiyama into slaves to corner Furuichi and the others. He then challenges the Ishiyama gang to a game with their lives on the line. He is named after the Mesoamerican deity. Basilisk (first appearance: chapter 102) is a large, scarred, hirsute man who is seen smoking a cigar with his feet on the table at the meeting Laymia headed. His weapon of choice is a giant ax, and he has the power to immobilise his opponents if they look at him in the eye. Oga falls for the trick, but Beel stops the ax and both defeat Basilisk using Super Milk Time. His power and name are adapted from the Greek mythological monster. Salamander (first appearance: chapter 102) is a fair-haired young man whose light demeanour and warm smile contrast with the offhand way he discusses executing Graffel and Hecatos for disobedience. His power, Lost Prominence, is a fire that burns memories instead of matter, and which can also be used for mind control. His namesake is the mediaeval mythical creature. Yata (first appearance: chapter 102) is a young swordsman seen in the meeting headed by Laymia. In the occasion he proposed executing Graffel and Hecatos ‚Äì even though Graffel is his brother ‚Äì for attacking Oga without an express order to do so. His power consists of wielding his katana at supersonic speed. His name is probably a derivation of the Japanese deity. In addition to these characters, the meeting mentioned above introduced Vritra, a woman with a cold attitude. Tojo's return in chapter 132 pits him against Yinglong, a tall man with a ponytail. Ananta, first glimpsed in chapter 123, is a girl with odango hair who battles Kunieda on chapter 134. Finally, a number of Pillars have made quick appearances. Zela, the 24th, is a tall blond man introduced with Agiel and Odonel while standing sentry at Akumano Academy. When Oga attacks Akumano High (chapter 131), he meets and defeats Din (4th), a young man with shoulder-length black hair; Kne (10th), who wears a French-style beret; Labed (11th), who sports dreadlocks; Wasboga (21st), who wears sideboards; Xoblah (22nd), a plump man who is knocked out by Oga on first sight; and Yshiel (23rd), a blond swordswoman with a patch over her left eye. On chapter 133, Tojo defeats Cemor (3rd), a man with light, pointy hair; and Nebak (13th), a short man with an African lion mask. On chapter 134, Kunieda faces Elim (5th), a little girl in oversized clothes who wields a cane; Fabas (6th), a punk who fights with two backswords; Pamiel (15th), a Hippie who uses a dagger; and Tiriel (19th), a long-haired blonde who uses two swords. On chapter 135, Oga meets Schethalim (18th), a light-haired man first glimpsed in chapter 133; and Vabam (20th), an anthropomorphic dog; both of whom use pistols. Others ; : :First appearance: One-shot :Oga's older sister and the first leader of the Red Tails. A young adult now, she is nevertheless still violent and scares even Oga and Furuichi, but seems to get along with Hilda very well. As Oga's parents, she seems easily to accept the strange events happening around her brother ever since Hilda and Baby Beel arrived, even when blatantly supernatural beings like Forkas appear (she is seen being massaged by him in chapter 38). She is under the assumption that Hilda, Beel and the others are from Macao (apparently having mistaken it from the word Makai, the Japanese word for the demons' dwelling). ;Reiji Kiriya :First appearance: chapter 66 :Also known as the Viper, he is a vicious thug who is at the centre of Oga and Miki's story. His cunning and thirst for revenge gain him the leadership of Teimou Academy's skinheads, who are driven by him to take St. Ishiyama hostage in order to get back at Oga. He wears the hair in black power style and his face has three vertical scars carved by Oga using Kiriya's own nails, in retribution for his attack on Miki. :His plan for revenge ultimately backfires when the Red Tails and the Six Knights capture his underlings and Oga and Miki defeat Teimou's shadow group (see below). After being badly injured by Oga's Zebub Blast, he hallucinates and takes Oga himself for a devil, and crawls away in mortal fear. ;Teimou's shadow group First appearance: chapter 74 The four strongest fighters of Teimou Academy, they ruled over Teimou from the shadows under Kiriya's orders while the latter was in hiding. They are defeated by Oga and Miki, and later go to the Shingetsu Temple to become stronger and get back at St. Ishiyama, only to find Oga already there and be badly beaten again. They are nevertheless taken in by Kunieda's grandfather and begin their training alongside Oga, in what seems to be a temporary truce. :Kotaro Mikagami wears a jumper with a hood and several piercings and rings. He is able to pull several punches of great strength in a matter of seconds. He later develops a crush on Aoi Kunieda, exploited in the story for comedic effect. :Unsho Onizuka is very heavily built and relies on sheer strength to overcome his opponents. He and Mikagami are defeated by Oga in one punch. :Kosei Kuroki is a plain skinhead who wields a three-section staff. He is able to repel an attack from Miki, but is later defeated by his Black Owl Killer. :Takumi Dezaki is a bespectacled, homosexual man and a very capable fighter who deals a heavy blow on Miki. He is not directly defeated by Miki, but is caught in Oga's Zebub Blast directed at Kiriya. He seems to have a crush on Mikagami and is jealous of the latter's interest in Kunieda. ;Ittousai Kunieda : :First appearance: chapter 39 :Kunieda's grandfather and instructor, the master of the Shingetsu martial arts style is a strong old man who sports long white hair and a moustache. He has a violent personality and, on meeting Oga for the first time, drags him to a brief spar, and is actually victorious. Seeing potential in Oga, he offers to train him if he wants to become stronger. :When Oga decides to take his offer, Kunieda smiles mischievously and begins by ordering Oga to perform a number of household chores, to his great dismay. Later he takes up Teimou's shadow group and leads them all into a training excursion, first ordering them to break stones with their bare hands. He is a very stern man with a hair-trigger temper, and adopts an attitude of fighting first, asking questions later. :Not only does he know about demons and the demon world, but he also recognises Oga as a contractor and decides to train him to use demonic powers. He engages Saotome's assistance to this end, much to Oga's dismay. The three adults who know of the demon world so far - Kunieda, Saotome and Isurugi - are united in their goals and are shown together for the first time facing Behemoth. ;Kouta Kunieda : :First appearance: chapter 10 :Kunieda's little brother. An infant about the same age Beel, the two first meet in the park when Oga tries to get Beel to fight him. Since Beel is weak when not in contact with Oga, Kouta won the match by simply forcing Beel off the park bench. Since that, the two have developed a rivalry, and in all their encounters so far, Kouta has come out on top. He seems to be somewhat evil like Beel, and to enjoy tormenting the baby demon. Their rivalry is a regular source of comedy in the story. In the anime, the two babies are friendlier towards each other. ;Isafuyu Kashino :First appearance: chapter 94 Voiced by: Saori Hayami :The shy young daughter of the keeper of the Mapputatsu shrine, she is first introduced when Grandpa Kunieda takes Oga and the others to spend the night there. She immediately recognises Baby Beel's true nature and is greatly scared of him. She is described by Kunieda as very spiritually aware and, besides demons, can detect the presence of ghosts and perform exorcisms. Kunieda requests her help to learn how to defeat a demon, with a view to fighting the 34th Pillar Squad, as Oga and Tojo. Isafuyu then introduces Kunieda to the minor god Koma. ;Koma :First appearance: chapter 115 :Describing himself as a minor god, Koma is a komainu, although he used the literal meaning of his kind's name to pass for a tengu when he inhabited the Mapputatsu shrine. Although she had never actually seen him, Isafuyu used to borrow his powers whenever she needed to exorcise demons, and took Kunieda to his abode when she requested assistance in this regard. :Koma at first demurs and threatens to sever his agreement with Isafuyu, but becomes interested in Kunieda when he realises she can hear his voice. He then reveals to be quite perverted, trying to get Kunieda to answer questions about her growth and underwear, and revealing that he posed the same questions to Isafuyu in exchange for assistance. Kunieda then becomes enraged and uses her swordstyle to attack Koma's house and force him to reveal himself. He then agrees to help her and becomes her companion, not without showing interest in the Red Tails in the process. In chapter 118 he assumes the form of a gigantic wolf-like creature when he is preparing to fight alongside Kunieda, and in the following chapter he is recognised by Odonel as a 'sicarion' (maybe a corruption of Sicarii), a member of a family of demons who were exiled into the human world after being defeated in war. With his power, Kunieda's swordsmanship is improved enough so that she can face off against Hilda or Agiel. :He can conceal his presence and remain hidden from sight, including from other demons. Even when he is not actively hiding, he can normally be seen or heard only by people who are either spiritually aware or stronger than the average human. A partial exception seems to be Furuichi: despite being extremely weak, he can sense a presence filling the space around Kunieda in chapter 119, even if he doesn't see Koma. He can become visible if he decides so. ;Mr Takahashi :First appearance: chapter 123 :A formerly unemployed teacher who inadvertently jumps at the opportunity of a new job and is hired by Behemoth to keep a veneer of normalcy in Akumano Academy by teaching Lord En and the officers, with comic effect. ;Ikaruga Suiten :First appearance: chapter 124 :Formerly known as Ikaruga Nazuna, she is a priestess in a temple in the isolated Decapitation Island. Saotome sends Oga and Kunieda to learn from her how to use a demon's powers by merging with them - the skill behind Super Milk Time, known as Black Techs. :Ikaruga is referred to by Saotome and Grandpa Kunieda as unreliable and a snake, but she nevertheless acquiesces to teaching Oga and Kunieda. She moves around in a motorbicycle and can be quite violent when challenged. She can also \\"shoot\\" things without a pistol, using her fingers to send some kind of power towards the target. :It is later revealed that Ikaruga and Saotome were colleagues at Ishiyama, and that she used to have feelings for him. Like Kunieda, she led a girl gang. She also knows Kunieda's mother, whom she considers her better in martial skill. ;Futaba Kanzaki :First appearance: chapter 143 :Kanzaki's niece by his elder brother. She is an extremely spoiled, four-year-old brat who continually abuses his family and their yakuza underlings. She recruits Beel as her \\"lackey\\" and becomes jealous when Chi Aiba (see below) appears with Beel in tow.:Chapter 151 ;Mugen Kanzaki :First appearance: chapter 144 :Kanzaki's father and the boss of the Ishiyama yakuza. Despite this, he is a doting grandfather who is completely manipulated by Futaba and mainly responsible for spoiling her. =South Chinpira High School= :An all-male delinquent school met by Oga and the other thugs during their field trip to Okinawa. They idolise Ishiyama High as the ultimate delinquent school and have emulated many of their customs, to the point of their four strongest thugs calling themselves Touhoushinki:Chapter 148 Kamiya wears a chain piercing and copies Kanzaki's taste for yoghurt, Higashiyama is bulky like Tojo, and Himeji wears Hawaii-style shirts and a pompadour like Himekawa. Kunihiko, being a man, does not copy Kunieda but sports his Touhoushinki kanji character on a mask over his mouth. Ironically, on their first meeting, they are unaware that Oga and the others belong to Ishiyama and mutual hostility instantly arises. It is later found that they are considerably weaker than their Ishiyama counterparts. ;Izou Aiba :First appearance: chapter 147 :The king of South Chinpira High and Oga's counterpart there. He is immensely strong, apparently on par with Oga but, contrarily to the latter, he does fulfill his role as the leader of his school's thugs, controls them and is followed without question. His temperament is much lighter than Oga's. He feels instantly attracted to Aoi and tries to get a date with her, much to the Red Tails' chagrin. His signature move is an extremely powerful finger flick that can send an average human flying a long distance. However, like Oga, he does not seem to pick fights, but will mercilessly use his power to punish his underlings if they misbehave. When they finally fight, Oga defeats him, but no hard feelings are born afterwards and Aiba tells Aoi he will be back eventually to try and woo her again.Chapter 155 ;Chiyo Aiba :First appearance: chapter 147 :Izou's little sister, a four-year-old who falls for Beel on first sight. She is quite precocious and can already read, having developed a taste for fortune-telling and the Western Zodiac. She normally travels on a carrier strapped to Izou's back. =San Marx Private Fine Arts Academy= :An absurdly posh school in a valley in the countryside, attended by children of political and economical elites from Japan and abroad. Himekawa used to attend it until he was 15. ;Kugayama :First appearance: chapter 160 :The student at the top of the social hierarchy at San Marx, always seen escorted by bodyguards in black suits. Kugayama is the only person to have outwitted Himekawa, and there seems to be some bitterness between the two. The student is the current owner of the Demon's Portrait and knows about the existence of demons, having seen Tama- and-Pochi while in possession of the painting. Due to an androginous appearance and the donning of a male uniform, Kugayama was originally thought by Oga and the others to be a man, but they were proven otherwise in chapter 167: Kugayama is a girl and her family and Himekawa's had actually agreed that the two would marry. While she has been in love with him for a long time, his stance on the matter is not yet known. Kugayama is an ambitious woman who wants to rise politically, and is also a skilled fighter, having been able to break the forearm of a man effortlessly.

Reiley, AIA, (1878‚Äì1961) was an American architect practicing in New York City in the early and mid twentieth century. He was particularly known as a designer of Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals in the Northeast USA. Early life and architectural education Reiley was born in New York City and was educated in the local public school system. He attended the prestigious Jesuit school, Xavier High School (New York City), and Columbia Grammar School, both college preparatory schools, in New York City. He graduated from the Columbia School of Architecture in 1900 and continued his alumni networking there throughout the rest of his career. Following graduation, he worked the next two years a draftsman in the office of Ernest Flagg from 1900 to 1902 and later as supervisor of construction for Van Vleck and Goldsmith from 1902 to 1903. After a period of European travel and study in Paris from 1903 to 1904, he then entered into a partnership with fellow Columbia graduate Gustave E. Steinback. The firm, known as Reiley and Steinback continued in practice from 1904 through 1913 and was responsible for many buildings for Roman Catholic clients throughout the Eastern United States.Francis Morrone (Photography by James Iska), An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn (Layton, Utah: Gibbs Smith, 2001), p.276 After the partnership was dissolved, both men went on to lengthy careers designing Roman Catholic churches, with Reiley's firm known as Robert J. Reiley. Architectural practice Robert J. Reiley practiced under his own name from 1913 until 1952 when he took his son, Robert J. Reiley Jr. into partnership and renamed the firm Robert J. Reiley & Associates. His main client remained the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York for which he designed a number of churches and associated structures.Office for Metropolitan History, \\"Manhattan NB Database 1900-1986,\\" (Accessed 27 Dec 2010). His office was located at 50 East 41 Street from the 1920s and 45 West 45th Street in the 1950s. During his career, he was licensed to practice architecture in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia. The firm had a staff of around twenty and banked with the Guaranty Trust Company, Fifth Avenue and 44th Street, New York City. Several later noteworthy architects began their careers in his office including Louis M. Thorn and Brother Cajetan Baumann, OFM (1899‚Äì1969), a Franciscan who was to design many modern buildings mostly for Franciscan clients in the middle part of the 20th century. Personal life Reiley was involved with a number of Catholic organizations. He was the director of the Catholic Camp Association, as well as the Alumni Federation of Columbia University, and Committee Chairman of Catholic Charities. During World War I, he worked on a housing project and during World War II, he designs hospitals and community buildings for service men. Reiley has at least one son, the architect Robert J. Reiley Jr. (born 22 March 1914 in New York City), whom he took into partnership in 1952 renaming his firm Robert J. Reiley & Associates.

He became the Member of Parliament for Wicklow County in 1703, and was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1709; he was Lord Chief Justice 1714-1727. He is principally remembered for the hatred he aroused in Jonathan Swift, who among many other insults called him a \\"vile and profligate villain\\", and compared him to William Scroggs, the English Chief Justice of the 1670s, who was notorious for corruption. These attacks were the result of the trial of Edward Waters, Swift's publisher, for seditious libel, where Whitshed's conduct of the trial was widely condemned as improper,Ball p.96 and of Whitshed's unsuccessful efforts to have another publisher indicted for bringing out The Drapier Letters.Ball pp.103-5 Background and early career He was born in Dublin to a long established family of Dublin merchants who played a prominent part in politics; his father Thomas Whitshed (1645- 1697) sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Carysfort and was also a practicing barrister.Ball p.189 His mother was Mary Quin, daughter of Mark Quin, who became one of Dublin's richest citizens and was Lord Mayor of Dublin 1667-8, and his wife Mary Roche. William was the eldest of thirteen children. His grandfather Mark Quin had committed suicide in 1674 by cutting his throat with a razor in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, reputedly because he believed that his wife was unfaithful to him, a fact which Swift and other enemies of Whitshed later seized on to embarrass him. James Quin, one of the most famous actors of his time, was the son of Whitsed's uncle, the elder James Quin (died 1710), another barrister. The younger James unsuccessfully claimed a share of the Quin fortune, but could not prove that his parents had been lawfully married. James Quin, the leading actor, who was Whitshed's first cousin Whitshed entered Middle Temple in 1694 and was called to the Irish Bar. He did not have any great reputation as a lawyer or politician and his rapid rise to power caused some surprise;Ball p.81 in particular, his elevation to the office of Lord Chief Justice when he was little more than 35 years old was most unusual, if not unprecedented. Ball attributes his success to his family's wealth and political connections, and the friendship of William King, Archbishop of Dublin, who had considerable though not unlimited influence over judicial appointments. Conflict with Swift Whitshed's ambition was by I no means satisfied by becoming Chief Justice: he hoped with Archbishop King's support to become Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and it may have been this ambition which led him into the conflict with Jonathan Swift which so greatly harmed his reputation. In 1720 he presided at the trial of Edward Waters for seditious libel, in that he had printed Swift's pamphlet On the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture. The result was something of an embarrassment since while Waters was found guilty, this was only after the jury had tried nine times to bring in a verdict of not guilty. Swift, quite unperturbed, contented himself with satirising Whitshed and Godfrey Boate, the junior judge at the trial.Sir Walter Scott Life of Jonathan Swift Vol.1 Edinburgh 1814 pp.281-2 In 1724 the Crown moved against Swift again. John Harding, the printer of the Drapier Letters, was arrested and efforts were made to identify and apprehend \\"Drapier\\" (although there was can have been little doubt in Government circles as to his real identity). Whitshed was pressed into service to persuade a grand jury to find that the Drapier Letters were seditious.Scott pp.281-2 This time the result was complete failure: although Whitshed spared no efforts, interviewing the jurors individually, they refused to give a guilty verdict.Ball pp.103-5 Swift, by now thoroughly enraged, attacked Whitshed in a series of verses, notably Verses Occasioned by Whitshed's motto on his Coach, with a venom which few judges have ever had to endure. Swift's friends joined the battle, and even painful personal details like the suicide of Whitshed's grandfather, and his grandmother's supposed adultery, were dragged up: \\"In church your grandsire cut his throat.... [your] grandame had gallants by the twenties, and bore your mother to a prentice\\".Ball pp.103-5 The Government, embarrassed by the whole affair and conscious that public opinion was on Swift's side, did little to protect their Chief Justice. Last years Whitshed's hopes of becoming Lord Chancellor were never realised: his patron Archbishop King was steadily losing influence to Hugh Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh, who was not an admirer of Whitshed. Further the Swift affair had made him bitterly unpopular: it was said frankly that it was impossible for a man so detested to be Lord Chancellor. In 1726 he asked to be transferred to the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), saying that the burden of his office was becoming too much for him as he aged. The following year it was decided to make him Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, but he died suddenly, aged only 48, shortly afterwards. His early death was blamed by some of his friends on the toll taken by vicious personal attacks on him by Swift and his supporters. He was unmarried and had no children: his estate passed to his next surviving brother.Ball p.189 While Swift's hatred of him is quite understandable, Ball notes that Whitshed as a young man was generally well- liked, although he became extremely unpopular in later life.Ball p.81 On the other hand another legal historian, Bartholomew Duhigg, accused Whitshed of deciding cases on the basis of personal prejudice and malice, although he accepts that the judge did not take bribes and that his personal life was blameless.Duhigg, Bartholemew History of the King's Inns (1806) References 1679 births 1727 deaths Irish MPs 1703‚Äì1713 Irish MPs 1713‚Äì1714 Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Wicklow constituencies Solicitors-General for Ireland Members of the Privy Council of Ireland People from Dublin (city) Lords Chief Justice of Ireland Chief Justices of the Irish Common Pleas ","title":"William Whitshed"},{"id":"30251256","text":"Louis Lyman Garland (July 16, 1905 ‚Äì August 30, 1990) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.

History  The new company made a rather ambitious appearance in the Greek press, announcing the introduction and production of a Greek automobile named Mini Jeep Scout 127, a versatile passenger-utility vehicle based on the Fiat 127. In reality, the car was not \\"Greek\\", as it was to be produced under license of the Italian Fissore company (which, in turn, had acquired the design by another Italian coachbuilder); it was nor really \\"built\\", as initially most parts were imported from Italy and assembled, with little local content; the company was hardly an \\"industry\\", as it started operation in a tiny facility; and, finally, the brand name Mini Jeep appeared only on paper (and that only for a brief period, since there was a conflict with the rights to the name by the U.S. Jeep company), as the vehicle carried the Fiat logo. Nonetheless, the introduction of the Scout 127 was quite successful. This kind of \\"smart\\" car was well fitted for the Greek market at the time. It could be used as a commercial vehicle as well as a passenger car (with certain off-road capabilities), while its design made it a fashionable \\"fun car\\". Most important, though, was a provision of Greek law that categorized such cars as \\"commercial vehicles\\" making them cheaper to own. Thus, A Ellados was the second (after Namco) in a series of Greek companies that introduced similar cars, claiming part of the market. As demand for the car increased, A Ellados built a larger factory in Thiva in 1978, while local content progressively increased to near 50%. The Scout 127 (in the meanwhile renamed Amico 127) received some facelifts by the company, which also presented a van version. In 1978 A Ellados developed a model of its own, the Poker 126, following similar philosophy, based on the Fiat 126 (this car wasn't as successful, as it sold only 253 units). Moreover, it assembled a number of other types, including the Fiat 238 and Fiat 900T vans. However, by 1984 the market for the passenger/utility cars had dramatically dropped, after a change in the Greek law (as it had been interpreted in ways that allowed luxury SUV‚Äôs to be classified as \\"trucks\\"). This evolution was a disaster for most Greek companies producing such vehicles, including A Ellados. The company ceased operations, after 6,620 vehicles had been produced, the vast majority (6,021) being Scout/Amico 127‚Äôs. Its facilities were acquired in 1988 by Automeccanica, a company founded in 1979 by former A Ellados executives.  References  * L.S. Skartsis and G.A.

The central idea is that each specification is a binary (boolean) expression that is true of acceptable computer behaviors and false of unacceptable behaviors. It follows that refinement is just implication. This is the simplest formal method, and the most general, applying to sequential, parallel, stand-alone, communicating, terminating, nonterminating, natural-time, real-time, deterministic, and probabilistic programs, and includes time and space bounds. Commands in a programming language are considered to be a special case of specification‚Äîthose specifications that are compilable. For example, if the program variables are x, y, and z, the command x:= y+1 is equivalent to the specification (binary expression) x'=y+1 ‚àß y'=y ‚àß z'=z in which x, y, and z represent the values of the program variables before the assignment, and x', y', and z' represent the values of the program variables after the assignment. If the specification is x'>y, we easily prove (x:= y+1) ‚áí (x'>y), which says that x:= y+1 implies, or refines, or implements x'>y. Loop proofs are greatly simplified. For example, if x is an integer variable, to prove that while x>0 do x:= x‚Äì1 od refines, or implements the specification x‚â•0 ‚áí x'=0, prove if x>0 then x:= x‚Äì1; (x‚â•0 ‚áí x'=0) else ok fi ‚áí (x‚â•0 ‚áí x'=0) where ok = (x'=x) is the empty, or do-nothing command. There is no need for a loop invariant or least fixed point. Loops with multiple intermediate shallow and deep exits work the same way. This simplified form of proof is possible because program commands and specifications can be mixed together meaningfully. Execution time (upper bounds, lower bounds, exact time) can be proven the same way, just by introducing a time variable. To prove termination, prove the execution time is finite. To prove nontermination, prove the execution time is infinite. For example, if the time variable is t, and time is measured by counting iterations, then to prove that execution of the previous while-loop takes time x when x is initially nonnegative, and takes forever when x is initially negative, prove if x>0 then x:= x‚Äì1; t:= t+1; (x‚â•0 ‚áí t'=t+x) ‚àß (x<0 ‚áí t'=‚àû) else ok fi ‚áí (x‚â•0 ‚áí t'=t+x) ‚àß (x<0 ‚áí t'=‚àû) where ok = (x'=x ‚àß t'=t).

Public celebrations and large gatherings were either held at the Fair Grounds on Elliott Street or on the Athletic Grounds at Rosalea Park, but both were considered by residents to be far from the centre of town and lacked the shade of trees. In 1902, Sir William J. Gage (owner of Gage Publishing, a publishing house specializing in school text books) purchased a 3.25 acres (1.3 hectares) part of the gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870. (Chisholm, a merchant and founding father of Brampton, had been the Town reeve, then warden of Peel County, then MPP for Brampton and eventually, Registrar of Peel County.)http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/chisholm_kenneth_13E.html Sir William donated 1.7 acres (0.7 hectares) of the property to the town, with a specific condition that it be made into a park. Citizens donated $1,054 and the town used the funds to purchase extra land to ensure a larger park. http://www.brampton.ca/EN/Arts-Culture-Tourism/alderlea/Pages/Alderlea- History.aspxhttps://www.bramptonguardian.com/community-story/5527696-alderlea- reborn-brampton-s-heritage-home-now-available-for-rent/ The Alder Lea mansion, whose surrounding property became part of Gage Park A park committee was appointed, consisting of members of the town council. Many trees were removed, gravelled walkways were prepared, all underbrush was removed and the land was levelled and seeded. W.J. Gage opened the park, the first municipal park in Brampton, on Dominion Day (Canada Day), 1903. Over the following years, a bandstand was erected and the Horticultural Society volunteered to properly label all the trees for the information of the general public. In 1955, the Kinsmen‚Äôs Club of Brampton added a wading pool, and in 1971 Brampton received the Flower Fountain from Benson and Hedges Tobacco Company. The Rotary Club of Brampton‚Äôs long-standing support of the park has seen the realization of many projects including swings in 1946, and the skating trail and entranceway with digital signage in the 1990s.http://www.brampton.ca/EN/residents/parks/Pages/Gage-Park.aspx The City of Brampton purchased Alderlea as part of its sesquicentennial and started major renovations and an expansion in 2010.

Almost all of its crew of 600 were killed, one thirds of the victims were Norwegians. History =Construction= Plan drawing Dannebroge was built in 1692 and she was the largest ship-of-the-line in the Dano-Norwegian navy at that time with her 84 cannons placed on two decks and a crew of 600 men. She was also the first ship in Denmark that was built according to a plan drawing. =The final battle= In 1710 Denmark‚ÄìNorway was at war with Sweden. The Norwegian-born commander, Ivar Huitfeldt, was in charge of Dannebroge on October 4, 1710. Along with a Dano-Norwegian fleet of 44 other ships he had set sail for LiepƒÅja (in modern Latvia). The mission was to escort 6,000 Russian troops to the Danish capital of Copenhagen, so they could support Denmark‚ÄìNorway during the Great Northern War against the Swedes. However, the fleet was intercepted by a Swedish fleet in the Battle of K√∏ge Bay. According to the commander in chief of the Dano- Norwegian navy, Ulrik Christian Gyldenl√∏ve, the fire on Dannebroge was probably ignited by her own cannons. Gyldenl√∏ve mentions this in his letter to the king. Gyldenl√∏ve followed the battle from his ship Elephanten and wrote the letter at about 9 o'clock in the morning of October 5. It is unclear how many of the 600 men survived the explosion: some sources say three and others say nine. =The wreck= The Langelinie Promenade with the Dannebroge monument. Today Dannebroge is the only wreck within Danish sea territory, where it is forbidden to dive. The official Danish institution of cultural heritage, Kulturarvsstyrelsen, considers it to be a cemetery. Some cannons were salvaged in 1714; others were salvaged in 1875 by the company Svitzer, which also searched for other objects that could be sold at an auction. Some of the cannons were later used by Danish architect Vilhelm Dahlerup, who made a monument for Dannebroge, which today can be found at Langelinie in Copenhagen.

It is situated in the Apuan Alps, and is known worldwide for the pork fat delicacy Lardo di Colonnata, and for its marble quarries. History Colonnata's history dates back to its settlement, around 40 BC. It was built for the housing of slaves used in quarrying marble after Rome decided to replace expensive imported Greek marble with local (Luni) marble. The name of the settlement is believed derived from the Latin word columna, indicating the place where columns of marble were extracted to be sent to Rome, but the origin of the name could also be the Latin collis (\\"hill\\") or columen ( \\"top\\"). The quarries may also have been used by the Ligurian Apuani tribe, who were perhaps also used later as quarrying experts. Evidence of mining activity dating back to the 6th century BC has been found at \\"Fossa Carbonera\\", Fantiscritti. Based on a stone found in 1810 bearing the names of the consuls of the years 16 - 22 AD, it appears that the settlement was run by settlers and a magistrate, all of servile origin, who oversaw the work. Additional records date back only to the 13th century, while the church of the village is believed to date back to the 12th century. It's possible, however, that in the Middle Ages Colonnata was used as a defensive stronghold for those who controlled these areas after the Roman Empire (the Byzantines, the Goths and Lombards). The village is still mainly supported by mining. The breeding of pigs, promoted by the abundance of chestnut trees, was introduced to Colonnata, perhaps by the Lombards. Over time, this industry evolved, in particular processing freshly slaughtered meat, which was used as bread spread by the quarrymen, thus starting the traditional production of the famous pork fat delicacy, Lardo di Colonnata. Geography =Location and quarrying= Colonnata is located in the Apuan Alps (mounts Maggiore, Spallone and Sagro), and is accessible by the road that passes through the villages of Vezzala and Bedizzano. The village is surrounded by quarries in an area known as \\"Gioia Calagio\\", which includes the Gioia Pit, which produces the arabescato and bardiglio varieties of veined marble. The quarry was also used in ancient times, as evidenced by the finds of coins, inscriptions engraved directly on the rock, and a relief of the Roman tutelary deity Silvanus. The largest Roman quarrying site yet discovered was one kilometre south at Fossacava. Places of interest The village has maintained some of its historic features, such as the use of marble in murals, doorways, doorjambs, windows and other architectural features. Also to be seen are the north gate into the town, which belonged to the medieval city walls now gone; a yard paved in marble located at the far south end of town; the Piazza Palestro, which leads to a modern sculpture dedicated to Cristo dei Cavatori (\\"Christ of the Quarrymen\\"); and the stone bell tower with a view and a clock. The sixteenth-century San Bartolomeo parish church has a marble interior, including a main altar in white marble, side altars in multi-coloured marble, a marble relief depicting the Assumption of Mary into heaven among the saints, preserved fragments of an ancon from the altar of Saints Andrew, Bartholomew and Peter, and a 17th- century marble crucifix attributed to a pupil of Michelangelo.

It is located at the corner of Math√¶usgade and Valdemarsgade and was completed in 1880 to design by city architect Ludvig Fenger. History St, Mathew's Church The decommissioning of Copenhagen's Bastioned Fortifications was a gradual and prolonged process. When a law in 1868 finally relinquished ownership of the fortifications and lifted the restrictions in the area immediately outside them, new residential districts sprang up outside the four former city gates which had been dismantled in 1868‚Äì69. This was also the case with Vesterbro outside the former Western City Gate which developed into a crowded and poor working-class neighbourhood. Constructed between 1879 and 1880, St. Matthew's Church was the first church to be built in the area. At that time the parish had around 2,000 inhabitants. Its architect was Ludvig Fenger who had just completed St. James' Church in √òsterbro. Up until the mid-1890s, St. Matthew's remained the only church in Vesterbro. At the turn of the 20th century the population had grown to about 7,000. Architecture Like many other Danish buildings of its time, St. Matthew's Church is inspired by North Italian Romanesque brick architecture. A distinctive feature of the exterior is the many pinnacles along the eaves as well as on the corners of the tower and at the base of the spire.  Interior  Most of the inventory is designed by Ludvig Fenger, including the organ case. The organ works were created by A. H. Busch & S√∏nner in 1880. The altarpiece is a mural painted directly on the wall behind the altar by Henrik Olrik depicting the Sermon on the Mount.

In other traditions around the world, Satrio Piningit has a similar other apocalyptic characters as Messiah (Judaism and Christianity), Maitreya (Buddhism), or related to Imam Mahdi prophecy in Islam. Jongko Joyoboyo (Jayabaya Prophecies) Maharaja Jayabaya was a King of Kediri in East Java from 1135 to 1157 A.D. and he was known for his righteousness and prosperous, coupled with reputed to have been an incarnation of the Hindu deity, Vishnu (Javanese: Dhewo Wisnu / Í¶¢Í¶ºÍ¶ÆÍ¶∫Í¶¥‚ÄãÍ¶ÆÍ¶∂Í¶±ÍßÄÍ¶§Í¶∏, Indonesian: Dewa Wisnu) so that he had a sort of magical strength (in which Javanese called sakti manduroguno). He is also believed that able to predict the future. Maharaja Jayabaya is the most famous for his oracles, most prophesies were attributed to him names the Serat Joyobhoyo Musoror, Serat Pranitiwekyo, and the rests are debatable amongst scholars. Jayabaya is also attributed as author of the \\"Pralembang Joyobhoyo\\", a prophetic book which played an important role on mind control in the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia (1942‚Äì1945). According to a selectively abridged set of stanzas within a Jayabaya prophesy (those all are extremely long epic poems): > \\"The Javanese would be ruled by whites for 3 centuries and by yellow dwarfs > for the life span of a maize plant prior to the return of the Ratu Adil: > whose the name must contain at least one syllable of the Javanese Noto > Nogoro.\\" Javanese-Indonesian language at Wikisource When Japan occupied the Dutch East Indies, in the first weeks of 1942, Indonesians came down in the streets shouting out to the Japanese army as the fulfillment of the prophecy ascribed to Joyoboyo, who foretold the day when white men would one day establish their rule on Java and tyrannize the people for hundreds years ‚Äì but they would be driven out by the arrival of yellow men from the north. These yellow dwarfs, Joyoboyo had predicted, would remain for one crop cycle, and after that Java would be freed from foreign domination. To most of the Javanese, Japan was a liberator: the prophecy had been fulfilled.R. B. Cribb, Audrey Kahin: 2004. Historical dictionary of Indonesia: Volume 51 of Historical dictionaries of Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East. Scarecrow Press, 2004. , . 583 pages. pp210 Jayabaya Prophecy of Satrio Piningit King Jayabaya predicted that Satrio Piningit would become a Great Leader of Nusantara. He wrote down that Satrio Piningit is a descendant of Majapahit's royal family, he was an Intelligent King, Honest, and Righteous. He would uphold justice around the world from Java (in the beginning, he will conquer Nusantara before it) so that he is also called as \\"Ratu Adil\\" (Indonesian: King of Justice, in Javanese, \\"Ratu\\" means \\"King\\" or \\"Queen\\"). According to Jayabaya, in the course of Satrio Piningit's life, he always has got a lot experience of miseries, always be humiliated, unlucky, and \\"kesapar\\" (poor). Therefore, he has got a nickname \\"Satrio Wiragung\\" (The Great Ksatria) due to his sincerity. Most Javanese people believe this prophecy. Satrio Piningit would not have served as a kind of Head of State (President or King) but greater than it. He would surely conquer the world before the end of the world. He would not be elected from the election, and never asks for elected. In other words, he would lead a massive revolution.

Yet Japan ruled by way of oppressing the people. Besides, Satrio Piningit was a Javanese, not Japanese. In post-independence, most Javanese people (until now) believe that Sukarno were Satrio Piningit. They claimed that Sukarno's character was quite similar to Satrio Piningit's. But most Indonesians do not believe it due to the prophecy by which Satrio Piningit would become a leader of the world, not only of Indonesia, and some Java-centric ethnical issues are also considered as rejection of the claim. And at the end of Sukarno's, Sukarno was treated kind of inhumanely by the New Order's Regime (1967‚Äì1998), starting from rejection of Sukarno's Nawaksara at MPRS court in 1966. Recently some Javanese sociologists considered Joko Widodo (7th President of Indonesia) as Satrio Piningithttps://www.merdeka.com/jakarta/5-tanda-tanda-jokowi-satrio-piningit- versi-sosiolog.html which became debatable during presidential election. Some of his opponents argued that putting Joko Widodo as Satrio Piningit was just propaganda in order to pronounce the election winner. Jayabaya's only tells about Satrio Piningit's rising from Java Island. He would lead Nusantara and the last, he would rule the world. Jayabaya does not tell about post-Satrio Piningit era which is considered as post-apocalyptic world, so that Satrio Piningit is just a mere open debatable interpretation. Interesting point, the Javanese believes Satrio Piningit should be formally taking a leadership office (such as king, or president).

Its first building, designed by Henry Austin (architect),O'Gorman, James F. Henry Austin: In Every Variety of Architectural Style. (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press), 2008 was constructed on Main Street just south of the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1842.

A History of St. John's Church, Hartford, Connecticut, 1841-1941 (West Hartford, Conn.: St. John's Parish), 1941 An activist organization, St. John's was instrumental in the development of other prominent Hartford area churches including the Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House (Hartford, Connecticut), St. John's Episcopal Church (East Hartford, Connecticut), and St. Monica's, the second Episcopal congregation in the state for Black Americans.\\"Colored Episcopalians: Meeting to Start a Church Held at St. John's Church.\\" The Hartford Courant, July 11, 1904, p. 7 As the nineteenth century progressed, the western suburbs became increasingly popular as a place for city dwellers to live with the result that the number of St. John's worshipers was in decline. In 1907, financier J. P. Morgan purchased the church building and its property for the construction of a memorial gallery to be added to Hartford's Wadsworth Atheneum. The parish then moved to suburban West Hartford, Connecticut, which was undergoing steady growth.\\"West Hartford: Large Increase in School Enumeration.\\" The Hartford Courant, November 25, 1899, p. 13 Hartford Church Building Designed by Henry Austin (architect), St. John's (Hartford) was the first church building attributed to that prolific artisan. Having assisted with design work for the nearby Wadsworth Atheneum, Austin created plans for a church building with a seating capacity of 850. At the time of its construction, St. John's reputedly had one of the tallest spires in New England. The Hartford Courant, quoting Chronicle of the Church, described the building as \\"a chaste and beautiful structure in the early pointed Gothic style, built of Chatham free stone...\\" and its interior as having a \\"chancel, with a massive rail, supported by mullions finished on either side.\\" Additionally, \\"there are side galleries, with a convenient choir over the vestibule, in which is placed an organ of superior finish and tone.\\"\\"Consecration of St. John's Church, Hartford.\\" The Hartford Courant, May 7, 1842, p. 2 That first organ was Opus 47, consisting of two manuals and twenty-two stops, by E. and G.G. Hook Organ of Boston. In 1861, the first Hook organ was replaced by Opus 295 of two manuals and thirty stops by the same manufacturer. As the years wore on, the church building began to show its age. The spire was eventually removed as the result of structural decay, the boiler became increasingly noisy, and finding space for the parish's many activities was becoming difficult.Wait, Gary E. A History of St. John's Church, 1841-1995. (West Hartford, Conn.: St. John's Church), 1996 These, and other factors, figured into the parish's ultimate decision to build a new church in suburban West Hartford, Connecticut. The last services were held in the Austin edifice in 1907 and it was subsequently demolished. Many of the original St. John's furnishings, including its bell and, at first, its altar rail, pulpit and lectern would be utilized in the new St. John's Episcopal Church (West Hartford, Connecticut) building, designed by noted architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. Notable people Prominent parishioners of the church's Hartford years included Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, who purchased a pew at St. John's in 1864Gatta, John. \\"The Anglican Aspect of Harriet Beecher Stowe\\", New England Quarterly, September, 2000, pp. 412-413 and regularly attended Sunday services with her twin daughters Hattie and Eliza.\\"The Stowes: Some of Some of Rev.

At the time, she was running Colt Firearms following her husband's recent death. Gideon Welles, President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy, was also a congregant in the years following the American Civil War. While in Hartford, St. John's had many notable clergy including Arthur Cleveland Coxe, St. John's first Rector (1842-1854), who later served as the second Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York.

Both are scheduled monuments. They are located on the edge of a small hamlet called Gorsty Knoll, just to the west of Parkend, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Historically, Darkhill was sometimes written Dark Hill. History The noted Scottish metallurgist, David Mushet, moved to the Forest of Dean in February 1810 to take up full-time management of Whitecliff Ironworks in Coleford ‚Äì although he quickly disengaged himself from the business for reasons that are not known.Man of Iron ‚Äì Man of Steel, Ralph Anstis, page 35 In 1818/19 he built a coke-fired 'experimental furnace' at Darkhill, marking the start of industrial activity on the site. Although he did produce significant quantities of iron for sale, the larger part of the works was given over to research and experimental production. In 1845 David retired to Monmouth and conveyed Darkhill to his three sons, with the youngest, Robert Mushet, becoming the manager. The sons constantly quarrelled and just six weeks after their father‚Äôs death they attempted to sell Darkhill, and other works bequeathed to them, at auction in July 1847. Either there were no takers, or as seems more likely, it was withdrawn from sale.Keith Webb, Robert Mushet and the Darkhill Ironworks, page 21-23 In September 1847 the brothers agreed to dissolve their partnership and the main furnace was probably never again in blast.Darkhill-reports Robert, now free of family ties, went into partnership with a Birmingham merchant named Thomas Deykin Clare. Trading as R Mushet & Co., they opened a 'small experimental steelworks' on the upper terrace of Darkhill in 1848, called the Forest Steel Works.Report on the Archaeological Digs at Darkhill Ironworks in the 1970s Robert produced some steel here, and some finished tools, but more importantly he made great progress in his experiments with steel alloys and it became clear that a new operation would be required to facilitate production. The alloy for which Robert held most aspiration was one using Titanium; so he named the new company The Titanic Steelworks and Iron Works Co. Ltd., known as The Titanic Steelworks.Keith Webb, Robert Mushet and the Darkhill Ironworks, page 75 It opened in October 1862, less than 250 yards from the old works of Darkhill. Three hundred men were employed there, but demand for the new alloys, and profits, did not meet expectations. Robert returned to his experiments and in 1868 he invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (R.M.S.). Very little of the Titanic Steelworks now survive. In 1870 Mushet met Samuel Osborn, a Sheffield steelmaker, who persuaded him that the future of steel production lay the rapidly expanding industrial centre of Sheffield. In 1871 the Titanic works were closed down and Mushet entered into a new agreement with Samuel Osborn. The agreement was straightforward, Osborn was given the sole right to manufacture R.M.S. and Mushet was to receive a royalty on every ton sold.tilthammer.com/Steel city founders To ensure secrecy some of the specialised processes were still carried out in the Forest of Dean, overseen by Mushet himself, while Mushet's two sons Henry and Edward moved to Sheffield to oversee its manufacture. Samuel Osborn & Company went on to become the second largest steel firm in Sheffield. The Titanic company was wound up in 1874. By the 1960s the buildings had lost their roofs and many were bulldozed ‚Äì the material being used as hardcore in the construction of the Severn Bridge.Keith Webb, Robert Mushet and the Darkhill Ironworks, page 76 Darkhill Ironworks was finally sold by the brothers in 1864, to Samuel Morgan. By 1874 it was owned by the Severn & Wye Railway & Canal Co, who used part of the site to run their new railway across. In 1981 Darkhill was sold back to the Crown.Man of Iron, Man of Steel, page 128 Significance and legacy Clinker which remains on site The first coke-fired blast furnace had been constructed in 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, but it was almost a century later before they began to make an appearance in the Forest of Dean. Despite the presence of both extensive iron-ore reserves and coal measures, Forest of Dean coal did not produce coke which was ideal for smeltingHistorical Metallurgy Society website and local ironmasters were reluctant to invest in the new technology. Around 1820, however, Moses Teague, whilst borrowing the cupola furnace at Darkhill Ironworks, discovered a way to make good iron from local coke. To exploit his discovery, he re-opened Parkend Ironworks in 1824 and Cinderford Ironworks in 1829, greatly advancing the Forest of Dean iron industry.British History OnlineRalph Anstis, Man of Iron- Man of Steel, page 58 While it could be argued that David Mushet's most important contributions to metallurgy were made prior to 1818, credit must be given to him for laying the foundations at Darkhill, both literal and metaphorical, upon which the achievements of his son Robert were built. Both men were great experimenters, with Robert carrying out over ten thousand experiments in just ten years, during his time at the Forest Steel Works.Ralph Anstis, Man of Iron ‚Äì Man of Steel, page 157 Robert took out fifty four patents on his work,Keith Webb, Robert Mushet and the Darkhill Ironworks, page 14 but a lack of income and commercial acumen meant that he was never to receive full recognition, financial or personal, for his achievements. Robert Mushet's first major contribution to metallurgy came in 1856 when perfected the Bessemer Process by discovering the solution to early quality problems which beset the process.Ralph Anstis, Man of Iron-Man of Steel, page 140 Mushet patented his method, but it was allowed to lapse. Later, Bessemer claimed to have independently stumbled across the same solution.Ralph Anstis, Man of Iron-Man of Steel, page 148 and Mushet, without a valid patent, received little credit. Whether or not the patents could have been sustained is not known, but the value of Mushet's procedure was shown by its near universal adoption in conjunction with the Bessemer Process. In 1857, steel for the first steel railway lines was made at Darkhill and rolled at the Ebbw Vale Iron Company's works. They were laid near Derby railway station, on a heavily used section of track, where the Midland Railway had been replacing the iron rails every three to five months. After ten years of use, Robert Mushet's new rails showed no sign of wear. Aware of their historic importance, Robert Mushet made repeated requests for their return once they reached the end of their usable life ‚Äì but they were scrapped in 1873. In a second key advance in metallurgy Mushet invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (R.M.S.) in 1868. It was both the first true tool steel and the first air-hardening steel.. It revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of High speed steel. Darkhill Ironworks and the Titanic Steelworks were scheduled in November 2002. Included within the scheduled area are a section of tram-road, built to serve the furnaces, and a large lump of clinker, known as 'the bear'.Gloucestershire Archaeology News, Summer 2003 The site is now preserved as an industrial archaeological site of international importance and is open to the public.

Background  Gaines played football at De La Salle High School in Concord, California and Vanden High School in Fairfield, California. In 1997-98, while at Vanden High School, Gaines was named the Northern California Offensive Player of the Year. Gaines also played baseball and was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 11th round of the Major League Baseball Draft in 1998. During his collegiate career Gaines did not have the same success he had in high school: he committed to play football under University of Southern California Head Coach John Robinson, but after Robinson was fired in the fall of 1997 he elected not to play and sat out the 1998 season. In 1999, Gaines joined the scout squad at Utah State University. Gaines played one season for the football team at San Jose State in 2001, where he graduated in 2003.  Career  In 2003, Gaines became defensive coordinator and special teams coach at James Lick High School in San Jose, California, where he inherited a program that had not won a game in three years. After one season James Lick finished with a 7-3 record in the San Jose‚Äôs Blossom Valley Athletic League. Between 2004 and 2006 Gaines worked three years as a Division 1 strength and condition coach at both the University of Louisiana-Monroe and Louisiana State University, learning the craft of weight lifting under Olympic weight lifting coach Gayle Hatch. In 2007, Gaines founded Performance Gaines in Seattle, Washington and began to train players on his own. Starting with six players including Marcus Trufant and Erik Coleman, within a few months the program grew to include 30 players, the biggest NFL off-season training program in the country. Marketing was primarily by word of mouth. Gaines has also worked with star athletes such as Reggie Bush, Chris Johnson, Brandon Roy and Bob Sanders. Personal interests American born author Ernest J. Gaines, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and many writing accolades, is the uncle of Travelle Gaines. San Francisco 49ers Travis LaBoy is the godfather of Travelle‚Äôs son and LaBoy was also a client of Gaines.

The parish's first Mass was held in the Bishop's residence on Sandusky for 126 people on December 8, 1907. Fund raising began for a combination church and school and the cornerstone for the new building was laid on March 14, 1908. The facility was dedicated on September 7 of the same year. A rectory was built from 1916-1917. Construction began on the current church building in 1925. The first Mass was celebrated in the building on August 1, 1927 and it was dedicated on September 5 of the same year. On May 10, 1947 the See City was transferred from Leavenworth, Kansas to Kansas City by Pope Pius XII. Bishop George Donnelly consecrated St. Peter's as a cathedral in 1948. Twelve gold crosses that represent the Twelve Apostles were placed between the Stations of the Cross . A portable Bishop's throne was placed in the sanctuary. A parish center was built in 1992, and the interior of the cathedral was renovated in 1998. From October 6, 2006 to October 8, 2007 the parish observed its centennial. A statue of St. Joseph the Worker was placed in the Centennial Courtyard and a time capsule, to be opened in 2057, was buried nearby. Parochial School St. Peter's School opened in the fall of 1908 with 95 elementary and 10 high school students. The combination church and school building became too small and a new structure was built in 1912. The school had 430 students by 1937. A fire destroyed the building in 1943. A new and larger building was dedicated on October 23, 1955. As the population shifted from the city to the suburbs the enrollment in the school started to decline.

Its vestiges lie in the vicinity of the resort and marina of Vilamoura, in the civil parish of Quarteira, municipality of Loul√© Municipality. History The area around Vilamoura, in which the remains of this Roman villa can be found, has been occupied with human activity for thousands of years.Cerro da Vila Museum and Archaeological Site (2011) Graves dating back to the Bronze Age were discovered in the municipality in the Cas√£o vineyard. The Romans where the first to establish a settlement of any size within the locality; during the 2nd century, the region of the Algarve fell under the domain of Rome, under the rule of Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC ‚Äì 19 August AD 14). The region was integrated into the Province of Lusitania, in reorganized into three civitas: Balsa (Luz de Tavira), Ossonoba (Faro) and Ciuitas, whose capital was either Cilpes (Silves) or more probably at Lacobriga (Lagos). Cerro da Vila was situated in the Ossonoba territory and had a port, serving the fertile lands irrigated by a dam two kilometres from the settlement. Following its construction, the villa was periodically occupied by Visigoths and Arab (Moorish) forces. A group of silos from the Moorish period, in the interior of the Roman houses, support continuous occupation after the Romans. It was included in the Programa de Valoriza√ß√£o e Divulga√ß√£o Tur√≠stica: Itiner√°rios Arqueol√≥gicos do Alentejo e Algarve (Touristic Valorization Program) in 1999, by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism, and the Secretary-of-State for Culture.

He served as the Nuncio to Great Britain from 18 December 2010, having been appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, until 6 February 2017 when Pope Francis transferred him to work in the Secretariat of State in Rome where he is responsible for relations between the Holy See and Italy. Besides his native Italian, Mennini can speak English, French, Spanish, German, Bulgarian and Russian. Biography Mennini was born in Rome, in a family that has strong links with the Holy See. His father, Luigi Mennini, who died in 1997, was managing director of the Holy See's Institute for Works of Religion (the Vatican Bank) at the time allegations of money laundering were made against Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, the Institute's sometime president. Antonio Mennini has 13 siblings, among them Pietro Mennini, who is the Procuratore della Repubblica di Chieti (\\"Public Prosecutor of Chieti\\"). Mennini was ordained to the priesthood on 14 December 1974. Mennini obtained a Doctor of Theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome. Mennini is known in Italy as the priest who heard the final confession of the country‚Äôs murdered Prime Minister, Aldo Moro, in the 1970s. Moro had been kidnapped and was being held captive in a secret location by the Red Brigades, a leftist Italian militant group. Archbishop Mennini, then an assistant priest, is believed to have delivered a letter to the terrorists from Pope Paul VI and a letter to Mr Moro from his wife. Shortly after his secret mission, the Prime Minister was killed and his body dumped in central Rome. The Vatican shielded the priest from ever having to testify in subsequent state hearings concerning Moro‚Äôs abduction and murder, until Pope Francis authorized him to do so in 2015.\\"Papal nuncio to testify about failed negotiations in 1978 kidnap-murder of former Italian premier?\\". Catholic Culture. Published: 9 March 2015.\\"Pope helps shed light on notorious Italy murder\\". UCANews. Published: 7 March 2015. Diplomatic career After obtaining the degree Doctor of Theology Mennini entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1981, serving as an attache in the Pontifical Representations in Uganda and Turkey, and then in the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. =Nuncio to Bulgaria= On 8 July 2000, Mennini was appointed Titular Archbishop of Ferentium by Pope John Paul II. Mennini received his episcopal consecration on 12 September from Cardinal Angelo Sodano, with Cardinals Camillo Ruini and Jean-Louis Tauran serving as co-consecrators. Upon Mennini's arrival in Bulgaria, he began preparing Pope John Paul II‚Äôs 2002 pastoral visit to the Eastern European country amid great controversy. However, the visit was hailed as a success, largely because the new nuncio established excellent working relations with Orthodox leaders who had originally opposed it. =Nuncio to Russia and Uzbekistan= On 6 November 2002, Mennini was named Nuncio to Russia and from 26 July 2008 was also Nuncio to Uzbekistan. He is credited with notably improving the Holy See‚Äôs relations with the former Soviet countries in the Federation and with the Russian Orthodox Church. As recently as 2001 Rome was criticised by the Russian Orthodox for establishing dioceses without adequate consultation in Russia. However, through the nuncio‚Äôs fence-mending efforts the situation gradually began to change and in December 2009 President Dmitry Medvedev approved the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the two states. On 13 February 2011 Dmitry Medvedev awarded Mennini the Order of Friendship for his contribution to the development of Russian-Vatican relations. =Nuncio to Great Britain= Mennini was named Nuncio to Great Britain on 18 December 2010 following the early retirement of Archbishop Faustino Sainz Mu√±oz on 2 December 2010. He presented his credentials to The Queen on 2 March 2011. One of the most important duties facing Mennini as Nuncio was to oversee the vetting process for the appointment of a substantial number of new bishops for England, Wales and Scotland. Most significantly, Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh and Britain's then most senior cleric, on 25 February 2013. Two days later, the Pope likewise accepted that of Patrick Altham Kelly, Archbishop of Liverpool. Mennini played a central role in the appointment of their successors. A writer in the English Catholic publication The Tablet considered it likely that Mennini's appointment was recognition that delicate diplomatic work was required for the establishment of the personal ordinariate for former Anglicans in Britain. Secretariat of State On 20 January 2017 it was announced that Mennini was to be transferred to the Variant to serve in the Secretariat of State. His tenure in Britain ended on 6 February. In his new post he is responsible for relations between the Holy See and Italy.

She sank in Lake Michigan on November 29, 1868, five miles southeast of Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States. The bottom of the ship lies under 130 feet (39.6 meters) of water. Career The windlass of the Northerner Northerner was built in 1850 in Clayton, New York, by John Oades. Her original owner was Henry T. Bacon, a New York merchant, and her co-owner and operator was Russell Disbrow. At that time, Northerner mainly operated on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. In 1859, she was damaged in a storm on Lake Ontario and was reconstructed at Wells Island, New York. In 1863, the ship was sold to interests in Chicago, Illinois. At that point, Northerner became involved in shipping lumber on Lake Michigan. On 15 September 1865, Northerner was sold to Nicholas Ronk and Nicholas Cauten of Ronksville, Wisconsin. By 7 December 1866 Ronk bought out his partner and became the Northerner‚Äôs sole owner. On 22 May 1867 a new enrollment was entered at Milwaukee that documented Anders Ryerson of Milwaukee as owning 1/3 share and Nicholas Ronk owning 2/3 of the vessel. Ryerson became her captain. In November 1868, her hull suffered damaged at Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, while she took on a cargo of timber. The ship made it to Port Washington, where temporary repairs were made. Then she was towed back to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by another ship, Cuyahoga. Northerner capsized en route to Milwaukee on November 29, 1868. Cuyahoga rescued her crew. The wreck The depth of Northerner‚Ä≤s is somewhat controversial. Some sources cite the Northerner as being under 130 feet (39.6 meters) of water, while others have stated that the depth is 135 feet (41.1 meters). The foremast has toppled but remains on the wreck. The amidships mast is no longer on or near the wreck. The ship remains fairly intact although the pilothouse tore off when the ship sank.http://www.deepsixscuba.com/schooner_northerner.html Footnotes *1) This listing of operators in most likely incomplete.

Wilkinson is an African American feminist writer from Kentucky. Early life and education Born in Hamilton, Ohio, Crystal Wilkinson was brought to her grandparents' farm in Indian Creek, Kentucky (about three miles east of Middleburg, Kentucky) when she was six weeks old. The only African American family in the area and like many farmers in Appalachia, Silas Wilkinson grew cash crops of tobacco and corn and produced sorghum molasses; and, given the few jobs available for African-American women in eastern Kentucky, Christine Wilkinson cleaned and cooked in the homes of the local schoolteachers of Casey County. Wilkinson wrote that she \\"lived an enchanted childhood\\" and that her grandparents \\"gave me the freedom to explore the countryside and to write, to dream, to discover.\\" She wrote about her childhood and her upbringing in her award-winning book, Blackberries, Blackberries: :\\"I grew up on a farm in Indian Creek, Kentucky during the seventies. I swam in creeks and roamed the knobs and hills. We had an outhouse and no inside running water. Our house was heated by coal and wood-burning stoves and we lived so far back in the woods that we could get only one television station. But it was a place of beauty - trees, green grass and blue sky as far as you could see. I am country. Being country is as much a part of me as my full lips, wide hips, dreadlocks and high cheek bones. There are many Black country folks who have lived and are living in small towns, up hollers and across knobs. They are all over the South‚Äîscattered like milk thistle seeds in the wind. The stories in this book are centered in these places.\\" Wilkinson attended Eastern Kentucky University in nearby Richmond, Kentucky and graduated with a B.A. in journalism in 1985. In 2003 she earned her Masters in Fine Arts degree (in creative writing) from Spalding University in Louisville, Kentucky.  Career  From 1989 to 1995, Wilkinson was a public information officer and community relations manager for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, editing their quarterly environmental newsletter and handling media relations for special projects. She also began volunteering her time to public service in Lexington, most notably the Roots and Heritage Festival, helping with publicity and coordinating the literary readings. During this time, Wilkinson joined other Kentucky African American writers (including Kelly Norman Ellis, Ricardo Nazario y Colon, Mitchell L. H. Douglas, and Daundra Scisney-Givens) at the Martin Luther King Jr. Cultural Center at the University of Kentucky where Frank X Walker was the assistant director. The group, later called The Affrilachian Poets, was mentored by the poet Nikky Finney who was teaching then at the University of Kentucky. In 2000, Wilkinson published her first volume, the short story collection Blackberries, Blackberries (The Toby Press, 2000), which would go on to receive the Chaffin Award for Appalachian Literature. In 1997 Wilkinson became the Assistant Director for the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learninghttp://www.carnegiecenterlex.org in Lexington, Kentucky where she taught short courses and implemented many different programs and activities for Kentucky's literary arts scene. From 1997 to 2001 and again in 2008 she taught high school juniors and seniors who were juried into the creative writing discipline for the Governor's School for the Arts (Kentucky). She also served as chair of the creative writing department from 1997 to 2001. In the spring of 2004, she served as the Writer-in-Residence for the Appalachian College Association, conducting advanced creative writing classes and one-on- one instruction for undergraduate writing students at Cumberland College, Lindsey Wilson College and Berea College. She has taught creative writing at Eastern Kentucky University (2002‚Äì2003), Indiana University-Bloomington (2004‚Äì2007), and at Morehead State University (2007‚Äì2013). At present she is Writer in Residence at Berea College. She and her partner, the artist Ronald Davis, are the founders and editors of the briefly published Mythium: A Journal of Contemporary Literature, a journal that celebrated writers of color and other cultural voices.

(1785‚Äì1850) was an Irish politician, Solicitor-General for Ireland and senior judge, who became Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. Background and education Doherty was born in Dublin, the second surviving son of John Doherty and his wife Margaret Verney. His father, an attorney, died before 1803. He was educated at Chester School and the University of Dublin, entered the King's Inns, and was called to the Bar 1808. He had a distant family connection through his father with George Canning, which was useful to him in his career. Doherty's father's mother (so grandmother) was Abigail Canning, the sister of George Canning's grandfather. Legal and judicial career Doherty was made a King's Counsel in 1823 (becoming a Queen's Counsel with the accession of Queen Victoria to the Throne in 1837). He was Member of Parliament for New Ross, Kilkenny City and Newport (Cornwall) and served as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1827 to 1830. He was a Bencher of the King's Inns. In 1830 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, in which office he remained until his death from heart disease in 1850. As a judge he was described as courteous and painstaking, but not deeply learned. As Solicitor-General he is remembered mainly for prosecuting in the 'Doneraile Conspiracy' case in 1829, and for his ferocious clashes with Daniel O'Connell, who appeared as defence counsel for several of the accused and secured their acquittals. O'Connell attacked both Doherty's tactics and his integrity, openly accusing him of conniving at the conviction of innocent men:O'Faol√°in, Sean King of the Beggars- a life of Daniel O'Connell Alan Figgis Ltd. Dublin 1970 he repeated the attacks in Parliament where Doherty successfully defended his conduct. The enmity between the two men lasted till death. Reputation  While O'Connell had a very poor opinion of Doherty (as he did of many of the Irish judges at the time, notably Thomas Lefroy), and treated his appointment as Chief Justice as a personal insult, most of his colleagues on the Bench admired Doherty's legal ability (though not a profound legal scholar he had a great knowledge of Court procedures); but they would have agreed with O'Connell that his rapid advancement was due to his reputation as a safe \\"Government man\\". However he did have certain principles: in particular he was a convinced believer in Catholic Emancipation. As a judge he lobbied repeatedly for a peerage, but without success. Personal life St. Helen's, Booterstown, where Doherty lived from 1830 Doherty married Elizabeth Lucy Wall, daughter of Charles William Wall, in 1822. They had seven children, including John, the eldest son and heir. His main residence was St. Helen's, Booterstown, which he bought in 1830, and to which he made several improvements. He also had a town house at Ely Place and a farm, called \\"Blacklion\\", in County Carlow. He died while on his annual summer holiday at Beaumaris in Anglesey. In private life he was noted as a keen coin collector and for his speculations, often unlucky, on the Stock Exchange. Due to his exceptional height he was nicknamed \\"Long Jack\\". His courtroom manner was described as \\"theatrical and pompous\\", and his consciously \\"refined\\" accent made him as easy target for parody by opponents. On the other hand his charm and sense of humour made him a popular figure in Dublin society.Geoghegan, Patrick M.

Its leaders were Christian following the baptism of Pomare II. Its progressive rise and recognition by Europeans allowed Tahiti to remain free from a planned Spanish colonization as well as English and earlier French claims to the islands. The Kingdom was one of a number of independent Polynesian states in Oceania, alongside Raiatea, Huahine, Bora Bora, Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga, Rarotonga and Niue in the 19th century. The Kingdom is known for bringing a period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity to the islands over the reign of the five Tahitian monarchs. Tahiti and its dependencies were made a French protectorate in 1842 and largely annexed as a colony of France in 1880. The monarchy was abolished by France shortly thereafter, though there are still pretenders.  History  =Beginning= P≈çmare I, founder of the P≈çmare dynasty and King of Tahiti P≈çmare I was born at Pare, ca. 1743. He was the second son of Teu Tunuieaiteatua by his wife, Tetupaia-i-Hauiri. He initially reigned under the regency of his father. He succeeded on the death of his father as Ari ªi-rahi of Porionu ªu 23 November 1802. In terms of European encroachment in the period immediately encompassing the period of Pomare I. \\"The attempt at colonization by the Spaniards in 1774 was followed by the settlement of thirty persons brought in 1797 by the missionary ship Duff. Though befriended by Pomare I (who lived until 1805), they had many difficulties, especially from the constant wars, and at length they fled with Pomare II to Eimeo and ultimately to New South Wales. They returned in 1812 when Pomare renounced heathenism.\\" Pomare was the Tahitian chieftain most friendly to the British. The additional British captains arriving at Tahiti accepted his claim to hegemony. They gave him guns in trade and helped him in his battles. Captain Cook gave him the advantage in a number of battles with rival forces during his last stay in Tahiti, circa 1779. British missionaries arrived, sent by a non-denominational Protestant group called the London Missionary Society. Pomare befriended the missionaries, and the missionaries favored both peace and Pomare, but, with the British unwilling to apply force to create order among the islands, the missionaries were unable to stop the warring. As king, P≈çmare I succeeded in uniting the different chiefdoms of Tahiti into a single kingdom, composed of the islands of Tahiti itself, Mo ªorea, Meheti ªa, and the Teti ªaroa group. His service as the first king of unified Tahiti ended when he abdicated in 1791, but he remained the regent of Tahiti from 1791 until 1803. He married four times and had two sons and three daughters. By now, islanders were passing to each other diseases that had arrived with the Europeans: diseases for which they had undeveloped immunities. Many islanders were dying. In 1803, Pomare died. His son, Otu, became head of the family, with the title Pomare II. T≈´ T≈´nui ªƒì ªaiteatua P≈çmare II reigned 1803‚Äì1821. The missionaries remained allied with the Pomare family. Despite their pacifism, they wanted to see Pomare II successful in uniting the islanders under his rule. =Consolidation= Pomare II King Pomare II P≈çmare II, King of Tahiti (1774 ‚Äì 7 December 1821) was the second king of Tahiti between 1782 and 1821. He was installed by his father P≈çmare I at Tarahoi, 13 February 1791. He ruled under regency from 1782 to 1803. Initially recognised as supreme sovereign and Ari ªi-maro- ªura by the ruler of Huahine, he was subsequently forced to take refuge in Mo ªorea 22 December 1808, but returned and defeated his enemies at the Battle of Te Feipƒ´. He was thereafter recognized as undisputed King of Tahiti, Mo ªorea and its dependencies. Other chieftains on Tahiti became fed up with what they saw as Pomare's pretensions of power, and in 1808 they drove him from Tahiti to the nearby island of Eimeo (Moorea). These other chieftains hostile towards the missionaries, which caused the missionaries to leave Tahiti for other islands. William Ellis Pomare organized military support from his kinsmen on the islands of Raiatea, Bora Bora and Huahine. Warring resumed, with Pomare winning the decisive Battle of Te Fe‚Äôi Pƒ´, on 12 November 1815. His victory was a victory also for the Christians. And, in victory Pomare surprised the Tahitians. He pardoned all who laid down their weapons. When defeated warriors returned from the hills, they found their homes had not been set afire and that their wives and children had not been slaughtered. The warfare culture of the islanders had been changed by the influence that the missionaries had on Pomare II. Centralized authority among chiefs was not traditional in Tahiti, but the missionaries welcomed Pomare's new power. Distress from disease, civil war and death won for them serious attention to their teachings. They launched a campaign to teach the islanders to read, so they could read scripture. There were mass conversions in hope of the supernatural protections that Christianity offered. The missionaries told the islanders how to dress. The climate was suitable to exposing the skin to the greater cool of open air, but for the missionaries cool was no consideration. Little clothing for them was indecent exposure. Another lifestyle promoted by the missionaries was manufacturing, the missionaries setting up a sugar refinery and a textile factory. In 1817, Tahiti acquired its first printing press, and, in 1819, cotton, sugar and coffee crops were planted. Pomare II asked the missionaries for advice on laws, and the missionaries, being monarchists and wanting Pomare to be a proper monarch, advised him that the laws would have to be his, not theirs. They did make suggestions, however, and in September 1819, Pomare produced Tahiti's first written law. There was protection of life and property, observance of Sabbath, a sanctification of marriage and a judiciary to maintain the laws. P≈çmare was married to Queen Tetua-nui Taro-vahine. He was baptised 16 May 1819 at the Royal Chapel, Pape ªete. Three London Missionary Society missionaries, Henry Bicknell, William Henry, and Charles Wilson preached at the baptism of King Pomare II. Pomare died of drink-related causes at Motu Uta, Papeete, 7 December 1821. Pomare II died in 1824 at the age of forty-two, leaving behind an eight-year-old daughter and a five-year- old son. The son, Teri ªi-ta-ria and P≈çmare III, ruled in name from 1821 to 1827 while being educated by the missionaries. He died in 1827 of an unknown disease, and the daughter, then eleven, became Queen P≈çmare IV. Pomare III P≈çmare III was the king of Tahiti between 1821 and 1827. He was the second son of P≈çmare II. He was born at Papa ªoa,  ªArue, 25 June 1820 as Teri'i-ta-ria, and was baptised on 10 September 1820. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. He was crowned at Papa ªoa,  ªArue, 21 April 1824. Pomare III's education took place at the South Sea Academy, Papetoai, Mo ªorea. He reigned under a council of Regency until his death 8 January 1827. During his reign, the Kingdom's first flag was adopted. He was succeeded by his sister,  ªAimata P≈çmare IV Vahine-o-Punuatera ªitua, who reigned 1827‚Äì1877. =P≈çmare IV= Queen P≈çmare IV P≈çmare IV, Queen of Tahiti (28 February 1813 ‚Äì 17 September 1877), more properly  ªAimata P≈çmare IV Vahine-o-Punuatera ªitua (otherwise known as  ªAimata {meaning: eye-eater, after an old custom of the ruler to eat the eye of the defeated foe} or simply as P≈çmare IV), was the queen of Tahiti between 1827 and 1877. She was the daughter of P≈çmare II. She succeeded as ruler of Tahiti after the death of her brother P≈çmare III when she was only 14 years old. She succeeded in reuniting Raiatea and Porapora (Borabora) with the kingdom of Tahiti. She hosted numerous Britons, including a Charles Darwin. Return of the Pitcairn Islanders By 1829, of those who had arrived at Pitcairn on HMS Bounty in 1790, only seven remained, but with their offspring they numbered 86. The supply of timber on Pitcairn was decreasing and the availability of water was erratic. Since the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Pitcairn islanders had been discovered by and had friendly contact with the Royal Navy and British authorities. In 1830, Tahiti's Queen Pomare IV invited the Pitcairners to return to Tahiti, and in March 1831, a British ship transported them there. The Tahitians welcomed the Pitcairners and offered them land. But having been isolated and not having developed any immunity to the diseases now on Tahiti, the Pitcairners suffered from disease in alarming number. Fourteen of them died. The Tahitians took up a collection for the surviving Pitcairners, and for $500 a whaling captain took them back to Pitcairn. French Protectorate Abel Aubert du Petit- Thouars Flag (1843‚Äì1880) Proclamation ceremony for the Protectorate in 1842 In 1842, a European crisis involving Morocco escalated between France and Great Britain when Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, acting independently of the French government, convinced Tahiti's Queen Pomare IV to accept a French protectorate. George Pritchard, a Birmingham-born missionary and acting British Consul, had been away at the time. However he returned to work towards indoctrinating the locals against the Roman Catholic French. In November 1843, Dupetit-Thouars (again on his own initiative) landed sailors on the island, annexing it to France. He then threw Pritchard into prison, subsequently sending him back to Britain. During this time, Thouars managed to convince Pomare IV to sign to putting her country under the protection of France, although he was not empowered to do so, nor was he ever sanctioned in this regard. News of Tahiti reached Europe in early 1844. The French statesman Fran√ßois Guizot, supported by King Louis-Philippe of France, had denounced annexation of the island, and the treaty was never ratified by France. However, the French did have an interest in the region, and the treaty was enforced from its signing by various factions. The Franco-Tahitian War between the Tahitians and French went from 1843 to 1847. Pomare IV ruled under French administration from 1843 until 1877. While the Dynasty retained their title for some time, they lost outright control of their country. Death of Pomare IV Pomare IV died from natural causes in 1877. She is buried in the Royal Mausoleum, Papaoa, Arue. She was succeeded by P≈çmare V, who reigned 1877‚Äì1880. =Pomare V and forced abdication= P≈çmare V, the last King of Tahiti (1877‚Äì1880) P≈çmare V, King of Tahiti (3 November 1839 ‚Äì 12 June 1891) was the last king of Tahiti, reigning from 1877 until his forced abdication in 1880. He was the son of Queen P≈çmare IV. He was born as Teri'i Tari'a Te-rƒÅ- tane and became Heir Apparent and Crown Prince (Ari'i-aue) upon the death of his elder brother on 13 May 1855. He became king of Tahiti on the death of his mother on 17 September 1877. His coronation was on 24 September 1877 at Pape'ete. He married twice, first on 11 November 1857 to Te-mƒÅ-ri'i-Ma'i-hara Te-uhe-a-Te-uru-ra'i, princess of Huahine. He divorced her on 5 August 1861. His second marriage was to Joanna Mara'u-Ta'aroa Te-pa'u Salmon (thereafter known as Her Majesty The Queen Marau of Tahiti), at Pape'ete on 28 January 1875. He divorced her on 25 January 1888. Pomare V had one son and two daughters. The island of Tahiti and most of its satellites remained a French protectorate until the late 19th century, when King Pomare V (1842‚Äì1891) was forced to cede the sovereignty of Tahiti and its dependencies to France. On 29 June 1880, he gave Tahiti and its dependencies to France, whereupon he was given a pension by French government and the titular position of Officer of the Orders of the Legion of Honour and Agricultural Merit of France, on 9 November 1880. Tomb of the King, Utu'ai'ai, 'Arue. He died from alcoholism at the Royal Palace, Pape'ete, and is buried at the Tomb of the King, Utu'ai'ai in 'Arue.  Impact  The Dynasty left an indelible mark on Tahitian and surrounding cultures. At their height of power, the Pomares' managed to rule effectively from their base in Tahiti and Mo'orea a kingdom of islands spread over 3 million km2 of sea and had diplomatic relations and influences from the Cook Islands to Rapa Nui. They experienced, and were indeed a part and product of the European Age of Exploration in the Pacific. They produced an unprecedented period of cultural ascendancy in Tahiti, and saw their people through a period of change, and foreign intervention. They both preserved traditions and independence for a time, while also serving as a conduit for suppression of culture and resigned to French demands, facilitating the subsequent colonization of Tahiti.  Monarchs of Tahiti (1791‚Äì1880)   Current status  As of February 2009, Tauatomo Mairau claimed to be the heir to the Tahitian throne, and attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court. His claims were not recognised by France. In 2010, he became pretender to the throne and claimed the title Prince Marau of Tahiti. He was working to have royal trust lands returned to him and his family. The French government mortgaged the land after World War II, and in doing so violated the terms of the agreement signed with Pomare V in 1880 which reserved control of the trust lands for the royal family of Tahiti. The banks may be in the process of freezing the assets, and Mairau sued to prevent native Tahitians from being evicted from his trust lands, and wished for them to retain their usage rights over the land. He died in May 2013. On 28 May 2009, Joinville Pomare, an adopted member of the Pomare family, declared himself King Pomare XI, during a ceremony attended by descendants of leading chiefs but spurned by members of his own family. Other members of the family recognise his uncle, L√©opold Pomare, as heir to the throne.\\"Joinville Pomare s'est fait introniser roi Pomare XI\\", Tahiti Presse, 28 May 2009\\"Joinville, l‚Äôhomme qui voulait √™tre roi‚Ä¶ \\" , La D√©p√®che de Tahiti, 29 May 2009  Notable Tahitians  = Royalty and chieftains = * P≈çmare I, King of Tahiti. * P≈çmare II, King of Tahiti. * Teri ªito ªoterai Teremoemoe, Queen-Regent of Tahiti. * Teri ªitaria Ari ªipaeavahine, Queen-Regent of Tahiti, Queen regnant of Huahine. * P≈çmare III, King of Tahiti. * P≈çmare IV, Queen regnant of Tahiti. * Ari ªifa ªaite, Prince consort of Tahiti. * P≈çmare V, King of Tahiti. * Marau Salmon, Queen consort of Tahiti. * Tamatoa V, Prince of Tahiti, later King of Raiatea. * Teri ªiourumaona, Princess of Tahiti and Raiatea, designated heir as P≈çmare VI. * Teri ªivaetua, Princess of Tahiti and Raiatea, heiress presumptive of her uncle. * Teri ªimaevarua III, Princess of Tahiti and Raiatea, later Queen of Bora Bora. * Teri ªitapunui P≈çmare, Prince of Tahiti. * Teri ªitua Tuavira P≈çmare, Prince of Tahiti. * Hinoi P≈çmare, Prince of Tahiti. * Tati the Great, head chieftain of the Teva clan of Pare district, counselor to P≈çmare III and P≈çmare IV. * Ari ªitaimai, head chiefess of the Teva clan of Pare district. * Titaua Salmon Brander, daughter of Ari ªitaimai. * Moetia Salmon Atwater, daughter of Ari ªitaimai. * Tute Tehuiari ªi, Tahitian chief and missionary. * Mauli Tehuiari ªi, Tahitian chiefess who married into Hawaiian nobility. * Manaiula Tehuiari ªi Sumner, Tahitian chiefess who married into Hawaiian nobility. * Ninito Teraiapo Sumner, Tahitian chiefess who married into Hawaiian nobility. =Others= * William Ellis, missionary. * George Pritchard, missionary. * Alexander Salmon, Sr., Secretary of P≈çmare IV, father of Queen Marau. * Alexander Ariipaea Salmon, Jr., Businessman and adventurer, brother of Queen Marau.

The goal of this research project is to model the kinematic properties of a human hand so that better anthropomorphic robotic grippers or manipulators can be developed. The name, Kanguera, is an ancient indigenous word for \\"bones outside the body\\". Objectives According to the university's project page, some of the objectives of the Kanguera project are to develop strategies for dexterous robotic manipulation and to create new designs for robotic hands which are biologically inspired. These new designs and strategies will be used for user friendly human machine interface and for upper limb rehabilitation technologies. System Description The hand has an anthropomorphic shape, and is the size of a large human hand. It has 4 fingers, and a simplified thumb, each one with four degrees of freedom (DOF). Each finger is treated as an individual robot, giving the overall system, from the wrist on, 20 DOF in total. The fingers are constructed from a special resin, and the joints are designed to mimic human joints - they are not physically joined, but in close contact, using the resin's friction and cables to work together. The motion of each DOF driven through a servo, and a cable transmission system. This transmission system is more accurate than the ones uses by previous robotic hands, and is thus more suitable for the implementation of complex trajectory algorithms, such as adduction and abduction capacity for both the fingers and the thumb. The computational hardware is based on a GE FANUC microcontroller with a G4 processor, mounted on a standard compact PCI bus. The operating system used to run the simulations is VxWorks 6.7, and the simulation environment is handled with GraspIt! software, where a model of the hand was developed in order to visualize it. Development The hand was developed by the Mechatronics Laboratory at the School of Engineering of S√£o Carlos, University of S√£o Paulo as a successor to the Like its predecessor, the BRAHMA hand. It is now in its 4th generation. It utilizes Hardware-in-the-loop simulation techniques to reduce the development times.

Retrieved: 15 August 2011. In 1982, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture and role in Knoxville's transportation history. The L&N; completed a rail line running from Cincinnati to Atlanta in the early 1900s, and built a string of passenger stations and depots to service trains along this line. The company's Knoxville station was the city's largest, and considered by some the \\"finest\\" along the L&N;'s entire Cincinnati-Atlanta line. It served as a passenger station until the L&N; ceased passenger train service to Knoxville in 1968, and continued to house L&N; offices until 1975. The L&N; Station is mentioned in several scenes in author James Agee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, A Death in the Family.James Agee, A Death in the Family (New York: McDowell, Obolensky, 1957), pp. 17, 41, 218-219. The L&N; Station is now home to the L&N; STEM Academy, a magnet high school which focuses on science, technology, engineering, and math. Design The L&N; Station occupies the southwest corner of the intersection of Western Avenue, Broadway, Henley Street, and Summit Hill Drive, opposite Old City Hall. It straddles the east bank of Second Creek, and was designed to incorporate the bank's downward slope. The building is L-shaped, with wings projecting west and south of the northeast corner tower (the wings face Western Avenue and Henley Street). Due to the ground's slope, the building's main floor is at ground level on the north and east sides, but rises a full story above the ground on the south and west sides. Tracks and train sheds originally extended from the rail yard up to the rear of the building.Thompson Brothers (photographers), L&N; Station, Calvin M. McClung Historical Collection. Retrieved: 30 December 2010. The station's rear veranda The building's most recognizable feature is its northeast corner tower, which rises three stories, and is topped by a pitched, clay-tiled roof with decorated dormers. A smaller tower rises at the end of the west wing, giving the building its chateau-like appearance. A wrap-around veranda allows access to the main floor on the south side of the building. The north side of the west wing originally included frosted glass doors and glazed transoms, which have been restored. Due to the construction of the Western Avenue Viaduct, the building's ground level lies about below Western Avenue, with a ramp providing vehicular access. The interior of the main floor consisted of waiting rooms in the west wing, a dining room in the northeast corner tower, and a kitchen, lunch counter, and baggage areas in the south wing. The waiting rooms included a general waiting room, a ladies' waiting room (with a private entrance and an entrance from the general waiting room) on the northwest corner, and a \\"colored\\" waiting room on the southwest corner. The colored waiting room, a relic of segregation, had a separate entrance. The second story consisted of L&N; offices, and the third story in the northeast tower was used as a drafting room by L&N; engineers. History While railroads had reached Knoxville by 1855, the L&N; did not have direct access to the city until the early 1900s, due to its rivalry with the Southern Railway and its predecessors.Lucile Deaderick, ed., Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, TN: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 199-202. The Southern controlled much of the rail traffic south of the Tennessee-Kentucky border, while the L&N; controlled much of the traffic north of the border, and the two railroads continuously thwarted one another's attempts to expand beyond this border. In an 1894 meeting, L&N; president Milton Smith and Southern president Samuel Spencer agreed not to encroach upon each other's market. Stained glass windows at the station's northwest entrance Shortly after the 1894 agreement, Spencer was named president of the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway, essentially giving the Southern (of which Spencer remained president) access to the L&N;'s Kentucky and Ohio markets. Deeming the agreement void, the L&N; made plans to build a direct line from Cincinnati to Atlanta by way of Knoxville. In 1902, the L&N; purchased the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad, which connected Knoxville to the Western and Atlantic at Marietta, Georgia, and began construction of a line from Jellico to Knoxville, which was completed in 1905. The L&N; planned an elegant Knoxville station to rival the Southern Terminal, which had been erected at the Southern railyard along Depot Street. The L&N; completed a freight depot in 1904, and began construction of the passenger station that same year. The station was designed by the L&N; Engineering Department, headed by Irish immigrant and Royal College of Science for Ireland graduate Richard Monfort, who was largely responsible for the station's Victorian and chateauesque elements. The station formally opened on April 10, 1905. Author James Agee describes the L&N; Station in several scenes in his book, A Death In the Family, which is set in Knoxville in 1915. In an early scene, while walking through Knoxville with his father, they pass the station, and Agee noted how its stained glass \\"smouldered like an exhausted butterfly.\\" In another scene, while crossing the Asylum (Western) Avenue Viaduct, he wrote, \\"the L&N; yards lay on his left, feint skeins of steel, blocked shadows, little spumes of steam.\\" In a later scene, Agee describes the crowded L&N; waiting room, in which his family waited to catch a train to the Great Smoky Mountains. =Named passenger trains serving the station= Several passenger trains made stops at the station, including the following: *Flamingo - Cincinnati - Jacksonville, Florida *Southland - a pooled train from Chicago, through Cincinnati to St. Petersburg, Florida, a joint operation of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the L&N;, Central of Georgia and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.Peter Maiken, Night Trains: The Pullman Systems in the Golden Years of American Rail Travel, (1992) p. 126Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, January, 1954, Table C http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR54-1TT.pdf =Post-L&N; development= The L&N; gradually phased out passenger service after World War II, with the last passenger train, the Flamingo, leaving the L&N; Station in 1968. The L&N; vacated the station in 1975, after which it remained vacant until purchased by Alex Harkness and his partners in 1980. In 1982, the station was renovated for use in the 1982 World's Fair, as it was adjacent to the World's Fair Park, which was then under development. Two restaurants, a Ruby Tuesday restaurant and the first L&N; Seafood Grill, were housed in lower floors of the building, while the second floor offices were converted into meeting rooms for the fair's VIPs.Samuel (Sandy) E.

Funding for the STEM school is included in the Tennessee Race to the Top plan. $2 million was provided to the school through the Race to the Top funding. The idea for the L&N; STEM Academy began with the district's strategic plan from 2009 that aimed for a \\"high quality, stand- alone technology high school.\\" While applying for the Race to the Top funding, two plans for the L&N; STEM Academy were merged; plans for a school to focus on science, math, and engineering and a plan for a STEM platform school were merged. To receive the funding from Race to the Top, the school had to meet the following requirements: \\"enrollment has to be open for any students who show the motivation to study in that environment and sharpen their skills, the school must be willing to try new things and officials must share with their neighbors their successes and failures.\\" L&N; STEM Academy's crest, refined in 2017 by student Austin Bradley In January 2011, Becky Ashe was appointed principal of the school and also the coordinator of STEM education for Knox County Schools. At the same time, the L&N; station was officially chosen as the site for the school. The new school officially opened on August 15, 2011 with an enrollment of 180 students. The school began with just a freshman class, a sophomore class, 8 full-time teachers, and 4 part-time teachers. It cost $5.6 million to open the school with the money being used for renovations of the building, upgrades, and technology equipment. Students were still required to meet the academic standards presented by Knox County Schools but the material was delivered through the use of iPads, block scheduling, and cross planning through departments. Students were also required to take a STEM class, which is a project based learning course. The school partners with over 215 business and organizations. The community was asked to help give the school its permanent name. The community gave suggestions to the school board who finalized the name. Over 95 suggestions were given by the community. In October 2011, the students and faculty of the school selected a gryphon to be the school mascot. Gryphons can be seen in the stained glass windows at the school. The L&N; STEM Academy partnered with the YMCA for the physical education program at the school. The students are able to work out at the YMCA's downtown Knoxville location during their PE class. The students walk over to the YMCA, do a homework assignment, and then are able to work out at the YMCA facilities during the remainder of time for class. In December 2011, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam visited the school and talked with six students and two teachers. The Haslam family provided many contributions to the school and a space, the Haslam Commons, in the school was named after the family. At the end of its first year of operation, the school ranked first and second in state tests for Algebra 1 and 2 and English 1 and 2. In the second year of operation, 187 students were added to the rosters: 150 freshmen, twenty sophomores, and six juniors. Eight teachers were added to the staff to bring the total to 20 teachers. Six students returned to their zoned high school. In late 2012, the L&N; STEM Academy began to allow students from eight surrounding counties to apply to attend the school. Thirty students were admitted to the school from the eight counties of Anderson, Blount, Grainger, Jefferson, Loudon, Roane, Sevier and Union for the 2013-2014 school year. The only restriction to the students who apply from out of county are that they have to be incoming freshmen and be interested in problem solving and critical thinking. In 2013, the school was recognized as an Apple Distinguished school for the 2012-2013 school year. It was given the award for the school's \\"successes in enhancing and extending teaching and learning with the implementation of technology.\\" For AP test scores, students scored in the top percentile for scoring threes or above. The school is also at the top of Knox County Schools in proficient and advanced scores in English classes 1, 2, and 3. In September 2013, former L&N; STEM Academy student Jessica Rainwater alleged that the school helped her cheat to allow her to gain credit for a course she was taking. She alleges that \\"she was given her three prior tests to use while taking a history 'End of Course' test a fourth time.\\" Knox County School officials say that she did not cheat because that was standard procedure at the time she was taking the class. It was a county created test, not a state end of course exam, and it did not count towards her final grade. A group of students won a national contest presented by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education that allowed them to send a science experiment into space. They had to design a project that was related to microgravity and used multi-chambered tubes. The students wanted to find \\"an economically friendly way of trying to get rid of bodily wastes in space rather than bringing them back home.\\" The experiment was used to see how cornstarch reacts with RID-X. The students spent 60 hours working on the experiment. The experiment was scheduled to launch on October 21, 2014 in Wallops Island, Virginia. Due to a boat being within 20 miles of the launch site on October 21, the launch was postponed until the next day. The rocket exploded 15 seconds after takeoff. The experiment was relaunched on a second rocket on December 9, 2014 from Cape Canaveral. NanoRacks was able to find the necessary $21,500 to rebuild the experiment for the second takeoff. In May 2014, the school graduated its first class. Forty-two students were the total number of the first graduating class for the school. In August 2014, The L&N; STEM Academy was placed on the Reward schools list for Tennessee by the state Department of Education. The L&N; was placed in the top 5% and recognized for its performance. In May 2015, the first class, made up of just over 100 students, to attend the school all four years of its existence graduated. The class was awarded $3.1 million in scholarship money in total and which averaged to around $31,000 per student. In August 2015, a University of Tennessee at Knoxville student broke into the school and fell from a third floor window, about 40 ft from the ground. He had non-life-threatening injuries and was believed to be drunk at the time.

He was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1914, Attorney-General for Ireland in 1917, and a judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Ireland in 1918. After his enforced retirement in 1924, he practised at the English bar until 1929, when he returned to Ireland and was readmitted to practice as a solicitor, a controversial move necessitating a leading judgment on the standard of professional conduct to be expected of a former judge.Hogan 1988 p.144 fn(4) Biography James O'Connor was born in Wexford, the third son of Michael O'Connor, the senior partner in a long- established solicitors' firm, and was educated at Blackrock College. He married Mary Keogh in 1897. He practised as a solicitor for a few years before being called to the Irish bar in 1900; he became King's Counsel in 1908. In 1911 he published a treatise on the powers and duties of justices of the peace in Ireland. (second edition 1915 ) On 20 May 1909 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, but withdrew a few years later without being called to the English bar.Sturgess 1949 Vol.2 p.778 A Liberal Unionist and a Catholic, within a few years he had built up a large practice, and he rose in his profession with remarkable speed: he was appointed Solicitor-General at 42, Attorney General at 45, and at 46 briefly a judge of the Chancery division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland and then a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal in Ireland at 46. In January 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, O'Connor met informally in London with Irish Unionist leader Edward Carson and Sinn F√©in activist Fr Michael O'Flanagan to discuss a peaceful solution to the conflict, but without success. In 1922 he was appointed by the Provisional Government to the commission examining Irish railways. His judicial career was cut short by the Courts of Justice Act 1924, which abolished the High Court and Court of Appeal established in 1877, only two of whose judges were appointed to the Irish Free State's new High Court and Supreme Court. The judges forced into retirement received generous compensation, and O'Connor was one of many who moved to England. He was knighted in the 1925 New Year Honours. The same year, he published a two- volume history of Ireland since the 1798 rebellion, rejoined the Middle Temple on 23 April, and was called to the English bar on 6 May.Sturgess 1949 Vol.3 p.885 The Cambridge Law Journal published his address, \\"Thoughts about the Common Law\\", in 1928. Serious ill health compelled him to give up practice. He returned to Ireland, where his health improved, at least in the short term, and his doctors advised him that return to legal practice would be beneficial to his health. In re O'Connor's Application O'Connor is best remembered today for the ruling on his application for re-admission to practice as a solicitor, in which the Chief Justice held that while the application would be granted, as a general rule for a senior judge to return to legal practice was contrary to public policy. The case began badly when O'Connor filed an 8-line affidavit which, remarkably, did not refer to his career as a judge at all. The Chief Justice, Hugh Kennedy, made clear his disapproval of this conduct, required a further detailed affidavit and asked for the attendance of the Attorney General. The Attorney General's view was that \\"such a practice would open an avenue to corruption\\". The tenor of Kennedy's judgment suggests that he agreed with the Attorney General. He noted that, although some senior English judges like Francis Pemberton had returned to practice at the bar, none had done so since the Act of Settlement 1701, which in his view reflected the understanding that appointment to the Bench means that \\"the practice of law is abandoned forever\\" because \\"if a man should step down from the privileged position of the Bench and throw off what is a sacred office to engage in the rough-and tumble of litigious contest ‚Ä¶ he will shake the authority of the judicial limb of Government, and mar the prestige of the Courts of Justice upon which the whole structure of the State must always lean. Moreover, a new way of scandal and corruption would be opened up.\\"[1930] I.R. 623 at 632 However, Kennedy found that special circumstances existed: notably that O'Connor had not wished to return to practice but had been forcibly retired from the Bench, and it was on medical advice that he was seeking an active profession. Kennedy was careful to state that he was certain that O'Connor had no improper motive; he granted the application on condition that O'Connor did not seek to appear in court. Death and reputation O'Connor rejoined the family firm, but the recovery in his health was short- lived and he died in 1931 aged 59. Gerard Hogan suggests that both Kennedy's judgment in the case and his diary reveal his low personal and professional opinion of O'Connor.Hogan 1988 p.153 It is true that Kennedy had an extremely poor opinion of the pre-Independence judges as a whole, recommended their removal from the Bench , and did not suggest O'Connor as one of the very few exceptions. On the other hand, he spelt out clearly that O'Connor was free from any suggestion of corruption and, according to one report, stated that his \\"returning to the fold\\" would be a great honour to the legal profession.[1929] 63 ILTSJ 299; cited in Hogan 1988 p.146 Maurice Healy described O'Connor as a man of great ability, but with no respect for the traditions of the Irish bar: in Healy's view he was a failure as a Law Officer, but a good High Court judge and an even better appeal court judge.

Even before the death of an-Nasir in 934, three of his sons quarreled bitterly among themselves. Although the Zaidi imamship was not strictly hereditary but depended on personal qualifications and descent from Muhammad, succession tended to take place within particular families descended from al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) and his grandson al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya (d. 911).

None of them is recognized as a right imam in later Zaidi chronicles. Their younger brother al-Mansur Yahya is, on the other hand, counted as imam from 934 to his death in 976. The internal dissension among the Zaydiyyah was accentuated by the behaviour of the tribal groups of the northern Yemeni highlands, which supported one side or the other according to their interests.

Although the letters sparked considerable outrage, evoking condemnation from prominent Israeli and American Jews and others, a poll showed that 44 per cent of Israeli society supported the letters' messages.  Letters = Rabbis' letter = The rabbis' letter was a psak din (religious ruling) signed by an estimated 50 rabbis, that urged Israeli landowners not to rent apartments to Arabs, or any other non-Jews. The letter was initiated by the chief rabbi of Safed, Shmuel Eliyahu. On January 2, 2011, Eliyahu was summoned to an Israeli police interrogation on suspicion of incitement to racism, which is a crime in Israel, but he refused to answer the summons. Many of the rabbis who signed the letter were municipal rabbis, state employees in charge of religious services, who receive salaries paid for by the taxpayer. Among the signers were rabbis from Rishon LeZion, Ramat HaSharon, Herzliya, Kfar Saba and Holon (suburbs of Tel Aviv); from Jerusalem; and from other towns and settlements. According to a poll conducted by the Harry S. Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a narrow plurality of Jewish Israelis were opposed to the rabbis' call not to rent to Arabs: 48 percent opposed the statement, and 44 percent supported it.Levinson, Chaim. (2010-11-19) \\"Rabbis' wives urge Israeli women: Stay away from Arab men\\" Haaretz. Retrieved on 2011-01-06. = Rebbetzins' letter = The second letter was released on December 28, 2010, by the Lehava organization. It was signed by at least 27 rebbetzins (rabbis' wives). It urged young Jewish women to not date Arabs, and to not work at locations where non-Jews might be present. Response =Opposition=  Politicians and activists  * Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, and leader of the Likud party: On December 7, 2010, Netanyahu condemned the letter in a speech before the International Bible Contest for adults in Jerusalem. He stated: \\"How would we feel if we were told not to sell an apartment to Jews? We would protest, and we protest now when it is said of our neighbors\\"; and: \\"Such things cannot be said - not about Jews, and not about Arabs. They cannot be said in any democratic country, and especially not in a Jewish and democratic one. The state of Israel rejects these sayings.\\" * Ehud Barak, Deputy Prime Minister, Defense Minister, and leader of the Labor party: Barak stated that, \\"The rabbis' letters is part of a racist tidal wave threatening to sweep Israeli society into dark and dangerous zones. The Labor Party under my authority is working to draw all of Israel's citizens together, in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence.\\" * Reuven Rivlin, Knesset Speaker (Likud): Rivlin said to Haaretz in an interview that, \\"In my opinion, their statement shames the Jewish people... I see this general statement as an embarrassment to the Jewish people, and another nail in the coffin of Israeli democracy. Let me make this absolutely clear: I believe these people do the most damage to the state of Israel.\\" He continued: \\"Israel can justify its faith in itself as a Jewish state only if it wields its democratic powers totally and unreservedly. This moral right will be taken from us if we prove to the world that, when it comes to democracy, we deny anything which does not suit us from a Jewish point of view.\\" He also urged the attorney general to determine whether the letter constitutes the crime of incitement. * Avishay Braverman, Minorities Affairs Minister: Braverman had called for Eliyahu's ouster as early as November 18, 2010. On December 12, 2010, Braverman threatened to push for his party, Labor, to quit the coalition, stating that, \\"There is a hatred of foreigners. The nation is turning into Iran following the rabbis' letter.\\" * The Association for Civil Rights in Israel demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemn the letter (which he later did), and take disciplinary action against state-employed signatories of the letter, saying in a statement that \\"Rabbis who are civil servants have an obligation to the entire public, including Israel's Arab citizens. It is unthinkable that they would use their public status to promote racism and incitement.\\" Religious organizations * Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, dean of Yeshivat Har Etzion, and a major Religious Zionist rabbinical figure: Lichtenstein wrote a lengthy and erudite letter of opposition. * Rabbis Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Aharon Leib Shteinman, the leading Ashkenazic Haredi rabbis in Israel: Eliashiv and Steinman strongly condemned the edict. * U.S. rabbis: Numerous American rabbis also condemned the letter. An online petition for rabbis posted by the New Israel Fund on December 10, 2010, had nearly 1000 rabbis as signatories by December 16. The petition stated that \\"Am Yisrael (The Jewish People) know(s) the sting of discrimination, and we still bear the scars of hatred. When those who represent the official rabbinic leadership of the State of Israel express such positions, we are distressed by this Chillul HaShem (desecration of God's name)....Statements like these do great damage to our efforts to encourage people to love and support Israel. They communicate to our congregants that Israel does not share their values, and they promote feelings of alienation and distancing.\\" Notable American rabbis who signed the petition included Conservative Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, executive vice president of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly; Reform Rabbi David Saperstein, the director of the Religious Action Center of the Union for Reform Judaism); and Orthodox Rabbis Avi Weiss, the leader of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, and Marc Angel. Signatories included members of all major American Jewish denominations. A separate condemnation was issued by the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America. * Israeli Masorti rabbis: Roughly 50 Masorti rabbis signed a counter-letter allowing Jews to rent to non-Jews, while 40 female Israeli Reform rabbis representing the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism issued a counter-letter proclaiming \\"professional and social contacts\\" between Jews and non-Jews to be positive, and that \\"Jews who are confident in their Jewish identity do not have to fear contact with people from other nations,\\" a statement also supported by the council's 50 male Reform rabbis The Reform rabbis also argued that the rebbetzins' attitude toward Israeli girls was \\"condescending\\", portrayed them as \\"weak\\", and perpetuated male chauvinism. Their counter-letter encouraged Israelis not to listen to \\"hate-mongers and fanatics\\".  Others  * A response letter was directed to the Israeli government by various Israeli academicians and artisans, criticizing the lax approach by the government to racial and religious incitement by rabbis, and calling for the prosecution of the original letter's signatories for incitement to racism. Among the signatories to the response letter were former politician Shulamit Aloni, author Yoram Kaniuk, sculptor Dani Karavan, and politicians Zehava Gal-On and Naomi Hazan. *Holocaust survivors condemned the letter. Noah Flug, the chairman of the International Association of Holocaust Survivors, stated that, \\"As someone who suffered as a Jew and underwent the Holocaust, I remember the Nazis throwing Jews out of their apartments and city centres in order to create ghettos. I remember how they wrote on benches that no Jews were allowed, and, of course, it was prohibited to sell or rent to Jews. We thought that in our country, this wouldn't happen.\\" * Public opinion: When a poll was conducted of Jewish Israelis' reaction to the letters denouncing those who rent or sell homes to non-Jews, 48 per cent of Israeli Jews opposed the rabbis' call, while 44 per cent supported it. = Support = *Eliyahu was supported by members of the Knesset Ya'akov Katz and Uri Ariel of the National Union, who condemned the \\"summoning to interrogation of the great leaders of Israel\\", and the \\"persecution of the Torah and its rabbis\\". National Union MK Michael Ben-Ari proposed a bill (originally drafted by former MK Shmuel Halpert of Agudat Yisrael) that would give rabbis who work for the state immunity from prosecution from actions and pronouncements in connection with leadership duties or religious pronouncements, similar to the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by MKs.

It was written by Kevin Taylor and Michael Wisher for Hyde Fundraisers, a group of science fiction fans who make and appear in replica costumes from TV series and films such as Doctor Who and Star Wars to raise funds for various charities. The play was performed twice; in 1993 and 2005. The second production was performed with the agreement and backing of both the BBC and the estate of screenwriter Terry Nation, the creator of the Davros character. Synopsis The action takes place within the immediate continuity of the Doctor Who serial Genesis Of The Daleks. As Davros' creations, the Daleks, prepare to kill him at the conclusion of that story he is removed from time by the Time Lords to be tried for his crimes. The case against him includes personal testimony and evidence of Dalek atrocities throughout the centuries. Ultimately it is revealed that the trial has been a ruse by Davros to create a time portal to Gallifrey, enabling his new Daleks to attack and exterminate the Time Lords. The play ends with Davros and his Daleks victorious. The 1993 production The play was performed on 14 November 1993 at \\"Remembrance '93\\", a Doctor Who convention held at The Village Hotel, Hyde, Greater Manchester. It was produced by Nigel Peever, with the cast including Michael Wisher (Davros), Jean RogersJean Rogers IMDb Listing (Inquisitor), Keith Noble (Prosecutor), Stuart Glazebrook (Prosecutor) and Peter Miles (Nyder).

The original 1993 script was expanded with additional material by Kevin Taylor, contributions from Terry Molloy and a new scene written by Michael Wisher. The production also included filmed sequences created for the production by the Hyde Fundraisers team, referencing the Doctor Who serials The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Day of the Daleks, Frontier in Space, and Death to the Daleks.

The Davros mask was created by sculptor Phil Robinson, who also provided the masks and prosthetics for the Exillon, Ogron and Draconian alien creatures seen in the filmed sections of the production. Cast notes Although produced by a voluntary group established to raise funds for charity, the plays are notable for the casting of professional actors in the major roles. In particular Michael Wisher and Terry Molloy had portrayed Davros in the Doctor Who television series, while Peter Miles reprised his role as Nyder from Genesis of the Daleks in both productions.

The film is set in the period shortly before and during the invasion of South Korea by North Korean troops. Dragonfly Squadron was originally intended to be released as a 3D film, and therefore was filmed in dual 35mm Polaroid 3-D.Furmanek, Bob. \\"Review: 'Dragonfly Squadron'.\\" 3-D Film Archive. Retrieved: May 23, 2016. Interest in 3D films, however, greatly diminished towards the end of 1953, so when the film premiered in Los Angeles on January 27, 1954, and went on general release on March 21, 1954, only flat prints were shown. Plot In May 1950, Major Matt Brady (John Hodiak) is redeployed to Pusan, South Korea. His mission there is to train South Korean pilots in the defensive struggle. Also, there are air support exercises in case the Americans need to be evacuated. Colonel Schuller (Richard Simmons) sends Brady and Captain MacIntyre (Gerald Mohr) to the airbase in Kungju. The American instructors only have 25 days left to introduce the South Korean pilots to U.S. training and tactics. At the base, Brady meets Donna Cottrell (Barbara Britton), his former fianc√©. Her husband, Red Cross physician Dr. Stephen Cottrell (Bruce Bennett), is said to have been killed in action. When Donna finds out that he is actually alive - he had been captured, but was able to escape - she returns to him. She tells Matt that Stephen cannot work as a surgeon any more, as his hands were badly injured during enemy torture. She is intent on doing the right thing, but feels torn between the two men. The training of the South Korean pilots makes progress, which is carefully noted by Dixon (Jess Barker), a reporter. Captain Veddors (Harry Lauter) tells him that Matt does not fly any more because he once caused a fatal crash with a test pilot. Matt receives an encrypted message announcing a serious enemy attack. MacIntyre informs Matt that Lieutenant Kim-Sun is not able to fly due to the illness of his sister, but Matt needs every man. Kim-Sun dies in the crash of his aircraft and, as a consequence, the pilots blame Matt. MacIntyre suspects that Kim-Sun's aircraft was sabotaged. Colonel Schuller orders the evacuation of all Americans and gives Matt the order to release the South Korean pilots into active service. Stephen stays behind in Kungju to carry on his work, while Donna leaves the base in a convoy. The convoy is attacked by two tanks. Colonel Conners cautions Matt that air support for the convoy is out of the question but, by sanction of the United Nations, intervention by U.S. infantrymen is possible. Matt stays behind on the base with Veddors and MacIntyre. Soon the news of the invasion of South Korea arrives. Captain Warnowski and his infantry battalion reach Kungju. Due to heavy tank assaults, of the original complement of 400 men, only 30 remain. The infantry find Captain Wyler (Adam Williams), who was driving the truck Donna was in. Before he dies of his wounds, he tells Matt that Donna has successful escaped. As the attacks intensify, North Korean aircraft damage the airfield, subsequently, Matt and Warnowski decide to retreat. The South Koreans identify an old woman as a spy, who has been transmitting information about the base to the enemy by radio, and execute her. Matt and his remaining troops come under heavy fire with Matt being wounded and Veddors killed. In Chungtu village, they reach a Red Cross hospital, and soon Donna too arrives there. There she hears that Stephen was killed during the fighting. The enemy tanks thrust forward and force the survivors to retreat further. When U.S. aircraft attack and stop the tanks, Matt, Donna and the rest of the convoy escape.

The club colours are maroon and white. The Wolves' have men's teams in Premier Division, Premier Division Reserves, Division 2 and a Division 1 under 19's team. In the Women's competition, the Wolves field a Division 1 and a Division 3 side in 2019. Manly Warringah's home ground is Weldon Oval located in the northern Sydney suburb of Harbord. History The Manly-Warringah Wolves were formed in 1969. Founding members Harry Marston, George Klause and Bruce Hutton discovered enough interest on the northern beaches for an Australian Rules team to be formed. The club started in the SFL Under-20 competition. The following year Manly-Warringah joined the newly formed Sydney District Association. The formation of this competition was the culmination of several clubs‚Äô efforts, none more so than Manly, and in particular Harry Marston. The Wolves have been a dominant performer in the Sydney AFL First Division competition. Manly-Warringah has now won Sydney AFL First Grade premierships in 1990, 1995, 1996 and in recent years has reached the finals in the past 8 successive seasons including premierships in 2007, 2011 and 2012. The Wolves were promoted to Premier Division in 2013 after an undefeated 2012 season in Division 1 and a percentage of over five hundred. They also had an astonishing average winning margin of over one hundred points per game. After Division One premierships in 2011 and 2012, the 2013 season saw the Manly Warringah Wolves promoted to the Sydney AFL Premier Division for the first time in their history. The Wolves won their first game in the Sydney AFL Premier Division 159 - 42 against 2012 grand finalist, Balmain Dockers. The wolves had a dream start in the premier division winning 9 straight games to start the season. The wolves finished 2013 with the minor premiership. The wolves had the first week off in the semi finals before beating St George Dragons 85 - 67 to qualify for the grand final and earn a week off. The wolves faced Pennant Hills in the grand final and ran out winners 80 - 72. They are the first team in Sydney AFL history to win the grand final after being promoted to the Premier Division. Season 2014 saw the dawn of a new era, in which the Wolves formed an Alliance with the GWS GIANTS, in turn changing the name from the Manly Wolves to the Manly Giants. It was a significant development for football on the northern beaches. On the field the success in the Premier division continued with the wolves having a dominant season winning a second premiership having only losing one game for the season. This year also marked the establishment of Manly-Warringah's first ever female team. Alisa Kelley, rallied up enough interest to form the first ever senior women's AFL team on the Northern Beaches. The team was entered into the Division 2 AFL Sydney competition and finished 6th in their maiden season. Moving into 2016 and the club was renamed back to the original \\"Manly- Warringah Wolves\\". In 2018, the Wolves were successful in entering in a second women's team into the AFL Sydney Competition. In 2018, the club fielded women's teams in Division 1 and Division 2. After a successful 2018 campaign for Division 1, the team remains in this league in 2019 and are a strong top 4 team. The Division 2 side has been relegated to Division 3 for 2019.

However, existing law requires judicial approval of all coupon settlements, and in most cases, class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement though class members, despite opt-out notices, may be unaware of their right to opt out because they did not receive the notice, did not read it, or did not understand it. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) addresses some of those concerns. Coupon settlements may be audited by an independent expert before judicial approval to ensure that the settlement will be of value to the class members (28 U.S.C.A. 1712(d)). In the United States, federal courts must hold a hearing and make specific findings that the coupon settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and that the class members' interests are represented. The following can be taken into consideration during the hearing: # The strength of the class member's case. # The risk, expense, complexity, and duration of further litigation. # The risk of maintaining class action status. # The amount offered to each class member in settlement. # The form of the settlement (coupons, checks, replacement products, or services). # The amount offered in total in settlement. # The extent of the discovery that has been completed. # The experience of counsel. # The presence of a governmental participant. # The reaction of class members to the proposed settlement. Another criticism has been that plaintiffs' lawyers involved in coupon settlements receive cash fees in amounts that generally dwarf the award recovered by individual class members.

The device was made by clinical researchers and medical Doctors at Columbia University, University of Colorado at Anschutz Medical Campus, and the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. Intracortical encephalogram signal analysis has two components: 1) an intracortical EEG multicontact electrode (ICE) that inserted through a patient's skull and deep into the grey matter of the patient, and 2) an artificial intelligent agent that is trained in neurological signal analysis. Clinical use The (ICE) component comprises a catheter with platinum sensors that, when inserted into the brain allows for recording directly from the cerebral cortex of patients with acute brain injury. The Artificial Intelligent (see Machine learning) and Knowledge Discovery of neurological signals component was first derived from using Intracortical Electrodes in rats (see Brain‚Äìcomputer interface) to predicting epilepsy seizures in rats by 6 seconds (see Seizure prediction) [15]. These models used in the clinical environs of noisy domains, spectral analysis, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), discrete finite automata and sequential and coincident power spectra are incorporated into the ICE component to read, learn and predict severe Neurological disorders. =Clinical demand= The prediction, detection and interpretation of abnormal brain electrical activity is an area wherein technological advancement is necessary in that current state-of-the-art methods for electroencephalography (EEG) are retrospective, prone to subjectivity and obviate real-time data interpretation that is often necessary to allow timely and accurate therapeutic intervention by neurologist and neurosurgeon.

The group was for some time the only U.S. carrier strike group that did not have an assigned aircraft carrier or carrier air wing. As of December 2010, it directed the cruisers and . Carrier Strike Group 14 was seemingly last based at Naval Station Mayport. Without a carrier flagship, it did not conduct the typical deployments of other carrier strike groups; instead, its two cruisers made independent voyages. The group is not listed in the Administrative Organisation of the Operating Forces of the United States Navy: Fleet Chain of Command, March 2012, and thus appears to have been disestablished. Overview The group commander exercised oversight of unit-level training, integrated training, and readiness for assigned units, as well as maintains administrative functions and material readiness tracking for the group's units. The group reported to the Commander of the United States Fleet Forces Command. The group's pre-deployment training and certification would have theoretically come under the control of Fleet Forces Command following the disestablishment of the U.S. Second Fleet on 30 September 2011. However, without a carrier assigned, the group does not conduct pre-deployment group workups. Administratively, Gettysburg and Philippine Sea were under the authority of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic. Ticonderoga class cruisers provide a wide range of capabilities, including ballistic missile defense (BMD), regional air defense (RAD), battlespace management (BSM), maritime interdiction operations (MIO), maritime security operations (MSO), and precision strike tomahawk (PST) strike missions. History 1973‚Äì2004 Effective 30 June 1973, Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 12 was re- designated as Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 (CCDG-12). In May 1975, Leahy and , under the command of Rear Admiral Justin D. Langille III, visited Leningrad, as reported by the Chicago Tribune of May 13, 1975. It appears the two ships formed a task group of Task Force 100 during the visit. In 1986, while commanding Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12, Rear Admiral Henry H. Mauz, Jr., commanded the carrier battle group and Task Group 60.3, part of Task Force 60, U.S. Sixth Fleet during an operation codenamed 'Attain Document', which led to the Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986). The operation was intended to assert the freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Sidra as well as to challenge the territorial claims of Libya to the area. Subsequently, the America carrier battle group and the rest of Task Force 60 carried out Operation El Dorado Canyon, a series of punitive strikes against Libya in retaliation for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing. Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 previously served as Immediate Superior-in-Command for , Carrier Air Wing Eight, Destroyer Squadron 18, , and USS Philippine Sea (CG-58). CCDG-12 reported to Commander, Second Fleet as one of six carrier battle group Commanders in the Atlantic Fleet. CCDG-12's 2003 deployment included the destroyers , , and . On 1 September 2004, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 12 transferred command of the USS Enterprise (CVN 65) and its Carrier Strike Group to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8. This apparently left Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 without an assigned aircraft carrier. On 1 October 2004, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 was redesignated Carrier Strike Group 14. As of 2010, Carrier Strike Group 14 may have been deactivated. The Navy's Strike Group 14 webpage is no longer active, and the admiral listed in command is no longer mentioned in the official US Navy biography website of currently active flag officers, suggesting this officer may have since retired. It was announced on 22 October 2009 that the last listed commander of the group, Rear Admiral Bernard J McCullough, was to be reassigned from deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources, N8, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, for reappointment to the grade of vice admiral and assignment as commander, Fleet Cyber Command/commander, Tenth Fleet, Fort Meade, Md. 2005 operations On 25 May 2005, USS Philippine Sea departed Naval Station Mayport, Florida, for a four-month surge deployment in support of Maritime Inerdiction Operations (MIO) in the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea, returning on 8 December 2005. USS Gettysburg and its embarked U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) completed a six-month Counter Narco- Terrorism operations in the western Hemisphere as part of Joint Interagency Task Force South which ended on 4 April 2006. 2006 operations On 6 June 2006, USS Philippine Sea departed Naval Station Mayport for a six-months in support of maritime security operations (MSO) and Operation Iraqi Freedom in the Persian Gulf, returning 8 December. 2007 0perations USS Philippine Sea completed an Expeditionary Strike Group Integration (ESGINT) exercise and a 17-day Composite Unit Training Exercise (COMPTUEX) in preparation for its 2008 overseas deployment. On 6 July, USS Gettysburg departed Naval Station Mayport on a five-and-a-half month deployment involving Maritime Security Operations (MSO) in the Persian Gulf, including 71 consecutive days supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) before returning on 19 December 2007. 2008 operations During its U.S. Sixth Fleet deployment to the Mediterranean Sea, tracked a contact of interest, the motor vessel Iran Bagheri, between 11‚Äì13 March 2008. Following 3-day port visit to Souda Bay, Crete, Philippine Sea participated in Caya Green 08, a bilateral two-phased military exercise with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Between 16‚Äì19 March, Phase I involved Philippine Sea leading U.S. naval assets conducting maritime patrols and harbor sweeps in Haifa with Israeli air assets. Following pre-sail planning meetings in Haifa, Phase II began on 24 March, and Philippine Sea and the Israeli Navy participated in small-boat defense, convoying operations, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) against a non-nuclear diesel-electric submarine in a littoral environment. Following the conclusion of Caya Green 08, Philippine Sea departed Haifa on 26 March. Goal Keeper III On 29 March 2008, Philippine Sea transited the Suez Canal with the vehicle cargo ship and the guided-missile destroyers and . On 9 April, Philippine Sea escorted the departing amphibious assault ship , and following a port visit to Fujairah, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Philippine Sea participated in Arabian Shark ‚Äô08/SHAREM, a multilateral anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise in the Gulf of Oman held between 14‚Äì20 April 2008. Following Arabian Shark ‚Äô08/SHAREM, between 22‚Äì20 April, Philippine Sea operated with Combined Task Force 158 (CTF-158) protecting the Al Basrah Oil Terminal, as well as conducting maritime security operations and maritime interception operation for the CTF-158, in the Persian Gulf. Following its second port visit to Jebel Ali, Philippine Sea participated in Goal Keeper III, a multilateral maritime security operation exercise (pictured), before returning to the CTF-158 area of responsibility (AOR) on 14 May. Following a four-day port visit to Bahrain, Philippine Sea completed its Persian Gulf tour of duty by escorting the amphibious assault ship , the dock landing ship , and the guided-missile destroyer through the Straits of Hormuz on 31 April 2008. Philippine Sea completed its 2008 MED deployment with port visits to Aksaz, Turkey; Split, Croatia; and Sicily, Italy, before returning to Naval Station Norfolk on 11 July 2008. 2009 operations On 21 February 2009, Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser departed Naval Station Mayport. During its 2009 overseas deployment, Gettysburg served as the flagship of Combined Task Force (CTF-151), an international naval task force to counter piracy activity off the coast of Somalia, under the overall command of Rear Admiral Caner Bener of the Turkish Navy. VBSS boarding (13 May 2009) The most significant accomplishment during Gettysburgs tour of duty as CTF-151 was the capture of more than a dozen suspected pirates aboard an alleged \\"mothership\\" on 13 May 2009. The Republic of Korea destroyer Munmu the Great and Gettysburg responded to a distress call from the Egyptian-flagged merchantship MV Amira, which was under attack 75 nautical miles (138.9 km) south of Mukalla, Yemen.

All 17 passengers were transferred to Gettysburg for further questioning. On 28 June 2009, the guided-missile cruiser relieved USS Gettysburg (CG-64) as the flagship for Combined Task Force 151. Commenting on Gettysburgs three-month tour of duty as CTF-151's flagship, Admiral Bener noted: :Whatever the situation, whether engaged in the boarding or the safe and secure holding of suspected pirates for 28 days, Gettysburg undertook them all without complaint. The experience Gettysburg and her crew brought to our mission as flagship was a major key to our success in counterpiracy operations over the last couple months.

It was founded by Ivan Snyder, active from 1975 to 1997, during the growth and consolidation of the direct market. Heroes World was acquired by Marvel Comics in late 1994 to act as the publisher's sole distributor. This ill-fated move, combined with other marketplace factors of the time, resulted in the financial failure of many other comics distributors and retailers ‚Äî and the near collapse of the entire North American comic book market.  History  = Origins = In the early 1970s, Ivan Snyder was head of licensing in Marvel Comics Group's merchandising department. In this role, he was in charge of selling various Marvel licensed products via mail order. After a change in management in the mid-1970s, Marvel discontinued the mail order service, and Snyder purchased the business in 1975, renaming it Superhero Enterprises. Initially running the business out his basement, Snyder shortly thereafter moved into a storefront in Morristown, New Jersey, with a catalog showroom store format. A second store was opened in a Livingston shopping mall, with DC Comics products added to their product mix. When the former Mego Corporation trademark \\"Superhero\\" was purchased by Marvel and DC, Superheroes Enterprise was forced to change its name to Heroes World. By 1982, Heroes World's retail chain had expanded to 12 locations, while it continued its mail order distribution business.

He was Attorney-General for Ireland from 1905 to 1909, a judge of the Irish Court of Appeal and subsequently Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland 1913‚Äì1916. A Liberal, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Exchange in 1906. Cherry's published works include Lectures on the Growth of Criminal Law in Ancient Communities, 1890, and a book on the Irish Land Acts which was described as an indispensable part of every Irish barrister's library.Healy, Maurice The Old Munster Circuit Michael Joseph Ltd. 1939 He was president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland between 1908 and 1911.http://www.ssisi.ie/ssisi_presidents_6_5_2014.pdf Background and education Cherry was born in Waterford, the second son of Robert William Cherry, a solicitor; the family was of French Huguenot origin. He was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, where he had been auditor of the College Historical Society and secretary of the University Philosophical Society. Legal career In 1889 Cherry became Reid Professor of Criminal and Constitutional Law at Trinity College Dublin, and published two books on criminal law. He was called to the Bar in 1881 and became Queen's Counsel in 1896. His promising career was, according to his family, damaged by his staunch opposition to the Boer War, although this did not prevent his appointment as Attorney General for Ireland in 1905 or his election to the House of Commons the following year. His elevation to the Bench in 1909 was said to be due to his desire to be relieved from the extreme pressure of his work as a Law Officer; possibly he was already suffering from ill-health, although it was not until some years later that he was diagnosed with what was described as \\"slow paralysis\\". His illness did not prevent his promotion to the office of Lord Chief Justice; however he served only three years, retiring partly through ill-health and partly because the Government was very anxious to promote James Campbell to the Chief Justice's office. After the Easter Rising he served briefly as Lord Justice of Ireland, entrusted with emergency powers of government. His retirement was as active as his increasingly bad health allowed: he divided his time between his summer house at Greystones, County Wicklow, and his town house at St. Stephen's Green, where he died. He married Mary Cooper in 1886; their daughter Mary published a biography of her father in 1924. =Bodkin's case= As Attorney General Cherry became embroiled in the politically sensitive case of Matthias Bodkin, a barrister and well-known journalist, who was appointed a County Court judge, only to find his appointment challenged on the grounds that he was not, as the law requires, a \\"practicing barrister\\". The case eventually settled, but not before Cherry's conduct of it had come in for severe criticism. A M Sullivan, one of the counsel involved, called his arguments \\"nonsense\\"; Maurice Healy wrote that his argument that the royal prerogative could not be questioned \\"would have rejoiced the heart of James I\\" but did not impress an Irish Court in the early 1900s.The Old Munster Circuit =Reputation= Maurice Healy, who had first-hand experience of appearing before Cherry, did not rate him highly. While praising his legal textbooks, he considered him a plodding barrister and a well-meaning but ineffectual law officer and judge: \\"his knowledge of his fellow men was not extensive, and erred towards charity.\\" Healy allows that he had at least the virtue of courtesy, at a time when many of the Irish judiciary had acquired a regrettable reputation for rudeness and impatience. More recently Hogan in a much fuller account of Cherry's career gives a far more favourable picture: he argues that Cherry's rapid rise in his profession suggests a much greater degree of legal ability than Healy allows, and that his speeches and judgments show him to have been a man of intelligence and originality. Hogan agrees with Healy that Cherry was not an outstanding judge, and was too much inclined to agree with his colleagues, but argues that his few long judgments are of high quality, especially those on land law, on which he was an acknowledged expert.Hogan, Daire \\"Richard Robert Cherry, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland\\" published in Mysteries and Solutions in Irish Legal History Four Courts Press 2001  Personal life  Cherry was noted as an expert bellringer, and he, along with Gabriel Lindoff and Digby Scott, founded the Irish Association of Change Ringers in 1895, and was soon after appointed President of the Association. Cherry also presented two trebles to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin in 1909, making it the first twelve-bell tower in Ireland. He was involved on the first peal on the twelve bells, which is believed to have been the first peal on twelve bells rung outside England.

Intended for use as an auxiliary weapon by bomber aircraft, the missile was successfully test fired in 1958, but the program was cancelled in the early 1960s. Design and development The Wagtail project was initiated in 1956, with Minneapolis-Honeywell being contracted to develop a short-range, solid-rocket-powered missile.American Aviation Publications, 1958. Missiles and Rockets, Volume 5. p. 26. The missile would be armed with a low-yield nuclear warhead, and was intended for use as a tactical support missile by supersonic aircraft engaged in low-level attacks.Parsch 2003Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1960, p.463. The Wagtail missile was intended to be fitted with a guidance system that utilised an inertial navigation system and a terrain-following radar, which allowed the missile to be fired from and navigate at extremely low altitudes. The missile was equipped with small retrorockets that retarded the missile following release, allowing the launching aircraft the opportunity to escape the blast wave from the missile's warhead. Operational history By 1958, the Wagtail project had progressed to the point of live-fire flight testing; the missile was planned to be fitted to the B-58 Hustler bomber in operational service, while an alternative configuration was proposed as a bomber defense missile, which would be fired rearwards from the carrier aircraft. However, in the early 1960s (prior to fiscal year 1962), despite the missiles' flight testing having proved successful,Huisken 1981, p.61. the Wagtail project was canceled.

Warschauer Stra√üe, 1910 In the southern part the route is identical with the historic customs city wall that was begirding the Old Berlin until 1861. The city wall had roads along its length so that after the wall was torn down it opened spaces similar to a boulevard. In the western part there had been the Entlastungsstra√üe road cut through the Great Tiergarten park to avoid the places around the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag by about a mile. In the northern part the route takes advantage of one of the Hobrecht-Plan ring roads which runs considerably more outside of the Old Berlin limits so that there is no historic connection from Invalidenstra√üe to Bernauer Stra√üe. The open space at Bernauer Stra√üe is a consequence of the Berlin Wall which led to old buildings along the street to be torn down. Rebuilding Invalidenstra√üe into a major road is the only thing left to close the Inner Ring Road. It was supposed to be finished in 2002 when the new main station had opened but it was blocked by court decision. It was left until end of December 2010 that finally all trials were dismissed and the court approved the plan which will rebuild the street into four lanes plus tram rail tracks and bicycle lanes.http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article1489700/Invalidenstrasse-wird- vierspurig-ausgebaut.html The senator announced that construction will start in spring of 2011 but one can not expect the new road to open before the mid of 2013.http://stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_1012/nachricht4170.html Berlin's urban planning department expects the last of three phases to be finished during 2015.

This replaced the Interim National Constitution of the Republic of Sudan, 2005 (INC) adopted on 6 July 2005, which had been suspended on 11 April 2019 by Lt. Gen Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf in the 2019 Sudanese coup d'√©tat. 1973 and 1998 constitutions The first permanent Constitution of Sudan was drafted in 1973. It incorporated the Addis Ababa Agreement (1972) ending the first Sudanese civil war. The 1985 military coup led to suspension of Sudan's 1973 constitution and its replacement with an interim constitution later in the year. One of the first acts of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation after seizing power in 1989 was to abolish the interim constitution. President Omar Al-Bashir promised to prepare a new constitution. It was not until January 1998, however, that Sudan convened a constitutional conference to draft a constitution. It consisted of legal and political scholars representing different political groups sympathetic to al-Bashir‚Äôs rule. The Umma Party and the Democratic Unionist Party refused to participate. Most Southerners boycotted the conference. Voters in Sudan‚Äôs single-party system approved the constitution in a 1998 referendum, a process that raised questions about the degree to which the public accepted the document.Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p595 The constitution entered into force on July 1, 1998. A significant feature of the individual-rights provisions of the 1998 constitution was the frequent use of the qualifier ‚Äúin accordance with law‚Äù attached to most freedoms. On the other hand, there was no requirement that only Muslims could hold public office, including the office of president. Non-Muslims were free to practice, convert, and doubt the main tenets of their religion as long as they did not interfere with the spiritual life of Muslims. There were, nevertheless, inherent conflicts between Sudan‚Äôs Islamic political system and the way in which Muslims applied the principles of shura. The constitution attempted to balance a strong preference for Islamic beliefs and a grudging acceptance of internationally accepted human rights. In 1999 dissenting members of the National Assembly (the lower house of the legislature) tried to amend the constitution by restricting the president‚Äôs involvement in the selection of candidates for governors of the federal states. Speaker of the National Assembly Hassan Al-Turabi supported the amendment, but the proposal led al-Bashir to dissolve the National Assembly and declare a state of emergency under the constitution. These steps had the effect of suspending the decentralization process stipulated in the constitution and gave al-Bashir full authority over the states. Legislators supporting al-Turabi challenged the state of emergency before the Constitutional Court, which concluded that al-Bashir‚Äôs actions were constitutional.  2005 Interim National Constitution  On May 26, 2004, the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed the Protocol on Power Sharing, later part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The protocol provided for a National Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) composed of representatives from the National Congress Party, SPLM, other political forces, and civil society. It was charged with preparing a legal and constitutional framework based on the peace agreement and the 1998 constitution for adoption by the National Assembly and the SPLM. The result was the Interim National Constitution of the Republic of Sudan, which the National Assembly and the SPLM National Liberation Council adopted on July 6, 2005. For its part, the Government of South Sudan then adopted on December 5, 2005, an Interim Constitution of South Sudan that did not contradict any of the provisions contained in the Interim National Constitution. The NCRC prepared a model constitution for all 25 states, compatible with both the Interim National Constitution and the one for South Sudan. The states of South Sudan adopted their own constitutions, which had to conform to both interim constitutions. Before the end of the six-year interim period mandated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the NCRC was also responsible for organizing an inclusive constitutional-review process. According to the Interim National Constitution, the crucial six-year interim period began officially on July 9, 2005. Both the Interim National Constitution and the Interim Constitution of South Sudan authorized the 15 states in the North and the 10 states in South Sudan to have their own constitutions. States in the North began the constitutional drafting process in mid-2005 based on a model constitution drafted by a subcommittee of the NCRC. The most controversial process was in Khartoum State where there were concerns about the rights of non-Muslims and human rights generally. Blue Nile and South Kordofan States, disputed areas that are also strategically located, posed problems for the constitutional-development process. The drafting of state constitutions in the South began later than in the North but was relatively uncontroversial because the SPLM held a 70 percent majority in the state legislatures and could largely control the outcome. The Interim National Constitution was officially suspended following the April 2019 military coup which overthrew the country's President of 30 years Omar al-Bashir. August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration On 5 July 2019, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) alliance, representing a wide range of citizens' groups, political opposition parties and armed opposition groups who had protested for many months since December 2018 via massive and sustained civil disobedience, agreed on a deal with the Transitional Military Council (TMC) for a 39-month plan of recreating political institutions to return to a democratic system. On 3 August 2019, the Political Agreement from July was complemented by a more extensive constitutional document, with 70 legal articles organised in 16 chapters, called the Draft Constitutional Declaration.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/world/africa/sudan-power- sharing-deal.htmlhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49213901 The document was signed on 4 August 2019 by Ahmed Rabie of the FFC and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\") of the TMC.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49226130 The Draft Constitutional Declaration defines the leadership, institutions and procedures for the 39-month transition period.

A leading man, he became well known for his stage interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, was an early mentor of Charlie Chaplin, and is considered an authority on the work of Sir Henry Irving. Called Arthur by his friends, professionally he used his initials.Robert W. Pohle, Douglas C. Hart, Sherlock Holmes on the screen: the motion picture adventures of the world's most popular detective (A. S.

II (1946), p. 504 Early life The son of Frederic Saintsbury, Esq., of the Bank of England, Saintsbury was born in Chelsea, London, on 18 December 1869, into a middle-class family. His father had married Sarah Charlotte, second daughter of Robert Lemon, FSA, of Her Majesty's State Paper Office, at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, on 13 October 1854.The Gentleman's magazine and historical review, vol. 196, p. 386David Robinson, Chaplin, his life and art (1985), p. 45 He was educated at St John's College, Hurstpierpoint, and began his working life as a clerk in the Bank of England.'SAINTSBURY, H. A., actor and dramatic author', in Who's Who in the Theatre 1936, p. 1283 Career In March, 1887, Saintsbury made his first appearance on stage at the Opera Comique Theatre as a super in Kate Vaughan's revival of Reade and Taylor's Masks and Faces. His first leading part was as Captain Temple, touring in Pettitt and Harris's melodrama Human Nature. Saintsbury as Iachimo in Cymbeline, c. 1906 As 'Jay Nibb', Saintsbury wrote several plays for the stage. Those produced include Betrayed by a Kiss (1891), The Friend of the People (1893), The Doctor's Shadow (1896), His Relations (1896), The Eleventh Hour (1896, in collaboration with Ronald MacDonald), The Three Musketeers (1898), Chicot the Jester (1898), The First Night (1899), Don Caesar de Bazan (1899), and Jim: a Romance of Cockayne (1903).Nicoll, op. cit., p. 554 Saintsbury made his name as a romantic actor of the \\"cloak and swords school\\", and by the end of the 19th century was a considerable force in the Victorian stage. Shortly after the Lyceum Theatre, Birmingham, opened in May 1901, and before it was renamed the Alexandra Theatre, its promoters engaged Saintsbury, \\"the first star from the great outside to walk the theatre's boards\\". From the middle of June 1901 he was at the new theatre as leading man for ten weeks, playing flamboyantly in costume dramas such as Jane Shore, David Garrick, and his own Don Cesar de Bazan.Mickie F. K. Fraser, Alexandra Theatre: the story of a popular playhouse (Cornish Brothers, 1948), pp. 2‚Äì3 In 1903, Saintsbury took the thirteen-year-old Charlie Chaplin under his wing when Chaplin was hired for a small stage part after being sent to meet Saintsbury at the Green Room Club in Leicester Square for his approval. He was given the role of 'Sam, a news boy' in Saintsbury's play Jim: a Romance of Cockayne, in which Saintsbury was the leading man. The play ran for two weeks, when Chaplin was given the part of Billy, the page boy of Sherlock Holmes in William Gillette's play Sherlock Holmes, in which the title role was again played by Saintsbury. Chaplin was paid two pounds, ten shillings, a week, a good income for a boy.A. J. Marriot, Chaplin: stage by stage (Marriot, 2005), pp. 42, 51 & 214 By 1903, Saintsbury was living at the Green Room Club, which was to remain his home for the rest of his life. In 1910, Saintsbury played Sherlock Holmes for five months in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's own stage play The Speckled Band. Charles Millward took over the role when the production moved to New York, but Saintsbury returned as Holmes in a West End revival of the play in 1921. Saintsbury played the role of Holmes again in a 1916 film, The Valley of Fear, which is believed lost, opposite Booth Conway as Professor Moriarty. By the time the film was made, Saintsbury had played Holmes more than a thousand times on stage, and by 1921 he had taken this total to 1,400 performances. His interpretation of Holmes was notably restrained and made a powerful impression on the young Charlie Chaplin, who wrote of Saintsbury in 1964: A former colleague of Sir Henry Irving, near the end of his own life Saintsbury edited and collated We Saw Him Act: a symposium on the art of Sir Henry Irving, consisting of essays, articles, and anecdotes written by Irving's contemporaries. First published in 1939, the work of editing the book was completed by Cecil Palmer and the result was reprinted in 1969.

Design and development The failure of the first fighter designed at Brasov did not discourage the energetic team of the I.A.R. Works. Even before the second prototype of the C.V. 11 was disqualified from the fighter contest, the first details of its successor had already been laid out by Engineer-in-Chief Carafoli. A new tail with enlarged rudder was fitted to essentially the same fuselage, giving a more conventional look and offering better control during flight. As a consequence, the overall height increased by more than a meter, i.e. 40% of the original dimension. Unlike the IAR 11 design, the wingtips were rounded, and the span had been increased as well, giving a 19.80 m¬≤ wing area compared to the original 18.20 m¬≤ of the C.V. 11. An anti-crash pylon with a minuscule Venturi-tube installed at its top appeared behind the cockpit to protect the pilot in case the aircraft overturned. The powerplant chosen for the new aircraft, named I.A.R. 12, was again a Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb, that offered 450 h.p. (336 kW) at 1,900 r.p.m., similar to the type fitted to the first C.V. 11. However, due to the increased aerodynamic drag, the maximum speed at ground level decreased to 294 km/h. This unsatisfactory result, combined with poor handling characteristics experienced during early test flights, constrained Carafoli to improve the construction and try a new engine, fitted to essentially the same fuselage, giving a more conventional look and offering better control during flight. An anti-crash pylon with a minuscule Venturi-tube installed at its top appeared behind the cockpit to protect the pilot in case the aircraft overturned.

In 1638, it was converted at the behest of Venice's city leaders into a government-owned gambling house. Importantly, Il Ridotto was the site of the West's first public, legal mercantile casino. Etymology and usage The term \\"ridotto\\" (plural: \\"ridotti\\") comes from the Italian word \\"ridurre\\", meaning to \\"close off\\" or \\"make private\\". Whatever its etymology, it ordinarily meant the foyer of a theater, where people would go for refreshments during intermissions. It also referred to several illegal, privately owned gambling clubs that offered games of chance to members of Venice's nobility in the city's Rialto District. These clubs came into being after the Venetian authorities attempted to ban games of chance that had spontaneously sprung up in the city's streets. Realizing it could not effectively prevent citizens from wagering on dice and card games, the Great Council of Venice opened its \\"Ridotto\\" in 1638 on the occasion of the city's annual Spring Carnival. Casino Era According to the casino's original charter, access to Il Ridotto was open to the public. However, due to its high stakes and formal dress code, only nobles could afford to play at the casino's tables; one such discriminating injunction, for instance, was that players had to wear three-cornered hats and masks in order to participate in Il Ridotto's games; less affluent Venetians were thereby prohibited from making wagers at the casino's tables. As for games, Il Ridotto is known to have offered biribi and basetta. Biribi was a lottery-like game in which players placed bets on one of 70 possible outcomes. A casino employee, the \\"banker\\", would then draw a number from a bag, and anyone who had bet on that number would win the game's pot. The game featured a built-in vigorish whereby a winning player only collected 64 times his original bet; considering that every outcome in the game gave only roughly a 1 percent chance of winning for any given bet, this meant that the house at Il Ridotto enjoyed nearly a 10 percent vigorish on the game. The most popular game at Il Ridotto, however, was the card game basetta. This game was a cross between blackjack, poker, and gin rummy and offered winning players 60 times their wagers in payout. In later years, it was replaced by card game faro, which would gain even greater popularity in the U.S. Ca' Rezzonico - Il Ridotto di palazzo Dandolo a San Moise - Francesco Guardi.jpgIl Ridotto di palazzo Dandolo a San Moise by Francesco Guardi Pietro Longhi - De speelbank (Il ridotto).jpgIl Ridotto by Pietro Longhi Pietro Longhi - Il Ridotto - WGA13405.jpgIl Ridotto by Longhi Architecture The wing of the San Mois√® Palace in which the Ridotto originally operated was four stories tall and featured a long entrance hall, dining rooms and other fineries like work from artist Gerolamo Colonna. Its gaming tables, meanwhile, were primarily situated in its upper floors. Closing In 1774, Venetian reformer Giorgio Pisani proposed the city close the Ridotto \\"to preserve the piety, sound discipline and moderate behavior\\". Pisani's motion passed by an overwhelming majority and the casino closed its doors the same year.

The Prussian soldiers were demoralized by their shattering defeat at the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt on 14 October and unwilling to put up much resistance. The event occurred during the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Erfurt is located on the Gera River about 40 kilometers west of Jena. Only eight days before, Emperor Napoleon I of France invaded the Electorate of Saxony with a large army and quickly inflicted two minor setbacks on his enemies. This was followed by the catastrophe of 14 October. In the aftermath of the battle, the organization of the Prussian army disintegrated. Large numbers of Prussian fugitives from the battle entered Erfurt and could not be induced to leave. When Murat's French cavalry arrived before the city, it was surrendered without any fighting. Background At the beginning of October, three Prussian armies assembled in the Electorate of Saxony under Feldmarschall Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, General of Infantry Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, and General of Infantry Ernst von R√ºchel. Hohenlohe's army included 20,000 Saxons.Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966. 456 In the center, Brunswick concentrated at Erfurt, Hohenlohe defended Rudolstadt in the east, and R√ºchel held Gotha and Eisenach in the west. General Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach's division of R√ºchel's right wing felt south toward the French line of communications. General Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of W√ºrttemberg's Reserve lay far to the north at Magdeburg.Chandler Campaigns, 459 Jena-Auerstedt Campaign Map, 8‚Äì16 October 1806 On 8 October, Napoleon's 180,000 troops began crossing the Saxon border through the Franconian Forest. His troops formed in a batallion carr√© (battalion square) made up of three columns of two army corps each, plus the Cavalry Reserve, Imperial Guard, and some Bavarian allies.Chandler Campaigns, 467-468 On 9 October, the French won the minor Battle of Schleiz.Petre, F.

The Prussian generals decided to retreat, using the Saale River to protect their flank. Brunswick marched the main army north from Weimar, while Hohenlohe stood on the defensive near Jena as a flank guard.Chandler Campaigns, 472-473 R√ºchel's orders were to stay at Weimar until Saxe-Weimar returned with his division.Petre, 139 The double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt occurred on 14 October as Napoleon attacked Hohenlohe while Brunswick ran into Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps. The troops of Brunswick, Hohenlohe, and R√ºchel were driven in rout from the two battlefields. Brunswick's army lost 13,000 men and its commander was mortally wounded. Hohenlohe and R√ºchel suffered as many as 25,000 casualties.Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars.

He heard about Marshal Louis Davout's triumph at Auerstedt four hours later. Murat's Cavalry Reserve was split, with half directed to advance west to Erfurt and half northwest to Buttelstedt. Napoleon sent Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps toward Erfurt to back up Murat's horsemen, and ordered Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps to Buttelstedt. The emperor instructed Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's untouched I Corps to march to Bad Bibra north of Auerstedt so that he could prevent the fleeing Prussians from escaping east across the Elbe River. In consideration for the troops that had done the hardest fighting on the 14th, he allowed Marshal Jean Lannes' V Corps and Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps to remain near Weimar and Davout's III Corps to march a short distance to Naumburg.Petre, F. Loraine. Napoleon's Conquest of Prussia 1806. London: Lionel Leventhal Ltd., 1993 (1907). . 192-193 Capitulation Wichard von M√∂llendorf After the battles on the 14th, a large number of refugees appeared at Erfurt. At first they were refused entrance, but later the gates were opened and soon the city thronged with at least 12,000 demoralized soldiers. Attempts were made by some officers to return the troops to their regiments, but the men refused to cooperate. By noon on the 15th, Murat was near Erfurt with the leading elements of his cavalry. General-Major von Jung-Larisch stood in battle line in front of the city. His position was poor, with the Gera River at his back, so he ordered his infantry to retreat into the city. Murat's horsemen charged and drove Jung-Larisch's cavalry back across the river, capturing an artillery battery. Losses for this action are not given.Petre, 193 Duke Karl of Saxe-Weimar The Duke of Saxe-Weimar's division, which missed the 14 October battle, soon appeared west of Erfurt. Feldmarschall Wichard Joachim Heinrich von M√∂llendorf attempted to organize an orderly retreat from Erfurt northwest to Bad Langensalza, ordering Saxe-Weimar to cover the move. The wagon train was to lead the retreat, followed by the cavalry, then the infantry. M√∂llendorf, who had been wounded at Auerstedt, then collapsed and proved unable to carry out the operation.Petre, 194 At 2:30 PM, Murat sent French Colonel Claude Antoine Hippolyte Pr√©val into Erfurt under a flag of truce. The Frenchman demanded an immediate surrender, which the Prussian fortress commandant at first refused. Saxe-Weimar waited near Erfurt in the hope that large numbers of troops would join the retreat, but few did so. In the evening, Saxe-Weimar withdrew toward Langensalza. After joining with General Johann Friedrich Winning's detachment, he commanded 12,000 troops and 24 guns in 14 battalions, 30 squadrons, and three batteries.Petre, 195 Marshal Joachim Murat With M√∂llendorf out of the picture, the resolve of the fortress commandant weakened and broke. That night, he signed the articles of capitulation. Included in the terms were the surrender of the Petersberg fortress and large quantities of gunpowder and munitions. Altogether, about 12,000 Prussian and Saxon troops under command of the Prince of Orange became prisoners and 65 artillery pieces were captured. Colors (in parentheses) from the following units were surrendered to the victors, Infantry Regiments Grenadier Garde # 6 (2), Schenck # 9 (4), Wedel # 10 (4), Arnim # 13 (1), Brunswick # 21 (1), Winning # 23 (4), Zenge # 24 (1), Alt- Larisch # 26 (1), Hohenlohe # 32 (2), Prince Ferdinand # 34 (2), Prince Heinrich # 35 (2), Zweiffel # 45 (1), Hessen # 48 (4), and Wartensleben # 59 (2), and Dragoon Regiment Irwing # 3 (4).Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. . 226 Another authority states that between 9,000 and 14,000 Prussian troops fell into French hands at the surrender.Chandler Campaigns, 498 The number may include up to 8,000 wounded. At the time of the capitulation, Murat had about 16,000 troops near Erfurt. The 7,000 cavalry immediately available included General of Division √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division, General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's 2nd Cuirassier Division, and General of Division Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division.Petre, 196 As the first batch of prisoners were being marched from Erfurt to Frankfort-on-the- Main, the column encountered 50 troopers of the Pletz Hussar Regiment # 3. The hussars scattered the inadequate escort and released between 4,000 and 5,000 prisoners. When he heard about it, an enraged Napoleon blamed Murat for the fiasco. However, Saxe-Weimar was unable to exploit this success. He tried to round up the released prisoners but they all ran away, and none could be returned to their units. Result Erfurt's surrender permitted Napoleon to reroute his line of communication from Mainz on the Rhine's west bank, to Frankfort-on-the-Main, Eisenach, Gotha, and Erfurt. He abandoned the more circuitous route through W√ºrzburg and Forchheim. After the surrender, Murat advanced to Langensalza with his three divisions but Saxe-Weimar was able to break contact. General of Division Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc's 4th Dragoon Division, and General of Brigade Antoine Lasalle's light cavalry pursued the Prussians farther to the east, near Wei√üensee and Buttelstedt. The Battle of Halle occurred on 17 October between Bernadotte's corps and Duke Eugene of W√ºrttemberg's Reserve. In the action, the French inflicted 5,000 casualties on the Reserve.Smith, 226-227 Historian Francis Loraine Petre remarked that Erfurt was the first of a series of \\"pusillanimous capitulations\\" by Prussian fortress commanders. He wrote that Napoleon's plans might have been delayed if the city had held out for just a few days. Instead, the French emperor was able to immediately launch the entire army after his fleeing enemies. Notes References * Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon.

It offers several features for redaction, classification and search according to certain criteria. Its interface resembles a text editor and has several panes that give an overview of how content is organized.  How it works  The basic unit of content is a note, and has several characteristics: title, date, keywords (tags), list of activities, attachments (compressed in a ZIP archive) and text that can be formatted and encrypted, and may contain hashtags. Notes are grouped in subjects. A side pane lets you select a subject to view all notes that are part of it, sorted by date, title or by a custom order. Once displayed, a note can be directly edited. Each note has a spreadsheet-like grid to manage a list of activities which is quite similar to the one used in many software of project management. The various activities of one or all the notes of a file of MyNotex may be shown in a diary view and possibly exported in iCal format. This makes MyNotex useful not only for personal use, but also within a team to organize the activities of all its members. Finally, a bottom pane can be used to search notes, also within the previous result set, by subjects, title, content, attachment names, date or keywords.  Features  MyNotex offers various text formatting options (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, color, highlighting, font size and name, paragraph alignment and indentation), image insertion, three title levels as well as automatic recognition of lists (ordered or not) and links (to local files, web addresses, e-mails or another note). Several keyboard shortcuts are set to assist in writing and formatting (like insertion of the current date and time in a new line, move paragraphs up and down or restoration of default font). It's also possible to set globally the space among the paragraphs or within the lines of each paragraph of the text of the notes. Content can be written directly in the software or imported from various sources: * plain text; * OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice text documents; * notes created with Tomboy or Gnote (if a note was already imported, only changes will be imported again); * other files of MyNotex. In any case, the text of a note can be encrypted with AES. MyNotex also allows the user to encrypt and decrypt files with GPG. As for exporting notes, it supports HTML and MyNotex' native format. Also, a note can be copied as LaTeX or opened with OpenOffice.org Writer, LibreOffice Writer or the default web browser, which allows among others to print its content. Anyway, it can be printed also within the program itself. Finally, it's possible to send the text of a note by email. Various organizing features allow to move a note from one subject to another, add comments to each subject, remove content, etc. In addition to search facilities and interface browsing via panes, it's possible to access notes through bookmarks. There is also an alarm clock useful to be alerted at a specified time.  Synchronization  Two files of MyNotex can be kept synchronized. Thus, changes made to one file will result in changes to the other during the process of synchronization. All types of changes are tracked (new, changed and deleted subjects, notes and attachments). Files can therefore be modified offline and then be updated via a local network or the Internet (for instance through a cloud service). MyNotex can be set to perform automatic synchronization when a file is opened or closed.  Technical design  MyNotex is written in Object Pascal and is developed using Lazarus. It runs on GNU/LinuxDeveloped using Lazarus, it could theoretically be compiled for Windows and Mac OS too. and is compiled for GNOME. MyNotex stores notes in a SQLite database, but attachments (any type of file format) are compressed and saved in a folder in the same location as the database.

LMI Code The LMI code (List of the Historical Monuments code) identifies uniquely an historical monument or archaeological site, and includes, in this order: * Romanian county code, using ISO 3166-2:RO * A Roman numeral indicating the type of monument: ** I: archaeological ** II: architectural ** III: public monuments (e. g. statues) ** IV: memorials and gravestones * A lowercase letter: m for an individual monument, a for an ensemble and s for an archaeological site * A capital letter: A for monuments of national interest, B for local interest * A five- digit serial number. If the site is part of an ensemble, this is indicated by a decimal point followed by 01, 02, and so forth. For example, IS-II-a-A-03806 is the LMI code for CetƒÉ»õuia Monastery. IS indicates the site is in Ia»ôi County. II indicates it is an architectural monument, a that it is an ensemble, A that it is of national interest, and 03806 is its unique code. The ensemble has six individual sites, so for instance the monastery's bell tower, the fifth site listed, has code IS-II-m-A-03806.05. Sites may also have a RAN Code, indicating they are part of the National Archaeological Record (Repertoriul Arheologic Na»õional), a register including sites with archaeological potential, sites where archaeological excavations have taken place or ruined archaeological sites.

Long considered to be one of his early works, it is now generally thought to have been written in the late 1620s. It was first published posthumously in 1638 under the pseudonym of Domingo Gonsales. The work is notable for its role in what was called the \\"new astronomy\\", the branch of astronomy influenced especially by Nicolaus Copernicus. Although Copernicus is the only astronomer mentioned by name, the book also draws on the theories of Johannes Kepler and William Gilbert. Godwin's astronomical theories were greatly influenced by Galileo Galilei's Sidereus Nuncius (1610), but unlike Galileo, Godwin proposes that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many parallels with Kepler's Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunari of 1634. Gonsales is a Spaniard forced to flee the country after killing a man in a duel. Having made his fortune in the East Indies, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers the gansa, a species of wild swan able to carry substantial loads, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting what appears to be a utopian paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain. Some critics consider The Man in the Moone, along with Kepler's Somnium, to be one of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book. Background and contexts Godwin, the son of Thomas Godwin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1578, from where he received his Bachelor of Arts (1581) and Master of Arts degrees (1584); after entering the church he gained his Bachelor (1594) and Doctor of Divinity (1596) degrees. He gained prominence (even internationally) in 1601 by publishing his Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the Christian Religion in this Island, which enabled his rapid rise in the church hierarchy. During his life, he was known as a historian. =Scientific advances and lunar speculation= Clockwise, from top left: Copernicus, Gilbert, Kepler, Galileo Godwin's book appeared in a time of great interest in the Moon and astronomical phenomena, and of important developments in celestial observation, mathematics and mechanics. The influence particularly of Nicolaus Copernicus led to what was called the \\"new astronomy\\"; Copernicus is the only astronomer Godwin mentions by name, but the theories of Johannes Kepler and William Gilbert are also discernible. Galileo Galilei's 1610 publication Sidereus Nuncius (usually translated as \\"The Sidereal Messenger\\") had a great influence on Godwin's astronomical theories, although Godwin proposes (unlike Galileo) that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many similarities between The Man in the Moone and Kepler's Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunaris of 1634 (\\"The Dream, or Posthumous Work on Lunar Astronomy\\"). Speculation on lunar habitation was nothing new in Western thought, but it intensified in England during the early 17th century: Philemon Holland's 1603 translation of Plutarch's Moralia introduced Greco-Roman speculation to the English vernacular, and poets including Edmund Spenser proposed that other worlds, including the Moon, could be inhabited. Such speculation was prompted also by the expanding geographical view of the world. The 1630s saw the publication of a translation of Lucian's True History (1634), containing two accounts of trips to the Moon, and a new edition of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, likewise featuring an ascent to the Moon. In both books the Moon is inhabited, and this theme was given an explicit religious importance by writers such as John Donne, who in Ignatius His Conclave (1611, with new editions in 1634 and 1635) satirised a \\"lunatic church\\" on the Moon founded by Lucifer and the Jesuits. Lunar speculation reached an acme at the end of the decade, with the publication of Godwin's The Man in the Moone (1638) and John Wilkins's The Discovery of a World in the Moone (also 1638, and revised in 1640). =Dating evidence= Frontispiece and title page of the second edition (1657), now with the pseudonym replaced by \\"F.G. B. of H.\\" (\\"Francis Godwin, Bishop of Hereford\\") Until Grant McColley, a historian of early Modern English literature, published his \\"The Date of Godwin's Domingo Gonsales\\" in 1937, it was thought that Godwin wrote The Man in the Moone relatively early in his life ‚Äì perhaps during his time at Christ Church from 1578 to 1584, or maybe even as late as 1603. But McColley proposed a much later date of 1627 or 1628, based on internal and biographical evidence. A number of ideas about the physical properties of the Earth and the Moon, including claims about \\"a secret property that operates in a manner similar to that of a loadstone attracting iron\\", did not appear until after 1620. And Godwin seems to borrow the concept of using a flock of strong, trained birds to fly Gonsales to the Moon from Francis Bacon's Sylva sylvarum (\\"Natural History\\"), published in July 1626. All this evidence supports McColley's dating of \\"1626‚Äì29, with the probable years of composition 1627‚Äì28\\", which is now generally accepted. William Poole, in his 2009 edition of The Man in the Moone, provides additional evidence for a later dating. Godwin, he argues, most likely got his knowledge of the Jesuit mission in China (founded in 1601) from a 1625 edition of Samuel Purchass Purchas his Pilgrimage. This book contains a redaction from Nicolas Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu (1615) (\\"Concerning the Christian expedition to China undertaken by the Society of Jesus\\"), itself the redaction of a manuscript by the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Poole also sees the influence of Robert Burton, who in the second volume of The Anatomy of Melancholy had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation (citing Galileo) or from space travel (Lucian). Appearing for the first time in the 1628 edition of the Anatomy is a section on planetary periods, which gives a period for Mars of three years ‚Äì had Godwin used William Gilbert's De Magnete (1600) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years. Finally, Poole points to what he calls a \\"genetic debt\\": while details on for instance the Martian period could have come from a few other sources, Burton and Godwin are the only two writers of the time to combine an interest in alien life with the green children of Woolpit, from a 12th-century account of two mysterious green children found in Suffolk. One of Godwin's \\"major intellectual debts\\" is to Gilbert's De Magnete, in which Gilbert argued that the Earth was magnetic, though he may have used a derivative account by Mark Ridley or a geographical textbook by Nathanael Carpenter. It is unlikely that Godwin could have gathered first-hand evidence used in narrating the events in his book (such as the details of Gonsales's journey back from the East, especially a description of Saint Helena and its importance as a resting place for sick mariners), and more likely that he relied on travel adventures and other books. He used Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas (1615), based on a manuscript by Matteo Ricci, the founder of the Jesuit mission in Beijing in 1601, for information about that mission. Details pertaining to the sea voyage and Saint Helena likely came from Thomas Cavendish's account of his first circumnavigation of the world, available in Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1599‚Äì1600) and in Purchas His Pilgrimage, first published in 1613. Information on the Dutch Revolt, the historical setting for the early part of Gonsales' career, likely came from the annals of Emanuel van Meteren, a Dutch historian working in London. =English editions and translations= Frontispiece of Der Fliegende Wandersmann nach dem Mond, 1659 McColley knew of only one surviving copy of the first edition, held at the British Museum (now British Library C.56.c.2), which was the basis for his 1937 edition of The Man in the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, an edition criticised by literary critic Kathleen Tillotson as lacking in textual care and consistency. H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson. For the text of his 2009 edition, William Poole collated a copy in the Bodleian Library Oxford (Ashm. 940(1)) with that in the British Library. The printer of the first edition of The Man in the Moone is identified on the title page as John Norton, and the book was sold by Joshua Kirton and Thomas Warren. It also includes an epistle introducing the work and attributed to \\"E. M.\\", perhaps the fictitious Edward Mahon identified in the Stationers' Register as the translator from the original Spanish. Poole speculates that this Edward Mahon might be Thomas or Morgan Godwin, two of the bishop's sons who had worked with their father on telegraphy, but adds that Godwin's third son, Paul, might be involved as well. The partial revision of the manuscript (the first half has dates according to the Gregorian calendar, the second half still follows the superseded Julian calendar) indicates an unfinished manuscript, which Paul might have acquired after his father's death and passed on to his former colleague Joshua Kirton: Paul Godwin and Kirton were apprenticed to the same printer, John Bill, and worked there together for seven years. Paul may have simply continued the \\"E. M.\\" hoax unknowingly, and/or may have been responsible for partial revision of the manuscript. To the second edition, published in 1657, was added Godwin's Nuncius Inanimatus (in English and Latin; first published in 1629). The third edition was published in 1768; its text was abridged, and a description of St Helena (by printer Nathaniel Crouch) functioned as an introduction. A French translation by Jean Baudoin, L'Homme dans la Lune, was published in 1648, and republished four more times. This French version excised the narrative's sections on Lunar Christianity, as so do the many translations based on it, including the German translation incorrectly ascribed to Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen, Der fliegende Wandersmann nach dem Mond, 1659. Johan van Brosterhuysen (c. 1594‚Äì1650) translated the book into Dutch, and a Dutch translation ‚Äì possibly Brosterhuysen's, although the attribution is uncertain ‚Äì went through seven printings in the Netherlands between 1645 and 1718. The second edition of 1651 and subsequent editions include a continuation of unknown authorship relating Gonsales' further adventures. Plot summary The story is written as a first-person narrative from the perspective of Domingo Gonsales, the book's fictional author. In his opening address to the reader the equally fictional translator \\"E. M.\\" promises \\"an essay of Fancy, where Invention is shewed with Judgment\\". Gonsales is a citizen of Spain, forced to flee to the East Indies after killing a man in a duel. There he prospers by trading in jewels, and having made his fortune decides to return to Spain. On his voyage home he becomes seriously ill, and he and a negro servant Diego are put ashore on St Helena, a remote island with a reputation for \\"temperate and healthful\\" air. A scarcity of food forces Gonsales and Diego to live some miles apart, but Gonsales devises a variety of systems to allow them to communicate. Eventually he comes to rely on a species of bird he describes as some kind of wild swan, a gansa, to carry messages and provisions between himself and Diego. Gonsales gradually comes to realise that these birds are able to carry substantial burdens, and resolves to construct a device by which a number of them harnessed together might be able to support the weight of a man, allowing him to move around the island more conveniently. Following a successful test flight he determines to resume his voyage home, hoping that he might \\"fill the world with the Fame of [his] Glory and Renown\\". But on his way back to Spain, accompanied by his birds and the device he calls his Engine, his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife and he is forced to escape by taking to the air. After setting down briefly on Tenerife, Gonsales is forced to take off again by the imminent approach of hostile natives. But rather than flying to a place of safety among the Spanish inhabitants of the island the gansas fly higher and higher. On the first day of his flight Gonsales encounters \\"illusions of 'Devils and Wicked Spirits in the shape of men and women, some of whom he is able to converse with. They provide him with food and drink for his journey and promise to set him down safely in Spain if only he will join their \\"Fraternity\\", and \\"enter into such Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Master, whom they would not name\\". Gonsales declines their offer, and after a journey of 12 days reaches the Moon. Suddenly feeling very hungry he opens the provisions he was given en route, only to find nothing but dry leaves, goat's hair and animal dung, and that his wine \\"stunk like Horse-piss\\". He is soon discovered by the inhabitants of the Moon, the Lunars, whom he finds to be tall Christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise. Gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children. The Lunars speak a language consisting \\"not so much of words and letters as tunes and strange sounds\\", which Gonsales succeeds in gaining some fluency in after a couple of months. Six months or so after his arrival Gonsales becomes concerned about the condition of his gansas, three of whom have died. Fearing that he may never be able to return to Earth and see his children again if he delays further, he decides to take leave of his hosts, carrying with him a gift of precious stones from the supreme monarch of the Moon, Irdonozur. The stones are of three different sorts: Poleastis, which can store and generate great quantities of heat; Macbrus, which generates great quantities of light; and Ebelus, which when one side of the stone is clasped to the skin renders a man weightless, or half as heavy again if the other side is touched. Gonsales harnesses his gansas to his Engine and leaves the Moon on 29 March 1601. He lands in China about nine days later, without re-encountering the illusions of men and women he had seen on his outward journey and with the help of his Ebelus, which helps the birds to avoid plummeting to Earth as the weight of Gonsales and his Engine threatens to become too much for them. He is quickly arrested and taken before the local mandarin, accused of being a magician, and as a result is confined in the mandarin's palace. He learns to speak the local dialect of Chinese, and after some months of confinement is summoned before the mandarin to give an account of himself and his arrival in China, which gains him the mandarin's trust and favour. Gonsales hears of a group of Jesuits, and is granted permission to visit them. He writes an account of his adventures, which the Jesuits arrange to have sent back to Spain. The story ends with Gonsales's fervent wish that he may one day be allowed to return to Spain, and \\"that by enriching my country with the knowledge of these hidden mysteries, I may at least reap the glory of my fortunate misfortunes\\". Themes =Religion= The story is set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, a period of religious conflict in England. Not only was there the threat of a Catholic resurgence but there were also disputes within the Protestant Church. When Gonsales first encounters the Lunars he exclaims \\"Jesu Maria\\", at which the Lunars fall to their knees, but although they revere the name of Jesus they are unfamiliar with the name Maria, suggesting that they are Protestants rather than Catholics; Poole is of the same opinion: \\"their lack of reaction to the name of Mary suggests that they have not fallen into the errors of the Catholic Church, despite some otherwise rather Catholic-looking institutions on the moon\\". Beginning in the 1580s, when Godwin was a student at Oxford University, many publications criticising the governance of the established Church of England circulated widely, until in 1586 censorship was introduced, resulting in the Martin Marprelate controversy. Martin Marprelate was the name used by the anonymous author or authors of the illegal tracts attacking the Church published between 1588 and 1589. A number of commentators, including Grant McColley, have suggested that Godwin strongly objected to the imposition of censorship, expressed in Gonsales's hope that the publication of his account may not prove \\"prejudicial to the Catholic faith\\". John Clark has suggested that the Martin Marprelate controversy may have inspired Godwin to give the name Martin to the Lunars' god, but as a bishop of the Church of England it is perhaps unlikely that he was generally sympathetic to the Martin Marprelate position. Critics do not agree on the precise denomination of Godwin's Lunars. In contrast with Clark and Poole, David Cressy argues that the Lunars falling to their knees after Gonsales's exclamation (a similar ritual takes place at the court of Irdonozur) is evidence of \\"a fairly mechanical form of religion (as most of Godwin's Protestant contemporaries judged Roman Catholicism)\\". By the time The Man in the Moone was published, discussion on the plurality of worlds had begun to favour the possibility of extraterrestrial life. For Christian thinkers such a plurality is intimately connected to Christ and his redemption of man: if there are other worlds, do they share a similar history, and does Christ also redeem them in his sacrifice? According to Philipp Melanchthon, a 16th-century theologian who worked closely with Martin Luther, \\"It must not be imagined that there are many worlds, because it must not be imagined that Christ died or was resurrected more often, nor must it be thought that in any other world without the knowledge of the son of God, that men would be restored to eternal life\\". Similar comments were made by Calvinist theologian Lambert Daneau. Midway through the 17th century the matter appears to have been settled in favour of a possible plurality, which was accepted by Henry More and Aphra Behn among others; \\"by 1650, the Elizabethan Oxford examination question an sint plures mundi? ('can these be many worlds?' ‚Äì to which the correct Aristotelian answer was 'no') had been replaced by the disputation thesis quod Luna sit habitabilis ('that the moon could be habitable' ‚Äì which might be answered 'probably' if not 'yes')\\". =Lunar language= Transcription of lunar language, from the 1659 German edition Godwin had a lifelong interest in language and communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), and this was the topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, Fran√ßois Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel. One of Godwin's sources for his Lunar language was Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas. Gonsales provides two examples of spoken phrases, written down in a cipher later explained by John Wilkins in Mercury, or The Secret and Swift Messenger (1641). Trigault's account of the Chinese language gave Godwin the idea of assigning tonality to the Lunar language, and of appreciating it in the language spoken by the Chinese mandarins Gonsales encounters after his return to Earth. Gonsales claims that in contrast to the multitude of languages in China (making their speakers mutually unintelligible), the mandarins' language is universal by virtue of tonality (he suppresses it in the other varieties of Chinese). Thus the mandarins are able to maintain a cultural and spiritual superiority resembling that of the Lunar upper class, which is to be placed in contrast with the variety of languages spoken in a fractured and morally degenerate Europe and elsewhere. Knowlson argues that using the term \\"language\\" is overstating the case, and that cipher is the proper term: \\"In spite of Godwin's claims, this musical 'language' is not in fact a language at all, but simply a cipher in which the letters of an existing language may be transcribed\\". He suggests Godwin's source may have been a book by Joan Baptista Porta, whose De occultis literarum notis (1606) contains \\"an exact description of the method he was to adopt\\". Genre The book's genre has been variously categorised. When it was first published the literary genre of utopian fantasy was in its infancy, and critics have recognised how Godwin used a utopian setting to criticise the institutions of his time: the Moon was \\"the ideal perspective from which to view the earth\\" and its \\"moral attitudes and social institutions,\\" according to Maurice Bennett. Other critics have referred to the book as \\"utopia\\", \\"Renaissance utopia\\" or \\"picaresque adventure\\". While some critics claim it as one of the first works of science fiction, there is no general agreement that it is even \\"proto-science- fiction\\". Early commentators recognised that the book is a kind of picaresque novel, and comparisons with Don Quixote were being made as early as 1638. In structure as well as content The Man in the Moone somewhat resembles the anonymous Spanish novella Lazarillo de Tormes (1554); both books begin with a genealogy and start out in Salamanca, featuring a man who travels from master to master seeking his fortune. But most critics agree that the picaresque mode is not sustained throughout, and that Godwin intentionally achieves a \\"generic transformation\\". Godwin's book follows a venerable tradition of travel literature that blends the excitement of journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's Utopia is cited as a forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci. Godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing. Reception and influence The Man in the Moone was published five months after The Discovery of a World in the Moone by John Wilkins, later bishop of Chester. Wilkins refers to Godwin once, in a discussion of spots in the Moon, but not to Godwin's book. In the third edition of The Discovery (1640), however, Wilkins provides a summary of Godwin's book, and later in Mercury (1641) he comments on The Man in the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, saying that \\"the former text could be used to unlock the secrets of the latter\\". The Man in the Moone quickly became an international \\"source of humour and parody\\": Cyrano de Bergerac, using Baudoin's 1648 translation, parodied it in L'Autre Monde: o√π les √âtats et Empires de la Lune (1657); Cyrano's traveller actually meets Gonsales, who is still on the Moon, \\"degraded to the status of pet monkey\\". It was one of the inspirations for what has been called the first science fiction text in the Americas, Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures Aligned to the Meridian of M√©rida of the Yucat√°n by an Anctitone or Inhabitant of the Moon ... by Manuel Antonio de Rivas (1775). The Laputan language of Jonathan Swift, who was a distant relation of Godwin's, may have been influenced by The Man in the Moone, either directly or through Cyrano de Bergerac. The Man in the Moone became a popular source for \\"often extravagantly staged comic drama and opera\\", including Aphra Behn's The Emperor of the Moon, a 1687 play \\"inspired by ... the third edition of [The Man in the Moone], and the English translation of Cyrano's work\\", and Elkanah Settles The World in the Moon (1697). Thomas D'Urfeys Wonders in the Sun, or the Kingdom of the Birds (1706) was \\"really a sequel, starring Domingo and Diego\\". Its popularity was not limited to English; a Dutch farce, Don Domingo Gonzales of de Man in de maan, formerly considered to have been written by Maria de Wilde, was published in 1755. The book's influence continued into the 19th century. Edgar Allan Poe in an appendix to \\"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall\\" called it \\"a singular and somewhat ingenious little book\\". Poe assumed the author to be French, an assumption also made by Jules Verne in his From the Earth to the Moon (1865), suggesting that they may have been using Baudoin's translation. H. G. Wells's The First Men in the Moon (1901) has several parallels with Godwin's fantasy, including the use of a stone to induce weightlessness. But The Man in the Moone has nevertheless been given only \\"lukewarm consideration in different histories of English literature\\", and its importance is downplayed in studies of Utopian literature. Frank E. Manuel and Fritzie P. Manuel's Utopian Thought in the Western World (winner of the 1979 National Book Award for Nonfiction) mentions it only in passing, saying that Godwin \\"treats primarily of the mechanics of flight with the aid of a crew of birds\\", and that The Man in the Moone, like Bergerac's and Wilkins's books, lacks \\"high seriousness and unified moral purpose\\". Gonsales's load-carrying birds have also left their mark. The Oxford English Dictionarys entry for gansa reads \\"One of the birds (called elsewhere 'wild swans') which drew Domingo Gonsales to the Moon in the romance by Bp. F. Godwin\\". For the etymology it suggests ganz√¶, found in Philemon Holland's 1601 translation of Pliny the Elders Natural History. Michael van Langren (\\"Langrenus\\"), the 17th-century Dutch astronomer and cartographer, named one of the lunar craters for them, Gansii, later renamed Halley.

Design and development The powerplant for IAR 12, was an IAR LD 450 12-cylinder W-form watercooled in-line built under licience Lorraine-Dietrich 12 Eb, that offered 450 h.p. (336 kW) at 1,900 r.p.m., similar to the type fitted to the first C.V. 11. However, due to the increased aerodynamic drag, the maximum speed at ground level decreased to 294 km/h. This unsatisfactory result, combined with poor handling characteristics experienced during early test flights, constrained Carafoli to improve the construction and try a new engine. The new project, called I.A.R. 13, was essentially similar to the abandoned '12', except for the fin-and-rudder. Its surface had been reduced and instead of a rounded shape it became oval. The fuselage, wings and the anti-crash pylon had all been retained, while the undercarriage suffered minor changes. The engine fitted to the airframe was a Hispano-Suiza 12Mc of 500 h.p. (373 kW) output at 2,200 r.p.m. that operated a two-blade, all-metal Ratier propeller. The more powerful engine helped to boost the top speed to 330 km/h, which meant a significant 12% increase.

They are also known as Saifi which denotes the Muslim sub- caste of blacksmiths and carpenters. A small number are also found in the Terai region of Nepal. The community is also sometimes referred to as Multani.People of India Uttar Pradesh, Volume XLII Part One, edited by A Hasan & J C Das, pp. 190-193. Origin The community derive their name from the word barhai, which means carpenter in Hindi. According to their own traditions, they are descended from early Muslim settlers to India. It is however likely, that they are converts from the Barhai caste. In Uttar Pradesh, the Barhai or Saifi have two sub-divisions, the Desi or native and the Multani or immigrants from Multan. Each of these two groups in endogamous. They are found mainly in the Doab and Rohilkhand regions, and speak the Khari boli dialect. The community has been granted Other Backward Class status. The term Saifi refers to Sword makers during medieval times. Present circumstances The Behna are no longer mainly employed mainly as carpenters, and many work in farming. They are largely small and medium sized farmers, although a sizeable number are agricultural labourers, and live in multi caste and multi religious settlements, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Each settlement has a caste council, known as a panchayat, which acts as an instrument of social control. It deals with intra community disputes, as well as punishing those who breach communal norms. Although they live in close proximity to other Muslim groups, such as the Shaikh, Gaddi, Ansari, Rajput Muslim and Qassab in Doab, and the Muslim Teli, Muslim Banjara, Baghban and Rohilla in Rohilkhand, there is very little interaction, and virtually no intermarriage. The only group with which close relations are maintained are the Saifi, and this includes intermarriage. With regards to neighbouring Hindu groups such the Jat and Gujjar, a social distance is maintained. The Barhai are Sunni Muslim of the Barelvi & Deobandi sect. They speak Urdu, and various dialects of Hindi. There customs are similar to other Uttar Pradesh Muslims.People of India Uttar Pradesh, Volume XLII Part One, edited by A Hasan & J C Das, p. 243.

The game was released worldwide on December 20, 2010. The game optionally utilizes the Mega CD expansion device to enhance its audio capabilities.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=774473165953696  Plot  = Setting = The story is focused around three best friends ‚Äî Hoston, Alina and Edessot. Hoston's father falls ill and the three friends are left to seek a rare magic herb to cure him. This story later develops into a much larger plot surrounding Pier Solar and the Great Architects. = Characters = * Hoston is a young botanist, taught by his father. He is a carefree laid- back young man. When his father becomes dangerously ill, Hoston realises that he is the only person who can save him and heads for the forbidden caverns of Reja where he hopes to find the herbs that will save his father's life. * Alina was adopted at a young age. She grew up with Hoston and Edessot as her only friends and is desperately trying to get her father to approve of her. Even though she is superficially strong and responsible, she turns out to be lonely at heart, because she feels that Hoston and Edessot are the only people who truly care about her. She is protective of them and in many ways considers them to be her real family, though neither Hoston nor Edessot understand this. * Edessot is a mechanics genius and mature beyond his years. He is part of a wealthy and liberally-minded family, and has been free to explore the world to his heart's content. Usually happier alone and tinkering with machines, he still likes spending time with Hoston and Alina, having formed a particularly strong bond with the latter. = Story =  Development and release  Cover for Sega Dreamcast release (2015). This cover is styled just like a retail PAL Dreamcast game. Artwork by Armen M. Development of the game began on June 8, 2004 as a small project by the community of the website Eidolon's Inn, a community dedicated to homebrew-development for Sega video game consoles. The project was originally intended to be a simple RPG based on the members of the community, and the target platform was the Mega CD. At that time the project was simply called Tavern RPG, a reference to the website's message boards being called \\"The Tavern\\". As development progressed the original idea was abandoned in favor of a full-fledged fantasy RPG of greater scale. By 2006 the game engine had become sophisticated enough that the creation of actual content could really begin. While most of the Eidolon's Inn community was no longer directly involved, other people joined the team, leading to a core of eight members with additional help from many more. Goals for the game became ever more ambitious, with the development being switched from the Mega-CD, for which CD-ROMs would have been inexpensive to produce, to the Sega Megadrive, a system using more expensive cartridge-based storage media. To allow for the transition without having to reduce the amount of game content, it was decided to use a cartridge with 64 megabits of memory, making it technically the \\"Biggest\\" game cartridge for the system, while finding a way to utilize the superior sound hardware of the Mega-CD at the same time if the device was present. The game was announced in a developer's blog with the launch of a website shortly after revealing the game's final title in January 2008. A demo was released later the same year to play on emulators, with pre-orders starting at the same time. A release at Christmas 2008 was announced. The game got considerable media attention for a homebrew title during the following months, with the UK magazine Retro Gamer featuring a two-page article in issue 49 and numerous websites reporting on it. However this release date was not met, the developers citing the departure of a team member who had contributed essential graphics to the game, and his wish not to have his work used in the final version as the main reason. The delay was announced on November 14, 2008, but no new release date was given. Still media attention remained steady, with Germany's longest running print video game magazine M! Games and UK magazine Games TM reporting. The game was shipped in December 2010, two years after the originally intended release date. Three different versions of the game have been released: Classic, Posterity and Reprint. The Classic and Posterity editions each have three different language packs, while the Reprint features the three most common European languages: English, French and German. The Japanese language pack originally included Japanese and English languages but the Japanese language was dropped and French and Spanish included due to a lack of volunteers to proofread the Japanese translation. Even prior to the game's official release date, the game had already sold out through pre- orders. Due to overwhelming demand, WaterMelon decided to produce a second, also limited, run with a so-called \\"Reprint Edition\\", which sold out in 12 days. WaterMelon announced the production of additional copies on Thursday, September 15, 2011. The third and final forecast re-print of the Mega Drive/Genesis cartridge was due to be released on March 25, 2014. It had yet to happen, but Watermelon has assured fans they will be ready for late April/early May. However, this release date was not met either. This reprint edition finally started shipping to customers in late February 2015. = Pier Solar HD = On November 5, 2012, the game's developer WaterMelon announced on its Kickstarter page that it was developing the game for Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux and Sega Dreamcast. Later in the same month, WaterMelon elaborated their project further, additionally opening an opportunity to make the game available in Japanese, and to release the game on Android platforms, Ouya and Wii U. Early in the following December, the Kickstarter page successfully surpassed the project's minimum donation goal, and assured game's release on Wii U, which had the highest required stretch. On November 15, 2013, it was announced that the Xbox 360 version was currently delayed, and the game will come to both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in March 2014. WaterMelon announced their studio's acceptance into Microsoft's Xbox One developer program on December 4, 2013, as well as their intention to publish Pier Solar HD on the console. In February 2014 it was announced that Pier Solar HD had been delayed again and is now expected to be released in Q2 2014. On August 19 it was announced that Pier Solar HD is in certification and will be released as a cross-buy title for PS4 and PS3 on September 30 and as of October 2 PS Vita. The Dreamcast version was the last one to be released on November 27, 2015, the reason for the delay was that unlike the digital releases, the DC version had it to be completely bug tested as it couldn't be patched.http://www.dreamcast-scene.com/games/pier-solar/ On March 20, 2016, the game's developer WaterMelon announced, through an email conversation,http://i.imgur.com/8XtHu7F.png?1title=First Email Conversation Directly with WaterMelonhttp://i.imgur.com/vle8AaT.png that the PS Vita port of Pier Solar has been cancelled.

Reception  Reviews of Pier Solar and the Great Architects were mixed. While its presentation was widely praised, reception to the gameplay was average. Bradly Halestorm of Hardcore Gamer praised the game's use of a \\"vibrant color palette\\" and its \\"strong art direction\\", calling the game \\"one hell of a roleplaying experience\\". Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan said that the game's graphics, music and atmosphere were \\"fantastic\\", but felt that the actual gameplay was too frustrating, noting what he perceived as a \\"labyrinthine\\" design in many areas. He also described parts of the game's combat as \\"tedious and repetitive\\", citing \\"lengthy\\" animations and \\"high difficulty\\" as reasons. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer concluded that the game was \\"unlikely to appeal to many people weaned on more recent generations of RPGs\\", adding that \\"those with a more retro mindset will find some enjoyment\\". The game's soundtrack received widespread acclaim. Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan called it \\"catchy\\" and noted that it helped \\"[augment] the game's atmosphere\\". Joe Juba of Game Informer said that the soundtrack helped in achieving an \\"authentic 16-bit\\" look, calling it \\"absolutely fantastic\\". Bradly Halestorm of Hardcore Gamer called it \\"a triumph\\" and added that it managed to \\"convey strong emotions\\" with \\"beautifully arranged\\" compositions.

The band incorporates various influences into its sound, including English folk, progressive rock, Indian classical, and heavy metal. Jurojin is notable in its field for counting among its members a classically trained Tabla player. The 2010 launch of Jurojin's first mini-album, The Living Measure of Time, has seen the band favoured by critics for balancing musically and rhythmically complex compositions with a distinctly accessible sound.  History  Jurojin began recording its first songs shortly after its formation in 2008, which would later appear on their first release The Living Measure of Time. In late 2009 the band formed their own record label Majestic Elder Recordings and signed an international distribution deal with ADA/Warner which led to an initial release of the album in select territories on 7 June 2010. An update posted on their website in late 2010 has set the further release in all territories to 7 March 2011. The album has received favourable coverage and reviews across most media, with the UK's Kerrang! magazine calling it \\"one of the most unique albums of 2010\\", and Rock Sound magazine lauding its \\"display of maturity far in excess of the band‚Äôs apparent experience\\". Multiple tracks off The Living Measure of Time have been played on commercial radio, most notably on BBC Radio 1 in the UK and Triple J in Australia. Music Jurojin occasionally perform a variety of acoustic shows, during which the band focuses primarily on its Eastern and acoustic influences that prominently feature the Tabla. In an interview with TotalRock radio in the UK, guitarist Nicolas Rizzi stated that though some of their album tracks feature in these sets, the bulk of songs performed tend to be primarily acoustic songs and never feature in their heavy sets. These are sometimes instrumental, with expanded or reduced lineups and various guest musicians. 2009 Barbican performance with Virpal Ghalley beatboxing. = Discography = * The Living Measure of Time (2010)  Members  * Nicolas Rizzi - Guitars * Yves Fernandez - Bass * Simran Ghalley - Tabla * James Alper - Vocals * Francesco Lucidi - Drums Jurojin have recently collaborated with acclaimed violinist Anna Phoebe of Jethro Tull and Trans-Siberian Orchestra fame, and she can often be seen performing with the band at select live gigs.

During the Christmas period, Martin shockingly discovered that Rebecca was staying at Carol's home. He tried visiting her for Christmas, but after seeing her kissing another bloke, he left. Zoe Tattersall Zoe Tattersall, played by Joanne Froggatt, made her first screen appearance on 19 May 1997. Jane Danson and Georgia Taylor auditioned for the role of Zoe, before being cast as the Battersby sisters, Leanne and Toyah. Zoe is a troubled teenage tearaway. She has enough of children's care homes and runs away, living on the streets with her boyfriend, Liam Shepherd. The character first appears in the amusement arcade where Judy Mallett (Gaynor Faye) works. Liam causes trouble and one day Gary (Ian Mercer) throws the teenager out but he decides to blackmail the Malletts, threatening to go to the police. They need money as Zoe is pregnant. Judy, struggling with fertility issues, offers Zoe ¬£2,000 if she will allow her and Gary to adopt her baby. Zoe is overwhelmed but accepts the offer, despite Gary's objection. The neighbours assume that Gary is the baby's father and Judy allows them to think that, deciding it would help if anyone asked why they had the baby. Zoe soon makes friends with Leanne Battersby and tells her the real story, including the payment. The baby arrives and Judy wants Zoe to move on as she is showing signs of bonding with little Katy Joyce. Gary fraudulently signs the birth certificate as the father and Judy settles into new motherhood with Zoe resentfully looking on in the background. After the health visitor‚Äôs first visit, Zoe is persuaded to leave but the Malletts tell people that Zoe stole some money and ran away but Leanne tells Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickitt) the truth. Leanne finds Zoe and persuades her to come back and clear her name. Meanwhile, Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold), working in the corner shop, develops feelings for Zoe. Finally, after the christening, Gary and Judy are so worried about Zoe that they plan to leave Weatherfield but Zoe snatches her baby with Ashley‚Äôs help, renaming her Shannon. Zoe and Shannon move in with Ashley, Leanne and Nick and live together until Shannon is rushed to hospital with meningitis and dies. Zoe is devastated and has a breakdown, lashing out at her friends and neighbours, resulting in her being sectioned for a while. During this time, Ashley realizes that though he loves Zoe, he cannot give her what she needs but won‚Äôt finish with her. When she is released from hospital, she comes back to live with him. Zoe meets a couple while out clubbing, Ben and Ruth. Ruth becomes her new best friend very quickly, making Ashley suspicious. They get Zoe a job at their \\"Foundation\\" and convince her to sell new age crystals on the street and door to door, while telling her about their beliefs and taking advantage of her grief for her baby. She is soon convinced that theirs is the road to salvation and becomes deeply involved in the Cult of Nirab. Despite his efforts, Ashley realises that Zoe has to make her own decisions. She needs a new start, wants to have a baby for the Foundation and leaves with Ben and Ruth in December 1998 and is never seen again. Years later Ashley mentions Zoe in conversation with wife, Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth), mentioning that she now lives in America. Jon Lindsay Jon Lindsay, played by Owen Aaronovitch, made his first screen appearance on 28 May 1997. Aaronovitch received the role after an audition. He later left the show to move to Spain with his wife. Paul Baldwin of The People praised the character, saying \\"Jon Lindsay is one of the scriptwriters' most intriguing characters for years.\\" He also described Jon as a \\"love rat\\", \\"smooth-talking\\", a \\"slimeball\\" and a \\"creepy conman\\". Jon meets Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride) at a singles night. He tells her he is a divorcee and an airline pilot. They spend more time together and start dating. While Ken Barlow (William Roache) is at Manchester Airport, he sees Jon working in a tie shop. Jon tells Deirdre that he had been forced to retire from his pilots job and was ashamed to admit that he now worked in a shop. Deirdre believes him, but Ken remains suspicious. Jon expresses his desire to live with Deirdre after he mentions his ex-wife has sold their house. They soon move in together. It emerges that Jon has stolen the identity of his friend Captain Ian Jenkins (Stephen Chapman) and still lives with his wife and children. He tells Deirdre that he needs to spend more time away due to a promotion. Jon and Deirdre get engaged, but she finds out about his wife and confronts him at his home. He denies knowing her. Jon applies for a credit card and a mortgage using a false identity, which he later signs into Deirdre's name. When the police question him, Jon lets Deirdre take the blame. He receives a suspended sentence, while Deirdre is charged and later sentenced to eighteen months in prison for fraud. When Mary Docherty (Victoria Alcock), a woman Jon had also duped, reads about Deirdre's trial, she comes forward and reveals that Jon is also a bigamist, having married her.

Leanne Battersby Leanne Anika Battersby, played by Jane Danson, made her first appearance on 4 July 1997. Danson left the series in 2000 and returned in 2004. Danson later took maternity leave in 2006 and returned in early 2007. Danson took another maternity break in 2009 and returned on the same year. Leanne's storylines include numerous affairs, prostitution, drug-abuse, insurance fraud, discovering her biological mother was Stella Price (Michelle Collins), a miscarriage, an abortion, and a custody battle for her step-son, Simon. Leanne has had numerous relationships within the show. She married Nick Tilsley in 1998, but they divorced a year later. She later married Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) in the show's live 50th anniversary episode, but later split from him, after his affair with Carla Connor (Alison King) was exposed. After a volatile reconciliation, she and Nick married for the second time in January 2013. In late January 2014, Nick decided it was best for them to be apart, as he was suffering with long-term brain damage.

Toyah Battersby Toyah Laverne Battersby, played by Georgia Taylor, made her first screen appearance on 1997. The character and her family were created and introduced by executive producer Brian Park in a bid to increase falling ratings. Taylor was cast as the youngest member of the family, Toyah, and the role marked her acting debut. The actress described her character as being \\"gobby and cocky\\" and said that she often makes her parents' lives a misery. Charlie Catchpole from the Daily Mirror's commented that Toyah went \\"from lumpy, sulky schoolgirl to confident, radiant young woman\\" during her time in the show. Les Battersby Shannon Tattersall Shannon Jade Tattersall (Formerly Katie Mallett) was the daughter of wayward teenager Zoe Tattersall (Joanne Froggatt) and Liam Shepherd (Andrew Knott). Zoe fell pregnant by her ex-boyfriend; she did not want to be a mother and was planning to have the pregnancy terminated, but Judy Mallett (Gaynor Faye) - who was unable to have children - convinced her not to. Zoe then offered the Malletts ¬£2,000 for her baby, and Judy hastily took the offer with a reluctant Gary Mallett (Ian Mercer) going on with the plan as well. After drinking alcohol, Zoe gave birth to a baby girl by cesarean section prematurely in August 1997; Gary was present at the birth. He and Judy named the baby Katie Joyce Mallett, with her middle name being named after Judy‚Äôs mother Joyce Smedley (Anita Carey), who was killed in a road accident months before. Both Judy and Zoe agreed that Gary must say he was Katie‚Äôs father, so they do not raise suspision with the residents. Over time, Zoe began to change her mind about Katie being raised by the Malletts, so she admitted to new friend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) about selling her baby, and the mouthy teen confronted the Malletts, who accused Zoe of running away with the money. The young mother was left devastated when, after baby Katie‚Äôs christening, the Malletts considered moving away from the street to keep the baby away from her. Meanwhile, Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) developed feelings for Zoe and helped her snatch her baby back, and Zoe renamed her Shannon Jade. In April 1998, Zoe was left devastated when her baby daughter tragically died of meningitis aged just eight months. After Shannon's death, Zoe hit out at the people closest to her, eventually leading to her being sectioned. She was later thought to have moved to America.

Extremely destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, Brazil and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also appear regularly in neighboring southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer season, and somewhat regularly in Europe, Asia, and Australia. There were 1,703 tornadoes confirmed in the United States in 2011. It was the second most active year on record, with only 2004 having more confirmed tornadoes. 2011 was an exceptionally destructive and deadly year for tornadoes; worldwide, at least 571 people perished due to tornadoes: 12 in Bangladesh, two in South Africa, one each in New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia and Canada, and 553 in the United States (compared to 564 deaths in the prior ten years combined). Due mostly to several extremely large tornado outbreaks in the middle and end of April and in late May, the year finished well above average in almost every category, with six EF5 tornadoes and nearly enough total tornado reports to eclipse the mark of 1,817 tornadoes recorded in 2004, the current record year for total number of tornadoes. The 553 confirmed fatalities marks the second-most tornadic deaths in a single year in U.S. history, behind only 1925 in terms of fatalities attributed to tornadic activity. Most of the damage and over two-thirds of the year's total fatalities were caused by a late-April Super Outbreak and an EF5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri in late-May. Synopsis Location of fatal tornadoes in the Contiguous United States during 2011 An ongoing outbreak at the end of 2010 continued into the first three hours of 2011. During that period seven tornadoes touched down in Mississippi. However, during the remainder of the month, tornadic activity was suppressed by a cold air mass, with nine additional tornadoes ‚Äì all weak ‚Äì taking place. This inactivity continued through much of February before a pattern shift. Two consecutive outbreaks took place on February 25 and 27 ‚Äì 28, producing a combined 55 tornadoes. Overall, 63 tornadoes were confirmed in the month, ranking it as the fourth- busiest February on record. Activity in March was split between the start and end of the month, with a total of 75 tornadoes touching down, which ran slightly above average for the month. In early April, a prolific severe weather event produced at least 42 tornadoes among more than 1,200 reports of wind damage, setting the tone for the month. A nearly continuous series of major tornado outbreaks followed thereafter in the remainder of April, including two extreme multi-day tornado outbreaks that were among the largest in U.S. history (one of them also one of the deadliest and the costliest) and two other large tornado outbreaks, and combined they resulted in an incredibly active month from start to finish; it was easily the most active month for tornadoes on record and by an extremely large margin the most active April, with over 765 tornadoes touching down. In an abrupt reversal, the activity did not continue into May (normally the most active month for tornadoes), however, and the first half was remarkably quiet and one of the least active Mays on record as of the middle of the month. That continued for three weeks until significant severe weather returned on May 21, and an extremely deadly tornado hit the following day in a major outbreak. The outbreak continued for the next several days, with over 180 confirmed touchdowns, bringing the month of May near average. The first day of June brought a rare outbreak into Massachusetts, where several tornadoes touched down, some of them fairly destructive. However, another reversal took place afterward and much of June was fairly quiet, with the exception of an active period in the third week that produced a moderate outbreak. July was also relatively quiet for the most part with below normal activity mostly clustered in the northern Plains. August was more quiet with below normal activity and only about 50 confirmed tornadoes. September and October were also below average. November was somewhat more active, primarily due to two moderate outbreaks in the first half of the month. December saw a return to inactivity for most of the month, but there was a small outbreak of 13 tornadoes on December 22 to close out the year. Events =United States yearly total= January There were 29 tornadoes reported in the US in January, of which 16 were confirmed. =January 1= A late-season deadly tornado outbreak continued through the early hours of January 1, with seven tornadoes touching down in Mississippi over three hours. The strongest of these, rated EF3 with winds of , reached in width along its track and caused significant damage along Mississippi Highway 19. Several structures were damaged or destroyed and two people were injured. Near Mississippi Highway 35, thousands of trees were uprooted by the tornado. Another EF3 touched down near Macon, damaging or destroying several structures and one person was injured. Overall damage in the state from tornadoes amounted to $10.4 million. =January 24‚Äì25 (Europe)= In late January, three tornadoes touched down in eastern Europe: two in Turkey and one in Greece. In Kemalpa≈üa, Turkey, an F1 tornado caused the wall of an industrial building to collapse. Several other structures sustained roof damage. The strongest of these tornadoes was an F2 that touched down in northern Rhodes, destroying small structures and killing several heads of cattle. Hail up to in diameter fell in some places, damaging farmland and greenhouses. Accumulations of hail also reached in Mersin Province, Turkey. February There were 61 tornadoes reported in the US in February, of which 68 were confirmed. The higher final total is due to a large number of late reports. In addition to the events listed below, there was an F2 tornado in Greece on February 23 that destroyed a restaurant and a brief, weak tornado associated with Cyclone Carlos which struck the town of Karratha in Western Australia. =February 24= Several tornadoes touched down across parts of the Southern United States. The most significant tornado was in the southeastern part of Nashville, Tennessee where significant damage was reported near Hickory Hollow Mall and near Percy Priest Lake in the evening (with widespread wind damage all across Middle Tennessee), and a tornado emergency was declared shortly thereafter for areas to the northeast in Wilson County where another tornado touched down with injuries. Both tornadoes were rated EF2. Other tornadoes touched down with varying degrees of damage in the Missouri Bootheel, West Tennessee, Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and parts of Arkansas including three others rated EF2.The overall damage from this system amounted to $1,500,000 =February 27‚Äì28= A home destroyed by an EF2 tornado in Dubois County, Indiana Another severe weather event developed on February 27 and continued into February 28 across the Midwest and South. While a large portion of the damage was due to damaging straight-line winds, at least 35 tornadoes were reported across several states. The most destructive tornado was in Franklin County, Tennessee on the afternoon of February 28 where one person was killed by an EF2 tornado. It was the first killer tornado of 2011. Another strong tornado, rated EF3, resulted in houses destroyed near Eminence, Kentucky. Concentrated tornado activity also occurred in parts of Missouri and Illinois with 22 tornadoes in the region, some as strong as EF2, related to a series of squall lines with many embedded tornadoes. None of those tornadoes resulted in any fatalities. Overall damages from this system amounted to $12,800,000. March There were 95 tornadoes reported in the US in March, of which 75 were confirmed. =March 5‚Äì6= One confirmed EF0 tornado hit the town of Crowley, Louisiana. Another reportedly hit Greene County, Mississippi on March 5. It formed in a squall line, which hit portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. A deadly EF2 tornado struck Rayne, Louisiana early that afternoon, killing a mother while she protected her daughter. At least 12 others were injured. Initial assessments indicate that 62 homes were destroyed and 50 more damaged. Two EF0 tornadoes were also confirmed in eastern North Carolina. =March 8‚Äì9= Several tornadoes touched down once again on March 8 into March 9 from North Texas eastward to the Florida Panhandle, with Louisiana hardest hit. The most destructive tornadoes, rated EF2, touched down just north of New Orleans in St. Tammany Parish. =March 21‚Äì23= A tornado developed in the afternoon of March 21 near Maxwell, California, and it crossed Interstate 5, but however caused no known damage, as it was on the ground for only a few minutes. The same system produced more severe weather ahead of a dry line across eastern Nebraska, where tornadoes were reported northeast of Omaha. Later, a cluster of supercells began producing tornadoes in south-central Iowa, where a tornado was reported in Greenfield, Iowa, and at least 2 tornadoes were reported near Winterset, Iowa. Several funnel clouds were reported in Des Moines, where there was a possible touchdown. These funnels were associated with the storm that produced the first tornado to hit Greenfield and Winterset. On March 23, more tornadoes and severe weather developed with the most significant tornadoes touching down in East Tennessee where significant damage was reported. Near Greenback in Blount County, an EF3 tornado was confirmed with severe damage in the area. Another notable tornado touched down in southwestern Pennsylvania, most notably in Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania. It was rated EF2. =March 29‚Äì31= Tampa. On March 29, a warm front over the Gulf of Mexico associated with an upper-level low over Texas moved northward into the Gulf Coast States, bringing scattered severe weather. In Louisiana, three tornadoes touched down, including an EF1 which caused a three-story building to collapse. In Mississippi, one person was killed after lightning caused a house fire. A strong microburst also took place in Copiah County, producing winds up to . Activity shifted into central Florida on March 30 as a frontal boundary stalled out across the state. During the two-day period, ten tornadoes touched down and a series of squall lines produced widespread wind damage on March 31. Significant damage took place in several communities and damage exceeded $5 million. Seven people were injured when one of the tornadoes hit a local festival. April There were 875 tornadoes reported in the United States in April, of which 771 were confirmed. That set a new all-time monthly record, significantly exceeding the previous record of 552 in May 2003 and nearly tripling the old record for April (267 in 1974). In Alabama, the monthly (for April) and yearly record was broken with 89 and 98 tornadoes respectively. =April 4‚Äì5= Several storms started to develop in the evening on April 3. Storms in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois brought severe thunderstorms to the areas. A tornado watch was issued for Iowa and Illinois as the storms rolled through, and later a severe thunderstorm watch for northeastern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin. However, there were no reported tornadoes. Continuing eastward, the system entered an environment favoring tornadic development. Two tornadoes were reported in Kentucky during the early afternoon, both rated EF2 and resulting in injuries. Near Hopkinsville, a tornado, confirmed by local emergency services, caused significant damage to a manufacturing plant. Numerous buildings were reported to be destroyed, trapping residents within debris. In addition to the tornadoes, there was widespread wind damage (over 1,400 severe weather reports were received by the Storm Prediction Center, with the vast majority being damaging winds) as an extremely large squall line/serial derecho tracked across the southern United States with wind gusts as high as 90 mph (145 km/h) reported across 20 states, killing at least 9 people, one of the deaths was as a result of an EF2 tornado in Dodge County, Georgia. Numerous power outages also took place due to the extensive wind damage. Nearly 100,000 and 147,000 residences lost power in Tennessee and Georgia respectively. =April 4 (Bangladesh)= During the afternoon of April 4, a powerful tornado struck seven districts in northern Bangladesh. At least 12 people were killed and more than 150 injured as the tornado destroyed hundreds of homes and uprooted large swaths of vegetation. =April 8‚Äì11= Damage from the EF3 Mapleton tornado A large storm system with an associated frontal boundary moved northward and eastward across the central United States beginning on April 8. While initial severe weather was limited, a lone supercell broke out ahead of a mesoscale convective system in Pulaski County, Virginia on the eastern end of the warm front that evening. Two tornadoes were confirmed, one of which was an EF2 that caused severe damage in Pulaski, Virginia. Numerous houses were damaged and eight people were injured. During the afternoon of April 9, supercells developed along the warm front and tracked through parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina, generating softball sized hail and eight more tornadoes. During the evening of April 9, several severe thunderstorms developed across Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. A single supercell became tornadic over extreme western Iowa, producing a family of ten tornadoes over the course of five hours. The first was wide and struck Mapleton, Iowa, destroying about 100 homes. Due to a 20-minute warning time, no fatalities took place and only 14 to 16 people were injured. Officials blocked off the town and Governor Terry Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for the town. Additional tornadic activity developed on April 10 across Wisconsin with several more tornadoes reported there. =April 14‚Äì16= The Tushka, Oklahoma tornado. During the afternoon of April 14, a significant tornado outbreak started setting up. A PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) tornado watch was issued for much of eastern Oklahoma. Supercells explosively developed over central Oklahoma. Storm chasers in the region reported several funnel clouds and two touchdowns, neither of which resulted in damage. Several tornadoes were confirmed through storm chaser video and local emergency management services. A large, intense, multiple-vortex tornado caused severe damage in the towns of Atoka and Tushka where many houses were destroyed or flattened. Numerous injuries were reported in the latter of these areas. Two people were killed and 25 more injured in Tushka. In Arkansas, 2 people were killed when an EF1 downed a tree which landed on a house. During the late- night hours into the morning of April 15, tornadic activity lessened. However, by the late morning hours, supercell thunderstorms developed again over parts of Mississippi, and tornadoes began to touch down again. A tornado emergency was declared for the northern Jackson metropolitan area as a result at shortly after 11:00 am CDT (1600 UTC). A destructive tornado moved across the area with severe damage and multiple injuries according to WLBT coverage. That afternoon, Mississippi State University spotters confirmed a large tornado in east-central Mississippi and west-central Alabama and another tornado emergency was issued. ABC 33/40 coverage reported that the tornado was 3/4 mile (1.2 km) in width. Over 90 tornado sightings were reported that day and at least eight people were killed in Mississippi and Alabama. On April 16, another PDS tornado watch, along with a \\"high risk\\" alert from the SPC were issued for central and eastern North Carolina. At least 24 died and 135 were seriously injured in what became North Carolina's worst tornado outbreak in 25 years; tornadoes also struck South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Twelve of the North Carolina deaths took place in Bertie County; tornado emergencies were issued for Raleigh, Snow Hill, and Wilson at the height of the outbreak. In North Carolina, twelve supercells produced at least 25 tornadoes, with at least 32 counties affected. A total of 21 businesses and 440 homes were destroyed, 63 of those homes in Raleigh; about 92 businesses and 6,189 homes suffered significant damage, 184 of those homes in Raleigh. =April 19‚Äì24= Yet another severe weather event developed across the Midwest and southern Great Plains on April 19 as another dynamic low pressure system tracked across the area. Thunderstorms began in the late afternoon and early evening with large hail and several tornadoes. Significant damage was reported near Bowling Green, Missouri and Girard, Illinois as a result of tornadoes, the latter of which was rated EF3. Another large tornado was reported near Octavia, Oklahoma before the supercells merged into a very large squall line. Overnight, the squall line tracked eastward with widespread wind damage and many embedded tornadoes across several states, a few as strong as EF2 but most were brief and weak. In the early hours of April 20, 2011, a tornado tore through a neighborhood in Oregon, Ohio leaving some significant damage and no injuries. Also, three tornadoes struck New Albany, Indiana, and Jeffersonville, Indiana. Both cities are just north of Louisville, Kentucky On April 22, the outbreak continued with several tornadoes causing damage in the Midwest, the most notable being a violent EF4 that struck St. Louis, Missouri, causing extensive damage. A few more tornadoes were reported on April 23‚Äì24, however most did not cause any severe damage, though one EF2 tornado caused structural damage in the town of Bardwell, Kentucky. Severe weather once again developed across parts of the Midwest on April 22. The hardest-hit area was parts of the St. Louis metropolitan area. A destructive tornado tracked across the region with severe damage in several communities including houses destroyed in communities such as Bridgeton, Ferguson, Florissant, Hazelwood, Maryland Heights and New Melle. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport was hard hit with severe damage to numerous facilities there and injuries reported. Windows were blown out of the terminals there and airplanes were flipped in the field. The airport has been closed as officials investigate the damage, but should be partially operational by the end of April 23 (the heavily damaged Concourse C reopened on April 2, 2012). The tornado was given a rating of EF4 based on finding of flattened houses in Bridgeton. Following assessments by the local National Weather Service, it was determined that a single tornado tracked for through parts of Missouri and Illinois, reaching a maximum width of . Elsewhere, there were several reported tornadoes, including an EF2 which tracked through Henderson, Webster and Union County. =April 25‚Äì28= The cyclone responsible for the historic outbreak on April 27 Between April 25 and 28, a historic tornado outbreak took place across much of the Southern United States as well as parts of the Midwest and Northeast. With 360 confirmed tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities, the outbreak ranks as the largest and one of the worst in United States history. More than three dozen tornadoes were confirmed each day of the event, with 42 on April 25, 55 on April 26, a 24-hour record of 216 on April 27, and 47 on April 28. In terms of violent tornadoes, the event ranks third with 15 EF4/5 storms, behind the 1974 Super Outbreak and 1965 Palm Sunday outbreak. A large outbreak was possible for April 25‚Äì27 as the SPC issued a moderate risk of severe weather for three consecutive days, centered over Arkansas through Tennessee. By the late-afternoon hours of April 25, several tornadoes had been reported across a few states, including two which caused significant damage in Oklahoma and Texas. At 3:25 pm CST (2025 UTC), the SPC issued a PDS tornado watch for much of Arkansas and parts of Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. Tornadoes were scattered that day until early evening, when an intense tornadic cell tracked near the Little Rock metropolitan area and a tornado emergency was declared for Vilonia, Arkansas. A wide EF2 tornado then caused extensive damage in Vilonia. At least four people are known to have died in the town with many more injured. Road surface stripped by an EF5 tornado near Philadelphia, Mississippi. On April 27, a large tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama, killing 44 people. The Tuscaloosa mayor called the damage \\"catastrophic.\\" The same tornado hit the northern suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, shortly thereafter, killing 20 more people. Television reporters in Birmingham, filming the tornado, reported that even from miles away, the funnel was so wide that they could not zoom their cameras out far enough to get the entire funnel into the frame at once. Over 200 tornadoes were reported during the SPC's reporting day of 1200Z April 27 (7:00 am CDT) to 1200Z April 28 (7:00 am CDT). 324 tornadic deaths were confirmed as a result of the outbreak, with as many as 238 in Alabama alone. The overall death toll also includes 32 deaths in Tennessee, 31 in Mississippi, 14 in Georgia, 5 in Arkansas, and 4 in Virginia, according to state officials. On April 27, President Barack Obama approved Governor Robert Bentley's request for emergency federal assistance including search and rescue support. On April 28, 2011, the National Weather Service sent out people to survey the damage; however, with the large number of tornadoes across Alabama, the reports were not finalized for months. By April 30, the death toll from the event (including death tolls from flooding and other severe weather) stood at more than 340 people across six states. On a lesser note, an F0 tornado (the Fujita scale was still used in Canada) downed trees and ripped siding off store buildings in Fergus, Ontario on April 27. May There were 370 tornadoes reported in the United States in May, of which 322 were confirmed. In addition to the events listed below, two other tornadoes, one in the Philippines and Taiwan, also touched down. The former of these resulted in significant damage and killed one person in Calumpit, Bulacan. =May 3 (New Zealand)= The Albany tornado caused significant damage to roofs of buildings in its path. On May 3, a line of showers and thunderstorms tracked into the Northland from the Tasman Sea, bringing unsettled weather to much of the region. The Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited (MetService) mentioned the possibility of strong thunderstorms being embedded within the line, producing small hail and gusty winds. Significant upward motion in the atmosphere developed in the region surrounding Auckland, prompting the MetService to issue a high-risk of thunderstorms in the area. With low-level wind shear and helicity, the possibility of tornadic activity was present. At 2:55 pm NZST, a hook echo was apparent on the weather radar, indicating strong rotation and a likely tornado. Several minutes later, around 3:00 pm NZST, a tornado struck the Auckland suburb of Albany. With winds estimated at , the tornado ranked as a high-end EF2 and caused considerable damage along a long track in the area. Several cars were tossed up to in the air by the storm and pieces of iron roofing were reportedly seen above the ground. A total of 50 homes sustained varying degrees of damage along the tornado's track. The most severe damage took place at a local shopping mall where large portions of the roof were torn off. One person was killed and at least 20 others were injured here. Damage estimates from the storm were places in the tens of millions. =May 9‚Äì10= This transmission tower near Wall, South Dakota was bent by an EF2 tornado On May 9, a strong upper-level ridge over the Mississippi River Valley produced a narrow axis of extreme instability from eastern Nebraska to central South Dakota. In light of this, the SPC issued a slight-risk of severe weather for much of South Dakota and Iowa as well as parts of Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska. Enhanced by a mid-level jet, wind shear in the region increased, providing a more favorable environment for strong thunderstorms. During the course of the day, two tornadoes, rated EF1 and EF2, touched down in South Dakota. The stronger of the two crumpled a transmission tower. Continuing into May 10, the system slowly moved eastward, shifting the center of severe activity in the Upper-Plains to Minnesota. Thunderstorms in the state mainly produced large hail, measured up to in diameter; however, one EF1 tornado touched down, causing significant damage to a garage. =May 11‚Äì13= On May 11, an upper-level low moved out of the Four Corners Region into the Central Plains, prompting a moderate-risk of severe weather from the SPC. The main threat from these storms was expected to be large hail, with a considerable region being given a 45 percent chance of hail. Later that day, the moderate- risk was discontinued and replaced by a large area under a slight-risk. According to the SPC, the issuance of a moderate risk was due to an \\"improper handling of ongoing storms.\\" Tornadic activity during the event was scattered and consisted of short-lived events. In all, at least nine tornadoes and a few gustnadoes touched down across four states, most of which were in Nebraska. In Iowa, twin tornadoes, rated EF0 and EF1, struck the city of Lenox, damaging several homes. Continuing eastward, the low became diffuse and produced scattered severe weather on May 12 and 13. ''' =May 21‚Äì26= On May 21, a small system of thunderstorms began to develop in Brown County, Kansas. At the same time, another system formed to the southeast of Emporia, Kansas. The Brown county system developed into a tornado over Shawnee County, Kansas and touched down over Topeka, Kansas for several seconds causing minor damage nearby. Meanwhile, the Emporia system continued to move to the northeast, where an EF3 tornado heavily damaged the town of Reading, Kansas. One person was killed there, several others were injured and at least 20 houses were destroyed. After hitting Topeka it hit several towns including Oskaloosa, Kansas, doing extensive damage to that community. Several other tornadoes touched down in the region that evening. St. John's Regional Medical Center after the May 22 Joplin tornado A debarked tree just north El Reno with various debris, including a car, piled at its base. Note the severe ground scouring in the foreground. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for much of the Midwest south to Oklahoma for May 22. The first tornadic supercell that day developed in the mid-afternoon hours over the western Twin Cities with a swath of damage, especially in and around Minneapolis, Minnesota. An intense tornado also tracked towards Harmony, Minnesota that afternoon and a tornado emergency was issued. Late that afternoon, at about 5:15 pm CDT (2215 UTC), a very large and intense multiple-vortex tornado resulted in catastrophic damage in Joplin, Missouri. Many houses and businesses were flattened and some even were blown away in Joplin, the main hospital was heavily damaged and many people were reported to have been trapped in destroyed houses. The Weather Channel video showed entire communities flattened. Early reports suggest there were at least 125 fatalities, but as of May 2012, the death toll was confirmed at exactly 158, and another 1,000+ injured. This tornado was given a rating of EF5. Late in the afternoon on May 24, supercells began forming over western Kansas and Oklahoma, as the National Weather Service predicted a dangerous tornado outbreak. As a line of powerful cells began to take shape, trained spotters reported large tornadoes near El Reno, Oklahoma and in rural Grady County, Oklahoma. One of these swept from Binger to Guthrie, destroying many homes and causing at least nine fatalities. This tornado was rated an EF5, the sixth of the year and second of the outbreak sequence. Three other EF4 tornadoes developed among the many other tornadoes that day. At around 10:00 pm EDT on May 25, an EF3 tornado hit the city of Bedford, Indiana. U.S. Route 50 was temporarily closed due to heavy debris. Also, a tornado had reportedly touched down in Keyser, WV and tracked as far as Berkeley Springs. On May 26, strong thunderstorms travelled through the Cumberland Valley in South Central Pennsylvania with reports of EF1 tornadoes near Carlisle, Mechanicsburg, and Hershey. Tornadoes also destroyed the setup for the Harrisburg ArtsFest scheduled to take place the following weekend. =May 25 (California)= Three tornadoes hit the Sacramento Valley of California, north of Sacramento. One tornado rated at EF1, struck east of Artois uprooting hundreds of almond trees, and causing damage to farm equipment and roofing materials. Another tornado rated at EF1, struck south of Durham, uprooting thousands of almond trees, destroying an out building, and damaging a barn. A tornado rated at EF2, struck northwest of Oroville, causing heavy damage to a ranch and a garage. June There were 177 tornadoes reported in the United States in June, of which 156 were confirmed. In addition to the events listed below, two tornadoes caused moderate damage in the city of New Plymouth in New Zealand. =June 1= The Springfield tornado. In the Northeast, several severe thunderstorms began developing along the tail end of a cold front during the late morning hours of June 1. By the early afternoon, a tornado watch was issued for parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. A rare tornado outbreak (for the region) began late that afternoon with several tornadoes confirmed in Maine and Massachusetts. That afternoon, an EF3 tornado occurred in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts and continued east for 39 miles devastating the towns of Westfield, Wilbraham, Monson, Brimfield, Sturbridge, Southbridge and Charlton. Major damage in the area was reported; there were some roof collapses in downtown businesses and damage to the brick structures. Numerous injuries were reported there. Significant damage was also reported in West Springfield, Monson and several other communities where houses were reported to have been destroyed or flattened. Three deaths have been directly attributed to the Springfield tornado, the first killer tornado in Massachusetts since 1995. =June 18‚Äì22= The Polk County tornado. On June 19, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of severe weather for the Central Plains. By the evening hours, several tornadoes had touched down over rural areas. 48 tornadoes have been reported to the Storm Prediction Center. During the afternoon of June 20, a PDS tornado watch was issued for much of central Nebraska and north-central Kansas due to the threat of significant tornadoes. Additionally, very large hail, at least in diameter, is expected within the watch area. Around 1:00 p.m. local time, storm chasers reported a large EF3 tornado on the ground north of Hill City, Kansas and again later that afternoon near Elm Creek, Nebraska. Numerous other tornadoes were reported across the region including near Ravenna and in York County, some reported to have been very large and intense, but mostly over open country. Tornado warnings are streaching from North Dakota to Kansas. Additionally, a major derecho event may develop farther south ‚Äì a PDS Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued for parts of Oklahoma and North Texas as well. On the 21st, tornado watches were issued for several areas, including central Minnesota and Wisconsin, southern Illinois and parts of Missouri, and lower Michigan. Tornadoes were reported in Anoka County, Minnesota, and Green Lake and Fond du Lac Counties in Wisconsin. Additionally, local law enforcement reported a tornado in Allegan County in Michigan, with photos taken also showing what looked like a tornado, but no damage was seen in the area, and the National Weather Service determined it to have been low hanging clouds. Meanwhile, a major derecho event impacted the Chicago Metropolitan Area. The worst damage was in Wheeling, Illinois. A series of tornadoes tracked across the Louisville, Kentucky area late on June 22. A total of five tornadoes were confirmed in the area, including two that were rated EF2. One of the tornadoes directly hit Churchill Downs severely damaging several buildings on the site. Other significant damage was reported in several industrial parks in the metropolitan area with buildings heavily damaged. Tornadoes were also confirmed in Mississippi, Tennessee, Michigan, and Indiana. July There were 92 tornadoes reported in the United States in July, of which 102 were confirmed. The higher final total is due to a large number of late reports. In Alberta, Canada, at least four tornadoes touched down on various days, causing relatively minor damage. 12 buildings over a one block area were affected. Some damaged roofs and flooded streets. =July 1= On July 1, an extreme straight-line wind and derecho event took place over South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. Winds as high as caused extensive damage, especially along the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin. In addition to the straight-line winds, seven tornadoes touched down, two of which were rated EF2. =July 11= A powerful derecho formed in Iowa and moved through Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio generating winds as high as in Vinton, Iowa. It also spawned a weak EF0 tornado that damaged crops in Moorland, Iowa. =July 16‚Äì17= Numerous tornadoes touched down over the northern Plains on both July 16 and 17 at the edge of a very hot, humid air mass. At least 16 tornadoes were reported, mostly in North Dakota. Most remained over open country but a few caused significant damage, including a house which was destroyed from a strong EF3 tornado in LaMoure County. August There were 52 tornadoes reported in the United States in August, of which 59 were confirmed. The higher final total is due to late reports. =August 1 (Russia)= On August 1, an F2 tornado struck the city of Blagoveshchensk, Russia.

He was a Roman Catholic and could generally rely on the support of the Catholic hierarchy, although his support for the Ecclesiastical Titles Act offended some of his co- religionists.Fitzgerald p.137 His appointment to the Bench was well-deserved on merit, but is said to have been partly the result of the Government's policy of increasing the number of Catholic judges. The appointment of such a noted Chancery lawyer to a common law court caused some surprise, but in time he came to be recognised as one of the few lawyers who had successfully made the transition from one system of law to another.Fitzgerald p.137  Family  He married Sarah Isabella l'Estrange, daughter of Major Francis l'Estrange.

The house, grounds and a number of exhibits are open to the public. History Designed by local architects William and James Owen, Scolton Manor was built in 1840 and occupied from 1842 by the Higgon family. The house replaced a former building owned by the same family which had burned down in the mid-eighteenth century. Prominent amongst Pembrokeshire society, three Higgon family members held the position of High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, including the last resident, Lt Col John Henry Victor Higgon (1902-1987). It is a country house built in a neo-classical style, with unpainted stucco, with a slated, hipped roofs and flat overhanging eaves. Taken over by Pembrokeshire County Council, the grounds have become a country park and the house has been restored. Both are open to the public. Scolton Manor is home to Pembrokeshire's County Museum Service.

Development Developed in parallel with the I.A.R. 15, the model '16' featured for the first time an all-metal airframe structure, covered with duralumin sheets, plywood and fabric. It resembled the I.A.R. 14 more closely than the I.A.R. 15, being inferior to the latter. The fuselage outlines followed the '14's, as did the wings, although their area was increased to 20.30 m2. The tail section, as usual, was redesigned, the rear part this time becoming rounded. The two-strut undercarriage of the I.A.R. 14 was retained as well, and the tailskid appeared again. A new British radial engine, the Bristol Mercury IV S2, of maximum 560 h.p. (418 kW) output at 4,500 m, was experimented with. The powerplant was covered with a narrow Townend ring and individual exhaust pipes were fitted to each of the nine cylinders. The typical feature of this model was a large propeller cone fitted to a Bristol- made two-blade wooden airscrew. Due to the larger wings and all-metal fuselage structure the empty weight increased to 1,430 kg, giving a relatively high, 70.14 kg/m2 wing load, that increased further during flight, taking also into consideration that the all-up weight was 1,650 kg. The usual armament, comprising two 7.7 mm Vickers machine guns, featured on all early I.A.R. fighters, was employed, this time placed in the wings and firing outside the propeller arc. The British engine offered an impressive maximum speed of 342 km/h at 5,000 m that could be reached in 6 ¬Ω minutes, while the ceiling was established at 10,000 m. Operational history The I.A.R. 16, first flown in 1934, remained in prototype stage. Its only significant achievement was the improvement of Romania's national altitude record. Piloted by Locotenent aviator Papana, on 16 July 1935, the I.A.R. 16, featuring an enclosed cockpit, took off from Pipera airfield at 17.48 p.m. 47 minutes later it established a new altitude of 11,631 m (at that time, the world altitude record was held by the Italian Cdr. R. Donati, who reached 14,433 m on 11 April 1934, while flying a Caproni 161), beating the previous 10,518 m set up by the late Romeo Popescu. The prototype was still seen in 1935-1936 at various air shows, where Alex. Papana performed high-level aerobatics to the delight of the spectators.

The setting for the fair is a village called Morelandshire, sometime between 1533 and 1536.  History  The fair was founded in 1994, and held for three seasons at the Butler County Fairgrounds, while the organizers searched for a suitable property. The present site, an abandoned farm which had subsequently been strip mined and landscaped, was selected for its ideal location and setting, and first hosted the fair in the summer of 1997. In 2006 the fair was canceled due to lack of financing. However, a year later, the fair was purchased by Rocky Mountain Festivals and was reopened under the direction of the company's CEO. With the 2020 season cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 27th was deferred to 2021.

Watson was the eldest son of Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham and his wife Catherine Sondes, daughter of George Sondes, 1st Earl of Feversham. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford on 1 June 1703, aged 16 and travelled abroad to Germany in 1707. Watson arrived back from Germany in 1708, in time to be elected as a Whig Member of Parliament for Canterbury at the 1708 British general election. He proposed a motion on 25 January 1709 for an address to the Queen that she should consider remarrying. He also supported the naturalization of the Palatines. He was appointed to a committee to draft a bill to limit the time allowed for public mourning, since this was felt to be having an adverse effect on Canterbury's silk trade. He also voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell and possibly in consequence he lost his seat at the 1710 British general election. He was returned unopposed as MP for New Romney at a by-election on 20 April 1713. Following his father's elevation as Earl of Rockingham in 1714, he was styled Viscount Sondes. In 1718, he went over to the Opposition and in 1719 he was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales. Watson died in 1722, predeceasing his father by 2 years. He married Catherine Tufton, eldest daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet in 1709, and had three sons and a daughter: * Lewis Watson, 2nd Earl of Rockingham, no issue * Thomas Watson, 3rd Earl of Rockingham, no issue * Edward Watson, no issue * Katherine Watson, married Edward Southwell and had issue. In 1729 his widow and her four sisters became co-heiresses to the Barony of Clifford. The abeyance was terminated in 1734 for the third sister Margaret, wife of Lord Lovel, but following her death without surviving issue in 1775 the barony was restored in favour of Viscount Sondes' grandson Edward Southwell, 20th Baron Clifford.

Developed from 1790, by the late 1930s it had become the largest steel mill in Europe. Nationalized after World War II, as the steel industry changed to bulk handling, iron and steel making was ceased in the 1970s, as the site was redeveloped as a specialised tinplate works. Closed by Corus in 2002, the site is being redeveloped in a joint-partnership between Blaenau Gwent Council and the Welsh Government. Development By the mid to late 1700s, the steep-sided wooded valley of the Ebbw Fawr river was called home by a population of around 120, who worked the valley as farmers. But the valley was about to transformed by the Industrial Revolution, by the building of what became Europe's largest steel mill. In 1789, Walter Watkins was the owner of a forge in Glangrwney, near Crickhowell, which lacked an adequate supply of pig iron from the Clydach Ironworks. In agreement with two business partners, his son-in-law Charles Cracroft and iron master Jeremiah Homfray of the Penydarren Ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil, Watkins leased land at Pen y Cae farm in the parish of Aberystruth from John Miles. Situated on the northern tip of the South Wales coalfield and located next to the River Ebbw, they had easy access to the basic iron making materials: coal and iron ore obtained by 'patch' working and local drifts and levels, plus water and power from the river. Limestone was to be transported by mule train from Llanelly Quarries, about four miles away. The partnership erected a single blast furnace and casting shop against the hillside, which created a weekly output of 25 tons of pig iron per week. Called \\"Pen y cae\\" after the farming hamlet by the locals, the partners adopted the river's name to form the Ebbw Vale Furnace Company Ltd (EVC), hence naming both the works and the developing township. In 1793 Homfray bought out his partners with help from the Bristol-based Quaker family the Harfords, who in 1796 bought out Homfray himself to take complete ownership. Early 19th century The plant was developed as a specialist forge, and needing additional supplies of iron the company, now owned by the Hardfords family trust, bought and integrated the Sirhowy Ironworks and colliery. The company then built four new cupola furnaces, and added steam engine power. This allowed the company to produce the world's first rolled-steel rail tracks in 1857, later followed by the pioneering Liverpool & Manchester and the Stockton & Darlington Railway. =Transport= A mobile phone mast sits atop the trackbed of the former Rassa Railroad, extended to enable limestone to be moved from Cwar y Hendre to the iron and steel works at Ebbw Vale. Timber sleepers and some of the original stone sleepers can still be seen today along this bridleway The new railway line contracts required additional integration across the production facilities. In 1794 the company built a tunnel for the new Rassa Railroad, a tramway built to connect the Sirhowy Ironworks to the Beaufort Ironworks at Ebbw Vale, and connected them both to several limestone quarries at Trevil. By this time both the company and the Tredegar Iron Company had need to transport raw materials to and products from various iron works in the upper Ebbw Valley, to Newport Docks. Developments included: *Rassa Railroad: Sirhowy Ironworks to the Beaufort Ironworks, Ebbw Vale, and connected them both to several limestone quarries at Trevil. *Llanhiledd Tramroad: from Crumlin (low level) north to Ebbw Vale. *Sirhowy Tramroad: Newport to Crumlin (low level). By 1805, a stretch of tramline had been laid to transport coal and iron ore to Newport Docks, laid jointly by Tredegar Iron Company and the Monmouthshire Canal Company. Pulled by teams of horses, in 1829 Chief Engineer Thomas Ellis was authorised to purchase a steam locomotive from the Stephenson Company. Built at Tredegar Works, it made its maiden trip on 17 December 1829. On grouping in 1923, all of these railway lines became part of the Great Western Railway's Ebbw Vale Line, now operated as a passenger-only service by Transport for Wales. =New owners, expansion= After some commercial failures in the United States, in 1844 the Hardford's family trust sold the works to partners Abraham Darby, Henry Dickenson, Joseph Robinson and J Tothill of Coalbrookdale, with partner Thomas Brown designated managing director. This change started a period of expansion via acquisition, including: *Three blast furnaces of the Victoria Ironworks from Lord Llanover, originally built for the Monmouthshire Iron & Coal Company *Abersychan Ironworks, consisting of six blast furnaces *Production facilities in Pontypool consisting of four furnaces, a forge, tinplate works and coal collieries *Iron ore fields in the Brendon Hills, Somerset, Bilbao, Spain and the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire In 1850, the company's chemist George Parry achieved a great economy in blast furnace practice, the first to adopt the cup and cone successfully on blast furnaces. He then conducted experiments in converting iron into steel, but the company was eventually forced to adopt the patented process of Henry Bessemer. By 1863, the company was producing 100,000 tons of rail and merchant bars per annum, from 19 blast furnaces, 192 puddling furnaces, and 99 heating furnaces located at: Ebbw Vale; Sirhowy; Victoria; Abersychan; Pontypool; Abercarn. It also had six wharfs at Newport Docks, the hematite mine in the Forest of Dean, and spathic iron ore mines in the Brendon Hills and Spain. Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company In June 1868, Darby converted the partnership into a limited company, the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company (EVSICC),\\"Money-Market and City Intelligence\\", The Times, 27 June 1868 headquartered in Manchester. The capital injection allowed investment in the most powerful blowing engine in the world to serve four of the Ebbw Vale furnaces, new rolling mills and a Bessemer converter shop which produced the first steel ingots, including high carbon spiegel-eisen (mirror iron). =1930s redevelopment= By 1929, a lack of investment had led to a lack of new orders. The oncoming economic depression lead to a shut-down of the works and resultant huge redundancies, with minimal maintenance applied to the residual infrastructure. The result was that by 1934, unemployment in Ebbw Vale stood at 54% out of a population of 31,000. In 1935, the UK Government forced the shareholders of EVSICC to sell the site to tin plate manufacturer Richard Beaumont Thomas. He choose to import the UK's first continuous hot rolling mill from the United States, and totally redevelop a modern steelworks site around this technology. Due to the quality of steel produced by the mill, Thomas effectively started the redevelopment of the entire UK steel industry, with the mill producing hot rolled coils instead of bars, billets and plates. Two and a half years later, production at the site restarted. This drew former steelworkers back to the valley, and by 1948 the plant was producing 600,000 tons of rolled steel annually, the biggest steel plant in Europe. The resultant lack of manpower also drew in migrant workers from all over devastated post-war Europe and the British Empire. =World War II= Most occupations inside the steel works were considered reserved trades, and so were able to opt out of the compulsory call-up for World War II military service. However, a number of men did decide to enlist, which resulted in some trades being worked throughout the war by women for the first time. The plant drew specific attention from German Luftwaffe bombers on more than one occasion, however the deep valley proved difficult to bomb and the plant survived. Richard Thomas & Baldwins Ebbw Vale steelworks in 1969, by this time under the control of British Steel Corporation In 1948 in post-war Britain, two of the country's largest steel companies: Richard Thomas, which had plants in Ebbw Vale, Gloucester and the Forest of Dean; and Baldwins, with plants in Stourport and South Wales; agreed to a merger. The new company, Richard Thomas and Baldwins was resultantly the UK's largest steel maker by volume. In 1948 RTB introduced the first continuous tinning line at its Ebbw Vale tinplate works. In 1951 RTB was nationalised and placed under the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. Under Conservative rule in 1953 it passed to the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency in readiness for privatisation. However, its size - it was the UK's largest steel company - inhibited its sale. It was still in public ownership when the industry was re-nationalised under British Steel Corporation in 1967. British Steel 10 May 1989, and a British Railways Class 37 diesel locomotive hauls a train of rolled steel coils up the Ebbw Valley towards the tinplate works, passing the recently closed Marine Colliery in Cwm, Blaenau Gwent. Marine was a former EVSICC colliery, and this picture epitomises the integrated nature of coal and iron ore with steel making Nationalised as part of British Steel from 1967, it became part of the South Wales group alongside Llanwern and Port Talbot Steelworks. By this time 14,500 people were employed in the works in and around Ebbw Vale. The original choice for the site was due to it co-location with both iron ore and coal. However, by the 1970s the industry had changed to one of sheer volume, with supplies drawn from vast mines and pits. If plants were remote from these, then they had to have access to bulk material handling transport facilities, such as deep water ports. Ebbw Vale was neither located near such vast pits, or bulk shipping facilities. Resultantly, when British Steel announced its 10-year integrated production plan for South Wales, it came as no real surprise that it proposed the cessation of iron and steel making operations at the Ebbw Vale works, with the proposal to redeveloped the site as a specialist tinplate manufacturer. The closure of the coke ovens in March 1972 allowed work to commence on removing the 19th century \\"drill ground\\" tip, which contained 500,000 tons of waste material. Once the waste removal was complete, British Steel showed plans for the redevelopment of Ebbw Vale. The former waste site was back-filled, and allowed the cold rolling mill to be extended. This was now able to supply sufficient capacity of rolled steel to a new tinplate complex, the development of which started in 1974 with the commissioning of a newly built hydrochloric acid pickle line. With staff redeployed to the developing tin plate plant, on 17 July 1975 both the converter shop and all remaining blast furnaces closed, having produced 16,916,523 tons of iron. The continuous hot strip mill rolled its last hot rolled coil on 29 September 1977, having rolled 23million tons of steel since first being commissioned in 1937. Having slabbed 24 million tons of steel, the final cast was made in the open hearth department in May 1978. Again, demolition and clearance of these plants allowed the start of construction of phase2 of the tinplate works. This included new constructions of: an effluent plant; single stack annealing line; two electrolytic tinning lines (ETL); a cleaning line; and a Hallden Shears plant. Having cost ¬£57 million, the plant was officially opened in June 1978 by Derek Hornby, the President of the Food Manufacturing Federation. It was envisaged in the original plan that phase3 would then be constructed to double production yet again, but it was never authorised for planning by the government. =Ebbw Vale Garden Festival= The 1992 National Garden Festival, the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival It took until 1981 before demolition and clearance of the former iron and steel plants was completed, which also moved inwards the residual tinplate works southern boundary. It was on this part of the site that Blaenau Gwent Borough Council approved a bid for the 1992 National Garden Festival, awarded to the council and site in November 1988. It was billed as Garden Festival Wales , attracting over 2 million visitors to South Wales. https://www.blaenau-gwent.gov.uk/en/visitors/parks- countryside/festival-park/ Closure On 6 October 1999, a merger was announced between the Koninklijke Hoogovens steel company of the Netherlands, and British Steel plc to form new company Corus. Although investment had continued at the Ebbw Vale site over the past two decades, No.2 ETL had been shut down in 1995, and rather than be redeveloped as planned had become a source of spares for the No.1 ETL. Steel production capacity was in excess of the required market in Europe, hence the need for the merger, which would result in the closure of capacity across the newly integrated company. With much tinplate consumption moving to the newly expanding Asian market, it came as little surprise when on 1 February 2001 that Corus announced the complete closure of the Ebbw Vale site, and the resultant loss of 780 jobs. The plant began a shut-down procedure, with many of the lines within the plant packaged up and transported to other sites in the Corus company (Trostre near Llanelli, and IJmuiden in the Netherlands), while other plants were sold as a package to an Indian-based company. In July 2002, the Ebbw Vale steel works site closed; a skeleton staff deconstructed the remaining sold plants and handled shipping of residual finished product until December 2002. Redevelopment Grade II listed former Steelworks General Offices, April 2008 From mid-2002, Scottish site clearance and demolition contractors Morton were on site, to assess the land needs to leave the site fit and ready for future development. Demolition commenced in August 2002, and the land was remediated over a period of approximately five years. After Corus sold the site in 2005 to Blaenau Gwent Council, in 2007 a ¬£350 million regeneration project was jointly announced by the council and the Welsh Government. Outline planning permission was granted for a mixed use redevelopment, including: housing; retail & office; wetlands; and a learning campus. The council itself proposed the development of a ¬£15 million urban village scheme close to the town, which would house a new railway station and elevated access to/from the main town. The first part of the scheme, the 2010 opened Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan, provided Wales' first all- individual-bed hospital, named after National Health Service founder Aneurin Bevan. =Steelworks General Offices= In October 2011, the 1915-16 constructed Grade II listed former Steelworks General Offices were reopened after a ¬£12 million refit. Redeveloped as a visitor centre and archive, the original building houses the Ebbw Vale Steelworks Archive Trust, a voluntary organisation which holds an historical record of steel making in Ebbw Vale, and a \\"4D\\" immersive cinema. A newly built wing houses the Gwent Archives, which were moved from Cwmbran, providing of shelving to house thousands of documents which date back to the 12th century. HM Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the General Offices as part of her Diamond Jubilee Tour on 3 May 2012, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh.

Abal, who previously served as Foreign Minister from August 2007 to December 2010, became the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in a cabinet reshuffle by Michael Somare on 7 December 2010. He further became acting Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea on 13 December 2010, when Prime Minister Somare stepped down from office to face a tribunal regarding allegations of financial mismanagement. His tenure as acting Prime Minister ended on 2 August 2011, when Peter O'Neill won a parliamentary vote to be appointed as Prime Minister. Biography =Personal life= Abal is the son of Sir Tei Abal, who is considered one of the founding fathers of Papua New Guinea. =Political career= Abal was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea representing the Wabag Electorate in Enga Province. Prime Minister Michael Somare appointed Abal, his then Foreign Minister, as his new Deputy Prime Minister in a cabinet reshuffle on 7 December 2010. Abal was informed of the impending reshuffle prior to the appointment while attending a mining conference in Sydney, Australia, with Prime Minister Somare. Somare removed his previous Deputy Prime Minister, Don Polye of Kandep, from the post in favour of Sam Abal, a close political ally of Somare. A rift had formed between Somare and Polye stemming from an unsuccessful motion of no confidence against Somare in mid-2010, which was believed to be partially spearheaded by Polye. Somare initiated the reshuffle in preparation for stepping down to face a leadership tribunal. It is alleged that Somare failed to submit financial statements between 1994 and 1997 and filed late statements between 1998 and 2004. Under Papua New Guinean law, the prime minister must leave office during the tribunal. The appointment of Abal guaranteed Somare a close ally as acting Prime Minister. =Acting Prime Minister= Somare stepped down as Prime Minister on 13 December 2010. In a prepared statement, Somare stated that \\"he will now voluntarily step aside and allow the deputy prime minister, Sam Abal, to assume (the) full function and responsibility of the office of prime minister while he attends to clearing his name.\\" Abal was sworn into office the same day and served as the acting Prime Minister during Somare's tribunal and short suspension. Abal once again became acting Prime Minister in April 2011 when Prime Minister Somare flew to Singapore for heart surgery. Somare remained in hospital in Singapore in intensive care until his retirement from office in late June 2011. In June 2011, the body of a woman was found in the garden of his home in Port Moresby. His son Teo, \\"allegedly the last person to be seen with the woman\\", went missing at that time, and was found and arrested two days later by the police, as the prime suspect. Sam Abal \\"moved into a local hotel\\" as his home had become a crime scene.\\"Woman's body found in Papua New Guinea leader's home\\", BBC, 15 June 2011\\"Police after Abal‚Äôs son\\", Post Courier, 15 June 2011 \\"Abal‚Äôs relative a prime suspect\\", The National, 15 June 2011 As of 28 June 2011, it was unclear whether Abal would become the full- time Prime Minister following Somare's retirement from politics for health reasons. A spokesman for Michael Somare's son, Arthur Somare, said that \\"the political process will take its course\\" and decide Abal's political future. Abal had been Somare's deputy before serving as acting Prime Minister. =2012 election= In 2012, Abal became the deputy Opposition Leader upon the retirement of opposition leader, Dame Carol Kidu. In June 2012, the Papua New Guinea Post-Courier reported that Abal would run for re-election in the 2012 general election as a political independent. Abal stated he had lost faith in country's political party system, which had led to chaos and gridlock in the government. However, he lost his seat to People's Party candidate Robert Ganim.

He served as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1856 to 1858. He was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) from 1858 to 1867 when he was appointed Lord Justice of Appeal in Chancery. On the creation of the new Irish Court of Appeal in 1878 he served briefly on the Court but retired after a few months.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p.360 Christian was considered one of the best Irish lawyers of his time, but as a judge he regularly courted controversy. His bitter and sarcastic temper and open contempt for most of his colleagues led to frequent clashes both in Court and in the Press. Though he was rebuked for misconduct several times by the House of Commons, no serious thought seems to have been given to removing him from office.  Family  He was born in Carrick-on-Suir, third son of George Christian, a solicitor, and his wife Margaret Cormack. He was educated at the University of Dublin, entered Gray's Inn in 1831 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1834.Ball, p.360 He married Mary Thomas in 1859 and had four sons and four daughters. He lived at Ravenswell, Bray, County Wicklow.  Early career  His early years at the Bar were not successful, and he admitted to being near to despair at times about his prospects. His practice lay in the Court of Chancery (Ireland) : Chancery procedures then were extremely complex and he found them at first almost unintelligible. Gradually he mastered the intricacies of Chancery practice, became a leader of the Bar, and took silk in 1841. It was said that his expertise left the Lord Chancellor quite unable to argue with him.Hogan, Daire \\"Arrows Too Sharply Pointed-the relations of Lord Justice Christian and Lord O'Hagan\\" published in The Common Law Tradition Irish Academic Press Dublin 1990 He was appointed Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an influential post which involved assisting the Attorney General and Solicitor General in advising the Crown, but resigned in 1841, on the ground that it interfered with his private practice. He was appointed Third Sergeant in 1851 but resigned in 1855, allegedly because he was disappointed at not receiving further promotion. Promotion did in time come his way: he was appointed Solicitor General the following year and a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1858. He was unusual in having no strong political views: it was said that his political allegiance was known only to himself.Delaney V.T.H \\" Christopher Palles \\" Allen Figgis and Co. 1960  Controversy  As a judge of the Common Pleas Christian got on well with his colleagues, and any dissenting judgements he wrote were short and courteous. It was after his appointment as Lord Justice of Appeal in 1867 that his behaviour began to attract unfavourable comment, as he went out of his way to court controversy on a wide variety of topics. =Law Reports = Christian developed a deep contempt to for the Irish Reports, castigating them in open Court as \\"nonsense\\",\\"worthless rubbish\\" and \\"disjointed twaddle\\".Delaney, pp.91‚Äì2 Attempts by colleagues to get him to moderate his language failed. Christian threatened to refuse to let his judgements be reported, and in his last years relations with the law reporters were so bad that they simply published their uncorrected notes of his decisions rather than sending them to the judge for revision. = Vice-Chancellor = In 1867 a new office of Vice- Chancellor for Ireland was created; it was filled throughout its existence by one man, Hedges Eyre Chatterton, who retired in 1904. Despite his length of service, he was not considered a judge of the first rank, and Christian evidently combined feelings of professional contempt and personal dislike for him. He usually voted on appeal to overturn his judgments, and frequently added personal attacks on Chatterton, despite protests from his colleagues. The feud between the two judges reached the Press in 1870 when the Irish Times, without naming them, quoted one judge's opinion that another was \\"lazy, stupid, conceited and dogmatic\\".Hogan, p.70 Although Christian denied it, it was universally believed that he was the author of the remarks, which were aimed at Chatterton. Chatterton was fortunate in enjoying the support of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Thomas O'Hagan, 1st Baron O'Hagan, who was also on bad terms with Christian. = Lord O'Hagan = Christian had worked well with Abraham Brewster, O'Hagan's predecessor, whom he respected. For O'Hagan he felt the same dislike and contempt which he felt for Chatterton. Although they had served together in the Court of Common Pleas without any obvious ill-will, Christian considered O'Hagan's appointment as Lord Chancellor to be a purely political act, and that he was unfit to be either head of the judiciary or an appeal judge in Chancery; he also complained of what he saw as O'Hagan's laziness, which put an extra burden on him.Hogan, p.80 During O'Hagan's first term as Chancellor Christian subjected him to constant criticism; unwisely he did not confine these attacks to the Courtroom but published numerous pamphlets, and which was widely seen as improper. When O'Hagan became Chancellor for the second time, a friend congratulated him on escaping from \\"the misnamed Christian \\" who had retired two years earlier. It was probably his feud with O'Hagan which led to his extraordinary decision to publicly attack the House of Lords for reversing, by a majority including O'Hagan, his judgment in O'Rorke v Bolingbroke.(1877) 2 App Cas 814 In a letter to The Times in 1877, whose content has been described as \\"astounding\\", Christian questioned the Law Lords knowledge of equity: while he singled out Lord Blackburn for criticism, it is likely that he also intended to harm O'Hagan's reputation.Gullifer, Louise and Vogenauer, Stefan \\"English and European Perspectives on Contract and Commercial Law- essays in honour of Hugh Beale\\" Hart Publishing Oxford 2014 p.26 = Irish Land Acts = A major source of contention between Christian and O'Hagan was the First Irish Land Act 1870, which O'Hagan steered through Parliament. The Act provided for compensation for tenants in the event of eviction. Christian, though he was not a landowner and was not as a rule much interested in politics, objected strongly to the policy of the Act, which he believed to be most unjust to landlords. His attacks from the Bench on the Act led to serious rebukes both from the House of Commons and from the Press, which commented on the impropriety of a judge attacking an Act of Parliament, which it was his duty to enforce.Hogan, p.79  Later years  O'Hagan's retirement did nothing to lessen Christian's ill- temper; other judges came in for attack, including Chief Justice James Whiteside, whom he accused of speaking constantly on matters of which he was ignorant. In his later years he seems to have been a lonely and isolated figure: his vigorous opposition to the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act 1877 was entirely unsuccessful.Delaney p.92 A feeling of isolation may partly explain his decision to retire, though certainly his increasing deafness also played a part.  Assessment  Delaney praises Christian as a great master of equity, a man of great learning and a judge with a great desire to see justice done,Delaney p.92 but he does not deny that Christian loved controversy. Even his supporters spoke of \\"arrows too sharply pointed \\"; critics spoke of his \\"spirit of personal sarcasm, cold, keen and cynical\\". No doubt Christian was genuinely concerned to uphold high standards of judicial conduct, but as Hogan points out, his own conduct struck most observers as far more improper than anything he complained of in others.Hogan, p.62 References 1808 births 1887 deaths Solicitors- General for Ireland Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Lords Justice of Appeal for Ireland Serjeants-at-law (Ireland) 19th-century Irish judges ","title":"Jonathan Christian"},{"id":"30254488","title":"Mohokare Local Municipality"},{"id":"30254495","text":"Jacob Blomqvist (born November 8, 1986) is a Swedish professional ice hockey centre who is currently an unrestricted free agent.

It was one of the world's most profitable prior to bankruptcy and generated over $5 billion a year profits.Calls for casino on Christmas Island History The casino/resort was conceived in the early 1980s by Perth property developer Frank Woodmore as a business opportunity following the closure in 1981, for political reasons, of Indonesia's three licensed casinos, all of which were in Jakarta. With Jakarta less than an hour's flight from Christmas Island, the casino was intended to attract high rollers from Indonesia and other Asian countries.Report to the Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. In 1985 a company, Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (CIR) was incorporated, with Woodmore, through Mercator Property Consultants Pty Ltd, initially holding 10% of the share capital, with other interests, principally controlled by Indonesian businessman Robby Sumampow, acquiring the remainder. Construction of the resort began late in the 1980s. On 5 November 1993 CIR was granted an Australian casino licence, with the building complex formally opened as the Christmas Island Casino and Resort on 18 December 1993. As envisaged, the casino catered mainly to a wealthy Asian clientele, with most of its patrons flying in from Jakarta, often by private jet. Business was facilitated by the Australian government, which issued special short-term visas for Christmas Island. Initially the resort operated profitably, with most revenue coming from the casino. However, after 1994, CIR made losses. The resort was badly affected by the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, and it suspended operations on 23 April 1998. On 28 July 1998 the Australian Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government cancelled CIR's casino licence and, the following day, the company went into receivership. In 2000 the resort was purchased from the liquidators by David Kwon, a Sydney-based businessman. In July 2004 a proposal by KFL Star Resort, a consortium of South Korean investors registered in Perth, to reopen the casinoOld casino plan to ease Christmas Island crush was rejected by the Australian Government, with the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads Senator Ian Campbell quoted as saying that in the \\"interests of the Christmas Island community,Give casino to community, says island chief the Australian Government has decided to make legislative changes to prohibit casino operations\\".Murdoch (2004). In July 2009 it was reported that the Australian Federal Government was negotiating with Kwon about using the resort facilities to relieve overcrowding at the island's Immigration Detention Centre because of increases in boatloads of asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia.Wright & Narushima (2009). In response, the island's Shire President, Gordon Thomson, said that the Australian government should take control of the then mothballed resort and hand it over to the Christmas Island community to operateCasino for asylum housing as a tourist resort.Wright (2009). In 2013, Kwon started negotiations with the Australian government for the possibility to lease the resort as a viable solution to the island's growing economic needs.A Remote Island Seeks A Boom Without a Bust Description The resort lies on a 47 ha block of land, a 99-year crown lease issued in 1989, at Waterfall Bay on the north-eastern coastal terraces of the island, not far from the airport. It contains 156 guest rooms and suites as well as other resort facilities such as restaurants, nightclubs and a swimming pool. When it operated as a casino the facilities included 43 slot machines and 23 gambling tables. CIR also owned the Christmas Island Lodge, containing 80 motel-style rooms, in Poon Saan as well as 144 apartments for staff accommodation. It has 156 fully furnished hotel rooms of which 52 of them are two-story suites with ocean views.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History Calvary Baptist Church was organized 1878 to serve the growing African-American population of the city. By the 1880s, there were two-dozen black families on Main Street in the shadow of the Sedgwick County Courthouse. Most had moved to Wichita from southern states after the Civil War. The city continued to attract black residents and by the 1920 census, the black population of Wichita was 3,545 with a total population of 72,200. Membership at Calvary Baptist Church stood at 500 and 15 other congregations thrived in the city. The historic black community grew to encompass a 15-block area by the 1950s when urban renewal attempts displaced many of the area's residents. The congregation relocated to a new structure approximately north in 1972 and Sedgwick County acquired the historic structure in 1975. The building currently houses The Kansas African American Museum. Architecture The structure was built between c.1917 and 1920 and replaced an earlier church on the site constructed in 1911 and soon deemed unsafe by the state fire marshall. It is designed in the classical revival style and constructed of red brick with limestone accents. The church building is located on the west side of Water Street, north of Elm Street. The Sedgwick County Jail, constructed between 1990 and 2001 wraps around three sides of the church. The structure measures with a one-story addition at the rear. The two main floors sit on a raised basement. The east fa√ßade is dominated by the entrance which consists of a triangular pediment resting on four two-story limestone columns. A flight of stairs leads from the street level to a small portico containing entrance doors. A Dentiled cornice extends from the pediment around the building just above the second floor. The interior is dominated by the Akron-plan worship space which occupies the center of the building. The main sanctuary is on the main level with a three- level balcony that wraps three sides and allows for increased capacity. The chancel occupies one corner of the space with the organ pipes in the wall above. Portions of the main floor can be closed to accommodate Sunday school classes or other activities. The sanctuary contains several stained glass windows and an octagonal stained glass skylight. Many of the windows were donated by members of the congregation and contain dedications. The congregation purchased the organ from the M. P. Moller Company for $3,900. It contains 21 stops with three manuals. The lower level contains additional meeting space, offices and restrooms. The Negro Star reported in its September 24, 1920 edition that the total construction cost for the facility was $60,000.

Part of this tour was captured on film and included in footage of the documentary video Propstar. In July 2003 he became a member of Hirax. The band played two shows in Bang Your Head Festival in Germany, amongst other bands like Dio, Twisted Sister, Overkill, Dokken and others. In September, he traveled back home to Argentina and did a drum clinic for the Drummers Club (Club de Bateristas de Argentina). In 2004 after the release of The New Age of Terror the band tour Europe and played in Sweden Rock Festival, Headbangers Open Air Festival and Metal Bash Open Air Festival. Hirax released the DVD Thrash 'Til Death that includes the latest concerts with Jorge in Germany, Sweden and USA from The New Age of Terror tour. The re-release of the album includes bonus DVD footage of Jorge's performance. In April 2004, Jorge recorded for Silversteel. In May 2008, Hirax singer Katon W. De Pena invited him to return to the band and tour France. Upon their return from France, Jorge was officially recruited to the band and they toured the US. They played in The Tidal Metal Fest 13 together with Exodus. They also toured Norway, Japan and South America. In 2010 Hirax released a new album, El Rostro de la Muerte.

TGM5 encodes one member of the multigene transglutaminase family. Transglutaminases (TGs) are involved in protein cross-linking by catalyzing the formation of gamma-glutamyl-lysine isodipeptide bonds between adjacent polypeptides (Candi et al. 2005; Eckert et al. 2005). This process is particularly important in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis, where TGs heavily cross-link keratins and a range of differentiation-specific structural proteins, such as involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, and small proline-rich proteins, in the formation of the cornified cell envelope in the biogenesis of the stratum corneum, the outermost, ‚Äúdead‚Äù layer of the epidermis (Kalinin et al. 2002). This continuously shed outer layer of the epidermis performs the main barrier function of the skin. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in TGM1 have been shown to cause lamellar ichthyosis, a disease characterized by excessive scaling and shedding of the outer epidermis (Huber et al. 1995; Parmentier et al. 1995; Russell et al. 1995).  Clinical significance  TGM5 mutations can cause acral peeling skin syndrome, an autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by the shedding of the outer epidermis. In the acral form, the dorsa of the hands and feet are predominantly affected. Ultrastructural analysis has revealed tissue separation at the junction between the granular cells and the stratum corneum in the outer epidermis. Genomewide linkage analysis in a consanguineous Dutch kindred mapped the gene to 15q15.2 in the interval between markers D15S1040 and D15S1016. Two homozygous missense mutations, T109M and G113C, were found in TGM5, which encodes transglutaminase 5 (TG5), in all affected persons in two unrelated families. The mutation was present on the same haplotype in both kindreds, indicating a probable ancestral mutation. TG5 is strongly expressed in the epidermal granular cells, where it cross-links a variety of structural proteins in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis to form the cornified cell envelope. An established, in vitro, biochemical cross-linking assay revealed that, although T109M is not pathogenic, G113C completely abolishes TG5 activity. Three- dimensional modeling of TG5 showed that G113C lies close to the catalytic domain, and, furthermore, that this glycine residue is conserved in all known transglutaminases, which is consistent with pathogenicity. Other families with more-widespread peeling skin phenotypes lacked TGM5 mutations. This study identifies the first causative gene in this heterogeneous group of skin disorders and demonstrates that the protein cross-linking function performed by TG5 is vital for maintaining cell-cell adhesion between the outermost layers of the epidermis.

Opened in 1866, it forms part of the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway, which also links Florence with Rome. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Regional train services calling at the station are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. Location Perugia railway station is situated at Piazza Vittorio Veneto, in the heavily populated district of Fontivegge, about southwest of the city centre. History The station was opened on 12 December 1866, upon the inauguration of the Ellera Corciano‚ÄìPonte San Giovanni section of the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway. Features =Buildings= The passenger building is a large structure built on three levels. Only the ground floor is accessible to travellers, through a main entrance below three large arches. Adjacent to the main building are two other buildings arranged symmetrically on a single plane. The Piazza and passenger building. Inside the entrance to the passenger building is a ticket office. This room is very large. In its middle are four substantial columns, supporting a high ceiling. Dividing the ticket hall from the station yard are three blue and green glass doors. The waiting room is also very large. It has beautiful wooden benches, which, although antique, are still in very good condition. Passengers inside the building can also admire a sculpture from Roman times in honor of the sacrifice of Perugia in the war against Hannibal. Above the sculpture are modern style mosaic pictorial maps of Umbria and Perugia. Extending from the passenger building are several small buildings, including a modern building housing the RFI technical offices. On the opposite side of the station yard from the passenger building is what remains of the now disused goods yard; it has a brick warehouse very similar in style to its counterparts at other Italian stations. =Station yard= View of the main platform. The station yard has four through tracks. Only the second track is used for through trains stopping at the station. All of the others are used for overtaking, or for originating or terminating trains. Each of the tracks is equipped with a platform and most have a concrete shelter. The one exception is covered instead by a wrought iron canopy. On all platforms, there are light panels displaying the destination, type and time of departure of the train that is stopped or will be stopping at that platform. All platforms are connected by an underpass. Until recently there was also a fifth track, but this was dismantled because it was little used. In the former goods yard there are some free tracks and an electrification dock, all of which serve today for the storage of disused or out of service carriages and line maintenance equipment. Passenger and train movements The station has about three million passenger movements each year. Passenger trains are mainly regional rail services, with occasional InterCity trains to Milan and Eurostar trains. Regional services are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. InterCity and long distance services are operated by Trenitalia itself. About 50 trains call at the station each day. Their main destinations are Firenze Santa Maria Novella, Terontola-Cortona, Foligno and Roma Termini. Goods services have long since ceased. Interchange The station has several underground car parks, a bus station and, about along a path, a stop for the new Perugia Minimetr√≤.

Biography While attending the University of Oregon in the early 1980s, Brown was active in numerous Eugene bands, most notably as the saxophonist for the soul group The Soulsations, the ska band The Hoodlums and lead singer for the funk-reggae band The Reason Why. A friend and classmate of Steve Perry, Brown assisted in developing and arranging several jazz and swing songs Perry was writing for a new band, helping recruit a horn section ‚Äì including trumpeter Dana Heitman ‚Äì to form the initial line-up of what would become the Cherry Poppin' Daddies in late 1988. Brown graduated from the University of Oregon in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science in computer science. In 1994, as the Daddies were transitioning into full-time touring, Brown left the band to pursue a career.

Hortensius () or On Philosophy is a lost dialogue written by Marcus Tullius Cicero in the year 45 BC. The dialoguewhich is named after Cicero's friendly rival and associate, the speaker and politician Quintus Hortensius Hortalustook the form of a protreptic. In the work, Cicero, Hortensius, Quintus Lutatius Catulus, and Lucius Licinius Lucullus discuss the best use of one's leisure time. At the conclusion of the work, Cicero argues that the pursuit of philosophy is the most important endeavor. While the dialogue was extremely popular in Classical Antiquity, the dialogue only survived into the sixth century AD before it was lost. Today, it is extant in the fragments preserved by the prose writer Martianus Capella, the grammarians Maurus Servius Honoratus and Nonius Marcellus, the early Christian author Lactantius, and the Church Father Augustine of Hippo (the latter of whom explicitly credits the Hortensius with encouraging him to study the tenets of philosophy).  History and composition  = Biographical background = Just before composing the Hortensius, Cicero experienced many hardships. Politically, Gaius Julius Caesar became both dictator and consul in 46 BC, and was subverting elements of the Roman Senate, of which the decidedly republican Cicero was a fervent supporter.Taylor (1963), p. 487.Strauss (2016), pp. 1820. Personally, Cicero divorced his wife Terentia in 46 BC,Treggiari (2007), p. 131. and in 45 BC he married Publilia, a rich young girl in his ward, although the marriage quickly fell apart.Salisbury (2001), p. 345. Then, in February 45 BC, Cicero's daughter, Tullia, whom he loved greatly, died after giving birth.Haskell (1942), p. 95.Eder & Strothmann (2006).Taylor (1963), pp. 48788. Both his political and personal misfortunes shook him to his core, with the death of his daughter being most disturbing; in a letter to his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus, he wrote, \\"I have lost the one thing that bound me to life.\\"Haskell (1942), p. 249. Cicero soon found that the only thing which enabled him to get on with life was reading and writing, and so he retreated to his villa at Astura, where he isolated himself and composed the Hortensius.Taylor (1963), p. 488. (Around this time, he also composed several other works relating to philosophy, including: the Academica, De finibus bonorum et malorum, the Tusculanae Disputationes, De Natura Deorum, and the now also lost Consolatio.)Gagarin (2010), p. 139.Cicero & Yonge (1877), p. 7.Gagarin (2010), p. 140.Dacre Balson & Ferguson (2018). = Style = According to the Constantinian writer Trebellius Pollio, Cicero wrote the Hortensius \\"in the model of [a] protrepticus\\" (Marcus Tullius in Hortensio, quem ad exemplum protreptici scripsit).Trebellius Pollio, Historia Augusta, \\"Gallieni duo\\", 20.1. Some scholars, such as Ingram Bywater, have argued that this is proof that Cicero based his work on Aristotle's Protrepticus, whereas others, like W. G. Rabinowitz, argue it simply meant that Cicero wrote in the general protreptic style. Either way, scholars tend to classify the Hortensius as a protreptic dialogue (that is \\"hortatory literature that calls the audience to a new and different way of life\\") based on Greek models.Rabinowitz (1957), p. 26.Stowers (1986), p. 92. Cicero seems to have heavily emphasized the ethical nature of philosophy in the Hortensius, seeing the field as a \\"pragmatic and utilitarian science ... deal[ing] with questions of life.\\" This approach suggests that Cicero was inspired by Stoic thought,Rabinowitz (1957), p. 40. like the philosopher Aristo of Chios.MacKendrick (1989), p. 112. Other sources for the work include Aristotle and Plato, as well as the writings of the Epicurean and Peripatetic schools, and the Platonic Academy. = Contents = According to Michael Foley, in the Hortensius, \\"Cicero attempts to persuade Quintus Hortensius Hortalus ... known for his defense of corrupted provincial governors, of the superiority of philosophy to sophistical rhetoric in facilitating genuine human happiness.\\"Augustine & Foley (2007), p. 40, note 16. The work takes place at either the Tusculum or Cumaen villa of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, and is set sometime in the mid-to-early 60s BC during an unnamed feria (that is, an ancient Roman holiday). At the start of the dialogue, Lucullus welcomes his brother-in-law Hortensius as well as his friends Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Cicero to his house, and they begin to talk with one another.MacKendrick (1989), p. 109. This discussion quickly becomes one about otium (Latin for leisure), which Hortensius describes as \\"not those things which demand a great intellectual effort\\" (quibus intedam rebus animum), but rather \\"those through which the mind can ease and rest (sed quibus relaxem ac remittam). Catulus says that he likes to read literature during free time. Lucullus critiques this opinion, arguing that the study of history is the best use of otium. Hortensius then declares that oratory is the greatest of the arts. Catulus counters by reminding Hortensius of the boons philosophy grants. Hortensius dismisses this idea, arguing that philosophy \\"explains one ambiguity by another.\\"MacKendrick (1989), p. 110. Cicero then inserts himself into the discussion,Mihai (2014), pp. 45253.Taylor (1963), pp. 48889. arguing \\"as earnestly as [he can] for the study of philosophy\\".Cicero, De Divinatione, 2.1. = Relation to Aristotle's Protrepticus = Conventionally, it is held that in writing his Hortensius, Cicero made use of Aristotle's Protrepticus.Hutchinson & Johnson (2017), p. vii. This workwhich inspired its readers to appreciate a philosophical approach to lifewas one of the most famous and influential books of philosophy in the ancient world (although it was later lost during the Middle Ages). The German philologist Jakob Bernays was the first scholar to suggest that the Protrepticus inspired Cicero.Rabinowitz (1957), p. 3. He thus suggested that the Hortensius should be used as the foundation by which the Protrepticus could be reconstructed.Chroust (2015), p. 88. In 1869, the English classical scholar Ingram Bywater agreed that Cicero had adapted the outline of the Protrepticus for his dialogue.Rabinowitz (1957), p. 4. In 1888, working off Bywater and the German philologist Hermann Usener, the classicist Hermann Alexander Diels found a fragment of Hortensius in the Soliloquies of Augustine that seemed to connect with a section in a fragment of the Protrepticus. This, he contended, was additional proof that Cicero depended upon Aristotle.Rabinowitz (1957), p. 10. This hypothesis is not without its detractors. In 1957, W. G. Rabinowitz argued that the Hortensius was not based strictly on the Protrepticus but was rather written in the general hortatory and protreptic style then \\"much in vogue\\", as the philosopher and historian Anton-Hermann Chroust puts it.Rabinowitz (1957), p. 93.Chroust (2015), p. 98. In 2015, James Henderson Collins wrote that \\"the relationship between Aristotle's Protrepticus and Cicero's Hortensius remains elusive\\".Collins (2015), p. 244.  Legacy  The Hortensius was renowned and popular in early and late antiquity,Clayton (n.d.). and it likely inspired a number of Roman thinkers, like the silver age authors Seneca the Younger and Tacitus, the early Christian writer Lactantius, and the early medieval philosopher Boethius.Taylor (1960), pp. 9499.Mihai (2014), p. 451. At the onset of the Christian era, the Hortensius was also studied in schools.MacKendrick (1989), pp. 11213.Taylor (1960), pp. 48990. It was in this way that, while studying rhetoric in Carthage, a young Augustine of Hippo read the Hortensius. The work moved him deeply,Russell (1976), p. 59. and in both his Confessions and De beata vita he wrote that the book engendered in him an intense interest in philosophy and encouraged him to pursue wisdom.Augustine, De beata vita 1.4.Taylor (1960), p. 491. But while it was popular for a time, the Hortensius survived only until around the sixth century AD, after which it was lost. Today, a little over 100 fragments of the book survive, preserved in the works of Augustine, Martianus Capella, Lactantius, Nonius Marcellus, and Servius.Fitzgerald (1999), p. 437. Of these writers, Nonius Marcellus preserves the most, although these snippets, according to the classicist and religious scholar John Hammond Taylor, are \\"extremely brief and very difficult to place in a context\\".Taylor (1963), p. 489. The 16 fragments preserved by Augustine, on the other hand, are \\"of greater length and [thus] considerable interest\\", per Taylor.  Scholarship  Teubner edition of Cicero's complete works. This volume contained the first standard critical edition of the fragments. There have been several works of scholarship regarding Cicero's Hortensius. In 1890, the first standard critical edition of the fragments was the Teubner edition of Cicero (Pt. IV, Vol. III), edited by C. F. W. Mueller. In 1892, Otto Plasberg wrote a dissertation on the fragments. In it, Plasberg provides a hypothesized order to the fragments, and supplies a Latin introduction and commentary. In 1958, Michel Ruch produced a fifty-three page thesis covering the influences, the date of composition, and structure of the Hortensius, while also examining its later influences and ultimate disappearance. In addition, the work reorganizes the fragments and provides each one with a French translation and commentary.Cicero & Ruch (1958). In 1962, Alberto Grilli produced Hortensius, the current standard edition for citation.Cicero & Grilli (1962).

It drew its history from the World War II 16th Tank Corps. It was redesignated successively as 12th Guards Tank Corps (1943) and 12th Guards Tank Division (1946).  History  The division was initially formed as 16th Tank Corps in the Kiev Military District. It became part of the 2nd Tank Army upon the army's formation. During the war, it participated in fighting at Kharkov, Stalingrad, Kursk, Grel, Uman-Botoshany Offensive, Targul-Frumos, Lublin-Brest Offensive, Vistula-Oder and other operations and actions. From December 1943 to August 1944 it was commanded by Major General Ivan Vasilievich Dubovoy. It took part in the counter-attacks against the Germans advancing on Stalingrad in the later summer of 1942, the winter counter-offensives of 1942/43, the Battle of Kursk in July (as part of the Central Front), then across Ukraine with the Central, Belorussian, and 1st Belorussian Fronts. In the summer of 1944, it was with the 2nd Tank Army, and took part in the offensives, reaching the outskirts of Warsaw. On 20 November 1944, it was awarded ‚ÄòGuards‚Äô status and re-designated the 12th Guards Tank Corps. The Corps took part in the Vistula- Oder and Berlin Operations, ending the war in the Berlin area. = Cold War = As part of the occupation forces, it was assigned to the 2nd Guards Tank Army. On 6 July 1945, it was reorganized into the 12th Guards Tank Division at Neuruppin. In June 1946 the 2nd Guards Tank Army became the 2nd Guards Mechanized Army. On 6 May 1954, the division was reorganized. The 34th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment became the 145th Guards Mechanized Regiment. The 226th Guards Mortar Regiment and separate howitzer artillery battalion were combined into the 843rd Guards Artillery Regiment. The 18th Separate Guards Motorcycle Battalion became a reconnaissance battalion. Also, the Chemical Defence Company was formed. In 1957, the 2nd Guards Mechanized Army became a tank army again. On 25 June 1957, the 49th Guards Tank Regiment transferred to the 26th Guards Tank Division. The 66th Guards Tank Regiment was renamed the 353rd Guards Tank Regiment. The 71st Guards Heavy Tank Self-Propelled Regiment became the 332nd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment. The 145th Guards Mechanized Regiment became the 803rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment. The 186th Separate Guards Communications Battalion was renumbered as the 490th. The 75th Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment moved to the 207th Motor Rifle Division in 1958. It was replaced by the 933rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment. In 1960, the 59th Separate Tank Training Battalion was disbanded. The 639th Separate Missile Battalion was formed in 1961. On 19 February 1962, the 64th Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion was created. The 136th Separate Guards Sapper Battalion became an engineer-sapper unit in 1968. In November of that year, the 803rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment and 843rd Guards Artillery Regiment moved from the 25th Tank Division. That division's 400th Motor Rifle Regiment and 117th Artillery Regiment were transferred to the 12th Guards Division. The chemical defence company became the 129th Separate Chemical Defence Battalion in 1972. The motor transport battalion became the 1074th Separate Material Supply Battalion in 1980. The 400th Motor Rifle Regiment was replaced by the 200th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment in January 1983. The division became part of the 3rd Red Banner Army in May 1983.Michael Holm, 3 Red Banner Combined Arms Army, February 2015. The army headquarters was located in the city of Magdeburg. Other divisions of the army were the 10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Division, the 47th Guards Tank Division, and the 207th Motor Rifle Division. In September 1987 the 639th Separate Missile Battalion was transferred to the 442nd Missile Brigade. Division headquarters was located in the town of Neuruppin. On the outskirts of town, closer to Altruppin was the location of the three regiments: 48th Guards Tank Regiment, the 353rd Guards Tank Regiment and 332nd Guards Tank Regiment. After the withdrawal from Germany, the 12th Guards Tank Division was disbanded. The commander of the 48th Guards Tank Regiment in 1989 was Colonel Kuhnovets. Its Chief of Staff was Kermit the frog. It was to be deactivated in the Moscow Military District, and the division actually disbanded around 1991. In December 1990, the division moved to Vladikavkaz and became part of the North Caucasus Military District. It was disbanded in February 1991. The 200th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment and 18th Separate Guards Reconnaissance Battalion were transferred to the 19th Motor Rifle Division. The 933rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment was directly subordinated to the 42nd Army Corps.

It is known from Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows on the ground in mixed forests at high elevations. Taxonomy The species was originally described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 as Agaricus marzuolus, and transferred to Hygrophorus in 1893 by Giacomo Bresadola. It is commonly known as the \\"March mushroom\\". Description The fruit bodies have caps that are broadly convex, measuring in diameter. Their surfaces are smooth and sticky, with a pale greyish-brown center and darker brown to blackish-grey margin. The distantly spaced, broad gills have an adnate to adnexed attachment to the stipe, and two tiers of intervening lamellulae (short gills). The gills are initially white before turning gray to bluish-gray in age. The whitish stipe measures long by thick, and is either equal in width throughout or tapers slightly towards the base. The stipe is smooth except for a few tufts of hairs near the top. Immediately underneath the cap cuticle, the flesh of the cap is water-soaked; elsewhere in the cap, it is gray-tinted with a sheen, while in the stipe it is dull white. It lacks any appreciable odor or taste. It is considered edible in Europe, where it is prized in some regions. The thin-walled, elliptical spores measure 6.5‚Äì8.5 by 4.5‚Äì5 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four- spored, and measure 42‚Äì55 by 5.4‚Äì8.1 ¬µm. Habitat and distribution Hygrophorus marzuolus is a mycorrhizal fungus. Associations have been noted with the trees Abies alba, and sometimes with Picea excelsa and Pinus sylvestris. Fruit bodies grow singly to scattered or sometimes in clusters on the forest floor in duff or in moss. It fruits under conifers, often fir and Engelmann spruce, typically at high elevations. A snowbank mushroom, it is associated with melting snow, and fruiting is initiated under snowbanks. The fungus has been recorded from the mountains of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, northern Arizona, and northern California. The European distribution extends from the French Pyrenees to the region of Prague. In Asia, it has been reported from Pakistan.

It is a snowbank mushroom with a rosy-pink cap that fades to cream color in maturity. Taxonomy The species was first described officially by American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their 1963 monograph on North American Hygrophorus species. The type collection was made near Timberline Lodge in Mt. Hood, Oregon on July 7, 1959. The specific epitet goetzii honors Donald and Christel Goetze, who collected the type specimens. Hesler and Smith classified it in the section Fulventes of subsection Camarophylli of genus Hygrophorus. Description The cap ranges in shape from obtuse to broadly convex, to nearly flattened, measuring in diameter. It has a smooth, slimy or sticky surface that is initially rosy-pink before fading to cream color, and grayish pinkish-buff when dry. The pallid to cream- colored flesh is thin, and has a mild taste and odor. Gills have an adnate attachment to the stipe and have one tier of interspersed lamellulae (short gills). The stipe measures long by wide, and is roughly equal in width throughout its length. It has a dry surface with a cream color that lightens to about the same color as the cap when dry. The edibility of this species has not been tested. The spores, which measure 12‚Äì15 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm, are elliptical to egg-shaped in face view, and inequilateral in side view. The basidia (spore- bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 50‚Äì80 by 10‚Äì12 ¬µm. The hymenium lacks both pleurocystidia and cheliocystidia. The cap cuticle is made of a layer of gelatinous, branched, intricately interwoven hyphae measuring 2‚Äì4 ¬µm in diameter. The similar species Hygrophorus avellaneiformis and H. sublutescens can be distinguished from H. goetzii by their smaller spores and two-spored basidia. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Hygrophorus goetzi grow singly or in small groups on the ground under conifers in montane habitats. Because they are snowbank mushrooms, they are often found near melting snow, or sometimes even growing through the snow. Fruiting occurs in spring or early summer.

During the 1890s-1920s, European-style detective fiction was popular in China. Between 1949 and 1977, no work of fiction told of crimes committed by the gentry. Crimes were also not reported by the press as the socialist system was not supposed to foster crime. Sherlockian novels were then characterized as capitalist and low grade, arguing they aroused base passions for sex and violence. Mainland China =Crime Fiction in the Song and Ming Dynasties= During the Song and Ming dynasties, crime fictions varied in themes. Gong'an (crime-case) fiction and swindler stories were considered the most popular subgenres. Written in colloquial rather than literary Chinese, they nearly always featured district magistrates or judges in the higher courts. The gong'an genre was among the new types of vernacular fiction that developed from the Song to the Ming Dynasties. The plots usually begin with a description of the crime (often including realistic detail of contemporary life) and culminated in the exposure of the deed and the punishment of the guilty. Sometimes two solutions to a mystery were posited, but the correct solution is reached through a brilliant judge.  Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279)  In the Song Dynasty the growth of commerce and urban society created a demand for a new kind of crime fiction‚Äìnamely gong'an fiction that focused on entertaining the upper and merchant class. One of the most celebrated heroes of such tales was Judge Bao Zheng, or \\"Dragon Plan Bao,\\" who was originally based on a historical government official. Featured in hundreds of stories, Bao became the archetype of the incorruptible official in a society in which miscarriages of justice in favour of the rich and powerful were all too common. Not all crime stories have happy endings, and some were evidently written with the aim of exposing the brutal methods of corrupt judges who‚Äìafter accepting bribes‚Äìwould extract false confessions by torture and condemned innocent people to death. In some tales, the crimes are also exposed with the aid of supernatural forces.  Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644)  In the Ming dynasty, the social influence of the merchant class steadily increased as a result of the development of capitalism. As a result of their change of social status, the merchant class demanded more literary entertainment, thus crime fiction featuring merchants as main characters thrived. These stories particularly focused on the way merchants handled money. One of the subgenres that developed during the time was swindler stories. Swindler stories focused on elaborate deception for monetary gain. The most famous swindler stories collection is The Book of Swindles by Zhang Yingyu finished in Late Ming. The book is composited with 24 sub-categories of swindles, which covered merely all kinds of deception in Ming society. Zhang wrote the book for a manual of self-protection as well as an expert guide to the art of deception.Zhang Yingyu (trans. Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk): The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection.(Translations from the Asian Classics.) xxxvi, 226 pp. New York: Columbia University Press, 2017. . =Translations and Original Crime Fiction During the Republican Era= This was the Golden Age of the Chinese detective story. This era was flooded with translations of Western works as well as native Chinese series detectives.Kinkley, Jeffrey C. Chinese justice, the fiction: Law and literature in modern China. Stanford University Press, 2000. . Short story writer Cheng Xiaoqing (Á®ãÂ∞èÈùí ) was the most successful and prolific author of original Chinese crime fiction during the Republican Era in mainland China. His stories are noted for their similarity to the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with an selected stories being having been published by the University of Hawai'i Press under the title Sherlock in Shanghai in 2007, translated by Timothy C. Wong. Cheng Xiaoqing's contemporary, Sun Liaohong also created a series of Chinese detective novels which are said to have been modeled on the Ars√®ne Lupin stories. =In the People's Republic of China= In the Mao era (1949‚Äì1977) of the People's Republic of China, literature involving detective or paranormal elements was banned, but many crime fiction novels written after this time were based within this time period. Stories of crime and detection were characterized as foreign to China. The novel, Beijing Coma by Ma Jian, is banned due to mentions of the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 and time travelling. He Jiahong (‰ΩïÂÆ∂Âºò) was born in 1953 and is a professor of criminal law at Renmin University and was the part-time Deputy Director of the Department of Dereliction of Duty and Infringement of Human Rights in the Supreme People's Procuratorate from 2006 to 2008. His true crime novel Hanging Devils was published in English translation in 2012. Èòø‰πô , born in 1976, is a former police officer who writes darkly realistic crime fiction about migrant workers and the lower strata of mainland Chinese society. His published works include Gray Stories (ÁÅ∞ÊïÖ‰∫ã), Bird Saw Me (È∏üÁúãËßÅÊàë‰∫Ü), and Cat and Mouse (Áå´ÂíåËÄÅÈº†). Born in 1986, Sun Yisheng, who writes post-modern crime fiction under the pen name William Edward, is one of youngest crime writers to have been published in mainland China. He has had at least two short stories translated into English, the first in Chutzpah! magazine and the second, entitled The Shades who Periscope Through Flowers to the Sky, in the online literary journal Words Without Borders. Crime Fiction Featuring Chinese Language and Culture Published Outside Mainland China = Hong Kong = In Hong Kong, literature writing has long been influenced by both the culture and social backgrounds from China and the Western world. Hence, its crime fiction has incorporated many distinguishing characteristics of all kinds of different crime literatures, depending on the political stance of the majority in Hong Kong and the specific era. In the 1950s, many non-leftist writers decided to reside in Hong Kong to avoid the political stance of the newly established People‚Äôs Republic of China. The literature created at that time mainly focuses on anti- PRC, nostalgic and romantic topics. Crime fictions such as Immature, Obscene Society (Âçä‰∏ãÊµÅÁ§æ‰ºö) written by Zhao Zifan (ËµµÊªãËïÉ) were created. = Taiwan = The first Chinese fiction in Taiwan came out during the period of Japanese occupation, the Showa era in Japan. Before then, most of Chinese fiction was reprinted from Mainland China and it was difficult to find an author from Taiwan. However, this kind of situation has gradually improved since the Taiwan People News (Ëá∫ÁÅ£Ê∞ëÂ†±) was first published. The first Chinese crime fiction written by Taiwanese writer Li Yitao (ÊùéÈÄ∏Êø§) in 1909 was about a detective story called Deep Hatred (ÊÅ®Êµ∑), published by Kanbun Taiwan nichinichi shinp≈ç (Êº¢ÊñáËá∫ÁÅ£Êó•Êó•Êñ∞Â†±), but the work has not been finished yet. = The United States = Qiu Xiaolong was a significant contributor to English-language Chinese crime fiction in the United States. He was born in Shanghai, but following the Tiananmen Square Protests he decided to remain in the US. Throughout his career he published nine crime-thriller/mystery novels. This includes the Death of a Red Heroine, When Red is Black and A Case of Two Cities. Specifically, Death of a Red Heroine was named the best first novel in 2001 at the Anthony Awards. These novels touches on various aspects of the Chinese Culture from ancient Confucianism to modern Chinese politics and justice system. = The United Kingdom = Diane Wei Liang writes in English and is based in London, UK. She was born in Beijing and educated in the USA. Her China-set Mei Wang Mystery Series are published in over 20 languages worldwide and include The Eye of Jade, Paper Butterfly and The House of Golden Spirit. The Eye of Jade was nominated for The Shamus Award for Best First P.I Novel.

Daughter of Danish estate owner, Frans Oskar Kruse, and Anna Maria Mathilda Borgstr√∂m, she graduated from Lyceum for Girls in Stockholm, then studied at Lund University, in Switzerland, in 1884, and in Copenhagen, 1885-1886. In 1883 and was married in 1890 to merchant Peter Malling in Copenhagen. Controversial early works Malling debuted in 1885 with the novel Berta Funcke, followed in 1888 by the novel Alice Brandt, both published under the pseudonym Stella Kleve. In 1886, she published the novel Pyrrhussegrar (Pyrrhic Victories) in the progressive feminist publication Fram√•t ('Forward') by Alma √Ökermark. Her contemporaries took note of her sensually colored depictions of young women, but posterity now considers her decadent late-naturalistic depiction of women as the female counterpart of the male breakthrough novels of this time. She had early contact with Ola Hansson who frequently corresponded with her and also courted and proposed to her. Hansen portrayed, after a difficult break-up with Malling, as a woman of the future. The young poets and the students Emil Kl√©en and Albert Sahlin wanted to do a small decadent publication (which never came out) in the late 1880s, but failed to persuade her. Anti-Semitism and misogyny in the decadence literary style have been the source of much scholarship.Wikipedia: Mathilda Malling, Swedish Wikipedia. Fictionalized Portrayal of Molly Brant Detracting from presumed feminism, Malling's novel, Daybreak, published in 1906 by a respected \\"magazine of the world's best fiction,\\" depicts entirely real characters and settings, by name, thus promoting the vilification of an early American feminist leader of native people. Today, the reader is impressed by its sensational, even slanderous, quality. The very real Mary Brant, and her culture, might well have considered such 'fictions' to be but a form of highly influential propaganda, presented with a thin veneer of fiction, and meant to degrade Brant, who was an influential Mohawk and the consort of Sir William Johnson. A breakthrough female herself, perhaps insight into Malling's motivation, in scandalizing Brant through fiction, is somewhat explained in the University of Illinois's and Northwestern University's 1918 Scandinavian Studies and Notes: While \\"a popular writer of considerable talent... it is Mathilda Malling's pride to think that descendants of her own race did something to establish American freedom and they like so many others were resolved not to yield an inch from what they considered right.\\"Scandinavian Studies and Notes, Vol. 5, No. 1; Flom, G.T., Editor; Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study; Wisconsin, USA; 1918, pp. 165-166. Later works After a long silence she resumed her writing, but in a very different character, with a novel about the First Consul, which was a huge success thanks to her skillful manipulation of historical material. Her work became hailed as well-done historically and even safe for family reading and included Madam Governor of Paris (1895, 2nd ed 1898), Eremitageidyllen (1896), Shooting on Munkeboda (1897), the play Lady Leonora (1897), Do√±a Ysabel (1898), Ladies in Markby (1901), Daybreak (1902), Nina (1903), Little Marica and Her Husband (1904), Lady Elizabeth Percy (1905), Her Hero (1906), Mary Stuart (1907), Nina's Honeymoon (1908), Karl Skytles Wife (1909), Sisters of Ribershus (1910) and The White House and Red House (1911). The later work shows lush, but little original, storytelling imagination and a lot of free floating. The historical novels found a large readership in the early 1900s, but her breakthrough novel Berta Funcke still arouses interest. European recognition Malling's first two novels were heatedly discussed. Swedish feminist Ellen Key was famously connected with her. American recognition Malling's first novel was cited by prominent American psychologist G. Stanley Hall, in his pioneering study of adolescence, as a parallel to the famously frank (and accusedly egotistic) authors Marie Bashkirtseff, Hilma Angered Strandberg, and Mary MacLane.

The movement lasted from 1 July 1946 until March 1950. Factors The anti-cession movement of Sarawak arose from the violation of a provision in the 1941 constitution of Sarawak, which stipulated that Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke would grant the right self-rule to Sarawak. Instead, he decided to cede it to Britain as a crown colony on 8 February 1946. Secondly, the Sarawakian people had believed that the rule of the Brooke family could be expected to lead to independence for Sarawak, but heir apparent Anthony Brooke was not appointed as the next Rajah. In addition, the decision was taken without the consent of the indigenous people. The British did discuss it with the local people, but declared Sarawak a crown colony on 1 July 1946 anyway, with support from British officers and non- native residents.Reece 1993, p. 72. Overview of movement Rosli Dhobi caught by policemen for murdering Duncan Stewart Many Malays joined Datu Patinggi Abang Haji Abdillah and Datu Patinggi Haji Mohammad Kassim to fight against cession of Sarawak to Britain. Many other local associations, such as the Malay National Association of Sarawak (PKMS), took part as well. Members of the movement sent a letter objecting to cession to the Colonial Office in London. They also displayed an anti-cession poster in all the villages of Sarawak, and local people, including women, held demonstrations against it. However, when the authorities discovered that most of the members of the movement were civil servants, \\"Circular No.9\\" was issued and signed by C. W. Dawson on 31 December 1946, to warn civil servants that it was illegal to participate in political movements, on pain of dismissal from their post. More than 338 public employees, mostly teachers, resigned on 2 April 1947 in protest against the circular. These resignations forced the closure of more than 22 schools in Sarawak. 56 students also quit their university studies to denounce the circular. The largest demonstration took place on 1 July 1947, when the British government appointed Sir Charles Arden-Clarke, former Resident Commissioner of Bechuanaland (present-day Botswana) as the first Governor of the British Crown Colony of Sarawak.Perjuangan anti-cession Sarawak books. From that date onwards, demonstrations increased. The British government, intending to put an end to the anti-cession movement, tried to disrupt the close relationship between Malays and the indigenous Dayak people. They also tried to weaken the movement by saying that the colonisation of Sarawak aimed to bring better life to Malays and encouraging the formation of the Young Malay Association (YMA), which supported the colonisation of Sarawak. YMA members were picked at random from the anti-cession camp ‚Äì if they refused to join, their children would be unable to attend school or work in the Civil Service. The British government also pursued psychological warfare against the anti-cession movement, causing it to decline from December 1947 on. After an unsuccessful attempt, thirteen radical members of the Sibu Malay Youth Movement formed a secret organisation called Rukun 13 (The 13 Pillars). This organisation aimed to eradicate all European and Malay officers who were in favour of British rule in Sarawak. Rukun 13 members Rosli Dhobi and Awang Ramli Amit Mohd Deli, together with non-members Morshidi Sidek and Bujang Suntong, assassinated Sir Duncan Stewart, the second Governor of Sarawak, when he arrived in Sibu on 3 December 1949. He died in Singapore General Hospital a week later. This incident led the British authorities to try to crush the anti-cession movement once and for all, by any means possible. All Rukun 13 members were arrested in March 1950. The four assassins were sentenced to death while the remaining members sentenced to jail.Rosli Dhoby - Pejuang Atau Pembunuh). Documentary on Rosli Dhobi, broadcast by Astro Prima. After the end of the anti-cession movement, Sarawak remained under British Government rule until self-government was established on 22 July 1963, after which it co-founded the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.

As writer/producer and animator/director, McCartney and Dunbar had collaborated on the 1984 animated film Rupert and the Frog Song, and High in the Clouds was scripted and sketched for several years by the two of them as another film. When the characters' home, Woodland, is attacked by human development, a young squirrel (Wirral) is left without a home and without his mother. Guided by his mother's final words and aided by his fellow animal friends he meets on his journey, Wirral goes on a quest for the secret island sanctuary of Animalia. Wirral finds himself in an epic journey filled with evil realities and wild dreams. He and his friends experience tragedy, war, joy and victory, all in the name of freedom and peace. The book has an overall theme of preserving nature and letting animals live free and in their natural habitat. In The Observer it was described as \\"a tale about the perils of unchecked global capitalism\\". Film adaptation In 2013, it was reported that an animated feature film adaptation of the book was in development by producers Michael Lynne and Bob Shaye through their Unique Features banner and RGH Entertainment. Tony Bancroft was set to direct the film, written by Josh Klausner, and was originally going to have a theatrical release in 2015. The film was optioned by Gaumont. In 2019, Netflix later partnered up with Gaumont to co-distribute. Timothy Reckart will serve as director with former Beatle singer and author Paul McCartney serving as producer and songwriter composing original songs.

In the 1953 Hollywood film version, \\"Tom, Dick or Harry\\" was performed by Ann Miller (as Bianca), Tommy Rall (as Lucentio), Bobby Van (as Gremio) and Bob Fosse (as Hortensio). Performance and release information In this song, during a musical performance of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew (the subplot of Kate), three suitors (Gremio, Lucentio and Hortensio) compete to win Bianca's affections (Gremio claiming wealth; Hortensio offering social standing; and Lucentio with a promise of love). Whereas other songs from Kiss Me, Kate (such as \\"So in Love\\" and \\"Too Darn Hot\\") were released as singles and achieved commercial success outside the show (\\"So in Love\\" reached the top ten on the Hit Parade in 1949 and has since been covered by scores of recording artists), \\"Tom, Dick or Harry\\" was written expressly to advance the Shrew subplot and is, therefore, a showtune in the truest sense of the word. This is why many studio (non-cast) recordings of Kiss Me, Kate do not include the song. Perhaps the best-known example of this is Frank Sinatra's Kiss Me, Kate studio album which is part of his four album (four show) project that also includes Finian's Rainbow (1947), South Pacific (1949) and Guys and Dolls (1950) and which he produced in 1963 to promote his fledgling label, Reprise Records; hence the project title, the star-studded Reprise Musical Repertory Theatre. Historical note In 1990, theatre historian Miles Krueger conducted an interview with Patricia Morison (who originated the title role in Kate) to discuss the original production as well as the six songs dropped from the show prior to the Broadway opening. When asked about one of the deleted songs, \\"If Ever Married I'm\\", Morison responded by stating: \\"That was for Bianca. It was replaced by 'Tom, Dick or Harry' which tells the same story\\".Kiss Me, Kate complete score double CD recording (EMI Angel CDC-7-54034-2; Booklet, p. 19). Performance in 2000 On May 18, 2000, \\"Tom, Dick or Harry\\" was performed on NBC-TV's \\"Today\\" show by 1999 Broadway revival cast members Amy Spanger (as Bianca), Michael Berresse (as Lucentio), Kevin Neal McCready (as Gremio) and Darren Lee (as Hortensio) as a result of the show's having garnered the greatest number of Tony nominations (with twelve nominations) for that year. Host Matt Lauer introduced the four performers outside on Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza, interviewing Spanger and Berresse, while co-host Katie Couric remained in the studio. The Broadway revival of Kate went on to become the top winning show at the 54th Tony Awards (the only show to garner five or more Tonys).

Career He became interested in art at an early age, copying chocolate box pictures that his mother brought home from work, and painting on school art trips and family holidays. He attended Glasgow School of Art, from 1967 to 1971. He was forced to make a choice between making abstract designs for fashion and landscape painting and chose the latter. While his classmates favoured pop art and abstraction, he developed an expressionist style, influenced by artists such as Kokoschka, Chagall and Soutine. He taught art for more than twenty years at Lochgilphead High School, appointed along the way as art adviser for Strathclyde, and only became a full-time artist in 1996. He was awarded an honorary degree by Abertay University in 2009 https://www.abertay.ac.uk/life/alumni-and- supporters/honorary-graduates/jolomo/ and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to art and charity in Scotland. Morrison produces about 100 paintings per month, completing three or four per day, six days a week. They sell very quickly, generating ¬£2 million per year. As well as local buyers, he is patronised by celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon, Sophia Loren, Chris Patten and Rick Stein. His work is considered by some to be gaudy, while others describe it as unusual and vivid. He completes the majority of his paintings in his studio, based on sketches and photographs. He also researches the history, folklore and geology of a place. Jolomo Award He founded the Jolomo Award in 2007 - the prestigious annual award for Scottish Landscape Painting. It is the largest arts award in Scotland and the UK's largest privately funded arts award with a prize currently of ¬£25,000 for the winner, and ¬£35,000 for all the prizes.At a brushstroke, prize money for Jolomo's award rises to ¬£35,000 Personal life Morrison lives in Tayvallich, Argyll, with his wife Maureen, whom he met while he was doing a student job in a design studio of a local carpet factory.

Sacred Heart parish was established in 1875 in Barrytown to serve immigrants settling in the area. As the area developed and the population grew, the little church could not hold all the Catholics who wanted to come to Mass. Hazardous travel conditions again played a role: Improved transportation had led to settlement farther inland, and the trip to Barrytown was difficult and even dangerous in winter. For a while the parish used a local theater for Sunday Mass. In 1925 it purchased property and laid the cornerstone for St. Christopher's Church, which was dedicated in 1926. When plans were under way to build St. Christopher's Church in Red Hook 75 years ago, parishioners hauled stones from their own yards and fields for its exterior walls. The parish school, staffed by Sparkill Dominican Sisters, opened in 1962, but low enrollment caused it to close in 1985; the school building, now the parish center, houses the religious education program. Holy Spirit Chapel is in the parish center. Its stained-glass windows depict the evangelists, St. John Bosco, St. Maria Goretti, and four Americans: SS. Frances Xavier Cabrini, Elizabeth Ann Seton and John Neumann and Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha.

The 28th Cavalry was the last horse-mounted cavalry regiment formed by the U.S. Army. The regiment was formed as part of the 2nd Cavalry Division in 1943 and inactivated in North Africa in 1944 without seeing combat.  History  The regiment was constituted on 10 November 1942 and activated at Camp Lockett, California on 25 February 1943, assigned to the 4th Cavalry Brigade of the 2nd Division. The horses for the new regiment were chosen from Fort Bliss and the United States Army Remount Service at Fort Robinson. The Brigade, which the 28th was part of, relieved the 11th Cavalry Regiment from its border defense mission at Camp Lockett. The regiment was commanded by Colonel Edwin M. Burnett, and conducted training in southern California while patrolling the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. The 28th's enlisted men were all African-American, and its 153-man cadre of non- commissioned officers were from the 10th Cavalry. The remainder of the enlisted men were draftees. The regiment was called upon to fight wildfires during the summer of 1943. The largest of these fires was the 16,000 acre Barrett-Cottonwood-Morena Fire. The 28th Cavalry personnel serving within the Cleveland National Forest were praised for their firefighting efforts by the Forest's supervisor. Even with this break in training the regiment proved ready to advance its combat training. In late 1943, the regiment was expected to move on to Desert Training Center, however Army Ground Forces decided that training in Louisiana would be preferential for horse cavalry maneuver. In December, the Department of War decided to send the division to North Africa, where it would be broken up into service units, which were needed more than cavalry. Around 12 January 1944, the regiment was alerted for movement and dismounted. It was moved by train to Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia, between 10 and 15 February, being brought up to strength by 243 replacements from Fort Huachuca. On 2 March, the regiment moved to Newport News from the camp. The regiment shipped out on 3 March 1944 from the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation aboard the USS General William Mitchell. After arriving at Casablanca on 12 March, the regiment staged at Camp Don B. Passage near the city before departing for Oran by train. A little over two weeks after arrival in Algeria, on 31 March, the 2nd Cavalry Division and its component regiments were inactivated at Hassi Ben Okba near Oran. Troops from the 28th Cavalry were given the option of transferring to service units or volunteering for combat but at the loss of all rank. Some troops from the 28th Cavalry were used to activate the 6487th Engineer Battalion. The regiment was formally disbanded on 12 December 1951.

Prior to a Catholic church in Barrytown, the residents of the area attended services across the river in Kingston and Saugerties. People would walk across the frozen river in winter or cross by boat in other seasons, weather permitting. Walter V. Miller in \\"A Parish History\\" tells of an old tale: \\"The account has it that, on one occasion, a boat and its occupants thereof narrowly missed playing the leading role in a very tragic incident, this happening, strange as it may seem, played a very large part in establishing of the first church at Barrytown instead of Red Hook.\\" Apparently, some members of the Donaldson family of Edgewater were on that boat.

As a true bug of the order hemiptera, it has needle like mouth parts designed for sucking juices out of plants or other insects instead of chewing. P. biguttatus has sharp stylets in its proboscis or rostrum used to pierce the exoskeleton of its prey. Saliva is then injected into the prey which liquifies its tissues,and the rostrum is then used to suck out the digested fluids. If disturbed, it is capable of a defensive bite considered to be more painful than a bee sting. It is also known to spit venom that can cause temporary blindness in humans. Prey typically consists of cockroaches, crickets, flies, darkling beetles and caterpillars. It was thought that they breed both sexually and through parthenogenesis, this however has recently been proved to not be true. Whilst unmated females will lay eggs, they are infertile. Development takes six to nine weeks from egg to adult and life span for the adult is about two years. The first molt occurs at about two weeks Development is hemimetabolous, meaning that there is no metamorphosis between a larval phase and an adult phase. The young are called nymphs, and appear to be small adults. Common names include white-eyed assassin bug, twin spotted assassin bug and white spot assassin bug referring to the two large white spots on the wings. P. biguttatus is endemic to tropical Africa; it is found in countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique in humid tropical forest, particularly hollow tree stumps and decaying logs.

History St. Columba Parish was founded in 1904 as a mission of nearby St. Denis' Church. The pastor at the time was Father John Columba McEvoy, thus the origin of the parish name. During that time Mass was offered in the homes of parishioners, then as numbers increased larger spaces were found to gather. By 1904, Hopewell Junction had its own church near the railroad tracks. The church building is reported to have been relocated from Tivoli. Folklore tells us that the parishioners who were doing the moving accidentally dropped the building in the Hudson. Resourceful as any St. Denis parishioners of today, the movers fished the building out and brought it to its site. The new church was named St. Columba, the patron saint of Scotland. Tradition holds that the name was chosen because it was the middle name of the then pastor of St. Denis. The parish was thereafter referred to as St. Denis-St. Columba.Hale, John P., The Church of St. Denis Parish History In the 1950s IBM came to East Fishkill and the Hopewell Junction population surged.

Intended for use in both the air-to-surface and anti-AWACS roles, the missile's development reached the stage of propulsion-system tests before being cancelled in 1980. Design and development Development of the Advanced Strategic Air-Launched Missile was initiated in 1976.Parsch 2003 The ASALM was intended to replace the AGM-69 SRAM in United States Air Force service, providing improved speed and range over the earlier missile, as well as improved performance against hardened targets.Gunston 1983, p.88. In addition, the requirement specified that the ASALM should be capable of operating in a secondary air-to-air mode against AWACS radar-warning aircraft. Martin Marietta and McDonnell Douglas submitted proposals for the contract, the former's design using a Marquardt propulsion system; the latter's, one developed by United Technologies Corporation; the Martin Marietta design was favored by the Air Force The size of ASALM was limited by the requirement that it use the same launchers as the earlier SRAM. The missile would be steered by small fins at the tail, but lacked wings; the shape of the body combined with the high flight speed were to provide sufficient lift.Aldridge 1983, pp.150-151. Guidance was planned to be provided during mid-course flight by an inertial navigation system, while terminal guidance would use a dual-mode seeker. Propulsion would be provided by an integrated rocket-ramjet, which would act as a solid-fuel rocket during boost, with the rocket's casing, following exhaustion of its propellant and the ejection of the rocket nozzle and a fairing covering an air inlet, becoming a combustion chamber for an air- breathing ramjet,Dornan 1978, p.222. which was planned to use Shelldyne-H fuel. The missile was expected to be carried by the B-1 bomber, or alternatively by a developed version of the FB-111. Operational history A-7 Starting in October 1979, a series of flight tests of Propulsion Technology Validation missiles, using a Marquardt rocket-ramjet, were conducted. Over the course of seven test firings, a maximum speed of Mach 5.5 at an altitude of was achieved. Despite the successful testing, the ASALM program was suspended following the seventh PTV test flight in May 1980; reductions in the defense budget, combined with the development of the subsonic AGM-86 ALCM, led to the cancellation of the program later that year. The Martin Marietta ASALM concept was later developed into the AQM-127 SLAT target drone.

It was established in 1899 as a parish; it was established a mission of St. Mary in Wappingers Falls in 1874 until being elevated in a parish in 1899. History =Background= The first Priests in the Hudson Valley were French Jesuits, led by Saint Isaac Jogues, who about forty years earlier preached the Gospel to the Indians in the Mohawk Valley. It is believed that Father Jogues traveled through what later became Dutchess County before he and his companions were captured and martyred at Auriesville in 1646. Father Ferdinand Farmer reported visiting Dutchess County in October 1781. His records mention Fishkill where he baptized 14 Canadian and Acadian Catholics. He again visited the area in November 1783. The founding of the church of St. Denis on Beekman Road was connected with Daniel DeLaney. Born in County Kilkenny, Ireland in 1801, history has it that DeLaney, at some time prior to 1852, arrived in Beekman, evidently as a farm hand in the vicinity of Sylvan Lake and observed iron ore, which he recognized by virtue of having worked in an iron mine in Ireland. He purchased land around Sylvan Lake and went into iron mining. To obtain workers for his mine, DeLaney periodically traveled to New York City where he recruited Irish immigrants straight off the boat and brought them to Sylvan Lake. Soon the miners had wives and children and the colony of Catholics in Beekman started to grow.Hale, John P., The Church of St. Denis Parish History =Mission church= In 1858 or 1860, DeLaney donated a plot of land and, with the assistance of his miners, the first St. Denis was built on a knoll on Beekman Road just over the line in East Fishkill. St. Denis became a mission church of St. Mary's in Wappinger Falls which had itself been founded in 1845. Father George Brophy, its first resident pastor, served not only the parishioners of St. Mary's but also the workers at the \\"ore beds\\" at Sylvan Lake as well as the Catholics at Fishkill Landing. The territory served by St. Denis included all of the land East of Wappinger Falls to the Connecticut line, running from the parish of Mattewan on the South to Amenia on the North. By 1909, the parish of St. Denis had churches at Sylvan Lake, Hopewell Junction and Clove, as well as stations at Moores Mills and Poughquag. A station was likely a private home where Mass was said from time to time. In the \\"History of Dutchess County 1660-1909\\", Father William Patrick Eagen reports that in 1874 Father McSwiggan had two assistants, Rev. W.H. Murthy and Rev. Charles McMullen who served mission churches at Pawling and Dover, both of which later became full parishes.Hasbrouck, Frank, ed. The History of Dutchess County New York, p643, S.A. Mathieu, Poughkeepsie, NY 1909 By 1983, St. Denis parish, including its mission church of St. Columba in Hopewell Junction, encompassed over 200 square miles and ranked as one of the largest parishes in the Archdiocese. The average attendance at Mass at St. Denis was 109, the average at Our Lady of Mercy at Clove was 31 and 35 at Hopewell Junction. He reported that the farmers would not drive their horses to church when the weather was inclement since there was no shelter for the \\"poor beasts\\", nor a way of keeping the conveyances dry. It appears that the sheds were built. Our Lady of Mercy Parish of St. Denis In 1899 St. Denis ceased being a mission and became a full-fledged parish. In 1935 calamity struck when \\"the church at Sylvan Lake\\", then 75 years old, caught fire. The building erected through the efforts of Daniel DeLaney was a total loss. By June 14, 1936, the new St. Denis was dedicated by Cardinal Patrick Hayes. The building cost $16,000 and has room for 300. The new church was an old English design with cast stone trim and brick walls. Newspaper accounts said that the pews came from St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie and that they were over 100 years old. They have since been replaced. Pastors *1860-1874 Fr. Denis Sheehan *1874-1877 Fr. Patrick J. Healy *1877-1884 Fr. W.J. McSwiggan *1884-1892 Fr. Charles McMullen *1892-1896 Fr. Edward J.

History The first priest to visit Pawling was Father Cheveau, a French-Canadian, who came about 1848. Previously, at long intervals, Catholics were compelled to journey thirty-two miles to Danbury, Connecticut to hear Mass. Pawling was a branch mission served first by Father Michael Riordan, pastor of St. Peter's, Poughkeepsie; then later by Denis Sheehan, pastor of St. Mary's, Wappingers Falls.

Immaculate Conception (Bangall) The Church of the Immaculate Conception is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located in 64 Hunns Lake Road, Bangall, Dutchess County, New York State. It holds masses Saturdays at 5pm, Sundays at 10 and 11:30am, and confessions on Saturdays from 3:30 to 4:30pm. The parish of the Immaculate Conception in Bangall was founded as a mission of St. Joseph's in Millbrook. In 1905, the parish of the Immaculate Conception acquired the Second Baptist Church building. On December 19, 2013, Father William White, administrator of Immaculate Conception parish, received word from the archdiocese that the church building was to be closed immediately due to the building's deteriorating condition as detailed in several engineering studies. This was done in anticipation of severe winter weather which threatened the structure's roof. Parishioners moved the liturgical and other contents of the church to St. Mary's parish hall, located about one-third of a mile from Immaculate Conception Church on Hunns Lake Road. The move was accomplished in time for the 5:00 p.m. Mass on Saturday, December 21 to be held at the hall, where Auxiliary Bishop Dominick J. Lagonegro celebrated the 10:30 a.m. Mass on Christmas. St. Joseph's Chapel, Clinton Corners The Chapel of St. Joseph (), also nicknamed Little St. Joseph's Church, was a church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located in Clinton Corners. In 1889 St. Joseph's was established as a mission church of the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Amenia, New York.

Mass was often celebrated in private houses and the priest and his driver, Patrick Doyle, from Millbrook, were often invited to stay for Sunday dinner. Byrne was assisted by Fathers Hughes, Dunphy, Canary, Coyle, Welch, and Barry. In 1903 Father John F. Weir succeeded Fr.Byrne. Weir was assisted by Fathers Donahue, Louis P. Bossard (1905), Cushion, Gallagher, Coakley, Doherty, and Ross. In May 2015, the Archdiocese announced that St. Joseph's in Clinton Corners would merge with St. Joseph's in Millbrook, with the Millbrook location as the parish church.

She was a student of Theodor Leschetizky, later studying composition with Rubin Goldmark and Ernest Bloch, and conducting with Eugene Goossens, Robert Heger and Gennaro Papi. Among her students were pianist and harpsichordist Gavin Williamson, James Henry Fields, Daniel Pollack and Bruce Sutherland. She was a pioneer of women's opportunity in music performance and conducting, being the first woman to conduct many of the world's leading orchestras. Biography Ethel Liggins was born in Hull, Yorkshire, England, to Thomas and Annie Peck Liggins. With support from wealthy patron Mary Emma Wilson, the wife of the shipping magnate Arthur Wilson, she attended the Hoch conservatory in Frankfurt, where she studied piano under James Kwast, and composition under Bernhard Sekles and Iwan Knorr. She also studied in Vienna with the famed Polish pianist and professor, Theodor Leschetizky. She went on tour in Australia in 1905, and performed in Europe under the stage name Ethel Leginska from 1906 on, at the suggestion of British socialite Lady Maud Warrender (the wife of Sir George Warrender), as at that time the best top-class musicians were Polish, hence the Polish-sounding name \\"Leginska\\" considered advantageous to the development of the young pianist musical career.Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green. 1980. Notable American women: the modern period : a biographical dictionary. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. p. 416 She kept that name throughout her career and upon her debut in the United States she was dubbed by the press \\"The Paderewski of women pianists\\". In 1907 Leginska married the composer Emerson Whithorne, whom she had met when they both studied in Vienna. They would sometimes perform together, with him playing the second part in two-piano pieces on her recitals and from the time they married through 1909 him serving as her concert manager. He later wrote music criticism for \\"Musical America\\" and \\"Paul Mall Gazette\\", and as a composer, he had his music performed frequently in the 1920s and 1930s.Macleod, Beth Abelson. 2000. Women performing music: the emergence of American women as classical instrumentalists and conductors. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. p. 97 She and Emerson Whithorne had one son, Cedric Whithorne, born in September 1908 after the couple returned from visiting Whithorne's native United States. They did so at least once prior to their divorce, traveling to Cleveland, OH where Leginska make her unofficial American debut in Cleveland's Hippodrome, a vaudeville theater.Women Performing Music: The Emergence of American Women as Instrumentalists and Conductors. By Beth Abelson Macleod. Jefferson, North Carolina and London: McFarland & Company, 2001, p.97 Nonetheless, the couple separated in 1910 and divorced in 1916. After an unsuccessful custody fight for her son Cedric, Leginska became even more outspoken about inadequate opportunities for women, stating that self-sacrifice for family's sake is \\"over-rated\\" and that \\"it is impossible for a woman with a career to be unselfish\\".Women Performing Music: The Emergence of American Women as Instrumentalists and Conductors. By Beth Abelson Macleod (Jefferson, North Carolina and London: McFarland & Company, 2001, p. 98 From her official American debut in New York's Aeolian Hall on 20 January 1913, Leginska's popularity in the U.S. was growing, aided by both the careful staging of her performances, with well-thought-out lighting and decor to focus on the performer, and her distinctive style of dressing (favoring menswear) eagerly copied by her young fans, as well as her diminutive size and her youthful appearance that not only made the musical youth more likely to relate to her, but often misled not only her audiences but even the reviewers who would express their astonishment that a person so \\"young\\" displayed such skill as hers (this going on all the way into Leginska's late thirties, as made evident in the Detroit News critic Robert Kelly's description of her perform at 37).Macleod, Beth Abelson. 2000. Women performing music: the emergence of American women as classical instrumentalists and conductors. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. p. 102 In 1923, Leginska went to London to study orchestral conducting with Eugene Goossens. She also studied conducting with Robert Heger, conductor of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, proceeding to conduct as guest conductor with major orchestras in Munich, Paris, London or Berlin, taking advantage of her earlier contacts established when she performed as a pianist, as well as agreeing to also perform in a concerto on the programs. Being a woman conductor also helped her attract attention, as a novelty. She conducted a performance of her orchestral suite Quatre sujets barbares. In 1925, she made her debut as a conductor in the United States with the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, after which she appeared with the Boston People's Orchestra in the spring and then performing at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1925. She had suffered nervous breakdowns in 1909, 1925 and 1926. In 1926 she announced a permanent retirement from performing as a pianist and focused on conducting, composing and teaching. Ethel Leginska sitting at a piano Though her output as a composer was limited, she distinguished herself as an organizer, establishing the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra which she conducted (1926‚Äì27), heading the Boston Woman's Symphony Orchestra (1926-1930) with which she went on two extensive tours.Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green. 1980. Notable American women: the modern period : a biographical dictionary. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. pp. 416-417 She also directed the Boston English Opera Company, founded the National Women's Symphony Orchestra in New York in 1932 and served as director of the Chicago Women's Symphony Orchestra. In the late 1930s, when her conducting opportunities began to diminish as her novelty wore off, she left the U.S. again, to teach piano in London and Paris before settling in 1939 in Los Angeles. She opened a piano studio and was a well-respected teacher into the 1950s. In the meantime, in 1943, she founded the concert series New Ventures in Music, with Mary Holloway, mainly to promote her pupils.Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green. 1980. Notable American women: the modern period : a biographical dictionary. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. p. 417 In 1957 she once again conducted - a Los Angeles performance of her first opera The Rose and the Ring, written in 1932. Ethel Leginska died in Los Angeles of a stroke on 26 February 1970, aged 83. As professor After 1935, work opportunities seem to decrease for Leginska. In 1938, she lived in London and Paris where she taught, before finally settling in Los Angeles in 1939. There she worked as a piano teacher of notable reputation. Among Leginska's students were pianist and harpsichordist Gavin Williamson, (Williamson was also a long-time student of Artur Schnabel), James Henry Fields, Daniel Pollack, Bruce Sutherland. In a book by Harriette Brower, Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers published in 1915, the following is said about Leginska: \\"I believe in absolute freedom in all parts of the arm, shoulder to fingertips. Rigidity seems to me the most reprehensible thing when playing the piano, which is the most common of all kinds of performers default.\\"Harriette Brower. \\"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers.\\" NY: Frederick A. Stokes Company Publishers, 1915 In 1943, Leginska and her concert manager, Mary V. Holloway, founded the concert series New Ventures in Music with the purpose of introducing her talented young pupils to the public by having them perform works of great composers in recital.Marguerite and Terry Broadbent. \\"Leginska: Forgotten Genius in Music.\\" Cheshire, UK: North West Player Piano Association, 2002, p. 242 The scope of the concerts were such that by the end of the second year of the series, the two books of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier as well as all of Beethoven's sonatas and variations had been performed by the young musicians. The third and fourth series of concerts were devoted to the entire works of Chopin and Schumann.Marguerite and Terry Broadbent. \\"Leginska: Forgotten Genius in Music.\\" Cheshire, UK: North West Player Piano Association, 2002, p. 243 The concerts were a great success, receiving accolades from world celebrities such as Bruno Walter, Arthur Rubinstein, and Serge Koussevitsky, and became a fixture of the musical life in Los Angeles. When piano concertos were performed, Leginska hired members of professional orchestras such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic and formed her own \\"Leginska Little Symphony,\\" which she conducted herself. As composer In addition to her concert career, Leginska took courses in harmony with Rubin Goldmark from 1914, and lessons in composition with Ernest Bloch in New York from the summer of 1918 on. She soon followed these classes with composition of a range of pieces for piano and chamber ensembles. The first work performed in public, which was something rare for a woman at the time, was a string quartet inspired by four texts by the Indian poet Tagore, which won a composition prize in the Berkshire Chamber Music Festival Competition. The symphonic poem Beyond the Fields We Know with the title borrowed from poet Lord Dunsany came shortly after. The Gargoyles of Notre Dame was inspired by Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and her four-movement orchestral suite Quatre sujets barbares is a musical work inspired by the life and paintings of French artist Paul Gauguin. In 1957 in Los Angeles, Leginska gave the premiere of her opera The Rose and the Ring, based on William Makepeace Thackeray's story of the same name, written a quarter of a century earlier. Works Ethel Leginska's body of work is relatively small, consisting of piano pieces and songs, excluding her orchestral works and three operas. Among her major compositions are quartets for strings and piano, four Poems and six nursery rhymes.

Prior to that they attended services at St. Peter's Church conducted by German priests from New York City. That same year, the first church was started and a cornerstone laid. The first pastor was the Rev. Joseph Schaefler, who had served the community previously at St. Peter's, and he swiftly raised the capital to erect a rectory and school. St. Michael's parochial school opened in 1853. Father Roesch came from Carinthia to minister to the German and Slovenian-speaking Catholics. (In 1923, the Slovak community would purchase a former Lutheran church on Grand Street and found the parish of St. John the Baptist.)

The decision to re- locate the parish outside the city caused some consternation in Poughkeepsie's German community which had been saving towards building a new church.

In March 2010, the Ayush Department of the Union Health Ministry decided to bifurcate CCRAS to create an exclusive body for Siddha research called the Central Council of Research in Siddha (CCRS), after a long period of pressure from the Siddha community in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere. The new council was decided to be headquartered in Chennai, and the council was officially formed in September 2010. Location The institute is located alongside the GST Road in Tambaram Sanatorium, about 6 km from Chennai Airport. The nearest railway station is the Tambaram Sanatorium Railway Station located about 100 m from the campus. Facilities There is an attached hospital‚ÄîAyothidoss Pandithar Hospital, named after Ayothidasa Pandithar, a renowned traditional Siddha physician. There is an out-patient (OP) department where patients are treated free of cost. On an average, more than 1,500 patients are being treated in out-patient department every day. There is also an in-patient (IP) department with a capacity of 120 beds. The Ayothidoss Pandithar Hospital reported around 2,174 patients per day during 2017‚Äì18, up from around 700 patients per day in 2016. Future developments In 2010, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) declared the institute, (which is located on the remains of megalithic burials sites), as a protected monument, resulting in a ban imposed by the National Monuments Authority (NMA) on renovation or repairs of the existing buildings at the premises. In May 2018, foundation stone was laid for the construction of the Central Council for Research in Siddha's headquarters. The four-storeyed building will have a total area of 1,680 square metres. A new out-patient department block with 30 consulting rooms, 20 dispensing counters and 30 external therapy rooms, and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 500 will also be built. The total cost of all these was 316.5 million.

Carr (1877‚Äì1936), whose byline for most of his career was Harry Carr, was an American reporter, editor and columnist for the Los Angeles Times. In 1934 he was given an honorable mention by a Pulitzer Prize committee on awards. When a heart attack claimed his life at the age of fifty-eight, his funeral was attended by more than a thousand people.

The resourceful Carr, however, spied on the troupe through an alley window, wrote a story about it and it was printed. Subsequent stories brought Carr's talent to the attention of Harry Andrews, then managing editor of the Times, so he sent for Carr and gave him a job. Carr's earthquake story and two of his photos took up almost the entire front page. Carr's reputation soared with his eyewitness coverage of the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. He was the first outside reporter to make his way to the shattered city and his efforts resulted in \\"four or five full newspaper pages of print, the longest story I ever saw in a paper,\\" said John Von Blon, an assistant city editor at the time. \\"I locked Harry in a room in the morning, brought him his luncheon and dinner and kept him right at it.\\" \\"Quake 'Beat' Won Glory,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 11, 1936, page 3 His coverage, reporting and writing was \\"one of the greatest stories of modern times, one that is still regarded by newspapermen all over the world as a model for the chronicling of some tremendous and awful event,\\" a colleague, Julian Johnson, recalled thirty years later.\\"Carr News Beat Gets New Praise,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 12, 1936The story, with photographs Carr took himself, can be seen here.

The service got its name from the bright red color of its cars.The Oregon Electric was sometimes called the \\"Green Electric\\" in reference to the color of its cars and in contrast to the Red Electric. Despite its short history, among West Coast interurbans it was unique, and it was considered the finest such system in the Pacific Northwest. It was the only major electric interurban railroad converted from steam to electric passenger use. It was also one of few systems using all-steel equipment, and one of the largest 1500-volt systems in the country. History The Oregon Electric Railway completed an interurban line from Portland to Eugene in 1912, as well as several branch lines to agricultural, business, and population centers in the Willamette Valley. The Southern Pacific (SP), feeling threatened by this competition, researched the feasibility of electrifying most of its Willamette Valley trackage. At the time, electric traction was seen as the way of the future, and in 1912, SP began converting existing steam routes to overhead electrification. Via the Red Electric system, which SP established on rail lines it acquired from the Portland, Eugene and Eastern Railway (PE&E;), the company planned to electrify all of its Oregon trackage except for its main line through the valley from Portland to California. The projected growth of the rural areas outside the main population centers of Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Albany and Eugene, however, did not materialize, despite the efforts of real estate promoters. The combination of this lack of growth, World War I and the rise of the automobile meant that the Red Electric system was far smaller than originally intended. The final Red Electric run took place on October 5, 1929. Construction Southern Pacific acquired the Portland, Eugene and Eastern in 1912. The PE&E; was developed by Alvadore Welch, who owned the streetcar system in Salem, the streetcar connecting Eugene with Springfield, and the Corvallis and Alsea River Railway, a steam line that was being developed from Corvallis to Monroe. Southern Pacific added its Westside and Yamhill branches between Portland and Corvallis to the PE&E;, as well as acquiring and adding the Sheridan and Willamina Railroad and the Willamette Falls Railway. SP began electrifying the PE&E; steam lines soon after acquiring them. Interurban service began operation on January 17, 1914, under the Portland, Eugene and Eastern name, but SP replaced references to PE&E; with \\"Southern Pacific Lines\\" in 1915. The service soon became known as the SP Red Electric. Initial service extended from Portland to Whiteson (south of McMinnville), but eventually reached Corvallis, in 1917. Southern Pacific proposed several new lines or the electrification of existing lines within its system, but most of these were never built or converted. Instead, the company concentrated on upgrading and electrifying its existing steam lines between Portland and McMinnville. Routes Route of former service Former Hillsboro depot that still includes sign indicating distance to Corvallis at end of the line Trains originated at Union Station in Portland. The \\"Westside\\" route connected Beaverton, Hillsboro, Forest Grove and Carlton. The \\"Eastside\\" line served Oswego, Sherwood, Newberg and Lafayette. The two routes connected in Saint Joseph, just north of McMinnville, and continued to Corvallis as a single line. Service to Corvallis was inaugurated on June 17, 1917. The main Portland‚ÄìCorvallis line was long, and the entire Red Electric network encompassed of track, served by 64 trains per day. In 1920, the schedule had four daily trains through from Portland to Corvallis in each direction and two more that ran as far as Whiteson. Closer to Portland, Red Electric service was much more frequent. Service on the Westside line ran for the last time on July 28, 1929, thereby ending all SP interurban service to Beaverton, Hillsboro, and Forest Grove, among other places situated along only that SP line, some of which continued to be served by interurbans of the Oregon Electric Railway for another three years. The remaining Red Electric service ended only a little more than two months later, on October 5, 1929, with the final runs on the Eastside line. Wreck The worst train accident in the history of Oregon interurban railways occurred east of the depot at Bertha (now within the Hillsdale neighborhood) on May 9, 1920. Two trains collided head-on, killing the engineer of one train instantly. Two other employees and five passengers were also killed, and ten employees and 92 passengers were injured. One of the injured passengers later died. It was hard for rescuers to quickly reach what was at the time a remote location. Remnants The Red Electric substation in Lake Oswego was later converted into apartments that are still in use today. The Forest Grove depot was purchased by a grass seed broker in 1948 and still exists today. The McMinnville Red Electric depot, similar in structure to the Forest Grove depot, is still in operation, as is the Hillsboro depot. They are the only two original depots that still exist on the old Red Electric route. As of 1994, the former substation in Dundee was being used as a garage. The abandoned substation in McCoy, built in 1916, still exists. Between Portland and Oswego (now called Lake Oswego), most of the track of the Red Electric's \\"East Side\\" line remained in use by SP freight trains until 1983, and since 1987 has been used by the Willamette Shore Trolley heritage streetcar service. SP sold that approximately section of rail line in 1988 to a consortium of local governments who wanted to preserve it for possible future rail transit use. Parts of the former Red Electric alignment in southwest Portland are being studied for use as a trail connecting existing bike and pedestrian trails within Portland Parks & Recreation's trail system.

Summoned on 24 July 1679, but prorogued by the king so that it did not assemble until 21 October 1680, it was dissolved three months later on 18 January 1680/81. Background Succeeding the long Cavalier Parliament and the short-lived Habeas Corpus Parliament of March to July 1679, this was the third parliament of the King's reign. Its character was much influenced by the aftermath of the Popish Plot crisis. On 15 May 1679, the supporters of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, had introduced the Exclusion Bill into the Commons with the aim of excluding the king's brother, James, Duke of York, from the succession to the throne. A fringe group began to support the claim of Charles's illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth. As it seemed likely that the bill would pass, Charles exercised his Royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament.Dates of Parliaments at adam-matthew- publications.co.ukJoseph Robson Tanner, English Constitutional Conflicts of the Seventeenth Century (1928), p. viii online History A new parliament was summoned on 24 July 1679, and elections to the new House of Commons were held on various dates in the weeks which followed, but in general they went badly for the court party. With parliament expected to meet in October 1679, King Charles prorogued the parliament until 26 January 1680.Tim Harris, 'Cooper, Anthony Ashley', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004‚Äì2007, Shaftesbury was anxious that the king might be intending not to meet this new parliament, so he launched a petitioning campaign to pressure the king to do so. He also wrote to the Duke of Monmouth, advising him to return from exile, and on 27 November 1679 Monmouth entered London amid scenes of widespread celebration. On 7 December 1679, a petition signed by Shaftesbury and fifteen other Whig peers called on Charles to meet parliament, and this was followed on 13 January 1679/80 by a similar petition of 20,000 signatures. However, instead of meeting parliament Charles further prorogued it and recalled his brother the Duke of York from Scotland. With this, Shaftesbury urged his friends on the Privy Council to resign, and four did so. This agitation was opposed by George Jeffreys and Francis Wythens, who presented addresses expressing abhorrence of the petitioners, thus initiating the movement of the Abhorrers, who supported the actions of the king. Roger North noted that \\"The frolic went all over England\\", and the addresses of the Abhorrers from around the country formed a counterblast to those of the Petitioners. Shaftesbury's party sought to establish a mass movement to keep alive the fears raised by the Popish Plot, organising huge processions in London in which the Pope was burnt in effigy. The King's supporters mustered their own propaganda in the form of memoirs of the Commonwealth government of Oliver Cromwell and its austerities. The King labelled the Whigs as subversives and nonconformists, and by early 1681 Shaftesbury's mass movement had died down. Throughout the life of the parliament the supporters of Shaftesbury, becoming known as the Whigs, continued in their attempts to promote and pass the Exclusion Bill, and Charles had little doubt that it would pass the House of Commons, if not the Lords. The natural supporters of the king and his brother in the parliament were the High Anglicans, who as a political faction opposing the Exclusion Bill were known first as the Abhorrers, later as the Tories.Clement Boulton Roylance Kent, The early history of the Tories: from the accession of Charles the Second to the death of William the Third (1660‚Äì1702) (1908), pp. 258‚Äì264 On 24 March 1680, Shaftesbury told the Privy Council he had received news that the Roman Catholics of Ireland were about to launch a rebellion, backed by the French. Several Privy Councillors, including Henry Coventry, thought Shaftesbury was making this story up to inflame public opinion, so an investigation was launched. This ultimately resulted in the execution of Oliver Plunkett, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, on spurious charges. On 26 June 1680, Shaftesbury led a group of fifteen peers and commoners who presented an indictment to the Middlesex grand jury in Westminster Hall, charging the Duke of York with being a popish recusant, in violation of the penal laws. Before the grand jury could act, it was dismissed for interfering in matters of state. The next week, Shaftesbury again tried to indict the Duke of York, but again the grand jury was dismissed before it could take any action. Parliament finally met on 21 October 1680, when the Commons elected for the first time William Williams as Speaker. He became the first Speaker of the House of Commons from Wales. On 23 October, Shaftesbury in the House of Lords called for a committee to be set up to investigate the Popish Plot. The Exclusion Bill, which as widely foreseen had been passed by the Commons, came before the Lords on 15 November, when Shaftesbury gave an impassioned speech in favour of it, but the Lords rejected the Bill by 63 votes to 30. The Lords now wished to explore alternative ways of limiting the powers of a Roman Catholic successor to the throne, but Shaftesbury argued that the only viable alternative to exclusion was calling on the king to marry again and provide a new heir. On 23 December 1680, Shaftesbury gave another strong pro-Exclusion speech in the Lords, in the course of which he attacked the Duke of York, stated his mistrust of Charles II, and urged parliament not to approve any further taxes until \\"the King shall satisfie the People, that what we give is not to make us Slaves and Papists\\". With parliament pursuing the Irish investigation vigorously and threatening to impeach some of the king's judges, Charles prorogued parliament on 10 January 1680/81, and then dissolved it on 18 January, calling for fresh elections for a new Commons, intending the next parliament to meet at Oxford. On 25 January, Shaftesbury, Essex, and Salisbury presented the king with a petition signed by sixteen peers asking that parliament should be held at Westminster Hall rather than Oxford, but the king remained committed to his intention. The next parliament was the Oxford Parliament of 1681.

OWN has seen double and triple-digit ratings growth following the success of series The Haves and Haves Not and Greenleaf.https://corporate.discovery.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/11/159035_GLOBE_2015_Q3_WEB.pdf During Zaslav's tenure, Discovery International has expanded rapidly with networks in more than 220 countries and territories.https://corporate.discovery.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/02/GLOBE_2015_Q4_AT_A_GLANCE_WEB-FINAL.pdf Zaslav has led Discovery's expansion into sports with the acquisition of Eurosport, a pay-TV sports provider reaching hundreds of millions of viewers across Europe and Asia via Eurosport, Eurosport 2 and Eurosport News, as well as Eurosport.com and the Eurosport Player. In June 2015, Discovery and Eurosport acquired all TV and multi-platform broadcast rights in Europe for the 2018‚Äì2024 Olympic Games. David has been quoted that the strategy for the European market is to profit off of the current IP's they have acquired and only add additional ones opportunistically. They have focused on the Eurosport Player OTT service, which offers live streams of linear channels, but also added content, such as tennis action from up to 16 courts at the Australian Open as well as adding country-by-country popular sports content. The Eurosport Player, as of May 2017, had grown almost 50% year over year. Other recent international investments include Switchover Media (owner of a suite of four free-to-air channels in Italy) and Fatafeat (a female lifestyle network in the Middle East). The company also has focused on investing in resources and talent to strengthen its global content pipeline, including the acquisition of UK-based independent production house betty, and its joint venture agreement with Liberty Global to acquire All3Media.http://www.libertyglobal.com/pdf/press- release/09-23-All3Media-release-FINAL.pdf In November 2015, Zaslav struck a deal for Discovery to take a 3.4% interest in Lionsgate and joined the company's board. \\"As with all our creative partners, we look forward to telling world-class stories with Jon and the deep management team at Lionsgate, and further strengthening Discovery's content pipeline across our linear and digital platforms around the world,\\" Zaslav said. Zaslav also has led the growth of the company's education division, Discovery Education, now the nation's leading provider of digital content, reaching 3 million teachers and more than 30 million students. In October 2016, Discovery Inc. purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media ‚Äì a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery's digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake. David Zaslav spearheaded a partnership with BAMTech in November 2016 to launch BAMTech Europe. Eurosport Digital will be the first client in order to upgrade its suite of digital products to be powered by BAMTech's video platform. On July 31, 2017, Discovery announced it would acquire Scripps Networks Interactive for $14.6 billion, pending regulatory approval. In November 2018, Discovery announced a partnership with Tiger Woods and Discovery's GolfTV. In January 2019, Discovery announced the purchase of 71% of Play Sports Group, a global cycling brand. = Discovery Impact = Discovery has expanded its corporate social responsibility and environmental programs.

Biography  Fitzgerald was born in South Africa. Some of her life is reported in Nomad (1992), an autobiographical account of her first period of residence and deportation from Kenya, where she had lived for 22 years and raised a family. In Nairobi she had two daughters and adopted a Samburu son, gained a divorce, and became a well-known journalist writing on African affairs, working for the Financial Times, The Sunday Times and other newspapers. She initially reported on economics, but became increasingly involved in political journalism and exposing corruption and human rights abuses. She also helped to establish a health clinic in a disused government building in Lesirikan, Samburu District, in northern Kenya. During this time she encountered the well known explorer Wilfred Thesiger, who was based near Maralal, but initially receiving a frosty reception. The clinic later became the highly successful NGO ICROSS, and she established SAIDIA after being removed from ICROSS, which has attracted worldwide acclaim for its health programs. Fitzgerald attracted the ire of Daniel arap Moi's government in the 1980s. She was briefly imprisoned in 1987, in squalid conditions, for a minor foreign currency infraction. It is believed the charge was prosecuted because she had recently reported for The Sunday Times on illegal exports by two powerful Indian business partners directly connected with President Moi, (K. Somaia and N.Merali, exporting Kenyan coffee through the black market). Her court conviction was later exploited by the government to challenge her credibility as a journalist. In 1988, she published an article in The Sunday Times documenting how the Kenyan judiciary was directly manipulated by the government to curb political opposition, and how this had led to widespread and well documented human rights abuses. Returning at the end of 1988 to Nairobi on a flight from London she was stalked by the secret police and then deported. Without a home or money, and homesick for Kenya, she eventually settled in London with her daughters. They shared a flat with Kathy Eldon, former Kenya resident and mother of photojournalist Dan Eldon. After working as a roving journalist (below), she next returned to Kenya for Dan Eldon's funeral in July 1993, by which time she was again allowed to enter the country. The Epilogue to Nomad (1994 version) said she planned to remain in London. Yet in 1997 she worked for UNICEF in New York, and a 2001 article in The New York Times stated that she had returned to Kenya after that, where she spent several years as Africa Representative for the NGO Refugees International. She also published another book on her adoption of a Maasai boy (My Warrior Son, 1998). Her change in direction from journalism to humanitarian relief work resulted in several strong press releases, reports and articles on the refugee crisis in Kenya and neighbouring countries (listed below). In 2000, she visited Eritrea forRefugees International to assess the forced recruitment of child soldiers, just when fighting broke out with Ethiopia ‚Äì women, children and the elderly fled aerial and artillery attacks. In 2002, she published a book on the plight of women in Southern Sudan and the refugees from that region living in camps in Kenya. She is still on the Boards of SAIDIA and ACE Kenya.  Journalism  As an established journalist and fluent in Swahili and French, after her deportation in 1988 Fitzgerald was able to secure press assignments elsewhere in Africa with a number of newspapers. Already familiar with Ethiopia, she reported in January 1990 from the war zones in the north where the Tigray resistance was gradually breaking the brutal regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam, and she narrowly escaped bombs launched by the government's MiG fighters. Another assignment took her to Bangui in the Central African Republic to report on new game conservation initiatives and killings of poachers. She was then posted to Liberia to cover the First Liberian Civil War in 1990. She was one of the last journalists remaining in Monrovia before the final attacks and mass killings, witnessing atrocities as Charles Taylor and Prince Johnson approached the city and President Samuel Doe's armed forces tried to eliminate opposition by wiping out opposing clans. Scarred by this experience, she later travelled widely, and reported from parts of the francophone Sahel, Ivory Coast and Senegal, and again in Ethiopia. She also worked for the Financial Times, The Independent, The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune. In her work for Refugees International, she travelled widely from 1998‚Äì2000 and issued press releases to raise awareness of the crises affecting refugees in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Angola and Southern Sudan.

The selection of the winner film is carried out between all sections that make up the Festival: Official Section, Zabaltegi, Horizontes Latinos, Made Spain, etc.  History  In 2000, the idea was raised of creating a gay and lesbian film award in the frame of San Sebasti√°n Film Festival. This idea came up among Gehitu GEHITU (LGBT Association from Bask Country) members, a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender association from the Basque Country. The goal intended, as it was already happening from 1987 on with the Teddy Award in the Berlinale, was that the prize would help gay-theme movies have more relevance in movies theatres as well as in mass media. Kr√°mpack (Nico and Dani in English), from the film director Cesc Gay, was the first film awarded with Sebastiane Prize.\\"Geisemu√° Magazine n.1\\", San Sebastian, March 2001 The film reflected the sexual awakening of two teenagers, as one comes to terms with his homosexuality and the other with his heterosexuality. The jury of this edition was made up by the writer Luis G. Martin, film critic Bego√±a del Teso, Angel Retamar from ZERO magazine, Gehitu members, Patricia Garc√≠a and David Montero.\\"Historia del Palmares del Premio Sebastiane\\",Gehitu Magazine n.60, San Sebasti√°n, Sep. 2009 The name given to the Award, \\"Sebastiane\\", honoured the film with the same name directed in 1976 by British Derek Jarman. It was his first film, in which he portrayed introspectively the Roman soldier Sebastian, martyr of Christianity, later a Middle Age Saint and eventually turned into a homoerotic icon. Saint Sebastian, patron saint of San Sebasti√°n (Donostia), is a root symbol of the city itself, venue of the Festival, but likewise it is too a symbol the homosexual culture itself. That serves a perfect picture to represent the Sebastiane Prize.  Award  The Prize figurine was designed by Enrique Rojas. It represents the silhouette in metal of the image that traditionally has pictured San Sebasti√°n martyr: a half naked body, which torso is pierced by arrows.

The two peaks are the northern Hintere Karlspitze (2,281 m) and the southern Vordere Karlspitze (2,263 m) with its summit cross; they are linked by a sharp, exposed, rocky ar√™te. Seen from the south the Vordere Karlspitze is a huge and very prominent block of rock, whereas the Hintere Karlspitze is hidden behind other (lower) neighbouring mountains.  Location  The Karlspitzen peaks tower over the Ellmauer Tor saddle and Steinerne Rinne couloir to their east and so lie in the heart of the Wilder Kaiser mountains. To the east rise the rather lower summits of the Goinger Halt and Predigtstuhl, immediately to the north are the Fleischbank and Totenkirchl and, further west, separated by the Kopft√∂rl ar√™te, is the higher Ellmauer Halt. Thanks to its location the Karlspitzen have extensive views over both the Wilder Kaiser and also the neighbouring mountain ranges.  Routes  The Karlspitzen are among the more difficult and hence less-frequented summits in the Kaiser. No signposted or secured route runs up to the double peak; all the more reason why Alpine experience, a sense of direction, safe climbing ability and a head for heights are necessary. The normal way starts at the Ellmauer Tor and is only marked by a pair of cairns. Cairns should not be relied on in any case, many are misleading. However, traces of the trail are generally easy to recognise. They lead through a rocky and generally steep Schrofen which involves light climbing of up to grade II difficulty. It takes an hour to reach the Karlspitzen ar√™te where the route branches to the Hinterer and Vorderer Karlspitze.

The network has broadcast tennis events since 1955. The network's tennis coverage normally airs during the afternoon; however for several weeks in the summer, its Sunday coverage during the morning hours of Grand Slam tennis tournaments may start as early as 8:00 a.m., resulting in the pre-emption of regular programming on that day (such as the political talk show Meet the Press). Overview NBC's relationship with tennis dates as far back as August 9, 1939. While at the amateur Eastern Grass Court Championships, in Rye, New York, NBC broadcast the first ever televised tennis match. NBC made history again at the 1955 Davis Cup, where they televised the first tennis match (United States vs. Australia) in color. =US Nationals coverage= NBC broadcast the US Nationals as early as 1955 and at least up until 1961. Bud Palmer, Jack Kramer, Lindsey Nelson, Don Budge, Bill Stern and Bill Talbert were among the commentators during this period. =Wimbledon coverage= NBC broadcast The Championships, Wimbledon beginning 1969. Americans had made a tradition of NBC's \\"Breakfast at Wimbledon\\" specials during the tournament on weekends, in which live coverage (which under the guidance of then-NBC Sports executive producer Don Ohlmeyer and associate producer Bob Basche, began in 1979 for the men's rounds and in 1982 for the women) started early in the morning (as the Eastern Time Zone in the United States is five hours behind the United Kingdom) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and patterned trousers are well-known to tennis fans in the United States. Collins was fired by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, which holds the Wimbledon cable rights. For many years, NBC's primary host was Dick Enberg, who called his 28th and final Wimbledon in 2011. The AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of Today at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the Eastern Time Zone and using tape-delay in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in 2009, ESPN2's coverage of the Tommy Haas-Novak Djokovic quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous Ivo Karloviƒá-Roger Federer quarterfinal in full. The 2011 tournament marked the 43rd and final year of NBC's coverage. NBC issued a statement saying it had been outbid for the rights to future broadcasts, and beginning with the 2012 tournament, all live coverage moved exclusively to ESPN. Wimbledon became the second tennis Grand Slam event (after the Australian Open) to air live coverage in the United States exclusively on pay television, although replays of the tournament finals have aired on broadcast network ABC. =French Open coverage= NBC's coverage of the French Open began in 1975. Other than a three-year stint for the tournament on CBS, NBC has remained the U.S. broadcast television home of the French Open since 1983. The network shows weekend morning early-round matches in the afternoon on tape-delay; however, if a match is still being played, it will televise the match live. NBC's current deal for the tournament does not allow ESPN2 or Tennis Channel to show NBC's tape-delayed matches. NBC also tape-delays the men's semifinal, broadcasting it in the late morning on the same day, however it broadcasts both finals live. On August 5, 2012, NBC announced it had extended its broadcast agreement through 2024. Under the terms of this new deal, NBC would broadcast an additional ten hours of live coverage, including matches on Memorial Day and the women's semifinals. With the United States Tennis Association (USTA) agreeing to an eleven-year deal with ESPN for exclusive broadcast rights to the US Open, the French Open will be the only tennis tournament on American network television. =Olympic Games coverage= In 2004 and 2006, Bravo carried overnight and morning coverage of the Olympic Games from NBC Sports. In 2008, the channel did not carry any coverage, as NBCUniversal had acquired Oxygen, allowing Bravo to continue to carry its regular entertainment programming schedule during NBC's coverage of the Games. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, NBC Sports announced that Bravo would serve as the home of Olympic tennis events, providing 56 hours of coverage.

A modernized graphics package for the telecasts rolled out in 1999, based around translucent black rectangles, with beveled gold bars at the top and bottom, with blue accents for most sports (green for golf, purple for Wimbledon, and orange for the tennis French Open). Scoring bugs were still not a permanent feature, as they disappeared during plays until 2005, when the network introduced horizontal scorebars for its coverage of college football and hockey, which did not match the other graphics. The graphics, which still did not have any animation, were modified in 2002 to feature rounded edges, and the translucent color was changed from black to the color of the accents, which also replaced gold as the border color.

In June 1841, he was asked by some of the electors in the borough of Thetford in Norfolk to contest the seat at the imminent general election. Nominations took place on 29 June, when Flower was nominated by Andrew Young and W. Watts Wickes. A show of hands declared to be in favour of Flower and his fellow Conservative Bingham Baring, but the third candidate and sitting Liberal MP Earl of Euston demanded a poll. Voting took place the following day, on 30 June, and the result was that Flower and Euston tied for second place with 71 votes each. Amidst many challenges to the validity of votes, the mayor refused to exercise a casting vote, and returned the tied result; all three candidates were declared elected to the two seats. Flower submitted a petition, When the votes were scrutinised, Euston's total was reduced by one, and on 4 May 1842 he was declared unduly elected, thereby giving the seat to Flower. He did not contest the seat at the next general election, in 1847.

It has 451 locations in Japan, 22 in Taiwan, and 24 in the United States. While it is a conveyor belt sushi chain, it relies on a high level of automation allowing the average location to function with fifteen to twenty staff members.  Response to COVID-19  During the coronavirus pandemic, the company received $6 million in forgivable loans intended for small businesses from the Paycheck Protection Program. The funds were distributed as part of the government's $2.2 trillion CARES Act and intended to benefit workers at employers with fewer than 500 employees that are unable to obtain credit elsewhere. The loan was returned immediately. At the company‚Äôs website, the CEO explains as below. Dear Friends, When we made the decision to close all of our stores on March 18th, we didn‚Äôt furlough anybody ‚Äì in fact, all employees stayed on at full pay. We did this before the Paycheck Protection Program existed, and before we knew government aid of any kind would be coming. Our decision was based on doing what was right by our employees, and all of our decisions since have been in service of this same goal. It soon became clear that the pandemic was going to last longer than anyone had initially expected. On April 4th, we made the extremely painful decision to furlough a portion of our employees. We kept on our remaining staff at full pay, and to-date have retained roughly 65% of our entire workforce at full pay. When the CARES Act and PPP loans were announced, we were very excited. Receiving a loan not only meant that we could continue to keep paying the remaining staff on payroll, it meant that we could also rehire all of the employees that had been furloughed. We never considered how intense the competition for the loans would be and applied for one immediately, so that we could continue paying our employees even though all of our stores were closed. We were genuinely excited for all restaurants ‚Äì more restaurant jobs were lost than in any other industry, and this was great news for everyone in our industry. Very early in the CARES Act, there‚Äôs an explicit exemption in qualification criteria for businesses with the North American Industry Classification System code 72 ‚Äì accommodation and food services. Given that this was an explicit change from previous SBA criteria, we and others interpreted this as a deliberate effort by lawmakers to further support the restaurant industry, whether you have one or multiple restaurants. With the Paycheck Protection Program, we assumed all restaurant employees would be able to continue being paid, regardless of where they worked, and that the funds would be enough for everyone. This was a wrong assumption. Today, we made the decision to return our PPP loan. This was a difficult decision because our employees are extremely important to us, but it‚Äôs impossible to ignore the fact that our finances allow us to weather financial hardship for a longer period than independent restaurant owners. We hope that these funds will be shared equitably among deserving candidates.

Many institutions, government, charitable, and for-profit organizations require technology development often involving hardware or software design, and the coordination of donors, distributors, and deployers. Technical development overlaps with the fields of technical training, maintenance and support. Opportunity Developing countries lag behind other nations in terms of ready access to the internet, though computer access has started to bridge that gap. Access to computers, or to broadband access, remains rare for half of the world's population.

Africa is composed of 53 countries many gaining independence since 1950 containing 75 unique ethnic groups and approximately 700 million people. It has been colonized and hence influenced strongly by Europeans from France, Portugal, Britain, Spain, Italy and Belgium except for the countries of Ethiopia and Liberia. Martin & O'Meara describe Africa's diversity and some of the issues that it presents: ethnicity, geography, rural/urban life styles, family life (class levels), access to developed world products, education, and media. Despite this somewhat overwhelming diversity in Africa, the need for self-determination by Africans as fought for example by the Nigerian's five Ogoni clans during the 1990s over oil rights is paramount. The \\"bare necessities of life ‚Äì water, electricity, roads, education and a right to self-determination so that we can be responsible for our resources and our environment\\" must be respected. Technology such as computers is considered by some to be important in obtaining such self-determination for Africa especially in the area of education. While it has already had an extreme boost through the independence of many of the African countries, more education can lead to water, electricity, roads and more self-determination. Bill Clinton supports the use of technology in education stating, \\"[s]o, I think that the potential of information technology to empower individuals, promote growth, reduce inequality, increase government capacity, and make citizen interaction with government work better is enormous\\" And at the same forum, Bill Gates further states, \\"Out of 6 billion people, somewhat less than 1 billion are using this technology. ... Part of how to do that is by having community access, getting it into schools and libraries, and many of the projects we've done, both here in Africa and around the world have that theme that, although it won't be in the home at first, it will be accessible.\\" South Africa and the Smart Cape Access Project South Africa has one of the largest and most successful introductions of computers to the residents in Africa with the Smart Cape Access Project initiated in 2000 in Cape Town winning the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Access to Learning Award in 2003 (Valentine, 2004. The project piloted 36 computers in six public libraries in disadvantages areas of Cape Town in 2002 with four computers designated for public use for each library. Libraries had the important structure with security, electricity and telephone connections, and known access by the public. Cape Town City Council sought information from librarians to build their project realizing that free Internet access was critical to the projects success including training, a user guide, help desk support and feedback loop. They anticipated that Internet access would \\"create much-needed jobs for citizens, but ... it can empower people to market themselves, start their own businesses, or gain access to useful information\\". Funding for the project relied on donations and partnerships from private organizations with extensive volunteer help in accessing open-source software that is available from licensed vendors or free on the Internet. While the project has been plagued by slow Internet speeds, long lines of waiting users, hacking and budgets, the demand for more computers remains high. Residents have used Internet access to build their own businesses using Smart Cape for administration, to obtain jobs sometimes over seas, to create some unsanctioned small-scale ventures such as paying an educated user to write one's resume, to write letters, e-mail, play games, complete homework and do research, and to obtain information such as BMW advertisements among other uses. Older people, unemployed youth and school children have been the most prevalent users of the Internet with 79 percent being men. With the first phase of the project completed in 2005 and the second phase consisting of monitoring and evaluation of pilot sites just completed in 2007, the roll out of the final phase of the project is underway. Over one hundred thousand people have made use of the Smart Cape Access Project computers' free access since 2002 (Brown, 2007) which is about one fifth increase in overall access to the Internet for the 3.2 million population of Cape Town increasing total access to 17 percent of the residents in 2008 (Mokgata, 2008). However, the project continues to be plagued by budget issues leading to questions about long-term sustainability because of its heavy reliance on donations and volunteers. The project reports did not address the maintenance of the computers or the network which could also be a rather large expenditure. Of further concern is the lack of use by women and girls, which culturally presents a hierarchy problem because men are the public face, and another topic to consider in the future. Africa and other less successful projects Unlike the Smart Cape Access Project, many other projects that attempt to introduce computers to Africa fail not only in the sustainability issue but also in training, support and feedback. Although in many cases access to the Internet via cable or wireless and electricity remain overwhelming issues. Less than one percent of Africans access broadband and only four percent use the Internet according to the BGBC in an article about Intel backing wireless access in Africa. The cost of wireless remains prohibitive to most Africans and possibly more important is that there is not an overall \\"education model\\" that supports how to integrate forms of hardware to provide the wireless network. Kenya provides an example pursuing the use of fiber optic cable to connect to the Internet thus being able to lower access costs from $7,500 a satellite-delivered megabyte to $400 from present levels. The Alcatel-Lucent project started at the end of 2007 (two year delivery date) and will piggyback on the expansion of electricity to many rural villages providing Internet access. It will also provide speed that is currently lacking with the satellite connection. Freeplay Foundation has attempted to address the issue of electricity by first developing battery powered lights for rural areas of Africa piloting a project also in Kenya in 2008.\\"The World Bank estimates that more than 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity supplies that could be used to light their homes\\" or power computers. Freeplay has also provided a distribution system through women that will provide income in selling, repair and maintenance for customers and is prototyping in Kenya early in 2008. While purchasing the lights may pose a sustainability issue, such inventions could be hopefully tapped for future powering of computers in Africa. An example of further difficulties surrounding introducing computers in Africa is found in the study of Mozambique one of the poorest nations of the world with 60 percent of its population below the poverty line. Despite their poverty, Mozambicans view their education and access to the Internet as only second to obtaining enough food to eat. This is shown in statistics that identify the increase in computers per hundred inhabitants from .08 to 1.6 in just two years between 1996 and 1998. However, in non urban areas where better off residents might make 40 to 60 US dollars a month, access to the Internet could eat up half of their income so community-owned settings have been instituted with some unknown success. Other pilot programs are also proliferating across the country with unknown results at this time. This lack of data regarding the overall implementation of computers in Mozambique highlights the sustainability issue of computers in Africa as does the following example in Cameroon. Cameroon was the recipient of the School of Engineering and Applied Science communication technology through a student volunteer organization. Computers were obtained, shipped, refurbished and integrated with teaching computer skills to residents. A recipient was the Presbyterian Teachers Training College which interacts with primary and secondary schools. However, no maintenance or support procedures and facilities were available as part of this effort and information on the continued value of the project are unavailable. Similarly but on a larger scale, Computer Aid, a British charity, has shipped over 30,000 PCs to 87 developing companies and is currently shipping at a rate of 1,000 a month. While it refurbishes donated computers before shipping, it appears to have not follow up to the placement of computers. However, Rwanda seems to be eager to have these computers and is providing a government sponsored Information and Communication Technology policy with access to computers through schools, community and health projects. While all of these projects are admirable, successful introduction of computers to Africa necessitates more of the United Nations' Millennium Development goals approach which has been agreed to by countries and leading development institutions around the world to promote a comprehensive and coordinated approach to tackling many problems in developing countries (\\"Microsoft technology, partnerships\\", 2006). However, by 2008 Bill Gates had changed his perspective on technology solving problems in Africa stating, \\"I mean, do people have a clear view of what it means to live on $1 a day? ... He openly dismisses the notion that the world's poorest people constitute a significant market for high-tech products anytime soon. ...the world's poorest two billion people desperately need health care right now, not laptops\\". Here the dilemma is introduced to the mix of feeding people from handouts or providing tools for their own self-determination. As a proponent of self- determination not excluding the benefit of philanthropy, a review of projects discussed above and others merged with the successful Fisher approach to KickStart International could provide a framework for more successful introduction of computers to Africa, possibly skipping to first world technology. Martin Fisher: a possible business plan Martin Fisher started KickStart International with Nick Moon in 1991 as a \\"non-profit organization that develops and markets new technologies for use in Africa\\". It develops technologies advocating understanding the cultural factors surrounding making money in Africa rather than an approach of giving away technology with expertise that has little to do with Africa's ability to make a living. Moon and Fisher believe that \\"the poor people don't need handouts, they need concrete opportunities to use their skills and initiative\\". Fisher further states that \\"our approach is to design, market, and sell simple tools that poor entrepreneurs buy and use to create profitable new small businesses and earn a decent income\\". He also stresses the need to build tools that can be supported in Africa using limited materials and assembly methods. They have designed and marketed a number of tools focusing on farming in African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Mali because 80 percent of the poor are farmers having only two assets: land and the skill of farming. For example, KickStart had created a Hip Pump selling for $34.00 allowing a farmer to use the motion of her or his hips against a lever as a drive mechanism. The pump is capable of lifting water from six meters below the ground to 13 meters above it to allow a farmer to irrigate about three-quarters of an acre in eight hours. Other technologies have included pressing oil seeds, making building blocks from compacted soil, baling hay and producing a latrine cover. These technologies are being mass-produced in Africa. The company has successfully sold over 63,000 pumps (Perlin, 2006) and estimates that 42,000 new micro-enterprises have been started using KickStart equipment such as this pump generating more than 42 million US dollars per year in new profits and wages. Fisher and Moon further estimate that they have helped 200,000 people escape from poverty. They have been successful in Africa because they have focused on: 1. Understanding the culture and environment. 2. Providing income producing tools to create new wealth. 3. Building tools that can be supported in the environment. While KickStart has not talked something as technically challenging as computers, its business plan can be easily adapted to the introduction of computers in Africa. For example, the Smart Cape Access Project has shown widespread success understanding the culture and environment of Cape Town, but still is concerned about sustainability and use by women. Most notable, the project needs to consider how access to the Internet can provide income producing tools to create new wealth and pursue a better maintenance plan. Also of importance is inclusion of women and girls' positive impact in the roll out of technologies for the eventual introduction of computers to Africa. Sources of hardware =Inexpensive new computers initiatives= Initiatives such as the OLPC computer and Sakshat Tablet are intended to provide rugged technology at a price affordable for mass deployments.

In some countries charitable NPOs can give tax-deductible donation receipts for computers they're able to refurbish or otherwise reuse. Increased use of technology especially in ICT, low initial cost, and unplanned obsolescence of electrical and electronic equipment has led to an e-waste generation problem for Uganda. A Joint Team from UNEP, NEMA and UCPC, Estimate the current e-waste generated in Uganda at 10,300 tonnes from refrigerators, 3,300 tonnes from TVs, 2,600 tonnes from personal computers, 300 tonnes from printers and 170 tonnes from mobile phones. However, as a result of the ban of used electronics, the accumulation of e-waste from 2010 to 2011 has reduced by a percentage of 40% An e-learning strategy is being developed consultatively involving various stakeholders in the environment sector which yet Uganda has no e-waste recycler with capacity to cab down the problem of accumulation of e-waste.

'The world is not flat and PCs are not, in the hierarchy of human needs, in the first five rungs.'\\"An exclusive interview with Bill Gates (Financial Times Nov. 1, 2013) A 2010 research report from the Governance and Social Development Resource CentreGovernance and Social Development Resource Centre website found \\"Very few ICT4D activities have proved sustainable... Recent research has stressed the need to shift from a technology-led approach, where the emphasis is on technical innovation towards an approach that emphasises innovative use of already established technology (mobiles, radio, television).\\"Helpdesk Research Report: New ICTs for Development (6/14/2010) However, of 27 applications of ICTs for development, E-government, E-learning and E-health were found to be possible of great success, as well as the strengthening of social networks and boosting of security (particularly of women). One key problem is the ability of the recipients to maintain the donated technology and teach others its use.COMPUTERS FOR AFRICA?

The village is also known as Ranpurgarh or simply Ranpur as per the modern usage. The village is historically significant especially during the British Raj when it was the capital of the princely state of Ranpur. The martyrs Shaheed Raghu-Dibakar (Raghunath Mohanty and Dibakar Parida) who were hanged for their resistance to British rule belong to this place.Rajsunakhala & Tang-Chandapur are the nearest Town of Raj- Ranpur, which in almost 14 & 10 km from the village. Rajsunakhala is the most important business Town in Ranpur block under Nayagarh district. Ranapur Jagannath Temple Location and Geography The Raj-Ranpur town is situated at the foothills of Maninag Hills which is a hill-system covering the whole of Ranpur and much of the surrounding areas. It is one of the most important towns in the Nayagarh district and also one of the important places in Odisha. New Jagannath Sadak passes through Raj-Ranpur and it connects Raj-Ranpur with Puri. It is situated at a distance of 63 kilometres south-west of the state capital Bhubaneswar. Also 13 Kilometers from Rajsunakhala. The area covering the town and the surrounding areas experiences a tropical climate as is experienced in most parts of the state. There are numerous fountains and water streams originating and running through the Maninag Hills. Mandakini (also known as Malaguni) is the traditional river associated with the place. Presently this river is in a very bad condition and has almost dried up. It is said that one of the poets of Odisha, Kabibara Radhanath Ray (Poet Radhanath Ray) composed many of his poems sitting beside the Malaguni river while enjoying its beauty. The area is home to one of the biggest biodiversities in the state of Odisha. The varied vegetation includes Coconut trees, Mango trees, teakwood among others. There is also a protected rubber plantation in the area. Apart from these, the place is also important in the agriculture map. Crops like paddy, sugarcane, moong (green gram) are grown in the area making the people of Ranpur self-sufficient in terms of foodgrains available to the people. The crops in this area have faced drought many times because of many factors including the changing climate and the absence of a proper farm irrigation system in the area. This place is known for its cashew plantation. The king's palace is one of the oldest palaces of Odisha. History The area which is now part of the Ranpur town and the surrounding villages have continuously been inhabited by humans since the ancient times. The Maninag Hills has many rocks and geological features which indicate the continuous inhabitation of the area by humans and other animals. As per the traditional legend associated with the place, there used to be an Asura (Demon) named Ranasura who was creating trouble for the population and making their life miserable. The king of Ranpur was able to defeat the demon and kill him. The place has taken its name from the demon and was known as Ranasurapura during the ancient times. The name had changed to Ranpur with due course of time. Irrespective of the assertion that the place has seen continuous human habitation since ancient times, for many scholars and historians, the place was a vast wilderness almost till early medieval times. During the later medieval times, the Kingdom of Ranpur was established. The rulers of Ranpur were in continuous battle with the rulers of surrounding small kingdoms. Many times battles were fought between the rulers of Nayagarh and Ranpur with several military reverses inflicted on each other. Since late medieval times, the rulers of Ranpur have shown their allegiance to the prominent rulers of Odisha. Ranpur has remained as a vassal kingdom of the Surya dynasty of Odisha which had famous kings like Kapilendra Deva, Purushottama Deva and Prataparudra Deva. After 1568, when Odisha fell to the Afghans of Bengal, the rulers showed their allegiance to the Afghans. Shortly afterwards in 1592, Odisha became part of the Mughal Empire after the successful military campaign of Man Singh against the Afghans of Bengal. The rulers of Ranpur again showed allegiance to the Mughals. In 1803, the British occupied Odisha and started administering it as a part of Bengal Presidency. Modern Odisha became a Division within the Bengal Presidency. The rulers of Ranpur along with rulers of other small states and estates within Odisha showed their allegiance to the British. Ranpur formed part of an administrative unit under the British known as the Odisha Tributary States which consisted many princely states of Odisha. Initially the Odisha Tributary States was attached administratively to the Bengal Presidency. On 1 April 1912, Odisha was separated from Bengal and formed part of a new province called Bihar and Odisha. Accordingly, the Odisha Tributary States came to be attached with the Province of Bihar and Odisha and its administration came under the Governor of Bihar and Odisha. The Odisha Tributary States was also known as the Odisha States Agency. On 1 April 1936, Odisha and Bihar became separate provinces and the Odisha States Agency now became associated with the newly formed Odisha province which consisted of six districts: Balasore, Cuttack, Puri, Ganjam, Koraput, Sambalpur. Meanwhile, on 1 April 1933, the Odisha States Agency was merged with the Eastern States Agency which directly came under the administration of the Governor-General instead of a provincial Governor. After India achieved its independence, Ranpur along with the other 23 princely states within the Odisha States were merged with the Province of Odisha. After the independence and merger, many small and medium-sized princely states were made part of surrounding districts or part of newly formed districts. As such Ranpur became part of the Puri district in 1949. By the end of 1950, Odisha had 13 districts. Between 1949 and 1993, Ranpur formed part of the Nayagarh Sub-Division within Puri district. In 1993, during the Janata Dal government of Odisha, the Chief Minister of the state Biju Patnaik resolved to increase the number of districts from 13 to 30. As per this resolution, the erstwhile Puri district was trifurcated into three districts, namely Nayagarh, Puri and Khordha in 1993. With this division and creation of new districts, Ranpur became part of the Nayagarh district on 1 April 1993 and this status continues till today. Demographics and culture Ranapur Jagannath Temple Maninaaga Devi, Ranpur The town is famous for the magnificent Jagannath Temple (Jagannath Mandir in Oriya) which is situated in the main market area of the town. The Hindu deities Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra are worshipped in this temple along with other Hindu Gods and Goddesses. The sanctum sanctorum (Garbha Gruha in Oriya) of the temple houses the three main deities whereas other Gods and Goddesses are worshipped elsewhere within the temple compound. Also famous is the Rath Yatra (Ratha Jatra in Oriya), the Chariot Festival which falls in June/July every year. The three deities Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra visit the Gundicha Temple riding on these three chariots specially designed and decorated for each of them. The devotees pull the chariots with all the enthusiasm and devotion. After nine days, the deities are brought back to the main Temple. The festival attracts a huge crowd from surrounding areas and elsewhere in the district of Nayagarh and other places. The town is also home to two temples dedicated to Shiva. The Swapneshwar Mandir dates from the medieval times whereas the Chandeshwar Mandir is relatively new. Among other sites in the town, is the Royal Palace (Rajaprasada in Oriya) which is situated at the main market area near the Jagannath Temple. Ranpur was one of the 26 princely states(Indian States) which were merged with the modern province of Odisha after India achieved independence in 1947. Owing to its small area and population the native state of Ranpur was placed under Category 'C' states within the Odisha States Agency which was an administrative unit of India during the British rule. Ranpur is also a Legislative Assembly constituency which consists of the town and surrounding areas including nearby small towns of Chandpur and Raj-Sunakhala. Ranpur also is one of the 8 Tehsils within the Nayagarh district. It is also one of the 8 C.D. Blocks in the district. The town's roads connect to other places within the districts of Nayagarh and Khordha including Bhubaneswar, the state capital of Odisha. It has a hospital with proper infrastructure and amenities. The town is also home to the Civil Judge Court of Ranpur which is one of the lower level courts subordinated to the Odisha High Court. Maa Maninaga temple is also a temple in the history of Ranpur. A small temple built on the hilltop, it overlooks the town of Ranpur and has a birds eye view over a long distance. It is a short but arduous trek to the top, and offers views of the surroundings. However, due to the slash and burn method of cultivation by the locals, the green canopy of the hills has completely vanished and is in urgent need of afforestation. Politics Ranpur is one of the 147 Legislative Assembly constituencies of Odisha. There are a total of four assembly constituencies within the district of Nayagarh. The other three constituencies are: Daspalla, Khandapada and Nayagarh. Ranpur has its own representation in the State Legislative Assembly of Odisha ever since the first General Elections were conducted in 1952 after India became a republic. Leaders from different political parties have been representing Ranpur in the Vidhan Sabha. There have been elected MLAs from parties like the Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Janata Party, Janata Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party and the Biju Janata Dal. Shri Ramakanta Mishra from the Congress holds the record for winning the most Vidhan Sabha elections from Ranpur. Among the earlier MLAs since 1952, notable are Raja Brajendra Chandra and Basanta Manjari Devi, both of whom belonged to the Congress Party. Current MLA of Ranpur (Odisha Vidhan Sabha constituency) is Satyanarayan Pradhan.

Life and career She was born in Harlem, New York, and spent much of her childhood in hospital due to a congenital bone condition. By her mid-teens, her condition had stabilised, though she remained unable to walk without crutches or other assistance. She met Carl Feaster of doo-wop group The Chords, who encouraged her to enter talent contests as a singer, and in 1951 she won two consecutive competitions at the Apollo Theater. She was signed by Savoy Records, and had her first recording session with the company in September 1951. Although her early singles were commercially unsuccessful, she was invited by Alan Freed to perform at what later became recognised as the first major rock and roll concert: the Moondog Coronation Ball held in Cleveland, Ohio on March 21, 1952. Because of concerns over crowd safety, the concert was shut down by the authorities after the first song by Paul \\"Hucklebuck\\" Williams, and Dillard did not perform in the event.

Marion, Varetta Dillard, JammUpp #3, 1999 After further tours with Larry Darnell and Wynonie Harris, she had her biggest hit in mid 1953 with \\"Mercy, Mr. Percy\\", which reached No. 6 on the R&B; chart. The track was recorded on May 15, 1953 with George Kelly (tenor sax), Haywood Henry (baritone sax), Lonnie Johnson (guitar), Lee Anderson (piano), Prince Babbs (bass), and Gene Brooks (drums), and was arranged by Leroy Kirkland.Savoy Records Discography, 1953 The song was nationally popular and became her theme song, but she had difficulty following it up and took time off to have a daughter with her husband Ronald Mack. Her next major success, and final chart hit, came in early 1955 when she recorded \\"Johnny Has Gone\\", a tribute to singer Johnny Ace who had died as a result of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot. Dillard's recording was one of the more popular of several tributes to Ace and reached No. 6 on the R&B; chart. She continued to tour, and starred in the first rock and roll show in New Jersey in May 1955. She left the Savoy label in early 1956 and signed for the RCA subsidiary label Groove, where she issued several singles, including \\"I Miss You Jimmy\\", a tribute to James Dean. In 1957, she moved to the main RCA label, and recorded tracks backed by The Cookies and produced by Leiber and Stoller, but they were again unsuccessful commercially, and she was dropped by the label in early 1958. She went on to record for the Triumph label set up by Herb Abramson, and then for the Club label, a subsidiary of MGM. Her last recordings were in 1961. In the early 1960s, she joined her husband's gospel group, the Tri-Odds, who were active in the Civil Rights Movement. She later worked as a music therapist, with chronically ill children. Two compilations of her recordings from the late 1950s, Got You on My Mind and The Lovin' Bird, were issued by Bear Family Records in 1989.

Production  The term \\"calcium ammonium nitrate\\" is applied to multiple different, but closely related formulations. One variety of calcium ammonium nitrate is made by adding powdered limestone to ammonium nitrate; another, fully water-soluble version, is a mixture of calcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, which crystallizes as a hydrated double salt:Yara Calcinit Technical Data 5Ca(NO3)2‚Ä¢NH4NO3‚Ä¢10H2O.

Production of calcium ammonium nitrate consumed 3% of world ammonia production in 2003.  Physical and chemical properties  Calcium ammonium nitrate is hygroscopic. Its dissolution in water is endothermic, leading to its use in some instant cold packs.  Use  Most calcium ammonium nitrate is used as a fertilizer. Fertilizer grade CAN contains roughly 8% calcium and 21-27% nitrogen. CAN is preferred for use on acid soils, as it acidifies soil less than many common nitrogen fertilizers. It is also used in place of ammonium nitrate where ammonium nitrate is banned. Calcium ammonium nitrate is used in some instant cold packs as an alternative to ammonium nitrate. Calcium ammonium nitrate has seen use in improvised explosives.

First notified in 1955, the site has been owned by the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust since 1997. The site is effectively a series of shallow pools alongside the river that have arisen as an effect of colliery subsidence from Alvecote Colliery, which was later merged to form North Warwickshire Colliery and which ceased operation in 1965.
